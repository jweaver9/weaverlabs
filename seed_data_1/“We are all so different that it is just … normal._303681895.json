This paper shedslight on the actual praxis of cultural diversity management by professionals in workplace interactions. Anethnographic study in a Dutch academic hospital showed that normalization practices were obscuring diversityissues and obstructing inclusion of cultural minority professionals. The normalization of professionalism-as-neutral and equality-as-sameness informed the unequal distribution of privilege and disadvantage among pro-fessionals and left no room to question this distribution. Majority and minority professionals disciplinedthemselves and each other in (re)producing an ideal worker norm, essentialized difference and sameness, andexplained away the structural hierarchy involved. To create space for cultural diversity in healthcare organi-zations in the Netherlands and beyond, we need to challenge normalization practices.1. IntroductionCultural diversity is increasingly acknowledged as an importantissue in academic medicine and healthcare organizations inter-nationally. In the United States, diversity management in organizationsbecame an issue in the late 1980s, and it arrived in northwesternEurope 10–20 years later (Holvino & Kamp, 2009; Zanoni, Janssens,Benschop, & Nkomo, 2010). Programs addressing diversity in organi-zations are mainly legitimized by two arguments. The first is based on amoral argument of equality and social justice; it is aimed at equal re-presentation of and equal opportunities for professionals. The second istermed the “business-case scenario” because it argues that diversityamong professionals enables creativity and competitive advantage(Ahmed, 2007; Cox, 1994; Thomas & Ely, 1996).In practice, diversity management is generally thought effective orsuccessful when it enables professionals and organizations to betterconnect with a diverse clientele and society, resulting in improvedperformance for organizations (Prasad & Mills, 1997; Prasad, Pringle, &Konrad, 2006). As such, diversity management often takes on an in-strumental character (Thomas & Ely, 1996) in which “‘the other’ isinvited to the organization, but is only tolerated and accepted in as faras he or she enriches [but does not challenge] the center” (Holvino &Kamp, 2009, p. 399). Thus, diversity management and diversityprograms grounded in equality risk being reduced to “fixing the num-bers” – that is, solely focusing on minority representation without ad-dressing organizational culture – while those programs grounded in thebusiness argument risk being acceptable only when their efforts pro-duce efficiency and create profit. These rather limited options for di-versity programs may be one reason that – in the US context – theprograms seem to have limited impact on recruitment, promotion, andretention of cultural minority professionals (Betancourt, Green, &Carrillo, 2002; Janssens & Zanoni, 2014; Nelson et al., 2002; Turner,González, & Wood, 2008).Critical diversity studies signal the need to move beyond the ofteninstrumental equality perspectives or business perspectives in diversitymanagement (Cox, 1991; Zanoni et al., 2010). They emphasize that, toachieve actual inclusion of diversity, the role of power and the –foundations of – structural inequalities in organizations and diversitymanagement need to be explored (Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013; Van Laer &Janssens, 2011; Zanoni et al., 2010). In this paper, we take a criticaldiversity studies approach toward structural factors of diversity in or-ganizations and contend that for structural inclusion of minority pro-fessionals, diversity programs and diversity research need to considerand critically review work floor and organizational cultures. In parti-cular, we answer Zanoni et al. (2010) call for an increase in criticalempirical research.

Moreover, how power “works” and how the produc-tion and reproduction of norms, privilege, and disadvantage takes placeempirically is largely unclear.To understand the (re)production of norms and privilege/dis-advantage in organizations, we investigated the academic healthcarecontext in the Netherlands. As the combined field of academia, medi-cine, and healthcare is traditionally highly exclusive, hierarchical, andmonocultural (Taylor, 2003), the academic hospital seemed a relevantsetting to study practices of normalization and inclusion of diversity. Toour knowledge, there are no empirical studies in academic hospitalsthat study these topics from a critical diversity perspective. Within theNetherlands, cultural minority professionals in academic hospitals areoverrepresented in support staff but underrepresented in many nursingteams and especially in medical and executive staff (Groeneveld &Verbeek, 2012). Earlier empirical studies on cultural diversity in thissetting indicate that minority professionals, particularly those who are“visibly different,” (e.g., not white, wearing a headscarf), have diffi-culty “fitting in” Leyerzapf & Abma, 2017; Leyerzapf, Abma, Steenwijk,Croiset, & Verdonk, 2015; Leyerzapf, Rifi, Abma, & Verdonk, submitted;Verdonk, Muntinga, Leyerzapf, & Abma, 2015). The lack of diversity inDutch academic hospitals may be due to two factors: the Dutch culture’sself-image as a society of equal opportunities, a tradition of social jus-tice rhetoric combined with the “celebration” of tolerance for diversity(Ahmed, 2007; Essed, 2002; Heres & Benschop, 2010); and, more re-cently, the occurrence of polarized discourses that openly show racisttendencies (Essed & Hoving, 2014). Ghorashi, Carabain, andSzepietowska (2015) observed a general paradox in Dutch society of anexpressed willingness to include diversity but the incapability to do soin practice, which they attribute to deeply rooted assumptions aboutcultural minorities as “the Other,” who are seen as not only differentbut also not competent enough to meet the profile of the “normal em-ployee.” Thus, the Netherlands is an appropriate context for studyingthe empirical workings of structural factors for inclusion.Here, we aim to shed light on the daily praxis of cultural diversitymanagement by professionals – that is, how they perceive and deal withdiversity in interactions at work and how this relates to inclusion andexclusion as well as privilege and disadvantage. By presenting caseexamples from an ethnographic study in a Dutch academic hospital, weaim to illuminate how workplace inequalities take shape and are en-acted. We hope to extend knowledge within critical diversity studies onthe workings of implicit power and normalization in relation to theinclusion of diversity. Ultimately, our objective is to stimulate an in-clusive and equitable workplace and work practice for all professionalsin academic healthcare and other organizational contexts. Before pre-senting and discussing our findings, we explain in our theoretical fra-mework the concepts of power and normalization, and in our metho-dology describe how we operationalized ‘cultural diversity’ and‘minority/majority’.2. Theoretical frameworkDeveloped in the mid-1990s as a reaction to diversity management’sinability to improve the position of minorities (Holvino & Kamp, 2009),critical diversity studies stress the power dynamics and the structural,contextual aspects of shaping diversity and its inclusion in organiza-tions (Zanoni et al., 2010). Critical diversity studies assume thatdominant views on power and diversity prevent power issues and socialhierarchies from being challenged (Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013; Van Laer& Janssens, 2011) as difference – and identity – tend to be reified assomething definite, all-encompassing, and exclusive (i.e., essentialism;Nkomo & Cox, 1996). From such dominant views organizations arerepresented as open, a-political zones in which professionals can “moveneutrally” (Ahmed, 2007). By adopting a power lens, critical diversitystudies have started to approach the topic of diversity in organizationsby involving the concept of difference. They critically address theprocesses through which certain professionals are included on the basisof their perceived fit with and sameness to organizational norms andother, professionals are excluded on the basis of their perceived non-fitand difference (e.g. Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013; Holvino & Kamp, 2009).Analyzing this “difference-sameness” axis (Holvino & Kamp, 2009) is away to start deconstructing the social hierarchies and power structuresin organizations. As these are clearly dynamic, dialectical processes(Atewologun, Sealy, & Vinnicombe, 2016; Van Laer & Janssens, 2011,2014), in particular, the processes of (re)production of these hierarchiesneed to be unraveled.Janssens and Zanoni (2014), Zanoni et al. (2010), and Holvino andKamp (2009) challenged diversity management programs/studies,claiming that these helped to reproduce unequal power relations be-cause they often do not question the strategic, rhetorical objectives ofdiversity management programs and how these reproduce power im-balances and privileges and disadvantages. Indeed, Heres and Benschop(2010) critical analysis of diversity and equality discourses fromleading Dutch companies found that the companies’ diversity man-agement remained limited in its impact because it was “framed as anissue for those who are ‘different,’ not those who, under the dominantnorm system, are seen as ‘normal’” (p. 452) – showing uses of diversitythat are likely to add to exclusion processes. Looking at reproduction ofinequalities, Boogaard and Roggeband (2010) discussed the paradoxthat minority professionals within the Dutch police force occasionallychallenge inequality due to their attributed social identities, yet si-multaneously reproduce inequality as they deploy these same identitiesas positive in order to empower themselves and preserve individualpower. Other critical diversity studies as Van Laer and Janssens onsubtle discrimination (2011), hybrid identity (2014) and agency ofminority (2017), and Atewologun et al. (2016) on minority profes-sionals’ intersectional identity work, similarly put the interplay be-tween structure and agency at the center of their analysis. These studiesshow how this dynamic requires active balancing and compromising ofminority professionals, resulting in spaces for micro-emancipation(Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013), yet not in structural inclusion.In this paper, we adopt a discursive understanding of power, thatmay provide a more constructive way to address power relations in theworkplace and the split minority seem to find themselves in, and that isimportant in view of the objective of critical diversity studies of gen-erating potential for transformation in organizations. Instead of un-derstanding power as domination or hegemonic power in the traditionof e.g. Gramsci (Foldy, 2002), we propose a Foucauldian-inspired per-spective to power. From a perspective of power as domination, power inorganizations is perceived as identifiable, visible and material in forexample occupational hierarchies, as something “in the hands of”leading, “traditional”, and majority professionals “at the expense of”minority (Foldy, 2002; Janssens & Zanoni, 2014). Following Foucault,power is however more implicit, omnipresent and “invisible” (Foucault,1989, 1982; Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013). In this Foucauldian tradition,we approach power as performative as it is enacted within discursivespaces in social interactions and routine practices. Moreover, power isrooted in and expressed through norms, or more precisely in processesof normalization of these everyday behaviour, linguistic expressionsand non-verbal, bodily interactions that are/become internalized andengrained in mind, body, and culture, and are difficult to pinpoint andtransform (Foucault, 1982; Ghorashi & Wels, 2009). Discursive powerand normalization are inherently dynamic and dialectical as they areboth signifiers and signified of social relations between people, namelywho fits in and who deviates. When we focus on normalization prac-tices, we see how power and structures of inequality are thus not uni-laterally oppressive. They are productive as all people are necessarilypart of its enactment, are mutually dependent on each other in thehierarchical production process, and in that sense all “carryH. Leyerzapf et al. Scandinavian Journal of Management 34 (2018) 141–150142responsibility” (Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013). In order to gain insight onthe dynamic, dialectical enactments of power, we focus on the pro-cesses of normalization.With this study, we hope to show how normalization materializes ineveryday encounters on hospital wards and with this to uncover anddeconstruct enabling mechanisms of exclusion/inclusion (Ghorashi &Sabelis, 2013). Previous studies have pointed towards yet not placedthe praxis of normalization at the center of their research and analysis(e.g., Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013; Van Laer & Janssens, 2011). Van Laerand Janssens (2011) described how processes of normalization, legit-imization and naturalization enabled subtle discrimination in theworkplace and worked to disempower minority professionals. Withinan approach of power as discursive and normalized, however, agency ofminority is not restricted to opposing – majority – structure, and em-powerment is an inevitable relational process involving relatively pri-vileged as much as disadvantaged professionals (see also Larruina &Ghorashi, 2016). We therefore look at how privilege and disadvantageare, interrelatedly, reproduced. How the reproduction of power dy-namics via normalization practices happen, as well as what actuallyconstitutes this praxis of normalization is still largely unclear. Studies(e.g. Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013; Larruina & Ghorashi, 2016; Van Laer &Janssens, 2011) make use of different, related concepts besides nor-malization in this context, such as disciplining, internalization, socia-lization, naturalization, legitimization, institutionalization, routiniza-tion, formalization, homogenization, silencing, and it is not clear howthese mutually relate. Therefore, we do not predetermine normalizationbut aim to build an operationalization of its empirical manifestations byanalyzing what is considered “normal” rather than what is considered“different”; how “the Self” is positioned versus “the Other”; and what isimplicitly included and privileged instead of only on what constitutes“difference” and “the Other” (Essed, 2002).3. Methodology3.1. Study design, research team, and research settingThis ethnographic study investigated the diverse lived experiencesand narratives of professionals in their daily work environment (Yanow& Schwartz Shea, 2006; Ybema, Yanow, Wels, & Kamsteeg, 2009).As awareness of identification and positionality is important in thisresearch, we highlight here our own positioning as authors and comeback to it in the discussion (Verdonk & Abma, 2013). We are all female.One of us has been trained as a nurse, and three of us work in a medicalcenter and teach in medicine and health sciences. One of us is not whiteand has a refugee background. The others are white and from themajority Dutch culture – although one has a white non-Dutch father.We are all privileged in that we are highly educated and, as academics,occupy a high socioeconomic position.Five research interns supported data collection. One was male, andone identified as a minority. Two were medical students, one was ahealth sciences student, and two were social science students.The academic hospital where the research was conducted is situatedin the highly urbanized, Western part of the Netherlands, and theuniversity is among the most culturally diverse in the country. Toprotect the privacy of the participants and the wards, we do not give(personal) details about either. We use the term “ward” to indicate theclinical department representing one medical specialty, including itssub-wards, such as admission wards and the outpatient clinic. The term“team” indicates the different professional teams (i.e., nursing, medical,administrative) that operate in these areas.3.2. Participant selection and recruitmentParticipant selection and recruitment was closely related to andinfluenced by our use of the key terms “cultural diversity,” “minority,”and “majority.” Cultural diversity is commonly used in Dutch parlanceand healthcare regarding issues of migration, integration, inclusion,and diversity management. It suggests cultural/ethnic/racial/religiousplurality. We took an emic perspective – “from within” – in this study,asking participants to explain what they perceive as (cultural) diversity.Besides the term “cultural diversity,” or “diversity” for short, we use theterms “(cultural) minority” and “(cultural) majority,” common in di-versity research and scientific debates on inclusion and equality (e.g.,Essed, 2002; Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013). Here majority refers to Dutchprofessionals with dominant Dutch ethnic backgrounds, and minorityrefers to Dutch professionals with non-Dutch ethnic backgrounds.Choosing these categories above other comparable terms used in theNetherlands (such as “autochthones” and “allochthones”) is based onthe critical approach of our study. We believe the category of differenceis connected not solely to ethnic, cultural, or racial difference but alsoto the position of power, that is, the level of privilege.To get a broad spectrum of perspectives, our selection criteria were:diversity in profession (medical, nursing, administrative, paramedic, orsupport staff); position (executive, management, and so on); cultural/ethnic/racial position (majority and minority); gender; age; religiousaffiliation; socioeconomic background; and professional seniority (seeTable 1 for an overview).Recruitment took place by direct approach and by snowball sam-pling. Minority professionals seemed more hesitant or even reluctant toparticipate in interviews than majority professionals, more often sayingthey were too busy to participate or not returning researchers’ phonecalls and emails. This might be due to their not feeling safe enough totell majority researchers their experiences or to their fearing con-sequences at work from being critical about work floor interactions,feelings that may have been increased by the fact that recruitmentsometimes happened via majority executives. Researchers wereTable 1Overview of data collection and participant characteristics.Ward A Ward B Ward C Other wards TotalInterviews (formal & informal), n= 62 By H.L. 7 8 14 2 31By research interns 2 14 15 – 31Participant characteristics of (informal) interviews Gender Female 6 14 22 1 43Male 3 8 7 1 19Cultural background Majority 5 19 21 – 45Minority 4 3 8 2 17Position Nursing staff or doctor’s assistant 3 2 8 – 13Nursing staff executive 4 6 4 – 14Administrative, supportive, or paramedic staff 1 8 2 – 11Medical specialist/executive 1 6 4 2 13Medical specialist-in-training – – 6 – 6Medical student – – 5 – 5Participant observations (approx. 100 h) By H.L. 10 15 10 – 35By research interns 10 35 20 – 65H. Leyerzapf et al. Scandinavian Journal of Management 34 (2018) 141–150143dependent on executives to gain access to the wards and to be able torecruit and collect data; although all general communication about theresearch to professionals was done on behalf of the researchers, leadingprofessionals forwarded these messages across the ward and this pos-sibly affected professionals’ consideration to participate. Overall, therewere few minority professionals to recruit.3.3. Data collectionBased on a literature review, exploratory interviews, and re-searchers’ knowledge, topic lists to structure interviews and participantobservations were formulated (Bernard, 2011). Interview topics were asfollows: participant demographics; professional motivation, careerbackground, current position; recruitment and promotion (executivesonly); daily routine; social interaction with colleagues; professionalnorms and culture; ideas for the future; humor, being critical, positiveand negative work experiences; professional role models; perception of/dealing with cultural diversity; reflections on the research. Topics forparticipant observations were as follows: demographics; purpose,structure, content of activity; interactions between participants andtheir roles during those interactions; atmosphere; communicationstyles, humor, silences, (critical) questions raised, language use, use ofstereotypes, prejudice; talk of cultural diversity, labeling majority/minority, different/same; parallels/differences with interviews, otherobservations; research reflections and researcher expectations.The sequence of interview topics differed in practice. The goal wasto generate reflections about the team, ward, or organizational culture;norms/normativity, difference/“the Other,” and normality/“the Self.”Participants were first asked how they perceived diversity then howthey perceived cultural diversity, to observe possible parallels and dif-ferences in these categorizations and their own identification withthem.In total, 62 interviews, including the exploratory interviews, wereconducted (see Table 1). Fifteen were informal and not recorded. Mostinterviews were conducted individually, though in two cases, twopeople, and in one case, three people, were interviewed together. In-terviews generally lasted 1 hour, ranging from 30min to 2 h, andusually took place in private rooms on the wards, though some wereconducted in one of the hospital cafeteria’s. All formal interviews wererecorded, with verbal consent; they were transcribed, made into shortreports, and sent to participants for member check (Lincoln & Guba,1985). On-site notes were made and later turned into reports (Bernard,2011).Participant observations (approximately 100 h, see Table 1) wereessential in gaining participants’ trust, openness, and commitment,which enabled relationship building (Burlew, 2003). They also helpedus acquire in-depth, contextualized insight into daily interactions andprofessionals’ social identifications and positionings vis à vis collea-gues, which are often difficult to put into words. Again, on-site noteswere turned into extensive reports. Observations were made duringcoffee and lunch breaks, team meetings, management consultations,multidisciplinary patient consultations, patient rounds, and educationalseminars, and ranged from 30min to 8 h. On all three wards, re-searchers also acted as a “shadow observer” (McDonald, 2005), some-times in uniform, for a half- or full-day shift.3.4. Data analysisData collection and analysis happened in parallel as much as pos-sible and provided insight for new data collection (Lincoln & Guba,1985). In this cyclical process, participants were asked to reflect onpreliminary interpretations. Different, parallel methods of data collec-tion, namely, formal interviews, participant observations, and informalconversations during observations, enabled us to visualize dominantand alternative perspectives and narratives (Abma, 2006; Jackson &Mazzei, 2013).Analysis was supported by the use of sensitizing concepts (Denzin,1973). The conducting researcher (first author) read all notes, reports,and transcripts recurrently to thoroughly familiarize herself with thedata and stimulate “close reading” (Yanow & Schwartz Shea, 2006). Shewrote preliminary interpretations, which were extensively discussed byall researchers and analyzed to incorporate methodological, theoretical,and philosophical expertise into the interpretation process. These in-terpretations were subsequently brought back into interviews andparticipant observations to help focus and stimulate deep, critical re-flection by participants and researchers. This “plugging in” of empiricaldata to theoretical knowledge, and vice versa, is described by Jacksonand Mazzei (2013) as thinking with theory and data, and it preventssimplistic interpretivism as well as letting empirical data “speak forthemselves.”An example of how thinking with theory and data worked was ourlabeling of preliminary data with the term “normalization.” Preliminaryinterpretations indicated that the term “cultural diversity” related pri-marily to individual uniqueness and thus all professionals, and de-fended work floor culture and the status quo on the one hand, while onthe other hand it related only to minority people in order to explainexperiences of exclusion of minority and problems with their recruit-ment, selection and retention. This appeared to connect with Ahmed(2007, 2015) on the non-performativity of diversity, that is, the stra-tegic, rhetorical uses of the term “diversity” and diversity-related lan-guage to “silence” diversity programs as potential incentives for orga-nizational change. This led us to review our data, focusing on particularlanguage use such as “normal” and “different,” and pointed us towardprocesses of normalization. In subsequent interviews and observations,we were alert to these particular uses and meanings of “diversity” and“majority/minority” and arguments for inclusion and exclusion of whatis considered normal at work. In this way, normalization – as closelyrelated to performativity of diversity and organizational change – be-came a sensitizing concept in data collection and analysis.3.5. Quality criteria and research ethicsCredibility was enhanced by different data collection methods (tri-angulation), critical discussion, and looking for differences in inter-pretations and exceptions in the data (Yanow & Schwartz Shea, 2006).Comparing data from interviews (what participants narrated) andparticipant observations (how participants related in practice) gener-ated insight into the social praxis of the sensitive, politically laden re-search topics. The first author kept a diary to critically reflect on herown (automatic) assumptions and her role in the research process(Verdonk & Abma, 2013).Credibility was validated by presenting anonymized (preliminary)findings to an interdepartmental committee within the hospital, whichadvocates for inclusion of diversity. Formal quality of the research wasconsented by the Medical Ethical Board of the hospital and the con-ducting department’s science committee.Data collection continued until data and theoretical saturation wasestablished (Lincoln, 1995). Confidentiality – crucial to all participants– was ensured as much as possible by anonymizing reported data andthe research setting. This was especially important due to the difficultyof maintaining anonymity from people familiar with the setting.Privacy was central in handling, transporting, and storing data (Lincoln,1995).4. FindingsBelow we describe participants’ perceptions of and experiences withcultural diversity issues in the workplace.4.1. Diversity as being only about the OtherWhen reflecting on the meaning of diversity at work, both culturalH. Leyerzapf et al. Scandinavian Journal of Management 34 (2018) 141–150144majority and cultural minority participants initially talked only aboutpatients. Majority professionals told of minority patients who did notwant to shake hands with professionals, did not want to be treated by aprofessional of the opposite sex, or did not speak Dutch well, causing“longer-than-necessary consultations” and delay. They also describedpatients bringing or being visited by too many family members, andpatients and their families expecting too much from hospital staff andmedicine in general when facing serious illness. A female minoritynurse told of recurrent situations in which patients did not want to bewashed by her because she wears a headscarf and of how they com-mented on her assumed identity:I just get that every day… patients […] [t]hey assume I’mMoroccan[because of my] appearance – head scarf and… I am dark-skinned[…] And when they hear me talk, it’s like ‘Hey, an accent, your talkis not really Moroccan …’ [laughs] And then it starts! ‘Hey! You’renot Moroccan are you?! […] But your pronunciation is different’ …You know?! This way we always come to the topic of my head scarf,to the Islam.All minority participants reported these types of recurrent experi-ences that they themselves or minority colleagues had had, where –often majority – patients refused their help because of their headscarf orwhere these patients expressed disrespectful comments or questionsabout their minority background.Whereas minority professionals mentioned majority patients whenasked to reflect on diversity issues at work, majority professionalsmostly referenced minority patients. A majority nurse recounted:[S]uch hypes like, shouldn’t we now start translating all our patientletters into Turkish or Moroccan, and should we now learn thatlanguage or not […] I’m a nurse, I am male […] so, uh, I can care fora Moroccan or Turkish female, but, eh, not if it involves the bareskin. So how am I supposed to [do my work]?A female, majority administrator told of a situation in which a“foreign” man in the company of four women fully veiled in black cameto register. She recounted how she was struck by this and thought“these must be his wives.” Immediately, she laughed and added thatthis was a “silly thought, of course.” This situation to her was a clearexample of “diversity in the workplace.” However, it was the only ex-ample she could think of, and she emphasized that cultural diversitywas “not really an issue.”As mentioned, all participants initially considered diversity as arelevant topic at work only in relation to patients. Even the minorityprofessionals who described difficult encounters with majority patientsdid not indicate this was something the organization should address.They presented it as a problem of individual patients; it was a hassle butit did not really affect them:You will always have them, these kinds of patients ... [they can] justbe rude ... That’s just how it is you know.In general, diversity issues involving patients were associated withdifficult, uncomfortable situations, or even “difficult patients” (e.g., notshaking hands), that were seen as obstructing and disrupting normal(clinical) interactions and taking up (too) much time. Hence, diversitywas generally perceived as problematic. Furthermore, diversity wasprimarily interpreted as cultural diversity, which in the Netherlandsalso encompasses ethnic, racial, and religious diversity, but not, forexample, diversity in sexual orientation, gender, or educational back-ground. These narratives indicated an Othering process whereby di-versity became about cultural Others (patients) instead of the normalSelf (professionals). Thus, the role of diversity in professionals’ conduct,attitudes and wellbeing and diversity as a (potential) issue amongprofessionals themselves seemed obscured.4.2. Diversity essentialized as either nice or problematic and not quitenormalEventually, participants related issues of cultural diversity to pro-fessionals and the work floor. It was almost exclusively presented as“nice” or “fun” and useful. Examples involving food were mentioned byboth majority and minority participants, such as festive lunches or the“multicultural” snacks or sweets colleagues brought to celebrate theirbirthdays. All participants, majority and minority alike, used such ex-amples to show how diversity is “normal”. However, they always addedexpressions as “yet no problem at all”, “yet very much valued”, “youknow”, and “gewoon” and “hoor”, Dutch words difficult to translate,used to normalize an argument. Also, most participants stressed howuseful and valuable it is “to have diversity in the team” for working in aplural society. A majority participant said:It’s good to have colleagues who speak another language, you know,know another culture, to help out with patients with diverse back-grounds.Majority participants emphasized the convenience of “having cul-turally diverse colleagues” who would work on Christmas, allowingmajority participants to take that holiday off. Again, they dominantlyreferred to minority colleagues, not mentioning colleagues fromChristian or non-urban backgrounds, for example. Minority participantshad the same argumentation; they stressed the “importance” and“usefulness” of their own and others’ minority backgrounds for en-abling the work practice to deliver “culturally diverse care.” Oneminority participant said:I actually view my background as an asset to the team, you know ...that’s my contribution to the work, that I can help them [majoritycolleagues] with those patients.Diversity in the context of professionals was approached in a ratherinstrumental way. Furthermore, it was put forth as something un-complicated, natural, and not really an issue (i.e., not worth discussingor studying). “Explain to me please why you want to study diversity”[emphasis added], said one of the several executives and medical spe-cialists who implicitly or explicitly made their skepticism known to theresearcher. This constituted a sort of obscuring and explaining away ofdiversity issues as well, because the narrative of diversity as a nonissuewas upheld and stressed even in situations that appeared to be ex-perienced as complicated and difficult.Several majority specialists, for example, spoke about a femalespecialist-in-training who wore long clothes and dark-colored veils.They had pressed her to change her veils in order to “not scare thepatients.” Dark veils “simply did not fit” the work context, they said.They gave this example to illustrate that diversity “is not an issue in ourteam,” since the specialist-in-training, as one of them stressed, “just didthis [without making trouble],” and another added that “that is reallythe only thing we had here [concerning diversity of professionals]. Infact, however, with this story, they implicitly narrated diversity asproblematic, as did the statement they all made that diversity “is noproblem.” This view was supported by the majority specialists’ de-scription of the only minority specialist in their team, saying that “hehas a funny name and accent but, otherwise, you do not notice anythingabout him.”Similarly, minority professionals seemed to explain away the diffi-culties they experienced at work as they presented cultural diversityamong the professionals as unproblematic. Most minority professionalstold us that their religion or their wearing a headscarf, having an ac-cent, not drinking alcohol, or not joining team outings “is just ac-cepted,” “okay,” or “tolerated.” Some stressed that, when they hadworked on other wards, they had felt excluded and experienced dis-criminatory remarks from colleagues. Only a few minority participantsmentioned that, when they or minority colleagues had addressed theconduct of majority professionals or patients that they had experiencedH. Leyerzapf et al. Scandinavian Journal of Management 34 (2018) 141–150145as stigmatizing them because of their cultural background, they feltthey were not taken seriously by majority and sometimes also byminority colleagues. One minority recounted:Uh, ... then they just said it was of course not intended as such andthat I probably heard it wrong or also [that] I must have mis-understood ... and [they] laughed and said I shouldn’t make it soserious.Several majority participants mentioned that minority professionalssometimes “complain” about disrespectful conduct but that theythought this claim was often “biased” and it was “not clever to dealwith it that way.” Overall, both majority and minority participants in-dicated that cultural diversity was not commonly discussed amongcolleagues. Majority participants said, “No, it’s not something we thinkabout really, it’s not important … this is just normal here,” or “We don’tthink it’s a problem.” A minority participant said, “I don’t need to thinkabout it because it’s just accepted here.”However, the way in which diversity was presented and the wordsthat were used – normal, just, okay, no problem – indicated that thestatements obscured an underlying perspective in which the existenceof cultural diversity was in fact a potential problem. Furthermore, itsuggested that cultural diversity among the professionals resulted fromminority professionals being not normal, with their backgrounds,identities, appearances, traditions, and behaviors seen as different anddeviant from the norm. The stories of several minority professionals(doctor’s assistants) in an outpatient clinic, who, as an exception, werevery outspoken, supported this view. They spoke about the majorityspecialists(-in-training) they worked with and who were often dis-respectful to them. One doctor’s assistant said:Then they yell at you like that, just really yell at you, in the hallway,in front of all the patients […] they don’t do that to the [mostlymajority] nurses ... they only do that to us.Several observed situations portrayed the perception of diversity asproblematic and as about being different from the majority culture, aswell as the active explaining away of this perception by both majorityand minority professionals. A majority research intern shadowed aminority support staff member as a form of participant observation.When the minority professional entered the nurses’ administrative of-fice and, addressing all, asked for some information, the nurses directedtheir answers to the majority research intern, who was not wearing auniform and was standing next to the minority professional. “It seemedas if she was just made out of thin air or something!” the intern said.When asked, the minority professional acknowledged that she hadnoticed but said she was “used to that” in a rather excusing way. Wealso observed that – the few – minority professionals who had an ex-ecutive position were regularly the subject of joking and teasing by –subordinate – majority professionals, relating to their minority identity.For example, these majority participants directed the researcher to theirminority colleagues for corroboration that indeed their team was okaywith cultural diversity, saying “Oh, ask [XX], he’s our foreign guy” or“We have [XX], she’s been here for years,” and they called their min-ority colleagues “our diversity” or “our multicultural part.”These examples connect with majority and minority participantsspeaking of minority professionals as “being culturally diverse,” im-plying a norm from which only minority deviate. Moreover, the ex-amples suggest a process of Othering of minority professionals that isobscured, but apparent in the way “their diversity” was to some extenttolerated because nice, fun or useful, yet never quite fitting the norm asit had to be continuously and explicitly defended as being “normal”.4.3. Diversity as individual and professionalism as neutralWhen asked to reflect on what they deem important to the workpractice, all participants said competency and professionalism. Mostminority professionals said that “my diverse background has nothing todo with my work, as only skills, competences, and qualities are im-portant” or “my different background does not matter since they onlylook at how you work.” Majority executives and the few minority ex-ecutives often concluded their reflections on cultural diversity withsaying “But of course, professional quality remains and should remainthe leading consideration.” In this context, some majority executivesbrought up “positive discrimination” (i.e., affirmative action) and ad-dressed their fear that attracting more “diverse professionals” wouldcompromise team quality. One said:We can’t just go and favor culturally diverse professionals… […] welook at their résumé, their experience [...] we have to watch thequality.Competency was mentioned as the only factor that should de-termine whether someone is “a good professional,” and “the only wayyou may/are allowed to discriminate between professionals.” Overall,competency and professional performance were presented as neutraland objective – and independent from cultural, ethnic/racial, or re-ligious identity. Majority executives even seemed to see professionalismand diversity as being at odds with each other, which relates to theexplaining away of diversity among professionals as an issue.However, when it came to actual appointments, minority and ma-jority professionals –executives and non-executives – pointed to factorsother than official criteria for professional competence. They identifiedas crucial “who fits in with the team” and “experiencing a click,” as, forexample, a majority executive explained:There has to be a special connection felt […] if you don’t have thispersonality, you won’t fit in the team.A majority executive recounted how a majority, long-time employeecame to her, frustrated, because she had heard that a minority internwas given a position. The executive asked the majority employee if shefound the intern’s performance lacking. She answered, “No ... she is notincompetent, she is just ... different.” Majority executives discussedcases of “equal performance or qualification” – “in that case you choosethe one you feel best fits the team.” This indicated a consideration ofimplicit criteria concerning emotional and social aspects beyond orsometimes more important than competency, as well as specific ideas ofwhat good professionals were and what they should look like.With these norms of professionalism professionals not only ex-plained away but declared diversity among professionals an invalidissue. This happened when majority and minority professionals pre-sented the click or the fit as being based on personality and involvingindividual difference unrelated to cultural difference or group identity.Minority professionals justified the importance of such “normal differ-ences” of attitude and personal or communicative style at work; as onesaid:You have to have a specific mindset to be able to function in thisteam … to do this kind of work.Similarly, a majority executive reacted to a researcher’s questionabout why a certain minority professional was let go: “Oh, but that ispersonality. You have to fit in of course!” A white, minority executivesaid that, to “treat every professional equally,” he did not look at “ir-relevant identity factors like culture or gender but at what personalityyou have and if it can be an asset to the team.” Another majority ex-ecutive explained why a minority professional had obtained a trainingposition as follows: “...but that was personality. We don’t discriminateagainst people here!” Although this was one of the few times the issueof discrimination was mentioned, most majority executives seemed towant to defend the fairness of their selection practices. In one team,tensions between two “black” professionals and the rest of the teamwere labeled as “just not functioning properly” and “complicated per-sons.” Thus, these tensions were portrayed as not being related tocultural diversity issues; such tensions did not affect the executive’sperception of the team (culture) as open and accepting toward diversityH. Leyerzapf et al. Scandinavian Journal of Management 34 (2018) 141–150146or the general characterization of diversity as positive and un-complicated. Even in a ward known in the hospital and by its ownmembers as an exemplary “well-functioning multicultural team,” pro-fessionalism and diversity were disconnected and professionalism wasidentified as the only thing that mattered as diversity among the teamwas dealt with by highlighting individual differences other than cul-tural identity. Like one majority team member said:We are all so different that it is just … normal!Thus, the process in which cultural diversity issues were declaredinvalid in relation to professionals and work floor practice was based onstrong ideas about what “a professional” is, agreement that “we allshould (want to) be one,” and norms regarding who is suited to be aprofessional or who matches the image, as well as presenting pro-fessionalism, competency and quality as neutral and objective criteria.These ideas and norms became normalized by the obscuring, explainingaway and silencing of diversity issues, with words such as “just” and “ofcourse” signaling that the status quo was, and should be, taken forgranted. Furthermore, these norms were normalized by framing cul-tural diversity issues among professionals as being about personalityand personal, individual difference instead of on group identity, andthus independent from social, societal, political – that is, collective –relations, contexts, and structures.4.4. A normalized social hierarchy: privilege and disadvantage forprofessionals?Though the dominant narrative was that cultural diversity was notan issue, participants’ accounts and practices indicated an alternativenarrative in which cultural diversity was an important aspect in relationto establishing one’s professionalism. Most examples, given by bothmajority and minority professionals, about people not really qualifyingas good professionals or as good professional fits for the team wereabout minority professionals. Being a minority seemed – implicitly –identified as not fitting, as being different from or even at odds with thenorms of professionalism. Majority professionals generally did notdiscuss other majority professionals. They seemed to view the norms ofprofessionalism as matching themselves: they described examples of “anon-fit” as “having a foreign/different/strange accent,” or plainly saidthat “people with a minority background often do not display an as-sertive, open, direct communicative style.” Minority professionals wereto some extent aware of the need to live up to the norms, to prove theyfit in, and of the hierarchical dynamic involved. This was seen, forexample, in a minority participant’s comment about a fellow minoritycolleague who wanted to discuss feelings of exclusion or discrimination:It’s not professional to let yourself be affected by this or let yourwork of delivering care be affected by it. It’s not functional.This representation of the connection between cultural diversity andprofessionalism pointed to a – potential – hierarchy between those whofit the norms and those who do not. This hierarchy appeared linked toselective privilege and disadvantage among professionals, as was illu-strated by the case of a male, minority physician-in-training. Severalmajority and minority colleagues mentioned this person as an ex-emplary “good professional.” However, upon obtaining his specialistdegree, he organized drinks without serving alcohol, which was metwith incomprehension and disappointment by his majority colleagues.As they recounted the situation, it became clear that, by not servingalcohol, he suddenly stopped fitting in and meeting the norms. As oneof them said:We had expected different from him! ... We were surprised anddidn’t understand this. ... He had been so nice all the time and then… this.The majority professionals not only changed their personal opinionof him but perceived what happened as breaking with a dominantworkplace norm (drinks with alcohol), and this discredited his pro-fessionalism.Thus, the workplace was presented by majority and minority par-ticipants as neutral in the sense that there were no diversity issues atstake and selection happened on supposedly factual and objective as-pects such as competence and individual character. However, it alsoinvolved the normalization of majority professionals’ physical, socialand/or cultural characteristics as constituting the image of the goodprofessional and of minority professionals as differing from thosenorms, as well as a hierarchical ordering between the two groups. Amajority specialist expressed this by using “always” and “of course” andseeing the group as the normal standard to which the minority is thedeviant:The minority should, of course, always adapt to the group.The route to successfully qualifying as a professional therefore re-quired identifying and being identified as normal instead of as cultu-rally different. Although minority professionals generally seemed moreat risk of not qualifying and being disadvantaged, while majorityseemed to qualify more easily and hence were privileged, all partici-pants engaged in these normalization practices – thus upholding thenormalization and the potential selective privileging among them.5. DiscussionOur findings showed how cultural diversity among professionalswas narrated as a nonissue, explained away as irrelevant, celebrated asnice and uncomplicated (Ahmed, 2007), or addressed in an instru-mental way as being useful only in dealing with difficult or minoritypatients. Thus, cultural diversity issues such as minority professionals’experiences of exclusion were obscured. Furthermore, cultural diversityissues were declared invalid in a work context by presenting pro-fessionalism as unrelated to or even adversely related to and in-compatible with cultural identity. Because professionalism, and de-termining whether someone qualifies as professional, was representedas neutral, objective, rational, context-less, and individual, all differ-ences between professionals became individualized and labeled asvariations in personality characteristics. However, strong ideas existedon what constitutes a good professional and who fits the norms. Pro-fessionals were thus identified as either normal or different, whichcreated a hierarchy between professionals that was subsequently nor-malized by the dominant narrative on diversity and professionalism.Thus, cultural diversity was stripped of its structural situatedness andseen as individual, apolitical and independent from social hierarchiesand power dynamics. Therefore, normalization of the selective dis-tribution of privilege and disadvantage (i.e., inequity among profes-sionals within the organization) could not be challenged.We will now look more closely at how normalization practices tookplace and how they connect with the concept of the ideal worker norm.We discuss the reproduction of the unequal distribution of privilege anddisadvantage as well as the process that prevents this distribution frombeing addressed. Subsequently, we will discuss contextual aspects andthe meaning of our findings on normalization for critical diversitytheory and future studies.5.1. Normalization of the ideal worker normOur study showed how normalization happened through down-playing cultural diversity by framing it as being about patients only. Forthe professionals, difference was emphasized as something “we all haveor are,” that is, cultural diversity was relegated to individual difference.Framing took place via emphasizing the “positive,” the nice and un-complicated aspects of cultural diversity, such as food and festivities,while downplaying the “negative,” such as minority professionals’ ex-periences with exclusion, and reframing these as unintentional ormisunderstood. Normalization was further enacted through the framingH. Leyerzapf et al. Scandinavian Journal of Management 34 (2018) 141–150147of professionalism as neutral. Qualification as a good professional wasemphasized as being based on objective and rational factors. And dif-ferentiation between professionals was presented as being based onpersonality differences only, while the importance of emotional, social,and cultural connection between professionals was downplayed.Particular language use such as the expressions “of course,” “just,”“always,” and “normal” added to the normalization of these narrativeson cultural diversity. These discursive practices represented a dominantnarrative that cultural diversity as well as social and political issues ofminority inclusion and equality are not at stake in the workplace (seealso Ahmed, 2007). Through the enactment of these practices, profes-sionals disciplined themselves and each other into adopting this nar-rative, hence the narrative became reproduced as well as normalized(Foucault, 1989, 1982).However, in an alternative narrative, cultural diversity was at stake.Cultural diversity was incorporated into professionalism norms re-garding who qualified as professional and what constituted normalityand difference (e.g., no headscarf vs. a headscarf, respectively). Theseexclusivist norms played a role in professionals’ inclusion. The alter-native and dominant narratives both informed each other. The domi-nant narrative veiled the existence of the alternative narrative in ev-eryday interactions by disarming its logic, countering that we are all thesame and emphasizing that cultural diversity is not relevant becauseprofessionalism is the only thing that matters. The alternative narrativereinforced the dominant narrative by normalizing its logic, narratingthat we are not all the same as those that are – seen as – belonging to aminority culture, ethnicity/race, or religion may not be able to fit thenorms and may be less or unprofessional. Together the discursive en-actment of these narratives normalized the idea that professionals areall measured against exclusivist norms regarding cultural sameness anddifference. This, however, is not an equitable process for majority andminority professionals.Besides the formal, official criteria on professionalism (the skills andcompetencies of the dominant narrative), implicit criteria, that is normson professionalism existed (the “good professional” of the alternativenarrative). Adding conceptualizations of the ideal worker in our ana-lysis helped reveal the potential effects of these exclusivist norms in theacademic hospital workplace and show how they translated into pri-vilege or disadvantage for professionals. Originating in the field ofgender diversity, the norm of the ideal worker – often seen as dominantethnicity, white, middle/higher social class, fit, heterosexual, youngand male –affects careers differently depending on the professionals’socially and personally acknowledged (dis)similarity with this organi-zational prototype (Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013; Van den Brink &Benschop, 2011). This ideal seems particularly at play in academichealthcare because of existing tendencies for homogenization, uni-formity, and conformity to “fit into the white coat,” which are sup-ported by professional claims on neutrality and objectivity and, hence,scientific legitimacy and status (Beagan, 2000; Wear, 1997). Essed(2005) calls this a “cloning process.” The existing pressure to fit thenorm of a particular kind of professional and the subsequent normal-ization process are strongly present here and are built on patriarchal,individualistic, principles-based components and a division betweenthe patient as “the Other” and the professional as “the Self” (Bleakley,2013; Wear & Aultman, 2006).Indeed, the ideal worker norm in our study seemed to correspondwith majority norms in which both majority and minority professionalswere engaged. Majority professionals fitted in more easily than theirminority colleagues. This agrees with earlier studies in the academichospital that indicated that minority professionals have to provethemselves against a standard image of a professional that is based onmajority norms and risk standing out in a negative way (Leyerzapf &Abma, 2017; Leyerzapf et al., 2015; Verdonk et al., 2015; Leyerzapfet al., 2018; Van den Broek, 2014). Our findings showed how implicitpower worked and was dispersed in the norms, culture, narratives, anddiscursive practices of this setting, thus making it “invisibly” (re)produced by all and difficult to circumvent (Foucault, 1989, 1982).5.2. Understanding a structural hierarchy between difference and samenessNormalization was enacted by professionals in different ways,yet all included a reification of difference and sameness. Difference wasreified as either a problem concerning – difficult – minority patients oras nice addition (being “multicultural”/minority food or festive tradi-tions) and a useful tool (minority professionals as cultural interpreters)but not primary to the work practice. Sameness was reified in pro-fessionalism as the normal, natural Self and equated with all (assumed)majority professionals and the norm worker ideal from which all (as-sumed) minority professionals deviated. The reification of differenceand sameness was based on a simplistic understanding of cultural di-versity in which difference was equated with minority workers, or those“culturally diverse,” and constituted a static, essentialized culturalOther inherently different from the “normal” Dutch Self (i.e., thosequalifying as same). Thus, the reification of difference and samenessspringing from the limited understanding of cultural diversity impliednot only a dichotomy but also a hierarchical ordering of professionals atthe workplace (Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013; Ghorashi et al., 2015; Nkomo& Cox, 1996; Ostendorp & Steyaert, 2009; Zanoni et al., 2010). As thisfundamental hierarchy formed the core of being (considered) profes-sional, professionals had little space to criticize it or its consequencesand, moreover, worked to normalize and reproduce it.5.3. Professionalism in academic healthcare and equality-as-samenessThe normalization we saw is supported by international discourseson professionalism in academic medicine that focus on attitudes andbehaviors “that can be taught, modeled and evaluated” (Wear &Aultman, 2006, vii), and by discourses in healthcare and society ingeneral that put predominant value on assessment and evaluation(Kipnis, 2008). Internationally, professionalism holds its dominant po-sition because of its conceptual vagueness and legitimized claim toneutrality and objective truth (Van den Brink & Benschop, 2011). Inacademic healthcare, professionalism constitutes something that can bemanaged and controlled as neutrally objective, rational, and apolitical,but it has inherent associations with masculinity and individualistic,principles-based thinking that excludes doubt and uncertainty (Beagan,2000; Bleakley, 2013; Taylor, 2003). However, this professionalism-as-neutral can have very real exclusionary outcomes (Razack, Maguire,Hodges, & Steinert, 2012; Wear & Aultman, 2006).A further contextual aspect that supported the normalization ourstudy found is the strong norm of equality as constituting cultural sa-meness in Dutch organizations and Dutch society in general (Essed,2002; Ghorashi & Sabelis, 2013; Van den Broek, 2014). It stems fromthe sociopolitical ideal of equality in the Netherlands and a firm beliefin Dutch society as democratic and meritocratic (Essed & Hoving, 2014;Van den Broek, 2014). According to Ghorashi (2014), however, dif-ference is tolerated as long as appearance and conduct are “same” anddo not challenge the status quo (“passive tolerance”). Recent discourseson Dutch superiority over Others – especially non-Western Others and,in particular, assumed Muslims – seem to involve the normalization ofracist expressions in society, because the dominant normativity ofequality-as-sameness prevents racism from being acknowledged as areal social pattern (Essed & Hoving, 2014; Essed & Trienekens, 2008;Wekker, 2016). Similar mechanisms for normalization practices may bepresent in other northwestern European countries as well: the pro-fessionalism rhetoric is internationally established, and studies incountries such as the UK and Sweden indicate existing ideologies ofequality-as-sameness, albeit in the contexts of sexual and gender di-versity, respectively (Söderberg & Nyhlén, 2014; Willis, Maegusuku-Hewett, Raithby, ö Miles, 2014).H. Leyerzapf et al. Scandinavian Journal of Management 34 (2018) 141–1501485.4. Strengths and limitationsInterviews and participant observations provided a dynamic un-derstanding of how issues were enacted in everyday interactions. Theyenabled critical awareness of the multiple roles of participants inpracticing normalization, as well as that of the researchers in “steppinginto,” questioning and writing about these workplace realities. Theresearch and the researchers’ presence on the wards surely affected howparticipants dealt with diversity. Because our study involved naminginvisible interactions and experiences and exploring sensitive topics,such as the – possible – exclusion of employees, confidentiality was anissue throughout the research. This study was limited by privacy con-cerns (for the participants and the participating wards), which pre-vented us from providing detailed reflections on context and on – dif-ferences in – participants’ positionings and (self-) identifications.Furthermore, this study also confronted the researchers with the issueof (their own) whiteness in research (Chadderton, 2012). As a whiteconducting researcher, it proved difficult to address reports and ob-servations of exclusionary, racist interactions without confirming thehierarchical reification of difference and sameness and thus adding tothe normalization taking place, while also trying not to compromise theresearch.5.5. Normalization in relation to critical diversity theory and futureresearchOur findings make clear that future research and projects directed atchange toward inclusion of diversity in organizations should focus onthe unsettling of normalization as this is the core of the praxis of in-clusion/exclusion. Earlier studies have advocated for critically addres-sing normalization (Ahmed, 2007; DiAngelo, 2011; Fletcher, 1999; Vanden Broek, 2014; Wear ö Bickel, 2009; Wear, 1997). Our study showedhow normalization is at play and is enacted in situations where there isa disconnect between “talking” diversity and “doing diversity” and thatare perceived as unsettling for the organizational status quo. By ana-lyzing the empirical praxis of normalization, our study illustrated hownormalization practices constitute an active performance of “unseeing”social hierarchies and unequal distribution of privilege and dis-advantage and its impact on – minority – professionals at work. Theynot only entailed a covering up of the power imbalances in professionalworkplace norms, but also ‘deactivated’ the – potential – arguments andmotivations to address inclusion/exclusion and the need to strive for amore inclusive and equitable workplace culture by declaring these ar-guments and motivations as invalid. Other critical diversity studiesstressed how agency of minority professionals is inherently ambiguousand contentious as they need to “manoeuvre” discursive spaces ofpower and make “trade-offs” between identity, career and social change(Van Laer ö Janssens, 2011, 2014, 2017), and how majority profes-sionals are crucial in normalizing differences and broadening compe-tency norms to establish equality, especially in larger, hierarchical or-ganizations (Janssens ö Zanoni, 2014) – such as in this case theacademic hospital. We share the emphasis these studies put on theburdening experience of exclusion of minority and the need for ma-jority leaders to further organizational change, however, we believestructural practice change requires an integral starting point that fo-cuses on the restraint on agency of both minority and majority due tonormalization.With our study, we have shown how majority and minority pro-fessionals are all “complicit” in normalization and dealing with in-equalities is hence not a matter of redistribution of quantifiable privi-lege/disadvantage but about a certain quality of social relations.Unsettling normalization, i.e. “re-seeing” inequalities and “re-enfor-cing” the performativity of diversity management, can only happenwhen all involved first of all recognize and acknowledge their sharedparticipation and interdependence in power structures, and subse-quently practice shared responsibility in the process of change (Medina,2013). We build on the existing critical diversity theory by researchingthe specific, namely traditionally hierarchical, context of the academichospital workplace, and illustrating how here the agentic potential ofminority professionals or those relatively disadvantaged is bound withthat of majority professionals or those relatively privileged and thatthey therefore have to work together to challenge social hierarchies andenable transformation. To unsettle normalization, redress power im-balances and make academic healthcare structurally inclusive andequitable, professionals in the hospital need to engage in critical andreflexive “courageous conversations” (Acosta ö Ackerman-Barger,2017) to rethink professionalism norms, thereby explicitly addressingtacit sources of inequality and exclusion.To consolidate theory on normalization from a critical, discursivepower perspective, we suggest further empirical research in otheracademic and peripheral hospitals in urban and rural areas within theNetherlands and internationally. Discussions of the parallels and dif-ferences in health professionals’ narratives and experiences of diversitylinked to intersecting identity characteristics other than race, ethnicity,religion, and culture, were beyond the scope of this paper. New re-search should use an intersectional approach that works from cultural/ethnic/racial diversity but also involves aspects such as gender andsocial class, and discusses their joint roles in normalization and theunequal distribution of privilege and disadvantage. Research in dif-ferent geographical, professional, social, and political contexts couldinvestigate how ideologies of sameness, exclusivist discourses, andwhite privilege are contextually related to normalization (DiAngelo,2011; Leyerzapf et al., 2015; Verdonk et al., 2015; Wekker, 2016).Critical reflexivity about – normalization of – whiteness in researchsettings and among the researchers should be part of such studies(Chadderton, 2012).Conflicts of interestAll authors declare they have no conflicts of interest.FundingThe study on which this paper reports received funding from theNational Scientific Funding Agency of the Netherlands in the form ofthe Aspasia grant.

    "abstract": "Internationally, academic hospitals are giving increasing attention to diversity management. This paper sheds light on the actual praxis of cultural diversity management by professionals in workplace interactions. An ethnographic study in a Dutch academic hospital showed that normalization practices were obscuring diversity issues and obstructing inclusion of cultural minority professionals. The normalization of professionalism-as-neutral and equality-as-sameness informed the unequal distribution of privilege and disadvantage among professionals and left no room to question this distribution. Majority and minority professionals disciplined themselves and each other in (re)producing an ideal worker norm, essentialized difference and sameness, and explained away the structural hierarchy involved. To create space for cultural diversity in healthcare organizations in the Netherlands and beyond, we need to challenge normalization practices.</p",
