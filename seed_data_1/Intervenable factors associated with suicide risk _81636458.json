Bauer1*, Ayden I. Scheim1, Jake Pyne2, Robb Travers3 and Rebecca Hammond4Abstract\nBackground: Across Europe, Canada, and the United States, 22–43 % of transgender (trans) people report a history\nof suicide attempts. We aimed to identify intervenable factors (related to social inclusion, transphobia, or sex/\ngender transition) associated with reduced risk of past-year suicide ideation or attempt, and to quantify the potential\npopulation health impact.\nMethods: The Trans PULSE respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey collected data from trans people age 16+ in\nOntario, Canada, including 380 who reported on suicide outcomes. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic\nregression models were weighted using RDS II methods. Counterfactual risk ratios and population attributable\nrisks were estimated using model-standardized risks.\nResults: Among trans Ontarians, 35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) seriously considered, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4)\nattempted, suicide in the past year. Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identification\ndocuments changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in\nsuicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). Parental\nsupport for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th versus 90th\npercentile) was associated with a 66 % reduction in ideation (RR = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67), and an additional\n76 % reduction in attempts among those with ideation (RR = 0.24; 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.82). This corresponds to potential\nprevention of 160 ideations per 1000 trans persons, and 200 attempts per 1,000 with ideation, based on a hypothetical\nreduction of transphobia from current levels to the 10th percentile.\nConclusions: Large effect sizes were observed for this controlled analysis of intervenable factors, suggesting that\ninterventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the\npotential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts\nwithin trans populations. Such interventions at the population level may require policy change.\nKeywords: Social exclusion, Transgender, Transsexual, Suicide, Suicidal behaviour, Social determinants of health,\nTransphobia* Correspondence: greta.bauer@schulich.uwo.ca\n1Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, The\nUniversity of Western Ontario, London, Canada\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2015 Bauer et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 2 of 15Background\nTrans (transgender or transsexual) people, who may repre-\nsent up to 0.5 % of the adult population [1], have an ex-\ntremely high prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts.\nStudies in Canada, Europe, and the United States have\nreported suicide attempt prevalences within the trans popu-\nlation that range from 22 to 43 % over the lifetime and 9 to\n10 % for the past year [2–7]. In contrast, 3.7 % of all Can\nadians had seriously considered [8], and 0.6 % attempted\n[9], suicide in the past year. While completed suicide rates\namong trans people are unknown [10], a history of\nattempted suicide is the strongest predictor of completed\nsuicide across multiple populations [11]. Demographic fac-\ntors predictive of suicide attempts in the Canadian popula-\ntion overall include female sex, youth, chronic illness, lack\nof religiosity, and being unmarried [9]. These predictors\nmay not hold within trans populations; for instance, among\ntrans Ontarians, ideation and attempts did not differ by\ngender identity [2]. Moreover, while identification of demo-\ngraphic risk factors is helpful for targeting interventions,\nthey are largely non-modifiable. There is an urgent need to\nidentify intervenable risk and protective factors [12].\nTo date, most trans suicide research has been descrip-\ntive, or has assessed predictors of any lifetime suicide at-\ntempts [6, 7, 13]. This limits applicability of results to\nsuicide prevention, because predictors of lifetime versus\nrecent suicide risk, and of ideation versus attempts, may\ndiffer. Other studies have focused on patients seeking care\nfor medical transition [14, 15], who are not representative\nof the entire trans population [16]. Recent longitudinal\nstudies demonstrate reductions in psychological distress\nfollowing medical transition [17, 18]. Therefore, barriers\nto accessing transition-related care [19] may contribute to\nincreased suicide ideation and attempts. However, among\nthose who have had hormonal treatment and/or sex re-\nassignment surgery, suicide attempts and deaths remain\nelevated relative to the broader population [15, 20]. Thus,\nit appears that factors other than gender dysphoria (dis-\ntress or discomfort with one’s natal sex) contribute to in-\ncreased suicide risk in trans populations.\nWhile not all trans people experience profound dis-\ntress regarding their embodiment, they nearly universally\nreport some degree of social exclusion and transphobia\n[21]. Trans people are subjected to invisibility in institu-\ntional settings [22], high levels of discrimination and re-\njection [21, 23], harassment and violence [24–26], and\npoverty [7, 27]. Trans-related social exclusion has been\nassociated with increased lifetime and past-year suicide\nattempts [2, 6, 28], while social and family support appear\nto be protective [2, 29]. Determinants of suicide risk in the\nbroader population, including depression, substance mis-\nuse, and poverty [9, 10] are also elevated among trans per-\nsons [6, 30, 31], but are consistently attributed to social\nexclusion and victimization [23, 25, 28, 32, 33]. Socialexclusion, victimization, and trauma have been identified\nas key contributors to suicide disparities across marginal-\nized populations, including sexual minorities [34–38] and\nIndigenous peoples [38–41].\nThe current study sought to identify intervenable so-\ncial factors associated with suicide risk reduction for\ntrans people.\nTheoretical model\nWe present a conceptual model (Fig. 1) for two outcomes:\npast-year serious consideration of suicide, and – among\nthose considering – past-year attempt. This approach\nreflected the possibility that factors impacting ideation\nand attempts may differ, as well as the pragmatic desire to\nboth prevent suicidal ideation and to inform crisis inter-\nventions among those who are suicidal.\nVariables were included as socio-demographic or back-\nground factors for the following reasons: 1) they are not\namenable to change through intervention in our study\npopulation, either because they are unchangeable or be-\ncause they occurred prior to age 16; 2) they are unlikely\nto be a result of the intervenable factors in the model,\nand 3) they are known or hypothesized to be associated\nwith suicide ideation or attempts. Background factors\nmust be controlled for as confounders in order to ex-\nplore the impact of intervenable factors, so that differ-\nences observed for other factors are not based simply on\ndifferences in socio-demographic composition, illness, or\nhistory of childhood abuse.\nVariables representing modifiable factors that may be\ntargeted by potential interventions for suicide prevention\nwithin trans populations fell within three major con-\nstructs: social inclusion, transphobia (including enacted\nand internalized stigma, as well as violent victimization),\nand sex/gender transition. Their roles reflect minority\nstress [42], as they represent discrimination or accept-\nance, inclusion or exclusion, and barriers to full social\nparticipation. Moreover, all thirteen intervenable factors\nare social or medical determinants of health that are poten-\ntially intervenable through policy, social and/or medical\nintervention, but suggest different strategies. Thus, they are\nconsidered individually in this analysis rather than as over-\nall constructs. For example, within the construct of social\ninclusion, interventions designed to increase parental sup-\nport for gender identity or expression (e.g., family therapy,\nsocial media campaigns) would differ from those to in-\ncrease identity document concordance (e.g., policy change\non requirements for sex designation changes (or re-\nmoval of sex designations altogether) at the federal and\nstate/provincial levels).\nInterventions on these factors have the potential to\nimpact suicide ideation and attempts through multiple\npathways. Suicide researchers have proposed models of\nsuicidal behaviour, which focus on proximal determinants\nFig. 1 Conceptual model of intervenable social inclusion, transphobia and transition-related factors for suicide prevention among transgender\npeople in Ontario, Canada\nBauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 3 of 15of ideation and attempts. Prominent among them is\nJoiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide [43, 44], which ac-\ncounts for a wide range of known risk factors for suicidal\nbehaviour via three primary constructs. Suicide ideation is\nattributed to thwarted belongingness (resulting from so-\ncial isolation) and perceived burdensomeness (e.g., result-\ning from family conflict or illness), and acquired capability\nis required for suicidal ideation to engender suicidal intent\nand attempts. The capability to overcome the natural dis-\ninclination to physical pain and death is acquired through\nprevious exposure to fear and/or pain. Distal factors are\nposited to increase suicide risk by contributing to these\nproximal constructs [44]. Such distal factors are the focus\nof our analysis, but we include proximal factors in Fig. 1\nto explicate this conceptualization. Similarly, given the fre-\nquency of transphobic experiences [21] and their pro-\nfound effects on depression [30–32], housing [45], and\naccess to services [22], we also included most of the vari-\nables traditionally defined as psychosocial risk factors as\nproximal factors. Together, these may mediate the effectsof transphobia and other intervenable variables on idea-\ntion and/or attempts through a multitude of possible\npathways that may be explored in future research.\nMethods\nStudy sample\nData were collected via respondent-driven sampling\n(RDS) in 2009–2010 as part of the Trans PULSE Project,\na community-based research study in Ontario, Canada’s\nmost populous province. To be eligible, participants had\nto live, work or receive health care in Ontario, be age 16\nor over, and identify as trans, broadly defined. Partici-\npants held a range of gender identities and were not re-\nquired to have begun a social or medical sex/gender\ntransition.\nRDS is a method that combines systematic chain-referral\nsampling with statistical analysis strategies that account\nfor differential levels of connectedness as well as non-\nindependence within recruitment chains. This method\nwas chosen as trans persons in Ontario were at least\nBauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 4 of 15moderately networked, either in person or electronic-\nally, but constituted a hidden population that could not\nbe randomly sampled. Moreover, given the lack of data\non trans people, there was community motivation to\nparticipate, including to recruit others. Sampling began\nwith 16 initial seeds, with 22 additional seeds enrolled\nonce it was certain that sufficient recruitment chain\nlength could be obtained. Each participant could recruit\nadditional participants using a tracked coupon system,\nwherein three coupons were issued to each participant\nfor distribution to eligible individuals. This allowed the re-\nsearch team to identify the network structure (i.e., who re-\ncruited whom) while allowing participants to remain\nanonymous if desired. Data collection continued for one\nyear (n = 433), with a maximum chain length of ten waves.\nA network diagram of the sample is presented in Fig. 2.\nOur analysis is based on 380 participants (87.8 %) who\ncompleted items on past-year suicide ideation and\nattempts. Ethics approval for the project was provided\nby Research Ethics Boards at The University of Western\nOntario and Wilfrid Laurier University.\nSurvey and measures\nMeasures were derived from self-report data collected\nthrough a multi-mode survey (with visually identical online\nor paper versions), which could be completed anonymouslyFig. 2 Network diagram of sample of trans people in Ontario, Canada (n =\nindividuals.

The survey was pre-\ntested by 16 members of the project’s Community Engage-\nment Team for content validity, clarity and length. A copy\nof the survey is available online (http://transpulsepro-\nject.ca/resources/trans-pulse-survey/).\nOutcomes\nPast-year suicidal ideation was coded from items that\nasked participants “Have you ever seriously considered\ncommitting suicide or taking your own life?” and “If yes,\nhas this happened in the past 12 months?” Similar\nfollow-up questions for those who indicated ideation\nasked “Have you ever attempted to commit suicide or\ntried taking your own life?” and “If yes, did this happen\nin the past 12 months?”\nBackground variables\nAge, disability status, parental status, and chronic illness/\npain were indicated by participant self-report. Gender\nspectrum was coded into two categories that each rep-\nresent a spectrum of identities. Female-to-male spec-\ntrum individuals were those assigned female at birth, but\nwho now identify as men or another non-female identity\n(e.g., genderqueer, bigender); similarly, male-to-female\nspectrum participants were those assigned male at birth\nwho now identify as women, trans girls, two-spirit, or other433). Circles = male-to-female (MTF) spectrum, including genderqueer\neer individuals. Grey = no past-year serious consideration of suicide.\nt-year suicide attempt(s)\nBauer et al.

Gender fluidity was coded as a separate\ndichotomous measure from a check-all-that-apply identity\nitem into two categories: holding a more conventional gen-\nder identity (male or primarily masculine, female or primar-\nily feminine), or only gender-fluid or third-gender identities.\nEthno-racial group was comprised of three groups: partici-\npants were grouped as Aboriginal if they indicated they\nwere First Nations, Métis, or Inuit, or another Indigenous\nethnicity; non-Aboriginal participants were classified as\nwhite or racialized based on an ethno-racial background\nitem, a write-in question describing background, and indica-\ntion as to whether or not they were perceived by others as a\nperson of colour. In Ontario, the term “racialized” is pre-\nferred over racial minority, visible minority, person of colour\nor non-White as it expresses race as a social construct ra-\nther than a description on perceived biological traits” [46].\nImmigration history was approximated by self-report of\nwhether the participant was born in Canada. Sexual orienta-\ntion was coded as sexual minority based on either identifica-\ntion as gay, lesbian or bisexual/pansexual, or having a past-\nyear sex partner of the same gender. Region of province was\nclassified based on first letter of postal code. Strong religious\nupbringing was defined as responding “quite” or “extremely”\nto the question “How religious or faith-based was your up-\nbringing?” Childhood abuse prior to age 16 was indicated in\ntwo items describing physical and sexual abuse experiences.\nMajor mental health disorders were coded using a self-\nreported checklist based on any prior diagnosis (e.g., bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder).\nDepression and anxiety disorders were excluded, as they are\nmore likely to result from intervenable factors under study,\nand we hypothesized they would partially mediate their ef-\nfects on suicide ideation or attempt; if we were to control\nfor these mediators we would then remove a portion of the\ncausal effect and would produce estimates for the effects of\nour intervenable factors as enacted only through pathways\nother than depression or anxiety.\nIntervenable variables – social inclusion\nSocial support was assessed using the 19-item Medical\nOutcomes Study Social Support Scale [47]. Items were\naveraged, with possible scale values from 1 to 5 (Cron-\nbach α = 0.97). Strong support for gender was coded for\nparticipants’ parents by combining self-report of either\n“very strong” support for gender identity or expression\nexperienced from a parent or parents, or (for those who\nwere not out to their parents) self-report of expectation\nof such support. Other gender support variables were\nsimilarly coded. “Peers” averaged completed items on\nfriends, co-workers, or classmates, and “Leaders” on\nschools, teachers, supervisors or employers. Current re-\nligiosity or spirituality was measured on a 6-point Likert\nscale ranging from “not at all” to “extremely”. Having\none or more identity documents concordant with livedgender was coded for the participant sub-group who had\nsocially transitioned and lived full-time in a male/masculine\nor female/feminine gender, based on having at least one\ndocument with a sex/gender designation (“M” or “F”)\nmatching one’s lived gender. Identity documents included\nfederal and provincial identification (e.g. drivers license,\npassport, Indian Status card, military ID).\nIntervenable variables –transphobia\nTransphobia was assessed using an 11-item scale [21]; it\nincluded items on enacted and internalized stigma as\nwell as victimization, such as police harassment or feel-\ning that being trans hurt or embarrassed one’s family.\nItems were summed, with possible values ranging from\n0 to 33 (Cronbach α = 0.81). Transphobic harassment\nand violence was defined as self-report of physical or\nsexual assault for being trans (analogous to assault as a\nhate crime); report of verbal harassment or threats re-\nlated to being trans, but not of assault; and report of\nnone of these.\nIntervenable variables –transition\nMedical transition status was self-reported as having\ncompleted a medical transition (self-defined), being in\nthe process, planning to transition but not yet having\nbegun, and either not planning, being unsure, or indicat-\ning that the concept of “transition” did not apply. Com-\npleting a medical transition involved varying hormone\nand/or surgical treatments [16]. Hormone use was self-\nreported. Social transition status was coded as living in\none’s felt gender full-time, part-time, or not at all. Being\nperceived as cisgender (non-trans) was coded for those\nliving full-time in a non-fluid gender, based on a survey\nitem that asked how often others knew you were trans\nwithout being told.\nStatistical analysis\nSince eligible trans persons who knew fewer potential\nparticipants were less likely to be sampled than those\nwith large network sizes, RDS II weights [48] were cal-\nculated based on the inverse of each participant’s degree\n(personal network size), rescaled to sum to the total\nsample size of 433. This approach has been shown to\nproduce frequency estimates that are asymptotically un-\nbiased [49]. Here weighted statistics can be interpreted\nto apply to the population of networked (know at least\none other eligible person) trans people age 16 and over\nin Ontario. All analyses were weighted, and adjusted for clus-\ntering by shared recruiter to account for non-independence\nwithin recruitment chains. Weighted frequencies or means,\nalong with 95 % confidence intervals, were calculated for all\nbackground and potential intervention variables using SAS\nversion 9.3 [50].\nBauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 6 of 15Prior to regression, simple imputation was used for\nbackground variables to reduce data loss in a complete\ncase analysis. Of 380 participants with outcome data, 30\nwere missing data for one background covariate and 5\nfor more than one.\nMultivariable logistic regression models were fitted for\neach intervenable factor variable separately, controlling\nfor all background variables, using SAS-callable SUDAAN\nversion 11.0 [51]. Thus, 13 logistic regression models were\nfitted for the 13 intervenable factor variables for the sui-\ncidal ideation outcome, and an additional 13 models for\nthe suicide attempt outcome; all models similarly con-\ntrolled for background variables, but not for other inter-\nvenable variables, as mediated pathways between these\nvariables are unknown. A domain analysis was used in\norder to limit the second analysis to the sample subgroup\nwith suicidal ideation.\nAll categorical variables were dummy-coded to allow for\nindependent estimation of effects for each group. Refer-\nence categories were chosen so that contrasts reflected ef-\nfects in the direction of desired potential intervention\neffects (e.g., protecting from assault, increasing social sup-\nport). Continuous variables were entered into the models\nas continuous. Since average marginal risks are estimated\nfor specific points in the distribution (as if the entire trans\npopulation – standardized to the background variables –\nwas at that level), the 10th and 90th percentiles were used\nas points for estimation since participant values did not\nnecessarily cover the range of a scale and the extremes\nmay not be achievable with any intervention (e.g., no\ntransphobia would require not even having heard once\nthat trans people were not normal).\nModel-standardized risks and risk ratios for past-\nyear suicidal ideation and attempts (standardized to\nthe weighted sample or subsample on all background\nfactors) were estimated for each of the thirteen inter-\nvenable variables under the counterfactual conditions\nwhere all participants were exposed or alternately all\nwere unexposed to a dichotomous intervenable factor,\nor to an intervention target and reference level of a\ncategorical factor. For continuous variables, these counter-\nfactual risks were estimated for the 10th and 90th percent-\nile levels. Standardized risks and risk ratios, and their 95 %\nconfidence intervals, were calculated by Graubard and\nKorn’s method [52] using the ADJRR option in SUDAAN\nPROC RLOGIST [51]. Where effects were statistically sig-\nnificant for a variable, counterfactual population attribut-\nable risks (cPARs) were then calculated by taking the\nweighted prevalence of the outcome in the sample (fac-\ntual) and subtracting the model-standardized risk\n(counterfactual) based on having the entire population\nat intervention target levels of the exposure. These rep-\nresent the potential proportion of the trans population\naffected (e.g., outcome averted) under the interventiontarget condition (e.g., all have parental support for gen-\nder). Counterfactual population attributable risk pro-\nportions (c%PARs) were similarly estimated by dividing\ncPAR by the weighted prevalence of the outcome in the\nsample; these represent the proportion of cases poten-\ntially averted within the trans population. C%PARs for\ndifferent variables will sum to more than 100 %, given\nthat a case of ideation or suicide attempt could be pre-\nvented through multiple means.\nResults\nMeans or frequencies for sociodemographics and back-\nground covariates are presented in Table 1. Frequencies\nfor intervenable variables and past-year suicide ideation\nand attempt are presented in Table 2. In the past year,\n35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) had seriously considered sui-\ncide, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4) reported that they\nhad attempted it.\nFindings on model-standardized risks are presented in\nTable 3 for suicide ideation and in Table 4 for suicide at-\ntempts (among those with ideation), along with model-\nstandardized relative risks and population attributable\nrisks. Average relative effects on individuals, and at a\ntrans population level, were sometimes strong. High\nlevels of social support (90th percentile) versus low\nlevels (10th percentile) were significantly associated with\na 49 % reduction in suicide ideation (RR = 0.51; 95 % CI:\n0.28, 0.94), and with a further 82 % reduction in attempt\nrisk among those with ideation (RR = 0.18; 95 % CI: 0.04,\n0.73). This would be associated with potential preven-\ntion of 100 cases of ideation per 1,000 trans persons\n(cPAR = 0.10), and a further prevention of 220 attempts\nper 1,000 trans persons considering suicide (cPAR =\n0.22). Among sources of strong support for gender, only\nsupport from parents was statistically significantly asso-\nciated with reduced risk, with RR = 0.43 (95 % CI: 0.26,\n0.73) for past-year ideation, and no additional statisti-\ncally significant effect on the risk of attempts among\nthose with ideation. At a population level, this corre-\nsponds to potential prevention of 170 trans persons per\n1,000 (cPAR = 0.17) from seriously considering suicide\n(and thus also reducing the risk of attempt through low-\nering the proportion at risk). Interestingly, strong sup-\nport from leaders such as supervisors or teachers was\nsignificantly associated with an increased risk of at-\ntempts among those with ideation (RR = 5.24; 95 % CI:\n2.20, 12.46).

However, among the sub-group\nwith ideation, being in the process of transitioning was\nsignificantly associated with increased risk of an attempt\n(RR = 2.91; 95 % CI: 1.48, 5.76) in comparison with those\nwho were planning to transition but had not yet begun.\nWe did not observe an increased risk in this sub-group\namong those who completed a medical transition (RR =\n0.51; 0.07, 3.74). Completing a medical transition had\nbeneficial individual and population effects. It was asso-\nciated with a 62 % relative risk reduction (RR = 0.38;\n95 % CI: 0.22, 0.66) in ideation. On a trans population\nlevel, to facilitate completion of medical transition\n(when desired) would correspond to preventing 170\ncases of ideation per year per 1,000 trans persons\n(cPAR = 0.17), representing 44 % of ideation (c%PAR =\n0.44), and further preventing 240 attempts per 1,000\nwith ideation (cPAR = 0.24) or 69 % of attempts in this\ngroup (c%PAR = 0.69).\nDiscussion\nOur findings provide evidence that social inclusion (social\nsupport, gender-specific support from parents, identity\ndocuments), protection from transphobia (interpersonal,\nviolence), and undergoing medical transition have the po-\ntential for sizeable effects on the high rates of suicide idea-\ntion and attempts in trans communities. In contrast, we\ndid not find statistically significant effects for social transi-\ntion, gender support from sources other than parents, or\nreligiosity/spirituality, other than an unexpected finding re-\ngarding strong gender support from leaders. Given that stat-\nistical power was not high, as evidenced by the width of our\nconfidence intervals, a lack of statistical significance does\nnot mean that these other factors should be dismissed, as\nsmaller effects may exist below the threshold for detection.\nOur results provide support for the potentially strong im-\npact of trans-specific discrimination or harassment (e.g., ex-\nperiences of transphobia), interpersonal factors (e.g., strong\nparental support for gender identity or expression) and\nstructural factors (e.g., having an identity document with a\ngender marker concordant with one’s lived gender) on sui-\ncide ideation or attempts. This reinforces our earlier de-\nscriptive findings that risk of suicide ideation and attempts\nvaried greatly among trans people [2], and reinforces the\nneed to look beyond proximal determinants toward sites of\nearly prevention or intervention. It is not clear to what\nextent results from this study may also apply to gender\nnon-conforming cisgender persons, but we note that\namong sexual minority youth, early gender non-conformity\nhas been associated with increased suicidal behaviour or\nrisk, a process that may be mediated by gender harassment\nor bullying [53–55], or by parental disapproval of gender\nexpression [55].\nThe large effect sizes observed support the possibility\nfor preventing suicidal ideation and attempts in a largenumber of individuals. Using the transphobia results as\nan example, combining the population effects of a re-\nduction in ideation and a reduction in attempt risk\namong the reduced cases of ideation, and given a popu-\nlation estimate of 53,500 trans adults in Ontario [26], we\nwould estimate that reducing experiences of transphobia\ncould prevent 8,560 trans persons in the province from\nexperiencing suicidal ideation and 4,601 persons from a\nsuicide attempt within a year.\nOur results represent the most detailed analysis of this\nissue to date; our study was based on a respondent-\ndriven sample of trans people from a large provincial\ngeographic area. The analysis takes account of differen-\ntial probability of recruitment related to differences in\nnetwork size, but other biases unrelated to network size\nmay remain [56]. Our use of past-year suicide-related\nmeasures represents an improvement over studies that\nused lifetime measures, as we are able to analyse impact\non recent or current risk, which is most relevant to pre-\nvention. However, temporality remains a concern. It is\npossible that some potential causes occurring in the past\nyear followed rather than preceded the outcome. This is\none potential explanation of the unusual finding of sup-\nport from a leader (teacher, supervisor, institution) being\nassociated with increased suicide attempts among those\nwith ideation, in that an attempt may trigger the involve-\nment of leaders. Moreover, as we were unable to deter-\nmine the exact sequences of events for each participant,\nit is likely that we have partially controlled for some me-\ndiating effects or not controlled for some confounding.\nFor example, borderline personality disorder is adjusted\nfor as a confounder, though it is possible that for some\nparticipants its etiology includes experiences of trans-\nphobia such as those we assess, and it may thus play a\nmediating role. Despite these limitations, we attempted\nto address temporality within a cross-sectional design\nthrough time designations within questionnaire items\n(e.g., childhood abuse prior to the age for inclusion in\nthis study) and use of past-year outcomes.\nOur finding that completing a medical transition was\nassociated with reduced risk has implications for inter-\npretation of existing studies on completed suicides. Be-\ncause trans people are not identifiable in death records,\nand because completed suicides may occur among those\nwho know they are trans but are not known by family\nmembers to be trans, valid studies of completed suicides\nhave only been done where patient records from gender\nclinics have been matched to population death records\n(e.g., in Sweden [15]). Our results suggest these esti-\nmates of completed suicide among those who have med-\nically transitioned likely underestimate the risk of suicide\namong broader trans communities.\nAs all surveys are, by definition, studies of survivors,\nsurvival bias remains an issue. Frequencies for attempts\nBauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 13 of 15will likely be underestimated. Factors that predict lethal-\nity may be missed, if those who completed suicide differ\nfrom those who survived attempts. Given that we\nassessed suicide attempts only among those who indi-\ncated past-year serious consideration, our data may also\nhave missed additional attempts that were impulsive and\nunplanned. Moreover, past-year prevalence may not rep-\nresent a first incident of suicide ideation or attempt;\nthus, this analysis cannot distinguish between factors\nthat lead one to first become suicidal versus to continue\nbeing suicidal.\nProximal factors theorized and demonstrated to in-\ncrease risk of suicide ideation and/or attempts (e.g., risk\nfactors from epidemiological research and interpersonal\nfactors from Joiner’s Interpersonal Model [43]) were\nconceptualized as mediators, but not included in these\nanalyses. Moreover, our analysis could not disaggregate\neffects of intervenable variables on other intervenable\nvariables. For example, it is possible that increased par-\nental support for gender may affect whether or not\nsomeone is able to medically transition; it is also possible\nthat medical transition results in increased parental sup-\nport for gender, as parents are able to more clearly see\ntheir child in their felt gender. These areas represent\nopportunities for future research. In general, suicide\nresearch regarding gender and sexual minorities has\ntended to overlook existing theoretical frameworks\nwithin suicidology [57], though they are not incompat-\nible with other frameworks or methods. Future research\nwith trans populations could draw on interdisciplinary\ntheories as well as evidence from trans-specific and\nbroader population research on suicide ideation and at-\ntempts to study mediated pathways.\nFuture prospective cohort studies of broadly defined\ntrans populations are needed to alleviate many of the\nlimitations of this and other studies. With prospective\ndata, we may be able to differentiate between factors\nthat cause initial ideation and factors that prolong its\nduration, as well as those that lead to first and repeated\nattempts. We could also begin to study completed sui-\ncides in a non-clinical trans population, at least among\nthose who are willing to identify as trans to researchers.\nMoreover, with clear information on temporality, we\nwould be able to design better controlled and more valid\nanalyses, and to examine mediated pathways (including\npathways between intervenable factors as well as prox-\nimal factors) to better understand the process through\nwhich social marginalization may impact suicide ideation\nand attempt.\nOur goal of evaluating intervenable factors should be\ninterpreted as a screening of potential strategies rather\nthan an analysis of actual population intervention effects.\nWhile background factors are structured to represent\nthose that are in the past, unchangeable, or not likely tochange in response to other factors in the model, our ana-\nlytic approach then considers intervenable factors singly;\nit was not possible to tease apart causal pathways among\nthese factors and combining them into one model would\nby default serve to prioritize the proximal causal factors\nwhile reducing the effect sizes of other potentially import-\nant causes [58] (a general effect of multivariable models\nthat is not often explicated but is commonly understood\nwith regard to control for a mediator reducing a causal\neffect [59, 60]). Depending upon inter-individual vari-\nation, as in all individual-level studies, also results in an\ninability to detect simultaneous effects at the group\nlevel [61]. For example, reducing transphobic assaults\nfrom the current prevalence of 21.2 to 0 % may affect\nsuicide risk not only by saving individuals from the\ntrauma of hate-based assault, but may have additional\neffects on these individuals and others based on living\nin a society where transphobic assaults do not occur,\nversus where they are common.\nConclusions\nOur findings support a strong effect for social exclusion,\ndiscrimination and lack of medical transition (for those\nneeding it) on suicide ideation and attempts, and poten-\ntially on the survival of trans persons. This adds support\nto the larger discussion regarding social impacts on sui-\ncide risk in groups experiencing marginalization, such\nas Indigenous communities and sexual minorities. Our\nteam has previously published recommendations for\nsuicide prevention efforts with trans persons, based on\ndescriptive analyses of these data [2]. The present analysis\nprovides stronger support for those recommendations, in-\ncluding attention to social support and protection from\ndiscrimination, by showing that these effects remain after\nadjusting for potential confounding by background. It also\nsuggests additional targets for intervention. Specifically,\nwhile gender recognition is recognized as a human right\nfor trans people in Ontario [62], we have provided the first\nevidence of its potential to reduce suicidality. Since our\ndata were collected, the surgical requirement for changing\nthe sex/gender designation on an Ontario birth certificate\nhas been eliminated. Such legal and policy changes can be\nconsidered public health interventions worthy of longer-\nterm evaluation. In addition, parental support has been\npreviously associated with reduced suicide risk for sexual\nminority [63] and trans [64] youth, but our results demon-\nstrate the importance of parental support for gender iden-\ntity among adults, suggesting a need for all-ages family\ninterventions. Finally, we found that among those report-\ning a need to medically transition through hormones and/\nor surgeries, suicidality was substantially reduced among\nthose who had completed a medical transition (this in-\nvolved varying procedures based on personal needs [16]).\nDespite potentially large reductions in risk for those\nBauer et al. BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:525 Page 14 of 15completing medical transition, the period of being in\nprocess did not represent a clear mid-point in risk. While\nsuicidal ideation was significantly reduced for those in\nprocess versus those who were planning to transition but\nhad not begun, among the sub-group considering suicide\nthe attempt rate was highest among those in process.\nThese results call into question the safety of clinical prac-\ntices that delay transition treatments until depressive\nsymptoms or suicidality are well-controlled, and of pro-\ncedural practices that require or result in long delays in\nthe medical transition process, but also suggest need for\nsupports for those who may feel suicidal while in the\nprocess of transitioning.\nOur findings strongly suggest that interventions aimed\nat increasing social inclusion, reducing transphobic\ndiscrimination and violence, and facilitating access to\nmedical transition should be considered as part of a\ncomprehensive approach to suicide prevention in trans\npopulations, and evaluated to assess effectiveness. Such in-\nterventions need not supplant individual-level or thera-\npeutic approaches (e.g., psychotherapy, crisis services), but\nhave the potential to reduce suicide ideation and attempts\nby targeting stigma and social exclusion as fundamental\ncauses of disparities.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nGRB, JP, RT and RH planned and undertook the survey. GRB designed and\nconducted this analysis. GRB and AIS drafted the manuscript. All authors\ncontributed to the theoretical model, interpretation of results, and editing of\nthe manuscript.
