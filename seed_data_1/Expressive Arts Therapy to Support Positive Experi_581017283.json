Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 1Expressive Arts Therapy to Support Positive Experiences of EmbodimentAmong Rural LGBTQ+ Adults: A Literature ReviewCapstone ThesisLesley UniversityApril 18th, 2023Ann StromgrenExpressive Arts TherapyDr. KelloggRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 2AbstractThis paper investigates the use of expressive arts therapy to support LGBTQ+ adultclients in rural communities. Caring professionals in rural areas often lack training on how towork with LGBTQ+ clients, and best practices for clinical mental health counseling with ruralLGBTQ+ clients have yet to be defined. Some evidence suggests that using “metronormative”best practices with rural clients may be irrelevant or cause harm (Giano et al., 2020). Althoughsome recommendations exist for using expressive therapies with LGBTQ+ clients, they arerarely evidence-based, as very few empirical studies exist evaluating the effectiveness ofexpressive therapy interventions with LGBTQ+ populations. To address these gaps in theresearch, I use the lenses of rural queer theory and embodiment (a key component of expressivearts therapy) to explore how LGBTQ+ clients may experience their identities within a ruralcommunity context. I review empirical studies on LGBTQ+ embodiment, and the work of tworural queer theory scholars, to contextualize how a therapist might implement expressive artsinterventions ethically with rural LGBTQ+ clients. I describe five expressive arts interventionswhich show promise for supporting rural LGBTQ+ adults in cultivating positive experiences ofembodiment. Expressive arts therapy’s emphasis on embodiment may be useful to clients whoexperience oppression on the basis of sexuality and/or gender identity. Expressive arts therapysupports clients in articulating their own identities and stories, which is important because ruralLGBTQ+ adults may conceptualize their identities using a different paradigm than the one that isdominant in mainstream media, queer theory, and LGBTQ+ activism.Keywords: rural, LGBT, queer, embodiment, expressive arts, therapyThe author identifies as a straight-passing, able-bodied, US-born, queer, white, cisgenderwoman from Issaquah, WA, Portsmouth, NH, and Saint Paul, MN.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 3IntroductionI am a recent transplant to a town of under 3,000 people in Michigan’s rural UpperPeninsula. As someone who doesn’t trace my sense of belonging to anywhere in particular, whohas never spent more than a couple of years at a time in a small town, my perspective is largelyshaped by sociopolitically progressive, metropolitan media. Although I’m white, middle class,able-bodied, cisgender, and pass easily as both straight and Christian, I feel out of place in asmall town. How much more would someone from a minoritized group feel out of place?My assumption when I moved here was that I wouldn’t see LGBTQ+ people–at least notin highly visible community roles. Very quickly after arriving, I was delighted to be wrong! I sawpartnered queer people showing up together at the heart of church and community events. I tookthis as a sign that the community was surprisingly progressive and accepting. But after about sixmonths living here, I realized these couples weren’t actually “out” in the way I had assumed.Relationships that were obvious to me were not obvious to everyone, and were (I was baffled torealize) never explicitly acknowledged. My perception swung from delighted to horrified: howunfair, how dehumanizing, that these partnerships aren’t acknowledged like all the other familiesaround me? Instead of seeing my town as surprisingly progressive, I suddenly saw it as adangerous, oppressive place where queer people have to hide their identity and can’t be their trueselves. But as I have discovered while working on my thesis, that’s not the right answer, either.Something more complex was going on than my metronormative paradigm could account for.I started my master’s program in clinical mental health counseling with a specialization inexpressive arts therapy just after moving to my town. Much of my growing professional identityhas been shaped by my concern that my town is located within a desert of LGBTQ+ affirmingcare. While working on case studies and searching for resources for imaginary clients, I foundRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 4that a gay person would have to drive an hour or more to participate in organized LGBTQ+community events, or to find medical or mental health providers that identify themselves asqueer-affirming. A transgender person would have to drive six hours for gender-affirming care orfour hours for community events that center trans identity. As I look ahead to my career as amental health clinician in this area, I am determined to do what I can to ameliorate this resourcedesert. I want to be the best affirming support I can be for LGBTQ+ people in my area. Thisthesis is my attempt to begin exploring the question, what does that even mean?U.S. dominant culture holds a lot of stereotypes about both LGBTQ+ people and ruralcommunities. Media depictions and scholarly research tend to tell what Adichie (2009) called “asingle story” about both of these demographics. Combine these groups and the story is evenmore reductive: the sad rural child realizes they are different and progresses through achronological coming-of-age process from closeted to out, from repressed to healthy, from youthto adulthood, and from rural to urban spaces, where they live happily ever after (Schweighofer,2016). Schweighofer (2016) observed that this single coming-of-age narrative is dominant notjust in the minds of straight people but within LGBTQ+ communities as well, despite theprevalence of lived experience outside the bounds of this narrative. Adichie (2009) showed thatholding a single story about a group of people tends to breed paternalistic attitudes. She said,“It is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of thestories of that place and that person\" (Adichie, 2009, 13.33).The “assumption by omission\" (Watts-Jones, 2010, p.405) that LGBTQ+ people don’texist in rural spaces is pervasive throughout popular culture, queer studies, and LGBTQ+activism. The Movement Advancement Project (2019) noted that popular culture rarely showsLGBT people living in rural areas, except as victims of discrimination and violence or as peopleRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 5yearning to migrate to “more accepting” places (p.iii). Focus on urban populations in LGBT+research has been disproportionate enough for researchers to coin the term “metronormative'' todescribe the conflation of queer life with urban life (Halberstam, 2005, cited in Giano et al.,2020, p.241). Yet the Movement Advancement Project estimated that 2.9-3.8 million LGBTPeople live in Rural America, and national surveys of rural areas show that about the samepercentage of rural residents identify as LGBT as do residents of urban areas–between 3% and5% (Movement Advancement Project, 2019, p.iii). Metronormativity suggests that only largecities could be safe or desirable for LGBTQ+ people to live in, but rural queer theory scholarslike Schweighofer (2016) and Thomsen (2021) have shown that this is clearly not the case.Many LGBTQ+ adults live in rural areas because they love what rural communities haveto offer. As opposed to youth, who have little choice in where they live, LGBTQ+ adults wholive in rural areas are likely there because they made the choice to stay, or to return. They mayvalue the tight-knit community, the emphasis on family life, the grounding of institutions likechurches and schools, the connection to the land, and the ability to have a large influence in theircommunity, that frequently accompany life in the country (Movement Advancement Project,2019). And, geographical identity may be at least as important as LGBTQ+ identity (MovementAdvancement Project, 2019; Schweighofer, 2016). I in no way wish to minimize the trauma andoppression that many LGBTQ+ people do experience in rural areas, but my research has led meto understand that these experiences are not as universal as they are often portrayed to be.I started with a single story in my mind about how I was going to use expressive artstherapy to minister to the languishing LGBTQ+ people in my rural town–how I would create asafe space in which LGBTQ+ people could express their “true” selves through the arts and bewitnessed in their authenticity. Plenty of research exists to support this story, and that could haveRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 6been my thesis. But Schweighofer (2016) and Thomsen (2021) forced me to confront the singlestory I was holding about rural LGBTQ+ adults, and the paternalistic tone that thesis versionwould have had. Instead, my thesis is about how expressive arts therapy, with itsperson-centered, phenomenological, and iterative processes of embodied self-expression, is idealfor supporting rural LGBTQ+ clients in telling their own multitudes of stories. This is importantbecause many LGBTQ+ people have difficulty finding therapists who are familiar with queerissues regardless of location, and the lack of actively LGBTQ+-affirming mental healthprofessionals is particularly pronounced in rural areas (Donahue, 2019). If providers do seek outtraining in working with LGBTQ+ populations, the urban focus of queer studies means thatexisting scholarship may not be transferable to rural LGBTQ+ clients’ experiences. In thefollowing literature review, I examine the metronormative bias of existing scholarship onLGBTQ+ populations, the ways in which rural cultural contexts may shape LGBTQ+ people’sexperiences, the literature on how LGBTQ+ people experience embodiment in daily life, andwhat types of expressive arts therapy interventions show promise for supporting rural LGBTQ+adults in articulating their own needs and resources related to embodiment. My goal with thiscapstone project is to expand my awareness of what LGBTQ+ clients living in my rural townmay experience and to use this awareness to contextualize application of expressive artsinterventions supported in the literature for use with LGBTQ+ adults.MethodsGoogle Scholar and the Lesley Library search engine were my primary tools for findingscholarly sources to review. I occasionally used Google's general search engine when I felt stuck,in order to identify keywords and phrases. Sometimes I used Google to find resources that weremore oriented toward activism or services that might be available to the population under study. IRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 7used Lesley’s interlibrary loan service to acquire relevant articles or book chapters. I originallyhoped to limit inclusion to articles five years old or less, but I found that resources on the topic ofqueer theory specifically related to rural areas, embodiment, or the arts were sparse enough that Ineeded to expand my search to include sources up to around ten years old. I occasionallyreferenced older sources when I found they were cited frequently in the literature I was studying,or for the purpose of establishing points of expressive arts theory. My search terms includedvarious combinations of the following: LGBT, queer, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, sexualminority, minority, marginalized identities, rural, nonurban, anti-urban, small town, mentalhealth, therapy, psychotherapy, counseling, expressive arts, expressive arts therapy, creative arts,creative arts therapy, art therapy, music therapy, dance therapy, movement therapy, embodiment,somatics, mindfulness, presentation, clothing, attire, style, visual language, visual culture,witnessing, visibility, imagination, imaginative, and imaginal. I found that searches using otherpermutations of LGBT such as GLBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQ+, LGBTQIA, LGBTQIA+, andLGBT2SQ produced redundant results. Once per month, starting in November, I created a visualart piece to express current themes in my self-reflexive process of engaging with this thesisproject (see Appendix). I have also included in the Appendix an image I created last year, whichrepresents the beginning of my journey of understanding how much I don’t know about howqueer visibility functions in my small town.I begin my literature review by critiquing the existing research about rural LGBTQ+populations. I discuss gaps in the research, conflicting evidence, and how the current literature isshaped by metronormative bias. I critique the ubiquitous assumption that rural LGBTQ+ peopleneed social interaction with communities centered specifically around LGBTQ+ identity. Then Iexplore the need for intersectionality in therapeutic work and research, and how the lack of anRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 8intersectional lens contributes to gaps and conflicting evidence in the research on LGBTQ+populations. I draw from two rural queer theorists to understand how rural LGBTQ+ paradigmsmay differ from metronormative ones. Given the lack of established best practices for mentalhealth counseling with rural LGBTQ+ populations, I discuss how expressive arts therapy isuniquely resourced to help clients articulate their own stories, needs, and strengths. I giveparticular attention to expressive arts therapy’s focus on embodiment through the arts. Fewempirical studies exist evaluating the therapeutic benefit of specific expressive therapyinterventions with LGBTQ+ populations, and studies related to expressive therapies with ruralLGBTQ+ populations are practically nonexistent. Therefore, I examine studies related to howLGBTQ+ people experience embodiment in their daily lives as a way to contextualize whatethical use of expressive arts interventions centering embodiment might look like for thesepopulations. I describe five expressive arts therapy interventions which show promise forsupporting rural LGBTQ+ adults in achieving positive experiences of embodiment whilearticulating their unique identities. Throughout the literature review, I use the lens of rural queertheory to understand how the needs of rural LGBTQ+ clients may differ from those in urbansettings when engaging in expressive arts therapy.Literature ReviewLimitations of Existing ResearchScholars in the area of rural LGBTQ+ life frequently critique the paucity of research onthese populations. Rickard and Yancey (2018) described existing data on rural LGBTQ+populations as scant and limited in generalizability, explaining that studies tend to be qualitative,geographically limited, and focused on the experiences of gay men (Rickard & Yancey, 2018).Rickard and Yancey (2018) also cited several studies showing that mental health practitioners inRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 9rural areas tend to be unaware of best practices for sexual minorities. Gaps in research on ruralLGBTQ+ populations are evident in the overextension of queer identity development models,which were based predominantly on the experiences of upper-middle-class white men (Hulko &Hovanes, 2018), and reliance on the implicit assumption that the deleterious effects of hidingsexual identity are worse than the consequences of disclosing (Giano et al., 2020). As Giano etal. demonstrated in their 2020 study, the effects of outness on psychological well-being differdepending on geographic location. Giano et. al. (2020) found that higher levels of outnessamplified the distress participants experienced in response to gay-related rejection forparticipants living in rural but not in urban areas. This has great significance for mental healthprofessionals, who could inadvertently cause harm to rural LGBTQ+ clients by advocating forincreased self-disclosure based on metronormative models of identity development. Otherlimitations of existing research on rural LGBTQ+ populations include inconsistency and lack ofnuance in how the term “rural” is defined (Movement Advancement Project, 2019), and lack ofexplanation for how this term is operationalized in studies. Additionally, discourse on queerspaces often focuses on nightlife and youth culture (Rickard & Yancey, 2018), leaving out theexperiences of LGBTQ+ parents, older adults, and those in substance recovery. While focus onnightlife as the epicenter of queer community may leave out LGBTQ+ people in committedrelationships (Rickard & Yancey, 2018), some studies run the opposite risk, defining LGBTQ+identity by the presence of a committed relationship and leaving out LGBTQ+ adults in ruralareas who are single, such as Ghaziani (2015), discussed in Thomsen (2021).Conflicting Evidence on Rural LGBTQ+ PopulationsResearch shows conflicting results about whether living in rural areas is more difficult forLGBTQ+ adults than living in urban areas. Swank et al.’s (2012) study showed that overall, ruralRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 10LGB participants experienced higher levels of minority stress, discrimination, and isolation thanurban LGB participants. Pachankis et al. (2020) drew on the work of Galliher et al. (2004) andPoon and Saewyc (2009) to argue that LGBTQ+ adults in rural areas carry a “disproportionateburden of stress-sensitive mental health problems and health-risk behaviors compared to theirurban peers\" (p.430). Woodell (2017) wrote that LGBTQ+ people have worse health outcomesthan heterosexual people due to minority stress, and people living in rural areas, regardless ofsexual orientation, have worse health outcomes than those living in urban areas. This has ledresearchers to assume that LGBTQ+ people living in rural areas would have worse healthoutcomes than their urban counterparts, and some research does support this assumption(Woodell, 2017). Some researchers have argued that the scarcity of healthcare options in ruralareas exacerbates the link between minority stress and worse health outcomes for LGBTQ+people, who may delay or avoid treatment because they experience or expect discrimination inhealthcare settings (Woodell, 2017). However, some studies have found either no difference orhigher measures of health in rural LGBTQ+ populations (Woodell, 2017). Swank et al. (2012)acknowledged that some studies have shown no difference in the levels of minority stressexperienced by urban versus rural LGBTQ+ people. Thomsen (2021) pointed out previousscholarship showing no more hate crimes per capita in rural areas, with the explanation that hatecrimes rely on a level of anonymity that doesn’t exist in rural communities (xii). Thomsen alsoreferenced the work of Howard (2006) and Wienke and Hill (2013), whose studies showed thatLGBTQ+ people living in rural areas report equal or even higher levels of well-being and senseof safety than LGBTQ+ people in urban areas, despite “negotiations” like fewer public displaysof affection (p.xii). The Movement Advancement Project (2019) reported, “LGBT people inurban and rural areas report similar levels of subjective well-being, health, and satisfaction\"Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 11(p.iii). These conflicting figures may stem from the Movement Advancement Project’s findingthat rural life amplifies the impact of both acceptance and rejection (Movement AdvancementProject, 2019). While studies of LGBTQ+ people in rural areas tend to focus on negativeexperiences, when given the chance, participants often express satisfaction with the high qualityof life, close-knit social connections, and acceptance they experience in their rural communities(Woodell, 2017). While study bias likely plays a role, another cause for conflicting researchresults is the wide diversity within rural LGBTQ+ populations. Swank et al. (2012) pointed outthat levels of minority stress appear to vary greatly depending on factors like gender, generation,and regional subculture, and Woodell (2017) also emphasized that regional culture makes a bigdifference. While “rural states are significantly less likely to have vital nondiscrimination lawsand more likely to have harmful, discriminatory laws,” the impact of these laws on individualLGBTQ+ people is highly variable depending on location (Movement AdvancementProject, 2019, p.iii).IntersectionalityIntersectionality is a lens often missing in research on rural LGBTQ+ populations, whichmay account for some of the seemingly contradictory data generated in studies. Thomsen (2021)observed that “gay men often stand in for an imagined LGBTQ community\" (xii). As previouslydiscussed, the majority of the research on LGBTQ+ people has centered on the experiences ofgay men. Some studies suggest that lesbian women are more likely to live in the country, whilegay men are more likely to live in the city (Kazyak, 2012; Ghaziani, 2015, as cited in Thomsen,2021). Because of the ways performative masculinity and femininity map onto queer identitiesand urban versus rural geographies, heterosexual norms in rural spaces affect LGBTQ+ peoplequite differently depending on their gender. Kazyak (2012) argued that some forms of femaleRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 12masculinity are in fact normative in rural spaces, not transgressive, because many aspects of rurallife are coded as masculine. This same dynamic makes practices of male femininity particularlytransgressive in rural spaces. Kazyak (2012) explained, “Both lesbian women and gay men gainacceptance in rural areas by doing masculinity\" (p.825). Thomsen (2021) wrote in response toKazyak’s (2012) insights that “The gendered make-up of rural LGBTQ life, then, ought to makeus consider for whom these spaces are unbecoming and for whom they are, actually, liberating\"(p.xii). In addition to gender and sexuality, Schweighofer (2016) named several other“hierarchies and power dynamics—family connections, class status…local conflicts and disputesbetween neighbors” which “play a large role, and perhaps may be more likely to determine thelevel of acceptable gay or lesbian visibility than any particular gendered or sexual behavior\"(Schweighofer, 2016, p.233). Similarly, Hulko and Hovanes’s (2018) intersectional analysis intheir qualitative study of young adult lesbian and bisexual women living in a small town inCanada revealed that the variation in impact of identifying and being identified as queer wasdirectly related to other identities like class, faith, indigenous ancestry, and disability. Withregard to race, Kazyak (2012) wrote, “The racial homogeneity in rural areas (U.S. Bureau of theCensus 2000) no doubt means that whites, unlike people of color, have a greater ability toassert…belonging and have it legitimated,” even if they are queer (Kazyak, 2012, p.827). It’simportant for clinicians to understand that each letter in the LGBT acronym is a uniquepopulation which feels the impact of cis-hetero norms differently based on the intersections ofgender and sexuality. It’s also important to note, as Schweighofer (2016) has, that LGBTQ+identity itself is likely not the most salient factor constructing how LGBTQ+ people experienceminority stress in rural communities. But perhaps most important of all is Hulko and Hovanes’s(2018) finding that participants felt marginalized in LGBTQ+ spaces that did not inviteRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 13discussion of their other identities. Providing affirming care means actively affirming the entiretyof someone’s identity, and resisting assumptions about how people may prioritize their identities.Need for Like Community. One common theme that research on rural LGBTQ+populations often explores is the extent to which LGBTQ+ individuals feel connected tospecifically LGBTQ+ community. Swank et al. (2012) explained that connection with LGBT+community “is considered a group-level coping resource for dealing with the negative effects ofminority stress\" (p.227). Swank et al. (2012) wrote that “feeling part of a community of similarothers\" (p.227) allows LGBTQ+ adults to compare themselves positively with others instead ofseeing themselves through the negative lens with which dominant groups tend to see out-groups.However, Woodell (2017) described mixed results in the research about how connection toLGBTQ+ community, or lack of this connection, affects the well-being of LGBTQ+ adults.Woodell (2017) pointed out that this may be because researchers have conceptualized socialsupport for LGBTQ+ people too narrowly. Conventionally, researchers have assumed thatLGBTQ+ people need social interactions with other LGBTQ+ people at events that centeraround LGBTQ+ identity, but this assumption may cause researchers to miss the ways in whichLGBTQ+ people living in rural areas actually conceive of social support (p.2, p.9). LGBTQ+people may, in fact, “feel part of a community of similar others” based on a multitude of otheridentity factors besides sexual orientation or gender modality.LGBTQ+ Identity as a “Master Status.” Hetherington et al. (2021) referenced Hadley(2013) in their observation that “subjugated identities easily take over in defining ourselves\"(p.61). Whereas privileged positionalities act as a blank canvas onto which individuals can painttheir personal identity (p.61), marginalized positionalities appear prominent because they are nottaken for granted, and individuals must consciously negotiate how much power they allow theRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 14marginalized identity to have in their sense of self. It might be easy to assume based on gayliberationist rhetoric that LGBTQ+ status is a primary part of a client’s identity, but this may notbe the case. The gay men in Clarke and Smith’s (2014) study were clear in asserting that theiridentities were too complex to be filtered through queerness as a “master status\" (p.22), and theyexpressed disdain for men whom they perceived as prioritizing their gay identity above all otheridentities. Chauhan et al.’s (2021) gay and transgender participants emphasized ethnic, cultural,financial, and lifestyle factors in what they chose to wear, but rarely mentioned sexualorientation or gender identity. The accentuation of gay identity has roots in the Gay Liberationmovement of the 1970s, when self-acceptance became conflated with heightened visibility andloud celebration of queer identity (Duncan, 2010). But as Schweighofer (2016) pointed out, “outand proud” as a standard for self-actualization makes less sense when a person’s authenticintersectional identity incorporates a variety of roles, relationships, and cultural aspects whichmay feel more salient to the person than their sexual orientation. For some people, highlightingtheir LGBTQ+ identity in how they present themselves to the world may be most importantduring an initial coming-out process, but as they grow older and become more comfortable intheir identities, they may feel less need to accentuate queer identity over others (Clarke et al.,2012; Yost & Chmielewski, 2011). For Minghini, the transgender “lived experience author\"(p.55) working with Hetherington et al. (2021), the freeing realization that transgenderexperience was just one part of his identity came only after he had gone through an extendedprocess of therapeutic body tracing which helped him to accept his body as something he couldinhabit with agency; after this realization, he came to define himself more by what he enjoyeddoing and what he was passionate about. LGBTQ+ identity as a master status is a problematicidea that many LGBTQ+ people resist. The clinician should be careful not to assume thatRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 15LGBTQ+ status is primary to a client’s personal identity, since this assumption is rooted incisheteronormative hegemony.Rural Queer TheoryMuch of queer theory and activism is centered around the idea that queer visibility is “anuncontestable social good, as that which everyone everywhere desires\" (Thomsen, 2021, p.viii).However, as I have begun to observe after living in my town for a couple of years, queervisibility functions differently here than in a city. Metronormative ideas about queer visibility arerooted in, and reinforce, false binaries like gay versus straight, closeted versus out, public versusprivate space, and urban versus rural (Schweighofer, 2016; Thomsen, 2021; Hulko, 2018). Bymetronormative standards, if rural LGBTQ+ adults are not loud and explicit about their queeridentities, there must be a terrible problem. In fact, rural queer visibility exists in a differentparadigm entirely. The conflations of rural with closeted and homophobic, urban with out andproud, and loud and proud with wellness and authenticity erase the queer flourishing that hasalways existed in rural spaces (Schweighofer, 2016; Thomsen, 2021). They position urbandefinitions of queer identity and visibility as the only valid ones, and “out, loud, and proud”LGBTQ+ people as the only ones who are participating “correctly” in social struggle(Schweighofer, 2016; Thomsen; 2021). “It is my position,” wrote Thomsen, “that rural LGBTQwomen are illegible not to rural people but to urban people; self-identified liberals, progressives,and leftists; and gay rights groups, and further, that rural LGBTQ women become illegiblethrough visibility discourses\" (2021, p.x). Her argument provides striking support for the ideathat caring professionals may do more harm than good if they apply metronormative bestpractices to rural LGBTQ+ populations.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 16Schweighofer (2016) described many ways in which metronormative assumptions aboutvisibility break down in a rural community. For example, many spaces function simultaneouslyas public and private, and people and businesses can openly use subtle signals and marketingrelated to LGBTQ+ identity which flies under the radar to those out of the know. The lack ofprivacy in small communities creates an “open secret” paradox, in which a person’s LGBTQ+identity may be generally known and yet treated as “inappropriate for, or just too obvious towarrant, public conversation\" (Gray, 2009, p.96). Gray (2009) discussed how rural LGBTQ+people can experience the open secret as an oppressive force, causing them to police their ownbehavior and expression; but Schweighofer (2016) argued that although the pressures of the opensecret are unjust, the ways queer people take ownership of the fluidity available within the opensecret, in the contradictions of being simultaneously visible and invisible, undermine theheteronormative premise that queer people are easily classified and must reveal themselves.The metaphor of the closet falls apart if there is nothing to reveal that is integral toidentity (Schweighofer, p.235). Schweighofer pointed out that sexual contact with someone ofthe same gender is not always labeled as “gay” behavior, nor does such behavior necessarilydefine someone’s identity (p.234). Urban researchers coined the term “MSM” (“men who havesex with men”) to address the fact that same-gender sexual contact does not necessarilyconstitute gay identity. Though this language was meant to be inclusive of a broader range ofexperiences, both the heterosexual mainstream and the urban out gay communities tend to viewMSM as being closeted, rather than as people whose experiences have more nuance than LGBTidentity labels can capture (Schweighofer, p.235). Schweighofer noted that people who resistidentity categories don’t show up in the research. It’s difficult to debunk the conflation of ruralwith closet when the experiences adding expansiveness and nuance to the conversation are notRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 17even in the same paradigm. While city people may assume that rural areas lack diversity, it mayalso be true that the way diversity shows up in rural lives is not legible to city people atfirst glance.Rural mental health professionals’ lack of training in best practices for working withLGBTQ+ populations is a serious issue (Rickard & Yancey, 2018). Even more concerning is thatbest practices for clinical mental health counseling with rural LGBTQ+ populations do not existyet. Clinicians with consciousness around LGBTQ+ issues and training in working withLGBTQ+ populations are likely to be informed as I was by metronormative representations ofLGBTQ+ stories in mainstream media, queer theory, and LGBTQ+ activism. Yet conflictingevidence in the research that does exist around rural LGBTQ+ issues shows that themetronormative paradigm is not sufficient for understanding the needs and resources that ruralLGBTQ+ clients may bring to therapy. Some evidence demonstrates that applyingunderstandings from metronormative research and queer theory may actively harm ruralLGBTQ+ clients. While diverse identity factors may not be visible to mental health clinicianswhen they begin working with a rural LGBTQ+ client, this is precisely why it is so importantthat therapists use an intersectional lens; the kinds of identity factors and roles that feel authenticto a rural LGBTQ+ client, and their salience relative to each other, may be quite different fromthe intersectional identity of an LGBTQ+ person living in a city. Rural LGBTQ+ adults mayconceptualize their identities using a different paradigm than the one that is dominant inmainstream media, queer theory, and LGBTQ+ activism. No standard training exists to preparemental health counselors for working with these clients. Therefore, rural LGBTQ+ adultsdeserve a form of therapy that goes beyond simplistic person-centered standards to facilitate theclient articulating their own paradigm, in their own way. Expressive arts therapy, with itsRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 18boundless possibilities for supporting client expression, its emphasis on intersectionality andmultiplicity, and its reverence for the client as the expert of their own experience, is uniquelysuited to the task.Expressive Arts Therapy as a Treatment ModalityExpressive arts therapy is a person-centered clinical mental health therapeutic practiceinformed by eclectic theories of “talk therapy” counseling and incorporating embodied,expressive, and cognitive elements of universal human creativity into the healing processthrough the experiential application of expressive forms like visual art, music, movement, drama,and writing (Rogers, 1993; Malchiodi, 2023). One distinct element of expressive arts therapy isits emphasis on “multimodal” and “intermodal” creative processes, in which multiple expressiveforms are used simultaneously or in sequence to deepen the process of holistic healing andinsight (Knill, 2005). While “expressive arts therapy” is a field with its own distinct theory, I usethe term “expressive therapies” to refer to work from any field which uses creative practicestherapeutically; in addition to expressive arts therapy, this includes fields like art therapy, musictherapy, dance/movement therapy, drama therapy, narrative therapy, etc. (Estrella, 2023, p.82).Expressive arts therapy draws from each of these other creative therapeutic traditions, soliterature from these fields is relevant to expressive arts therapy as well.In the following sections, I review empirical studies on LGBTQ+ embodiment, using thisevidence as well as the lens of rural queer theory to contextualize how a therapist mightimplement expressive arts interventions which have either been recommended in the literaturefor use with LGBTQ+ populations, or which show promise for supporting rural LGBTQ+ peoplein cultivating positive experiences of embodiment based on the evidence from LGBTQ+embodiment studies.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 19EmbodimentSince gender and sexuality are intimately tied to embodied experience, I guessed thatpeople who are minoritized on the basis of gender and sexuality may benefit from therapeuticinterventions that support positive experiences of embodiment. I also wondered howconcealment of sexuality and gender identity (which I assumed to be a common experience inrural areas) may affect a person’s embodied experience of their identity. Embodiment is afoundational aspect of expressive arts therapy, so expressive arts have rich potential to supportclients’ positive experiences of embodiment. However, empirical studies on the efficacy of arts-and body-based therapeutic interventions for LGBTQ+ populations are practically nonexistent,especially in rural contexts. To use body-based interventions wisely, I wanted to gather context tohelp me understand how LGBTQ+ clients in rural areas may experience embodiment in theirdaily lives. When I began researching LGBTQ+ embodiment, I was quickly overwhelmed by thefact that LGBT denotes many, many populations, each with their own sociopolitical historyaround the body.Embodiment in Expressive Arts TherapyThe concept of embodiment is central to expressive arts therapy. Estrella (2023) namedembodiment as one of the “shared qualities\" (p.83) or “common factors\" (p.84) that unite all thediverse iterations of expressive arts practice. Knill (2005) discussed aesthetic response, a visceralsense of being “moved” by a creative work or process, as a foundation for therapeutic work.Halprin (2008) wrote that movement-based expressive arts practices allow people to not onlyaccess deeply embodied knowledge and emotions but also witness and creatively shape them,deprogramming conditioned responses and freeing clients to respond and enact consciously intheir lives (p.18). Hinz wrote that the therapeutic functions in providing kinesthetic-orientedRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 20expressive experiences “involve not just an awareness of the body, but actually increasing ordecreasing clients' amount of physical arousal and tension\" (2019, p.43). Arts-facilitatedpendulation can help to restore flexibility to the nervous system, and also allow the client achance to consciously decouple emotions from the physical sensations they notice (Richardson,2016, p.73). Vaisvaser (2021) wrote that the field of neuroscience increasingly sees cognition asan embodied function in which brain activity and somatosensory information work in concert tocreate mental experience. Changes in muscular, hormonal, and nervous system states give rise toboth the experience of emotional states and the attribution of meaning to raw experiences(Vaisvaser, 2021, p.2). Vaisvaser (2021) wrote that this neuroscientific understanding ofemotions, responses, and meaning-making helps to explain why creative arts therapies are soeffective in treating trauma and other mental health concerns: by engaging somatosensoryfunctions of the body in affective and expressive experience in a safe environment, the brain’simplicit predictions may be elicited and disconfirmed. The creative arts offer both a way to elicitaffective experience without the client needing to recount details of a troubling experience, andsensorily rich new experiences which the client’s embodied cognition can reintegrate into itsexpectations of the world (p.5).Differences in Embodied Experience by Identity GroupThe literature on LGBTQ+ embodiment shows that people experience their bodies quitedifferently depending on which specific identity group they belong to, the social dynamics withinthat particular identity community, and how the specific identity mediates dominant culturalmessages about the body.Clarke et al. noted in their 2012 literature review that research comparing body image inlesbian and heterosexual women has yielded mixed results: some studies have concluded thatRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 21lesbian women’s identity development and interaction with feminist ideology offered protectivefactors against the internalization of woman-objectifying cultural messages, while other studieshave shown no difference in body image between lesbian and heterosexual women (p.17). Mostof the lesbian participants in Yost and Chmielewski’s (2011) study felt shame about their weightsimilar to concerns documented in body image studies of heterosexual women. At the same time,these women demonstrated greater conscious resistance to dominant culture beauty standards,and focused their attention much more on how their bodies felt and what they could do. Thisemphasis aligns with previous research showing that lesbian women tend to value fitness overthinness (Beren et al., 1997, as cited in Yost & Chmielewski, 2011).Ambivalence about the body is a common theme in studies of gay male embodiment.This same ambivalence permeates the field of research on gay men’s body image, with extensiveliterature documenting the appearance-related pressures men face within gay male subculture,and other researchers critiquing the gay body image field of study itself for reinforcing thestereotype that gay men are obsessed with their looks (Clarke et al., 2012; Clarke & Smith,2014). Duncan’s (2010) gay male participants sought to distance themselves from this stereotype,yet they acknowledged a strict body hierarchy within gay social circles in which lean, muscular,hairless, and tanned bodies indicated status and privilege. These participants went to greatlengths to manage, modify, and “perfect” their bodies, while simultaneously distancingthemselves from the perceived “excesses” and “obsessions” associated with these practices(Duncan, 2010, p.447). Research on gay men’s body image tends to focus on how bodystandards are policed within gay male communities, and while Duncan’s (2010) participants diddescribe this dynamic, their justifications for striving toward the lean-muscular-hairless idealtended to be oriented around dominant culture’s perceptions, like the need to be hypermasculineRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 22in order to debunk stereotypes of gay male effeminacy, or the belief that they would be morereadily accepted by the general (heterosexual) population if their appearance was impeccable.Bisexual identity tends to be marginalized both in research and in LGBTQ+ communityspaces (Clarke et al., 2012; Nelson, 2020). Nelson (2020) claimed that embodied effects ofbisexual erasure and discrimination can be seen in multiple international studies whose resultsshow that bisexuals are more likely than any other sexual identity group to experience “anxiety,depression, suicidality, eating problems, self-harm, domestic violence, and sexual violence\"(p.592). Attention to the specific experiences of bisexual people is particularly important forclinicians working in rural settings, because “some research has found that more of the ruralsexual minority population identified as bisexual compared to the urban residents in theirsample\" (Fisher et al., 2014, as cited in Woodell, 2017, p.7). Bowes-Catton et al.’s (2011) twoarts-informed studies on bisexual embodiment demonstrated that opportunities to connect withother bisexual people and to explore bisexual identity as distinct from other LGBTQ+ identitiesoffered the participants a sense of relief in being able to relax in their bodies and “just be\" (p.9).Hetherington et al. (2021) wrote that “trans experience is often erroneously equated to themore dominant narrative [within the LGBT umbrella] of LGB experience\" (p.57). As a gendermodality rather than a sexual orientation, transgender identity involves experiences and ways ofrelating to the body which tend to be quite different from what LGB people commonlyexperience. The transgender participants in Huttunen et al.’s (2019) study reported feelingdisconnected from their body, as if their body was a strange thing existing next to them. Oneparticipant explained that feeling tactile sensations in a part of their body which did not feel likea part of their person (ie: sharp cheek bones) heighted the sense of alienation from that part of thebody. Huttunen et al. (2019) wrote in their analysis that participants’ embodied emotions bothRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 23spurred them to seek information about gender identity possibilities and helped them to discernwhich information was relevant for them. Developing forms of presentation that brought theparticipants happiness also developed the participants’ sense of knowing themselves in anembodied way. In this way, wrote Huttunen et al., engaging with their embodied cognition,responding to their bodies’ inherent knowing, decreased participants’ sense of alienation fromtheir bodies.Of all the studies referenced in this section, only one (Yost & Chmielewski, 2011) dealtwith participants living in a rural environment. Much of the above information deals with howpeople relate to others within their specific identity group, which is likely to be different if, likethe participants in Yost and Chmielewski’s study (2011), they don’t have access to a communityof people who share their specific sexual or gender identity. But a rural setting can changeembodied sexual identity in other ways as well. Little and Leyshon (2003) observed that the ruralbody is rarely portrayed as sexy. In a variety of mediums, the sexuality of rural women and menalike is portrayed as reserved, conventional, and non-threatening. Even in nude calendarsfeaturing rural subjects, the sexuality of the bodies is deemphasized; the tone is humorous, andthe bodies are presented as “homely and cuddly” rather than seductive (p.267). Little andLeyshon also observed that mentions of physical attraction in rural newspaper dating columnsand in TV shows featuring rural matchmaking are often completely absent. If people in smalltowns seek to distance the body from any kind of overt sexuality, even heterosexuality, then ruralLGBTQ+ people may experience their embodied sexuality differently than those in cities notbecause of repression but because of regional differences in culture. Therapists should keep inmind when planning experientials around embodiment that explicit focus on sexuality may notbe relevant or accessible to rural clients.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 24Embodiment Through Self-PresentationThe concepts of embodiment and presentation are intricately tied. Particularly during aninitial coming out process, visual presentation serves as a primary way that LGBTQ+ peopleseek to embody and assert their identities (Clarke et al., 2012; Yost & Chmielewski, 2011;Duncan, 2010). The way people choose to present themselves affects how they experience theirbodies, as with Huttunen et al.’s (2019) trans participants who felt their bodies were a part ofthemselves only after their presentation matched their identity. The way people feel about theirbodies affects how they present themselves and share their identities, as with Duncan’s (2010)participant who only chose to present himself as gay when his body matched a specific visualideal. In Huttunen et al.’s (2019) analysis, felt sense in the body guides people toward knowledgeabout their identities and toward presentation choices that are most aligned with those identities.In the studies I examined on embodiment, participants’ choices about their self-presentationincluded clothing, jewelry, hairstyles, movement, gesture, body shaping, and vocal expression.Reddy-Best and Pedersen (2014) discussed clothing as a visual metaphor for identity; they wrotethat a person’s sense of self is formed continuously through the person’s use of symbols tomanage and mediate between their internal experience and other people’s impressions of them.As such, experimenting with different styles allows people to express and process in anembodied way multiple conflicting identities and the ambivalence they may feel about theiridentities (Reddy-Best & Pedersen, 2014). Expressive therapy interventions can support clientsin experimenting with different ways of presenting themselves, while the embodimentcomponent of expressive arts therapy can help to ground clients as they process ambivalencearound different aspects of identity.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 25Expressive Arts Therapy for Positive Experiences of EmbodimentPiran’s Recommendations for Positive Experience of Embodiment. Experience ofEmbodiment was the core construct that emerged from Nivan Piran’s 2016 grounded theoryresearch program to explore how women and girls experience their bodies as they engage withthe world. Analysis of interviews with 69 participants aged nine to 69 showed five centraldimensions of the Experience of Embodiment, each a continuum from positive to negativeexperience: body connection and comfort, agency and functionality, experience and expressionof desire, attuned self-care, and inhabiting the body as a subjective site. Positive experiences onone dimension correlated with positive experiences on others, and the quality of participants’experiences of embodiment changed across the lifespan and in different social environments.Piran’s (2016) research suggested that the therapy process can incorporate the development ofattuned self-care practices, identification of meaningful passions to engage in, and “immersion injoyful physical activities” as a means to increase clients’ experience of positiveembodiment (p.59).Voice as a Means to Embodiment. In Piran’s 2016 grounded theory study of howwomen and girls related to their bodies, voice emerged as a central theme of the Agencydimension of the Experience of Embodiment construct: participants described expressingthemselves through singing and speaking up about things they were passionate about as waysthat they claimed their embodied agency (p.49). Similarly, a participant in Yost andChmielewski’s 2011 study said, “I feel proud to… have that kind of power that comes with beinga large woman and having a large voice and speaking up\" (p.156). In their 2019 study, Huttunenet al. found that voice had great significance for how their transgender participants experiencedand expressed their gender identity (p.7). Some participants made recordings of their voice overRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 26the course of hormone treatment to document changes. Vocal training is an important part ofsocial transition for many transgender people (Lerario, 2022). Regardless of the identity groups aperson belongs to, voice is a powerfully integrative force: the body produces it, it resonatesthrough the body, shifting energies and muscular states, it carries expressions of will and emotionoutward, it is symbolic of the self, and has the power to effect one’s agency in the world.Considerations for Planning Groups versus Individual Therapy. In several of thestudies I reviewed, participants expressed that being able to interact with others who shared theirspecific sexual or gender identity (as opposed to a general LGBT group) supported positiveexperiences of embodiment. The lesbian participants in Yost and Chmielewski’s (2011) studycredited support from lesbian communities with helping them become comfortable withnon-normative qualities of their bodies. Bowes-Catton et al.’s (2011) participants said that beingin a community space specifically for bisexual people led to feelings of expansion, openness,connectedness with their surroundings, and finally being able to breathe freely. Furman et al.’s(2019) participants called their transgender and nonbinary group “A space where people get it\"(p.1), and said that clarifying their embodied experiences through body mapping in a group ofsupportive peers was relaxing and comforting. The gay men in Duncan’s (2010) study, on theother hand, experienced gay community as a rigidly critical and regulating force that engenderedexperiences of self-objectification rather than positive experiences of embodiment. With regardto combined LGBTQ+ spaces, Nelson (2020) pointed out that bisexual people can experienceerasure, marginalization, and “heterophobia” from the broader gay community (p.596).Hetherington et al. (2021) emphasized that care must be taken to address the needs oftransgender people in LGBT spaces, because it is false to assume that a generallyqueer-affirming space is safe for trans people by default.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 27Given the diversity of identities under the LGBTQ+ umbrella and the potential formarginalization of specific identities within a combined LGBTQ+ space, individual therapy maybe preferable for expressive arts interventions related to embodiment when multiple clientsholding a specific identity are not available to form a group. Additionally, some clients may needthe privacy of individual therapy in order to process material related to embodiment.Hetherington et al. (2021) emphasized the importance of privacy when the client’s body is notjust a means of artistic exploration but also the subject of the exploration. While Minghini’s worktook place within the context of an LGBTQ+ group, the majority of his body-tracing project tookplace in the absence of other group members, which Hetherington et al. (2021) reflected wasnecessary for Minghini to feel free enough to explore as deeply as he did. Hetherington et al.’s(2021) caution against body tracing in a group setting contrasts with the procedure of Furman etal. (2019), and with the long history of body mapping in the setting of group workshops (DeJager, 2016). It may be that Minghini could have felt more comfortable engaging in body tracingin a group specifically for nonbinary clients, as existed in Furman et al.’s (2019) study, asopposed to an LGBTQ+ group. Differing needs for privacy may also relate to the bottom-upnature of body tracing, whereas body mapping’s top-down focus on symbolism allows somereflective distance from the physicality of the body.While these recommendations relate to LGBTQ-specific groups, the reader shouldremember here that some evidence and theory suggest that rural LGBTQ+ adults may receiveadequate social support from groups that are not centered around LGBTQ+ identity (Woodell,2017; Schweighofer, 2016). Given that rural LGBTQ+ adults may experience other aspects oftheir identities as more salient than gender identity or sexual orientation (Schweighofer, 2016),Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 28clients for whom this is true may do very well in expressive therapy groups that are not specificto any LGBTQ+ identity.InterventionsBody Mapping and Body Tracing. Body mapping using a life-size outline of the bodywas developed in the 1980s as a visual methodology for qualitative participatory research (DeJager, 2016). In body mapping, an outline is made of the participant’s body and the participantadds a variety of images, symbols, and decorations onto the outline as they reflect on theirembodied experiences. In therapeutic settings, body mapping has been used as a tool forprocessing trauma, accessing emotions, and facilitating communication about present-momentembodied emotional states (De Jager, 2016). Hetherington et al.’s (2021) body tracing methodplaces special emphasis on the experiential and symbolic power of here-and-now encountersbetween client and therapist, and client and image during the body tracing process. The authorswrote that the multisensory nature of artmaking makes the act of body tracing itself a powerfulway to integrate unconscious and embodied feelings with symbolic and relational meanings.While a typical body-mapping intervention would focus on the images the client chooses to fillin the outline, Hetherington et al.’s (2021) body tracing process invites the client to renegotiatethe outline, erasing, modifying, or emphasizing any part they wish. After gradually filling in theoutline over the course of several sessions, the client is invited to dialogue with and tell storiesabout the image. Hetherington et al. (2021) emphasized the client’s agency in this process, andthe way that mindful attention to bodily felt-sense responses to the process creates a validatingsense of wholeness as they are incorporated into the artwork. Although both methods center thebody, body mapping tends to be more of a top-down approach, whereas body tracing is abottom-up approach (Hetherington et al., 2021).Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 29Photo Diaries. Reddy-Best and Pedersen (2014), Nelson (2020), and Bowes-Catton et al.(2011) all used photo diaries as an arts-based component of their research into how certainpopulations under the LGBTQ+ umbrella experience the embodiment and presentation of theiridentities. Reddy-Best and Pedersen (2014) used photo diaries to explore how queer-identifyingwomen felt about their clothing choices in relation to their identity and to different spaces theyoccupied. Nelson’s (2020) participants kept photo diaries to document their strategies forrepresenting their bisexual identity and the ways in which their presentation shifted acrossdifferent spaces. Bowes-Catton et al.’s (2011) bisexual participants took photos of theirembodied experiences at BiCon, and during the week following the convention, making note ofthe embodied sensations that had prompted each photo. In each study, participants created theirphoto diaries over the course of one or two weeks and processed their reactions to the photos andtheir experience of creating them in interviews either every week or at the end of the two weeks.In each study, the photo diary proved to be a useful tool for supporting the participants’explorations of their presentation and embodied identities, but none of these studies presented intheir results the effect the practice of keeping a photo diary may have had on the participants.Photo diaries have been used therapeutically with a wide variety of populations aroundthe world, in both clinical and community settings (Kinney and Brandon-Friedman, 2021). Aresearch project with transgender participants in San Francisco (Barbee, 2002) found that “forpersons whose gender expression was outside of mainstream gender roles, being seen wasimportant and their process of expression was often documented and confirmed withphotography\" (Kinney & Brandon-Friedman, 2021, p.341). Photography supported theparticipants in developing a sense of agency and legitimacy in their self-presentation (Kinney &Brandon-Friedman, 2021). Kinney and Brandon-Friedman (2021) explained that the photo diaryRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 30functions therapeutically by allowing the photographer to create an artificial environment inwhich the photographer feels comfortable and enabling the photographer to share thatenvironment with others. The photo diary allows photographers to highlight and contextualizecertain aspects of identity which might be missed in dynamic interactions (Kinney &Brandon-Friedman, 2021). The photo diary supports the photographer and the observer increating a more nuanced understanding of the image content through their collaborativeinterpretation (Kinney & Brandon-Friedman, 2021). Finally, the photo diary provides reflectivedistance which supports clients in feeling safe to discuss intimate details of their experience(Kinney & Brandon-Friedman, 2021). Kinney and Brandon-Friedman (2021) emphasized thepotential for the photo diary to capture intersectional complexities of clients’ identities, includingevolutions of various identities over time, and recommended that practitioners educatethemselves on best practices when working with specific minority populations in order toethically support clients’ work with photo diaries.Kinney and Brandon-Friedman (2021) framed the photo diary as homework to occurbetween sessions. The client brings a self-portrait photo into the next session along with a title ora brief narrative about the image. The therapist asks questions about the image such as, “Whatdoes your portrait photo say about you? What does the title mean to you?... How do you feelwhen looking at this photo of yourself?... What emotions are being shown in this picture? Werethese intentional? What do you want others to think when they see you as you are in this photo?\"(Kinney and Brandon-Friedman, 2021, p.344). Kinney and Brandon-Friedman (2021)highlighted the importance of mirroring the client’s language during this discussion, not onlywith pronouns and identity-related terms, but also in response to the client’s use of first or thirdperson to talk about the person in the image. The authors also cautioned the therapist to be alertRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 31to any verbal or physical cues of gender dysphoria or intense emotional reactions: if these arise,the therapist should pause the experiential to process the emotions. Kinney andBrandon-Friedman (2021) recommended creating one photo every one-to-three months. Aftercreating the second and subsequent photos, the authors recommended that the client write a fewsentences about any changes they have noticed in their identity since they created the previousimage. The authors suggested creating a book to contain all the self-portraits, titles, and progressnarratives. Kinney and Brandon-Friedman (2021) warned that this photo diary experiential iscontraindicated for clients with “severe gender dysphoria or fixation on physical appearance,including those with eating disorders,” as increased self-awareness of the client’s appearancemay exacerbate these conditions (p.345). They wrote, “This activity should only be used withinthe bounds of an established therapeutic relationship and with a client who has built up resilienceand partially accepted and integrated their gender identity\" (Kinney & Brandon-Friedman,2021, p.346).Inside Me/Outside Me. Pelton-Sweet and Sherry (2008) recommended Makin’s (2000)“Inside Me, Outside Me” art therapy intervention for LGBTQ+ clients. Citing these authors,Kimbrough (2020) recommended Makin’s (2000) intervention specifically for LGBTQ+ ruralemerging adults. The intervention involves creating portraits of the inner and outer self, whichmay be constructed on the inside and outside of a box, or on two sides of a mask. Pelton-Sweetand Sherry (2008) observed that these two images may be quite different for people who areearly in their coming-out journeys (p.173). This may be interesting as a repeated interventionwith long-term clients to see how the inner self and outward presentation evolve in relationshipto one another over time. Pelton-Sweet and Sherry (2008) explained that self-portraiture is a“means for externalizing feelings and qualities of the self that are too delicate to expose verbally\"Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 32(p.173). While any materials can be used, Kimbrough (2020) suggested that collage usingmagazines that include queer imagery can provide opportunities for identifying with imagery thatrural clients may have had little access to. Kimbrough (2020) reflected that the inside me/outsideme experiential can be particularly useful for rural LGBTQ+ clients because it may supportclients in accessing and processing internalized homophobia.Hairvolutions. Cole Parke-West (2013), a queer community organizer and conflictmediation specialist, created a personal arts-based project in which they asked over one hundredparticipants with diverse identities to draw the evolution of their hairstyles. Parke-West collected“hairvolution” images over the course of two years and documented them in photographs ontheir blog, https://hairvolutions.wordpress.com/. (My own hairvolution is #71 in the blog.) Theproject was informal, often presented as a fun group activity in the context of existing socialgatherings. Parke-West presented each participant with a small rectangle of brown cardboardwith four pre-drawn ovals placed side-by-side. Then Parke-West invited participants to decorateeach head to depict a different phase in their personal “hairvolution.” Participants were free tochoose any four points in time, and Parke-West encouraged participants to consider how changesin hairstyle related to changes in identity. Some participants labeled each head with the age theywere at the time of the hairstyle. Many participants added notes about their identity at the time,and factors that had influenced each hairstyle. When the participants were finished, Parke-Westinvited them to share their images with each other and discuss how their hair related totheir identity.In the “Why” section of their blog, Parke-West (2013) discussed the need forconversations about identity in order to facilitate self-understanding as well as culturalappreciation and compassion for others. Parke-West wrote that authentic conversations aboutRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 33identity which highlight both similarities and differences of experience are an antidote toignorance, fear, and violence. Parke-West explained that direct questions about identity andculture can be experienced as invasive or otherizing, but in their experience, asking about haircan serve as an accessible entry point to these conversations. From an expressive arts therapylens, the use of a small piece of plain brown cardboard with pre-drawn ovals and familiar writingutensils makes this intervention accessible to participants who don’t consider themselves artists.While this intervention has not been studied in clinical settings, its utility in facilitatingconversations around presentation and intersectional identity in community-based social justicesettings suggests that it may be a helpful entry point into clinical discussions of self-presentation.Expressive Writing with Rural LGBTQ+ Adults. Over the course of several months ofsearching through Google Scholar and the Lesley Library, I was able to identify exactly oneempirical study on the use of an expressive therapy intervention with rural LGBTQ+ adults.Pachankis et al. (2020) created and tested the efficacy of two online self-guided writinginterventions aimed at improving the mental health of “geographically dispersed” sexualminority populations living in “high-stigma, low-resource” environments (p.430). Theresearchers developed and tested the interventions in Appalachian Tennessee. In consultationwith ten sexual minority young adults and ten stakeholders, Pachankis et al. (2020) developedone intervention focused on expressive writing and another focused on self-affirmation. Theresearchers then tested the intervention with 108 sexual minority young adults living in sixcounties with high structural stigma against LGBTQ+ identities and with fewLGBTQ+ resources.Pachankis et al. (2020) recruited participants through a wide variety of internet- andcommunity-based methods both related and unrelated to LGBTQ+ identities. The participantsRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 34came from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds and held a variety of LGBTQ+ identities.Most were white and most had been assigned female at birth, with just over half currentlyidentifying as women. The participants were randomly assigned into three groups; the first groupreceived a three-session expressive writing intervention, the second received a self-affirmationintervention, and the third group wrote about daily events as a neutral control. Participantsreceived email links to access the appropriate online writing intervention and had to completeeach session in order to access the next session the following day. Participants completed a seriesof measures at baseline, directly after the intervention, and three weeks later. These includedseven established measures of mental health and behavioral risk and two established measures ofminority stress to identify contextual moderators. Pachankis et al. (2020) analyzed continuousoutcomes and count outcomes separately using linear mixed models with maximum likelihoodestimation. For the data on moderated effects, they performed simple slopes analysis to check forthree-way interactions among Condition, Time, and Moderator.Comparing baseline and three-month measures between the expressive writing group andthe control, Pachankis et al. (2020) found improvements in depression (d=0.48) andpsychological distress (0.36). Comparing the self-affirmation group to the control, they foundimprovement in suicidal ideation (d=0.41) and drug use (d=0.59). Participants with greaterminority stress exposure showed significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms than thecontrol group three months after participating in either writing intervention. Those whoexperienced greater minority stress also showed significantly greater reduction in suicidality thanthe control three months after participating in the self-affirmation intervention.Pachankis et al. (2020) included a high level of detail both in the data they collected andin their justification for methodological choices, which supports the validity of this study. One ofRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 35the greatest strengths of this study, moreover, is that the researchers’ recruitment methods gobeyond the typical strategies for studies of LGBTQ+ issues (LGBTQ+ organization listservs,snowball sampling) to reach participants who may not have been previously connected withLGBTQ+ community or resources. While Pachankis et al. (2020) used some familiar methodslike recruiting through gay-straight alliances at local schools, the majority of their recruitmentstrategies were focused on the local community at large (geographically targeted Facebook ads,in-person announcements and flyers at local businesses and community events, etc.). It’snecessary for studies researching rural LGBTQ+ populations to target the general community forrecruitment because isolation from LGBTQ+ organizations and other LGBTQ+ people isfrequently one of the issues under study. Yet this is an area where most studies fall short, and oneeffect of this oversight is confirmation of metronormative bias. Pachankis et al’s (2020) duediligence in the recruitment process allowed them to connect with participants whoseperspectives are needed precisely because they are so hard to find.Rural queer theory provides valuable context for expressive arts therapy practice withLGBTQ+ clients in rural areas. The clinician must develop awareness of their ownmetronormative bias, and critically analyze how metronormative bias may affect the research andrecommendations they draw from to develop their practice. Embodiment is a groundingcomponent of expressive arts therapy. Understanding how LGBTQ+ clients experience theirembodied identities in daily life can provide insight into ethical and supportive ways the clinicianmight utilize body-centered interventions with these clients. Experientials which focus on theclient self-articulating identity are particularly important for rural LGBTQ+ populations, sincethese populations comprise a wide variety of experiences which are frequently misunderstoodand oversimplified by metronormative bias in both research and media.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 36Culturally competent practice in rural areas requires a commitment to understanding ruralLGBTQ+ adults’ stories on their own terms. Some rural LGBT people have no need of acoming-out narrative because they see sexuality as a private matter and other aspects of theiridentity, such as their roles in the community, are much more central to their identity(Schweighofer, 2016). This makes sense in the context of Little and Leyshon’s (2003) analysis ofhow the rural body is typically desexualized, even in the context of dating. If even references toheterosexuality are kept out of the public sphere, “out and proud” may feel like an answer to aquestion no one is asking. If a queer person finds belonging in their rural community through amultitude of roles and relationships, highlighting sexuality may unnecessarily emphasizedifference. The clinician must be open to the possibility that each person has their ownexperience of how different factors inform their identity and their own valid preferences aroundhow they choose to be witnessed.DiscussionBest practices for LGBTQ+ clients in rural areas in particular have yet to be defined andapplying metronormative best practices to rural LGBTQ+ populations may not be adequate.Research on rural LGBTQ+ populations shows mixed results. The lens of rural queer theoryshows that although rural LGBTQ+ people may be more vulnerable to certain risk factors thanurban LGBTQ+ populations, it’s not clear that they fare worse overall. The experience ofLGBTQ+ people depends a great deal on understudied factors like intersectionality and regionalculture, and evidence shows that living in a rural setting amplifies LGBTQ+ people’s experienceof both rejection and acceptance. Research on rural LGBTQ+ populations has often emphasizedthe importance of social support to mediate the psychological risk factors of holding a minorityidentity while living in a rural area. However, studies have typically conceived of social supportRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 37for LGBTQ+ people as being limited specifically to interactions with other LGBTQ+ people ororganizations. Rural queer theorists’ explanations of what intersectionality may look like forrural LGBTQ+ adults, along with studies’ failure to consistently show lower psychologicalwell-being despite lack of contact with LGBTQ+ community, suggest that rural LGBTQ+ adultsare likely to conceive of social support and their identities in more expansive ways than researchframed by metronormative bias can capture. So while psychosocial risk factors like thoseidentified by Rickard and Yancey (2018) may indeed help clinicians recognize opportunities tobolster the well-being of rural LGBTQ+ clients, it’s extremely important that treatment goals arecreated collaboratively and that clinicians working with these populations take extra care tounderstand clients’ perspectives within their specific cultural context. Some conventionalwisdom for working with LGBTQ+ clients may be contraindicated in a rural setting, such asencouraging higher levels of LGBTQ+ identity disclosure (Giano et. al., 2020).It’s important that expressive arts therapy with rural LGBTQ+ adults takes an activelyintersectional approach, even and especially when diverse identities are not visible to theclinician. Studies show that intersectional identity factors have a great deal of influence over howLGBTQ+ identities are received by rural communities, and this may include family andcommunity-based identity factors which are more salient in small towns than in large cities(Schweighofer, 2016). Research also demonstrates that rural LGBTQ+ clients may notexperience “LGBTQ+-affirming” spaces as affirming them, unless therapists actively invitediscussion of clients’ other intersectional identities (Hulko & Hovanes, 2018). A common themein the literature I reviewed on how LGBTQ+ people experience their identity is the resistance orambivalence many LGBTQ+ people feel about positioning LGBTQ+ identity as more importantthan other identities.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 38Studies show that each identity group within the LGBTQ+ umbrella has uniqueexperiences related to how they embody their identities. Rural cultural context adds specificlayers to embodied experience as well. Understanding some of the historical discourse aroundembodiment for each of these identity groups can aid the clinician in guiding expressive artsinterventions with these populations in a sensitive and attuned way. While each client isdifferent, it can be helpful to understand how dominant culture, rural culture, and queersubcultures tend to shape how LGBTQ+ people experience their bodies and identities. With thiscontext, expressive arts therapy can support positive experiences of embodiment related to eachclient’s unique identity.I have collected five expressive arts experientials which the literature supports forfostering positive experiences of embodiment with LGBTQ+ populations. Since empiricalstudies on arts-based therapy with LGBTQ+ populations are still scarce, I have reviewedempirical research on how LGBTQ+ people (in rural areas, when possible) experienceembodiment in their daily lives as a way to contextualize the application of expressive artstherapy through the experientials authors have recommended for these populations. Bodymapping and body tracing support exploration of embodied identity and experience whilecentering the client’s agency in how their bodies and stories are defined. Photo diaries allowclients to capture specific moments of embodied experience, track their self-presentation acrosstime and a variety of contexts, and curate images of the self which can show great complexitywhile also highlighting specific aspects of identity that may be lost during dynamic interactions.The inside me/outside me experiential, which may use a variety of materials including collageand may take the form of a box or mask, supports clients’ reflections on which parts of theiridentity they show, which parts they hide, how they believe others see them, and the level ofRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 39congruence they feel between their inner and outer selves. Hairvolutions is a community-basedactivist arts practice for facilitating conversations about cultural identity, personal history,presentation, and intersectionality, which shows promise as an expressive arts interventionbecause it has been shown to be an accessible entry point into these conversations for a widevariety of populations including those with low artistic confidence. Finally, online self-guidedexpressive writing and self-affirmation interventions are accessible and scalable togeographically dispersed LGBTQ+ clients and have been shown to improve measures ofdepression, psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and drug use.The literature supports the use of groups centered around specific queer identities ratherthan a spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities for lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender/nonbinary clients,but not for gay men. The research shows that LGBTQ+ umbrella spaces tend to be focusedaround gay men and that lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender/nonbinary people may feelmarginalized or even unsafe in these collective identity spaces. For these latter identity groups,research shows that positive experiences of embodiment often result from the rare opportunity toexperience an identity-specific space. A large body of literature shows stringent norms ofphysical appearance to be a feature of gay male subculture which frequently interrupts gay men’spositive experiences of embodiment. Therefore, groups for gay men may not be advisable whenexploring embodied identity unless specific attention is given to deconstructing body norms fromthe broader gay male subculture and intentionally co-creating a safe place for positiveexperiences of embodiment. Clients who identify more strongly with other aspects of theiridentity than with gender identity or sexual orientation may do well in groups centered aroundthese more salient identities.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 40Piran (2016) developed a framework for understanding positive experiences ofembodiment comprising five dimensions: body connection and comfort, agency andfunctionality, experience and expression of desire, attuned self-care, and inhabiting the body as asubjective site. These dimensions can help expressive arts therapists identify opportunities forsupporting clients’ positive experiences of embodied identity through the arts. Studies onembodiment and LGBTQ+ identities suggest that positive experiences of embodiment aresupported by acceptance and development of one’s LGBTQ+ identity (Yost & Chmielewski,2011; Huttunen et al., 2019). Some evidence also suggests that negative experiences ofembodiment may decrease a person’s level of comfort with their queer identity (Duncan, 2010).High levels of congruence among a person’s sense of self, their gender identity, and theiroutward presentation correlate with higher levels of life satisfaction, lower levels of anxiety anddepressive symptoms, and lower levels of body dissatisfaction (Kozee et al., 2012). Piran (2016)recommended that therapy incorporate the development of attuned self-care practices,identification of meaningful passions to engage in, and “immersion in joyful physical activities''as a means to increase clients’ experience of positive embodiment (p.59).Several studies have shown the use of voice to be a powerful physical and metaphoricalway to engage a person’s sense of self. Voice can also be an important aspect of how peoplepresent their gender identities and sexual orientations. Expressive arts interventions may playwith physical and metaphorical aspects of voice in order to deepen a client’s embodiedexperience of their identity and agency.Literature on creative therapies with LGBTQ+ clients tends to be framed in terms ofremediating a deficiency of authentic self-expression in the clients’ daily lives due toLGBTQ+-related oppression. This was also my framing as I began my thesis project, and IRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 41expected lack of opportunities for self-expression to be particularly pronounced for LGBTQ+clients living in rural areas. However, the lens of rural queer theory (Schweighofer, 2016;Thomsen, 2021) reveals that rural LGBTQ+ adults do not necessarily conceptualize theiridentities, or their needs around expressing queer identity specifically, in the same ways thatmetronormative queer theory delineates these issues. It is important for expressive arts therapistsworking with this population to check the implicit biases they may hold around rural LGBTQ+adults and self-expression. Instead of approaching this population with paternalistic fantasiesabout using the arts to provide these clients with their first experiences of authenticself-expression, the clinician should be open to the idea that for rural LGBTQ+ adults, as withmany populations, the arts provide opportunities to explore issues of embodiment in deep andnuanced ways that complement the ways these dimensions of identity show up in everyday life.While some rural LGBTQ+ adults may indeed lack opportunities in their daily lives to embodyand express their authentic identities, the clinician should not assume this as a given. Expressivearts therapists working with rural LGBTQ+ adults must carefully co-create with clients theirunderstandings of what embodiment of identity means in the context of each client’s life as abasis for collaborative treatment planning.Although some instructional chapters and resource books exist on the topic of usingcreative therapies with LGBTQ+ clients, searches of Google Scholar and the Lesley Librarydatabase turn up very few empirical studies on the effectiveness of expressive arts interventionswith LGBTQ+ populations. Studies using arts-informed methods to research another topicaffecting LGBTQ+ populations, while still scarce, are far more common. Two resources areubiquitous on reference lists related to creative therapies with LGBTQ+ clients: Pelton-Sweetand Sherry’s (2008) article, “Coming Out Through Art: A Review of Art Therapy With LGBTRunning head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 42Clients,” and Fraser and Waldman’s (2003) chapter, “Singing With Pleasure and Shouting withAnger: Working with Gay and Lesbian Clients in Art Therapy.” Neither of these resourcessupported their recommendations with empirical studies of creative therapy interventions withLGBTQ+ populations, likely because no such studies existed. These authors’ recommendationsare based on anecdotes from their own counseling careers (in the case of Fraser and Waldman)and on assumptions about what must be at the forefront of LGBTQ+ clients’ experiences, likePelton-Sweet and Sherry’s (2008) recommendation of certain experientials because they are“ideally suited for clients struggling with identity\" (p.173). Clearly, empirical research to validatespecific expressive arts interventions with LGBTQ+ populations is direly needed and longoverdue. Studies on expressive therapies with rural LGBTQ+ populations are practicallynonexistent: Pachankis et al. (2020) was the only such study I could identify. The experiences ofrural LGBTQ+ adults are also understudied. Conflicting evidence on the psychological effects ofboth stressors and resources for these populations demonstrates a need for studies whichincorporate an understanding of intersectionality, regional culture, and rural queer theory. Inexecuting such studies, researchers must broaden their recruitment strategies beyond snowballsampling based on LGBTQ+ organization listservs, as this method selects for participants whoare likely to conceptualize themselves and their relationship to LGBTQ+ communities in waysthat align with metronormative ideology. Rural queer theory shows that other paradigms arepossible beyond the single story of the repressed gay person in the small town. Whether intherapy or in research, the expressive arts offer boundless tools to articulate these stories.Running head: EMBODIMENT, RURAL LGBTQ+ 43ReferencesAdichie, C. N. (2009).

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the use of expressive arts therapy to support LGBTQ+ adult clients in rural communities. Caring professionals in rural areas often lack training on how to work with LGBTQ+ clients, and best practices for clinical mental health counseling with rural LGBTQ+ clients have yet to be defined. Some evidence suggests that using “metronormative” best practices with rural clients may be irrelevant or cause harm (Giano et al., 2020). Although some recommendations exist for using expressive therapies with LGBTQ+ clients, they are rarely evidence-based, as very few empirical studies exist evaluating the effectiveness of expressive therapy interventions with LGBTQ+ populations. To address these gaps in the research, I use the lenses of rural queer theory and embodiment (a key component of expressive arts therapy) to explore how LGBTQ+ clients may experience their identities within a rural community context. I review empirical studies on LGBTQ+ embodiment, and the work of two rural queer theory scholars, to contextualize how a therapist might implement expressive arts interventions ethically with rural LGBTQ+ clients. I describe five expressive arts interventions which show promise for supporting rural LGBTQ+ adults in cultivating positive experiences of embodiment. Expressive arts therapy’s emphasis on embodiment may be useful to clients who experience oppression on the basis of sexuality and/or gender identity. Expressive arts therapy supports clients in articulating their own identities and stories, which is important because rural LGBTQ+ adults may conceptualize their identities using a different paradigm than the one that is dominant in mainstream media, queer theory, and LGBTQ+ activism",
