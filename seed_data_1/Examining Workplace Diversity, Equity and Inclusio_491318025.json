Examining Workplace Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) With The COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework Abstract Efforts to protect marginalized and minority groups from workplace discrimination go back decades. With the increase of social turmoil in America, many organizations faced the urgent need for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Therefore, the problem addressed in this grounded theory quantitative study was the lack of research that examined whether positive mechanisms such as the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework influenced climates of equity and inclusion within organizations. To do so, the primary focus was on the demographics of the population surveyed and produced results that reflected the correlation between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework among corporate employees and among corporate workplaces. This quantitative grounded theory study determined whether relationships exist between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework among corporate employees and among corporate workplaces. Although a relationship was found between the independent and the dependent variables, causation was not determined. This study successfully met the purpose of the research and provided practical information for organizations and corporate leaders and management practitioners. Based on this study’s results, inclusion coaching should concentrate on areas of negative correlation. In contrast, there were several areas of positive correlation that should be reinforced in the workplace. The significance and social change implication is that organizational leaders and corporate executives could use the results of this study to expand DEI policies and programs that leverage full range inclusion among minority and marginalized employees to address the new reality of supporting the increasingly global workforce.

Even though a previous study declared that now more than ever, diversity and inclusion are critical topics in workplaces around the world (Grissom, 2018). Other researchers proposed that future research should systematically examine, for instance, specific positive mechanisms that may promote climates of organizational egalitarianism and inclusion (Warren, Donaldson, Lee & Donaldson, 2019). Therefore, the problem addressed in this grounded theory quantitative study was the lack of research that examined whether positive mechanisms such as the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework influenced climates of equity and inclusion within organizations. The purpose of this grounded theory quantitative study was to examine whether the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework influenced workplace inclusion and equity - the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. With the increase of social turmoil in America, many organizations faced the urgent need for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The necessity for transparency became increasingly damaging to organizations that failed to implement DEI in corporate coaching techniques. In the early 1980s, the idea of going beyond lip service was first introduced (Albers, 1989). As a professional inclusion coach, I introduced a new grounded theory of conceptual framework for inclusive professional coaching detailed in this article. The urgency for incorporating DEI in organizational coaching is evident from years of results that originate from implementing inclusion coaching in organizations.          The conceptual framework of this grounded theory quantitative study was designed to introduce the tenets of the newly proposed COMMIT Inclusive Behavioral Framework (Harris, 2019). Therefore, the nature of the study used an author-based instrument COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework (Harris, 2019). To do so, the primary focus was on the demographics of the population surveyed and produced results that reflected the correlation between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework among corporate employees and among corporate workplaces. To justify the premise of this study, the background to the previous identified problem statement was researched through an exhaustive literature review.          As previously stated, the interpretation of the study's findings guided the grounded theory which developed the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. This research aimed to present a new conceptual framework that included introspection of employees, managers, leaders, and professional coaches to explore how DEI can be embedded into coaching conversations. Therefore, the implication of increased self-awareness and personal accountability will become apparent when the effects of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework promote organizational diversity, workplace inclusion along with greater employee equity. Next, the literature review section elaborated on the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace. Literature Review Background          The idea of providing a more inclusive, diverse, and psychologically safe working environment is not a new concept. In the past several decades, many organizations provided diversity, equity, and inclusion training for corporate employees. However, the sentiment has often led to lip service—the notion of saying the organizations will become more diverse, equitable and inclusive. Yet, there is still a lack of substantive DEI progress in many companies.  The American workforce became more diversified following the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which led to an increased middle-class minority presence (Calderon, Fouka & Tabellini, 2021; Chervenak, Asfaw, Shaktman & McCullough, 2017; Grissom, 2018; Zugelder & Champagne, 2018). An inclusive behavioral approach to professional coaching that employed DEI as a foundation by introducing reflective inquiry and cultural curiosity and humility. (Harris, 2019). Researchers sought to understand professional coaching best practices to ensure employees felt supported and included, free from discrimination (Fine, 1996; Harris, 2019; Harris, 2020). In sum, to ensure equitable and inclusive employee experiences in organizations, organizations were challenged to consider alternative conceptual perspectives, critical theories, and sociological paradigms for problem identification and assigned methodologies appropriate to future diversity studies. An exhaustive literature review evaluated the problem of the lack of DEI in professional coaching. The literature search yielded four central themes: diversity, equity and inclusion; inclusion coaching; diversity in the workplace; and going beyond lip service. Articles were captured for synthesis and supported the new COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework          conceptual framework. Many articles were incorporated to lament the lack of a coaching model        that included an inside-out coaching approach. Additionally, fields of study included academia and business which sought to understand the concept of organizations that failed to go beyond lip service and implement inclusion coaching conversations. Diversity and Inclusion           While America's social turmoil continues, many organizations fight to avoid \"business as usual\" to avoid the backlash of cancel culture. During the sweeping protests following George Floyd's murder, many traditional businesses that had not previously addressed systemic racism publicly began to speak out to condemn racism and police brutality. Organizations and leaders were not adequately equipped to facilitate these discussions with corporate employees.   Many minority employees openly called out racism within individual institutions via social media (Hecht, 2020). On this critical issue, neither consumers nor employees looked for vague platitudes about change; instead wanted to see companies committed to action to improve the lived experience of marginalized populations in and outside of the workplace. The benefits and costs of a diversity, and inclusion program were quantified as accurately as possible and were usually categorized as either tangible (measurable in monetary terms) or intangible (subjective and not measurable in monetary terms) (Morley, 2018). According to Liswood (2009), understanding another’s viewpoint and cultural norms were essential in creating a more effective, inclusive workplace. Barak (2017) framed inclusion as the key to driving effective diversity management across organizations. She also covered diversity management not just in terms of corporate programs but also through the lens of international laws, policies, education, and economics. Brislin (2008) parsed through cultural differences from a psychological perspective, covering such topics as individualism, silence, gender differences, power, status, criticism, and social norms, among others. Measuring and effectively communicating the short- and long-term successes of diversity, equity and inclusion programs can help improve employers’ brand and recognition. Not to mention, achieving racial equity in the workplace will be one of the most important issues companies will tackle in the coming decade. This crucial need for social change led researchers to implement a more inclusive approach to professional coaching resulting in a new coaching paradigm— inclusion coaching. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the Workplace Globalization and the increase in workplace diversity resulted in an increased need to understand how to coach employees with different backgrounds (Coultas et al., 2011). Based on these trends in America, it became imperative for organizations to ensure that middle and top-level leaders were adequately equipped to lead, support and coach diverse populations. The organization, Diversity Best Practices, offered excellent primers covering all aspects of diversity program management; Diversity Primer (2009), Global Diversity Primer (2015), and HR Executive Diversity Primer (2016)—however such resources were only made available to corporate members (Grissom, 2018). According to Morley (2018), tangible benefits included having a diverse workplace that allowed organizations to more effectively market, better serve and communicate to consumer groups from different cultures, races and religious backgrounds, which in turn had the propensity to lead to increased sales and profits and access to a more diverse market. Intangible benefits were described by Morley as fair treatment which was important to employees, and a diverse workforce that made an employer more attractive to investors and improved the organization’s public image. Information professionals were not only expected to support inclusive practices in the recruitment, hiring, and retention of diverse colleagues within the field (American Library Association, 2012). The authors further declared that professionals must also advocate for inclusion in the delivery of their day-to-day work, including organizational approaches to customer service, collection development, programs, academic freedom, and diversity of thought. Herring and Henderson (2014) noted that a diverse workforce had real, measurable benefits for the bottom line and made a business more competitive than its peers. Diversity and inclusion improved corporate top lines along with business success of daily operations. The magazine, DiversityInc’s Top 50 Companies for Diversity, listed corporations based on performance in four areas: talent pipeline, talent development, leadership accountability, and supplier diversity (Grissom, 2018). All in all, research underpins the importance of diverse, equitable and inclusive practices in the workplace. Moving Beyond Lip Service  In 2021, Skillsoft 360 Series hosted an online forum aptly named Leading Inclusively, How A Leadercamp Encouraged Meaningful Change, Within And Without among thousands of participants to discuss DEI in the workplace. Harris and Vincent led conversations that elaborated on discussions about the importance of how DEI words were not enough without the implementation of actionable change. Empirical data collected from the public forum captured below gave context and insight regarding the four quadrants of moving beyond lip service: Harris introduced the phases of DEI engagement along the continuums of  commitment and care. She’s found in her research in organizations that most people fall into one of four quadrants relative to their engagement in DEI work — compliance, apathy, champion, and lip service. Leaders that operate in the  compliance quadrant focus on getting the work done and meeting metric  benchmarks. However, often their driving ambition is EEOC or some form of legal requirement. They may not necessarily have the care and concern for the human element that is the heart of DEI work. Leaders in the apathy quadrant exhibit a low level of care and commitment relative to DEI and present as the strongest resisters to progress. Champions bring a high level of care and commitment for DEI to their  organizations and often take the lead in advancing inclusivity. Leaders in the lip service quadrant are not as straightforward as the others.  “That’s why my mantra is ‘diversity beyond lip service’ because when you go deeper with these leaders, they usually say all the right things, and in their heart, they  really do care about diversity, equity, and inclusion,” Harris explains. “It’s just that they don’t have the corresponding level of commitment. In the workplace, this looks like leaders who say things like, ‘I’m on board.’ ‘I’m here to help.’ ‘I believe in DEI.’ All of these things sound good, but with lip service, they don’t necessarily back it up with a budget allocation or they don’t put forth a true FTE (Full Time Equivalent). They often view DEI as a voluntary ‘add on’ to someone’s job  responsibilities. And therefore, they present an intriguing conundrum — these leaders care, but they’re not committed.” Ultimately, the identification of where leaders are on the care and commitment continuum is meant to serve as a point of understanding to enable greater  connection and adaptability. Understanding where we all are on our journey helps inform how we get the work done with efficiency and efficacy. (Skillsoft, 2021) Inclusion Coaching  Inclusion coaching involves changing the mindset of organizational personnel mindsets. In fact, there are two types of mindsets; (1) the fixed mindset which referred to a person who believed that a person’s basic attributes, such as intelligence and talents, were unchangeable, and (2) the growth mindset which referred to a person with a growth and changeable mindset who believed that all everyone’s attributes were changeable due to efforts and accumulated experiences, such as a person’s notions, beliefs, attitudes, values, and knowledge, depending on environment and society (Dweck, 2006). Subsequently, the onus of proper coaching relied on the knowledge and etiquette of the inclusion coach. To be clear, the coaching process from learning to change incorporated a process of changing the mindset of instruction for practitioners by learned experiences, thorough thinking, best practices, and interaction between practitioners and relevant parties (Kawinkamolroj, Triwaranyu & Thongthew, 2015).  However, the onus of DEI implementation from words to actionable items ultimately relied upon the organizational leaders’ shoulders. In many cases, there was a lack of policy and procedure that adequately managed instances of overt and covert racist aggressions (Lorde, 2018). To this end, organizations dealt with penalties and lawsuits since employers failed to admonish aggressors, address racist incidents, and strive for a fair and equitable work environment for all employees (Lorde). That is why the effects of inclusion coaching must move beyond quality instruction.  Organization leaders should develop policies that deter and prevent said behavior that negatively impacts the top line. With many policies changing to address increasingly diverse and inclusive populations, there was still little empirical evidence of professional coaching paradigms that included diversity and inclusion. Hence the implementation of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework to professional coaching (Harris 2019). In 2020, as a researcher, I continued to add to the extant literature on diversity and inclusion within a professional paradigm. Inclusion coaching, considering recent history, became significantly warranted. Especially when racist outbursts in the corporate workplace, or from corporate employees outside the workplace, were filmed and landed many individuals and organizations in compromised situations. Although diversity, equity and inclusion were not new concepts, it became increasingly necessary to go beyond lip service to ensure all persons were treated respectfully, equitably and felt supported and included. Conceptual Framework Grounded Theory Glasser (2008) explained how theory could be generated from data inductively. Glasser also stated, during a full monograph on quantitative grounded theory, that qualitative and quantitative data may be used separately or together when conducting a grounded theory study. Grounded theory set out to discover or construct theory from data, systematically obtained and analysed using comparative analysis (Chun Tie, Birks & Francis, 2019). This concept was the foundation for the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. According to Harrapa Educaion (2021) grounded theory was often used by HR departments who studied why employees were frustrated by individual work and listened to the explanations about what was lacking. To this end, HR then gathered this data, examined the results to discover the root cause of employee problems and presented solutions (Harrapa Education). For this reason, the six inclusive behavioral dimensions of professional coaching tenets presented within the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework was quintessential to this study. The next section explained the six tenets in depth. COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework  The COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework’s six tenets along with the explanation of the five descriptive characteristics applied to each tenet provided an in-depth illustration listed below.   Figure 1. COMMIT Flow Diagram  1) COMMIT TO COURAGEOUS ACTION ● I am committed to taking action to improve inclusion. ● I ensure that all voices are included when setting goals and building action plans. ● I take a collaborative approach and consider diverse ways of learning, working, and leading when setting objectives. ● I apply a D&I lens when identifying and evaluating key metrics, including qualitative and quantitative data. ● I consider the cultural impact on my team, organization, and society when making decisions.           2) OPEN YOUR EYES AND EARS ● I practice deep listening with an empathetic presence to build connections with others. ● I recognize and manage my own blind spots, biases, and limiting beliefs. ● I consider and address stereotypes that can affect work assignments and environments. ● I maintain a zero- tolerance policy when confronted with oppressive, exclusionary, or prejudiced behavior. ● I recognize that privilege and systemic biases affect policies, hiring, succession planning, and promotions.  1) MOVE BEYOND LIP SERVICE ● I solicit feedback from people with different cultures, backgrounds, and thought processes. ● I lead with courage and initiate actions or conversations about inclusion at all levels of the managerial hierarchy. ● I lead by example by using my power and influence to champion diversity and inclusion, and encourage my peers to do the same. ● I help create an environment in which others feel comfortable expressing their wholeness, and no one has to hide a part of themselves to \"fit in.\" ● I advocate for inclusion as a corporate value and core leadership competency.          2) MAKE ROOM FOR CONTROVERSY AND CONFLICT ● I encourage accountability for inclusion at my organization—from every individual, at every level, every day. ● I lean into my fear and discomfort when faced with challenging situations.  ● I say no to requests that marginalize or exclude others. ● I approach conflict with humility and vulnerability and remain open to new information and insights. ● I consistently honor my values when faced with difficult or sensitive topics.  1) INVITE NEW PERSPECTIVES ● I seek to learn about cultures and backgrounds different from my own. ● I see every day as an opportunity to meet new people and learn more about my colleagues. ● I remain open to possibilities by constantly asking, \"What else is possible?\" ● I invite opposing thoughts and ideas when making decisions.        2) TELL THE TRUTH EVEN WHEN IT HURTS ● I am comfortable articulating the value of diversity, equity and inclusion for my organization. ● I consistently speak up for inclusivity with my team, while modeling inclusive behaviors. ● I speak the truth about DEI even when it may not be well received. ● I call out microaggressions and exclusionary behaviors. ● I ask open-ended questions to gain broader perspectives. ● I own my truth about where I am in my inclusion journey through self-reflection and feedback.   A conceptual framework is comprised of a researcher’s thoughts on identification of the research topic, the problem to be investigated, the questions to be asked, the literature to be reviewed, the theories to be applied, the methodology used, the methods, procedures and instruments, the data analysis and interpretation of findings, and researcher recommendations and conclusions (Ravitch & Riggan, 2017). Therefore, the conceptual framework was based on the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. The COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework entailed: (C) Commit to courageous action, (O) Open to your eyes, (M) Move beyond lip service, (M) Make room for controversy and conflict, (I) Invite new perspectives, and (T) Tell the truth even when it hurts. This COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework was presented globally to various organizations, DEI practitioners and subject matter experts, business leaders and employees to engage dialogue on incorporating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) from an inside-out approach to leadership coaching methods. The perspective on creating an inclusion coaching framework was presented for organizations to incorporate into leadership coaching practices. Historically speaking, there was no presented conceptual foundation for this inside-out inclusion coaching approach, that is why a grounded theory approach through a quantitative study was employed. The findings supported further exploration of the validity and reliability of the COMMIT Self-Assessment Survey. With this in mind, a thorough evaluation was given to the study methods that provided credence to the validity, reliability, transferability, and confirmability of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and COMMIT Self-Assessment Survey Likhert scale.  In tandem, this article highlights relevant excerpts from my 2019 book, Diversity Beyond Lip Service: A Coaching Guide for Challenging Bias. Moreover, an in-depth discussion about the methodology of data collection conducted for this study complemented the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework as evidence-based practices associated with professional inclusion coaching. Consequently, the conceptual framework of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework provided guidance to the analyses of the study. The intention of this article was to present a new approach to organizational  leadership coaching, which is significantly warranted in this evolutionary world. Diversity, equity and inclusion were the criteria that established the conceptual framework for the design of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. Therefore, applying this new conceptual framework through an inductive lens can help promote retention rates for many organizations during the global pandemic and beyond. The next topic elaborates upon the rationale of methodology used for this grounded theory quantitative study. Methodology The problem addressed in this grounded theory quantitative study was the lack of research that examined whether positive mechanisms such as inclusion coaching influenced climates of equity and inclusion within organizations. The purpose of this grounded theory quantitative study was to examine whether the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework influenced workplace inclusion and equity among corporate employees. Therefore, the overarching research question was what, if any, correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework among corporate employees and among corporate workplaces? The following research questions were addressed: What, if any, correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ race? What, if any, correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ age? What, if any, correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ gender? What, if any, correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ geographic location? What, if any, correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ corporate occupation?       H10: No correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and  corporate employees’ race.       H1a: A correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ race.       H20: No correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ age.       H2a: A correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ age.       H30: No correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ gender.       H3a: A correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ gender.       H40: No correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ geographic location.       H4a: A correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ geographic location.       H50: No correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ corporate occupation.      H5a: A correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ corporate occupation. The COMMIT Self-Assessment Survey (2019) was created to measure whether the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework was reliable and valid. The survey was administered to a diverse population of DEI practitioners and subject matter experts, business leaders and employees with various occupations. The COMMIT Self-Assessment Survey is available on an open source platform and free to use. Although the survey has over 8000 respondents, for the purposes of this study N=399 were analyzed with self-identified demographics. With respect to the 8000 respondents who have completed the survey to date, not all respondents attended Harris’ DEI training or coaching classes. On the other hand, participant recruitment involved corporate employees who attended Harris’ DEI training and inclusion coaching. Prior to the coaching or training sessions, participants voluntarily took the COMMIT Self-Assessment Survey from the researcher’s website at https://www.lawanaharris.com/assessment as pre-work to establish a baseline of knowledge.  The service agreement included a consent disclosure regarding survey participation. The COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework entailed: (C) Commit to courageous action, (O) Open to your eyes, (M) Move beyond lip service, (M) Make room for controversy and conflict, (I) Invite new perspectives, and (T) Tell the truth even when it hurts. Each of the six tenets consisted of data sets with 5 questions each. Data analysis involved average analysis, t-tests and ANOVA analysis, regression analysis with dummy variables which confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences between the data sets (Caporale & Plastun, 2019). Using a quantitative grounded theory approach, I found that the ANOVA statistical analysis was best to determine data significance among the provided data sets. Demographics were exclusively addressed in this study and encompassed race, age, gender, geographic location, and occupation. Below are the survey questions that were asked on a Likert scale of 1-5, whereas 1= Strongly Disagree, 2= Disagree, 3= Neutral, 4= Agree, and 5= Strongly Agree. For each of the six principles in COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework, five survey questions asked participants to rate individual knowledge on a scale of 1 to 5. Each question was designed to spark introspection from the random participants’ level of commitment to DEI in various organizations. The methodology of this quantitative grounded study involved two types of probability sampling. First, population-based stratified sampling was defined when the population was divided into separate groups called “strata” (such as ethnic groups) and a probability sample (often a simple random sample) was drawn from each stratum (Bornstein, Jager & Putnick, 2013). Second, cluster sampling occurred when the target population was divided into separate geographic groups called “clusters”, a simple random sample of clusters is selected from the population, and data collection was limited to those who fall within these randomly selected clusters (Bornstein et al., 2013). Furthermore, researchers relied on stratified sampling when a population’s characteristics were diverse and researchers wanted to ensure that every characteristic was properly represented in the sample (Scribbr, n.d.). For the purpose of this study, stratified sampling was used to examine the random population of corporate employees based on demographic elements: age, gender, occupation, and race. The cluster sampling method was used to analyze the random population in the selected geographic locations. According to (Bornstein et al., 2013 ), locating high numbers of those in underrepresented groups to participate in a study presented its own set of challenges. In fact, the sample size calculation was based on 95% confidence level, .5 standard deviation, and a margin of error (confidence interval) of +/- 5% equated to 385 needed respondents (Qualtrics, n.d.). As previously stated, this study consisted of N=399 participants. Subsequently, the necessary sample size was met for this study. The next section discussed the results of the study. Results  This quantitative grounded theory study determined whether relationships exist between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework among corporate employees and among corporate workplaces. The problem addressed was the lack of research that examined whether positive mechanisms such as inclusion coaching influenced climates of equity and inclusion within organizations. The purpose was to examine whether the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework influenced workplace inclusion and equity among corporate employees. The study’s results identified participants by demographic analysis and analyzed how each demographic correlated with each research question.  A total of 399 random respondent responses were selected for this study. With respect to the 8000 respondents who completed the survey to date, not all respondents attended Harris’ DEI training or coaching classes. On the other hand, participant recruitment involved corporate employees who attended Harris’ DEI training and inclusion coaching. Prior to the coaching or training sessions, participants voluntarily took the COMMIT Self-Assessment Survey from the researcher’s website at https://www.lawanaharris.com/assessment as pre-work to establish a baseline of knowledge.  The service agreement included a consent disclosure regarding survey participation. The COMMIT Self-Assessment Survey consisted of 30 items to measure six tenets of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. Also included were 5 items to measure demographic questions. Tables 1 through 5 represented the Descriptives. Table 1 identified the participants’ various occupations. ANOVA Data Analysis and Results  Research Question 1 The first research question was as follows: What, if any, correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ race?       H10: No correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ race.       H1a: A correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ race.  Table 1. Commit to Courageous Action Descriptive Race  A one-way between-groups analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate if a significant difference existed in the average of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework to corporate employees’ race. The difference was statistically insignificant at the p >0.05 on COMMIT inclusive behaviour framework: F (3, 459) = 1.310, p = 0.270.  Therefore, the null hypothesis that there was no significant difference that existed in the average of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework to corporate employees’ race was notrejected. It can be concluded that there was no significant difference that existed in the average of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework to corporate employees’ race in the population. Table 2.

Discussions The purpose was to examine whether the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework influenced workplace inclusion and equity among corporate employees. With many policies changing to address increasingly diverse and inclusive populations, there was still little empirical evidence of professional coaching paradigms that included diversity and inclusion. Even though a previous study declared that now more than ever, diversity and inclusion are critical topics in workplaces around the world (Grissom, 2018). Other researchers proposed that future research should systematically examine, for instance, specific positive mechanisms that may promote climates of organizational egalitarianism and inclusion (Warren, Donaldson, Lee & Donaldson, 2019). For this reason, the six inclusive behavioral dimensions of professional coaching tenets presented within the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework were analyzed in this study. Interpretation of the Findings Research Question 1 Research Question 1 inquired whether a statistically significant relationship existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ race. Null Hypothesis 1, which stated that no correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ race, was tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis. The analysis was repeated for each of the six tenet scores within The COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework.  Tell the truth even when it hurts. Black or African-American had a positive correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. This relationship was statistically significant. White had a negative correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. This relationship was statistically significant. Unfortunately, the imbalance based on race within the corporate culture was apparent in the study.  Research Question 2 Research Question 2 inquired whether a statistically significant relationship existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ age. Null Hypothesis 2, which stated that no correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ age, was tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis. The analysis was repeated for each of the six tenet scores within The COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. Make room for controversy and conflict. The age 30-39 had a negative correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. This relationship was statistically significant. Interestingly enough, Generation Y or Millennials had an adverse reaction to this tenet. Research Question 3 Research Question 3 inquired whether a statistically significant relationship existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ gender. Null Hypothesis 3, which stated that no correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ gender, was tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis. The analysis was repeated for each of the six tenet scores within The COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. As per the results, there was no statistically significant relationship that occurred based on gender. Research Question 4 Research Question 4 inquired whether a statistically significant relationship existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ geographic location. Null Hypothesis 4, which stated that no correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ geographic location, was tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis. The analysis was repeated for each of the six tenet scores within The COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. Move beyond lip service. The United States had a negative correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. This relationship was statistically significant. The other’s location had a negative correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. This relationship was statistically significant. According to the ANOVA results, It can be concluded that there was a significant difference that existed in the average of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework to corporate employees’ geographic location in the population. Research Question 5   Research Question 5 inquired whether a statistically significant relationship existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ corporate occupation. Null Hypothesis 5, which stated that no correlation existed between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework and corporate employees’ corporate occupation, was tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis. The analysis was repeated for each of the six tenet scores within The COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. Move beyond lip service. Scientists had negative correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. This relationship was statistically significant. This was a fascinating fact that could be attributed to the lack of inclusion within this industry. Tell the truth even when it hurts. Only Scientists had a negative correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework. This relationship was statistically significant. According to ANOVA results, it can be concluded that there was a significant difference that existed in the average of the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework to corporate employees’ occupation in the population. Limitations For the study to make a significant contribution to leadership and DEI literature, it is essential to recognize limitations. Although the study provided information useful to corporate organizations and executives, it has several limitations that could be addressed by changing or modifying the research design. The use of a correlational design was one delimitation challenge. The methodology, results, and discussions were also shared at length within the study limitation of the study. Although a relationship was found between the independent and the dependent variables, causation was not determined.  A second limitation of the study was the use of probability sampling, in which participants were randomly selected from many survey respondents. Although, the use of stratified and cluster random sampling was appropriate for this study since the purpose was to examine participants’ demographic characteristics among the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework among corporate employees. Recommendations for Future Research The current study contributes to the body of knowledge on organizations and corporate leaders; however, the limitations of the study affected the generalization of the findings.  Future research might consider specific industries such as the medical field, information systems, and criminal justice to examine or explore DEI and inclusion coaching. A limitation of this study was the use of a correlational study design. Correlational study designs do not provide strong evidence of cause and effect relationships. The strongest study design for showing cause and effect is a randomized controlled experimental study design. Another suggestion would be to duplicate this study using a similar population sample for qualitative purposes. Future research could use a qualitative exploration of DEI and inclusion coaching. Implications for Organizational Leaders and Social Change  The significance and social change implication is that organizational leaders and corporate executives could use the results of this study to expand DEI policies and programs that leverage full range inclusion among minority and marginalized employees to address the new reality of supporting the increasingly global workforce. The conceptual framework was proven effective among the participants of the study. Therefore, the results of this study could affect positive social change by providing organizations and corporate leaders with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework as a model that focuses on a person centered approach to effective leadership development.  Conclusion This study successfully met the purpose of the research and provided practical information for organizations and corporate leaders and management practitioners. The purpose of this grounded theory quantitative study was to examine whether the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework influenced workplace inclusion and equity among corporate employees. Based on this study’s results, inclusion coaching should concentrate on areas of negative correlation. For instance, the United States and other countries had a negative correlation to moving beyond lip service. However, Age ranges 20-29; 40-49; 50-59; 60-69; Black or African-American, and Male populations had a positive correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework tenet Commit to Courageous Action.  Age ranges 20-29; 40-49; 50-59; 60-69; Asian, Black or African-American, and Female populations had a positive correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework tenet Open Your Eyes and Ears. Age range 40-49, Black or African-American, Hispanic and Latino, and Female populations had a positive correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework tenet Move Beyond Lip Service. Age ranges 20-29; 40-49; 50-59; 60-69; Asian, and Black or African-American populations had a positive correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework tenet Make Room for Controversy and Conflict.  Age ranges 40-49; 50-59; 60-69; Asian, and Black or African-American populations had a positive correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework tenet Invite New Perspectives. Finally, Age ranges 20-29; 40-49; 50-59; 60-69; Asian, Black or African-American, and Hispanic or Latino populations had a positive correlation with the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework tenet Tell the Truth Even When It Hurts. Therefore, the research problem adequately addressed the lack of research that examined whether positive mechanisms such as inclusion coaching influenced climates of equity and inclusion within organizations.

Appendix A COMMIT Self-Assessment Survey COMMIT TO COURAGEOUS ACTION I am committed to taking action to improve inclusion. I ensure that all voices are included when setting goals and building action plans. I take a collaborative approach and consider diverse ways of learning, working, and leading when setting objectives. I apply a D&I lens when identifying and evaluating key metrics, including qualitative and quantitative data. I consider the cultural impact on my team, organization, and society when making decisions. OPEN YOUR EYES AND EARS I practice deep listening with an empathetic presence to build connections with others. I recognize and manage my own blind spots, biases, and limiting beliefs. I consider and address stereotypes that can affect work assignments and environments. I maintain a zero- tolerance policy when confronted with oppressive, exclusionary, or prejudiced behavior. I recognize that privilege and systemic biases affect policies, hiring, succession planning, and promotions. MOVE BEYOND LIP SERVICE I solicit feedback from people with different cultures, backgrounds, and thought processes. I lead with courage and initiate actions or conversations about inclusion at all levels of the managerial hierarchy. I lead by example by using my power and influence to champion diversity and inclusion, and encourage my peers to do the same. I help create an environment in which others feel comfortable expressing their wholeness, and no one has to hide a part of themselves to \"fit in.\" I advocate for inclusion as a corporate value and core leadership competency. MAKE ROOM FOR CONTROVERSY AND CONFLICT I encourage accountability for inclusion at my organization—from every individual, at every level, every day. I lean into my fear and discomfort when faced with challenging situations.  I say no to requests that marginalize or exclude others. I approach conflict with humility and vulnerability and remain open to new information and insights. I consistently honor my values when faced with difficult or sensitive topics. INVITE NEW PERSPECTIVES I seek to learn about cultures and backgrounds different from my own. I see every day as an opportunity to meet new people and learn more about my colleagues. I remain open to possibilities by constantly asking, \"What else is possible?\" I invite opposing thoughts and ideas when making decisions. I ask open-ended questions to gain broader perspectives. TELL THE TRUTH EVEN WHEN IT HURTS I am comfortable articulating the value of diversity, equity and inclusion for my organization. I consistently speak up for inclusivity with my team, while modeling inclusive behaviors. I speak the truth about DEI even when it may not be well received. I call out microaggressions and exclusionary behaviors. I own my truth about where I am in my inclusion journey through self-reflection and feedback.    ",

    "abstract": "Efforts to protect marginalized and minority groups from workplace discrimination go back decades. With the increase of social turmoil in America, many organizations faced the urgent need for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Therefore, the problem addressed in this grounded theory quantitative study was the lack of research that examined whether positive mechanisms such as the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework influenced climates of equity and inclusion within organizations. To do so, the primary focus was on the demographics of the population surveyed and produced results that reflected the correlation between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework among corporate employees and among corporate workplaces. This quantitative grounded theory study determined whether relationships exist between the COMMIT Inclusive Behavior Framework among corporate employees and among corporate workplaces. Although a relationship was found between the independent and the dependent variables, causation was not determined. This study successfully met the purpose of the research and provided practical information for organizations and corporate leaders and management practitioners. Based on this study’s results, inclusion coaching should concentrate on areas of negative correlation. In contrast, there were several areas of positive correlation that should be reinforced in the workplace. The significance and social change implication is that organizational leaders and corporate executives could use the results of this study to expand DEI policies and programs that leverage full range inclusion among minority and marginalized employees to address the new reality of supporting the increasingly global workforce",
