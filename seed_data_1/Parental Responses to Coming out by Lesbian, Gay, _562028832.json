The sample consisted of61 interviewees in a young cohort (ages 18–25),65 in a middle cohort (ages 35–42), and 29 inan older cohort (ages 52–59), in six ethnic/racialgroups.Results: Themes based on LGBQ+ people’saccounts indicated that parental responses var-ied with the degree of their a priori knowl-edge of respondents’ sexual identities (rangingfrom suspicion or certainty to surprise). Parentalappraisal was either lacking, negative, mixed, orpositive with accompanying silent, invalidating,1116 Journal of Marriage and Family 83 (August 2021): 1116–1133DOI:10.1111/jomf.12731Parental Responses to Coming out by LGBQ+ People 1117ambivalent, and validating responses, respec-tively. Validating responses from parents weremore often found in the youngest cohort, butinvalidating responses were frequent across allcohorts. LGBQ+ people in the oldest cohortwere more inclined to accept their parents beingnoncommunicative about sexuality in generaland also about sexual diversity.Conclusion: It is too early to state that comingout to parents has become easier. Harmony in theparent–child relationship after coming out andopen communication about sexual identities isregarded as desirable and yet it remains elusivefor many LGBQ+ people.Coming out, the process of identifying anddisclosing one’s sexual minority attraction toothers, and potentially identifying as lesbian,gay, bisexual, queer, or another nonheterosex-ual identification (LGBQ+), has interested fam-ily researchers, mental health clinicians, andresearchers since the 1970s (cf. Cass, 1979;Coleman, 1982). Coming out to parents is amajor part of the identification process in sex-ual minority identity development. Parents fulfilla crucial role in the psychosocial well-being oftheir children; their role is particularly salient inadolescence, the period characterized by devel-opment of both sexuality and identity, but con-tinues into adulthood and throughout life (Bray& Stanton, 2009).Given that relationships with parents areimportant for psychosocial well-being acrossthe lifespan (Bray & Stanton, 2009), and giventhe sexual prejudice that continues to charac-terize contemporary US society, it is perhapsunsurprising that sexual minorities often fearor anticipate rejection from their parents andworry about their response (Charbonnier &Graziani, 2016). Research conducted from the1980s to the early 2000s indicated that non-affirming parental reactions to their children’scoming out are common and that the periodaround disclosure to parents often taxes theparent–child relationship (Patterson, 2000;Savin-Williams & Dubé, 1998; Willoughbyet al., 2008). Parental rejection generally hasa negative impact on sexual minority youths’psychosocial adjustment (D’Augelli, 2003;Ryan et al., 2010), because young people’sself-perceptions are influenced by how theybelieve their parents evaluate and view them(Rohner, 2004). In contrast, research shows thatwhen LGBQ+ youth have a positive coming outexperience with their parents, it helps them tofeel whole and experience a sense of coherence(Perrin-Wallqvist & Lindblom, 2015). By thetime that LGBQ+ youth come out to theirparents, they have been aware of their same-sexattraction for 3 years on average, so parentalacceptance can provide a sense of safety, con-fidence, and even liberation (Perrin-Wallqvist& Lindblom, 2015). Parental validation of theirchildren’s sexual minority identity predictsgreater self-acceptance, higher self-esteem, andis associated with less depression, substanceabuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors intheir children (Ryan et al., 2010). Nevertheless,parental responses to their child’s disclosureare currently not fully understood in all theirnuances and subtleties (Reczek, 2016).Parental Responses to Coming-out: Differencesby Age Cohort?Discourses around LGBQ+ people havechanged over the past decade(s) (Dunlap, 2016;Witeck, 2014). LGQB+ youth who grow up inWestern societies at present are embedded ina socio-cultural context that stresses equalitymore so than before and that features increasingsocietal and judicial support for sexual minori-ties (Witeck, 2014). For example, inclusiveapproaches have been successfully introducedto LGBQ+ people regarding their equal rights tolegal marriage in the United States and over twodozen other nations, as well as the right to servein the military in many nations. However, oldercohorts of LGBQ+ people (born in the 1950sand 1960s) in the United States and westernEurope grew up at the time when “homosexual-ity” was considered a psychiatric disorder. Thiswas also the time when gay pride discoursesemerged among LGBQ+ communities, follow-ing the first gay pride events. A different cohortof LGB+ people born in the 1970s and 1980scame of age at a time when the HIV/AIDS epi-demic peaked in the United States and Europebut adequate AIDS treatments became available.Thus, despite facing more stigma due to fear ofAIDS, there was also greater political awarenessand access to LGBQ+ community for LGBQ+people.Due to these socio-cultural changes, knowl-edge and acceptance of LGBQ+ issues inthe late 20th and early 21st centuries, com-ing out processes to parents are likely to be1118 Journal of Marriage and Familydifferent for older cohorts of LGBQ+ peoplethan middle or younger cohorts. The presentstudy had two aims. We explored the rangeof responses parents had to their children’sdisclosure, including potential nuances by usingretrospective recollections of LGBQ+ peopleof various ethnicities/races. Additionally, weaimed to identify potential variation across agecohorts.A small body of literature that has explicitlyexamined and compared different age cohortsof LGBQ+ individuals suggests that contem-porary sexual minorities come out both atyounger ages (Dunlap, 2016) and in greaternumbers (Dunlap, 2016; Grov et al., 2006;Savin-Williams, 1998) than in the 1980s or1990s. In the United States, Floyd and Bake-man (2006) explored possible maturational(coming out at a young vs. older age) or his-torical (coming out in earlier sociohistoricalperiods) differences, and found some evidencefor both models. Respondents who came outwhen young were still living at home and underparental control, whereas those who came outlater had more social and financial freedom.These age-related differences were found bothamong older and younger respondents, indi-cating a variety of coming out trajectories.Similarly, Grov et al. (2006) surveyed LGBparticipants of five age cohorts (18–24, 25–34,35–44, 45–54, and 55+) in New York Cityand Los Angeles and found evidence that theyoungest cohort had come out at younger ages.Grierson and Smith (2005) interviewed 32gay men living in Melbourne, Australia, con-sisting of 11 who were born between 1953 and1962 (“pre-AIDS”), 11 born between 1963 and1969 (“peri-AIDS”), and 10 born after 1969(“post-AIDS”). The oldest group reported com-ing out to parents as tense and emotionallycharged, and of “working up the courage, of con-templating possible consequences” (p. 59). Forthis cohort, coming out usually changed theirrelationship with their parents, often in positiveways. The youngest group came out at a youngerage, expected a more positive response fromtheir parents, and seemed more matter-of-factin talking about the experience than were theolder men.Besides the few cohort studies on comingout, a different way of evaluating how parentalreactions may have changed over the pastdecades is to compare findings of coming out toparents by LGBQ+ people in studies publishedfrom the 1970s until the 2010s. Studies ofLGBQ+ participants who came out to parentsin the late 1970s (DeVine, 1984; Lewis, 1984)demonstrate that disclosure was followed byparental avoidance (denial, or a refusal toacknowledge, that their child is LGB), as wellas conflict. Results based on LGBQ+ samplesin the 1990s and the start of the millenniumalso emphasized that the majority of parentsresponded to their children’s disclosure neg-atively at first, expressing emotions such asanger, shock, denial, embarrassment, or sadnessbut also suggest that improvement occurredwhen parents were willing to change their (het-eronormative) beliefs (D’Augelli et al., 1998;Goldfried & Goldfried, 2001; Savin-Williams &Ream, 2003). However, research has indicatedthat the expression of positive and negative reac-tions, and changes toward acceptance amongparents, did not always follow a linear progres-sion. For example, the majority (85%) of the 60participants in a study by Reczek (2016), whocame out in the 1990s, narrated ambivalent reac-tions from parents. Examples included parentalacceptance (e.g., being friendly toward same-sexpartners) combined with overt or covert rejec-tion (e.g., not including the same-sex partnerin a letter about an official family occasion).Furthermore, unlike respondents who cameout in the 1970s, a new theme among youthcoming out in the 1990s was that some parentssuspected and asked their children if they wereLGB (Savin-Williams, 1998).Studies from the past decade support the ideathat invalidating responses remain common, yetparental responses are more varied than merelyrejection versus acceptance. For example,D’Amico et al. (2015) distinguished three coredimensions in parental responses: Parental Sup-port, Parental Struggles, and Parental Attemptsto Change Their Child’s Sexual Orientation.Roe (2017) found that some parents providedtheir children with mixed messages, wherethe parents would express affection but alsomake hurtful remarks about their children’sLGB identity. Rosario et al. (2009) suggesteda “neutral” category, referring to “indifferentparents,” in addition to rejection and acceptance.Although the neutral and accepting responsesoutnumbered the negative responses, rejectioncontinued to be common.Considering the wealth of literature aboutcoming out to parents, as well as the increasingevidence that parental responses go beyondParental Responses to Coming out by LGBQ+ People 1119rejection versus validation, it is analyticallyimportant to work with a model that can illumi-nate the multifaceted and complex nature of thisphenomenon. Chrisler (2017) recently presenteda theoretical model of multiple components ofcoming out responses by parents drawing fromempirical literature in a narrative tradition(based on over 20 studies). The model viewscoming out as a multidimensional process andis thus very suitable for examining a broad vari-ety of parental appraisals, their rationale, andunfolding coping behavior by parents followingdisclosure. Chrisler’s components consist ofthe following: (a) The degree to which parentshave a prior notion about their child’s feelings(i.e., some parents have suspicions, which mayinitiate uncertainty reduction activities, andother parents are unaware); (b) at some point itis (directly or indirectly) confirmed or disclosedto parents that their child is attracted to thesame sex and/ or has an LGBQ+ identity; (c)disclosure is accompanied by parental appraisal,where parents inscribe meaning to this newinformation, and convey whether it conflictsor resonates with their beliefs and values; (d)appraisal is influenced by parental ability toidentify coping strategies; (e) appraisal is oftenfollowed by, or coincides with, a responsethat includes an evaluation; (f) many parentswhen they get confirmation of their child’ssame-sex attraction, and as a way to reduce ordeal with their stress, apply coping strategies(e.g., avoidant and approach coping styles), aprocess that may be followed by re-appraisalof their child’s disclosure. Furthermore, (g) allcomponents are influenced by contextual fac-tors, including parent and family relationships,as well as cultural or societal beliefs and values.Study GoalsThe evolving body of research that mapsthe range of parental responses is importantfor thinking beyond a rejection-acceptancedichotomy or continuum, but more researchis needed to document and understand thesecomplex and varied responses and digest themanalytically This is of particular importancegiven the profound societal changes in LGBQ+acceptance in the past decades. Therefore,our research questions are: (a) What rangeof parental responses to coming out emergeamong narrative interviews with LGBQ+ peo-ple of various ethnicities in the United Statesin three age cohorts? (b) To what extent arethere thematic differences between the three agecohorts in narratives about parental responses tocoming out? and (c) To what extent do narrativethemes analytically fit within Chrisler’s (2017)framework of parental reactions to coming out?We were sensitized by literature that suggeststhat positive or a somewhat more “neutral”content (Rosario et al., 2009) would be moreoften found in the younger cohort, whereasnegative reactions would be more prevalent inthe middle and older cohorts (Savin-Williams &Cohen, 2015).MethodStudy DesignData come from the Generations Study, alarge-scale, multimethod project that includedqualitative interviews. The overall aim of theGenerations Study is to explore cohort differ-ences in sexual identity, minority stress andresilience, and access to healthcare and healthoutcomes for LGBQ+ adults in the UnitedStates. The study focuses on three cohorts ofUS LGB people (http://www.generations-study.com). The older age group (ages 52–59) inour study grew up as the first post-Stonewallcohort, during an era when homosexuality wasperceived to be a mental health disorder andsodomy was illegal in many US states. It wasalso this age group of LGBQ+ people whofirst started making endeavors to cultivate pridewithin their communities, so we refer to thisgroup as the Pride cohort. The middle age group(ages 34–41) came of age in the United Statesat a time when the HIV/AIDS epidemic peakedin the United States and political awarenessincreased, sodomy laws were shown to beunconstitutional, and the federal “don’t ask,don’t tell” policy in the US military was over-turned. We refer to this cohort as the Visibilitycohort. Finally, we refer to the youngest cohort(ages 18–25), as the Equality cohort, becausethey came of age at a time when discoursesaround LGBQ+ people changed to those stress-ing equality, and the overall attitude among theUS population had become more accepting ofLGBQ+ rights (Witeck, 2014).InstrumentFor the Generations Study, interviews wereconducted using a narrative approach (e.g.,1120 Journal of Marriage and FamilyFrost et al., 2014), in a semi-structured pro-tocol. The main topics of the instrument werekey events and trajectories in participants’life stories, same-sex awareness (includingdisclosure to family and friends), sexual iden-tity development, minority stress experiences,internalized homophobia, and healthcare expe-riences. For the analyses in our study we drewfrom those sections of the interview that focusedon same-sex attraction awareness and potentialand/or partial disclosure to significant others. Akey question was: “Tell me about how you cameto identify yourself with this sexual identitylabel and your process of telling others aboutyour identity?” (followed by a probe aboutcoming out to parents).Participants, Recruitment, and ProcedureParticipants were recruited from within 80 milesof four geographic regions of the United States:New York City Metro area; San Francisco BayArea; Tucson, Arizona; and Austin, Texas. Par-ticipants were eligible for the study if theyresided in the United States when they wereaged 6–13 (to assure these individuals came ofage in the social contexts that are the subjectof this investigation); were proficient in English;and had completed the sixth grade of school orhigher. Quota sampling ensured equal represen-tation of participants across cohorts.To meet these sampling aims, the study usedan adapted targeted nonprobability samplingstrategy. A list was made of key venues vis-ited by sexual minority individuals in eachof the four sites (e.g., stores, restaurants,churches/synagogues, parks, bars, etc.). In orderto find interviewees who might not otherwiseattend these venues, advertisements were placedin local social media. Trained recruiters soughtparticipants from these venues, and gave candi-dates study information that included a websiteand a toll-free number where screening foreligibility took place. Coordinators checked andensured that no venue was disproportionatelyrepresented in the sample. Interviews were heldat university offices or other private locationssuggested by participants. Participants weregiven $75 for their participation. Interviewswere collected between April 2015 and April2016, and lasted 2–3 hours. The study hadInstitutional Review Board approval.The total number of interviewees was 191;however, for this study 35 respondents (n = 12equality cohort, n = 5 visibility cohort, n = 18pride cohort) had to be excluded because theyhad either not come out to their parents, they hadcome out but the parental response was not dis-cussed, or it was unclear whether they had comeout to their parents. The sample for this studythus consisted of 61 interviewees in the equalitycohort, 65 in the visibility cohort, and 29 in thepride cohort (n = 155). About 65% identified asgay or lesbian, 20% identified as bisexual, and15% as queer, pansexual, or two-spirit. Trans-gender participants were included in a sepa-rate US Transgender Population Health Survey.About 40%–45% of participants identified asmale, a similar percentage as female, and 10%as gender queer. Race/ethnicity was reported asWhite (n = 38), African American (n = 28),Latino/Hispanic (n = 31), Asian/Pacific Islander(n = 23), American Indian (n = 15) and Bi- orMultiracial (n = 21).AnalysisInterviews were transcribed verbatim and storedin Dedoose 2016 qualitative software. The rel-evant transcript excerpts (i.e., those related tocoming out to parents) were retrieved by firststudying answers of participants to the probeabout coming out to parents (asked by interview-ers in approximately 90% of all cases). We com-bined this with a computer-aided search of theentire transcript, using the search words comingout, come out, (came out), disclose, family, par-ent(s), mother, mum, mom, father, and dad. Rel-evant excerpts were stored in Excel (categorizedby interviewee), and consisted of 250–1,200words, with an average of 335 words per inter-viewee. Given the size of our sample, and ourinterest in differences in the coming out expe-rience across socio-historical cohorts, we testedfor the significance of patterns across cohorts bytreating data that could be counted (i.e., the pres-ence versus absence of coded themes) quantita-tively and using chi-square tests. These analysesare presented prior to the qualitative investiga-tion in each result section. Separately, we per-formed a qualitative thematic analysis (Hiles &Čermák, 2008) of all excerpts, which was con-ducted based on a constant and systematic com-parison (Boeije, 2002). The thematic analysisbegan with open coding; coding was conductedby a team of four researchers (diverse in terms ofgender, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity).The first author coded narratives of coming outParental Responses to Coming out by LGBQ+ People 1121responses from parents and grouped responsesinto categories. Then the second, third, andfourth authors compared the raw data to the ini-tial coding by the first author and commentedon, revised, or supplemented the codes. The firstauthor refined coding accordingly and discussedcodes until consensus was reached in cases ofdisagreement. These four authors made sugges-tions for interpretation of the coding (Hiles &Čermák, 2008) that led to theme identification.The initial codes developed by the first authorwere “Various levels of shock versus knowl-edge,” “Rejection,” “Acceptance,” and “Noexplicit rejection but no acceptance” responses.However, through discussions, the authorsdecided that “Rejection” and “Acception” weretoo binary based on what some participantsreported. These observations led to adjustmentsand eventually arrival at a final set of codes: “In-validating response” and “Validating response”were recognizable, but “No explicit rejection butno acceptance” proved not to be precise enoughand we reworked this into codes that reflectedthe behavior or type of response beyond posi-tive/negative responses: “Silence” and “Mixedpositive and negative responses.” These codesprovided the basis for our narrative themes.In a second stage, the authors recognized thesaliency of Chrisler’s (2017) theoretical modelof components in coming out to parents in thenarrative themes that emerged from our analyticprocess. As such, the Chrisler model provideda way to re-organize the findings. This also ledto the addition of the theme “Coping behavior”to our analysis. Initially, we attempted codingfor “Same-gender parent versus other-genderparent response,” but there were quite a fewcases where only one parent’s response wasreported, and therefore this code was left out ofour further analyses. Race and gender were notanalyzed systematically and will thus only bereported when a salient difference was observedregarding these markers. Furthermore, the datadid not allow for a systematic analysis regardingthe age when respondents came out. For allthematic findings, we provide quotes as samplepieces of evidence and frequencies to indicatesaliency and prominence of each theme. Thefrequencies reported are not mutually exclusivebecause multiple characteristics were some-times found in coming out incidents and someparticipants reported more than one incidentthat differed in characteristics.ResultsNarrative Themes in Relation to Coming outto ParentsA first set of themes demonstrated that, accord-ing to participants, parental responses variedwith the degree of their a priori knowledgeabout respondents’ sexual identity. Theseresponses ranged from suspicion to surprise,which largely match the first componentsin Chrisler’s model; we also identified “cer-tainty.” Moreover, parental appraisal (a corecomponent in Chrisler’s model) was visiblein our data, yet we were also able to expandthis component into lacking, negative, mixed,or positive appraisals with accompanyingsilent, invalidating, ambivalent, and validatingresponses. Unlike Chrisler (2017) we relied ondescriptions of parents’ responses as indica-tions of their appraisals. Furthermore, similarto Chrisler (2017), we also identified parentalcoping behavior on the basis of interviews withLGBQ+ respondents that reflected avoidance(e.g., denial or negation) but also identifiedapproach coping styles (e.g., seeking support).Findings are elaborated accordingly and sum-marized in Figure 1. Figure 1 is an adaptedand supplemented version of Chrisler’s model,based on our empirical findings.LGBQ+ Children’s Accounts of the Degree ofParental (Un)Certainty and how ParentsAddressed this (Un)CertaintyParental Suspicion and Parental Certainty.Many respondents (n = 43) stated that theirparents (mostly their mother) had suspectedor even said they were certain before theirchild came out. We did not find significantcohort differences in the frequency of suspicionor certainty, 𝜒2(6, n = 155) = 1.07, ns (seeTable 1). A Black woman in the visibility cohortdescribed suspicion in her mother: “she said,‘I suspected it’ or ‘the family suspected it,’” oras a Latino man in the pride cohort stated: “Itold her (mother) if she really thought it was thatbig of a surprise, and she said no.”Furthermore, we identified a new sub-theme that extends the first component ofChrisler’s (2017) framework. Our data showedmany examples of respondents who said theirparents had been certain and convinced (beyondsuspicion) even before they came out. As aWhite woman from the equality cohort stated,1122 Journal of Marriage and FamilyFigure 1. A theoretical-empirical framework of parental responses when a child comes out with a same-sexattraction, in three cohorts in the United States (adapted from Chrisler, 2017).“They (parents) were like ‘We knew’”. In mostcases, respondents described this pattern ofperceived knowledge for their mothers: whenwe asked respondents to share the reasons theythought their mother knew, they reported that “amother always knows her child” (quote from aMultiracial man from the pride cohort). Otherrespondents said their parents had prior knowl-edge based on respondents’ gender expressionor gender nonconforming friends, the intensityof their same-sex friendships, or their admirationfor a specific (same-sex) person.Although the frequency of suspicion or cer-tainty did not differ much across age cohorts,qualitative analyses suggested that how respon-dents reacted when parents expressed their per-ceived knowledge or suspicion may vary bycohort. This will be discussed next.Reports of Parents Asking Directly About Sex-ual Orientation to Reduce Uncertainty Versusa Lack of Desired Communication. A substan-tial portion of respondents said their parents hadasked directly when they suspected (n = 22),with no variation in frequency among the threecohorts, 𝜒2(6, n = 155) = 0.03, ns (see Table 1).Respondents said their parents asked them aboutthe gender of their romantic attraction, or explic-itly inquired about their sexual identity. Forinstance, a Multiracial man from the equalitycohort illustrated: “He (stepfather) said, ‘can Iask you a question?’ outta nowhere.(…) He said,‘Are you gay?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’” A White womanfrom the pride cohort, heard a different tone fromher parents: “I had my mom over for dinner onenight… She said, ‘Are you and Sandy more thanjust friends?’ …I drummed up every amount ofcourage I had and burst into tears…and said yes.My mom was mad.” Some respondents indicatedthat their parents were “fishing” or in exceptionalcases they even felt they were worn down bywhat resembled a “cross-examination.” As canbe seen from the examples, suspicion about theirchild’s sexual identity was followed by a varietyof parental evaluations. However, when directasking felt like a cross examination, this wasalways followed by a negative parental response.In other cases, however, respondents wouldhave appreciated parental “uncertainty reduc-tion strategies” (i.e., having a conversation withthem). Some respondents also asked their moth-ers why they had known or suspected but hadnever said anything. A few mothers replied theydid not want to upset their child by asking abouttheir sexuality if it was not true, as a Latinoman from the visible cohort quoted his mother:“What if you weren’t and I just assumed youwere, and then I would’ve—you would havean identity crisis?” Some respondents werefrustrated with their parents and attributed their(past) sexual identity development challenges tothis lack of parental engagement. For example,a Black woman from the visibility cohortexclaimed:‘Why the hell didn’t you guys tell me so that Iwould know what was happening?’ I was just thisperson, I was completely asexual—it would havebeen nice for them to tell me that that’s what I was.Parental Responses to Coming out by LGBQ+ People 1123Table 1.

Participants in the vis-ibility cohort reported parental shock andsurprise significantly more often than thosefrom either the equality or the pride cohort,𝜒2(6, n = 155) = 9.89, p< .05 (see Table 1).Qualitatively, however, shock or surprised1124 Journal of Marriage and Familyseemed very comparable across cohorts. Anexample of shock comes from a Latina/Whitewoman from the visibility cohort who describedher mother’s response:I said: ‘I’m gay.’ I was holding her hand and shepulled her hand away and … her face just fell. Shewent from looking concerned and a little worriedto just shocked. She just looked stunned (…) ‘Idon’t know what to say.’ I said ‘Do you wanna askme anything? Do you want me to leave?’ She said,‘No. I don’t know (…)’ She moved. She physicallyhad moved away from me.Respondents reported shocked responses fromtheir parents mostly in tandem with a nonaf-firmative reaction, including negative emotionssuch as crying, screaming, and outburst of anger.Nevertheless, some exceptions existed, as thenarrative of an Asian woman from the equalitycohort showed:She took a deep breath, and kept asking if I wassure, but I think she just asked that cuz she didn’tknow what to say. She didn’t have a pamphlettelling her how to respond to a child that just cameout to you, and so she stated that… She sat me nextto her and told me that it’s okay.Appraisal of Same-Sex Sexuality: Silence,Invalidation, Mixed Responses, and ValidationAppraisals of Same-sex Sexuality as a Taboo,Followed by Silent Responses from Parents.Whether parents suspected or not, they allengaged in appraisal of the same-sex sexualityof their children when they found out, whichthen went hand in hand with an accompanyingresponse. Across cohorts, many respondentsreported that their parents reacted with silence(n = 42), 𝜒2(6, n = 155 = 5.78, ns (see Table 1),including parents who did not appear to suspectthat their child was LGBQ+. Silence couldmean many things, including that sexuality wasa “forbidden” topic; however, silence couldalso be indicative of general difficulties familiesfaced vocalizing emotions. Silence could alsomean a covert negative response or a covertpositive response. Finally, silence could be amarker of the unknown. First, some respondentsindicated that sexuality (regardless whetherheterosexual or nonheterosexual) was appraisedas a “taboo topic” in their family before, andalso after, they came out. As a Latino manfrom the equality cohort explained: “it’s alwaysjust been one of those things swept under therug… if something about that came on TV, mymom would turn it off.” Another illustration ofthe taboo of sexuality came from a Multiracialwoman from the pride cohort: “I knew theywouldn’t understand, so I just didn’t talk aboutit with them. My parents never talked aboutsex anyway. That was something that wasn’t apolite conversation.” In these examples, parentsindicated discomfort regarding same-sex attrac-tion, and it was difficult for children to discusstheir sexual identity with them. In some casescoming out as LGB was associated with suchtaboo that it led to a breakdown in communi-cation between respondents and parents. Formost respondents, this breakdown was limitedto the topic of same-sex attraction, but in afew cases the silence was general and lastedseveral months to over two decades (at time ofinterview).Next, multiple respondents perceived that alack of communication from their parents upontheir coming out went hand-in-hand with a lackof ability in their families to verbalize emotionsin general. As a White man from the visibilitycohort illustrated:It became really obvious that we weren’t evertalking about any of it (sexuality). But the isolationand the suppression of emotions is still runningrampant in my family. Nobody knows how to talkabout feelings at all.This respondent understands silence about hissexuality as embedded in a family that lacks abil-ities for communication about feelings. Somerespondents referred to their parents’ culture,age or traditions as playing a big role in sexual-ity (and thus, also same-sex sexuality) as a tabooor as a “no go area,” because it involved talkingabout emotions.Those parents who were described as silentoften initially refrained from giving any explicitevaluation later on as well. As a White male fromthe visibility cohort pointed out:The only times that we have acknowledged inconversation or communication that I’m gay waswhen I came out… My mother said over and overagain, ‘I just don’t know what to do with thisinformation . . . .’ and then that was the absoluteend of publically acknowledging or communicat-ing in the family that I am gay.Parental Responses to Coming out by LGBQ+ People 1125When coming out was the reason for a full break-down in communication between respondentsand their parents, the meaning of silence wasnegative and parents were perceived as rejecting.Nevertheless, some respondents felt that parentalinability to communicate about their sexual iden-tity was not necessarily a rejection. Parentalsilence was then a marker of the unknown.Those respondents noted difficulty reading theirfather’s mind in particular (it was common thatmothers informed fathers, that is, an indirectcoming out), as a White woman from the visibil-ity cohort said: “He (the father) actually has noteven mentioned it to me. I’ve been around him bymyself. I’ve been around him with her (respon-dent’s girlfriend). Even now he knows, but Idon’t know how he feels about it.” In these cases,silence from parents tapped into insecurity aboutparental approval. Another variation observed insome cases, however, was parental silence thatwas perceived as an unspoken form of accep-tance, as a Multiracial woman from the visibilitycohort illustrated: “I’ve never been shown anydiscontent from my family. My dad, who foundout through them [mother and sisters], I neverhad to talk with him but it was just understood.”Although we did not detect differences in thefrequency of silence across cohorts, our qual-itative analysis provided insight into variationin how silence was evaluated across cohorts. Inthe equality cohort, some respondents were sim-ply not willing to accept silence on the topicof same-sex sexuality from parents any longer,even when their parents were struggling withsexuality as a taboo topic. A rather bold anecdoteof an equality cohort Latino male participant isan illustration of this. He described a strategyhe used when his mother would not acknowl-edge his bisexuality: “I tape condoms to my wall,right? I sent her a picture of that. She’s like,‘What are you doing with those?’ I was like, ‘Oh,I use that on guys and girls.’” Respondents in thepride cohort did not describe parents’ inabilityto communicate explicitly about sexual identityin the same fraught terms as those in the equal-ity and visibility cohorts. For example, a Whitewoman respondent from the pride cohort foundher mother’s silent response amusing rather thanupsetting:We were talking on the phone and I said, ‘So, I ama lesbian, mom.’ She was like, ‘Do you know itwas 98 degrees here today.’ I said, ‘Mom, I knowyou heard me.’ She goes, ‘We don’t have to talkabout everything.’ [Laughter] It’s like, ‘Okay.’Appraisals Linked to Perceived InvalidatingResponses. Many respondents’ whose par-ents appraised same-sex sexuality negativelyalso provided an invalidating response totheir coming out. Persons in the pride cohortreported negative responses from their parentssignificantly less often compared to youngercohorts, 𝜒2(6, n = 155) = 21.96, p< .05 (seeTable 1). The qualitative analysis showedthemes in underlying conflicts between LGBQ+identities and a parental belief system that seemrelatively unaffected by societal changes, whichmay go to show the relevance of invalidationeven for youth today. First, a highly commontheme across cohorts was condemnation of thechild’s sexual identity on religious groundsas a contextual (societal) factor. For example,using the notion that a religious upbringingcan prevent same-sex sexuality, a White malerespondent in the visibility cohort mentioned hisfather had said: “This isn’t what God wants foryou, you are going to hell.” Other respondents,regardless of their cohort, mentioned culturalfactors as reasons for invalidation: “It’s hard,especially, I think, in my culture and in myfamily. People have this black-and-white binarythinking that you have to like one or the other”(woman, equality cohort, Multiracial). Otherrespondents referred to conservatism in theirfamilies (mostly in relation to their father), as areason for homophobic responses.In some narratives, negative parentalresponses originated from a sense of disap-pointment or loss on the part of the parent forheteronormative traditions and rituals, such asa Black woman in the pride cohort who noted:“My dad was pissed that I deprived him of beingthe dad who was gonna walk his daughter to theaisle.” This example also describes the impactof heteronormativity in society. Furthermore,some respondents said their parents depictedsame-sex attraction as one of many “deviant”behaviors. As a male Asian respondent in thevisibility cohort illustrated: “She [mother] islike, ‘What else are you up to? Are you takingdrugs too?’”Some respondents who mentioned invalida-tion from parents explained this as related toexisting tension in their relationships. A whitemale participant from the pride cohort had been1126 Journal of Marriage and Familyraised with a rather absent father. He remembersthat when he came out to his father: “It was hor-rible. He was like, ‘I raised you in a catholicupbringing! How could you be telling me this?’( . . . .) [Name partner] was there. [Name part-ner] was like, ‘Fuck him. Whatever. He wasn’tthere in your life anyway!’” In these cases, rejec-tion from parents was interpreted as reiteratingpre-existing relational difficulties, sometimes inaddition to blatant homophobia.Finally, in two white male participants (bothfrom the visibility cohort), parents immediatelyfocused on HIV/AIDS risk when the respondentcame out: “One of the first things he [father]said to me was like, ‘When are you gonna getAIDS?’”Appraisal Linked to a Mixture of Acceptanceand Invalidating Responses. Ambivalence in theappraisal of same-sex sexuality by respondents’parents coincided with mixed responses. Somerespondents said their parents expressed accep-tance while they also communicated invalidation(n = 47); these mixed responses were equallypresent across cohorts, 𝜒2(6, n = 155) = 4.22, ns(see Table 1). Several categories existed withinthis theme of mixed invalidation. First, someparental responses demonstrated explicit criti-cism of the “lifestyle” associated with same-sexsexualities, although the parents involved herealso expressed love. For example, a male Amer-ican Indian respondent from the visibility cohortdescribed his mother’s response: “I don’t haveto agree with your lifestyle, but you’re still myson. I’m still gonna love you.” Some partici-pants reacted with resistance toward the separa-tion their parents had created by framing theirdisclosed sexual identity as a preference, style orchoice. As a Multiracial man from the equalitycohort indicated:I said [to mother], you know what, if you can’taccept my happiness and be happy for who I am,then I really don’t need people like you in my life.Ever since that, it made my mother and I’s bond abit stronger.A second category in this theme was character-ized by a disconnection between what parentssaid in response to coming out and how they sub-sequently behaved. This category was infrequentand consisted of situations in which respon-dents’ mothers had been neutral or acceptingwhen they came out, but then subsequentlybehaved differently. As a Middle Eastern manfrom the visibility cohort indicated:I think it’s just never being fully in an environmentthat’s safe. Even at home, even though my motheris neutral about how she feels about my identity,there is a lot of sly negative comments about you’renot gonna be accepted.The third common narrative of mixed accep-tance concerned the conditional acceptance ofrespondents’ identities. Restricted visibility wasone of those conditions; for example, parentswould ask respondents not to bring a same-sexpartner home: “What they [parents] said was thatif you’re gay or bisexual that’s fine but don’tbring it around the house” (woman, visibilitycohort, Black). A few other respondents saidthey were confronted with gender expressioncriteria (and pressures) as conditions of receiv-ing parental validation resulting in a highlyconditional or ambivalent form of acceptance.For example, a Black woman in the visibilitycohort explained about her mother’s attitude:My mother was neutral first. I invited [a girl] tomy house and my mom flipped… had a fit becauseshe was clearly gay. She had her letterman jacketon, her hair was in a ponytail, and she brought thisother chick with her who was like eight feet tall.A fourth, and very common, category of a mixedappraisal resulting in an ambivalent responsewas one where evaluation of coming out seemedto be contingent on the successful manage-ment of family relations. With two exceptions,only respondents of families of color (but notone race in particular) provided this type ofresponse. Responses of this type were onlyexpressed by mothers (who were also often thefirst person to learn this). Respondents with thisnarrative said their mother would refrain froma personal evaluation of their sexual identitybut quickly pointed out that this informationwould be a problem for her husband and/or theextended family; some even hinted that the fam-ily reputation was jeopardized. As a Multira-cial woman from the visibility cohort explained:“She wanted to wait to tell the extended fam-ily, my aunts and uncles, her brothers and sis-ters and their kids. I think a lot of it (…) wasbecause of fear. She’s afraid they’re gonna judgeher, or me, or whatever it is.” This finding thusimplies a contextual difference between growingup as an LGBQ+ person in an ethnic minorityParental Responses to Coming out by LGBQ+ People 1127community, which tends to be more collectivis-tic in nature than most white US communities(which are arguably more individualistic).Another type of ambivalent response tappedinto contextual factors around gender andgender relations in society. A few womenreported responses linked to the sexualizationof female same-sex sexuality. Some mentionedthat their fathers had wanted to “check outwomen” together when they came out, whichrespondents thought was inappropriate. In twocases, respondents’ fathers even tried to flirt withfemale partners. As a White woman from thepride cohort illustrated: “When I would bringmy girlfriend around, he’d make passes at her(…) It was really bizarre. Real incestuous. Verystrange.” Some female respondents felt theirfather’s sexualized response signaled that he hadnot grasped that they were telling him somethingprofound about their identities that deservedrespect, although some other respondents felttheir fathers were simultaneously also tryingto “bond with them,” albeit in “weird” ways.Closely related to the sexualization theme, aLatino woman from the pride cohort mentionedthat her bisexuality was understood by herparents as originating from pressure from herhusband to engage in sex and relationships withwomen.Appraisal Connected to Perceived Validationand Acceptance From Parents. More respon-dents in the equality cohort reported positiveappraisal (expressed through affection, support,being “neutral” or somewhat indifferent) andaccompanying validating statements from par-ents (n = 77) compared to the visibility andpride cohorts, 𝜒2(6, n = 155) = 45.01, p< .05(see Table 1). Qualitative results that revealed thefive types of rationales for parental validation (asdescribed by their children) provided some ideasfor explaining the high frequency in the youngestcohort. First of all, we found a qualitative cohortdifference that consisted of parents’ knowledgeof the term “minority stress” that was reported bya few participants from the equality and visibilitycohorts, but not the pride cohort. Knowledge ofthese stressors seemed to sensitize parents to theimportance of acceptance, and the health risks ofrejection.Second, a number of respondents of theequality and visibility cohorts mentioned thattheir parents viewed their sexual identity asan authentic part of themselves. For instance,as a White woman from the equality cohortquoted her mother: “It is not a flaw, it is whoyou are.” Somewhat relatedly, some malerespondents (again only in the visibility andequality cohorts) said their parents (mostlyfathers) expressed their approval based on theidea of personal choice, their children’s free-dom to do as they wanted in their lives. Asa Multiracial man from the equality cohortillustrated his father’s reaction: “He said, son,this is your—this is your life. You’re an adult.You make your own choices.”Third, many respondents whose parentshad a positive appraisal had someone in theirclose circle (family member, their boss) whowas LGBQ+ and with whom they had a goodrelationship. Another common rationale was aliberal/open-minded/feminist/queer supportivefamily environment. For instance, a Multiracialwoman from the equality cohort mentioned thather parents had signaled “wanting to be withthe same sex was not bad.” Both rationales(having an LGBQ+ person in their close circleand growing up in an affirmative setting) werefound equally across cohorts.Finally, some respondents said their parentstook an egalitarian approach (“sexual orientationblind” approach) to their sexual identity and thegender of their partners. For example, a Latinawoman from the equality cohort illustrated howher mother was more focused on socioeconomicclass rather than the gender of her partner: “Shedoesn’t really care one way or the other if it’s aguy or a girl. She’s still like . . . . Do they have agood job? Did they go to college?” Other respon-dents reported that their parents cared mostabout whether they found someone whose lovewas true and mutual, while others had parentswho pointed out that “same sex relationships arejust as difficult to make them work as heterosex-ual ones” (quote from a Biracial woman in theviability cohort). These reactions about charac-teristics that would be desirable in a partner werefound across all cohorts, but were more commonamong the equality and visibility cohorts.Parental Coping ResponsesRespondents mentioned their parents had usedstrategies that seemed focused on reducing thestress involved with their disclosure or confir-mation, that is, coping behavior. Respondentslisted responses that to a large extent matchedavoidant and approach styles of coping (in line1128 Journal of Marriage and Familywith Chrisler, 2017). Avoidant styles were sig-nificantly less often reported by respondentsin the pride cohort, 𝜒2(6, n = 155) = 13.70,p< .05 (see Table 1). Avoidant coping mostlyconsisted of assumptions by respondents’ par-ents that a sexual minority identity was a tempo-rary phenomenon for adolescents, or a “phase.”Some respondents said their parents felt theyhad been “too young to know what they want”(quote from an Asian woman from the equal-ity cohort). These age-related convictions mayexplain the higher frequency of avoidance inthe equality and visibility cohort. Equality andvisibility cohort respondents seemingly wereyounger when they came out (based on ourimpression, missing data prevented a systematiccomparison). Additionally, another way throughwhich parents expressed avoidance was througha flat denial of their child’s self-expressed sexualidentity, as a Latina participant from the equal-ity cohort illustrated her mother’s response: “Shewas just like, ‘No, you’re not. You’re not, andso you shouldn’t necessarily tell people aboutthat.’” The implied authoritarian tone by parentswho expressed a flat denial matches the youngerage of respondents of the equality cohort. Again,since quite a few pride cohort respondents wereolder than respondents in the equality cohortwhen they came out, this may show the lack ofrelevance of this theme in the pride cohort.Respondents’ accounts sometimes reflectedan approach coping style, similar to thoseChrisler (2017) found. Negative approachstrategies mostly consisted of bargaining ornegotiation on the topic of respondents’ identi-ties, which involved downplay of their same-sexattraction at the favor of (converting back to)a heterosexual life. For example, some femalerespondents said their mothers had mentionedthat they too had experienced “a crush on awoman,” and said this, however, did not meanrespondents were LGBQ per se. Moreover, somebisexual respondents mentioned that bargainingby their parents consisted of “lecturing” thatthey simply could not be attracted to multiplegenders. As a Black woman from the equalitycohort quoted her parents: “You have to pickone side or the other. That (i.e., bisexuality) isnot right. Just lecturing me.” Respondents in thepride cohort reported significantly more nega-tive approach strategies, 𝜒2(6, n = 155) = 15.96,p< .05 (see Table 1). Perhaps negotiations withrespondents seems more appropriate for youngadults and adults, as some parents may simplyto try to “overrule” teenagers (again, bearingin mind that the pride cohort was often in their20s, 30s, or 40s when they came out ratherthan teenagers). Several respondents in thepride cohort mentioned that their parents triedto convince them that they were better offstaying in their heterosexual marriage. Respon-dents in the equality and visibility cohorts alsoreported negative approach coping from parents(bargaining), but the content seemed inspired bytheir young age. For example, their parents saidthey would not be allowed to attend summercamp or a certain school when they found out.Some negative approach strategies seemedrelevant regardless of cohort, for example, thesuggestion by some respondents’ parents thatthey could to get “healed” through therapy.Finally, we found very few examples ofpositive approach coping strategies. Exceptionsincluded respondents who said their parentswanted information about a support group forparents, or one respondent whose parents soughtculturally appropriate information about being“two spirited” in order to understand that itexists in American Indian culture.DiscussionWe focused on the complexities and nuancesinvolved in parental reactions to coming out byLGBQ+ US individuals of various ethnicities,and explored potential differences in these reac-tions among three age cohorts. Chrisler’s (2017)analytical framework was suitable for examiningthe variety of parental purposes in our sample,yet we also needed to adapt and supplement it inorder to speak to all complexities we found.One component of Chrisler’s (2017) modelthat fit our data well addressed the variousdegrees of suspicion parents may have priorto disclosure. Some parents had no suspicionat all about their children’s same-sex attrac-tion and were shocked and stunned; this themewas more salient in the visibility cohort thanin the equality cohort (but also more than inthe pride cohort). Our findings supported previ-ous research that revealed more shocked (e.g.,rather negative) parental reactions in cohortsthat came of age prior to the 1990s (see lit-erature based on data collected in the 1990s,e.g., D’Augelli et al., 1998; Goldfried & Gold-fried, 2001). The increased (positive) media andlegal attention for same-sex sexuality over thepast decade may play a role in understanding theParental Responses to Coming out by LGBQ+ People 1129relatively lower frequency of shock responsesfrom parents indicated by the equality cohortcompared to the visibility cohort. The findingthat the pride cohort also reported less shockfrom parents may seem counterintuitive giventhat many in the pride cohort had been in a het-erosexual marriage before coming out to theirparents. However, many respondents in the pridecohort did not come out to their parents at all, sothere may be a selection effect among those whodid tell their parents. The metaphor of parents“lacking a pamphlet” as mentioned by one ofour respondents—or lacking a “script” as coinedby a parent in Fields’s (2001) study—reflectsthis theme of “shock.” Fields (2001) explainsthis by pointing out that heterosexuality operatesas an organizing principle in society and func-tions as the standard for legitimate and expectedintimate relations. The way heterosexuality asa societal norm impacts the parental expecta-tions of a heterosexual future for their childis also an example of the “contextual factors”in Chrisler’s (2017) frame, underpinning macroinfluences of parental responses to their child’sdisclosure. (see also Cassar & Sultana, 2016).Furthermore, some parents’ reactions weredescribed as the opposite of shock, that is, cer-tainty about their child’s sexuality. This is amodest analytical adaptation to Chrisler’s (2017)model that only described “suspecting and non-suspecting.” Many parents who were describedas “certain” had never said anything to their chil-dren, and respondents in the equality or visibilitycohort in particular who received this feedbackhad wished for a more communicative approachfrom their parents, albeit in a respectful manner.“Fishing” or cross-examinations were not appre-ciated; LGBQ+ youth in the equality cohortexplicitly said they wanted to come out “on theirown terms.” Nevertheless, the increasing visibil-ity of (online) LGBQ+ communities emergingin recent decades has enhanced possibilities forLGBQ+ people from the equality and visibil-ity cohorts to more openly affiliate with (onlineor offline) LGBQ+ communities, thereby alsoincreasing the likelihood of having “suspicious”parents, who may then start “fishing.”We were also able to apply yet refineChrisler’s components of “parental response”and “parental appraisal.” Silence was a particu-lar parental response in our data that has receivedsome attention in a few studies conducted in the1980s and early 1990s that suggested that someparents acted as if coming out never occurred(DeVine, 1984; Martin & Hetrick, 1988; Robin-son et al., 1989). This is consistent with ourfinding that, among quite a few respondents,parental silence meant a specific restriction onfamily communication about sexuality as well assame-sex sexuality. Although research has pre-viously mentioned parental silence as a responseto coming out (Riley, 2010), our study addedto this literature by delving into the meaning ofparental silence according to LGBQ+ people.As for parental appraisal of their child’s disclo-sure (Chrisler, 2017), we found that silence hadconnotations beyond hostility/rejection, whensome respondents understood parental silenceas a marker of the unknown, or as implicitacceptance. Considering the variety of mean-ings addressed to parental silence (includingapproving same-sex sexuality), we assume thatsilence is more complex than an equivalent toavoidant coping by parents, as Chrisler (2017)argued, which suggests that our study offersa conceptual clarification compared with theinitial model.Invalidating responses from parents werefrequent across all cohorts. Thus, although val-idating statements from parents are on the riseaccording to young LGBQ+ people in our study,it is too early to state that the tide has turned.Family rejection can have a long-lasting adverseimpact on LGBQ+ people (Puckett et al., 2015),and therefore continues to need researchers’attention. Religious beliefs were often namedas a rationale for invalidation, in line withWilloughby et al. (2008) and tapped into frus-tration among some of respondents’ parents. AsFields (2001) argues, parental frustration maybe related to the perception that a child’s sexualminority identity would reflect something “bad”about them as parents among their friends,which underpins the relevance of the meso fac-tor (contextual component) in Chrisler’s (2017)model. Next, considering that public attentionto and stigmatization of HIV/AIDS was at itsheight when the visibility cohort came of age,it is notable that very few male visibility cohortrespondents described invalidation from parentsin relation to HIV/AIDS risk, in contrast to aprevious study on coming out by members inthat cohort (Robinson et al., 1989). Furthermore,the fact that the older cohort reported slightlyless invalidation could again be attributed to apotential selection effect in those (relatively)few pride cohort participants who decided tocome out to their parents.1130 Journal of Marriage and FamilyAs suggested by Savin-Williams andCohen (2015), LGBQ+ people in the equal-ity cohort were more likely to receive validatingresponses from parents than older cohorts. Thus,some young LGBQ+ people who grow up assexual minorities at present seem to reap somebenefits from socio-historical changes in theUnited States that have led to increasing supportfor LGBQ+ rights. This finding may also impactthe attitudes of LGBQ+ youth who grow uptoday and who were bolder in their explicit“demands” of parental support, similar toRoe’s (2017) finding in a recent young sample.Additionally, the rationale for parental invali-dation was somewhat different in the equalitycohort; parental messages about the temporalityof an LGBQ+ identity and/or expected changestoward heterosexuality in sexual identity (thatwere also noted by D’Amico et al., 2015) were,with rare exceptions, only found for that cohort.The younger age at which LGBQ+ youth (onaverage) come out at present may be relevanthere, because coming out has changed froman emerging adult experience to an adolescentactivity (Dunlap, 2016). The younger age ofcoming out may also be relevant for understand-ing why some parents of respondents assumedthat deciding for their children who they are interms of their sexualities seemed appropriate fortheir developmental stage.We also noted a qualitative difference invalidating reactions across cohorts. The notionof LGBQ+ authenticity and personal choiceregarding sexuality was put forward only byparents of the visibility and equality cohort.The fact that individualization processes (Beck& Beck-Gernsheim, 2002) became more pro-nounced from the 1960s and 1970s onward, maybe relevant here. Parents of pride cohort respon-dents grew up in an earlier era with less empha-sis on “self-realization” as a goal and were thusless likely to frame sexual identity in such terms.What is more, the idea of same-sex attraction as achoice has been critiqued as problematic, thoughsome respondents found it worked in their bestinterest.We also found evidence of mixed reactionsby parents. Parents’ arguments for a conditionalacceptance of their children may be related toRubin’s (1992) work on how parents draw animaginary line between good, bad, and abnor-mal sexual identities, behaviors, and desires.By making their acceptance conditional, par-ents may have wanted their children to belongto the “right” side of “respectability” in theirsexuality and relationships (cf. LaSala, 2000).Furthermore, our analysis shows that ambiva-lent parental responses may be influenced byrace and ethnicity, as predominantly families ofcolor stressed the need for carefully managingfamily relations by aiming to control further dis-closure of their child. This underpins findingsby Richter et al. (2017) showing the difficultyof parental approval of same-sex sexualities inUS Latino and Black families. Gender of par-ents and gender of the child may also play arole in ambivalent responses, as some of respon-dents’ fathers showed a sexualized response,underpinning arguments by Diamond and But-terworth (2008) that gender-specific researchinto same-sex sexuality is needed. More researchfrom the parental perspective would help usbetter understand the motives behind these com-plex responses with mixed levels of validation,invalidation or tensions.Mostly avoidant and negative approach cop-ing was noted among respondents’ parents,generally in line with how Chrisler (2017)explained these coping styles that are presentin their model. Referral to coming out as “justa phase,” or as an identity that an individual is“too young know about,” was especially foundamong younger cohorts. This may again reflectthe fact many LGBQ+ youth today come out asteenagers rather than as young adults, leadingsome parents to assume they can mold teenagechildren. Negative approach coping consistedof various forms of bargaining in favor ofheterosexuality, which was also discussed bySavin-Williams and Ream (2003). Few copingstrategies were noted that seemed beneficialfor parents’ acceptance, showing a need forreaching out to parents and helping them iden-tifying positive coping strategies. Additionally,given the limitations of our data, we were notable to detect Chrisler’s (2017) sophisticatedcategorization of coping styles into cognitiveversus behavioral avoidance.In spite of the advantages of our study interms of investigating complexities regardingcoming out in three LGBQ+ cohorts, severallimitations exist. We did not ask the age atwhich participants came out to parents, so wecannot determine whether younger participantscame out more recently. Oral history and lifecourse scholars argue that individuals mayreevaluate their perspective of what happenedin their families over time (Thompson, 1988).Parental Responses to Coming out by LGBQ+ People 1131This concern is more salient in the pride cohort,because more time had passed since they cameout to parents. Next, although our large sample(n = 155) and the richness of the interviewdata are strengths of this study, our findingsare focused on parents’ reactions at the timeof coming out, and parental acceptance canchange over time, which we could thus notexamine (Samarova et al., 2013). Additionally,our study was based on LGBQ+ individuals’feelings and ideas about their parental responses.Future studies could learn directly from parentsabout their reactions when their child cameout to them, because parents may not share allthe concerns they have about their children’ssexual identity with their children (D’Amicoet al., 2015). Next, although recruitment effortsto attract individuals from various educationalbackgrounds, sexual identities, ethnicities, andcommunities were successful, it is unclearhow representative our sample is to the generalLGBQ+ population in the United States. Finally,as our study had its focus on cohort differences,a systematic analysis of race, gender and sexualidentity differences was beyond the scope ofthe study. Arguably, such an approach extendsbeyond Chrisler’s broad analytical frame toarrive at a comprehensive elaboration of theimpact of race, gender and sexual identity tocoming out to parents.The study also has implications for practice.Social services and mental healthcare providersworking with families could emphasize thedesire LGBQ+ youth at present seem to feel forcommunicating openly with their parents abouttheir sexual identities. Parents who suspect or“have always known” may need some guidancein how to successfully talk with their childrenabout the topic of sexualities. Furthermore, thefact that some respondents of the equality cohortmentioned how their parents were validatingbut at the same time could not grasp why theyhad not come out to them earlier suggests thatfamilies today need to be made aware thatLGBQ+ identities continue to be stigmatizedidentities in society and therefore make childrenanxious to disclose. Finally, almost all respon-dents in our study could vividly remember andnarrate their coming out process to parents withgreat detail. Hence, it can be assumed that achild’s disclosure continues to strongly impactthe quality of the parent–child relationship,and emphasizes the role of professionals toharmonize conflict and communication issues infamilies.ReferencesBeck, U., & Beck-Gernsheim, E.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe study aimed to better understand the complexities of parental responses to coming out in the narratives from Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Queer, Pansexual, or Two‐Spirited (LGBQ+) individuals, and to examine whether those from recent cohorts experience a different parental response than those in older cohorts.BackgroundSexual minorities come out at younger ages today than in past decades, and coming out to parents is a major part of the identification process.MethodInterview excerpts of 155 US lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, pansexual, or two‐spirited (LGBQ+) respondents were analyzed with a qualitative thematic analysis and with basic quantitative methods. The sample consisted of 61 interviewees in a young cohort (ages 18–25), 65 in a middle cohort (ages 35–42), and 29 in an older cohort (ages 52–59), in six ethnic/racial groups.ResultsThemes based on LGBQ+ people's accounts indicated that parental responses varied with the degree of their a priori knowledge of respondents' sexual identities (ranging from suspicion or certainty to surprise). Parental appraisal was either lacking, negative, mixed, or positive with accompanying silent, invalidating, ambivalent, and validating responses, respectively. Validating responses from parents were more often found in the youngest cohort, but invalidating responses were frequent across all cohorts. LGBQ+ people in the oldest cohort were more inclined to accept their parents being noncommunicative about sexuality in general and also about sexual diversity.ConclusionIt is too early to state that coming out to parents has become easier. Harmony in the parent–child relationship after coming out and open communication about sexual identities is regarded as desirable and yet it remains elusive for many LGBQ+ people",
