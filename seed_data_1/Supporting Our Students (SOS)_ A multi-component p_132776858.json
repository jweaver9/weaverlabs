The program will create safer \nschools by training teachers and administration in every high school to increase awareness of \nqueer and transgender issues and develop skills to intervene when they witness anti-LGBTQ+ \nbehaviors. It will also increase social support and connectedness among participating queer youth \nby providing monthly identity-specific support groups and semi-structured socialization events in the \ncommunity.  \n \n \nPopulation description \nThis intervention aims to focus on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (hereby \nshortened to LGBTQ+ or “queer and transgender”) youth that attend high school in the Washington \nCounty area. Washington County had a population of 574,326 in 2015, making it the second most-\npopulated county in the state of Oregon. The county consists of several suburban cities, and is \nadjacent to Oregon’s most populated city, Portland. The county has a racial make-up of 81.8% \nwhite (67.3% white, not Hispanic or Latino), 2.2% black, 1.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, \n10.1% Asian, 0.5% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and 4.2% two or more races. \nSixteen percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino (U.S Census Bureau, 2015). Compared to \nthe national demographics, the county has a different proportion of black, Asian, and multiracial \npopulations. The proportion of black people (13.3% nationally, 2.2% in the county) is six times \nhigher in the nation than the county, and the proportion of Asian (5.6% nationally, 10.1% in county) \nand multiracial people (2.6% nationally, 4.2% in county) in the county is close to double of the \nnation. The racial make-up of the county is important to note, as the LGBTQ+ population is fairly \nrepresentative of community racial demographics and other characteristics, with the exception of \nage. \nData collection on queer and transgender people is fairly recent, and data collectors may be \nreluctant to ask about sexual orientation and gender identity, so it is difficult to establish reliable \nestimates for the numbers of queer people, and especially queer youth. However, the 2016 Oregon \nStudent Wellness Survey, administered by the Oregon Health Authority through public schools, \nreports that 12.8% of students in the 11th grade in Washington County identified as something \nother than heterosexual. 1.8% identified as gay or lesbian, 5% identified as bisexual, 1.2% \nidentified as queer, 2.2% identified as other, and 2.7% said they weren’t sure (Oregon Health \nAuthority, 2016). This is a significant size of the population, and yet one that is often not discussed \nor focused on, especially when it comes to youth. There are very few local organizations and \nresources designated for LGBTQ+ people near Washington County, and almost all of them are \nlocated in Portland, which can be difficult for youth to reach if they don’t have access to \ntransportation or are in a situation in which it is unsafe for them to come out as queer or \ntransgender. \nThe recent inclusion of questions regarding sexual orientation and sexual partners in the \nNational Youth Risk Behavior Survey has allowed for the first nationally representative study of U.S. \nlesbian, gay, and bisexual students, conducted in 2015. It found that LGB students were \nsignificantly more likely than their heterosexual peers to report: being physically forced to have sex \n(18% LGB vs 5% heterosexual), experiencing sexual dating violence (23% LGB vs 9% heterosexual), \nSupporting Our Students Program P. 3\n   \n  \n  \nand being bullied (at school: 34% LGB vs 19% heterosexual, online: 28% LGB vs 14% heterosexual) \n(Kann et al., 2016).  \nThough the American public is becoming more accepting and same-sex marriage was \nlegalized in 2015 by the Supreme Court of the United States, queer and transgender people are far \nfrom having an equal lived experience to their heterosexual and cisgender peers. It is legal to be \nfired at any time because of sexual orientation or gender identity in 29 and 32 states, respectively \n(Movement Advancement Project, 2016). Though there may be some shared experience among \nLGBTQ+ individuals, the intersection of other identities such as race, ethnicity, class, and age mean \nthe differences between individuals can be larger than their similarities, making it difficult to create \nblanket programs to address the needs of the whole population. Even splitting up the LGBTQ+ \nacronym and looking at each of those identity groups separately shows different needs for each \nsubgroup of the population. \n \nStatement of need  \nThere are significant and high levels of disparity with regards to mental health outcomes in \nqueer and transgender youth, specifically higher rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, suicidal \nideation, self-harm, and attempted and completed suicide than their heterosexual peers. It is \nimportant to recognize that there are several limitations to the data collected on the issues of \nmental health in queer and transgender youth. One of the most relevant is that many surveys don’t \ninclude a question on sexual orientation or gender identity, especially for youth. In addition, \nbecause death records do not include the sexual orientation of the deceased person, there is not a \ngenerally reliable way to determine rates of completed suicide of LBGT people, and most estimates \ncome from posthumous interviews, in which there can be a lot of underreporting – whether out of \nshame, or particularly in the case of youth, the families not knowing about the deceased’s queer \nidentity.  \nSince the early 1990s, population-based surveys that included questions about sexual \norientation have consistently found reported rates of suicide attempts to be two to seven times \nhigher in LGB identifying high school students compared to heterosexual students (Haas et al., \n2011). According to the 2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), more than 40% of LGB \nstudents have seriously considered suicide, and 29% reported having attempted suicide in the last \n12 months, compared to 4% of heterosexual students (Kann et al., 2016). Estimates for suicide \nattempt rates range from 41 to 51% in the transgender youth population (Haas, et al., 2011). A \nstudy using the 2006 and 2008 Oregon Health Teens survey data including nearly 32,000 11 th \ngraders found that LGB students were more than five times as likely to have attempted suicide in \nthe previous 12 months as their heterosexual peers (21.5% and 4.2%, respectively) \n(Hatzenbuehler, 2011). \n Queer youth also exhibit significantly higher rates of other mental health problems, \nincluding anxiety, depression, and self-harm than heterosexual youth. The National Comorbidity \nSurvey Replication Adolescent Supplement found that almost 18% of lesbian and gay youth \nparticipants met the criteria for major depression and 11.3% for PTSD in the previous 12 months, \nand 31% of the LGBT sample reported suicidal behavior at some point in their life. National rates \nfor these diagnoses and behaviors among youth are 8.2%, 3.9%, and 4.1%, respectively (Kessler et \nal., 2012). \nSupporting Our Students Program P. 4\n   \n  \n  \nIt is important to acknowledge the disparities in mental health conditions for queer and \ntransgender people, but it is equally important to recognize why this is happening. Almost all of the \nmost recent data and analysis surrounding adverse health outcomes, particularly mental health, in \nqueer populations refers to Meyer’s minority stress model that distinguishes the elevated levels of \nstress that individuals from stigmatized social categories are exposed to as a result of their minority \nsocial position. Meyer stipulates that there are three stress processes relevant to queer individuals, \nfrom the distal to the proximal they are: a) external, objective stressful events and conditions, both \nchronic and acute, b) expectations of such events, and c) the internalization of negative societal \nattitudes (Meyer, 2003). It is well known that queer and transgender people experience prejudice, \nharassment, and rejection at higher levels than cisgender and heterosexual people, but Meyer’s \nmodel acknowledges that even people who do not experience these negative attitudes regularly \ndevelop expectations of rejection, and as a reaction, are constantly vigilant and prepared for the \npossibility of defending themselves. \nMeyer’s model of minority stress shows not only the different levels of the socioecological \nmodel, but also the ways in which they directly interact with one another. On a societal level, norms, \nstigma, and negative narratives surrounding the lives of LGBTQ+ people are directly linked to \npersonal, interpersonal, and community outcomes. As Meyer’s model addresses, many societal \nperceptions of queer and transgender people have large effects on the personal level, with many \npeople of the LGBTQ+ community internalizing homophobia and transphobia, and constantly \nexpecting rejection. The stigma and norms also have a large part in family and peer acceptance, \nwhich has clear and studied effect on mental health outcomes in queer youth. An important \naddition that should be considered is that being a sexual or gender minority is different from other \ntypes of minority status, in that it is rarely a trait that parents share with their children, like racial or \nethnic minorities. Many parents cite this as one of the largest difficulties in supporting their children \n(P. Bekken, personal communication, October 13, 2016). Multiple minority identities may have a \ncompounding effect on social stressors, but it is difficult to make conjectures based on the data \navailable, considering most studies don’t have large enough sample sizes to make comparisons \nbetween subgroups. \nThe study of mental health of LGBTQ+ people has been heavily complicated by the debate \non the classification of homosexuality and transgenderism as mental disorders, with homosexuality \nbeing removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in the second \nedition in 1973, and “gender identity disorder” being removed only as recently as 2013, and \nreplaced with “gender dysphoria”, while “transvestic disorder” still exists in the DSM-5 (Whalen, \n2012). The history and present of “variant” sexual orientations and gender identities being \ncharacterized as mental illnesses themselves has enforced and supported stigma surrounding \nLGBTQ+ people. Multiple studies have shown that the mental health disparities discussed are \nlinked to queer identities only, not behaviors (Bostwick, Boyd, Hughes, & McCabe, 2010). People \nthat identified as heterosexual but had history of same-gender sexual interactions had similar \nlevels of anxiety, depression, and suicide attempts as their heterosexual peers without history of \nsame-gender sex. These studies are evidence that higher rates of poor mental health outcomes in \nqueer and transgender youth should not be attributed to these identities being diseases or \nillnesses, but rather as a direct outcome of the unique social stressors that LGBTQ+ people face \ndue to their perception of themselves as a stigmatized and devalued minority. \n \nSupporting Our Students Program P. 5\n   \n  \n  \nReview of Interventions \n \nTeacher Trainings to Increase Perceived School Safety in LGBTQ+ Youth \nFeelings of safety in school are consistently shown to be related to psychological distress \n(Goodenow, Szalacha, & Westheimer, 2006; Bacon, 2011). Because youth spend a majority of their \ntime and have most of their social interactions at school, changing feelings of safety and \nacceptance at school has large effects on their health. Several school factors have a direct positive \neffect on perceived safety in LGBTQ+ youth, including: peer support groups and/or gay-straight \nalliances (GSAs), LGBTQ-inclusive school anti-bullying policies and curriculum, and teacher training \non awareness of LGBTQ+ issues and intervention skills (Greytak & Kosciw, 2010; Goodenow, \nSzalacha, & Westheimer, 2006; Bacon, 2011). School-based interventions can affect health \noutcomes at a larger population level. However, because of the insular nature of the school districts \nin the Washington County area, many of these interventions cannot feasibly be directly \naccomplished by an outside party. Of these interventions, training teachers is the most realistic and \neffective, as it can create many changes indirectly and would not require an ongoing outside \npresence. Trainings for teachers have been shown to increase intervention when anti-LGBTQ+ \nbehaviors occur and increase engagement in activities that create safer schools for LGBTQ+ \nstudents, such as supporting GSAs and including LGBTQ+ content in their curriculum (Greytak & \nKosciw, 2010). The changes shown by teachers after training reduce the number of stressful \nevents that LGBTQ+ students are exposed to and increase feelings of safety, therefore reducing \npsychological distress via Meyer’s model. \nThe best practices surrounding changing school context via teacher trainings are centered \naround ideas of skill- and practice-based training. A review of a training program (Greytak & Kosciw, \n2010) found that it was successful in increasing the likelihood that teachers would intervene if they \nwitnessed anti-LGBTQ+ behaviors and building capacity to serve as a resource and support for \nLGBTQ+ students. The teachers cited the skill-based aspect as the most difficult and important \npart, warranting the most focus on that aspect during the training. One of the themes stressed \nduring interviews with seven GSAs in Washington County schools was the incredible effect that \nteachers intervening had on students’ feelings of safety in their school (personal communication, \nNovember 2016). Because of the literature and experiences of youth currently in Washington \nCounty, the program will focus on building skills of teachers to intervene as well as increasing \ncapacity to make an inclusive environment in their classroom and wider school. To make the \ntraining most specific to the county’s needs, students from the area will be involved in the process \nof developing the training curriculum. \n \nIncreasing social support through socialization opportunities and support groups \nMultiple studies have shown that an increased number of relationships with and closeness \nof relationships with other queer youth reduces internalization of negative values about their queer \nor transgender identity. (Wong, Schrager, Holloway, Meyer, & Kipke, 2014; Detrie & Lease, 2007; \nBarr, Budge, and & Adelson, 2016). Internalization of negative values is a strong predictor of \npsychological distress in queer youth in Meyer’s model and other studies, therefore, intervening at \nthis stress process can reduce psychological distress overall. Attending support groups has been \nassociated with increasing social support in queer youth, as has being a member of or semi-\ninvolved in community organizations specifically for the LGBTQ+ population (Wong et al, 2014; \nSupporting Our Students Program P. 6\n   \n  \n  \nDeml, 2013). For many members of minority and marginalized groups, a sense of belonging may \nonly be accessible within identity-specific communities.  \nThe best practices with regards to support groups and other interventions to increase social \nsupport mainly concern themselves with accessibility, content, and the level of specificity of the \ngroup. Support groups are successful because they allow participants to get support and advice \nsurrounding issues that are specific to their identities, and studies have reiterated the importance \nand success of attending to intersecting identities (Wong et al, 2014; Deml, 2013; Craig, 2013). \nThe experiences of transgender students vary widely from cisgender students, and queer students \nof color have very different experiences from white students, even if these subgroups all fall within \nthe large LGBTQ+ umbrella. Considering this, the program will have several support groups for \ndifferent subgroups of the LGBTQ+ population. Other best practices from studies on support groups \ninclude being led by a skilled moderator that is part of the identity group, focusing on developing a \npositive self and group image, and reaffirming the message that the youth are valued (Deml, 2013; \nCraig, 2013). These practices would be adopted for both the support groups and the social events. \nThere are several organizations located in Portland dedicated to queer people and youth \nspecifically, yet many students in Washington County cannot access them, citing transportation and \ndiscretion as issues (personal communication, November 2016). As such, it is important to provide \nthese opportunities locally in the county. \n \nMulti-component approach \nWhile almost all interventions focusing on reducing psychological distress work on \naddressing minority stress in some way, very few intervene at more than one of the stress \nprocesses that create mental health problems in LGBTQ+ youth. SOS is a novel program in that it \nwill use the best practices of interventions that are already tailored for LGBTQ+ youth in order to \naddress all three of Meyer’s stress processes and work on different population levels. These \ninterventions will be combined and further changed to address the most important issues in \nWashington County. \n \nSee figure on next page for visual representation of intervention design based on evidence. \nSupporting Our Students Program P. 7\n   \n  \n  \n \nFigure 1. Visual representation of evidence-based intervention design. \n \nProgram activities  \nSOS will require volunteers, as there are several components to accomplish and not enough \nresources to create paid positions. The program will be coordinated by a small board of volunteers, \ncomposed of LGBTQ+ adult community members as well as students attending Washington County \nhigh schools, to ensure that the activities are developed and conducted by and for the queer and \ntransgender community, and that the specific goals of the county are accomplished. Outside \nexperts will be secured for all three components – the teacher trainings, support groups, and social \nevents.  \nThe trainings implemented in every school will be taught by an experienced trainer, in \nconjunction with queer youth from each school, to make sure that the most important issues at \neach school are addressed. The trainers will use a practice-based curriculum focusing on \nintervention skills. Trainings with this focus have shown to increase the skills of teachers to \nintervene, and over time increase the number of times teachers intervene, reducing the level of \npeer victimization in schools (Bacon, 2011; Greytak & Kosciw, 2010). By lessening these external \nstressful factors queer youth face in school, it will also reduce their expectation of said events \nhappening, and decrease the prevalence and severity of psychological distress in queer youth in \nthe Washington County.  \nThe social events and support groups will both require physical spaces, as well as \nexperienced moderators familiar with the issues that queer youth face. The social events will have \nstructure to enable meeting new people and making friends, with activities developed to encourage \ndiscussion amongst participants. There will be several monthly support groups offered, in order for \nstudents to get the most specific peer support possible. As such, there will be a group for all \nSupporting Our Students Program P. 8\n   \n  \n  \nLGBTQ+ youth, one for transgender youth, and one for LGBTQ+ youth of color. These support \ngroups will provide the opportunity for youth to get support on identity-specific issues and \npotentially meet other youth. These support groups can increase social support as well as resiliency \nskills taught by the moderator. Both of these activities aim to increase the number and closeness of \nrelationships with other queer youth to increase self-esteem and perceived social support, as \nidentified by the literature (Detrie & Lease, 2007; Wong et al., 2014; Barr et al., 2016). By \nincreasing social support, the social events and support groups each work to reduce internalized \nnegative values about their identities, something strongly correlated to psychological distress in \nqueer youth (Detrie & Lease, 2007; Wong et al., 2014; Barr et al., 2016).   \nTogether and individually, these school and social support interventions will reduce levels of \npsychological distress in queer youth by accomplishing the following objectives: \n Collaborate with queer youth at each school to train at least 50% of teachers and \nadministrators in every high school in the Washington County area on awareness of LGBTQ+ \nissues and developing skills to intervene when witnessing anti-LGBTQ+ behaviors. \n Increase the rate of self-reported intervention by teachers and administrators in 70% of \nparticipants of training, measured 3 months after training.  \n Increase the reported number of and closeness of relationships with other queer youth in \n60% of those that participate in socialization events after one year. \n Decrease the level of internalization of negative values (measured by Meyer’s Internalized \nHomophobia Scale and adapted for transphobia as well) in 70% of youth that attend at least \ntwo support group meetings after one year. \n \nInputs / Resources Activities Outputs Short-term outcomes Long-term outcomes Impact \n-Trainers \n-Evidence-based \ncurriculum \nfocusing on skill-\nbuilding \n-LGBTQ youth at \neach school \n \n \n \n \n \n-Physical space \n-Activity \nleader/host \n-Coordinator \n \n \n \n-Moderator \n-Physical space \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-Social media \nmanager \n-Website \n-Fliers and \nadvertisements \n-Collaborate with \nqueer youth to \ndevelop curriculum \nbased on best \npractices and specific \nneeds of county \n-Training for \nteachers and admin \nabout awareness of \nLGBT issues and \nskills to intervene   \n \n-Semi-structured \nsocialization events \nfor queer and \ntransgender youth  \n \n \n \n-Three monthly \ngroups: LGBTQ+ \nyouth, transgender \nyouth, LGBTQ+ \nyouth of color \n \n \n \n \n-Outreach to queer \nyouth in schools and \nlocal organizations \n-Training held at 100% of \nhigh schools in Washington \nCounty \n-Training >50% of teachers \nand admin at each school \n-Resources for teachers \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-One event bimonthly \n-60% of attendees make at \nleast 1 new friend \n-At least 40 attendees at \neach event \n \n \n-Three monthly groups \n-30+ attendees at all queer \nyouth meeting \n-15+ attendees at trans \nyouth meeting \n-15+ attendees at queer and \ntrans youth of color \nmeeting \n \n-Number of participants at \neach event and support \ngroup \n-Increased motivation \nand skills to intervene \nin teachers and admin \n-Increased awareness \nof LGBTQ issues in \nT&A  \n-Increased dedication \nby admin to focus on \nqueer youth  \n \n \n \n-Increased number of \nqueer friends reported \nby attendees \n \n \n \n \n-Increased opportunity \nto talk about identity-\nspecific issues and get \nsupport and advice \n-Increased potential to \nmeet other queer youth \n \n \n \n -Increased number of \nparticipants \n-Increased intervention \nby teachers \n-Decreased peer \nvictimization and \nexternal stressful factors \n-Policy change and \nprograms implemented \nby administration \n \n \n \n \n-Closer relationships \nwith more queer friends \n-Increased self-esteem \n-Increased perceived \nsocial support in \nparticipants \n \n-Increased social \nsupport \n-Increased resiliency \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-Increased social \nsupport and potential to \nmake queer friends  \n-Increased feelings of \nsafety in queer youth \n-Decreased expectation \nof negative events in \nqueer youth \n-Increased positive \nmental health \noutcomes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n-Decreased \ninternalization of \nnegative values \n-Decreased \npsychological distress \n-Increased positive \nhealth outcomes \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n-More effective \nprograms through \ngreater reach of \nparticipants \n \n \nThe logic model for SOS demonstrates the relationships among program components. \nT\nE\nA\nC\nH\nE\nR\n T\nR\nA\nIN\nIN\nG\n \nS\nO\nC\nIA\nL\n E\nV\nE\nN\nT\nS\n \nS\nU\nP\nP\nO\nR\nT\n G\nR\nO\nU\nP\nS\n \nO\nU\nT\nR\nE\nA\nC\nH\n \nSupporting Our Students Program P. 10\n   \n   \n  \n  \nReferences \n \nBacon, L.

    "abstract": "Queer and transgender youth experience significant disparities in mental health outcomes, particularly with symptoms of anxiety, depression, and reported rates of suicidal ideation and completion. This is a direct outcome of the unique social stressors that LGBTQ+ people face due to their minority status. Targeted for LGBTQ+ youth in Washington County high schools, Supporting Our Students (SOS) addresses each stress process of Meyer’s minority stress model that contributes to poor mental health outcomes. To reduce stressful conditions, changing school environments is key. Using lessons learned from previous trainings, SOS will train teachers, primarily focusing on intervention skills. Internalizing negative values can be minimized by increasing social support and connectedness with other queer and transgender youth. Support groups for LGBTQ+ youth have been successful at increasing both of these measures. The program will provide identity-specific support groups for several subgroups of the community, attending to intersecting identities to allow students access to relevant support. Additionally, SOS will coordinate monthly socialization events, facilitating connections among LGBTQ+ students. By training teachers and providing support groups, we anticipate that 80% of queer and transgender students in Washington County high schools will feel safer in their schools and 60% of students that participate in support groups and/or socialization events will have higher perceived social support and connectedness after one year",
