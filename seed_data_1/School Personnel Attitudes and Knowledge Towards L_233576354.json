Overall, most LGBTQ \nstudents will experience bullying, harassment, and/or a lack of support during their time in the \nK-12 education system. Educators (N=53) provided their attitudes and knowledge regarding \nLGBTQ student issues in a high school setting. Respondents indicated that there are a variety of \nattitudes towards LGBTQ student issues, policies, and identities. Additionally, results \ndemonstrate school personnel knowledge of the subject lacks, which results in unintentional \nharm to their LGBTQ students. This suggests that more professional development opportunities \nfor educators are necessary to minimize negative LGBTQ student experiences. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  3 \nLiterature Review  \n“For Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBTQ) youth, identity development \ntypically involves awareness of one’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity that differs from \nwhat one perceives the norm” (Kosciw & Palmer, 2015, p.167). This population is often faced \nwith high levels of homophobia, internalized homophobia, harassment, victimization, and \nbullying due to their sexual orientation and gender identity (Craig, Austin, & McInroy, 2014). \nLGBTQ youth are vulnerable to high rates of depression, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, \nhomelessness, substance abuse, and criminal involvement (Craig et al., 2014). Additionally, at \nschool, it is common to see both direct and indirect harassment, belittlement, bullying, and \nsometimes even violent attacks (Hansen, 2007). Researchers also note that 49% of LGBTQ \nstudents reported that they had been cyber bullied due to their sexual orientation, gender identity, \nor gender expression (Kolbert, et al., 2015). \nLGBTQ youth are more likely than their heterosexual peers to experience a range of \nmental and emotional health risks. They are vulnerable to high rates of depression, self-harm, \nsuicidal thoughts, homelessness, substance abuse, and crime involvement. In addition, they are at \nrisk for school and academic problems, which is heightened by the homophobia, harassment, \nvictimization, and bullying they endure (Craig et al., 2014). Due to their minority status, \nadolescence becomes a challenging period of life for LGBTQ youth, especially since they are \nalready presented with other stressful circumstances during this time. They face isolation and \nlack a sense of belonging at home, school, and in their community. Additionally, they are \nsusceptible to low self-esteem and internalized homophobia (Craig et al., 2014). “Internalized \nhomophobia is an identity, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral process that involves the \npersonal adoption of negative attitudes and beliefs about homosexuality” (Amola & Grimmett, \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  4 \n2015, p. 236). Among LGBTQ youth, low self-esteem and internalized homophobia correlate \nnegatively with anxiety, depression, and psychological distress (Craig et al., 2014). As a result of \nthese daily challenges, this population exhibits the increased need for advocates and allies to \nstand by them in a school setting. As self-identified advocates, school counselors help create an \nenvironment free from abuse, bullying, neglect, harassment, or other forms of violence (Amola \n& Grimmett, 2015). Therefore, the counselor should provide a support system where LGBTQ \nyouth are treated with dignity and respect, are encouraged to reach their maximum development, \nand feel safe in the school environment (ASCA, 2010). Additionally, teachers, administrators \nand other school personnel, who regularly have direct social interactions with students, such as \nsocial workers, psychologists, and speech pathologists, should act as supporters of LGBTQ \nstudents.  \nAttitudes \nTeachers. According to Silveira and Goth (2016), the 21st century has been a time of \nhigh discrimination against sexual minorities in American schools, which is especially true for \nthe students who do not conform to gender roles. According to the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight \nEducation Network (GLSEN, 2016), 57% of transgender students reported that they heard \nnegative comments from teachers or other staff about gender expression and reported being \ntargeted by adults at school. \nA study of teachers who interact with transgender students revealed that the majority of \nmusic teachers seemed supportive of transgender issues (Silveira & Goth, 2016). However, there \nwas variability among some teachers by gender and political persuasion. Teachers who identified \nas male and more politically conservative tended to be less supportive. Furthermore, 90% of \nparticipants believed that it was the responsibility of the school staff to intervene when \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  5 \nconfronted with negative comments based on gender identity or expression (Silveira et al., 2016).  \nIt is pertinent to realize there are many teachers who agree with the importance of a safe \nenvironment for all students, but fail to provide that safety solely because of a lack of training or \ninstitutional support (Silveira et al., 2016). \nKolbert et al. (2015) noted that teachers felt the least comfortable confronting a bullying \nsituation related to sexual orientation as opposed to another special population, such as students \nwith disabilities or students with body image issues. Teachers identified that they did not address \nbullying behaviors related to LGBTQ issues as a result of apprehension of job loss, fear of \npersonal discrimination, their own judgmental thinking, and because of the potential negative \nreactions from parents, students, or other staff members. Additionally, teachers who identified as \nLGBTQ reported that they felt the school was less supportive towards LGBTQ students than did \ntheir heterosexual colleagues at the same school.  \nSchool Counselors. Supportive school counselors are instrumental to all students’ \nsuccess and safety. More specifically, counselors have a greater impact on LGBTQ students as it \nhas been found that these students typically attend school more regularly, are more willing to \ncreate post-secondary plans, and perform better academically when they can identify with a \nsupportive counselor (Kosciw, Greytak, Bartkiewicz, Boesen, & Palmer, 2012; Kosciw, Greytak, \nPalmer, & Boesen, 2014). Researchers Kosciw et al. (2014) found that LGBTQ students reported \ncounselors and teachers as favored adults to talk to about their sexual orientation and gender \nidentity over other school personnel. GLSEN (2016) reported that approximately 52% of \nstudents reported that they would feel comfortable talking to a school counselor about their \nsexual orientation or gender identity. Conversely, although it is known that LGBTQ individuals \nbegin to recognize their gender identity and sexual orientation in adolescence, counseling \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  6 \nprofessionals typically report having little to no LGBTQ individuals on their caseload (Luke et \nal., 2011), suggesting discomfort on the part of students to share with their counselors. In fact, \n51.7% of American children reported being “somewhat or very comfortable talking about \nLGBTQ issues with a mental health staff member” (GLSEN, 2016, p. 56); thus, just under half \nof LGBTQ students would not seek out support from a school counselor due to a perceived lack \nof understanding or competence in responding to LGBTQ concerns. \nAdministrators. Most students look to administration (principals and assistant \nprincipals) as leaders of their school. Administrators “may serve not only as caring adults to \nwhom the youth can turn, but they also set the tone of the school and determine specific policies \nand programs that may affect the school’s climate” (GLSEN, 2016, p. 56). In the 2016 school \nclimate survey, only 36.8% of LGBTQ students reported viewing their administration as either \nvery or somewhat supportive, while 28.5% expressed that they felt very or somewhat \nunsupported by their administration. In addition to the long-standing cultural belief that \nincorporating any form of LGBTQ inclusive curricula is inappropriate, participation of educators \nin creating supportive school environments continues to be inconsistent (Payne & Smith, 2011).  \nLevel of Knowledge \n \nTeachers. According to Payne and Smith (2011), few college or graduate level \npreparation programs require future teachers to learn about LGBTQ issues and how to handle \nthem in a school setting. Additionally, there are no states that require multicultural competence \ntraining to qualify for teacher certification. According to their research, teachers enter the \nclassroom with very little knowledge about how to handle LGBTQ issues. This lack of \nknowledge can be detrimental to student success if not recognized, since 58% of American \nLGBTQ students reported that they would be somewhat or very comfortable talking with a \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  7 \nteacher (GLSEN, 2016).  \nSchool Counselors. A school counselor’s job description calls for addressing \n“personal/social, career, and academic needs of all students, as well as to affect the overall \nschool climate” (Luke, Goodrich, & Scarborough, 2011, p. 80). Due to LGBTQ students \nremaining underserved and at a high risk in schools, counselors become instrumental in the \nsafety of LGBTQ students. According to researchers (Green, Murphy, Blumer, & Palmanteer, \n2009 as cited in Luke et al., 2011), there was a lack of focus on LGBTQ clients in counselor \ntraining; professional counselors reported being inadequately trained in graduate school and \nfeeling ill-equipped to work with LGBTQ clients/students. Only 65% of graduate students \nreported learning about LGBTQ issues in class and 46% reported having addressed it in \nsupervision. With 35% and 54% stating they are not learning or addressing LGBTQ issues in \ngraduate work, it may become problematic for practitioners when faced with an LGBTQ student \nor client, especially because they will lack crucial knowledge, awareness, and skills to intervene \neffectively (Green et al., 2009). A significant lack of LGBTQ awareness and knowledge was \nfound among school psychology, school counseling, and teacher education graduate students in \n2008 (Citation as cited in Luke et al., 2011).  A study four years later revealed that school staff \nstill recognized their lack of training in the “knowledge and skills necessary to address personal \nand systemic issues and how is affected their ability to effectively intervene with LGBT \nstudents” (Luke et al., 2011, p. 83). Lack of knowledge, skills, and awareness could lead to \nunintentional harm and/or ethical and legal breaches (Luke et al., 2011).  \nAdministrators. Although there is little research on administrators’ level of knowledge \nabout LGBTQ issues, 65.3 % of American LGBTQ students reported that they had concerns \nabout how administrators would react if they reported an LGBTQ related bullying or harassment \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  8 \nincident. Students stated that they felt embarrassed, ashamed, or worried the staff member would \nblame or discipline them for reporting an incident. Additionally, 29.3% of students reported that \nthey thought certain adults were homophobic or transphobic, which clouded their potential \nrelationship with that adult (GLSEN, 2016). The most troubling statistic is that 10.3% of students \nreported that adults at school were engaging in harassment behaviors towards the students. Not \nonly is this behavior unacceptable according to school policy, but it also sends a message that \nbullying and/or harassment is a norm for the school setting (GLSEN, 2016). Harassment of \nstudents by school personnel also serves as a reminder that safer school efforts must address all \nmembers of the school community, and not just the student body (GLSEN, 2016, p. 30).  Perhaps \nthese statistics suggest that administrators are lacking the knowledge to appropriately react and \nrespond to certain LGBTQ student issues. By participating in education related to LGBTQ \nissues, perhaps adults would handle these situations differently and more appropriately. \nBased on the aforementioned statistics regarding general teacher, school counselor, and \nadministrator knowledge about LGBTQ issues, it is pertinent to explore options for all school \npersonnel to engage in to better understand the complexities of LGBTQ issues, policies, student \nexperiences, and how to better support and LGBTQ inclusive environment. \nContinued Education \n During the past decade, there have been multiple organizations pushing for LGBTQ \ninclusive curriculum (e.g., Safe Space Ally Programs, Reduction of Stigma Programs, Safe Zone \nprogramming), all of which aim to educate students, faculty, and staff about LGBTQ issues in \nschools. By educating school personnel, it is more likely they are supportive, perceptive, and \nunderstanding of their LGBTQ students’ concerns (GLSEN, 2016). The goal of Safe Space Ally \nPrograms was to organize and administer a program to staff of schools and colleges about \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  9 \nLGBTQ issues (Poynter & Tubbs, 2008). Creators proposed that an “advisory board consisting \nof staff, faculty members, and students [may] have the responsibility of coordination, \nrecruitment, and training” (p. 123) and determine how to properly organize safe space \nprogramming for the school, college, or university. The Safe Space Ally Program was designed \nto include introductions, ground rules, campus and local resources, terminology, LGBTQ and \nally panel discussion, LGBT development theory and ally/majority developmental theory, role \nplays and case exercises, video scenarios, and conclude with signing a contract, values statement, \nand receive a Safe Zone sticker (Poytner & Tubbs, 2008).  \nThere are also organizations, such as the LGBTQ Academy at the Out Alliance in \nRochester, New York that aim to foster LGBTQ inclusive education— a program very similar to \nSafe Space Ally Program. “The goal of the LGBTQ Academy at the Out Alliance is to encourage \nall of our social systems to become inclusive and welcoming to lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, queer/questioning (LGBTQ) and allied individuals. Our 43 years of experience \noffering LGBTQ education and our quality trainings have us presenting to a wide variety of \nclients all around the country. Our sessions are custom designed and continually updated to \nremain relevant” (Out Alliance, 2017). The LGBTQ Academy at the Out Alliance offers \ntrainings that include, but are not limited to, Safe Zone, Safe Schools, Transgender Basics, and \nLGBTQ 101. One hundred percent of participants that trained with the Out Alliance state that the \ntrainings were educational, beneficial, engaging, and interactive (Out Alliance, 2017). \nAnother approach was an activist-driven programming delivered outside of school, \nbuilding on an educator-to-educator program inside the school (Payne & Smith, 2011); the intent \nwas to create opportunities to share knowledge and tools with more educators who may be \nhesitant to learn about the topic. The Reduction of Stigma in Schools (RSIS) was born through \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  10 \nPayne and Smith’s ideas of a more engaged and connected school community. This program was \nbased on five components— (1) educator-to-educator model, (2) professional development in \nhouse so that educators who are resistant have a better chance of engaging in a training, (3) \nconnections between examples from the school and the training will be made, (4) program is \nresearch-based, and (5) adequate time for the training. The trainings were designed to be tailored \nto the experiences of each individual school and to be evaluated in order to improve the training \neach time. \nLiterature Review Conclusion \nBased on the several programs proposed to foster LGBTQ inclusive education for \neducators, it is promising that as time progresses, more education, knowledge, and positive \nattitudes will arise surrounding LGTBQ issues in schools. These programs are not only to help \neducators understand the content of LGBTQ identities, but to assist them in finding ways to \nsupport LGBTQ students in schools through empathy, LGBTQ inclusive curriculum, providing \nSafe Zones, and realizing that LGBTQ issues should be a part of professional development \nopportunities. \nDue to research that indicated high levels of harassment led to lower levels of educational \nattainment, lower income, and other outcomes such as homelessness or suicide (Silveira & Goth, \n2016), it is critical that teachers and other school staff be sensitive and knowledgeable about \nLGBTQ students needs and experiences. \nIt seems as though teacher attitudes towards LGBTQ students vary. As noted above, \nsome teachers demonstrate strong support, which is noticed by students, and in other cases there \nhave been teachers that think they are supportive but the way LGBTQ students perceive them \ndiffers. In order to examine the differences in attitudes across all positions in a school, it is \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  11 \nimportant to highlight the attitudes of school counselors and administrators, as well. Encouraging \nthe school environment to be more inclusive will be most reliant on the administrators \nimplementing changes. \nResearch Questions \nThis research project aims to answer the following questions: What are the attitudes and \namount of knowledge of school personnel towards LGBTQ student issues? Based on the results, \nwould it be beneficial for the participants to engage in further professional development \nregarding LGBTQ students?   \nMethods \nParticipants \nAll high school staff at a suburban high school in western New York were invited to \nparticipate in the study. The respondents represented a convenience sample of those from the \ntotal population of high school educators. A total of 53 participants completed the survey. Sixty-\nsix percent (n = 35) identified as female, 26.4% (n = 14) identified as male, and 7.5% (n = 4) did \nnot identify gender. Ninety point six percent (n = 48) identified as white, 1.9% (n = 1) as Asian \nAmerican, and 7.5% (n = 4) did not identify race. Eighty-four point nine percent (n = 45) \nidentified as straight, 1.9% (n = 1) identified as gay, 1.9% (n =1) identified as lesbian, 1.9% (n = \n1) as bisexual, and 9.4% (n = 5) did not identify sexual orientation.  \nInstrument \nThe instrument was comprised of 20 multiple-choice questions and five open-ended \ndemographic information questions; ten questions were about the participants’ attitudes and ten \nquestions about their level of knowledge. Each multiple-choice question had the options of true, \nfalse, or unsure as responses. The ten attitude items were adapted from Hebl (2000). The \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  12 \ninstrument was developed as an electronic survey through Google Forms. All participants \nreceived a link to the survey via their staff email. \nProcedure \nAll staff at at the school were invited to participate in a survey; first through verbal \ncommunication by the researcher, and then via a link attached to a staff email. The instrument \nrequired approximately 10 minutes to complete. A follow-up email was sent out after 2 weeks \nreminding participants to complete the survey. Another reminder was sent 2 weeks after the first \nreminder alerting participants that there was one week left to complete the survey. In total, the \nparticipants had 5 weeks to complete the survey. The survey responses were automatically \nrecorded in the secure Google Forms database. \nResults \nThe data was analyzed descriptively. The results are reported in two tables; Table 1 (see \nAppendix A) consists of the responses to the ‘attitude’ questions and Table 2 (see Appendix B) \nconsists of the ‘knowledge’ questions. The following responses were used for the analysis: true, \nfalse, and unsure. The attitudes that the greatest number of participants identified as true were \nitem 11: “I am comfortable confronting a student who harasses another student because of their \nsexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression” (92%), followed by item 13: \n“Openly LGBTQ staff members are important role models for our students” (87%). The \nquestions that greatest number of participants identified as false were item 3: “LGBTQ students \nnever get harassed or bullied at school” (91%) followed by item 7: “My personal values make \nme uncomfortable with the school policy that prohibits any form of discrimination on the basis \nof sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression” (87%). The question that the \ngreatest number of participants identified as unsure was item 9: “Name-calling or harassment on \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  13 \nthe basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression has been an issue at this \nschool” (57%). In the second table, the knowledge question that the greatest number of \nparticipants identified as true was item 16: “There is a Gay Straight Alliance club at Arcadia \nHigh School” (92%) followed by item 10: “An ally is someone who is not a member of the \nLGBTQ community, but advocates for their rights” (75%). The questions that greatest number of \nparticipants identified as false were item 4: “Biological sex and gender identity are the same \nthing” (94%) followed by item 6: “Sexual orientation and gender identity are the same thing” \n(89%). The question that the greatest number of participants identified as unsure was item 20: \n“LGBTQ students report feeling more comfortable talking to an adult with a SAFE ZONE \nsticker or pin displayed” (75%). \nDiscussion \nHigh school educators prepare young individuals to be contributing members of society. \nMuch of the work done by high school educators determines whether students will complete high \nschool, engage in post-secondary plans, and be well-rounded individuals. The initial question \nthat guided this research sought to understand the attitudes and knowledge of school personnel \ntowards LGTBQ students. If there is a perceived negative attitude and/or lack of knowledge \nabout LGBTQ issues, educators are doing the LGBTQ student population a disservice. This \nstudy provided an opportunity for high school educators to report on their attitudes and \nknowledge about LGBTQ student issues. The findings reflect much of which was found in the \nliterature— high levels of perceived bullying/harassment towards LGBTQ students (GLSEN, \n2016; Kolbert et al., 2015), lack of educational training/preparedness on LGBTQ student issues \n(Payne & Smith, 2011; Green  et al., 2009), and high level of need for professional development \non the topic (Poytner & Tubbs, 2008; Payne & Smith, 2011) \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  14 \nAttitudes \nThe survey found that 61.8% of educators believe the school as a whole provides a safe \nenvironment for LGBTQ students. Conversely, 90.9% of staff answered ‘true’ for the question, \n“LGBTQ students never get harassed or bullied at school.” While it seems like a majority of \nresponders believe the school provides a safe environment, they also admit that LGBTQ students \nare victims of bullying/harassment. Based on the results, there is a clear disparity between the \nresponders’ perception of a safe environment and the actual needs of the LGBTQ population. \nAlthough a safe school environment cannot prevent outright any bullying or harassment, the \noverwhelming majority affirming the existence of bullying suggests it is a regular and \nacknowledged aspect of school life. Relating back to Kolbert et al. (2015), faculty might easily \naccept that challenges exist for the LGBTQ population, but not have the appropriate knowledge \non how to best approach them. Similarly, they might believe the school is already doing its best \nto create the safest environment possible. \n \nKnowledge \n \n The survey found that majority of staff chose the correct answer to the knowledge based \nquestions. These questions aimed to gauge the level of knowledge educators had about factual \ninformation within the LGBTQ identities. For example, item 1 stated “Gender identity and \ngender expression are the same thing,” which is a false statement according to the Out Alliance \n(2017). Seventy-two percent of staff chose the correct false response indicating that they \nunderstand that gender identity and gender expression are separate entities. While not a perfect \nscore, having faculty knowledgeable about the characteristics of the LGBTQ identity is helpful \nfor building a safer environment.  \nThere was uncertainty, however, in the response for the last question— item 20, which \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  15 \nstated “LGBTQ students report feeling more comfortable talking to an adult with a SAZFE \nZONE sticker or pin displayed.” Twenty-five percent of participants were uncertain if this \nstatistic is true, but according to the Out Alliance (2017), individuals have reported feeling more \ncomfort with those who outwardly denote their support for LGBTQ individuals. Outward \nsupport can be a simple way to help foster a safer environment this underserved population, yet it \nis unclear whether the faculty is unaware of its effectiveness, or resistant due to other, more \npersonal reasons. Again, it is beneficial for faculty to have an understanding of the LGBTQ \npopulations, but the next crucial step is knowing how to improve the safety of the school \nenvironment. \n \nLimitations \n \nIt should be noted that there are three noticeable limitations to this study: (1) value of the \nquestions, (2) time constraint, and (3) sample size. The response options for the questions were \nlimited; because participants were only given three responses as an option, there left little room \nfor scaled responses, which could have lead to greater meaning of the responses. A Likert scale \nformat might have been a better option. The survey was only open for five weeks. In future \nresearch, more time for participants to complete the survey may be beneficial in order to ensure \nall participants have ample time to complete it. Lastly, it is important to note that the participants \nwere chosen by a convenience sample and is not representative of all high school personnel \npopulations. In a different district, high school personnel’s responses could vary based on the \nexperiences, attitudes, and knowledge they have gained throughout their career. To develop a \ngreater understanding of regional high school personnel, a county-wide survey might be a \nproductive next step. \nImplications for Counselors \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  16 \nEvery School Counselor is ethically responsible to support 100% of students in their \nacademic, career, and social/emotional development (ASCA, 2016) It is pertinent that counselors \ninsert themselves and advocate for students when they are being harassed/bullied based on \ngender identity, sexual orientation, and/or gender expression. Counselors should also engage in \nprofessional development opportunities to better understand the complexities of the LGBTQ \nstudent body, as the topic is rapidly changing. Additionally, it is important that counselors \nadvocate for and encourage all school personnel to seek appropriate professional development. \nConclusion \n This study confirms the existing discord between school faculty and LGBTQ students \ndue to wide-ranging attitudes and levels of knowledge towards the marginalized population. The \nsurveyed personnel were found to have generally positive attitudes toward LGBTQ students and \nwere knowledgeable about basic characteristics of the LGBTQ students. There was, however, \nsome discrepancy between the social-emotional challenges this group currently faces and the \nfaculty’s perception of an adequately safe environment. In order for high school educators to \nserve 100% of their students, professional development opportunities are crucial for \nstrengthening their knowledge on how to best assist LGBTQ students. Further research should \nfocus on expanding the sample to account for faculty with a greater variety of personal \nexperiences. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS LGBTQ STUDENTS  17 \n \nReferences \n  \nAmerican School Counseling Association.

    "abstract": "Literature highlights areas of discord for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning/Queer (LGBTQ) students in the school setting as well as teacher, administrator, and school counselor attitudes and knowledge about LGBTQ students. Overall, most LGBTQ students will experience bullying, harassment, and/or a lack of support during their time in the K-12 education system. Educators (N=53) provided their attitudes and knowledge regarding LGBTQ student issues in a high school setting. Respondents indicated that there are a variety of attitudes towards LGBTQ student issues, policies, and identities. Additionally, results demonstrate school personnel knowledge of the subject lacks, which results in unintentional harm to their LGBTQ students. This suggests that more professional development opportunities for educators are necessary to minimize negative LGBTQ student experiences",
