Less is known about prevalence of risks within these populations.ObjectivesThe first systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of risks amongyoung people throughout the LGBTQ+ umbrella with experiences across the dimension ofself-harm, suicidal ideation and suicide behaviour; and how they may differ betweenLGBTQ+ umbrella groups.Data sourcesMEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science searches were run to iden-tify quantitative research papers (database inception to 31st January, 2020).Study eligibility criteriaArticles included were empirical quantitative studies, which examined risks associated withself-harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour in LGBTQ+ young people (12–25 years).Synthesis methods2457 articles were identified for screening which was completed by two independent review-ers. 104 studies met inclusion criteria of which 40 had data which could be meta-analysed ina meaningful way. This analysis represents victimisation and mental health difficulties asrisks among LGBTQ+ youth with self-harm and suicide experiences. Random-effectsmodelling was used for the main analyses with planned subgroup analyses.PLOS ONEPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 1 / 26a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111OPEN ACCESSCitation: Williams AJ, Jones C, Arcelus J,Townsend E, Lazaridou A, Michail M (2021) Asystematic review and meta-analysis ofvictimisation and mental health prevalence amongLGBTQ+ young people with experiences of self-harm and suicide.

A pooled prevalence of 0.36 was indicated for victimi-sation and 0.39 for mental health difficulties within LGBTQ+ young people with experiencesof self-harm or suicide. Odds ratios were calculated which demonstrated particularly highlevels of victimisation (3.74) and mental health difficulties (2.67) when compared to cisgen-der, heterosexual counterparts who also had these experiences.ConclusionsVictimisation and mental health difficulties are highly prevalent among LGBTQ+ youth withexperiences of self-harm and suicide. Due to inconsistency of reporting, further risk synthe-sis is limited. Given the global inclusion of studies, these results can be considered acrosscountries and inform policy and suicide prevention initiatives.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42019130037.IntroductionWorldwide, suicide is one of the leading causes of death for young people [1], with adolescentsuicide rates between 11.2–12.7 per 100,000 across low-, middle-, and high-income countries[2]. Suicidal thoughts and attempt are thought to be around 3 times higher among sexual ori-entation minorities (Lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning or queer, LGBQ) youth when com-pared to heterosexual, cisgender counterparts [3]. A recent meta-analysis found suicidalideation prevalence was demonstrated to be around 28% among gender identity minoritygroups (transgender and gender non-conforming, TGNC) and suicidal attempt prevalencewas 14.8% [4]. Self-harm (defined as self-injury or self-poisoning of self, irrespective of suicidalintent [5]) is known as the most influential risk factor for completed suicide among youngpeople [6,7]. There is also strong evidence that demonstrates the high prevalence of self-harmamong young people who identify as LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queeror Questioning, and others) [8]. Within LGBQ youth self-harm was reported by 65% of thesample whilst around 46% of TGNC samples have also reported this type of behaviour [9,10].Among young people generally, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, risksassociated with experiences of self-harm and suicide are numerous, ranging from childhoodneglect to poor academic performance [11,12]. Given this, risk factors are often put into broadcategories; demographic, psychosocial, mental health, or psychopathology etc. [13–15]. Withina category such as demographic risks, the individual risk factor can also range widely e.g. age[16], race [17,18] or education level [19]. Additionally, certain populations may also experiencerisks which are only influential to that specific group of individuals. LGBTQ+ young people areoften exposed to additional stressors which are specifically related to their sexual orientationand gender identity when compared to cisgender heterosexual peers, such as institutionalisedprejudice, social pressure and victimisation [20–22]. Among the LGBTQ+ umbrella there isalso variation of how prevalent a risk may be to a subgroup. For example, someone who is out-wardly gender nonconforming may receive more harassments than a cisgender member of theLGBTQ+ umbrella. Therefore, it is possible that there is another layer of risks which TGNCyoung people face. Gender nonconformity, gender dysphoria, and frustrations due to the longPLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 2 / 26Funding: This project was funded as part of anEconomic and Social Research Council grant onthe Doctoral Training Pathway.

Although we know thatnegative experiences such as institutional prejudice, social pressures, victimisation are associ-ated with self-harm or suicide among those who identify as LGBTQ+ young people [20–22,24],less is known about how prevalent these experiences may be within this population. This sys-tematic review seeks to comprehensively investigate the prevalence of all risks within LGBTQ+ young people who have a history of self-harm, suicidal ideation or attempt. Previous reviewsin this population specifically focus on a category of self-harm and suicide; either non-suicidalself-injury or suicide excluding self-harm [25,26]. However, we aim to investigate outcomesacross the dimension of self-harm, irrespective of intent, suicidal ideation and attempt to con-sider differences and similarities within risk prevalence by outcome among LGBTQ+ youngpeople. This will allow us to explore risks across the dimensional structure of self-destructivethoughts and behaviours [27] and consider the comparison of risk across the continuum of sui-cidal intent. Furthermore, previous reviews have not looked at the prevalence of risk factors forself-harm and suicide across the full LGBTQ+ umbrella, therefore, losing comparability of riskswithin this broad population [28]. In this study, we consider LGBTQ+ young people as a wholegroup, and then by sexual orientation minority and gender identity minority groups.Objectives1. To investigate, for the first time, the prevalence of risks associated with the full dimensionof self-harm, suicidal ideation or attempts in LGBTQ+ young people who have theseexperiences.2. To investigate whether there is a difference in the prevalence of risks between young peoplewho identify as a sexual orientation minority (LGBQ) alongside those who identify as a gen-der identity minority (TGNC).MethodsProtocol and registrationThis review was conducted and reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (SM1) [29].An a-priori protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019130037), and the full protocolwas published in 2019 [30]. As this is a systematic review and meta-analysis of published litera-ture, ethical approval was not sought.Search strategyDuring March 2019, a literature search strategy was developed with an academic skills special-ist at the University of Birmingham. An electronic search was conducted on the 31st of March2019 using MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. This was updatedon the 31st of January 2020. There was no date limit for identified articles, however only thosein English language were considered. Search terms (and their derivatives) focused on the vari-ables of interest; “self-harm”, “suic�”, “adolescent�”, “young person�”, “sexual orientation”,“gender identity” and “risk�”, see Fig 1. The reference list of included articles and key paperswithin the field were examined for further relevant publications.Inclusion criteriaArticles included in this systematic review were empirical quantitative studies, which exam-ined risks across the dimension of self-harm and suicide in LGBTQ+ young people (12–25PLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 3 / 26years). This age range covers the period of adolescence and early adulthood [31]. An associatedrisk is operationalised as “an exposure that is statistically related in some way to an outcome”[32; p1], such as significant effect sizes, correlations, mediators, moderators, beta statistics, orany prevalence available relating to an outcome of self-harm or suicide. Mixed-method studydesigns were included if the quantitative aspects were relevant and extractable. Papers wereincluded if they provided a self-reported or verified group who identified as a sexual orienta-tion or gender identity minority, and any outcome of across the dimension of self-harm andsuicide. Studies, whose population were not focused on any sexual orientation or gender iden-tity minorities, were included if they presented information for LGBTQ+ participants sepa-rately or if authors were able to offer this information when contacted. Full inclusion criteriaare described in Table 1.Study selectionThe results of the systematic search are presented in Fig 2. Overall, the searches yielded 2457results; 96 duplicates were removed. Studies were screened for eligibility at title, abstract andfull-text by two independent researchers (AJW and AL) following the PRISMA guidelines[29]. Following the removal of duplications, 2361 were title and abstract screened. If agreementregarding the eligibility of an article could not be met through discussion, a third researcher(MM) was invited to review. This process was repeated at full-text screening for 465 articles,Fig 1.

PRISMA flow diagram.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268.g002PLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 5 / 26which produced a very high inter-rater reliability (Prevalence- And Bias-Adjusted Kappa,PABAK = 0.948) [33]. This was used due to PABAK being a more stable indicator of inter-rater reliability than Cohen’s Kappa [34].Data extractionA modified version of the data extraction tool used in a previous systematic review was utilisedby two independent authors (AJW, AL) to extract data on study design, participants, outcomedetails, and associated risk [35]. After extraction was completed and checked, any disagree-ments were discussed and resolved by the research team. Risks were extracted based on a sig-nificant relationship to self-harm or suicide outcome. This has the potential to producemultiple reporting of the same study, as the risk may be reporting different outcomes for thesame population or the same risk reported for multiple subgroups. For example, within onestudy, victimisation may be significantly associated with self-harm and suicidal ideation, bothof which have an effect size. This would then be extracted twice to yield both sets of informa-tion. Initially, outcomes were combined into a single quantitative outcome [36]. Thereby, theoverall prevalence of this risk for self-harm and suicide could be observed. Further analysisconsidered the risk to each outcome individually. The inclusion of multiple reporting from asingle study may have resulted in a reduction in confidence intervals for the random effectsmodel as the sample sizes will be included numerous times.Risk of bias assessmentTo assess quality within the literature, variations of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) wereemployed [35–38]. This allowed a number of study designs to be considered and assessed. Theforms assess risk of bias based on three core aspects of study design: participant selection, com-parability of participants, and exposure ascertainment. These were adapted for this systematicreview (see SM3), and rated as either low, moderate or high quality using the same categorydistinctions as previous research [39]. The two reviewers assessed the quality of studies inde-pendently, with intermediate agreement (PABAK = 0.43). Agreement was achieved throughdiscussion.Data synthesisThe search strategy yielded 104 primary articles, across 102 studies. Given the large number ofindividual risk factors, similar variables were categorised resembling the format used by previ-ous literature [40]; demographic, psychosocial, mental health difficulties. Rather than use “psy-chiatric or mental health” however, mental health difficulties was selected due to self-reportmeasures commonly being used, the inclusion of symptomology, and limited informationregarding diagnosis of mental health conditions. Additionally, two categories of risk were cre-ated, victimisation and LGBTQ+ specific risks. Victimisation includes individual measureswhich considered the process of the LGBTQ+ young person being treated poorly, harassed,abuse or discriminated against or subjected to bullying. LGBTQ+ specific risks included riskswhich were strongly related to the LGBTQ+ identity held by the young person, e.g. comingout stress [41], parent being unaware of sexual orientation [42], or negative attitudes towardshomosexuality [43]. Risks were classed as victimisation if they suggested direct negative actionagainst the individual, e.g. discrimination, bullying, harassment or threat. Victimisation wasselected as representative title as it most often occurred within the studies. Risks which wereboth victimisation and LGBTQ+ specific, such as trans, bi, and homophobic bullying, werecategorised as victimisation.PLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 6 / 26There was a large amount of inconsistency among individual risks for three categories:demographic, psychosocial and LGBTQ+ specific risks. This did not allow for meaningful clus-tering of variables into meta-analysis which would provide a prevalence of risk among LGBTQ+ young people who had experiences of self-harm or suicide. Furthermore, numerical evidencewas not available for many individual risks; in these instances, either there was no statisticallysignificant statistics available for associated risks, effect sizes, correlations, mediators, modera-tors, beta statistics, or any reporting of prevalence. Numerical data was predominantly avail-able within victimisation and mental health difficulties; therefore these risks were analysed.The 65 studies not included in meta-analysis due to are briefly described by risk category, andseparated by population (e.g. sexual orientation minority, gender identity minority, LGBTQ+ umbrella).Numerical analysisA meta-analysis was conducted for two risks associated with self-harm and suicide amongLGBTQ+ young people; victimisation and mental health difficulties, where sufficient data foraggregation were available. For these two risks, outcome data from forty primary studies weresynthesised. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to 1) to investigate the prevalence of victimisa-tion and mental health difficulties associated with self-harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal attemptamong LGBTQ+ young people with these experiences; 2) to investigate whether there is a differ-ence in the prevalence of victimisation and mental health difficulties among those young peoplewho identify as a sexual orientation minority (LGBQ) and those who identify as a gender identityminority (TGNC); 3) to identify whether the prevalence of victimisation and mental health diffi-culties is different in LGBTQ+ young people who have experiences of self-harm, suicidal ideationor attempt compared with cisgender heterosexual young people with these experiences.Event rates of primary studies were log transformed before numerical syntheses such thatthey were all the same unit of measure (but back-transformed for clear presentation in tables).Studies with an event rate of zero or one were excluded from analysis as studies with a smallsample size do not permit accurate estimations of event rate. Where data was available for thetarget population subgroup and a control subgroup of cisgender and heterosexual individuals,odds ratios were calculated.The random effects model was used as this assumes that not all studies have the samepower to detect effects, therefore, a common effect size cannot be assumed. As the study effectswere normally distributed, the DerSimonian and Laird method was selected to determine thevariation between the studies to fit the random effects model [44]. The random effects modelwas extended to include explicit consideration of the methodological quality of the primarystudies. This “quality effects model” (QEM) used the NOS total score to characterise the overallquality of the study. This QEM model can be interpreted as the meta-analytic synthesis thatwould have been obtained if all the studies had been of the same methodological quality as thehighest rated study within the review, thereby providing a measure of attenuation to the meth-odological variation of included studies.Higgins I2 was used to determine the level of heterogeneity within the primary studies witha value of above 75% considered problematic. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to identifystudies disproportionately influencing results. Such studies were excluded from subsequentanalyses due to the high risk of bias. Subgroup analysis was also used to aid the identificationof sources of problematic heterogeneity.Publication bias and small study effects were also estimated by inspection of funnel plots. Inabsence of publication bias, high precision studies will be evidenced near the average, withlower precision studies spread evenly and symmetrically on both sides of the average, creatingPLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 7 / 26a funnel-shaped distribution. Publication bias is indicated by the absence of studies in the areaof the final plot associated with small (i.e. non-significant) effect sizes in small studies.If publication bias was evidenced then a trim and fill procedure was undertaken. This pro-duced an adjusted effect size (controlling for publication bias), and the impact of publicationbias was assessed by comparison with the uncorrected random effects model. The fail-safe Nwas also calculated using the Orwin algorithm [45]. This is the estimation of missing studiesthat was required to render the effect non-significant. If the fail-safe N is large (in relation tothe number of studies included in the synthesis), then the synthesis could be considered robustto the effects of publication bias.Before searches were conducted, two a-priori hypotheses were established to consider het-erogeneity which may occur within the data [30]. The first suggested that heterogeneity maybe explained by consideration of sexual orientation (LGBQ) and gender identity minorities(TGNC) as separate populations. This allows us to determine whether there are similar levelsof risk within both groups. The second a-priori aim was to consider risk by age group; how-ever, this was not possible given the final dataset. Additionally, a subgroup analysis was runbased on the type of outcomes reported: self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempt.Summary effects and associated heterogeneity measures were calculated for each subgroup,the significance of difference between these being evaluated by the comparison of their 95%confidence intervals.ResultsOne-hundred and four papers from 102 studies were included, which met all the inclusion cri-teria and contained extractable significant risks associated with self-harm, suicidal ideation, orsuicidal attempt. Twenty-six studies examined a form of self-harm (e.g. self-harm with suicidalintent, self-harm intent unspecified, non-suicidal-self-injury) whereas 77 considered ideationand 76 considered behaviour, studies often considered more than one outcome. None of thestudies included information on participants who died by suicide. Two of the included papers[46,47] utilised the same dataset as a previously included study [48,49]. These were included asseparate papers, given that they highlight risk factors which the primary study did not. Themajority of studies were cross-sectional (n = 91); with 10 longitudinal studies, and 3 cohortstudies. A total of 1,146,395 participants were included, with 129,469 (11.3%) being LGBQ and13,041 (1.1%) being TGNC. Ages ranged from 12–25 (M = 17.7, SD = 1.9). Studies weremainly based within the U.S.A (n = 77), followed by the U.K. (n = 7), and China (n = 4). Forfull individual study characteristics, see supplementary materials 4 tables A [17,18,41,43,49–109] and B [16,23,42,47,110–144] (SM3) in S1 Table. From this document, further figuresregarding heterogeneity and influential studies are also available.From the 104 included papers, 64 were unable to be numerically synthesised[17,18,41,43,49–109]. The individual characteristics of these studies can be seen in Supplemen-tary Table A (SM3) in S1 Table. The population of these papers represented a total of 929,802individuals, of whom 90,767 were LGBTQ+ identifying (9.76%). Therefore, these studies areconsidered 81.1% of the overall population. These studies did evidence multiple risks associ-ated with experiences of self-harm and suicide among LGBTQ+ young people. The individualrisk factors were varied and numerous to the extent that they could not be individually consid-ered in relation to prevalence. However, by categorising these broadly, some information canbe gained.Most of the papers which were not numerically synthesised, focused on samples which onlyconsidered sexual orientation minorities, see Table 2. With fewer studies examining TGNCpopulations or across the LGBTQ+ umbrella. Across all populations, psychosocial risks werePLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 8 / 26most commonly cited in associated with self-harm and suicide. Victimisation and mentalhealth difficulties were evident, although without reinforcing numerical evidence.1. Meta-analysis: VictimisationA random effects model was calculated, using the generic inverse variance method, toexamine the prevalence of victimisation as a risk associated with experiences of self-harm,suicidal ideation or suicidal attempt among LGBTQ+ young people. Sixty-three estimatesfrom 31 individual samples were reported, representing 331,321 participants in total. Therandom effects models reported a pooled prevalence estimate of 0.33 and a 95% confidenceinterval of between 0.29–0.38 among LGBTQ+ young people with self-harm or suicideexperiences.A high level of between study variation (heterogeneity) could not be attributed to differ-ences in individual reaction to victimisation within the included studies (Higgin’s I2 = 99%).Therefore, the prevalence estimates of the primary studies may be influenced by the presenceof uncontrolled or confounding factors. Given this substantial level of heterogeneity, theimpact of disproportionately influential individual studies was assessed using a leave-one-outanalysis. Following this, Taliaferro and Muehlenkamp (2017) [137] was removed from themeta-analysis [137]. This was due to a variable being extracted multiple times as numericaldata was given per sexual orientation, this resulted in a large volume of included variables.Therefore, this study was overtly overrepresented within the sample.The random effects model was recalculated with 55 measures of prevalence from 30 uniquesamples. The corrected random effects model reported a pooled prevalence estimate of 0.36(95%CI: 0.31–0.40) (Fig 3). The corrected random effects model did not impact heterogeneity(Higgin’s I2 = 99%). Accordingly, the observed heterogeneity could not be considered to bethe result of overly influential individual studies, and therefore other sources of heterogeneityrequire exploration.The Quality Effects Model was calculated using the total score from the risk of bias ratings,(individual study ratings can be found in SM3). The QEM can be interpreted as the meta-analytic synthesis that would have been obtained had all the studies been of the same meth-odological quality as the best study within the review. This reported an estimate of 0.36 (95%CI: 0.31–0.41). Given the similarity between the random effects model and the synthesisderived from the quality effects model, it is possible to conclude that the ratings of methodo-logical quality did not have a significant and substantial impact upon the estimates ofprevalence.Table 2.

Thus, the observed effect is considered robust to publication bias.Fig 3. Forest plot of victimisation prevalence among LGBTQ+ with experiences of self-harm or suicide.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268.g003PLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 10 / 26To further assess the impact of methodological variation upon heterogeneity, a series ofsubgroup analyses were conducted (Table 3). The first considered risk of bias ratings; low,moderate, and high quality (Q = 19.5, p< 0.01). Both high-rated and low-rated studies evi-denced higher prevalence than those rated as moderate quality.Subgroup analysis was utilised to explore the impact of uncontrolled covariates upon victimi-sation. Initially, this evaluated differences in prevalence of victimisation between groups of sexualorientation (LGBQ) or gender identity groups (TGNC) with these experiences of self-harm andsuicide. This analysis was to explore whether a particular identity group experiences greater victi-misation than others. Studies which combined the populations or looked at just one representa-tion of LGBQ were excluded from this analysis. The subgroup analysis showed that prevalencerates of victimisation were relatively consistent across all gender identity and sexual orientationstudies/groups (Q = 0.11, p = 0.74). However, heterogeneity was notably lower within the TGNCstudies. This may be related to a small number of studies being included, as analysis of LGBQ tri-ples the study sample. Following this, subgroup analysis was conducted regarding outcome.Again, studies were excluded if they collapsed two distinct categories; suicidal ideation and sui-cidal attempt. Studies with self-harm as outcome demonstrated an overall victimisation preva-lence rate of 39%. This suggests that higher rates of victimisation are associated with self-harmwhen compared to suicidal thoughts or attempts among LGBTQ+ participants.The prevalence of victimisation within LGBTQ+ young people with experiences of self-harm or suicide was compared to matched cisgender, heterosexual control counterparts.These young people also had experiences of self-harm or suicide. The odds ratios (19 estimatesfrom 12 studies) were synthesised using the generic inverse variance. An odds ratio of 4.82(CI: 3.67–6.32) was reported. Between studies heterogeneity was high (I2 = 98%) suggestinguncontrolled methodological or conceptual factors contributing variations in reported risks.Therefore, a leave-one-out analysis was conducted to identify studies that might be exerting adisproportionate influence on the overall meta-analysis. One study was identified as both het-erogeneous and influential, demonstrated by a change of effect of over 13%. Thus, Turpin andcolleagues’ study was removed to give a more conservative overall odds ratio [139].The following meta-analysis was based on the remaining 16 odds ratios from 12 studies.This produced a synthesised odds ratio of 3.74 (95% CI: 2.90–4.84)(Fig 4). The corrected ran-dom effects model produced very little change to the heterogeneity level, (Higgin’s I2 = 98%).Given the small number of studies, further analyses including an assessment for publicationbias were not feasible.Table 3.

Meta-analysis: Mental health difficultiesA second random effects model was calculated to consider the prevalence of previous mentalhealth difficulties within LGBTQ+ young people who have an experience of self-harm, suicidalideation or suicidal attempt. A total of 166,810 participants were assessed over 22 studieswhich produced 51 estimates. The model calculated a prevalence of mental health difficultiesof 0.36 (95% CI: 0.29–0.43). Again, a high level of heterogeneity was found (Higgin’s I2 =99%). A leave-one-out analysis was therefore run, with the influential studies being evaluatedfor inclusion. Studies were omitted if they disproportionally influenced the overall result [136–138]. The random effects models were then recalculated with the 19 studies and 32 variables.This resulted in the prevalence of mental health difficulties increasing to 0.39 (95% CI: 0.31–0.47) (Fig 5). While high heterogeneity remained (Higgin’s I2 = 98%).Visual observation of a funnel plot and trim-and-fill procedure suggests the absence of publi-cation bias. Following Orwin’s algorithm, it was shown that 31 unpublished null studies wouldbe needed to reduce the meta-analytic effect found within this sample. Again, subgroup analysesconsidering the risk of bias were conducted. The QEM model reported an estimate of 0.39 (95%CI: 0.31–0.47), suggesting that there were not enough differences regarding the risk of bias rat-ings to substantially influence the overall effects. Subgroup analysis of this sample demonstratedthat 4 studies were considered high quality, 14 were of moderate quality and 3 of low quality.However, little could be concluded from between groups differences (Q = 1.54, P = 0.46).Further subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate the impact of uncontrolled covari-ates relating to mental health difficulties prevalence (Table 4). The first of these again consid-ered the prevalence differences which may occur between LGBQ and TNGC samples. Thisanalysis evidenced that LGBQ young people were shown to have a higher prevalence of mentalhealth difficulties than TGNC individuals (42% vs 34%). The difference in effect size is likelyrelated to the large difference of included studies. The Higgins I2 value for both groups werestill high, suggesting that these studies do contribute to heterogeneity, although to lesser extentFig 4.

A similar subgroup analysis regarding outcome was conducted,this demonstrated that the rates of mental health difficulties were slightly more prevalentamong those with suicidal ideation.Following this, a meta-analysis of odds ratios was conducted; considering prevalence ofmental health difficulties among LGBTQ+ young people and cisgender, heterosexual youngpeople both with experiences of self-harm or suicide. Only 7 studies had available data. Therandom effects model calculated an odds ratio of 2.67 (95% CI: 1.93–3.71), with a high level ofheterogeneity (I2 = 95%) (Fig 6). However, due to the limited number of studies, further analy-sis was not conducted.DiscussionThis is the first meta-analysis which evidences prevalence of victimisation and mental healthdifficulties within young people aged 12–25 who identify as LGBTQ+ with experiences of self-harm, suicidal ideation and attempt. The review consisted of 142,510 participants who were asexual orientation or gender identity minority. Due to limited information reported within thestudies, it was not possible to consistently consider TGNC participants by their sexual orienta-tion as well. Evidence demonstrated high prevalence of victimisation (36%) and mental healthdifficulties (39%) within these populations. Our review shows that these experiences wererespectively 3.74 times and 2.67 times higher among young LGBTQ+ people than their cisgen-der, heterosexual counterparts. There were only 10 studies which were considered high-qual-ity, with most studies (81%) being rated as moderate quality. Substantial heterogeneity wasobserved between study estimates within both meta-analyses.The key findings of this meta-analysis strongly support previous research [9,20,22–26].Within this study, a broad view of victimisation was arrogated, including a range of bullyingbehaviours such as cyber victimisation, homophobic bullying, peer bullying and so forth. Pre-ceding meta-analyses have previously demonstrated established links between peer victimisa-tion and suicide and LGBT victimisation and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) [25,26]. Thisreview demonstrates that there is a high prevalence between LGBTQ+ young peopleexperiencing various forms of victimisation and self-harm and suicide. Indeed, this linkFig 6. Odds ratio of LGBTQ+ young people with experiences of self-harm or suicide compared to cisgender,heterosexual peers with experiences of self-harm or suicide.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268.g006PLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 14 / 26between victimisation and self-harm and/or suicide appears to be more common than thatamong cisgender, heterosexual peers.Mental health difficulties were also shown to be highly prevalent with self-harm and suicideamong LGBTQ+ young people. Liu and colleagues also evidenced mental health difficultieswere linked to NSSI within this population [25]. The current review extends findings from pre-vious research by calculating risk prevalence and odds across the spectrum of self-harm to sui-cide and differentiating by gender identity and sexuality [25,26]. Thus, demonstrating thathigher rates of victimisation and mental health difficulties are found in LGBTQ+ young peoplewho experience self-harm and suicide. However, evidence is not available from this review asthe causal pathway causing self-harm or suicide or how predictive these risks associated withself-harm and suicide are.By looking across the broad umbrella LGBTQ+ identities, this review has assessed the prev-alence of risks associated with self-harm and suicide by gender identity compared to sexualorientation minorities groups. This allows for consideration of how influential these risksmight be to particular groups among the LGBTQ+ label, and where differences of risk may lie.Both victimisation and mental health difficulties were evidenced to be more prevalent withinLGBQ young people rather than TGNC. However, it is likely that our finding is due to thehigher number of studies focusing solely on LGBQ populations, as noted by the wider confi-dence intervals seen within the TGNC subgroup analyses. Furthermore, those studies whichconsidered both sexual orientation and gender identity, tend to have low numbers of TGNCparticipants. Therefore, the TGNC risks are potentially conflated or ignored, as there is a lackof statistical power to evidence risks which may apply to TGNC participants and not LGBQ.Further to this, we were unable to conduct meta-analysis by identity (e.g. transgender man,transgender woman, nonbinary etc.) within gender identity or sexuality (e.g. bisexual, homo-sexual, lesbian), thereby these are broadly categorised. This may overlook differences betweenidentifying as a particular sexual orientation or gender identity; and, how being a member ofthese subgroups may differ from each other [145]. Additionally, no papers considered sexuali-ties outside of homosexual, bisexual, queer or questioning. This limits how far these risk con-clusions might be drawn to other sexual orientation groups e.g. those who are asexual,pansexual, polysexual etc. Future research should support inclusion of diverse sexualities andgender identities within studies, offering individuals to self-report in their own words, andoptions for intersectional identities.This review has important clinical and policy implications in relation to suicide preventionamong LGBTQ young people. Primarily, discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals haswidely been recognised as a priority for governments and organisations globally [146,147].These results definitively highlight the harmful outcomes associated with acts of discrimina-tion and victimisation. Given the variety of countries which are included in this study, thefindings of this study could be used to inform national policies, such that there is a priorityfocus on reducing minority victimisation and discrimination. Furthermore, by understandingthese complex experiences which surround LGBTQ+ youth, compounded by high rates ofmental health difficulties, suicide prevention strategies are better informed to support LGBTQ+ youth. Thereby suicide prevention interventions and policies may be better tailored to thespecific needs of LGBTQ+ young people and develop initiatives which build resilience andchallenge societal acceptance of such discrimination. However, the studies in this meta-analy-sis mainly come from High-Income Countries (HIC), therefore the results might not be gener-alisable to Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMIC) where young people who identify asLGBTQ+ may face additional or different types of risks.Secondly, health care professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of mental healthdifficulties and victimisation within the umbrella of LGBTQ+ young people. AcknowledgingPLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 15 / 26sexuality and gender identity in an accepting and supportive manner, would be beneficial toencouraging a constructive health care environment [148,149], which could potentially aid dis-closure of self-harm and suicide. Evidence also shows that health professionals encouragingLGBTQ+ youth to discuss their experiences of victimisation could further reduce negativehealth consequences [150]. From these insights, professionals might be able to suggest treat-ments or care understanding the sociodemographic environment which these individuals areliving in.Much of this research takes places within school settings, with the average age of partici-pants being below 18 years old. Given that bullying among school-aged children is common[151], this would suggest that school-based interventions would be an appropriate setting totarget victimisation for LGBTQ+ young people, potentially reducing self-harm and suicide.This is supported by a recent study suggesting that addressing the barriers and facilitatorswhen reporting and responding to LGBTQ+ victimisation in schools would prevent adversemental health [152]. In particular, LGBTQ+ youth felt that building trust with staff members,being given time to discuss problems and receiving responses from school were key [152].Therefore, creating an environment which recognises the unique aspects and potential risks ofbeing LGBTQ+, such as dealing with difficult disclosure [118] or understanding gender non-conformity [25] would be beneficial. This could translate to older adolescents and young adultsby having similar environments within colleges, universities or social community spaces.These spaces might be able to consider risks, which differentiate by age (e.g. identity develop-ment, transition treatments available, housing situations) which due to limited reporting wewere unable to meta-analysis within this review.There is a wealth of literature readily available relating to risks for self-harm and suicidewithin LGBTQ+ young people. However importantly, even though many of these studies hadexplicit focus on LGBTQ+ individuals, only 12% of the total population held these identitiesand reporting is highly inconsistence between individual risks. Future research in the field ofself-harm and suicide prevention requires a specific LGBTQ+ focus as this would allow for aholistic understanding of these populations’ experiences.Strengths & limitationsThis is the first systematic review and meta-analysis which has comprehensively synthesised exist-ing evidence from across the full spectrum of LGBTQ+ young people in order to identify the prev-alence of key risks with self-harm and suicide. Firstly, this dimensional approach allowed for aholistic view and comparison of risk prevalence across self-harm and suicidal thoughts and behav-iours. Secondly, broad search strategies were run, which ensured a large amount of studies wasidentified across disciplines and across the LGBTQ+ umbrella. This search was re-run prior tosubmission to ensure that the review was as up-to-date as possible. Thereby, TGNC populationswere able to be identified and specifically examined with reference to similar LGBQ samples. Afinal strength was the robust meta-analytic strategy which was emplaced within this study, there-fore allowing authors to determine points of bias and control for these.There were, however, some limitations which need to be considered. Firstly, there were fewhigh-quality studies and substantial heterogeneity within the findings. Sources of heterogene-ity were explored using our pre-specified subgroup analysis but also to determine points ofheterogeneity; this offered little. Potentially, this was related to the use of four variations of theNOS assessment (see SM2). While inclusion of four versions allowed for a greater number ofpapers to be assessed, this also created another variable of ambiguity. However, heterogeneitymay also be related to the variation in conceptualisation of phenomena, population, studydesign and fundamentally individual reporting of risk. In future, clear operationalisationPLOS ONE Meta-analysis: Risk prevalence, self-harm and suicide, LGBTQ+ youthPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245268 January 22, 2021 16 / 26within studies is necessary and use of standardised, validated measures to assess self-harm andsuicide across the spectrum of thoughts and behaviours.Secondly, self-harm with suicide intention and self-harm without suicide intention mayhave different associated risks which link to why someone might be more likely to considersuicide. However, given the measures used to assess self-harm within included studies this wasnot possible. Therefore, only risks associated with self-harm regardless of intention was able tobe analysed. This does not allow us to offer explanation as to why someone might consider sui-cide with this behaviour. Finally, searches were limited to English language; thereby key studieswithin other languages may have been overlooked.Supporting informationS1 Fig. Search strategy terms.(TIF)S2 Fig. PRISMA flow diagram.(TIF)S3 Fig. Forest plot of victimisation prevalence among LGBTQ+ with experiences of self-harm or suicide.(TIF)S4 Fig. Odds ratio among LGBTQ+ young people with experiences of self-harm or suicidecompared to cisgender, heterosexual young people with experiences of self-harm or sui-cide.(TIF)S5 Fig. Overall prevalence of mental health difficulties within LGBTQ+ young people withexperiences of self-harm or suicide.(TIF)S6 Fig. Odds ratio of LGBTQ+ young people with experiences of self-harm or suicide com-pared to cisgender, heterosexual peers with experiences of self-harm or suicide.(TIF)S1 Table.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: LGBTQ+ youth have higher rates of self-harm and suicide than cisgender, heterosexual peers. Less is known about prevalence of risks within these populations.OBJECTIVES: The first systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of risks among young people throughout the LGBTQ+ umbrella with experiences across the dimension of self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicide behaviour; and how they may differ between LGBTQ+ umbrella groups.DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science searches were run to identify quantitative research papers (database inception to 31st January, 2020).STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Articles included were empirical quantitative studies, which examined risks associated with self-harm, suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviour in LGBTQ+ young people (12-25 years).SYNTHESIS METHODS: 2457 articles were identified for screening which was completed by two independent reviewers. 104 studies met inclusion criteria of which 40 had data which could be meta-analysed in a meaningful way. This analysis represents victimisation and mental health difficulties as risks among LGBTQ+ youth with self-harm and suicide experiences. Random-effects modelling was used for the main analyses with planned subgroup analyses.RESULTS: Victimisation and mental health were key risk factors across the dimension self-harm and suicide identified through all analyses. A pooled prevalence of 0.36 was indicated for victimisation and 0.39 for mental health difficulties within LGBTQ+ young people with experiences of self-harm or suicide. Odds ratios were calculated which demonstrated particularly high levels of victimisation (3.74) and mental health difficulties (2.67) when compared to cisgender, heterosexual counterparts who also had these experiences.CONCLUSIONS: Victimisation and mental health difficulties are highly prevalent among LGBTQ+ youth with experiences of self-harm and suicide. Due to inconsistency of reporting, further risk synthesis is limited. Given the global inclusion of studies, these results can be considered across countries and inform policy and suicide prevention initiatives.PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019130037.</p",
