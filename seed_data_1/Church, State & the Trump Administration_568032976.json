Nevertheless, his campaign promises, as well as statements made by him and his cabinet appointees, suggest that Trump holds a limited and deeply flawed understanding of religious freedom, among other constitutional rights and guarantees. While members of the new administration will act quickly and aggressively to advance certain conservative Christian religious tenets by limiting the rights of LGBTQ communities and curtailing access to reproductive health care, the President has promised to significantly restrain the rights of religious minorities by imposing a Muslim immigration ban, increase profiling and policing of Muslim communities, and closing houses of worship. The Vice-President, Attorney General and other appointees hold particularly distorted understandings of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, threatening to capture government for religious interests and implement theocratic policies beyond anything we’ve seen in recent history.    As we prepare to meet these new and serious threats to religious liberty and other fundamental rights, this paper offers an outline of areas where the Trump administration may violate the letter and spirit of the First Amendment by expressing a state preference for certain religions or religious beliefs, limiting the rights of religious minorities, or granting religious accommodations that harm other private citizens.   Religious & Civil Rights of Muslims  While Trump and many of his cabinet appointees have spoken out on the importance of religious freedom, they have also taken deeply troubling steps to restrict the religious rights and civil liberties of religious minorities, particularly Muslims. President Trump has at times called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States,1 the profiling of Muslim Americans,2 the creation of a national Muslim registry,3 and the closing of                                                              1 CAMPAIGN WEBSITE OF DONALD J.

In fact, Trump explicitly stated that the EO would prefer Christians during an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network the day he issued the Order.9  While the USRAP is suspended, Trump’s EO nevertheless allows admittance of refugees on a case-by-case basis if the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security determine that their admission “is in the national interest— including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution.” Further, when and if the USRAP is reinstated, the Order directs the agencies to “prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.” The Order directs the agencies “where necessary and appropriate” to “recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization,” and requires the State department to submit two reports to the President “on the progress of the directive… regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of                                                                                                                                                                                      3 Trip Gabriel, Donald Trump Says He’d ‘Absolutely’ Require Muslims to Register, N.Y.TIMES, (Nov. 20, 2015) https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/20/donald-trump-says-hed-absolutely-require-muslims-to-register/;  Aaron Blake, Trump Says We’ve Known His Muslim Ban and Database Plans ‘All Along.’ But We Still Don’t — Not Really, THE WASHINGTON POST (Dec. 21, 2016) https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/17/the-evolution-of-donald-trump-and-the-muslim-database/?utm_term=.0e369f6f90b5. 4 Nick Gass,  Trump: 'Absolutely No Choice' But To Close Mosques, POLITICO (Nov. 18, 2015) http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/trump-close-mosques-216008. 5 Theodore Schleifer, Donald Trump: 'I think Islam Hates Us', CNN.COM (MAR. 10, 2016) http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/09/politics/donald-trump-islam-hates-us/. 6 Tessa Berenson, Trump Repeats False Pig’s Blood Story at California Rally, TIME.COM (Apr. 29, 2016) http://time.com/4312131/donald-trump-pigs-blood-muslim-story/. 7 Trip Gabriel, Donald Trump Says He’d ‘Absolutely’ Require Muslims to Register, N.Y.TIMES, (Nov. 20, 2015) https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/20/donald-trump-says-hed-absolutely-require-muslims-to-register/. 8 Full Executive Order Text: Trump’s Action Limiting Refugees Into the U.S., N.Y.

During a confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Senator Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for Attorney General, claimed to oppose an explicit ban on Muslims as a religious group. However his opinion on banning immigration from majority-Muslim countries was less clear and he has previously said he was open to a Muslim ban.10 Moreover, in December of 2015, Sessions was one of only four members of the Senate Judiciary committee to vote against a proposed amendment to an antiterrorism bill that would oppose placing a religious test on those entering the country.11 In a lengthy statement, Sessions argued that excluding immigrants based on religious beliefs could in some circumstances be logical and moral. He stated “[a]n argument has been made by some that we should prioritize resettling Muslim immigrants in the region and prioritizing the entry of persecuted Christians; this measure would forbid such considerations.”12 Sessions defended this vote during his confirmation hearing, arguing that “many people do have religious views that are inimical to the public safety of the United States.”13 He acknowledged, however, that a registry explicitly targeting Muslims “would raise serious constitutional problems” under the First Amendment.14  Other appointees have been similarly vague in their support for or opposition to Trump’s proposals. Michael T. Flynn, whom Trump has selected as National Security Advisor, originally supported both a Muslim ban and registry according to some news sources,15                                                              10 Eric Lichtblau, Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General, Could Overhaul Department He’s Skewered, N.Y.

Somewhat ironically, Sessions has used faith-based arguments to express his belief that the U.S. should be permitted to use religious tests in admitting immigrants. Speaking at the “Road to Majority” conference in June of 2016, he claimed that “the idea that nations don’t set laws, establish who can and can’t enter, is not biblical in my opinion.” See Right Wing Watch Blog, Jeff Sessions: My Immigration Position is the “Biblical” One, YOUTUBE (June 10, 2016), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD6Z-TEdQqA. 13 Key Capitol Hill Hearings Session Muslim Ban, YOUTUBE (January 10, 2017),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlFOJopm9_M. 14 Jonathan Easley & Lydia Wheeler, Live Coverage of Sessions Confirmation Hearing, THE HILL (Jan. 10, 2017) https://origin-nyi.thehill.com/homenews/senate/313469-live-coverage-of-sessions-confirmation-hearing. 15 Matt Apuzzo & Mark Landler, With National Security Choices, Trump Builds Team to Bulldoze Status Quo, N.Y.

Senator Sessions has called Islam a “toxic ideology.”21 Flynn, among many incendiary statements, has called Islam a “cancer” and tweeted that fear of Muslims is “rational.”22 In the wake of the Boston marathon bombing in 2013, Representative Mike Pompeo, who has been confirmed as Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director, called Muslim leaders                                                                                                                                                                                      National Security Adviser Mike Flynn Has Called Islam 'a Cancer', ABC NEWS (Nov. 18, 2016) http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-mike-flynn-called/story?id=43575658 (“Flynn has said he agreed with Trump's initial proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States”). 16 Top US General Defends Donald Trump, AL JAZEERA UP FRONT (May 19, 2016), http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2016/05/top-general-defends-donald-trump-160519081014660.html. 17 Patrick Temple-West, Priebus: Citizens of Certain Countries Will Be Barred, POLITICO (NOV. 20, 2016) http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/priebus-certain-foreigners-will-be-barred-from-us-231681. 18 Christina Coleburn, Reince Priebus on Muslim Registry: ‘Not Going to Rule Out Anything’, NBC NEWS (Nov. 20, 2016) http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/priebus-muslim-registry-not-going-rule-out-anything-n686391. 19 Gen.

I’ve had each of those bestowed upon me. I’ve been called a tool of the Jews. But it will never dissuade me and I hope none of you from… proclaiming this is an exceptional nation and that Jesus Christ is my savior.”25 Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Ben Carson, has made numerous Islamaphobic statements, including claiming that Islam is not a religion but a “life organization system”26 and comparing Syrian refugees to “a rabid dog running around your neighborhood.”27 Comments by cabinet appointees that refer to Islam as a political ideology or otherwise not a religion are troubling, as they suggest that Islam should not receive First Amendment protections.   Muslim communities have faced numerous impositions on their civil rights under the Bush and Obama presidencies, including the maintenance of the widely-criticized no-fly list28 and discriminatory surveillance of Muslim Americans.29 At the same time, the Department of Justice (DOJ), Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and other federal agencies have brought numerous suits to defend Muslims from discrimination, including a recently-filed DOJ suit against a New Jersey town that denied zoning approval for a mosque.30 This year, the U.S. Army agreed to make                                                              23  United Voices for America, Congressman Mike Pompeo Anti-Muslim Bigotry from House Floor, YOUTUBE (July 25, 2013), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaEXDqtCV5w. 24 Letter from Council on American-Islamic Relations, to Mike Pompeo, House Representative from Kansas (June 12, 2013), available at http://www.cair.com/images/letters/Pompeo-letter.pdf. 25 Summit Church, Summit Church God and Country Rally 2015, YOUTUBE (Jul 8, 2015) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO0opXYM52w. 26 Patrick Caldwell, Ben Carson Says Islam Is Not a Religion But a \"Life Organization System”, MOTHER JONES (Jan. 29, 2016) http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/ben-carson-islam-not-religion; Eric Bradner, Ben Carson again explains concerns with a Muslim president, CNN.COM (Sept. 27, 2015) http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/27/politics/ben-carson-muslim-president-sharia-law/; Nick Gass, Carson: Muslims Who Embrace American Values Have to Be 'Schizophrenic', POLITICO (FEB. 16, 2016) http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/ben-carson-muslims-schizophrenic-219319. 27 Nolan D.

Nearly all of Trump’s anti-Muslim proposals would raise significant First Amendment and other constitutional questions. The First Amendment forbids the government both from expressing a preference for any religious denomination or sect and from weighing in on exclusively theological questions.33 Further, houses of worship are entitled to extremely strong Constitutional protections against government interference.34 Any act to single out Muslims for discriminatory treatment, attempt to legally define a “Muslim” for immigration purposes, or place special restrictions on Mosques and other Islamic institutions threatens both Free Exercise and Establishment Clause violations by restricting Muslims’ right to practice their religion and expressing official skepticism or disapproval of Islam. Such acts are also likely to raise challenges under the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.   While Trump’s recent Executive Order banning many Muslim immigrants leaves open the confounding question of what constitutes a religious “minority”, it is clear from both the face of the Order and the context around its creation that Trump’s actions are intended to discriminate based on religious belief. President Trump has pledged to instate a Muslim ban throughout his campaign, and he has now taken a significant step to fulfill this promise. At its core, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment forbids the                                                                                                                                                                                      threatening-letter-islamic-center; U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION, Selected List of Pending and Resolved Cases Alleging Religious and National Origin Discrimination Involving the Muslim, Sikh, Arab, Middle Eastern and South Asian Communities (last updated Jan. 2016) https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/litigation/selected/religion_nationalorigin.cfm.  31 Emma Green, Coming Soon to the U.S. Army: Turbans, Beards, Hijabs, and Dreadlocks, THE ATLANTIC (Jan. 4, 2017) https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/coming-soon-to-the-us-army-turbans-beards-hijabs-and-cornrows/512204/. 32 Kevin Liptak & Shachar Peled, Obama Administration Ending Program Once Used to Track Mostly Arab and Muslim Men, CNN.COM (Dec. 22, 2016) http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/22/politics/obama-nseers-arab-muslim-registry/.  33 See, e.g., Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v.

This Order violates that crucial limitation.  Reproductive Justice & Sexual Liberty  In the name of religious liberty, Trump’s cabinet threatens to advance particular religious viewpoints about sexual and reproductive morality. Several appointees have claimed that ensuring access to reproductive healthcare, including contraception, infringes on religious freedom. This is mistaken; to the contrary, allowing religious groups to impose their beliefs on others by denying them access to affordable health care limits religious pluralism and may amount to a constitutional violation. Trump himself has an ambiguous record on abortion, although he currently claims to oppose legal abortion and has promised to appoint anti-choice justices to the Supreme Court and restrict abortion rights through legislation.35 One of his first actions upon assuming office was to reinstate a greatly-expanded version of the global gag rule, which forbids international organizations from performing or providing information about abortion if they receive U.S. health funding.36 He also supports religious exemptions that would allow certain actors to use their personal religious beliefs to limit access to reproductive health care, or to discriminate against those who have had sex outside the confines of a different-sex marriage.37 In addition, many of Trump’s cabinet appointees have a long and extreme history of anti-choice views, and have expressed support for broad religious accommodations related to sexual and reproductive health and choices.  While Trump previously identified as pro-choice, he called himself “pro-life” on the campaign trail, at one point even suggesting that if abortion were made illegal, women who get abortions should be punished (he later rescinded the statement).38 In an interview on a Christian radio show, Vice President Mike Pence was asked whether Trump would eliminate the provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that requires health plans to cover contraception without cost sharing or, “at the least,” provide an exemption for religious non-profits and certain for-profit companies. He replied, “a Trump/Pence administration will be dedicated to preserving the liberties of our people including freedom of religion,” stated that “we have a long tradition in this country of                                                              35 Letter from Donald J.

It could also prevent the government from refusing to award grants—such as funding for HIV/AIDS services or care for survivors of domestic violence—to organizations that will not serve anyone who has had sex outside marriage.    Representative Tom Price, Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), is a strong opponent of reproductive rights and has supported broad religious exemptions related to sexual health and freedom. In a 2013 op-ed, he called the ACA a “constitutional violation” and “an unabashed assault on our First Amendment rights” because of the contraceptive coverage provision.41 Three years earlier, when asked by a reporter about contraceptive coverage under the ACA, Price stated “this is a trampling on religious freedom and religious liberty in this country. The President does not have the power to say that your First Amendment rights go away. That’s wrong.”42 He has made many similar statements in the past.43   Price additionally signed a brief to the Supreme Court in support of religious nonprofits challenging the existing religious accommodation of the ACA’s contraceptive coverage                                                              39 A Visit with Governor Mike and Karen Pence, DR.

Burwell.44 The accommodation allows religious nonprofits opposed to paying for cost-free contraceptive coverage for their employees to sign an opt-out form and send it to their insurance company or the government. The insurance company then has an independent obligation to provide contraceptive coverage to the employees. The brief signed by Price argues that even signing the opt-out form infringes on the nonprofits religious rights; in adopting the accommodation, the brief claims that HHS exhibited “hostility to religious non-profits.”45 In May 2016, the Court remanded the case without issuing a substantive decision, suggesting that the two sides attempt to find a solution that would be acceptable to the nonprofits while ensuring comprehensive coverage for employees.46 Following this decision, HHS—along with the Department of Labor and the Treasury—went through a notice and comment period to evaluate alternatives to the existing accommodation; in December of 2016, the departments decided not to alter the accommodation, finding that “the comments reviewed… indicate that no feasible approach has been identified at this time that would resolve the concerns of religious objectors, while still ensuring that the affected women receive full and equal health coverage.”47  While Trump’s administration has expressed support for broad religious exemptions to the ACA that would cut off access to contraception for many workers, they have also advocated eliminating the ACA entirely. Both Trump and Price have relentlessly attacked the health law and promised to repeal it.48 Trump’s first action as President after being sworn in was to issue an executive order stating, “It is the policy of my Administration to seek the prompt repeal of” the ACA, and instructing agencies to “take all actions consistent with law to minimize the unwarranted economic and regulatory burdens of the Act.”49 While the details of any ACA replacement plan are far from clear, Trump and his cabinet would be unlikely to support any mandatory, affordable contraceptive coverage provision, even with a broad religious exemption. When asked at his confirmation hearing whether he would commit to ensuring cost-free coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptive methods, Price would commit only to ensuring “access” to the health                                                              44 Brief for 207 Members of Congress as Amici Curiae Supporting Petitioners, Zubik v.

As a Senator, Price proposed an ACA alternative called the “Empowering Patients First Act of 2015.” His bill includes a provision that prohibits the federal government, as well as any state and locality that receives money under the Act, from subjecting any health care provider to “discrimination” because “the health care entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.” There is no similar provision protecting health entities that do provide abortions from “discrimination.” Price also voted in 2015 to overturn a Washington, D.C. law that prohibited employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of their reproductive health decisions.51 During his hearing, Price claimed that he did not believe an employer should be able to fire someone for using birth control and claimed, incorrectly, that the D.C. bill was about the cost of contraception.52 Price is also co-sponsor of FADA, the bill that would sanction discrimination against those who have had sex outside of a different-sex marriage.53  While Price stands to have the greatest impact on reproductive justice policy, other members of Trump’s team have expressed support for broad religious exemptions related to sexual and reproductive health and rights. Reince Priebus has called the contraceptive coverage requirement an “assault on religious freedom.”54 Senator Sessions is a co-sponsor of FADA,55 and has defended the bill since his nomination.56 The Zubik amicus brief discussed above was signed by Representative Pompeo, Trump’s selection to lead the CIA, who is also a FADA co-sponsor.57 Scott Pruitt, Trump’s prick to lead the                                                              50 Health and Human Services Secretary Confirmation Hearing, C-SPAN (Jan. 18, 2017) https://www.c-span.org/video/?421723-1/hhs-nominee-representative-tom-price-testifies-capitol-hill&start=1201. 51 161 Cong.

In addition to the contraceptive mandate, the administration also promulgated a rule to protect people who have had abortions from discrimination in healthcare—a rule that was recently struck down by a federal district court judge in Texas as a violation of healthcare provider’s religious rights (Trump’s administration may decline to appeal the decision).59 Under Price and Trump, HHS is likely to undo many or all of the Obama administration’s policies with regard to reproductive rights and health. At a minimum, they will attempt to expand the right of religious organizations, including for-profit companies, to deny employees access to contraception and discriminate against those who have had sex while unmarried. The administration may well take more drastic action by eliminating the contraceptive mandate altogether, and Trump has promised to sign a repeal of the entire ACA.60   Price and others’ claim that the contraceptive mandate violates the First Amendment is entirely unfounded. In Employment Division v. Smith, the Supreme Court, through Justice Scalia, clearly held that “the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a ‘valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).’”61 The contraceptive mandate is a valid, neutral law that is intended to provide workers with necessary healthcare, not to discriminate against any particular religious belief. In fact, the overly-broad religious exemptions that Trump and his cabinet support themselves raise significant First Amendment issues. The Supreme Court has consistently held that religious accommodations amount to an Establishment Clause violation when they tend to prefer or endorse particular religious beliefs,62 or when they                                                              58 Brief for the States of Texas, Ohio, Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin as Amici Curiae Supporting Petitioners, Zubik v.

Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 687 (1984) (“Endorsement sends a message to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community”) (O’Connor, J., concurring); Santa Fe Independent School District v.

While the Supreme Court granted a religious exemption to the ACA’s contraceptive mandate in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, it specifically noted that the accommodation would not impede employees’ access to contraception.64 Further, the exemption was granted under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a broad accommodation law that applies to all religious beliefs, not just particular narrow beliefs related to sexual health and reproductive rights. To the extent that broad accommodations proposed by the Trump administration would provide special protections for certain religious beliefs about sexual morality or limit access to contraceptive coverage, they threaten Establishment Clause protections. Unfortunately, if the contraceptive mandate or the ACA is eliminated entirely rather than weakened through a broad religious exemption, it will be far more difficult to make an argument based on the Establishment Clause.   LGBTQ Discrimination  While Trump himself has claimed that he will be a “friend” to “the gays”65 as President, he and many of his cabinet appointees support policies and beliefs that are hostile to LGBTQ equality and justice. For example, both Trump and his cabinet nominees have stated clearly that they intend to revoke LGBTQ protections established under the Obama administration through executive orders and federal agency regulations, and it has been reported that Trump will issue an Executive Order to do so shortly.66 Despite claiming that transgender people deserve “help,” Trump has said that he intends to rescind federal protections currently in place that protect transgender people in healthcare and at                                                                                                                                                                                      perceived as favoring one religion over another is an important risk the Establishment Clause was designed to preclude.”). 63 See, e.g., Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703, 709 (1985) (holding that a Connecticut statute giving workers the right to a Sabbath day of rest impermissibly advanced religion by “impos[ing] on employers and employees an absolute duty to conform their business practices to the particular religious practices of the [observing] employee”); Texas Monthly, Inc. v.

While in the Senate, Sessions voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and called the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which found that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right to marry for same-sex couples, “unconstitutional.”71 In his recent confirmation hearing, Sessions conceded that the decision is settled law. However, when it was decided in 2015, he said it went “beyond what [he] considers to be the realm of reality.”72 Sessions also once sought to defund the National Endowment of the Arts, citing the Endowment’s funding of a lesbian film which he claimed was “obscene” and “pornographic,” largely because of its inclusion of “homosexual activities.”73 He has also publicly opposed the inclusion of LGBTQ people in federal hate crimes legislation and the Violence Against Women Act, and voted against both bills while in the Senate. He has opposed reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which included an antidiscrimination clause, because it “could have discriminated against faith-based organizations.”74                                                               67 Philip Rucker & Robert Costa, Trump: Rescind Obama’s Transgender Directives, But ‘Protect Everybody’, THE WASHINGTON POST (May 16, 2016) https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/trump-rescind-obamas-transgender-directives-but-protect-everybody/?postshare=4331463435010310&tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.7ce4a35cd8ef. 68 CAMPAIGN WEBSITE OF DONALD J.

Under Attorney General Loretta Lynch, for example, the DOJ brought a lawsuit against the state of North Carolina following the state’s passage of House Bill 2.75 Among other things, this law eliminates local antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people and requires transgender people in government buildings to use the restroom of the gender they were assigned at birth.76  The DOJ also joined other federal agencies in issuing guidance on the applicability of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 196477 and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to transgender people.78 The DOJ has consistently defended the inclusion of protections based on sex stereotyping and gender identity under the ACA, and joined the Department of Education (DOE) in issuing guidance to schools to ensure that transgender students are protected from discrimination under Title IX.  Throughout his campaign for President, Ben Carson—who would be charged with enforcing the Fair Housing Act as HUD secretary— argued that he would ground his role as a government official in his own religious principles, which he contends are in direct conflict with preventing discrimination against LGBTQ people (among other groups).79 For example, despite the Supreme Court’s holding in Obergefell, Carson has stated emphatically that he does not support same-sex marriage, calling it an “extra right” and the LGBTQ people seeking it, “abnormal.”80 During his run for president, he strongly supported Kim Davis, the infamous Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, arguing that it conflicted with her religious beliefs and that LGBTQ people should not be able to force their “way of life upon everybody else.”81 Carson’s support for Davis indicates how he might approach conflicts between religious liberty and civil rights as Secretary. He has also stated that Congress should fire federal judges who support marriage equality and pass a law to nullify the Supreme Court’s                                                              75 David A.

His statements indicate a belief that transgender people should not be recognized as their authentic selves under the law. LGBTQ people have gained significant housing protections under the Obama administration. In 2012, HUD released urgently needed regulations to ensure LGBTQ people have equal access to housing and housing-related services,86 and in 2016, it extended those protections to emergency homeless shelters that were not previously covered.87 Carson’s nomination signals a threat to these protections.   Despite not having a voting record in Congress or a state legislature, nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, has made significant contributions towards undermining LGBTQ equality. For example, in 2012 DeVos and her husband personally donated $200,000 to Michigan’s ballot measure to ban same-sex marriage88 and her family members have collectively donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to other anti-LGBTQ efforts, including to support Proposition 8 in California.89  Tom Price’s nomination to become Secretary of HHS calls into question the permanency of vital LGBTQ protections in healthcare promulgated under the Obama administration. In Congress, Price’s voting record has indicated hostility to LGBTQ rights, grounded in his personal religious beliefs.

At the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump mentioned LGBTQ people only when he recalled the Pulse nightclub shooting, stating “wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist,” and promising “As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.”95 During a speech on immigration, Trump explained that the U.S. should instate an “ideological certification” process on immigrants, asking “about respect for women and gays and minorities.”96  In defending the prospect of screening immigrants based on religious belief, Senator Sessions—a lifelong opponent of LGBTQ rights—claimed, “It is appropriate to be aggressive in our vetting.  Questions can be asked: do you believe in religious freedom, do you believe in sharia law or the Constitution, and do you respect minorities such as women and gays.”97 An anti-Muslim Executive Action currently under consideration by President Trump states that the U.S. should not admit immigrants “who would oppress members of one                                                              90 Price Statement on \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" Repeal, VOTESMART.ORG (last visited Jan. 23, 2017) https://votesmart.org/public-statement/576891/price-statement-on-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal#.WIEJkrYrLGI. 91 HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN, Congressional Scorecard: Measuring Support for Equality in the 110th Congress (last visited Jan. 26, 2017) http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/documents/Congress_Scorecard-110th.pdf; Maggie Garrett, Is Discrimination The Price We’ll Pay For Trump’s HHS Secretary?, AMERICAN UNITED FOR SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE (Nov. 29, 2016) https://www.au.org/blogs/wall-of-separation/is-discrimination-the-price-we-ll-pay-for-trump-s-hhs-secretary. 92 H.J.R.

As in the reproductive rights context, the First Amendment does not sanction laws or regulations that endorse particular religious viewpoints, nor may the state offer religious exemptions that harm private third parties. The Supreme Court has twice held that religious beliefs do not provide an exemption from antidiscrimination laws.99 Should Trump or his appointees institute LGBTQ-related policies that have a primarily religious purpose or effect, or grant religious accommodations that harm LGBTQ people, they risk violating the Establishment Clause.  Education  Trump’s administration is likely to support diverting government funds to private religious schools through the adoption of voucher programs, as well as weakening church-state protections in public schools. Initially, Trump sought to appoint Jerry Falwell, Jr., president of the conservative Evangelical institution Liberty University, as Secretary of the Department of Education (DOE). Falwell—whose University teaches creationism100 and who has been criticized for anti-Muslim remarks101—declined the offer. Trump’s current nominee, Betsy DeVos, is a longstanding advocate for school voucher programs, which give taxpayer funds to students to pay for tuition at private and religious schools.102 While such measures are controversial in education circles, they can also pose First Amendment questions.   The chief aim of some—though not all—voucher proponents is to divert funds from secular public schools to religious, primarily Christian schools. There is some evidence that DeVos sees vouchers as a means of advancing her religious faith. At a 2001 Christian summit called “The Gathering,” DeVos and her husband spoke extensively                                                              98 THE WASHINGTON POST, Read the Draft of the Executive Order on Immigration and Refugees (Jan. 25, 2017) http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/read-the-draft-of-the-executive-order-on-immigration-and-refugees/2289/. 99 Bob Jones University v.

At The Gathering, in response to a question regarding a return to church-dominated education in the U.S., DeVos stated “I think for many years the church in general has felt that it’s important for the children of the congregation to be in the schools to make a difference but in fact I think what’s happened in many cases in the last couple of decades is that the [public] schools have impacted the kids more than the kids are able to impact the schools. Young children need to have a pretty solid foundation to be able to combat the kind of influences that they’re presented with almost on a daily basis.”108   DeVos also has extensive ties to organizations that oppose the separation of church and state.109 For example, DeVos served for ten years on the board of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty,110 a conservative think tank that supports Christian influence in government, including in education. The Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation has contributed over a million dollars to the  Institute, whose website contains numerous articles arguing that a commitment to secular public education is in fact                                                              103 Betsy and Dick DeVos Talk About Reforming Education at a Gathering of Wealthy Christians in 2001, POLITICO (Dec. 2, 2016) http://www.politico.com/video/2016/12/betsy-and-dick-devos-talk-about-reforming-education-at-a-gathering-of-wealthy-christians-in-2001-061697; Benjamin Wermund, Trump's education pick says reform can 'advance God's Kingdom', POLITICO (Dec. 2, 2016) http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/betsy-devos-education-trump-religion-232150.   104 Betsy and Dick DeVos Talk About Reforming Education at a Gathering of Wealthy Christians in 2001, supra note 103. 105 Id. 106 Id. 107 Kristina Rizga, Betsy DeVos Wants to Use America’s Schools to Build “God’s Kingdom”, MOTHER JONES (Jan. 17, 2017) http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/01/betsy-devos-christian-schools-vouchers-charter-education-secretary. 108 Betsy and Dick DeVos Talk About Reforming Education at a Gathering of Wealthy Christians in 2001, supra note 103. 109 Rizga, supra note 107. 110 Id.  19  discriminatory and anti-Christian.111 The Foundation also supports numerous conservative organizations that are anti-LGBTQ, anti-choice, and pro-religion in government.112 In addition to her philanthropic activities, DeVos has investments in K12, Inc., a for-profit online school that offers both public and private school options. DeVos’s husband has stated that while K12’s curriculum is “designed for a full public school environment,” it is “reflective” and “very clearly consistent with…our shared Christian worldview.”113 In an interview, K12’s founder stated that the program is “centered in the Judeo-Christian tradition, we do not ignore faith and religion, we do not ignore the arguments against evolution, because there are some.”114  Since her nomination, Betsy DeVos has not spoken extensively about her beliefs regarding church-state conflicts in schools, including whether she supports comprehensive sex education, whether she will implement LGBTQ antidiscrimination policies, how she believes evolution should be taught, or the role of religion in public schools generally.  Her answers to questions during her Senate nomination hearing were vague. For example, when asked about whether she would permit school districts to adopt curriculums that include “junk science” on climate change and creationism, DeVos answered only that she supports the teaching of “great science” that “allows students to exercise critical thinking.”115 Twice, DeVos was asked about her and her family’s donations to anti-LGBTQ religious and political groups, and Senator Tammy Baldwin asked DeVos what she would say to youth and families to assure them that she would                                                              111 Tony Olek, Controversial Christianity: Understanding Faith and Politics, THE ACTON INSTITUTE (Aug. 3, 2011) http://acton.org/pub/commentary/2011/08/03/controversial-christianity-understanding-faith-and-politics  (“A church that acts as or controls the state is not in accordance with Christ’s message, but a church that informs the state is.

Further, DeVos suggested that donations to anti-LGBTQ organizations may have been made “18 or 20 years ago.”116  Other members of Trump’s cabinet also support expanding government funding of faith based schools and allowing religion in public schools. As Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence adopted a voucher program that greatly increased funding of religious schools in that state.117 As a Representative, Pence voted in favor of resolutions permitting school prayer during the “War on Terror,”118 co-sponsored a resolution in support of “God Bless America” displays in public schools,119 and spoke in favor of teaching creationism in public schools.120 Jeff Sessions repeatedly voted in favor of voucher programs while in the Senate.121 Both Pence and Tom Price voted to remove the authority of the Supreme Court to decide whether the phrase “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance violated the First Amendment.122 At a rally in 2015, Mike Pompeo decried government efforts to “rip faith from our schools and diminish the education that comes as a result of God not being in that classroom.”123  First Amendment issues in education are complex, and whether a particular program or curriculum violates the Establishment Clause varies greatly depending on the circumstances.

Further, the Court has been far less willing to tolerate religion in public schools. The Court has held that it is unconstitutional for the government to single out particular subjects—such as evolution—for special treatment because they conflict with certain religious beliefs,125 for legislatures or public schools to encourage prayer,126 for public school convocation ceremonies to include clergy-led prayer,127 and for public school classrooms to display the ten commandments,128 and it has upheld the ability of a public University to impose a nondiscrimination policy on religious clubs.129 Should the DOE under DeVos take steps to encourage religious education—either in public or private schools—she may overstep the bounds of the Establishment Clause.   Repeal of the Johnson Amendment  During his campaign and since his election, Trump has vowed to end a policy that leaders of the religious right have adamantly opposed for years—the Johnson Amendment. This amendment to the tax code was passed by Congress in 1954 and prohibits 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, non-profit organizations, including houses of worship, from intervening in partisan politics by endorsing or opposing candidates for public office. In his nomination speech at the Republican National Convention, which adopted a repeal of the amendment into its official platform, Trump called the law a “threat” to religious institutions, and committed to having it repealed in order to “protect free speech for all Americans.”130   Trump has stated that he views the amendment’s repeal as important to both his political and religious legacy. In a speech to a group of Christian conservatives, Trump said “I think maybe that will be my greatest contribution to Christianity—and other religions—is to allow you, when you talk religious liberty, to go and speak openly, and if you like somebody or want somebody to represent you, you should have the right to do it.”131                                                              124 Zelman v.

Although a bill to repeal the Amendment has been introduced and defeated several times by Congress, Republican Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina recently re-introduced a bill to repeal the Johnson Amendment. The bill is currently in committee and has not yet received a vote from the House.132 If it does pass both chambers of Congress, however, it seems clear that Trump will sign it into law, and houses of worship will be free to act like Political Action Committees while maintaining their preferred tax status.   Religious Government Expression  President Trump and his cabinet appointees appear to be supportive of government religious expression and have endorsed the far right’s belief that separation of church and state constitutes mistreatment of Christians. Certain conservative groups have for years argued that the State should be permitted to adopt and endorse majoritarian religious beliefs, values, and symbols, and that rigorous enforcement of the Establishment Clause to protect all believers from state approval or disapproval is unnecessary and offensive to Christians.133 This argument has gotten the most public attention and support in the form of the alleged “War on Christmas”—the belief that government and private entities’ efforts to recognize religious plurality during the holiday season amount to an attack on Christmas and Christians. President Trump has encouraged this mythology. At a rally in October 2015, Trump promised “If I become president, we're going be saying Merry Christmas at every store... You can leave happy holidays at the corner.”134 After his election, Trump told his supporters, “When I started 18 months ago, I told my first crowd                                                                                                                                                                                      https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/06/20/how-can-trump-win-the-many-undecided-evangelicals-we-asked-them/?utm_term=.2e12bbcea1e7. 132 H.R. 172, 115th Cong.

In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, he claimed “the Christians are being treated horribly because we have nobody to represent the Christians. Believe me, if I run and I win, I will be the greatest representative of the Christians they've had in a long time.”136 In a speech to a gathering of pastors in Florida, Trump remarked, “if you look at what’s happening to Christianity, and you look at the number of people going to churches… it’s on this kind of a climb of slow and steady in the wrong direction.”137 At several rallies while on the campaign trail, Trump has told supporters “we will be one people under one God—one people, under one God, under one God.”138 At the Values Voter Summit in September 2015, he posited, “imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God.”139 The idea that Americans should worship “one God” is deeply antithetical to the core meaning of religious liberty.    Other Trump appointees have also been supportive of religious government expression. As a Representative, Vice President Pence co-sponsored a resolution expressing support for designating a “Ten Commandments Weekend,” and “encourag[ing] citizens of all faiths and religious persuasions to reflect on the important impact that the Ten Commandments have had on the people and national character of the U.S.,”140 one of his many  problematic positions on church-state issues.141 While running for president, Ben Carson condemned the idea of separation of church and state,142 and he has written that “secular progressives have succeeded de facto in redefining part of the Constitution.”143                                                              135 Liam Stack, How the ‘War on Christmas’ Controversy Was Created, N.Y.

In his confirmation hearing, Senator Sessions expounded that “religious freedom is a great heritage of America. We respect people’s religion. We encourage them to express themselves and to develop relationships with the higher power as they choose.”145 However, in 2006, Sessions introduced legislation to attempt to maintain a 29-foot cross on government property in California.146 While speaking in favor of a resolution supporting public displays of the Ten Commandments, Sessions stated “The Founders devised a Constitution that depended on religion serving as a civilizing force in societal life. John Adams, our second President, and one of the intellectual forces behind the formation of our Nation, said that ‘our Constitution was designed for a moral and religious people only.’”147 Sessions has argued that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment has been read too broadly, even going so far as to say during a Senate speech in 2016 that states may establish an official religion.148   The Supreme Court has upheld certain narrow government expressions that it has deemed primarily secular rather than religious, or which provide a non-discriminatory platform for diverse religious expressions.149 However it has not hesitated to strike down expressions that clearly serve to show a preference for a particular religious faith.150 While Trump and his appointees may, of course, express their own personal religious affiliation, should they seek to communicate an official endorsement of Christianity, or the belief that Americans should worship “one God,” they will be in violation of Establishment Clause.  Supreme Court  President Trump obviously stands to have an enormous impact on the makeup of the Supreme Court, an issue that will affect every topic discussed above.

ACLU of Kentucky, 545 U.S. 844 (2005); County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573 (1989).  25  additional members of the Court are above the age of 75. The past eight years has already seen a weakening of Establishment Clause norms in some cases, including Town of Greece v. Galloway151 and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby.152 At the same time, the Court has read the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Free Exercise Clause to provide a more expansive right to religious accommodations in cases including Hobby Lobby and Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.153 This trend of minimizing Establishment Clause protections while expanding a right to individual religious accommodations could accelerate greatly with the appointment of new, deeply conservative justices. Most immediately, the Court will be deciding Trinity Lutheran v. Pauley this term—a case that will determine whether it is constitutionally permissible for the government to withhold funding from religious institutions.154 It is also possible, if not likely, that the Court will hear a case in the near future on whether there is a right for religious individuals or institutions to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. With a more conservative bench, the balance may easily tilt towards a breakdown in church-state separation and a prioritization of religious exemptions over equality rights.                                                               151 Town of Greece v.

    "abstract": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly pledged to be a staunch defender of religious liberties. Nevertheless, his campaign promises, as well as statements made by him and his cabinet appointees, suggest that Trump holds a limited and deeply flawed understanding of religious freedom, among other constitutional rights and guarantees. While members of the new administration will act quickly and aggressively to advance certain conservative Christian religious tenets by limiting the rights of LGBTQ communities and curtailing access to reproductive health care, the President has promised to significantly restrain the rights of religious minorities by imposing a Muslim immigration ban, increase profiling and policing of Muslim communities, and closing houses of worship. The Vice-President, Attorney General and other appointees hold particularly distorted understandings of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, threatening to capture government for religious interests and implement theocratic policies beyond anything we’ve seen in recent history.\nAs we prepare to meet these new and serious threats to religious liberty and other fundamental rights, this paper offers an outline of areas where the Trump administration may violate the letter and spirit of the First Amendment by expressing a state preference for certain religions or religious beliefs, limiting the rights of religious minorities, or granting religious accommodations that harm other private citizens",
