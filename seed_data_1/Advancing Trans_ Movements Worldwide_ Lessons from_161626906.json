Some trans* people identify and present themselves as either a man or a woman; others identify with a non-binary gender category. trans* people describe themselves by many different terms, some of which are specific to local cultures, including transgender, transsexual, fa’afafine, travesti, hijra, genderqueer and transpinoy—to name just a few. Many global activists have started to use the abbreviation “trans*,” with an asterisk, denoting a placeholder for the entire range of possible gender identities that fall under the broad definition of trans*.** intersex: people who were born with chromosomes, gonads and/or genitals that vary from female and male standards. a former medical term, intersex has been reclaimed by intersex people as a personal and political identity. in certain local contexts, intersex people have also reclaimed the older term ‘hermaphrodite’ (or, more recently, ‘herm’) and the abbreviation ‘inter*’.welCoMeon June 3, 2012 history was made as argentina’s groundbreaking gender identity law took effect, making argentina the first country in the world to recognize the right of people to legally change their name and gender based on their own self-determination, rather than on the decisions of health professionals, judges or civil servants. three months later, as part of the international campaign to Stop trans pathologization, trans* activists and allies took part in more than 100 actions in 50 cities worldwide, calling for the end of the pathologization of trans* identities and gender diversity. in June this year, for the first time ever, intersex people were fully recognized under national anti-discrimination law with the passage of new legislation in australia. For decades, trans* individuals have been advocating against oppression based on gender identity, expression and bodily diversity in legal, political, health and social spheres. However, in recent years trans* communities and movements have emerged in almost every country of the world. indeed, when global action for trans* equality (gate) and american Jewish World Service (aJWS) recently undertook a survey of trans* and intersex** groups, they received more than 340 responses from across all regions.  almost 1 in 3 of these groups had been formed in the past three years, and the majority since 2005.Yet, most of this community development and rights activism is occurring without adequate support. according to a report by the Foundation center, in 2010, funding on trans* and intersex issues accounted for only .014% (US$1.7million) of the total funding on human rights (US$1.2 billion). Where funding for trans* issues does exist, it is often connected to sexual orientation, sexual identity or Hiv programming. While there are strategic, political reasons for these associations, there are unique issues facing trans* communities which warrant specific attention and support from funders. grants to intersex organizations continue to lag behind even the support for trans* movements. this meeting will include, but does not focus on intersex issues. We recognize the need for more funder attention to be paid to the intersex movement as well. We hope that conversations going on in the intersex movement and at this meeting will provide sparks for continued and coordinated support for the intersex activism.  Advancing Trans* Movements Worldwide is a unique opportunity to explore the challenges and opportunities facing both donors interested in funding on gender diversity and activists working to advance the rights of their community.  it is the start of an ongoing conversation that we hope will foster collaboration and partnerships to advance the rights of trans* communities throughout the world.

While current support is worrisomely low, there are growing numbers of donors committed to these issues and a stated intention from existing donors to increase funding.  this increase in donor interest is a reflection of growing evidence of human rights abuses suffered by these communities, but also a response to the growing vibrancy of the trans* and intersex movements and activism. the growing number of networks and organizations that are trans* and intersex—led has brought energy and visibility to issues previously obfuscated under the broad umbrella of “lgbti” organizing. a recent survey by american Jewish World Service and global action for trans* equality found that the majority of more than 300 trans* or intersex—led groups were founded after 2005 and almost 1 in 3 were founded since 2010.1 political gains such as progressive national legislation in argentina on changing gender in official state documents, or the inclusion of intersex as a protected ground under federal anti-discrimination legislation in australia highlight the impact of this activism. the donor world increasingly focuses on funding strategies that are aligned with and supporting communities’ own responses. this is coupled with a recognition that better collaboration between donors and activists is required to maximize the impact of resources. this briefing aims to provide information about the current state of funding on trans* and intersex issues, and identify critical issues for discussion between donors and activists at Advancing Trans* Movements Worldwide: a Meeting for Funders & activists Working on gender Diversity. the ultimate aim is to increase the funding levels to have a measurable impact on overcoming human rights abuses, social exclusion and other issues faced by these communities, and to improve the way organizations and leaders are supported. 16          aDvancing tranS* MoveMentS WorlDWiDe1  eisfeld, J, gunther, S and Shlasko, D.

Donors who only fund domestically would not have been included.  international organizations and other sources of private funding (public-private partnerships, individual donations, etc.) were not included. there were 23 total respondents out of the 38 invitations (60%), 16 public or private foundations, 6 bilateral donors (2 of which are different departments within the same government). two respondents do not currently fund on trans* or intersex, and one of these two has the intention to start funding on trans* issues in 2014. the survey asked a series of up to 65 questions to ascertain the level and type of funding on transgender issues, and separately on intersex issues. not all respondents answered all questions, and the analysis may reflect totals of respondents depending on the question. the data has limitations. given that the distribution was by invitation only, there is a bias as to the types of funding organizations that were included: those that are known by the survey sponsors predominantly work in the field of human rights and sexual rights. it was extremely difficult for many foundations and agencies to report total amounts of funding on trans* and intersex because systems are not currently established to track grants by these population groups or the data is subsumed in general reporting on lgbti or other issues. in some cases, particularly for bilaterals, because the funding is spread over so many programs and initiatives, the tracking is even more a Meeting For FUnDerS & activiStS Working on genDer DiverSitY          17funding levels on trans* issues are extremely  low compared to the  needs of the movement, but more than 50% of respondents started funding on trans*issues since 2008 and 75% of respondents currently giving on trans* issues reported that they  intend to increase  giving in 2014. challenging. the total funding amounts reported for 2012 were for committed funds – defined as funds allocated to an activity or project based on a commitment document, but where the funds may not have been allocated. as a result, the data may not capture multi-year projects where funds were committed in earlier years and dispersed in 2012. additionally, the average grant totals may not reflect an annual calendar and therefore could be deflated if for a multi-year project. at the same time, there is the risk for duplication of grant amounts as some of the donors sub-grant through other intermediaries or foundations that also participated in the survey. this risk was accounted for by asking groups to report if they used intermediaries, and if so, to list the intermediaries. in the one case of an existing conflict, the data from the intermediary was prioritized as that group is closer to the actual allocation of funds to groups on the ground.  Survey respondents reported figures in the currency in which they work: 12- US dollar, 4- euro, 1- british pound, 1- norwegian kroner. if not originally reported in US dollar, the amounts were converted into US dollar using the conversation rate on october 23, 2013.  funding on tRAns* issuesHow MuCH ARe donoRs giving?the current reported total level of committed 2012 funding on trans* issues is $2,372,000, representing the reported figures of 11 of the 20 survey respondents that fund specifically on trans* issues.  Due to the difficulty of reporting fund contributions specifically for these population groups, it is likely an under-representation of the funding of all 22 donors who participated in the survey. However, many of the largest known bilateral and foundation donors did report data, and if reported amounts are doubled, it still leaves global funding amounts for trans* issues at less than $5 million. this data is also comparable to a 2010 survey by the Foundation center which found that only $1.7 million or 0.14% of the $1.2 billion going to human rights funding was dedicated to both trans* and intersex issues.2 Specific funding on trans* issues is relatively new. astraea was the first surveyed donor to initiate trans* funding in 1994, and over 50% of respondents currently funding on trans* issues started 18          aDvancing tranS* MoveMentS WorlDWiDe2  http://foundationcenter.org/gainknowledge/research/pdf/humanrights_lgbt.pdfsince 2008 (10 of 19). of the two survey respondents that do not currently fund on trans* issues, one reported that they will begin doing so in 2014 or 2015.funding levels for most existing donors have increased in 2012 or will increase in 2014 or 2015. asked whether the funding on trans* issues had increased, decreased or stayed about the same since the year prior (2011) – 50% (10 of 20 respondents) reported funds had increased, 45% (9 of 20) reported that funds stayed about the same, and only one reported that funds had decreased. When asked about projected levels of funding in 2014, 75% (14 of 19) of respondents said they intended to increase money to trans* issues, 4 reported maintaining the same levels, and only one reported decreasing. Significantly, five of the donors that are increasing funds to trans* issues in 2014 had reported maintaining the same funding levels in 2013. the donor that reported decreasing levels in 2012 and in the future for trans* and intersex is one of only two donors where funds allocated for trans* people are more than 10% of the agency’s overall funding, and is currently the second biggest giver on trans* and intersex issues. the funding, however, is limited to europe.Donors were also asked about what trans* funding represents in terms of total percentage of organizational budget. For 50% of the total respondents to this question (9 of 18), trans* funding represents between 0-1% of their organizational budget, and for two organizations, trans* funding is 10-25% of the organizational budget. there were no organizations where the trans* funding was more than 25% of their organizational budget. a Meeting For FUnDerS & activiStS Working on genDer DiverSitY          192012: FUNDING TRENDON TRANS* ISSUES  (20 RESPONDENTS)Did funding increase, decrease or stay about the same since the year prior?45% 50%5%ON INTERSEX ISSUES  (12 RESPONDENTS)2014: FUNDING TRENDON TRANS* ISSUES  (19 RESPONDENTS)Do you plan to increase, decrease or maintain the same level of funding?15%80%5%ON INTERSEX ISSUES  (12 RESPONDENTS)REFERENCES: DECREASE STAY THE SAME INCREASE42% 50%8%42% 50%8%GRANT SIZES: TRANS*TRANS ISSUESSAMPLE:  19 RESPONSESMedian of average grant size$30,000TRANS-LED GROUPS $20,000the median grant  size for a typical grant  on trans* issues  is $30,000. trans* led groups receive, on average, two-thirds the funding that lGbti advocacy, hiv, or other organizations receive to work on trans* issues. the profile of groups funded on trans* issues often reflect the portfolios where the trans* work is managed—predominantly lGbti rights, sexual health and rights,  and hiv. wHAt is tHe size of gRAnts?there is great variation in the sizes of grants given on trans* issues. the largest grant sizes reported for trans* work spanned from the high of $1,092,284 to a low of $5,000, median figure of $60,000, and an average of $170,000. the reported typical grant sizes ranged from a high of $335,000 to $5,000, with the median being $30,000 and the average $60,000. the highest reported figures for the largest grant given and the typical grant size are from a donor who limits funding to europe.wHo is being funded?trans* led groups have advocated for direct funding, as opposed to funding to lgbti, Hiv or other organizations, in order to best meet the needs of their communities. ninety percent of respondents (18 of 20) fund trans*—led groups directly or indirectly (through intermediaries). of the 15 respondents who reported grants data, the number of trans*—led grantees was between the low of 1 grantee and the high of 20 grantees, with a median of 5 and an average of 7. the reported typical grant amount to trans*-led groups ranged from a high of $242,000 and low of $5,000, the median being $20,000 and the average $48,000. the average grant size to self-led trans* groups is $10,000 less or two-thirds the typical grant size to other groups working on trans* issues.When asked about the types of organizations that funders typically support to advance their trans* or intersex work (outside of trans* or intersex—led groups), the most common response was lgbti rights advocacy groups. legal service organizations figured prominently in the funding, as well as capacity building organizations. For trans* issues, lgbti service organizations were also important, although Hiv/aiDS advocacy and services organizations represented only 17% (3 of 18 respondents) and 6% (1 of 18 respondents) of types of groups supported.  20          aDvancing tranS* MoveMentS WorlDWiDethe types of groups funded aligns with the portfolios where trans* issues are most commonly managed: trans* funding most often sits within an agency’s portfolio on lgbt (7), Sexual Health or Health (5), Human rights (4),  Hiv (3), Democracy and governance (2) and other (7) which includes general grants fund, religion, arts funding. Six donors reported that their trans* and intersex funding was based on a specific government direct or policy, five of which were government funded agencies where the policy directive was related to lgbti rights and one case related to an Hiv policy. For this group of donors, advocacy was overwhelmingly the most active funding focus, as compared to direct services. wHAt is being funded?Seventy six percent of donor respondents funding trans* issues support human rights research and advocacy (16 of 21 respondents), most closely followed by awareness raising campaigns (67%, 14 of 21).

Direct health care not being prioritized could be more a function of the over-representation of human rights funders in the survey – but is notable given the generally high priority of access to health care for trans* communities. wHeRe ARe donoRs funding on tRAns* issues?the region where the highest number of respondent donors are active for trans* issues is eastern africa, followed by asia and latin america. north america was the least funded region, but as noted in the methodology, only donors working internationally were included so those funding domestically were excluded. While some donors are funding at local, national, regional and international levels, 74% of respondents (14 of 19) funding on trans* issues give to groups working at national level, 52% for local groups (10 of 19). international funding was the last priority for the respondent donors. there is a clear distinction in the way that bilaterals, or government funders, work and the way that foundations work. all bilaterals fund through intermediaries, while three of the 15 private or public foundation donor respondents on this question use intermediaries.

For this report, an intermediary is an organization that manages the re-granting for another donor according to an agreed upon proposal or framework. Working through intermediaries doesn’t necessarily change the type of funding but does implore understanding the nature of these partnerships in order to understand and, in turn, impact on the way funding is being allocated.  wHAt ARe tHe bARRieRs to funding tRAns*-led gRouPs?  the main difficulties reported by donors in funding trans*-led groups relates to challenges of supporting a nascent movement:  the limited capacity of trans* groups to either receive the funding administratively, or to do the core type of work that donors fund (i.e. advocacy). of the 9 respondents to this question, the most reported issue was the inexperience of trans* groups with funding (54%, 7 of 9 respondents), followed by the groups not being able to administer the size of grants typically given (46%, 6 of 9), difficulties reaching groups (46%, 6 of 9), and a lack of internal knowledge and expertise on trans* issues (23%, 3 of 9). other reported difficulties by some donors included language (15%, 2 of 9), no internal support from management for increased funding (15%, 2 of 9), and no support from main funding source (15%, 2 of 9). one funder spoke about the reluctance of other donors to provide core support to groups as a direct obstacle to increasing their own funds, due to the overreliance of groups on their support and the need for them to show diversification of funding sources to their board.the challenges might point to the need for donors to be flexible in the way that they fund trans*-led groups, and perhaps initially focusing on building their organizational capacity prior as part of BARRIRERS TO FINDING TRANS* GROUPSSAMPLE:  9 RESPONSESINEXPERIENCE OF GROUPS WITH FUNDING0 20% 40% 60% 80%INABILITY OF GROUPS TO ADMINISTER GRANTSDIFFICULTIES REACHING GROUPSLACK OF DONOR’S INTERNAL EXPERTISELANGUAGELACK OF MANAGEMENT’S INTERNAL SUPPORTNO SUPPORT FROM MAIN FUNDING SOURCE54%46%46%23%15%15%15%a Meeting For FUnDerS & activiStS Working on genDer DiverSitY          23Project support is still the majority of funding available on trans*  issues, and conference attendance was the most common support  offered next to grant making. the long-term advocacy and human rights funding objectives. the findings also indicate that there could be more collaboration and innovation between the trans* movement and donors in making the work of groups known, particularly to donors that aren’t based in the region where they are funding. How ARe donoRs funding?While responding donors are generally giving both project funding and general operating support grants, there is still a preference for project support. More than 57% of respondents (9 of 16) reported that more than 50% of their funding was for project grants, while only 37% (6 of 16) reported that more than 50% of their funding was for general operating support.  the funders offering the majority of their support (75-100%) as general capacity grants were all foundations, while all the bilterals reported that the vast majority of their funding was for project support.in addition to grant support, many respondents offer capacity building support to trans* -led groups. the most common additional support was overwhelmingly conference support, with 67% of donors making this available. the next two common types of support were technical trainings and mentoring, with limited scholarship and language support.

Fifty percent (6 of 12) of respondents envisioned increasing money to intersex issues, 42% (5) intend to maintain the same levels of funding, and one donor will decrease. asked about the level that intersex funding represents in terms of total percentage of organizational budget, only one foundation, that has a mission specifically on supporting the lgbti and sex worker movement, reported that intersex funding exceeds 1% of their overall funding. For the remaining 12 respondents (92%), funding on intersex remains at less than 1% of their organizational budget. wHAt is tHe size of gRAnts?the largest grant size reported on intersex issue was $75,000 and the smallest $4,650, with a median of $15,000 and an average of $26,000. the typical reported grant size ranged from $1,000 to $65,000, $5,600 being the median and $20,300 the average.

When asked about the types of organizations that funders typically support outside of intersex-led groups to advance this work, similar to trans* issues, lgbti right advocacy groups, legal service organizations, and capacity building organizations were the most common.  intersex funding most often sits within an agency’s portfolio on lgbti rights (6 of the 10 respondents), sexual health program (2), democracy and governance (1) and human rights (1).  wHAt is being funded?the most common responses by donors funding intersex was awareness raising campaigns (71%, 10 of 14), human rights research and advocacy (64%, 9 of 14), education and training (for example with police, service providers, doctors) (36%, 5 of 15), and direct social services: support groups, counseling, vocational/job training, literacy, etc. (29%, 4 of 15). areas of funding that were not prioritized for intersex included education, arts and culture, and religion.

Most current funders included in the survey stated intentions to increase funding levels in the near future. However, current funding levels are so abysmal that addressing the grave human rights needs calls for a dramatic increase in the level of funding. this will likely require pulling new donors into the field that are aligned with the articulated needs of trans* groups.  this could be, for example, funds focused on universal health care, poverty reduction, livelihood programs, and citizenship issues. While largely situated in lgbti or Sexual Health portfolios, trans* and intersex issues could inform other areas of funding. the analysis of marginalization and abuse trans* and intersex individuals face informs power struggles on race relations, women and girl’s rights, youth rights, minority rights, migrant and immigrant rights, and many others. the response that trans* and intersex communities are pushing includes civil society and citizen participation, access to justice, health care access and delivery and policy reform, access to education, poverty reduction, prison reform, Hiv, employment and livelihood services and policies, among others. to help with promoting more inter-sectorial and cross-issues responses, donors should consider whether they could better track the funds going to support trans* and intersex communities.  additionally, trans* and intersex work should be better integrated into other donor portfolios. looking foRwARd the data from this report is indicative of trends and issues in how the trans* and intersex movements are supported. this meeting is an opportunity for donors and activists concerned with the rights of these communities to better understand the issues, and to work collaboratively to find and support effective solutions. Some questions for consideration are listed below. a Meeting For FUnDerS & activiStS Working on genDer DiverSitY          29How can we bring new donors into this funding arena?given that trans* and intersex issues are currently conceptualized within donor portfolios on lgbti Rights, Human Rights, sexual Rights and other issues – what other intersectionalities should be considered to expand funding to trans* and intersex organizations? Many donors are providing additional capacity building support, or are funding organizations dedicated to capacity building, as a critical part of their strategy. an analysis of this support would be useful in terms of effectiveness to address the most critical capacity needs identified by groups. it should also be compared with data on what trans* and intersex led groups reported to be most needed and useful in terms of type of support and the ways it is delivered.Donors are very interested in supporting self-led groups, and have already offered substantial levels of support. there still remains, however, a significant gap in the level of funding offered to groups working on trans* issues that could be lgbti, Hiv or other types of organizations, and those that are trans-led. Donors themselves identified some real barriers to funding self-led groups, including their own organizational and/or staff capacity. as part of the discussion on supporting these movements, agencies should consider how they are staffing this work and also including trans* and intersex experts in the development, monitoring and evaluation of funding portfolios. 30          aDvancing tranS* MoveMentS WorlDWiDegiven that trans* and intersex issues are currently conceptualized within donor portfolios on lgbti Rights, Human Rights, sexual Rights and other issues – what other intersectionalities should be considered to expand funding to trans* and intersex organizations? what is the importance of investing in trans* or intersex-led groups? what leadership strategies should be invested in towards the aim of supporting self-led groups?• UHAI EASHRI• Fund for Global Human Rights• Hivos• Mama Cash• Freedom House• Fund for Global Human Rights• Mama Cash• Sigrid Rausing Trust• amfAR•  Australian Department of Foreign affairs and trade• Elton John AIDS Foundation• Hivos•  United States Agency for international Development • amfAR•  Australian Department of Foreign affairs and trade• Elton John AIDS Foundation•  United States Agency for international Development • amfAR•  United States Agency for international Development •  Dutch Ministry of Education— culture and Sciences—Department for gender and lgbt equality,•  Fund for Global Human Rights•  Hivos•  Mama Cash•  United States Department of State, Democracy, Human rights and labor•  UHAI EASHRI•  Ford Foundation•  Freedom House•  Fund for Global Human Rights•  Hivos•  Mama Cash•  Open Society Foundations•  Sigrid Rausing Trust•  United States Agency for international Development •  United States Department of State, Democracy, Human rights and labor•  Freedom House•  United States Department of State, Democracy, Human rights and labor•  Urgent Action FundHiv/Aids RelAted  outReACH And  PReventionHiv/Aids tReAtMent  And otHeR seRviCesdiReCt HeAltHCARe not RelAted to Hiv/Aids: HoRMone PResCRiPtion, doCtoR’s CliniC, suRgeRY, tHeRAPY, etC.diReCt soCiAl seRviCes: suPPoRt gRouPs, Counseling,  voCAtionAl/Job  tRAining, liteRACY, etC.legAl seRviCes: legAl defense, CouRt CAses, stRAtegiC litigAtion, lAwYeR’s fees etC.eMeRgenCY seRviCeswHo is funding wHAt?a Meeting For FUnDerS & activiStS Working on genDer DiverSitY          31seRviCe PRovision tRAns* inteRsex•  Dutch Ministry of Education—culture and Sciences—Department for gender and lgbt equality•  Freedom House•  Fund for Global Human Rights•  Heinrich Boell Foundation•  Hivos•  Levi Strauss Foundation•  Mama Cash•  Norwegian Ministry of Foreign affairs•  Open Society Foundations•  Sigrid Rausing Trust•  UHAI EASHRI•  United States Agency for international Development •  United States Department of State, Democracy, Human rights and labor•  Dreilinden gGmbH•  Freedom House•  Fund for Global Human Rights•  Heinrich Boell Foundation•  Mama Cash•  Norwegian Ministry of Foreign affairs•  Sigrid Rausing Trust•  UHAI EASHRI•  Freedom House•  Hivos•  Mama Cash•  Urgent Action Fund for Women’s Human rights•  amfAR•  Dutch Ministry of Education—culture and Sciences—Department for gender and lgbt equality•  Freedom House•  Fund for Global Human Rights•  Heinrich Boell Foundation•  Mama Cash•  Open Society Foundations•  Sigrid Rausing Trust•  Urgent Action Fund for Women’s Human rights•  USAID Office of HIV/AIDS•  UHAI EASHRI•  United States Agency for international Development •  United States Department of State, Democracy, Human rights and labor• Freedom House• Mama Cash• Sigrid Rausing Trust• Dreilinden gGmbH• Freedom House• Fund for Global Human Rights• Heinrich Boell Foundation• Hivos• Mama Cash• Open Society Foundations• Sigrid Rausing Trust• UHAI EASHRIHuMAn RigHts  ReseARCH And  AdvoCACYwoMen’s RigHts /  gendeR /feMinisMAwAReness-RAising CAMPAignswHo is funding wHAt?

    "abstract": "This report serves a number of purposes. The first is to capture the discussions and outcomes towards better coordination and collaboration on trans* and intersex funding. Included are concrete recommendations at the organizational level that could improve an individual donor's approach to funding on trans* and intersex issues, as well as ideas about how to collaboratively and strategically support these movements. The second purpose is to document the methodologyof organizing a donor/activist convening in a collaborative manner. The means to the end of improving the amount and quality of funding is critical. A collaborative process between donors and activists resulted in a meeting that is more relevant, and that builds the capacity of donorsand activists. The first two sections of this report outline the suggested next steps and actions coming out of the dialogue, and document the meeting methodology. They are followed by a number of sections that provide reflections on the different presentations and discussions thattook place over the two days. The report finishes with recommendations to donor organizations, and trans* and intersex activists and groups.",
