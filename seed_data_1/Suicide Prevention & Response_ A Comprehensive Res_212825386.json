Suicide is also the 2nd leading cause of death among teenagers (CDC, 2016).  Below are a few facts about suicide:  Indiana has the 3rd highest rate (1 in 5) of high school students in the nation who have contemplated suicide. Indiana tied for the 10th highest percentage (1 in 9) of high school students attempting suicide. Males are 4 times more likely to die by suicide than females. Females are 3 times more likely to attempt suicide than males. Suicide is the 3rd leading cause of death for youth aged 10-14. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for you aged 15-24. The statistics are alarming, and death by suicide is one of Indiana’s most concerning health issues. However, there is help and hope when parents, schools, and communities join forces to address suicide as a preventable public health problem.  Critical Points: What Schools Need to Know & Share  School personnel are frequently considered the first line of contact in reaching suicidal students. While most school personnel are neither qualified nor expected to provide an in-depth assessment or counseling necessary when working with a suicidal student, they are responsible for taking reasonable and prudent actions to help these students. All school personnel need to know that protocols exist to refer at-risk students to trained professionals so that the burden of responsibility does not rest solely with the individual “on the scene”. Research has shown that talking about suicide or asking students if they are thinking about suicide will not put the idea in their head or cause them to kill themselves. Given the widespread stigma around suicide, most people who are contemplating suicide do not know with whom to speak. By talking openly and being available to students, school personnel may be able to help an individual see there are other options and/or give the student time to rethink his/her decision, thereby preventing suicide. School personnel, parents/guardians, and students need to be confident that help is availableif/when they raise concerns regarding suicidal behavior. Studies show that students often know, but do not tell adults, about suicidal peers because they do not know how adults will respond or assume they can’t help. Advanced planning and practice is critical to providing an effective crisis response. Internal and external resources must be in place to address student issues and to normalize the learning environment for everyone. Suicide is preventable, therefore we can take steps toward decreasing the odds of a suicide attempt.o Increasing student and community awareness might include posting resources in locations around the school, on social media, in student handbooks, etc. Ease of access and reducing the stigma of reaching out for help are important steps towards preventing suicide. Resources might include the following: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255); text options, such as Families First (text CSIS to 839863) or Mental Health America of Tippecanoe (call or text Safe2Talk to 765-742-0244), and any additional supportive resources within the school and local community. 4 Cultural Issues in Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention The students and families that school personnel interact with, comprise an increasingly diverse group with individualized needs. The acceptability of student’s mental health services is highly influenced by attitudes, beliefs, and practices from their families’ cultures of origin.1 Being culturally responsive assumes that no single “best” way exists to conceptualize human behavior or explain the realities and experiences of diverse cultural groups. Rather, it is best to understand that everyone has a unique culture, and that cultural influences are woven into personality like a tapestry.2 From this perspective, three recommendations for education professionals include: (1) developing a broad knowledge and awareness of cross-cultural variations in child development and parenting; (2) integrating this knowledge in a relevant way to offer more informed assessments and interventions; and (3) developing a culturally sensitive attitude and approach in all interactions with students and their families.3 It is important to recognize that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth are often at higher risk for being the target of bullying, and they have higher rates of suicide than their peers. Generally, LGBTQ youth have more, and more severe risk factors, and fewer protective factors than heterosexual youth.4 It is important for schools to increase support for these students, provide a strength-based approach, and implement programs to safeguard and support LGBTQ students. Resources are available from organizations such as the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network (https://www.glsen.org/) and the Trevor Project (http://www.thetrevorproject.org).  The table below provides an overview of key facts from the suicide questions among the racial/ethnic youth populations in Indiana from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey.5 In the past year… Whites Blacks Hispanics Multiple Races Heterosexual Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Total *IndianaSeriously considered attempting suicide 19.8% 22.2% 23.8% 25.9% 15.2% 46.4% 19.8% Made a suicide plan 17.0% 19.1% 20.9% 23.5% 13.0% 42.8% 17.0% Attempted suicide 9.9% 14.5% 15.5% 10.5% 6.8% 34.2% 9.9% Suicide attempt that had to be treated by a doctor or nurse 3.9% 9.2% 6.7% 5.3% 3.0% 11.1% 3.9% 1 Pumariega, A.J., Joshi, S.V.

(August 2015).  5 Indiana Youth Risk Behavior System Survey, 2015.  5 Indiana Requirements for Youth Suicide Awareness and Prevention Suicide Prevention Policy (IC 20-26-5-34.4) Per IC 20-26-5-34.4, school corporations shall adopt a policy addressing measures intended to increase child suicide awareness and prevention. The policy must address the following: 1) Counseling services for the child and the child’s family related to suicide prevention.2) Availability of referral information for crisis intervention to children, parents, and schoolcorporation staff.3) Increasing awareness of the relationship between suicide and drug and alcohol use.4) Training on warning signs and tendencies that may evidence that a child is considering suicide.5) Availability of information concerning suicide prevention services in the community.6) Cooperation among the school corporation and suicide prevention services in the community.7) Development of a plan to assist survivors of attempted suicide and to assist children and schoolcorporation staff in coping with an attempted suicide or death of a student or school employee.8) Development of any other program or activity that is appropriate.Youth Suicide Awareness and Prevention Training (IC 20-28-3-6) Per IC 20-28-3-6, superintendents, principals, teachers, librarians, school counselors, school psychologists, school nurses, and school social workers employed at schools that provide instruction to students in grades 5-12, are required to participate in at least 2 hours of youth suicide awareness and prevention training every 3 school years. The training must be during the employee’s contracted day or at a time chosen by the employee; shall count toward professional development requirements; must be demonstrated to be an effective or promising program and recommended by the Indiana suicide Prevention Network Advisory Council.   6 SUICIDE RESPONSE PROTOCOLS This section provides best practice recommendations, procedures, and protocol. Policy Per Indiana statute, all school corporations are required to adopt a policy addressing suicide awareness and prevention. The purpose of a suicide policy is to protect the health and well-being of all students by having procedures in place to prevent, assess the risk of, intervene, and respond to suicide. A policy covers actions that occur in school, on school property, at school-sponsored events, on school buses or school-owned vehicles, and at school sponsored out-of-school events where school staff are present. See Appendix B for a sample policy for Indiana school corporations. Suicide Response The school corporation should establish policies and procedures for intervening when students are observed or suspected to be experiencing emotional or behavioral distress. It is recommended that every school in the corporation use the same suicide screening and risk assessment tool and documentation practices.  It is important to remember that a student who is considering suicide has not done anything wrong and all efforts should be made to listen and empathize with his/her situation and provide appropriate support.  IN-School Suicide Attempts In the case of an in-school suicide attempt, the health and safety of the student is paramount. In these situations: 1. First Aid will be rendered until professional medical treatment and/or transportation can bereceived, following direct emergency medical procedures. Mental health support will be providedas appropriate.2. The student’s parent or guardian will be contacted, unless a delay in notification is warranted.3. School staff will supervise the student to ensure his/her safety.4. Staff will move all other students out of the immediate area as quickly as possible.5. Staff will immediately notify the principal and school suicide prevention coordinator.6. The school will engage as necessary, the crisis team to assess whether additional steps should betaken to ensure the safety and well-being of other students.7. Mental health services will be offered, when appropriate, for students and teachers affected by thesuicide attempt.8. If appropriate, staff will immediately request a mental health (risk) assessment of any studentsuspected to be at-risk of suicide. The family should get their child a full psychiatric assessmentprior to his/her return to school. For more information, see the memo here.Out-of-School Suicide Attempts If a staff member becomes aware of a suicide attempt by a student this is in progress in and out-of-school location, the staff member will: 7 1. Call the police and/or emergency medical services, such as 911.2. Inform the student’s parent or guardian.3. Inform the school suicide prevention coordinator, or designee, district coordinator, and/orsuperintendent.If the student contacts the staff member and expresses suicidal ideation, the staff member should maintain contact with the student (either in person, online, or on the phone). The staff member should enlist the assistance of another person to contact the police while maintaining verbal engagement with the student.   Re-Entry Students who have made a suicide attempt are at an increased risk to attempt to harm themselves again. Having a streamlined and well-planned re-entry process ensures the safety and well-being of students who have previously attempted suicide and reduces the risk of another attempt. An appropriate re-entry process is an important component of suicide prevention and is considered best practice. Educators can help return students by directly involving both the family and the student in planning for his/her return to school. This will provide the student with a sense of control, personal responsibility, and empowerment and sets a tone for collaboration and unified support for the student.  Confidentiality is extremely important in protecting the student and enabling school personnel to provide assistance. Although necessary for continuity of care, it is often difficult to obtain appropriate information in order to assist the student. If possible, secure a signed release from parents/guardians to communicate with the hospital or the student’s outside mental health therapist/counselor. Meeting with parents/guardian about their child prior to his/her return to school is integral to making decisions concerning the needed supports, the student’s preferences and concerns, and to begin discussing any possible changes to the student’s schedule. For students returning to school after a suicide-related mental health crisis (e.g., suicide attempt or psychiatric hospitalization), the school counselor/school social worker/mental health counselor, principal, and suicide prevention coordinator (or designee), will meet with the student’s parent/guardian to ensure the student’s readiness to return to school (see Appendix P for Re-entry protocol and documentation template).  1. A school employed mental health professional or suicide prevention coordinator will be identified to help coordinate the re-entry with the student, parent/guardian, and any outside mental health care providers.2. Prior to the student’s return, a meeting between designated school personnel (such as the suicide prevention coordinator or designee), student, and parents/guardian should be scheduled to discuss possible arrangements for support services and to create an individualized re-entry plan.3. The re-entry coordinator/team will:a. Review or update the student’s safety plan.b. Discuss any additional support the student may need.c. Provide an update to the staff that have a legitimate educational interest prior to the student returning to the classroom; walk through how to respond to student’s questions about where they have been, avoiding triggers, etc.i. Classroom teachers do need to know information pertinent to the academic plan and be updated on the student’s progress in general. They do not need clinical information or detailed history.ii. See Appendix L, Safety Plan: Instructions for Teachers/Support Staff, which provides guidance on what information is best to share with teachers. It is important to share key details with all educators that the student will have for class throughout the school day to ensure a consistent care plan is provided. 8 4. A designated staff person will periodically check in with the student to help the student readjustto the school community and address any ongoing concerns. The suicide risk-monitoring tool(Appendix J) may also be utilized during this check-in with the student.a. Given the high risk for suicide following discharge from inpatient hospitalization, it isimportant to follow-up with students to monitor suicide risk following re-entry into theschool setting. The risk-monitoring tool provides school mental health professionals theopportunity to compare the student’s current suicide risk with their baseline levels of riskfollowing hospitalization.6 Like progress monitoring, this tool can be used to gathersuicide risk data over time, which can assist in strengthening the student’s safety plan andrelevant school-based intervention. See Suicide in Schools: A Practitioner’s Guide toMulti-level Prevention, Assessment, Intervention, and Postvention and Suicide RiskMonitoring: The Missing Piece in Suicide Risk Assessment for more information.5. The designated staff person will periodically check in with the parent/guardian to address anyongoing concerns or provide additional support if possible/needed. Additional supports couldinclude exploring the need for a 504 or special education assessment.Roles It is critical that the school corporation ensure that all school employees act only within the authorization and scope of his/her credential and license. The recommendations for actions provided by role shall not be construed as authorizing or encouraging a school employee to assess or counsel a suicidal student unless he/she is specifically licensed, trained, and employed to do so.  School Administrator:  The role of a school administrator includes:  being informed of a student at risk of suicide; informing the school suicide prevention coordinator; assisting with care coordination (i.e., referral to psychiatric assessment/treatment, returning toschool, parent involvement, school absences); and ensuring that all pertinent individuals are aware of plans to address the needs of the student (e.g.,suicide prevention coordinator).When an administrator becomes aware of a student that may be at risk for suicide, the following steps should be taken:  ensure the student has met with the Suicide Prevention Coordinator to determine the level of risk; follow-up with the Suicide Prevention Coordinator regarding communication with the student’sparents/guardians; communicate with the Suicide Prevention Coordinator regarding the safety plan (see Appendix Lfor Safety Plan templates) and follow up recommendations for the student; assist with notifying necessary teachers/school personnel involved in the student’s safety plan andfollow up recommendations; and assist in the development of a follow-up plan, which may include a check-in with the studentwithin 2 weeks of re-entry and/or assessment.6 Ho, T-P. (2003). The suicide risk of discharged psychiatric patients. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 64, 702-707. Retrieved from http://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/pages/home.aspx 9 Suicide Prevention Coordinator: District Level A Suicide Prevention Coordinator at the district level may be designated by the Superintendent and may be an existing district employee. The district level coordinator will be responsible for planning and coordinating the implementation of the corporation policy and procedures.  Building Level Each building principal may designate a school suicide prevention coordinator to act as a point of contact in each school for issues related to suicide prevention and policy implementation. It is recommended that this position at the building level be a School Counselor, School Social Worker, mental health counselor or someone with appropriate credentials and training to conduct the suicide screening and risk assessments. The Suicide Prevention Coordinator should serve as the point person for assessment and intervention.  *The district and building level coordinators are considered best practice (or recommended) but are not positions required by law. Referrals should be made to a School Counselor, School Social Worker, or mental health professional in the event that the school doesn’t have a Suicide Prevention Coordinator.Recommended Trainings for District and Building-level Suicide Prevention Coordinators School personnel who are selected to serve in the Suicide Prevention Coordinator role may need additional training. It is suggested that coordinators be competent in both knowledge and skills on the topics listed below.   Suicide Risk Assessment: Provide appropriate training on the suicide risk assessment tool that isselected by the school corporation. Safety Planning: Safety training manual and additional training information can be found here. Counseling on Access to Lethal Means (CALM): Access to lethal means can determine whether aperson who is suicidal lives or dies. This course explains why means restriction is an importantpart of a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention. It will teach how to ask suicidal youthabout their access to lethal means, and work with them and their families to reduce access. Community Resources: Such as grief education for educators, parents and community members.An example is Brooke’s Place for Grieving Young People, an organization that provides griefworkshops to educators: Understanding and Supporting Children and Adolescents Living withGrief. It is important to have knowledge and skills in grief support and counseling when servingboth students and families. Postvention: Postvention knowledge and skills help put protocols in place in a school communityafter a suicide to reduce the risk of future suicide deaths. An example would include NOVAtraining.School Counselor/School Social Worker/Mental Health Counselor: The role of the School Counselor/School Social Worker/Mental Health Counselor is to determine the level of suicide risk, communicate with parents about their child’s risk, develop collaborative safety plans, and communicate with administrators regarding recommendations and follow-up support as needed. The following action items are recommended:   Complete a risk assessment (see Appendix J).o It is recommended that every school in the district use the same risk assessment anddocumentation practices.10 o Ask questions about risk in a conversational way, encouraging the student to talk asneeded. Talking can help reduce the intensity of their distress/suicide thoughts. Communicate with the student regarding contacting parents. *Contact the parent or guardian when there is any risk for harm to inform of the situation and to request active involvement in support for the student. Include the student in the conversation when possible and appropriate. The following should be addressed with the parent:o seriousness of the situation and not to assume the student is seeking attention;o a list of community mental health agencies/counselors (recommend developing a workgroup comprised of mental health partners/agencies to create a pipeline of mental health services for students and families);o information about when it is necessary to seek outside professional help;o the need for ongoing and continuous monitoring at home (see Appendix O for Parent Resources);o increasing safety measures in the home, ensuring the home is free of potential safety concerns (see Appendix L, O);o the desire and importance of working collaboratively with the student;o the need to follow a safety plan and update it as needed;o a request for a release of information form so communication between the school and outside health provider may occur to best support the student;o a request for the parent/guardian to stay in contact with the school and to be involved at the re-entry meeting for the student (see Appendix P);o when appropriate, assist family with urgent referral and/or calling emergency services;o support for families who don’t speak or understand English, which may require an interpreter, etc. (students should not be translating to their family members).*If it is determined that contacting the parent or guardian could endanger the health or well-being of the student, parent contact may be delayed as appropriate, and DCS and/or local law enforcement should be notified immediately. The school in this scenario, should document reasons for which parents were not immediately notified and information that demonstrates the student’s health or well-being was assumed to be in danger.*If reasonable attempts to reach the parent/guardian or adult in whose custody the student may be released are not successful, the case will be treated as a medical emergency and medical services and/or local law enforcement should be contacted. Documentation of all parties attempted to be reached should be made. Develop a safety plan for the student. When possible, this should be developed collaboratively with the student, parent, and any other individual(s) determined to be appropriate. The safety plan should be shared with school administration and other personnel who may be involved in the implementation of the plan (see Appendix L for sample safety plans). Once imminent risk to harm oneself or others is shared or assumed, confidentiality is not maintained (no longer considered privileged communication). Communicate with the school administrator regarding the imminent risk (danger to self and others), the risk level, recommendations, and collaborative safety plan. All actions and assessments must be documented and stored in a secure place.o Maintain a complete record of screening and assessment results; behavioral observations; information; and actions taken including dates, times, individuals involved; a copy of the safety plan, phone calls, conversations, and follow-up.o Documents should be placed in the Suicide Prevention Coordinator’s office in a locked cabinet that is separate from academic student files. Documentation should NOT be placed in the student’s permanent file. It is critical to keep this documentation separate, secure, and confidential. 11  Provide the administrator and suicide prevention coordinator with information regarding follow-up services, re-entry plan and recommendations for the student’s return to school. Failure on the part of the family to take seriously and provide for the safety of the student in caseof potential suicide may be considered emotional neglect and reported to the Indiana Departmentof Child Services.School Personnel The role of school personnel is to inquire about concerns regarding student safety and notify the school suicide prevention coordinator. When school personnel become aware of a student who has thoughts of self-harm/suicide, they should respond in the following ways:  Do not hesitate to ask the student if he/she has been or is thinking about suicide (see Appendix H, What Can I Say). Listen to the student with an open and non-judgmental stance. Do not dismiss or undervalue what the person is saying; all suicidal talk should be taken seriously. Be supportive and offer hope by assuring that everything possible will be done to provide assistance and support. Immediately notify the suicide prevention coordinator who will complete a risk screener to ensure safety. Notify a school administrator regarding the potential risk. Do not leave the student unsupervised and immediately walk him/her to a counselor or administrator. Document the date, time, individual(s) involved, summary of conversation, etc. and share with the Suicide Prevention Coordinator (see Appendix I, Staff Documentation Form). Following the referral, debrief with appropriate staff involved in the student’s referral process(avoid sharing details that may be considered privileged communication or unnecessary details that the student may wish to remain private). Assessments A corporation-approved suicide assessment may be utilized by trained mental health staff, such as School Counselors, School Social Workers, or School Psychologists. It is recommended that at least three school personnel are trained to screen for the level of risk for imminent harm. It is important to ensure that all School Counselors, School Social Workers, School Nurses, and School Psychologists have the necessary training in suicide risk assessment and screening before assigning this responsibility to their role.  Suicide Screening vs. Suicide Assessment Suicide prevention experts usually use the term suicide screening to refer to a procedure in which a standardized instrument or protocol is used to identify individuals who may be at risk for suicide. Suicide screening can be done independently or as a part of a more comprehensive health or behavioral health screening. Screening may be done orally (with the screener asking questions), with paper and pencil, or using a computer. Suicide assessment usually refers to a more comprehensive evaluation done by a School Counselor/School Social Worker/mental health counselor to confirm suspected suicide risk, estimate the immediate danger to the student, and decide on a course of action. Although assessments can involve structured questionnaires, they also can include a more open-ended conversation with a student, friends, teachers, and/or family to gain insight into the student’s thoughts and behaviors, risk factors (e.g. 12 access to lethal means or a history of suicide attempts), protective factors (e.g., immediate family support), and medical and mental health history.7  Support for Students Schools should be prepared to offer the following support to students: • School Counselor/Social Worker/Nurse have a current list of community-based mental healthresources to provide to parents, if needed.o At minimum, a list of mental health providers, their hours, approximate costs/slidingscale fees, location(s), and contact names and numbers should be in an informationpacket.• School employees, including the suicide prevention coordinator or designee and teachers(s), willcollaborate with the family and community resource(s) involved to prepare for re-entry and tocontinue to monitor the student’s safety plan and additional supports needed.• Counselingo In-School: School Counselors, School Social Workers, School Psychologists, Nurses, andother appropriate school personnel are available to provide support andcounseling to students who are victims or alleged victims of abuse. School employees should act only within the authorization and scope of theircredential or license. Only those employees with counseling expertise shouldprovide counseling services.o Community Community referrals may need to be made as necessary. The school should havea list of community resources available for the student and family. A signed release form may be necessary to communicate with communitycounselors/therapist.• Multidisciplinary/Student support/intervention team meetings should occur for the purpose ofproviding services and supports to students in need. To the extent permitted by confidentialitylaws, information may be shared and concerns discussed to coordinate planning services for thestudent. Appropriate school personnel may also request information outside of the team meetingto coordinate services that may be provided in the community.• Academic support available, if needed, for a child to continue to be successful in school.• In the case of a student suicide, postvention plans need to be implemented.If a suicide occurs, the following support should be available.  Designate a safe room with counseling support for as long as it’s needed. At least two mentalhealth-trained professionals should be present.o Students sign in and out of room (important to ensure student safety and so follow-up canoccur with students)o Students should be escorted to and from the room. Make information about grief available in the main and guidance offices and safe room (bothgeneral grief and complicated grief as it relates to suicide).7 Suicide Prevention Resource Center, Suicide Screening and Assessment [Online]. (September 2014). 13 POSTVENTION A death by suicide in the school community (whether by a student or staff member) can have devastating consequences on students and staff. Therefore, it is vital to be prepared in the event of such a tragedy. A school corporation’s suicide death response action plan and postvention plan should incorporate both immediate and long-term steps and objectives.  Development and Implementation of an Action Plan: The crisis team, in collaboration with the suicide prevention coordinator, will develop an action plan to guide school response following a death by suicide. All team members should have training in postvention response and practice drills at least yearly.  The following steps are encouraged following a death by suicide: 1. The crisis team meets. The team should meet as soon as possible to implement the action plan following the news of the suicide death of a student, staff member, or active volunteer (see After a Suicide Toolkit, pages 10-14).2. Identify a staff member to confirm death and cause (school site administrator or designee). Staff will confirm the death through communication with the coroner’s office, local hospital, the student’s parent/guardian, or police department. Even when a case is assumed to be an instance of suicide, it should not be labeled as such until after a cause of death ruling has been made. If the cause of death has been confirmed a suicide but the parent or guardian will not permit the cause of death to be disclosed, the school should not share the cause of death but will use the opportunity to discuss suicide prevention with students.3. Assess the situation. The crisis team will meet to prepare the postvention response, consider how severely the death is likely to affect other students, determine which students are most likely to be affected, etc. Be sure that with parent permission, siblings/relatives of the deceased are told separately, before communicating to other students. The crisis team will also consider how recently other traumatic events have occurred within the school community and the time of year of the suicide. If the death occurred during a school vacation, the need for or scale of postvention activities may look differently or be reduced. Also consider the need to notify other schools in the district, particularly schools who may have students related to the student in crisis.4. Share information. Before the death is officially classified a suicide by the coroner’s office, the death can and should be reported to staff, students, and parents/guardians with an acknowledgement that the cause is unknown. Inform the faculty that a sudden death has occurred, preferably in a staff meeting. Prepare a statement for staff members to share with students. The statement should include the basic facts of the death and known funeral arrangements (without providing details of the suicide method), recognition of the sorrow the news brings, and information about resources available to help students cope with their grief.  Public address system announcements and school-wide assemblies should not be used to deliver this news. The crisis team may prepare a letter (with the input and permission from the student’s parent or guardian) to send home with students that includes facts about the death, information about what the school is doing to support students, the warning signs of suicidal behavior, mental health awareness, and a list of resources available (see After a Suicide Toolkit, pp. 15, 17-19).a. Coordinate an all-staff meeting to include:i. notification (if not already conducted) to staff about suicide death;ii. emotional support and resources available to staff;iii. notification to students about suicide death that is developmentally appropriate and the availability of support;iv. services (if this is protocol determined to be appropriate by administration); &v. information that is relevant and that which the school has permission to disclose.b. Prepare staff to respond to needs of students regarding the following: 14 i. review of protocols for referring students for support/assessment;ii. talking points for staff to notify students;iii. mental health resources available to students (in-school and within thecommunity); andiv. review suicide warning signs.5. Avoid suicide contagion. It should be explained in the staff meeting described above, that one purpose of trying to identify and give services to other high-risk students is to prevent another death by suicide. The crisis team will work with teachers to identify students who are most likely to be significantly affected by the death (both those close to the deceased as well as those who have current mental health or other known life struggles). In the staff meeting, the crisis team will review suicide warning signs and procedures for reporting students who generate concern (see After a Suicide Toolkit, pp 43-45).6. Initiate/provide support services.  Qualified school staff will meet with each student suspected to be more affected to determine if suicide risk is present. The crisis team will coordinate support services for students and staff in need of individual and small group counseling as needed. In concert with parents or guardians, crisis team members will refer to community mental health providers to ensure a smooth transition from the crisis intervention phase to meeting underlying or ongoing mental health needs (see After a Suicide Toolkit, pp. 29-30). School personnel may want to consider the following:a. students related to the deceased student;b. students who are having an unusually strong reaction to the death;c. the deceased student’s closest friends;d. the deceased student’s current or former dating partners;e. teammates, members of the same clubs or classes;f. students with a history of suicidal thoughts or behaviors;g. students who have dealt with a recent crisis or loss (or have had loves ones die by suicide); andh. students experiencing mental health problems or other vulnerabilities.When possible, parents may be encouraged to add their children to the list if they have concerns.7. Develop memorial plans. The school should not create physical memorials (e.g. photos, flowers) on school grounds, hold funeral services, or fly the flag at half-mast because it may sensationalize the death and encourage suicide contagion. School should not be cancelled for the funeral. Any school-based memorials (e.g., small gatherings) will include a focus on how to prevent future suicides, increase mental health awareness, reduce stigma, and make prevention resources available (see After a Suicide Toolkit, pp. 35-39).a. It is not a safe practice to hold a candlelight vigil, a memorial service, or erect a permanent memorial (such as a plaque, bench, or tree) at the school in the case of any student death, as these practices could contribute to sensationalizing suicide or students considering suicide as a means to gain admiration or attention.b. Acceptable “living memorials” that decrease the risk of suicide contagion, reduce stigma associated with suicide, and increase mental health awareness include:i. A student-led suicide prevention initiative supervised by one or more faculty members. It is also suggested to have mental health providers available at this event.ii. A donation or fundraiser for a local crisis service or mental health care provider.iii. Participation as a school in a local suicide awareness event.iv. Hosting a suicide prevention or potsvention training for students, staff, and/or families. 15 8. Next Steps. The school should return to a normal schedule as quickly as possible, withaccommodations available for students who have been identified at elevated risk.Accommodations should be discussed on a case-by-case basis and provided in accordance withthe school’s intervention procedures.a. Remove the deceased students name from the school attendance roster, automated callsystem, any other place that a call home would be initiated.b. If possible, reconvene staff 2-3 days following the death to focus on the following:i. review and make adjustments to crisis plan implementation;ii. any emerging needs among the student body or community;iii. discussion of students identified as at risk and what they need;iv. appreciations to helpful colleagues;v. self-care plan implementation for all staff; andvi. sharing of mental health resources in community-encourage support for staff andstudents (normalize seeking support).c. Crisis debriefing. Debriefing will help staff, students, and crisis team members reflect onthe successes and challenges of the school and district responses. Debriefing is critical tohandling the next crisis better and should focus on staff self-care and processimprovement. It is advised not only to provide debriefing throughout the immediate daysfollowing the crisis, but also after some time has passed allowing for further reflection onthe crisis event.16 COMMUNICATION Notification of School Personnel  Death During Out of School Hours 1. Upon verification, the principal will notify the Superintendent, the Suicide PreventionCoordinator, other appropriate administrators, and crisis team.2. Enact crisis response plan as deemed appropriate.Death that Occurs during School Hours 1. Follow administrative and staff actions as above.2. Convene emergency meeting of crisis response team. The team will meet immediately to develop a plan and delegate responsibilities. This should include a communication plan:a. Determine who will contact familyb. Prepare a written statement of the factsc. Plan for contact with relatives, friends of studentd. Determine who will be available for supporte. Identify and plan to support teachers who are uncomfortable or not able to tell studentsf. Plan how to interface with mediag. Determine whether to involve outside consultants/counselors if needed and appropriateh. Determine who else should be notified (parents of friends, colleagues, etc.)i. Determine who will collect student’s personal belongings (only immediate need for items in classroom); this should be done when students are not in the buildingj. Communicate information about upcoming staff meeting (if applicable)3. Since most staff will be teaching, they should be notified on the basic facts (what, when, who) and advised to follow designated procedures as outlined on the notification. Explain there will be a staff meeting (after school, if possible) with additional information and time to ask questions and gain support. Staff Meeting 1. If a general staff meeting is held prior to informing students of the death, the meeting shouldfocus on reviewing procedures for faculty meeting (see Appendix R).2. Staff should be made aware of those students who are “at risk” or “high risk” or other studentswho may not voluntarily seek help and should be referred. Teachers would most likely know whothe student’s closest friends were and could provide a short list to the office. See Appendices S, Tfor guidance on talking to students about suicide.3. If the general staff meeting is held after students are informed, the meeting should focus onreviewing the day’s events, providing time for sharing, and identifying students who may needadditional support.4. In either case, great sensitivity should be taken in responding to staff member needs. Staff will beexperiencing all the feelings associated with the death and availability of support for them shouldalso be stressed. They should especially be encouraged to meet with a support staff person ormental health provider if they are experiencing guilt related to unobserved warning signs from thestudent or related to actions they may have taken with the student (discipline, grades, etc.)17 Notification to Students  Death During Out of School Hours 1. Crisis team members should contact close friends as soon as possible as they arrive at school tonotify them and stress the availability of support. If possible, parents of the close friends shouldbe notified first – allowing parents to be there when their child finds out or if the parent prefers totell the child.2. All other students should be notified from a statement prepared by the crisis response team andsuicide prevention coordinator to be shared during the first period of the day.Death that Occurs during School Hours 1. As the staff is being informed, those students who were closest to the person who has died bysuicide should be informed in small groups by a school-based mental health professional. Parentsof these students should also be contacted. In addition, the following guidelines should beobserved.a. If the student is already in a “risk” category and/or if the student is extremely upset andindicates he/she may be suicidal, a preliminary assessment of suicidal risk should bedone.b. Stress the availability of support the student can seek in and out of school.c. Give student the option of returning to class or continuing to meet with support personneld. Students may be allowed to leave school only if accompanied by a parent or guardian(request parent signature if they leave).2. The classroom teacher, a crisis team member or other school-based mental health professionalwill inform students of the basic facts of the death from a prepared statement and stress theavailability of immediate and ongoing support as available in the school and community.Media 1. The school principal or designee should be the sole media spokesperson. Staff will refer allinquiries from the media directly to the spokesperson. The spokesperson will:a. Keep the district and school suicide prevention coordinators and superintendent informedof school actions related to the death.b. Prepare a statement for the media, including the facts of the death, postvention plans, andavailable resources. The statement will not include confidential information, speculationabout victim motivation, means of suicide, or personal family information (see After aToolkit, pp. 19-21).c. Answer all media inquiries. If a suicide is to be reported by news media, thespokesperson should encourage reporters to avoid the following: making it a front-pagestory, using pictures of the suicide victim, using the word suicide in the caption of thestory, describing the method of suicide, or using the phrase “suicide epidemic” as thismay elevate the risk of suicide contagion. They should also be encouraged not to linkbullying (or any other issue) to suicide and not to speculate about the reason for suicide.Media should be asked to offer the community information on suicide risk factors,warning signs, and resources available (see Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide).18 Appendix A Definitions At-risk A student who is defined as high risk for suicide is one who has made a previous suicide attempt, has the intent to die by suicide, or has displayed a significant change in behavior suggesting the onset or deterioration of a mental health condition. The student may have thought about suicide including potential means of death and may have a plan. In addition, the student may exhibit feelings of isolation, hopelessness, helplessness, and the inability to tolerate any more pain. This situation would necessitate a referral, as documented in the following procedures. *Another important risk factor to note is if a student has had a parent/guardian die bysuicide.Crisis team A multidisciplinary team comprised primarily of administrative, mental health, safety professionals, and support staff whose primary focus is to address crisis preparedness, intervention/response and recovery, including for suicide related situations. These professionals have been specifically trained in suicide intervention and crisis preparedness through recovery and take the leadership role in developing crisis plans, ensuring school staff can effectively execute various crisis protocols, and may provide mental health services for effective crisis interventions and recovery supports. Mental health A state of mental and emotional wellbeing that can impact choices, actions, and relationships that affect wellness. Mental health problems include mental and substance use disorders. Postvention Suicide postvention is a crisis intervention strategy designed to reduce the risk of suicide and suicide contagion, provide the support needed to help survivors cope with a suicide death, address the social stigma associated with suicide, and disseminate factual information after the suicide death of a member of the school community. Suicide Loss Survivor A survivor of suicide is a family member or friend of a person who died by suicide. Risk assessment An evaluation of a student who may be at risk for suicide, conducted by the appropriate school staff (e.g., school psychologist, school counselor, or school social worker). This assessment is designed to elicit information regarding the student’s intent to die by suicide, previous history of suicide attempts, presence of a suicide plan and its level of lethality and availability, presence of support systems, and level of hopelessness and helplessness, mental status, and other relevant risk factors. Risk factors for suicide Characteristics or conditions that increase the chance that a person may try to take his or her life. Suicide risk tends to be highest when someone has several risk factors at the same time. Risk factors may encompass biological, psychological, and or social factors in the individual, family, and environment. Self-harm Behavior that is self-directed and deliberately results in injury or the potential for injury to oneself. It can be categorized as either nonsuicidal self-injury or suicidal. Although self-harm often lacks suicidal intent, youth who engage in self-harm are more likely to attempt suicide. Suicidal ideation Thinking about, considering, or planning for self-injurious behavior which may result in death. A desire to be dead without a plan or intent to end one’s life is still considered suicidal ideation and should be taken seriously. Suicidal behavior These behaviors include suicide attempts, intentional injury to self, associated with at least some level of intent, developing a plan or strategy for suicide, writing a suicide note, gathering the means for a suicide plan, or any other overt action or thought indicating intent to end one’s life. 19 Suicide attempt A self-injurious behavior for which there is evidence that the person had at least some intent to kill himself or herself. A suicide attempt may result in death, injuries, or no injuries. A mixture of ambivalent feelings such as wish to die and desire to live is a common experience with most suicide attempts. Therefore, ambivalence is not a sign of a less serious or less dangerous suicide attempt. Suicide Death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of the behavior. Note: The coroner’s or medical examiner’s office must first confirm that the death was a suicide before any school official may state this as the cause of death. Parent acknowledgement that the death was a suicide is strongly recommended before discussing the death as a suicide with the students. School (and District-Level) Suicide Prevention Coordinator The district-level suicide prevention coordinator may be an existing staff member and is designated by the Superintendent with the responsibility of planning and coordinating implementation of this policy for the school district.  The school suicide prevention coordinator is appointed at the building level by the school principal to act as a point of contact in each school for issues relating to suicide prevention and policy implementation (including documentation). All staff members report students they believe to be at elevated risk for suicide to the school suicide prevention coordinator. In the absence of the school suicide prevention coordinator, the school counselor/school social worker/mental health professional or an administrator would be the designee.  *Although not required, this position is recommended.20 Appendix B Sample School Policy I. Policy StatementIt is the responsibility of the __________ School Corporation to provide a safe, supportive, andculturally responsive school environment for all students. The ______ School Board believes thatsuicide is a preventable public health problem and acknowledges that all students have the rightto be protected from those indicators that put students at higher risk for suicide. The board thusacknowledges the necessity of this policy to ensure school personnel are able to recognize andreport students at risk of suicide.II. Purposea. To protect the health and well-being of all _________ (insert school name) students.b. To establish procedures to prevent, assess the risk of, intervene, and respond to suicide risk instudents, staff, and volunteers and make referrals as needed.c.

Response ProceduresFirst responders/Staff: a. School personnel may ask some initial screening questions, if appropriate, or make a referralto the suicide prevention coordinator for initial screening and assessment (see Appendix H,What Can I Say?)i. Listen to the student with an open and non-judgmental stance; do not dismiss orundervalue what is being shared; be supportive and offer hope.ii. It is ok to ask the student if he/she has been thinking about suicide.b. Always take the threat of harm seriously.c. Take immediate action, which may include calling 911 and/or local law enforcement if thestudent is in imminent danger.d. Notify the School Suicide Prevention Coordinator so s/he can meet with the student andconduct a suicide risk assessment.e. The student should NOT be left unsupervised.f. Notify a school administrator regarding the potential risk.g. Document date, time, individuals involved, summary of conversation, etc. and share with theSuicide Prevention Coordinator.h. Following the referral, debrief with appropriate staff involved in the student’s referral process(avoid sharing details that may be considered privileged communication or unnecessarydetails that the student may wish to remain private).The following should be conducted by the School Suicide Prevention Coordinator ordesignee:i. Complete a Suicide Screening (if this hasn’t already taken place) and/or a SuicideAssessment to determine or confirm suspected suicide risk. (Schools should insert the nameof the screening and assessment tools used in the district).j. Communicate with the student about contacting parents. Include the student in thisconversation with the parent, when possible and appropriate.k. Contact the parent/guardian when there is risk of harm to inform of the situation and requestactive involvement in support of the student. The following should be addressed with theparent:i. seriousness of the situation;ii. do not assume the student is seeking attention;iii. a list of community mental health agencies/counselors;iv. information about when it is necessary to seek outside professional help;v. the need for ongoing and continuous monitoring at home;vi. increasing safety measures in the home, ensuring the home is free of potential safetyconcerns;vii. the desire and importance of working collaboratively with the student;viii. the need to follow a safety plan and update it as needed;ix. a request for a release of information form so communication between the school andoutside health provider can take place to best support the student;x. a request for the parent/guardian to stay in contact with the school and to be involvedat the re-entry meeting for the student (see Appendix O for parent information);xi. when appropriate, assist family with urgent referral and/or calling emergencyservices;xii. support for families who don’t speak or understand English, require an interpreter,etc. It’s important not to have the student or other family member translate.l. If reasonable attempts to reach the parent/guardian or adult in whose custody the student maybe released are not successful, the case will be treated as a medical emergency and23 arrangements will be made to contact appropriate medical services or local law enforcement. Documentation of all parties attempted to be reached will be made.  m. Failure on the part of the family to take seriously and provide for the safety of the studentmay be considered emotional neglect and reported to the Indiana Department of ChildServices.n. Develop a safety plan for the student. When possible, this should be developedcollaboratively with the student, parent, and any other individual(s) determined to beappropriate. The plan should be shared with school administration and other personnel whowill be involved in the implementation of the plan (see, Appendix L).o. Once imminent risk to harm oneself or others is shared, confidentiality is not maintained (nolonger considered privileged communication). Inform the School Administrator (who shouldcontact the District Suicide Prevention Coordinator) regarding the imminent risk (danger toself and others), risk level, recommendations, and safety plan.p. ALL actions and assessments must be documented. This should include screening andassessment results, behavioral observations; actions taken, including dates, times, individualsinvolved; a copy of the safety plan; phone calls; conversations; and follow-up actions. Thisdocumentation must be kept by the Suicide Prevention Coordinator in a secure file cabinet,separate from a student’s cumulative folder or academic file. It is critical to keep thisdocumentation separate, secure, and confidential.q. The school administrator and suicide prevention coordinator should be informed regardingfollow-up services, re-entry plan, and recommendations for the student to return to school.V. Reporting to State Authoritiesa. If after informing the parent of the situation, failure by the parent or the family to take seriously and provide safety for the student may be considered emotional neglect and may be reported to the Indiana Department of Child Services.b. If it is determined by school staff that contacting the parent or guardian would endanger the health or well-being of the student, parent contact may be delayed as appropriate, and DCS and/or local law enforcement should be notified immediately. The school should document reasons for which parents were not immediately notified and information that demonstrates the student’s health or well-being was assumed to be in danger. The school administrator or designee must stay at school with the student until the proper authorities arrive and assume responsibility for the child.VI. Support for Studentsa. School Counselor/Social Worker/Nurse have a current list of community-based mental health resources.b. School employees, including the suicide prevention coordinator or designee and teachers(s), will collaborate with the family and community resource(s) involved to prepare for re-entry and to continue to monitor the student’s safety plan and additional supports needed.c.

E., Boat, T., & Warner, K. E. (2009). Preventing mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders among young people: Progress and possibilities. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press; and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (2009). Risk and protective factors for mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders across the life cycle. Here are some key suicide risk factors:  A recent or serious loss, which might include the death of a family member, friend or pet. The separation or a divorce of parents, or abreakup with a boyfriend or girlfriend, can also be felt as a profound loss, along with a parent losing a job, or the family losing their home. A psychiatric disorder, particularly a mood disorder like depression and/or anxiety, or a trauma- and stress-related disorder. Prior suicide attempts increase risk for another suicide attempt. Alcohol and other substance use disorders, as well as getting into a lot of trouble, having disciplinary problems, engaging in a lot of high-risk behaviors. Struggling with sexual orientation in an environment that is not respectful or accepting of that orientation. The issue is not whether a childis gay or lesbian, but whether he or she is struggling to come out in an unsupportive environment. A family history of suicide is something that can be really significant and concerning, as is a history of domestic violence, child abuse orneglect. Lack of social support. A child who doesn’t feel support from significant adults in his/her life, as well as his/her friends, can become soisolated that suicide seems to present the only way out of problems. Community violence School violence Poverty Traumatic event School failure Low commitment to school Not college bound Aggression toward peers Associating with drug-using peers Societal/community norms favoralcohol and drug use Urban setting Poverty Associating with deviant peers Loss of close relationship or friendsSchool, Neighborhood, and Community  Presence of mentors and support fordevelopment of skills and interests Opportunities for engagement withinschool and community Positive norms Clear expectations for behavior Physical and psychological safety29  Bullying. We know that being a victim of bullying is a risk factor, but there’s also some evidence that kids who are bullies may be atincreased risk for suicidal behavior. Access to lethal means, like firearms and pills. Stigma associated with asking for help. The more hopeless and helpless people feel, if they feel a lot of guilt or shame or feel worthless orhave low self-esteem, the more likely they are to choose to hurt themselves or end their life. Barriers to accessing services: Difficulties in getting much-needed services include lack of access to counseling (both in school and out ofschool), bilingual service providers, unreliable transportation, and the financial cost of services. Cultural and religious beliefs that suicide is a noble way to resolve a personal dilemma.WARNING SIGNS Warning signs of suicide can be organized around the word “FACTS” Feelings  • Hopelessness: feeling like things are bad and won’t get any better• Fear of losing control, going crazy, harming himself/herself or others• Helplessness: a belief that there’s nothing that can be done to make life better• Worthlessness: feeling like an awful person and that people would be better off if he/she were dead• Hating himself/herself, feeling guilty or ashamed• Being extremely sad and lonely• Feeling anxious, worried, or angry all the timeActions • Drug or alcohol abuse• Talking or writing about death or destruction• Aggression: getting into fights or having arguments with other people• Recklessness: doing risky or dangerous thingsChanges • Personality: behaving like a different person, becoming withdrawn, tired all the time, not caring about anything, or becoming more talkative oroutgoing30 • Behavior: can’t concentrate on school or regular tasks• Sleeping pattern: sleeping all the time or not being able to sleep at all, or waking up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and notbeing able to get back to sleep• Eating habits: loss of appetite and/or overeating and gaining weight• Losing interest in friends, hobbies, and appearance or in activities or sports previously enjoyed• Sudden improvement after a period of being down or withdrawnThreats • Statements like “How long does it take to bleed to death?”• Threats like “I won’t be around much longer” or “Don’t tell anyone else . . . you won’t be my friend if you tell!”• Plans like giving away favorite things, studying about ways to die, obtaining a weapon or a stash of pills: the risk is very high if a person has aplan and the way to do it.• Suicide attempts like overdosing, wrist cuttingSituations • Getting into trouble at school, at home, or with the law• Recent loss through death, divorce, or separation; the breakup of a relationship; losing an opportunity or a dream; losing self-esteem• Changes in life that feel overwhelming• Being exposed to suicide or the death of a peer under any circumstancesAs referenced in the LifeLines Curriculum, (Hazelden, 2011). * The LifeLines program organizes the warning signs of suicide by use of the acronym FACTS, which stands for feelings, actions, changes,threats, and situations.31 Appendix E 32 Appendix F Appendix G 34 Appendix H 35 Appendix I Staff Documentation Form Student: School: Grade: Date: Staff Person Referring: Time of Day: Concern of student suicide was brought to my attention by:  Student self-report  Another student  Overheard students talking Student’s writing  Online posting/Social Media  Other ______________What other information did this student share that raised a concern about suicide risk? What steps did you take? What did the student share when asked about suicide? 36 **Important to Remember**  Remain calm. Ask the youth directly if he or she is thinking about suicide (e.g., \"Are you thinking of suicide?\"). Focus on your concern for their well-being and avoid being accusatory. Use your active listening skills—remember, the focus should be all on the student. Reassure them that there is help and they will not feel like this forever. Take a nonjudgmental and open stance to what the student is sharing, no matter howuncomfortable. The student has chosen you to share his/her painful story. Provide constant supervision. Never leave the youth alone. Get help: No one should ever agree to keep a youth's suicidal thoughts a secret and instead shouldtell an appropriate adult, such as a parent, school counselor/school social worker/mental healthprovider, administrator, teacher, or school psychologist. Parents should seek help from school orcommunity mental health resources as soon as possible. School staff should take the student to theSuicide Prevention Coordinator.Turn this form into the Suicide Prevention Coordinator, School Counselor, or Administrator (in person) IMMEDIATELY. Your notes will be extremely valuable when completing the student’s suicide risk assessment. Do not send this form via email or send it to the office with a student. A teacher may send notification via email or phone call that he/she has a documentation form related to suicide that needs to be delivered to the office but no identifying student information should be sent in the email. If immediate assistance is required, the office should be notified via a phone call, rather than email.    37 Appendix J Suicide Screening & Risk Assessment Tools Some professionals opt to utilize standardized screening tools for determining suicidal risk or level of depression rather than, or in addition to, a psychosocial interview.  Some tools which may be utilized by schools for this purpose include:  Suicide Risk Questionnaire Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ)Assessment Tools  Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale Lifetime-Recent SAMHSA SAFE-T risk assessment tool w/ Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale Recent38 39 Source: http://www.mhrsonline.org/media/spc_schools/Suicide%20Risk%20Questionnaire.pdf 40 Source: https://www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical-practice/Columbia_Suicide_Severity_Rating_Scale.pdf   41 Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire  The SIQ assesses the frequency of suicidal ideation and serves as a valuable component in a comprehensive assessment of adolescent mental health.   Serves as a starting point for gathering information about your client’s suicide potential   The SIQ consists of 30 items and is appropriate for students in Grades 10-12.   The SIQ-JR consists of 15 items and is designed for students in Grades 7-9.   Reliability coefficients are .97 for the SIQ and .93-.94 for the SIQ-JR.  For many adolescents, the SIQ and the SIQ-JR provide a mechanism for informing adults/professionals of their level of distress and suicidal intent, serving as a cry for help that doesn’t involve self-injurious behavior. Adolescents who are thinking about suicide may respond to these measures with the expectation that, in telling others of their suicidal thoughts, people will take notice of their distress and act to assist them. It is therefore vital that professionals act quickly once critical SIQ or SIQ-JR scores are obtained.

General thoughts of suicide WITHOUT a specific method or plan.    Refer to school counselor or other provider (if risk is detected outside of school).  Create a collaborative safety plan, notify involved staff and share plan.  Parents should be contacted and a plan should be made for follow up contact to determine how often check-ins and meetings will take place.  Counselor/suicide prevention coordinator checks in with student daily for first week, once a week for the next three weeks or as student/family deems appropriate.    MODERATE Endorses thoughts of suicide and has thought of at least one method to kill self but not a specific plan.  “I thought about taking an overdose but I never made a specific plan …and I would never go through with it.” Do not leave the student unsupervised.  Create a collaborative safety plan, notify involved staff and share plan. Parents should be contacted and plans made for them to come to the school.  Recommend parent/guardian make appointment with a mental health counselor. Determine if additional crisis response is necessary.     HIGH Active suicidal thoughts of killing oneself and reports having some intent to act on such thoughts.  Thoughts of killing oneself with details of plan fully or partially worked out and subject has some intent to carry it out. Do not leave the student unsupervised. Make plans to transport student to the emergency room or crisis department. Parents should be contacted and plans made for them to come to the school and assist with getting the student to a safe environment. If parents are unavailable, contact school resource officer or police for transport. If parent/guardian cannot be reached by the end of the day or parent/guardian refuses to pick up:   Contact Director of Safety/School Safety Specialist of [INSERT NAME of SCHOOLSAFETY HERE] at ______ or  Contact School Safety Officer, _______ at ______ or  [INSERT LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT HERE] for pick up and transport at xxx-xxx-xxxx or  *As a last option: Call CPS at 1-800-800-5556.  File a DCS report.  *A report should be filed on a case-by-case basis and only when deemed necessary based on Indiana Code, Chapter 5: Duty to Report Child Abuse or Neglect. All steps should be taken when possible to maintain a collaborative relationship with the student’s guardian in order to promote the well-being of the child.   49 Appendix L  Safety Planning Resources  Collaborative Safety Plan Template:   I, _________________________, developed this plan with my support system, specific to my needs.

Because families exposed to a suicide attempt or serious suicidal threat experience considerable guilt and fear.  They are more likely to disclose information if they know the school has a helpful, nonthreatening manner of dealing with suicide. Because a student who attempted/threatened suicide often is at greater risk for a suicide in the months following the crisis, it is extremely important to closely monitor his or her reentry into school and to maintain close contact with parents and mental health professionals working with that student. Assuming the student will be absent after a suicide attempt/serious threat and possibly hospitalized in a treatment facility, schools should follow these steps:   Obtain a written release of information for signed by the parents. This makes it possible for confidential information to be shared between school personnel and treatment providers.    Ask returning student/family if s/he has special requests about what is said/done by school.   Inform the student's teachers regarding the number of probable days of absence.  Instruct teachers to provide the students with assignments, if appropriate.   Once the student returns to school, designated crisis team member should maintain regular contact with the student.  If the student has a previous, positive relationship with a trusted staff member, provide support to that staff member in maintaining ongoing contact with the student.    Seek recommendations for aftercare from the student's therapist (if release form is in place). If the student has been hospitalized, Suicide Prevention Coordinator (or designee) should attend the discharge meeting at the hospital if available.   The Suicide Prevention Coordinator (or designee) should convey relevant non-confidential information to appropriate school staff regarding the aftercare plan.    The school should maintain contact with the parents to provide progress reports and other appropriate information and be kept informed of any changes in the safety plan.

Appendix Q   Procedures for Faculty Meeting following a Suicide 1. Distribute written statement of facts; dispel any rumors or misinformation.  2. Inform faculty of what action steps have been taken up to now; i.e., confirmation of facts, contact with family, notification of key personnel, crisis team meeting, funeral arrangements, etc.  3. Announce administrator, suicide prevention coordinator, and crisis team roles and contact persons for responding to outside requests for information from police, media, parents etc.  4. Allow staff to react, ask questions and express feelings. Staff should be encouraged to discuss feelings; point out that understanding their own feelings will make it easier for them to deal with student feelings.  5. Share support services for staff as well as students’; review who will be available, when and where.  6. Review plan to inform students and guidelines; provide time for staff to ask questions or express concern. Emphasize availability of crisis team members to assist and support staff who are uncomfortable leading class discussion.  7. Discuss need to monitor possible and known “at risk” and “high risk” students more carefully. Review staff responsibilities and steps if they suspect a student is at risk of suicide or would needs further assessment.  8. Review plan for school day and for after-school hours. 9. In subsequent faculty meetings:  1. a. support staff and encourage discussion of their feelings b. identify any problems that have arisen and problem-solve c. identify “at risk” and “high risk” students; develop a plan for monitoring and supporting them d. remind and discuss the importance of continued support of both students and staff and provide mental health resources     Appendix R  Procedures for Talking to Students about Suicide Death 1. Prepare students for the serious and tragic nature of the information you are about to share with them. Say that it is expected this news will upset many of them and that both you and other staff are there to help them get through this.  2. Announce the facts of the situation and what actions are being taken as a result (i.e. all classes are being informed, counseling centers are being set up, etc.).  3. Allow students to react; pay special attention to the following:  a. Dispel any rumors or unconfirmed information.  b. Stress that we each react differently to tragedies and must respect one another’s feelings and ways of reacting.  c. Point out that grief, sadness, anger, guilt, fear and disbelief are all normal reactions to such news. Grief is unique to each person and there is no one way to grieve. 4. Convey a sense of acceptance for all the feelings expressed, avoid judgmental or value statements about anyone’s feelings.  5. Note that some people’s feelings will be stronger than others and that individual help is available.  6. If student’s reactions seem particularly intense or you feel unable to respond to them adequately, strongly encourage them to seek assistance from one of the designated counseling centers. Offer to accompany them to the designated counseling area and/or ask a member of the crisis team to accompany them (as they should not be alone).  7. If students have questions you are unable to answer or if you are feeling uncomfortable in the discussion, seek out a member of the crisis team to assist you.  8. Encourage students to be supportive of one another but stress the importance of seeking help or encouraging their friends to seek help from adults if their feelings seem more intense or persistent than “normal”.  9. Reassure students that they are not responsible for what happened - discourage guilt and unrealistic “hindsight regrets”. Instead, focus discussion on how they might use what they now know to avoid similar tragedies in the future.  10. In cases of suicide, avoid focusing on the details or circumstances that led up to the person’s death; stress the reasons that someone dies by suicide are not simple, and are related to mental disorders that get in the way of the person thinking clearly Blaming others—or blaming the person who died—does not acknowledge the reality that the person was battling a mental disorder. 11. Allow students who do not want to participate in the discussion to study quietly in the room or seek assistance from one of the counseling centers. Don’t assume that the lack of a visible reaction means the student has no reaction.  12. Allow as much time as students seem to need for the discussion. Try to move discussion toward how students can help one another and encourage help-seeking behaviors.  13. Students who wish to memorialize the dead person in some way should be referred to a crisis team member.  14. End the class by reminding students of the counseling and support services that are available.    Appendix S  Why is Grief Following Suicide Different?   The grief is more intense and often never fully resolved  The bereaved are more likely to become socially isolated and withdrawn because of the stigma that still surrounds suicide death  The bereaved engage in a continuous search for the reason and are likely to assume greater responsibility for the death  The bereaved experience significant guilt associated with not anticipating or preventing the suicide.  How might students present with grief?  Children - heightened insecurities (e.g. fearful, clingy, tearful) and regressive behaviors (i.e., changes in eating, sleeping and toileting patterns).   Young People - increased risk-taking behaviors (i.e., use of alcohol / drugs, sexual activity, use of cars / motorbikes in unsafe ways), withdrawal from friends and family, sudden loss of interest and/or poor school performance, engaging in 'attention-seeking' behaviors.

Ways of Supporting a Bereaved Child or Young Person  Don't put a time limit on the process of grieving. Be available some time down the track  Sit quietly with the young person and listen while he/she talks, cries or is silent  Make opportunities to share memories or look at photos of the person who has died  Acknowledge and believe the young person's pain and distress whatever the loss - large or small  Reassure the person that grief is a normal response to loss and there is no wrong or right way to grieve  Don't panic in the absence or presence of strong emotional responses  Provide a safe space; have a regular routine  Be consistent, honest and reassuring  Give honest, adequate and appropriate information  Include and involve the child in appropriate decision-making and in what is happening  Acknowledge feelings and give support when the child is overwhelmed by feelings  Provide opportunities to remember, create a memory box and make a memory book, draw, paint, make a collage, write stories, poems, collect photos  Be aware of the effect of special occasions and assist in preparation for them. E.g. Mother's Day, Father's Day, Christmas, Easter, holidays  Be aware of your own grief and/or feeling of helplessness  Provide information about grief--- books, web sites     Appendix T General Communication Resources  When the death has been ruled a suicide   It is with great sadness that I have to tell you that one of our students, _________, has died by suicide.  All of us want you to know that we are here to help you in any way we can.  A suicide death presents us with many questions that we may not be able to answer right away. Rumors may begin to circulate, and we ask that you not spread rumors you may hear. We’ll do our best to give you accurate information as it becomes known to us. Suicide is a very complicated act. It is usually caused by a mental disorder such as depression, which can prevent a person from thinking clearly about his or her problems and how to solve them. Sometimes these disorders are not identified or noticed; in other cases, a person with a disorder will show obvious symptoms or signs. One thing is certain: there are treatments that can help. Suicide should never, ever be an option.  Each of us will react to _____’s death in our own way, and we need to be respectful of each other. Feeling sad is a normal response to any loss. Some of you may not have known ______very well and may not be as affected, while others may experience a great deal of sadness. Some of you may find you’re having difficulty concentrating on your schoolwork, and others may find that diving into your work is a good distraction.  We have counselors available to help our school community deal with this sad loss and to enable us to understand more about suicide. If you’d like to talk to a counselor, just let your teachers know.  Please remember that we are all here for you.

Facts about Suicide and Mental Disorders in Adolescents (After a Suicide: A Toolkit for Schools) Suicide is not inexplicable and is not simply the result of stress or difficult life circumstances. The key suicide risk factor is an undiagnosed, untreated, or ineffectively treated mental disorder. Research shows that over 90 percent of people who die by suicide have a mental disorder at the time of their death.  In teens, the mental disorders most closely linked to suicide risk are major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, substance use disorder, and eating disorders. While in some cases these disorders may be precipitated by environmental stressors, they can also occur as a result of changes in brain chemistry, even in the absence of an identifiable or obvious “reason.”  Suicide is almost always complicated. In addition to the underlying disorders listed above, suicide risk can be affected by personality factors such as impulsivity, aggression, and hopelessness. Moreover, suicide risk can also be exacerbated by stressful life circumstances such as a history of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse; death, divorce, or other trauma in the family; persistent serious family conflict; traumatic breakups of romantic relationships; trouble with the law; school failures and other major disappointments; and bullying, harassment, or victimization by peers.  It is important to remember that the vast majority of teens who experience even very stressful life events do not become suicidal. In some cases, such experiences can be a catalyst for suicidal behavior in teens who are already struggling with depression or other mental health problems. In others, traumatic experiences (such as prolonged bullying) can precipitate depression, anxiety, abuse of alcohol or drugs, or another mental disorder, which can increase suicide risk. Conversely, existing mental disorders may also lead to stressful life experiences such as family conflict, social isolation, relationship breakups, or school failures, which may exacerbate the underlying illness and in turn increase suicide risk.      Messaging Matters: The Messaging “Don’ts” The following are practices to avoid in public communications because they can be (1) Unsafe, by increasing risk for vulnerable individuals; or (2) Unhelpful, by reinforcing problematic norms, conveying negative stereotypes or otherwise undermining prevention.  Don’t show or describe suicide methods or locations. Pictures or detailed descriptions of how or where a person died by suicide can encourage imitation or serve as a “how-to” guide.  Don’t include personal details of people who have died by suicide. Vulnerable individuals may identify with the personal or situational details of someone who died by suicide, encouraging them to end their own lives.  Don’t glorify or romanticize suicide. Portraying suicide as a heroic, romantic, or honorable act may encourage vulnerable people to view it more positively or lead them to desire the positive attention garnered by someone who has died by suicide.  Don’t normalize suicidal behavior by presenting it as common or acceptable. While we don’t want to minimize the magnitude of the suicide problem, we also don’t want to imply that suicidal behavior is acceptable, normal, or what most people do in a given circumstance. The vast majority of people who face adversity, mental illness, and other challenges—even those in high risk groups—do not die by suicide, but instead find support, treatment, or other ways to cope.  Don’t use data or language that suggests suicide is inevitable or unsolvable. o Describing suicide as an “epidemic,” using terms like “bullycide,” or providing extensive statistics about suicide without solutions or action steps are examples of messaging that can make suicide seem too overwhelming to address. These practices also contribute to normalizing suicide (described above) and add to an overall negative narrative about suicide by implying that nothing can be done about it.  Don’t oversimplify causes.  Suicides result from a complex interplay of factors. Therefore: o Avoid attributing suicide to a single cause or circumstance (e.g., job loss, break-up, bullying, high stress, or being a military veteran, gay youth, or Native American). Presenting suicide as an understandable or inevitable response to a difficult situation or membership in a group can create a harmful “social script” that discourages other ways of coping. o Avoid portraying suicide as having no cause. Describing suicidal behavior as the inexplicable act of an otherwise healthy or high-achieving person may encourage identification with the person who died and convey that suicide can’t be prevented. It’s also a missed opportunity to educate the public about warning signs and how to respond to them.  Don’t reinforce negative stereotypes, myths, or stigma related to mental illnesses or suicidal persons, as this may shift beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors in the wrong direction. Examples: o Messages linking particular groups with high rates of suicide or mental illness, especially without examples of effective interventions or stories of recovery, may inadvertently increase negative beliefs or discriminatory behaviors towards that group. o Messaging themes such as “breaking the stigma of mental illness” or other language that reiterates the extent to which stigma is a problem may serve to reinforce stigma, rather than countering it. o Adjectives like “successful” suicide, “unsuccessful” suicide,” and “failed attempt” inappropriately define a suicide death as a success and a nonfatal attempt as a failure. Terms such as “committed suicide” (associated with crimes), can reinforce stigmatizing attitudes about people who die by suicide.
