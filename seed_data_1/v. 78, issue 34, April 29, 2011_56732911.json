It marks admission into an elite, highly motivated, and successful group of students. It also marks the opportunity to net­work with top ranked profes­sionals and to push oneself both inside and outside the classroom. Honors programs exist at universities all over the coun­try. Bryant's, however, tend to stand out above most. Gradu­ating with honors distinction here at Bryant involves meet­ing many criteria, including taking seven honors classes and completing the infamous capstone project. Last year, however, 29 percent of the original members of the Class of 2010 who started in the program graduated with hon­ors. Though that number may seem low at fi rs t glance, na­tionally t e average gradua­tion rate of honors students is only 15 percent. At national honors confer­ences, people don't under­stand how Bryant, a small, predominantly business school, is graduating so many honors students. Honors pro­grams started out many years ago in liberal arts schools and to this day are most popular in schools focused on liberal arts and sciences. Honors pro­grams have not traditionally been popular in business schools because intense re­search isn't necessarily per­ceived to be important to business students. Bryant Honors Program coordinator Dr. Ken Sousa, however, be­lieves the program at Bryant is immeasurably invaluable to business students. It provides a forum for learning the busi­ness trade in a way that is less formal and codified than peo­ple perceive. Also, the oppor­tunity for lifelong learning is something that is important See uHonors program\", page 2. Smithfield, RI April 29, 20I I Hall 16 RAs raise awareness for GLBT issues By Jessica Komoroski Editor-in-Chief Since 2008, in November of each year, the Office of Residence Life hosts a com­petition amongst the Resi­dent Assistants (RAs) titled \"Res Life's Big Give.\" The competition is focused on philanthropy and was cre­ated to encourage commu­nity service programming among RAs and their indi­vidual staffs. Res Life tries to encour­age the entire RA staff to en­gage in larger scale philanthropic activities. As­sistant Director of Residence Life, Kristin Biggins, ex­plains, \"Philanthropy has al­ways been an important part of the Res Life program.\" In the past, during their winter training, the entire staff of over 60 RAs would go on a day-long community service trip. However, Biggins ex­plains that the unpredictable w inter eather and the large group made it diffirult for service sites to be accommo­dating. In order to encourage the same scope of community service, the Big Give pro­vides each of the seven RA staffs with\"a fictional $250 with which to de­velop a proposal to benefit a charity or organization of their choice.\" Biggins con­tinues, \"The staffs present their propos­als to a panel of cam­pus'celebrity' guest judges\" who are called upon to decide which staff was most successful in convinc­ing them that thell proposal is important and relevant to the Bryant community. The winning staff is then given the ac­tual $250 to imple­Bryant CHANGE group at work on-site in Providence.

Imagine being settled into a horne with a family you love, a job that supports that family, and a supply of food that nour­ishes them. Now, imagine a civil war or a government takeover starting in your country. You spend y our days in fear of armed men barging in your house and uprooting your life, or of being killed because of your beliefs. You are lucky enough to find refuge in the United States, but you don't know anyone; besides a roof over your head, you have no access to any other necessities, such as food, educa­tion, and health care. This is what many African refugees experience in corning to the U.S. The African Alliance of Rhode Island (AARl) seeks to ease African refugees' transition to America through vari­ous initiatives that provide a community and many of the necessities they lack. Their community gardens initiative is meant to help with several aspects of acclimation. Food is grown to ensure that the refugees are receiving proper nutrition, but it is also sold for a small profit to help the refugees send their children to local schools in Providence.

The first graduate from then Bryant College's Honors Program graduated in December of 2001. His name is Jason Colgan and he completed his capstone project under the guidance of none other than Ken Sousa. In the ten years since then, Colgan has gone on to be­come a very successful businessman. He is the owner of Safer Start Child University, a \"university\" for young children. Colgan's idea is to start the educa­tion process at a time when most chil­dren are just playing games in daycare. His \"universities\" are run by education professionals so children can begin the learning process early on. His was the first daycare facility in the United States to be equipped with webcams, so parents can see their children from their desks at work. On May 3, Colgan will be back at Bryant. This time, he will be giving the keynote address at the Honors Pro­gram banquet, celebrating a decade of academic excellence. The banquet marks the celebration of the program's 151 graduates over the past ten years. This year's graduates will be honored at the banquet and will have the op­portunity to network with alumni, fac­ulty, and their peers. Awards for the best capstone projects will also be given out. When Sousa took over this program five years ago, he was the third coordi­nator that the Class of 2007 had had in three years. In the program's first five years, it had only graduated 34 stu­dents. Sousa took over the position with the task of revamping it. His first move as coordinator was to drop 55 juniors from the program because of THE BRYANT MBA ONE-YEAR PROGRAM FilII-lime, day program for all majors • \t No professional experience necessary • \t Distinguish yourself in a competitive job market • \t Gain hands-on experience with the Business Practicum THE BRYANT MBA TwO-YEAR PROGRAM Part-tim e, evening program for professionals from any field • \t Develop high-level business skills for long-term career success • Enter and progress through the program with a supportive team • \t Build your network while enhancing your resume their lack of honors classes. At that pOint, it became clear that this program was something that Sousa was going to fully dedicate himself to. I would venture to say he has been successful. In the five years since he took over, he has guided 117 people to graduate from the program. He has created an environment for students who believe academic excellence is im­portant-a place where those students don't need to be ashamed to be schol­ars but can instead have their efforts admired and encouraged. In Sousa's own words, when he took over, he thought he was taking over a program of geeks. He has in­stead found them to be, \"the most kind hearted, sincere people on this campus, who believe in excellence in them­selves and in their community.\" The Honors Program has allowed its stu­dents to stop feeling ashamed for chal­lenging and stretching themselves. Students who make it through the first two years of the program begin preparing their capstone projects in their junior year. Bryant's program is one of the few in the country that al­lows students to complete their cap­stone outside of their major. Sousa feels this is beneficial to students be­cause it allows them to pick a topic in a discipline they are passionate about. In fact, at Bryant, about fifty percent of Honors students complete their cap­stone outside of their major. Specifi­cally, one half of the business students complete projects in areas of the Col­lege of Arts and Sciences. The capstone project gives students the chance to learn how to manage an unbounded project, to manage their time and themselves. These are skills that are imperative regardless of the THE BRYANT MASTER OF PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTANCY (MPAc) FilII- lime, day program for accoullting majors • \t Meets the 150 hour requirement for CPA licensure • \t Complete in Summer/ Fall, Summer/Summer, Fall/Spring, or Spring/Summer • \t Tax concentration available with Summer/Fall or SummerJSummer plan THE B YANT MASTER OF SCIENCE IN TAXATION (MST) Part-tim(', even ing program for tax professio nals • \t Build an expertise in all areas of taxation • \t Network with tax executives and industry professionals • \t Flexible scheduling options THE BRYANT GRADUATE PROGRAMS The Bryant University Graduate School of Business prepares students for success in their chosen professions.

Stu­dents who finish the program, Sousa says, are the ones who want something different and realize how beneficial the process will be to them. \"The kids who finish our program earn self esteem, they aren't given it\" The success of the program in the last five years, Sousa credits to the partnership he has found in the depart­ment of Academic Affairs, Sousa com­plements Dr V.K Unni for his focus on transforming the Honors Program into a flagship program for Academic Af­fairs. Current VPAA Dr. Griffiths is carrying that torch and that is exempli­fied in Academic Affairs' new goal to have the Honors Program both inter­nally and externally reviewed next year. So next time you think of an Honors student, Sousa hopes you think of more than just a \"dweeb with a pocket protector.\" These students are some of the most focused, goal oriented, and competitive people on campus. The majority are actively involved in at least one club or organization on cam­pus in addition to holding a job. The program this year hosted 38 different academic, social, cultural, and profes­sional events for its members. To quote its brochure, \"The Honors Program at Bryant University provides its members with experiences that dif­ferentiate them for other college gradu­ates and creates a trajectory for continued success,\" Sousa sums up the program by say­ing, \"As graduates reflect on their four years as members of the Honors Pro­gram at Bryant University, they consis­tently describe the experience as rewarding, fu lfilling. and enriching They also note that they achieved more than they ever thought possible.\" Survivor Series: Mike Banville I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma at age 12. At first I really wasn't sure what to expect; I had never really heard of cancer, but I was still a little worried. I did not know of a past history of cancer so tha t made my diagnosis much more of a surprise. My biggest chal­lenge in going through cancer would have to be myself. It was a physically and emotionally dif­ficult time for me and every day was a challenge. What I enjoy most about life now is the ability to take all of my past hardships and use them as fuel in order to help out oth­ers. Cancer has given me new in­sights into life that not a lot of people can experience. From my disease I have gained a lot of inner strength and the will to go on regardless of any hardship. The diagnosis of cancer was hard on me, but I know that it must have also been very tough particularly on my family. My mom was always there for me and took me to every single one of my chemotherapy treatments. My dad took time off of work and picked me up after school for my radiation treatment, which was also in Boston, Some of my hobbies include soccer, basketball, tennis, camping, video games, hanging out with friends, and doing community service. My family and friends were always there for me, and I am glad that they were th re when I needed them.

Addition­ally, the staff feels a strong emotional support for the mission of YPI be­cause there are 3 openly gay RAs on their staff of 8, She hopes this event will show them how much the Bryant community appreciates the advocacy of YPI on behalf of this underrepre­sented demographic. The dinner reception will join the Hall 16 staff with staff members from YPI, LGBTQ high school teens from the Providence area, and allies from the Bryant community. The event will include a speech from Steven Al­ibrandi, '11, who will talk with these teens about his experience at Bryant as an openly gay student and leader. The keynote speech will be delivered by former Dean of the School of Busi­ness at Bryant University, Jack Trifts. Moholland explains that Trifts is an incredible ally to and friend of the LGBTQ community. Beyond these speeches, the Hall 16 staff will also be presenting YPI with an appreciation award for the work that they do and presenting the Bryant Community with the first an­nual \"Rainbow Awards,\" These awards are given to one student, fac­ulty member r administrator, and campus organization that provide great support to the LGBTQ commu­nity. Nominations were collected from administrative departments throughout the university, Moholland said the Hall 16 staff is hoping to show the teens from the Providence area that Bryant is an ac­cepting community for those who identify as gay, and that there is hope to be comfortable with your sexuality once you enter the college abnos­phere. In explaining why a program like this is important for the Bryant community, Moholland said \"we are hoping that this event can be carried on as a tradition for years to come as we found there really isn't any event on campus that recognizes and sup­ports this community like we are hoping to do.\" She believes that Bryant has made great strides to be supportive of the gay community and hopes this event will help recognize and advance the efforts of the university to make Bryant an accepting and supportive institution. Poche continued on this point; \"organizations such as Bryant Pride and the LGBTQ and Allies Faculty/Staff Caucus are working fiercely to make Bryant a more open and accepting community.. .it is es­sential for univerSIty departments and organizations to collaborate with community organizations such as YPI in order to build a strong and vocal community of advocates that extends beyond the scope of the cam­pus gates.\" He said that the Department of Residence Life recognizes the need to provide a safe environment felT all students, and through their tTalIUng and philanthropy the RA staff hdS re· mained a strong force in the fi t or LGBTQ equality.

The Greeks had their annual Greek Week competitions, Greek Banquet, Spring Party, and St. Jude's Up 'Til Dawn. Greek Week is a week in which the different chapters compete in a vari­ety of activities ranging from the Nugget Bowl to the Brain Bowl. This year's Greek Week was definitely a competitive and exciting one! Greek Life would like to congratulate the brothers of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and the sisters of the Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority for winning Greek Week. At the conclusion of Greek Week, the Greeks held their annual Greek Ban­quet, in which they recognize specific chapters and members for their accom­plishments throughout the year. Also, Greek Life would like to congratulate all the members and chapters who won awards. For a list of the award winners, please feel free to go to the Greek Life page on the Bryant website. The Greeks also held their annual Spring Party, which is a party designed for Bryant faculty and staff members and their children. The children seemed to have a great time as they were enter­tained by a magician, face painter, bal­loon animal artist, and an Easter egg hunt. The attendance for the event was pheno'menal with over seventy-five fac­ulty, staff, and children there. St. Jude'S Up 'Til Dawn was also very successful this year. The commit­tee will be revealing the total figures on Friday, April 29. Lastly, Greek Life would life to wish everyone best of luck on their finals and a relaxing summer! Continued from page one The refugees grow vegetables and other plants native to both Africa and the U.s. As part of the Leadership D velopment Program's CHANGE institute this semester, 13 Bryant students traveled to Providence on a Saturday morning in April to as­sist in preparing the gardens for planting. Tasks included turning over garden beds, building new beds, and adding compost and soil to all of the beds. Wh en a ed about the commu­nity garden initiative, Julius, the director of AARI, replie that the gardens are a place for refugees to avoid isolation, a major issue when coming to the United States. Peo­ple are able to come together and work in any part of the garden they enjoy. They may even start singing a song while working. Be­sides gardening, AARI teaches the refugees English and works as an advocate in African countries where there is social unrest. The 12 CHANGE students, along with the spring Institute Co­ordinator Makena Sage, enjoyed helping refugees prepare their gar­den for planting. The students worked with refugees from several different countries, such as Bu­rundi and Liberia. Below are re­flections from some of the students that attended: Cassandra Bopp, CHANGE Graduate While working with the African Al­liance I was able to push myself to do things I normally wouldn't attempt, without any hesuaho'l. in just a few hours I was able to see the garden come Bryant CHAN GE to life. It was amazing to see such a di­verse group of people able to work to­gether ificielltly in orda to aLcomplish so much in such a short amount oftime. The members of the African Alliance were extremely wel­comillg, and despite language and cul­tural barriers, we were able to have fim and get to know each other. I would recommend the African Alliance to QI/yone who IS looking to help out and get their hands dirty. James King. CHANGE Graduate I enjoyed helpillg out the African Alliallce. I laue learning about other cultures. It was interesting to meet with Africml refuge living in Provi­dence. They are not /1 group that I've come into contact with before. III tileir garden they grow African vegetables which no doubt provide a taste of home. Food takes us back to where we have been. McDonald's may be my 6th birthday party, but having ceviche is my study abroad experience in Costa Rica. I have learned much in a few hours and hope to continue learn­ing. As a CHANGE participant my­self, I echo the previous testi­monies. It was truly astounding to see the before and after. What began as a pile of wood, a pack of shovels, and a mound of soil turned into a garden ready for planting. While I was physically sore from shoveling and carrying soil, I was proud of what I had done to help people who face hard­ships every day. Before I complain about a paper I have to write or an exam I have to study for, I will first recognize how lucky I am to not have to worry about shelter, food, or health care. The Bryant Linked Through Leadership Program de\\'elops its students by enhancing their indi­vidual, group and community leadership abilities. Programs in­clude three 7-week institute.: LEARN (leadership at the individ­uallevel), LEAD (leadership at the group level), and CHANGE (lead­ership at the community/society level) that run every semester as well as annual retreats that coin­cide with each of these levels. In addition to running the an­nual BRIDGES Community Service Retreat, every institute includes a community service component. Utilizing the Social Change Model, the Linked Through Leadership Program prepares students for suc­cess in personal and professional endeavors. The program was de­veloped by Richard Hurley and the 2007-2011 Student Leadership Councils. The Council is a group of 10 stu­dents who are selected to serve from the spring of their junior year through the fall of their senior year, and assist in all aspects of planning and running the insti­tutes and retreats.

This field training exercise was in anticipation 2012 Cadets at Field Training Exercise Day (Courtesy of Fira Zainal) Fira Zainal Staff Writer Not many students can say that they've been on a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter, but if you're in the Reserve Officers Training Corps program you probably have been on one many times. Just ask Cadet Patrick Shea '12 who has rid­den on the Blackhawk heli­copter many times as well as practiced at the rifle range. Did I mention that he does for their upcoming Leader­ship Development Assess­ment Camp (LDAC) at Fort Lewis, Washington this sum­mer. At the camp, they will be evaluated and assessed on everything they've learned through the ROTC program, from their ability to react quickly to a situation to their leadership skills. The cadets are understand­ably excited for their training this summer. When asked about what the summer will entail, Cadet Patrick Shea '12 said, \"My­self, along with the other cadets in the 'unior class, will be going to Fort Lewis, WA for a month to the LDAC training where we will meet with other ROTC juniors from across the na­tion. After LDAC, I am going to Fort Jackson, SC where I will be working with a basic training un it. I am not ex­actly sure w h at I will be doing, but it will ertainly be a great experience. It will be another opportunity for me to learn more about the Army environment that I will experience when I grad­uate.\" Cadet Kenneth Rayner '12 also has similar plans after Fort Lewis. He elaborated, \"After the LDAQC, I will be going to Air Assault School, where I will learn how to rap­pel from helicopters. This course is an extremely physi­cally challenging course.\" The Field Training at Big River was a demonstration in how extremely involved and motivated the cadets were for ROTC \"I've been in ROTC since my freshman year so I'm com­ing to the end of my third year as a Cadet now,\" said Cadet Kyle Ribeiro '12. \"My experience in ROTC has been rewarding, challenging, and fun at the same time. I've al­ways wanted to be an officer in the military, and my ROTC battalion has given me oppor­tuni ties which I would not have received if I had chosen any other commissioning path. My ROTC classmates have become some of my best friends, and I h ave full confi­dence that every one of my thirteen fellow MSIII (junior) Cadets will be a quality sec­ond lieutenant. \" Not all ROTC cadets start off the program in their fresh­man year. Cadet Brendan Heller '12 says, \"When I carne back for my sophomore year, I contacted the ROTC depart­ment and told them I was in­terested in the program. I was able to do that in addition to swimming and a full load of classes. I started ROTC in my sophomore year because I felt I had more to give in life\". The demanding workload did not deter Cadet Heller. He says, \"It was very demanding and taught me the importance of time management in order to be able to get everything done I needed to, but it also gave me a great sense of ac­complishment.\" The ROTC program at Providence College was rec­ognized in 1996 as one ofthe top programs in the New England and New York area. As of December 2007, 1790 of­ficers have been commIS­sioned through the Providence ColI ge Program. F r m ore information, please visit http://www.goarmy.com/rotc. html.

Seeing student-athletes succeed on the playing fields - earning all-conference hon­ors, leading their teams to vic­tories, watching them receive the praise and notoriety that goes along with their on-field triumphs - that's all \"That's when I know we are doing things the right way.\" Coming to Bryant in 2007 after earning her bachelor's degree from UMass and a master's degree from Spring­field College, Tiarks has done an incredible job at conquer­ing an often overwhelming task: working with more than 450 students-athletes through­out the year on what's impor­tant off the field. A former collegiate athlete herself, Tiarks understands the rigors and demands of being a Division I student-Joined by the talents of Marissa Zadrozny and Aaron Dashiell, Tiarks offers guidance and support for those who need it. \"Through the Aca­demic Center for Ex­cellence, we have taken it upon our­selves to get freshmen immediately con­nected to the best re­sources we can offer, allowing them to start off their academic ca­reers on the right foot,\" said Tiarks. \"All freshmen are required to attend eight hours of study hall every week, but that can include time they spend utilizing the im'..,.......,,.... the resources and demic as well as athletic success to its players.

That is what it's all about,\" said Tiarks. athlete. Balancing studies and group projects with team practices, game travel and off­season workouts requires commitment, focus and, most importantly, discipline.

The combined student-athlete grade point average reached its highest level ever this past fall at 2.908, just a fraction below the undergraduate stu­dent-body CPA of 2.983. A total of 233 athletes ex­ceeded the CPA of the overall student population, with 229 of them earning at least a 3.0.

Seventy-one were named academic all­conference selections by the Northeast Conference, with nine earning Gold Scholar recognition. \"Every semester we seem to have a breakthrough year that's even better than the last one,\" said Tiarks. \"The stu­dent-athlete CPA just contin­ues to climb higher and higher, and that is certainly a direct result of the resources and programming offered here at Bryant University through the Academic Center for Excellence.\" Bryant University Intramural Athlete of the Week: SpringMVP Award Todd Stewart r m all of us here at Archw~y Sports we th y u r your reader hip!

I'm sad to say that Bryant Pride' s ef­forts were ruined by people on Bryant's campus tearing down posters before and after the event, as well as walking by the table while using ho­mophobic language, saying things such as \"One woman, one man. Where are all the Christian values nowadays?\" I was deeply offended by this as a member of Bryant Pride, a bisexual student, a Christian, and a member of this community. It's also un­fortunate that some of these same incidents happened last year on the Day of Silence. It's ironic on the day that stu­dents on campus are trying to break the silence, certain peo­ple on campus are trying their best to silence those same supportive students. There are several injustices happening on campus right now, as I write, and probably dents at Bryan not treated fa· rly hun lur being ai on­versation too. First~y, there is no GLBT center on campus. There's a Woman's Center, an Interfaith Center, and an ICC, but Bryant s m how hasn't got­ten around to giving an active part of Bryant's campus a place where they can go and feel safe .

There's also the fact that there's no gender-neutral hou sing. There are over 50 schools in the United States that offer gender neutral housing and countless schools abroad. Six out of the eight Ivy League schools already have gender neutral housing, and Rutgers University is one of the most recent schools to pass tms, shortly after the sui­cide of Tyler Clementi.

Besides, there are 17 Halls and dozens of townhouses; the school has more than enough space to create a gen­der-neutral floor, townhouse, or even an entire hall, if that's what students want.

This hrings their number to eleven, which is not enough to meet quo­rum. Since the publication of my last piece about quorum, I wanted to clarify some of this murkiness. Some students think that quorum is simply two thirds of the elected Student Sena­tors that happen to be there, and if this were the case, tech­nically they could have just ONE senator in ONE seat, and that would meet quorum. Quorum, as defined in the Senate Constitution is: \"Two­thirds (2/3) of the Legislative Body shall constitute a quo-our democratic representation as a student body is threat­ened. Last week here on The Sen­ate Axiom, I touched ,gn the fact that Student Senate's leg­islative body has eleven sena­tors out of a possible fifteen, but one aspect I didn't touch on, was why. Why there are so many empty seats, is the focus of this week's column. So why do these seats remain open? What discourages stu­dents from running? Theories for this absence range from the cyclical to the more se­vere. Some students feel that is receiving more representation than others, then debate may sway in favor of those classes with full representation, leaving the classes with fewer repre­sentatives to have fewer votes on legislation, and this in it­self is simply unfair to the mi­nority classes. This balancing of represen­tation is critical to functioning of the Senate, and it will be in­teresting to see how the exec­utive board deals with these absences and their debilitat­ing nature, as this effort should be paramount to deal­ing with any other situations.

While the attempted ir ny works in some parts (a particular scene involviI g the masked killer playing\"director\" of his own horror movi comes to mind), it falls Hat 10 others. The actors in the film re­ally don't matter much to the movie. Rory Culkin, Alison Brie, Marley Shelton, and Adam Brody all round out the recogrUzable cast, but none of them steal the show. While it's a joy to see Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette back on screen together again (\"you were my 90's!!\" one high cho 1 nerd squ als at Cox's feisty investigativ journalis l ale), Cox and Arqu tte are really given nothing to do in the film.

However, the real problem with Scream 4 is thal it doe not find a way to balance its humor with adequate sc res.

Indeed, while the movie entertains, it's still a very unnecessary sequel that feels like a sub-par re­tread of the superior original. While Scream 2 was also superb, Scream 4 is now showing just how tired the franchise is.

This is the first year-end review of all the environmentally sustainable proj­ects on Bryant University's campus. The SIFE Green Team hopes to publish this report at the end of each academic year. Most of the Bryant Commu­nity is unaware of just how green our University is. We hope this Green Annual Report will bring attention to all that has already been done and spark an interest in some of the future projects planned. The Green Team: Our initiatives include: participation in Recyclemania, Weigh the Waste event in partnership with Greek Life, planning campus clean ups with our Green Team Ambassadors, and working with Special Initiatives to purchase new recycling bins for the entire campus. Recycling Initiative: Green Team worked to create a proposal which they presented to the Special Initiative Committee to fund the $40,000 to pur­chase recycling bins. Paul Cinq-Mars: the Manager of Custodial Operations in charge of making the campus greener, works with the Green Team. Some of the changes that Paul has made to campus are the use of GreenSeal approved cleaning and paper products throughout the facilities staff, the implementation of mats made from recycled plastic and tires, vacuums that are Green Certified and the use of cleaning pads that are made from recycled bottles. Weigh the Waste: In partnership with Greek Life, the Green Team held this event to demonstrate the amount of food that is wasted during one after­noon at Salmanson Dining Hall. RecycleMania: Annual nationwide competition for colleges and universi- -. ties to increase and promote waste reduction and recycling throughout campus. Bryant has competed in RecycleMania for 3 years. New Printing System Coming to the Library: Piloting this summer, a new printing system will eliminate the need for a cover page with each student print job! Caps & Gowns for Commencement 2011: The Class of 2011 will be walk­ing under the Archway on May 21st wearing caps and gowns made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic bottles. Electronic Ordering System in South Dining: One of Sodexho's most re­cent green initiatives is the electronic ordering system in South. The waste­ful paper system that had been used in South for years was replaced with two electronic ordering kiosks over winter break. -. j\"---\". ~ . , .;.. 1 ._~ _' . j -. -~~, ,,'/ r,..
