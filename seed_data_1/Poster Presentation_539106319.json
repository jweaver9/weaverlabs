Poster Presentation By Sarah Williams and Dr. Stacy Creel Research posters and poster sessions are common occurrences in both virtual and physical academic and professional conferences. Posters provide the opportunity to communicate ideas and research in a succinct, attractive visual format (Gopal et. al, 2017). Academic posters may be used to share preliminary results, find research collaborators, present information at conferences, and as method to bring new researchers into the world of professional presentations (Durkin, 2011). In Philadelphia in 1982, poster sessions became a part of the American Library Association’s Annual Conference as “an effective forum for the exchange of information and a means to communicate ideas, research, and programs” (ALA, 2021). Even as face-to-face conferences shut down in the light of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the poster sessions carried on with calls for virtual participation in digital sessions.  Digital poster sessions can include live presentations or asynchronous interactions and still allow participants to interact, vote, and engage with presenters without the geographic limitations previously experienced by in-person conference. The Association of College and Research Libraries’ (ACRL) Distance and Online Learning Virtual Poster Session is a great example of allowing engagement without the scheduling of a live presentation. Posters are available for a week for comments and questions by viewers/attendees and responses by poster creators (ACRL, 2022).   Baker & Philips’ (2021) article about conference research posters aims to display information and tips for successful poster presentations that both novices and the experienced presenter can use. Not only do the authors discuss elements of an appealing poster, they also explain the reasoning behind why their tips work. Drawing on publication from other researchers, the authors present informed advice that assists readers with their own projects. The article begins by briefly explaining conferences and what to look for when deciding which one to attend. By knowing this information, first time presenters have the ability to find the best even to share their research.  Baker & Philips (2021) then explain the science behind poster layouts. Describing standards that presenters follow, the authors also provide resources that can help and inspire designs. In conjunction with layout advice, presentation of information and visualizations have ideal standards, such as the number of dots per inch for an image or font size.  Baker & Philips (2021) end their article by explaining how poster sessions are being handled in our current society in the aftermath of COVID-19. Poster sessions are being held online during the pandemic. The authors describe the different types of online poster sessions, which includes synchronous and asynchronous sessions along with others.

The study analyzed thecollection's content in terms of age demographic, genre,physical versus digital formats, and year of publication. Theimportance of this study lies in the need for libraries to dotheir best to offer both staples of graphic novels as well asa diversity of content in terms of audience and type, as wellas to promote visual literacy through graphic novelmaterials.METHODOLOGYThe researcher procured a list of the St. Tammany Parish PublicLibrary’s graphic novel collection from the library’s online catalog.Following this was a content analysis of the collection. Each workwas classified by audience demographic, genre, physical/electronicformat, and year of publication. The data collected was thenexamined to answer the study’s research questions.To determine how much of the collection was made up of graphicnovels, all works categorized under subject headings as “Graphicnovels,” “Comics (Graphic works),” and “Comic books, strips, etc.”were included since these were the three most commondesignators of graphic novel content.DISCUSSIONThere is no universal graphic novel banner.The classifications were numerous andinconsistent in detail. This could potentiallymake seeking out particular types of graphicnovels confusing.The majority of the graphic novels are aimedat juvenile readers. Works for adults were farfewer than those under juvenile or youngadult banners, suggesting that those incharge of collection development did notthink graphic novels for adult audienceshave as large a potential readership.Most of the items in the graphic novelcollection are physical rather than electronic.This suggests that acquisition of digitalgraphic novels has not been a major priorityfor the collection development team.DEFINITIONSGraphic novel: A standalone story told in sequential art(McCloud, 1994).Sequential art: The term Scott McCould used to describegraphic storytelling in general, regardless of whether thematerial in question was a newspaper strip or a multi-volumegraphic novel epic (McCloud, 1994).Visual literacy: The ability to interpret and evaluate images,specifically the ideas they communicate (Hoover, 2011).SELECTED REFERENCESBehler, A.

Has scholarly literature around ransomware increased over the last 10 years (2010-2020)?R2. Which journals have published the most literature on this topic between 2010 and 2020? R3. Which authors have published the most literature on this topic between 2010 and 2020?     CONCLUSIONIf Pundsack (2018) is correct in their statement that ransomware attacks on libraries are not a matter if, but when, thenthe lack of published data regarding ransomware from library-focused journals is noteworthy. It would be interesting tosee if searching for \"malware\" on LIS databases would produce more results than ransomware did. Regardless, librariesmust increase their awareness of this threat to ensure that they are able to safely and securely provide access to theirservices and respond to imminent cyber threats.  129 results were retrieved, but the data were limited to 99 full-text, peer-reviewed, English-language articles onransomware after duplicates were deleted.60 percent of the retrieved articles were published in the last 3 years.  Less than one third of the data’s journals and authors represented the core publishing results, so Bradford’s Law andLotka’s Law were supported within these results.Library-specific databases produced few results related to ransomware.   DISCUSSION    RESEARCH SUMMARYThe purpose of this research is to track publication data and the potential rise in ransomware literature located inscholarly journals over the last decade (2010-2020). Ransomware is one of the fastest growing malware threats to cybersecurity and should be studied and monitored in order to mitigate the threat (Alwan, 2019; Slayton, 2018; Veresha, 2018).This threat is especially relevant to Library and Information Science (LIS) professionals whose duties and patrons arepermanently entangled in increasingly digitized spaces and platforms (Rubin & Rubin, 2020). The intent of this study wasto gather and analyze data of published scholarly literature regarding ransomware in order to share this knowledge withLIS professionals for their own use and education.

What is IF's place in the history ofthe United States and how does itsupport diverse perspectives?  R2. How has the American concept ofIF evolved since the FirstAmendment's establishment?   R3. What are some documentedexamples of the varied ideologiesthat have been expressed bymembers of the LIS professionalcommunity in the last twenty years?  R4. How does the first amendment(the foundation of IF) allowadherence to such fundamentallydifferent ideological viewpoints?  Common Ground How the First Amendment and Intellectual Freedom Provide Room for Diverse Voices Shortly after the United States of Americawas formed, Congress ratified the FirstAmendment which safeguarded Americancitizens' freedoms of expression (\"Bill ofRights: A transcription,\" 2021). In the 20thcentury, the spirit of this amendment wascaptured in the term intellectual freedom (IF),which became the guiding focal point in theLibrary and Information Science (LIS)community's mission (ALA, 2019). Althoughstark differences of opinion have divided LIScolleagues, United States history hasdemonstrated that First Amendment rights(a.k.a. IF) can have the power to unite eventhose most staunchly opposed—they maynot have the same political beliefs but theycan agree on the importance of the FirstAmendment and IF.SummaryThis study examined the legal history andevolution of the First Amendment and the LIScore value of IF in the United States of Americaand explained how both conservative andliberal ideations are supported by this commonnational foundation.Objective Documentary analysis of court cases,historical events, personal interviews, andautobiographical content was used toexamine the evolution of the First Amendmentand IF and to discuss how IF (via the FirstAmendment) supports diverse views.MethodologyResearch QuestionsExplained IF’s connection to the FirstAmendment and its role in United Stateshistory.Used legal court case summaries and historicalevents to show the First Amendment'sevolution.Discussed and compared the diverseideologies held by both early American citizensand modern library professionals (via interviewsand autobiographical testimony documentedwithin peer-reviewed journal articles).Used this information to demonstrate how theFirst Amendment/IF support diverseperspectives. This historical analysis: DiscussionFurther research of this topic could expandon the evolution of the First Amendment andIF and broaden the scope of ideologiesrepresented within the LIS professionalcommunity. Successful execution of suchexpansion would require analyzing historicaldocuments prior to 1776 and conducting in-person interviews after IRB approval. As thetopics of the First Amendment and IF willnot lose relevance, an extension of thisstudy could yield better-defined results andapplications.

INTRODUCTIONFor several decadescommunity cookbooks havebeen an accepted, if slightlyminor, source of communityand regional history. OBJECTIVEThis project aimed to usepreviously digitized documentsfrom the community cookbookcollection at McCain Library toidentify common themes, andspecific subsection headings.METHODOLOGYThis project was a quantitativecontent analysis of the previouslydigitized cookbooks from thecommunity cookbook collectionhoused at McCain Library at theUniversity of Southern Mississippi. SubheadingsIllustrationsAdditional InfoEnclosuresANALYSISRESULTSThere were 125 different section titles acrossthe 16 books reviewed. Of that total, 41 werenon-recipe content while the remaining 84were different recipe sections. Two previously created ontologies thatcould be useful in this situation were theFood Ontology from BBC and the ontologycreated by the FoodOn project. This collection stood at a crossroadsbetween an archival collection and areference collection. Each book had signs ofusage including bent pages, torn pages,handwritten notes, and letters and recipescut out from other sources. RELATED LITERATUREBBC. (n.d.).

R2In each set of Caldecott Medal books,what were the main characteristics ofthose who experienced poverty?R3How do these characters compare to thepervasive stereotypes checklist aboutpoverty? What were the differencesbetween the sets? R4How do depictions within these books,including illustrations, reinforcestereotypes about poverty?Literature has been shown to be positively impactful on children (Good et al., 1998), and the lessons thatchildren absorb from literature can be long-lasting (Strnad & Hewitt, 2021). When children are exposed topoverty stereotypes through literature at an early age, they grow into adults who rely on those stereotypeswhen interacting with impoverished people (Mackey, 2013). Additionally, strict adherence to stereotypes canbe psychologically damaging to the person being stereotyped (Wiese et al., 2019). The Ugly Ducklingportrayed the highest number of poverty stereotypes of the literature reviewed in this study. The stereotypespresent in this children's book reinforce the several negative myths about poverty through both art and text,including that the impoverished are dirty, unkempt, animal-like, useless, and personally responsible for theirown poverty due to internal flaws or fate. The results demonstrated that children’s literature can and does in many ways reinforcestereotypes about poverty. Despite its limitations, this study was able to unearth andexamine several instances of stereotyping in the selected literature. Future studies whichinvestigate poverty stereotypes in children’s literature would perhaps receive more fruitfuland comprehensive results with a larger and more representative sample size of literature. The EndThis study investigated how poverty is portrayed in children’sliterature using two sets of Caldecott Medal award-winning andhonor books from the years 2000 and 2020. Of the nine booksselected for this study, only The Ugly Duckling and Joseph had aLittle Overcoat contained instances of impoverished characters.No depictions of poverty were found in the 2020 Caldecott titles.As seen in the Wealth Distribution chart below, two out of ninebooks (22%) portrayed poverty, one book (11%) portrayedinstances of wealth, and the remaining six books (67%) did notcontain any character who experienced poverty as defined bythis study. The limited sample size means that the results werenot generalizable, but this allowed for a more in-depth contentanalysis of the two books that did portray poverty. Selected ReferencesGood, R.

This hasimplications for open data access and webharvesting.The overall number of LGBTQ+ collectionswas small in proportion to all online findingaids.Findings support increased interest inLGBTQ historical research and targetedcollection mandates.Discussion & ConclusionFinding Aids for LGBTQ+ MaterialsSearch discovery platforms using LGBTQ+ related keywords Identify which platforms and descriptive elements lead to LGBTQ+ collectionsAnalyze descriptive elements and controlled access points oF LGBTQ+ finding aidsThe purpose of this research was to identify how LGBTQ+ archival materials weredescribed by research universities in the Southeastern United States.(3)Image derivative of work by Cory Doctorow (CC BY-SA 2.0) ",
