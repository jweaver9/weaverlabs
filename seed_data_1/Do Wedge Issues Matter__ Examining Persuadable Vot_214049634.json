Specifically, same-sex marriage has been \nsuggested as a key wedge issue that may have mobilized voters, although research differs on its \nimpact.  My contention is that these previous studies miss the point with regard to wedge issues, \nwhich is that they are useful on persuadable voters, and persuadable voters live in swing states.  I \nestimate a logit model using 2004 American National Election Studies survey data.  I utilize \nvoters‟ decisions to turn out as the dependent variable and control for respondents‟ positions on \nterrorism, the economy, same-sex marriage, political interest, party identification, and socio-\neconomic status.  These findings demonstrate, consistent with my hypothesis, voters in swing \nsame-sex marriage ballot measure states were more likely to turn out.  These voters may not have \nbeen persuadable, but rather the Republican base. \n \nINDEX WORDS: Persuadable voters, Mobilization, Presidential elections, Base voters, Swing \nstates, Swing voters, Same-sex marriage, Ballot measures, Wedge issues \n  \n DO WEDGE ISSUE BALLOT MEASURES MATTER?:  EXAMINING PERSUADABLE \nVOTERS AND BASE MOBILIZATION IN THE 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION \n \nby \n \nJAMES BENJAMIN TAYLOR \n \n \nA Thesis Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of \n \n \nMaster of Arts \nin the College of Arts and Sciences \nGeorgia State University \n \n \n \n2009 \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright by \nJames Benjamin Taylor \n2009 \n DO WEDGE ISSUE BALLOT MEASURES MATTER?:  EXAMINING PERSUADABLE \nVOTERS AND BASE MOBILIZATION IN THE 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION \n    \nby \n    \nJAMES BENJAMIN TAYLOR \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  Committee Chair: Sean Richey \n    \n  Committee: Richard Engstrom \n   Jason Reifler \n         \n    \nElectronic Version Approved:    \n    \nOffice of Graduate Studies    \nCollege of Arts and Sciences    \nGeorgia State University    \nMay 2009    \n    \n    \n    \niv \nDEDICATION \nI would like to dedicate this thesis to those people who have helped me get to where I am \ntoday—my wife, family and friends.

Agreement on the effect of wedge and social \nissues, however, has proven elusive.  Using 2004 American National Election Study (ANES) \ndata I estimate a logit model and find, consistent with the literature, that same-sex marriage \nballot measures (SSMBM) at-large were insignificant predictors for voter turnout.  However, I \nfind that the interaction of swing states with SSMBM makes respondents more likely to vote at a \nstatistically significant level.  Respondents most opposed to same-sex marriage were also \npredicted to turnout by the model.  Thus, in states like Ohio and Michigan—two heavily sought \nswing states—those who would mobilize on social issues were able to use the issue of same-sex \nmarriage, made salient by ballot initiatives, to make voters more likely to vote. \nWhile the topic of religious conservatives and their mobilization in the 2004 campaign is \na worthwhile topic to study (see Campbell (ed.) 2007 for an extended discussion), I am \nspecifically concerned with the use of wedge issue ballot measures and their effect on increasing \nthe probability of voting.  Using same-sex marriage in 2004 as a test case for wedge issue ballot \nmeasures, my results suggest that wedge issues on ballot measures can increase the likelihood of \na voter turning out if certain conditions apply.  Thus, in states like Ohio and Michigan—swing \nstates—those who would mobilize on wedge issues were able to use the issue of gay marriage, \nmade salient by ballot initiatives, to make voters more likely to vote.     \n2 \nThis project continues as follows.  Part I reviews the relevant literature on wedge issues, \nmobilization and the 2004 election.  Part II presents a theory of how SSMBM was used as a \nwedge issue to mobilize conservative voters, particularly in swing states.  Part III identifies my \nmethods and data collection, as well as the coding for the models presented.  Part IV \ndemonstrates my findings, and outlines the next step in data analysis for this project.  And \nfinally, Part V discusses limitations for the models presented, and adds suggestions for the next \nstep of this research.  \n \n \n \n \n3 \nCHAPTER 2. \nLITERATURE REVIEW \nIssue Voting \nIssues can be divided into “position” and “valence” categories (Stokes 1963).  Position \nissues are defined by their “advocacy of government actions from a set of alternatives over \nwhich the distribution of voter preferences is defined” (Stokes 1963, 373).  More simply put, \nposition issues are those issues where voters must prescribe to one candidate‟s policy remedy \nover the others—the voter must take a position.  Valence issues, conversely, need only have the \nvoter make a positive or negative assessment of the candidate or party with whom an issue is \nassociated (Stokes 1963).  Wedge issues are positional issues (Hillygus and Shields 2008).  \nCandidates use these issues to set out some policy objective (i.e. limit or prohibit abortion, same-\nsex marriage, stem cell research, allow school vouchers, etc.) in an effort to siphon off some \nportion of their oppositions‟ minimum winning coalition (Hillygus and Shields 2008).  Wedge \nissues are, however, not destined to remain as such forever. \nIssues generally, but wedge issues specifically, evolve (Carmines and Stimson 1989, \nHillygus and Shields 2008).  Issue evolution affects actors in the political process in two ways.  \nIt, as the name suggests, changes issues in such a way that they may or may not be effective in \nmobilizing or attracting voters the way the issue once did, and it shifts the region of acceptability \nsuch that what may once have seemed extreme could be considered general popular opinion \n(Rabinowitz and McDonald 1989; Carmines and Stimson 1989).  Carmines and Stimson‟s \n(1989) theory of issue evolution is grounded on the notion that issues go through processes—not \nunlike biological natural selection—to determine which issues are best suited for public \ndiscourse or debate, and those that are best suited for exploitation by politicians.  Of course, the \n4 \n“best” issues may not be the normatively “best,” or even the most important policy question \nbefore the citizens.  They are, instead, those issues that have meet era-specific requirements that \nenable them to move through the evolutionary mechanisms.  No matter where they are in the \nevolutional process, issues are constantly being used in elections and campaigns and can be \ncategorized based on the ease of their use.     \nFor the purposes of elections issues fall into two categories: hard issues and easy issues \n(Carmines and Stimson 1980).  Hard and easy issues differ in the types of responses voters give \nthem.  Easy issues get what have been termed “gut” responses from voters (Carmines and \nStimson 1980).  Although hard issues elicit gut responses as well they must be thought about in \ncareful, nuanced ways.  One distinction that Carmines and Stimson draw between voters is that \n“easy issue voters” are no more informed than the average non-voter (Carmines and Stimson \n1980).  Hard issue voters, conversely, are much better informed, and can sometimes be \ncategorized as “single issue” or simply “issue” voters because they are focused so intently on \ntheir given issue (Carmines and Stimson 1980). With this in mind, wedge issues can be classified \nas easy issues for three reasons.   \nFirst, most wedge issues, while position, met the requirement that the issue must be \nsymbolic, not technical (Kandel 2006, Carmines and Stimson 1980).  The debate around same-\nsex marriage, for instance, is symbolic because it focuses on the highly symbolic institution of \nmarriage (Kandel 2006, Wedgewood 1999).  Additionally, the main avenue employed by those \nwho would outlaw same-sex marriage is to have state constitutional amendments, despite the fact \nthat George W. Bush declared he would seek an amendment to the constitution of the United \nStates (CNN.com 2008).  These state initiatives would almost certainly come under the scrutiny \nof courts at some point in the future, whereas a U.S. constitutional amendment, assuming it \n5 \npassed, would be above judicial review.  More to the point, ballot initiatives banning same-sex \nmarriage simply rehash a debate ended by the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA (Pub. L. \n104-199, 100 Stat. 2419) (Domawatch.org 2008).  The DOMA first defined legal marriage as \nbetween a man and woman and then abdicated states from any responsibility of recognizing any \nrelationship between individuals of the same sex.  Thus, the ballot initiatives themselves can be \nthought of as symbolic because they were not implementing new law, but codifying for states \nwhat had already been sanctioned in statue at the federal level. \nThe next indicator of an easy issue is that it must deal with policy ends, not means \n(Carmines and Stimson 1980).  This is true of the same-sex marriage debate because the focus of \nthe debate was solely on the prohibition same-sex marriage instead of what the actual \nconstitutional channels were, or how difficult it would be to get a constitutional amendment \npassed that would officially declare it illegal (CNN.com).  Jonathan Kandel states that it was the \nfocus on the ends of the policy—prohibiting same-sex marriage—that gave the issue some of its \nsalience (Kandel 2006).  He points out that the gay rights frame—which focused primarily on the \nmeans of banning same-sex marriage and the problems with them—pushed by critics of the \nproposal never gained salience, so the ends were the only aspect of the policy considered in \npublic debate (Kandel 2006).   \nFinally, the last criterion to be met for an issue to be easy is for it to have been “long on \nthe political agenda” (Carmines and Stimson 1980).  Same-sex marriage, or least gay rights, has \nbeen a prominent national issue since at least 1969 with the Stonewall riots (Brittanica.com \n2009; Haider-Merkel and Meier 1996).  Ballot measures have also been used before to affect \npolicy with regard to gay rights.  In 1992, Oregon and Colorado placed initiatives on their ballots \nto eliminate sexual orientation from consideration in discrimination cases and new anti-\n6 \ndiscrimination laws (Haider-Merkel and Meier 1996).  By 2004, the debate about gay rights—\nwhich culminated with the same-sex marriage bans on 11 states‟ ballots and a possible \namendment to the U.S. constitution—had 12 years to be on the political agenda, and was \nsufficiently primed to motivate voters to go to the polls.  Whether or not it worked is another \nquestion.              \n \nMobilization and Ballot Measures \n Mobilization for electoral contests is a war fought on many fronts.  Campaigns and \nparties rely on a combination of face-to-face canvassing, phone banks, media strategies, and \ncandidate appearances to energize their supporters.  Some studies support the general theory—\nwithout explicitly stating it—that as mobilization efforts have become more impersonal their \neffectiveness has also decreased (Putnam 2000, Rosenstone and Hansen 1993).  Testing that \ntheory using experimental methods, Alan Gerber and Donald Green (2000) state that personal \ncontact is in fact a more effective mobilization strategy.  Personal contact suggests a 9.8% \nincrease in turnout, while direct mail—according to their model—increases turnout about 0.6% \n(Gerber and Green 2000).  Successful mobilization on wedge issues is generally dependent on \nperson-to-person contact, and this is certainly the case for 2004 (Campbell and Monson 2008).  \nChurches and religious organizations were vital to getting out the message and knocking on \ndoors (Campbell and Monson 2007).  The key point about 2004 and wedge issues is that those \nwho would be most activated by those issues were not mobilizing for an esoteric goal or \nephemeral hope.  They had concrete evidence—in the form of a legally binding ballot measure—\nthat their policy objectives could be achieved with their efforts. \n7 \nStephen Nicholson, in Voting the Agenda (2005), claims that ballot measures can increase \nsalience for an issue, prime voters to evaluate candidates differently that they would in the \nabsence of that ballot measure, and mobilize voter turnout.  He demonstrates compelling \nevidence for ballot measure priming with Proposition 187—a ballot initiative to bar illegal \nimmigrants from schools, social services, and non-emergency health facilities—and the 1994 \nCalifornia governor‟s race (2005).  His probit analysis shows that voters who mentioned the \nballot proposition significantly increased their likelihood of voting for the Republican Pete \nWilson, regardless of their self-identified party.  Nicholson states that is was Republicans‟ \ncampaigning on illegal immigration via Prop 187‟s presence on the ballot that primed voters just \nenough to give Wilson the victory (2005).  Furthermore, Nicholson shows that some voters \nwould not vote at all in the absence of Prop 187 (2005).  There can certainly be problems for \nparties and candidates if they rely on ballot measures.  One such problem is absurdly high \nreading levels for ballot measure language (Reilly and Richey 2008), which could have the effect \nof confusing some voters.  The research on SSMBM readability has yet to find significant \nresults, but the trend is toward more difficult readability.  Even with this potential hazard, \nresearch suggests that it can be effective in presidential elections as well. \n Ballot initiatives, like same-sex marriage in the 2004 presidential election, have a varied \nliterature with respect to their effects.  One aspect that is certain about ballot initiatives is that \nthey have educative effects (Smith 2001).  That is, with all things equal, a ballot initiative raises \nawareness of an issue and increases its salience (Tolbert and Smith 2005).  Though there is \nconflicting scholarship on whether ballot initiatives are more important for mid-term or \npresidential elections, the general consensus is that initiatives mobilize voters—particularly ones \nwith a deep interest for the issue in question—to the polls (Smith 2001; Tolbert et al. 2001; \n8 \nTolbert and Smith 2005).  Tolbert and Smith do go so far as to make the claim ballot initiatives \nhave the capacity to effect the results of presidential elections given their uses by increasing the \nvisibility and salience of an issue (2005).  Ballot initiatives that receive high amounts of \nspending—through mobilization efforts by candidates or issues advocacy groups—on their \nbehalf have also been shown to increase issue salience and awareness (Nicholson 2003). \n Even though ballot initiatives have proven educative effects, same-sex marriage and \nsocial issues were prominent news stories, and mobilization was predicated on both of these \nfacts, same-sex marriage is not universally accepted as a motivator for turnout in 2004 \n(Abramowitz and Stone 2006, Abramowitz 2004, Burden 2004, Hillygus and Shields 2005).  The \nonly studies SSMBM having an effect do so with voting for Bush as the dependent variable \n(Campbell and Monson 2007), or at the aggregate level within very small geographic areas \n(LaFrance and Fredrick 2007, Smith, DeSantis and Kassel 2006). It is because of this debate that \nI propose to examine the issue once more to discern what effect same-sex marriage had on \nrespondents to the 2004 Nation Election Study.  Scholarship on this topic has implications for \nballot initiatives and social issues as mobilization tools.     \n \n2004 Presidential Election \nThe 2004 presidential election is notable because of the wedge issues and the role they \nare suspected to have played in that election (Campbell and Monson 2008).  The issue of same-\nsex marriage (or social issues in general) and its effect in the 2004 presidential election has been \nthe subject of much debate.  As was mentioned in the introduction, most media commentators \nand indeed the Bush campaign themselves attributed their victory—the first winning majority \nsince 1988—to social issues and social conservatives coming out to vote (Abramowitz 2004, \n9 \nGuth et. al. 2006, Campbell and Monson 2007).  Research, however, has offered myriad \nexplanations for Bush‟s victory in 2004 including, but not limited to, support of President Bush‟s \nhandling of terrorism, the general expansion of the Republican Party, and social issues. \nApproval of the handling of terrorism as an explanation was one of the first issues to \nreceive traction in scholarly literature, and seems plausible as a motivator in 2004.  Because the \nterrorists‟ attacks of September 11, 2001 were still fresh in the minds of voters they could have \nbeen primed to evaluate the candidates on how they would handle another attack (Abramowitz \n2004; Kaufmann 2006; Burden 2004; Hillygus and Shields 2005).  Abramowitz, for instance, \nfinds no significant relationship between same-sex marriage amendments being present on \nballots and an increase in aggregate turnout by state in the 2004 election (2004).  He does find \nsignificant evidence for increased Bush support in the states most clearly affected by the 9/11 \nattacks: New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.\n1\n  As an explanation of those findings \nAbramowitz suggests that Bush‟s win in 2004 was a simple expansion of his vote share from \n2000 because of terrorism, and in spite of same-sex marriage amendments (2004).   \nOther research has shown that women—who have generally tended to vote Democratic \n(Kaufmann 2006)—voted for Bush because of questions about terrorism and who was best suited \nto lead the country on that issue, thus showing again that Bush‟s victory was a function of \nRepublican Party expansion (Burden 2004).  As previously mentioned, however, terrorism was \nnot the only issue that seemed to be on the minds of voters. \nThe previous null findings notwithstanding, same-sex marriage and social issues have \nbeen found to have been important—to varying degrees—for the 2004 general election in a \nnumber studies (Lewis 2005, Smith, DeSantis and Kassel 2006, Knuckey 2007, Kaufmann 2006, \n                                                          \n1\n This finding seems moot given that all three of these states are considered, and were in 2004, “Blue States.”  \nKandel offers his own perspective on the Red State-Blue State divide (2006).    \n10 \nMcDonald 2004, Guth et. al. 2006, Campbell and Monson 2007, Campbell and Monson 2008).  \nThis research lacks a unified voice, however, because none of them have used dichotomous \nturnout as a dependent variable, and none of the studies seem to highlight where, if anywhere, \nthe SSMBM were more effective.  There is agreement, even among those who demonstrate null \nfindings for same-sex marriage as a predictor of voting, that same-sex marriage or social issues \nwere important to voters in the abstract (Hillygus and Shields 2005; Knuckey 2007).  Hillygus \nand Shields point to exit polls for the 2004 election showed that “moral values” were important \nto 22% of voters, which is at least a percentage higher than any other category in the survey \n(Hillygus and Shields 2005).\n2\n  So, there is still room to clarify where the wedge issue of the 2004 \nPresidential election had its effect, if it had any at all.   \n \n \n \n                                                          \n2\n I share the authors‟ complaint about same-sex marriage being lumped into the “moral values” category, and it is \nfor that reason that I use the term “social issues” throughout the paper.  The point is, however, that those in favor or \nagainst same-sex marriage could declare it a moral issue.  Thus, the exit poll only serves to illustrate the fact that \npeople thought same-sex marriage—or social issues in general—were important. \n11 \nCHAPTER 3. \nTHEORY AND HYPOTHESES \nResearch Question \nTheories on voter turnout and mobilization fall into two primary schools of thought.  The \nfirst is the base mobilization theory.  It states that voters will most often follow their partisan \nidentification in the ballot box, and parties are the most effective at winning elections when they \nmobilize their partisan identifiers (Campbell et al. 1960; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; \nWielhouwer and Lockerbie 1994; Bartels 2000; Green, Palmquist and Schickler 2002; \nHolbrooke and McClurg 2005).  Scholars note that that party mobilization is useful in mobilizing \nthose who are the least likely to vote under normal circumstances—the poor, minorities, and the \nless educated (Rosenstone and Hanson 1993).  Most often, however, targets for mobilization by \nparties are not these groups, but instead those readily identify with a party (Brady, Scholzman, \nand Verba 1999).  Brady et al. state that this base mobilization is the result of parties seeking to \nmaximize their scare resources (1999).  The work by Holbrooke and McClurg (2005) succinctly \nillustrates the prevailing position for adherents to the base mobilization thesis.   \nHolbrooke and McClurg use three consecutive Presidential Elections—1992, 1996, and \n2000—to test the effect of campaign activity on aggregate turnout.  Their equivalent test for base \nmobilization is a measure of the “party transfers” between national and state political parties \nduring an election.  Holbrooke and McClurg point out that these funds are used primarily to \nmobilize core part supporters, so an increase in these funds should demonstrate two substantive \neffects: increased base mobilization and attention to the electoral outcome in that state.  In all of \ntheir aggregate turnout models the party transfer variable is positive and significant.  They test \ntheir theory, as well, by making the proportion of independent from election to election the \n12 \ndependent variable, and find that electoral context—things like Senate races and third party \ncandidates—make the percentage of independents go up.  The variable that makes aggregate \nturnout more likely, party transfers, has no effect on the percentage of independents.  Holbrooke \nand McClurg summarize their project by saying the question for election scholars is no longer \n“do campaigns mobilize,” but “whom do campaigns mobilize (2005)?”             \nResearch offers more than one answer to that question.  For the preceding groups of \nscholars the answer is clearly partisans, but another school of thought would claim that \ncampaigns mobilize persuadable voters (Hillygus and Shields 2008). The persuadable voter \nthesis is the primary challenger to the established base mobilization theory.  Building off of the \nconsiderable issue voting literature (Stokes 1963; Carmines and Stimson 1980; Aldrich, Sullivan, \nand Borgida 1989; Carmines and Stimson 1989; Petrocik 1996; Campbell 2002), Sunshine \nHillygus and Todd Shields develop a new theory on voting in Presidential Elections.  Though \nrooted in issue voting, the persuadable voter thesis presumes the existence of “wedge issues” \n(Hillygus and Shields 2008).   \nWedge issues have been discussed in popular media for some time (see Hillygus and \nShields 2008 for an extended review of newspaper and political operative quotes).  Hillygus and \nShields‟ definition is as follows, “any policy concern that is used to divide the opposition‟s \npotential winning coalition (2008).”  They state that moral issues such as same-sex marriage and \nstem cell research are the classic wedge issues, but the war in Iraq or certain tax policies could \nvery well serve the same goal—persuade people vote for a candidate based on one issue (see \nBartels 2005 for an example of taxes being a wedge issue).  They test this theory using vote \ndefections by identified partisans.  They demonstrate that the odds of Democrats voting for \nRepublicans and vice versa are made less likely the more partisan a voter is.  Also, they show \n13 \nthat being cross-pressured on moral issues in 2004 makes voters more likely to vote against their \nparty‟s candidate.  They also infer that leaning partisans and voters who typify one party‟s \ntypical voter (i.e. church-going Democrats) are more likely to receive direct mail, or get a door-\nto-door canvasser.  All of this leads Hillygus and Shields to claim that voters can be persuaded, \nand that it is persuasion on wedge issues that can make the difference in an election. \nWith the preceding discussion in mind, I propose my own method to test both the base \nmobilization thesis and the persuadable voter thesis.  I do so with American National Election \nStudy (ANES) data from 2004 when same-sex marriage was the primary wedge issue of the \ncampaign.  My theory is that if one is to see the effects of a persuasion campaign it will be seen \nin two places, one geographical and one voter characteristic.  The geographic locations are swing \nstates.  We know that campaigns spend an inordinate amount of time on specific states that are \npossible for either candidate to win.  Daron Shaw (2005) states that voters in swing states are less \nknowledgeable than voters generally, which suggests that they may not be as effective at \ncountering arguments made by opinion leaders like political candidates.  The voter characteristic \nthat would demonstrate the presence or absence of mobilization is that of religion.  Numerous \nstudies have demonstrated that religion played a large role in the 2004 campaign (Campbell and \nMonson 2007, Campbell and Monson 2008).  Hillygus and Shields also note the effort of the \nBush campaign to target those who were even marginally religious (2008).  Given what we know \nabout ballot measures, the knowledge levels of swing state voters, religion, and the role of party \nidentification the key persuadable voters in the 2004 election were anti-same-sex marriage \nDemocrats.  Same-sex marriage ballot measures should make them more likely to vote.  Also, \nswing states with same-sex marriage ballot measures will be made more likely to vote because of \nthe concentration of media coupled with low political knowledge generally. \n14 \nHypotheses \n Based on the theoretical framework there are two hypotheses for how the state level \nfactors—swing state status and SSMBM—will affect turnout.  They are as follows: \n   H1:  Voters in swing states will be more likely to turn out. \n   H2:  Voters in states with SSMBM will be more likely to turn out. \nHypothesis one should be confirmed in spite of low political knowledge, and because campaigns \nconcentrate a large portion of their effort on these states (Shaw 2008).  Testing these hypotheses \nwill fill in the gaps in the literature with regard to wedge issues and ballot measures.  At this \npoint, scholarship is silent on if these are useful or effective tools for mobilization.   \n To adequately test the persuadable voter and mobilization theses I propose two \nhypotheses.  Hypothesis three test for persuasion. \n   H3:  Democrats who are against same-sex marriage should be more likely to turn out. \nIf, however, the mobilization thesis is correct for the 2004 Presidential Election we should expect \nhypothesis four. \n   H4:  Republican should be more likely to vote than Democrats. \nHypothesis three is tested using an interaction of Democrats and those against same-sex \nmarriage.  Hypothesis four is tested under the full model with no conditioning interaction.     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \nCHAPTER 4. \nDATA AND METHODOLOGY \nData \nThe data I used to construct my dataset was taken from the 2004 ANES.  My dependent \nvariable, the choice of the respondent to vote or not to vote, was coded dichotomously with “1” \nequaling the decision to vote.  A discrete dependent variable requires that I use a logit model to \nestimate the probabilities of turning out.  The variables that literature suggests predict turnout—\nage, education, income, gender, and race—are controlled for in the models (Campbell et al. \n1960, Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980, Lewis-Beck et al. 2008).\n3\n  To gauge the attention and \ninterest of the NES respondents I develop an index from 5 questions on the survey (α = .66).  I \nhave created this index because research tells us that those who pay more attention are more \nlikely to be politically knowledgeable and vote (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996).  The scores \nrange from “0,” implying that the respondent has little to no interest or attention in the 2004 race, \nto “1,” meaning that the respondent is highly attentive or has close to maximum interest in the \ncampaign. A control for party identification—a strong indicator of turnout (Campbell et al. \n1960)—is developed by making two dichotomous variables.  I take all ANES respondents who \nclaim to be at least Independent-Republicans (so too with Democrats) to be “Republicans.”  \nThus, there is a Republican variable and a Democrat variable with Independents being the absent \ncategory.     \nControls for issues in the 2004 election are respondents‟ approval of the economy and \ntheir emphasis on terrorism as a foreign policy challenge.  Both of these issues were important to \nthe campaign, and they have proven significant in previous research (Abramowitz 2004, Hillygus \nand Shields 2005, Elder and Greene 2007, LaFrance and Fredrick 2007).  The respondents‟ \n                                                          \n3\n A detailed explanation of the coding process, survey questions, and possible responses are included in Appendix 2 \n16 \npositions on same-sex marriage are made dichotomous from the original ANES variable.  The \nANES asked respondents to choose between marriage, civil unions, and no formal recognition of \nany kind.  Similar to the party identification specification, this trichotomous position scale allows \nme to control for those for and against same-sex marriage.  There are some who would disagree \nwith “civil unions” being a separate category (Wedgewood 1999) because it is considered anti-\nsame-sex marriage; however I follow Hillygus and Shields‟ (2008) contention that some citizens \ndo see civil unions as compromise policy position.  Finally, the presence of a SSMBM was \ndichotomous with the presence equal to “1.”   \nThroughout literature on voter turnout the “South” (i.e. the 11 states of the former \nConfederacy) is controlled for based on its historically low turnout (Rosenstone and Wolfinger \n1978), so I, too, control for respondents from southern states with a dichotomous variable.  \nResearch indicates that higher income earners, better educated, and older voters are more likely \nto vote (Campbell et al. 1960, Piven and Cloward 2000).  I expect these variables to hold to their \nhistorical pattern.  For the presence of a gubernatorial or senate race I use CNN.com‟s election \nwebpage from 2004.  A summary of the variables is displayed in Table 1. \n \nMethods \n I use Stata 10.1 to estimate a logit model.  Logit models estimate the probability of some \nevent occurring.  The coefficients are not directly interpretable, and the interpretation of \ninteraction terms is also problematic (Ai, Norton, and Wang 1999).  To avoid the complications \nwith these interpretations I use Clarify (King et al. 2000).  Clarify estimates predicted \nprobabilities that are directly interpretable, and allows for the manipulation of those estimates.  \nThus, when all variables are set to mean or modal categories one can observe the direct effect of \n17 \na one unit change by the variable of interest on the odds of the dependent variable—in this case \nvoting—occurring.    Clarify also produces a confidence interval for each predicted probability \nTable 1: Summary of Variables \nVariable Observations Mean Std. Dev. Min.

Box plots based on the \nClarify estimates testing the hypotheses are contained in the Discussion.   To account for \nheteroskedasticity, which could bias my results, I calculate robust standard errors clustered on \nthe respondent‟s state for the models making Type 1 errors less probable (Graves 2003).  To test \nmodel fit I use both receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC) and estimated percent \ncorrectly predicted calculations (Herron 1999).  ROC curves demonstrate how much of the \nvariance of the dependent variable is explained by the model (Richey 2008), while ePCP \nrepresents the percentage of correctly predicted 0s and 1s in the model.   \n   \n18 \nCHAPTER 5. \nFINDINGS AND ANALYSIS \n            The model in Table 2 is the basic version of this project‟s turnout model.  Included are \nthe socio-economic status indicators that have historically predicted turnout in the American \nelectorate.  This model conforms to the expected direction for each variable with the exception of \nincome.  Income is generally predictive of higher turnout, but education could be soaking up \nmost of income‟s statistical power.  Also in the model are two state-level variables—SSMBM \nand swing state status.  Per the theory, swing state voters should be less likely to turnout, while \nSSMBM states should be more likely.  Swing state status is negative and statistically significant, \nbut SSMBM are negative as well.  This is contrary to the theory, but because the coefficient \nlacks statistical significance there is little we can glean from it at this time.  The estimated \npercent correctly predicted (ePCP) is about 80% suggesting that this model specification is \naccurately predicting about 80% of the turnout decisions in 2004.  This model is presented to \nmake the point that the ANES 2004 sample performs the way American electoral behavior \nscholars expect. \nTable 2: Basic Model for Voter Turnout in 2004 \nVariable Coefficient Robust S.E. \nSSMBM -1.120   1.046 \nSwing State -1.946   0.561*** \nRepublican 3.394   0.743*** \nDemocrat 1.477   0.907 \nEducation 0.931   0.411* \nIncome -0.023   0.062 \nAge 0.204   0.104\n+\n \nAge\n2 \n-0.001   0.001 \nWhite  1.207   0.778 \nMale -0.274   0.738 \nSouth -0.748   0.490 \nConstant -8.619   3.478* \nN = 913;\n+\n p < .10, *p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001; Robust Standard Errors are clustered on 27 \nstates; ROC Curve = .8591; Wald χ2 = 30.49, p < .001; ePCP = .791 \n19 \nTable 3 demonstrates the full model without interactions.

The \nissue positions are all insignificant as well.  Interestingly, voters with SSMBM are less likely to \nturnout according to this model.  This is contrary to the hypothesized direction, but the \ninteraction of SSMBM and Swing States still poses some possibility.  Other variables that are \nsignificant—Republicans and Attention Index—have interesting implications.  Specifically, if \nthe persuadable voter thesis is correct, we should not see a difference between the likelihood of \nRepublicans and Democrats to vote.  This appears to be the case, but the Democrat coefficient is \n20 \ninsignificant.  To fully test the persuadable voter hypothesis, I now move to the interactive \nmodels.  \nTable 4 displays the tests for the interactive hypotheses.  Specifically, I expect that voters \nin swing states with SSMBM will more likely to vote, and that Democrats who are against same \nsex marriage should be made more likely to vote if the SSMBM are to be considered effective \nmobilization tools.  I include the constituent terms so as not to bias the model (Brambor et al. \n2006).  In the first model, I test for swing states with SSMBM.  The effects of party \nidentification—Republicans being likely to vote—are present and still significant, which gives \nweight to the proponents of base mobilization.     \nTable 4:  Interaction Models for Voter Turnout in 2004 \nVariable Coeff.

The \nePCP and ROC curves both demonstrate that the models are generally good at estimating the \ndecision to turnout in 2004.  Though the positive and significant coefficient in the first Table 4 \nmodel suggests that my theory is correct, further investigation is warranted.   \nTested in the second model is the anti-sex marriage Democrat interaction.  This \ninteraction is also positive, but statistically insignificant.  As with the swing states with SSMBM, \nthe positive direction of the coefficient is hopeful for the persuadable voter theory, but without \nsignificance there is not much that can be inferred.  A better test is a three-way interaction using \nDemocrats who are anti-same sex marriage and live in SSMBM states.  There is simply not \nenough data to appropriately test that variable with the data presented here.  I larger dataset or a \npanel data model could allow for such an interaction.  To further parse the effects of the \ninteractions I estimate predicted probabilities using Clarify (King et al. 2000) presented in Figure \n1\n4\n.    \nThe first box plot of the table displays the results of the basic model by estimating the \nprobability for voting in 2004 with the variable values set at their mean or modal categories.  A \nwhite man\n5\n, living in a non-swing state without a SSMBM, but who is generally concerned about \nterrorism, disapproving of the economy, making around $30,000 a year with a high school \ndiploma, who pays some attention to the campaign, and average party identification—one might \nsay an “average voter” at-large—has about a 70% chance of going to the polls on Election Day.  \nThis finding is difficult to square with reality when turnout was actually around 60% for the \nvoting eligible population (McDonald 2004).  Consequently, over-reporting of turnout in the \n                                                          \n4\n At-Large: Swing (0), SSMBM (0), Terror (mean), Economy (mean), Anti-SSM (1), Pro-SSM (0), Index (.25), \nSouth (0), Senate (1), Governor (0), Rep (mean), Dem (mean), Education (mean), Income (mean), Age (mean), Age\n2\n \n(mean), White (mean), Male (mean), South (0); Estimated in Stata 10.1, See King et al. (2000) for information on \nClarify  \n5\n Research suggests that men who did not turnout in 2000 were the targets of the Bush Campaign.  This is the reason \nmen are referenced for the predicted probabilities (Kauffman 2006, Elder and Greene 2007). \n22 \nANES is one limitation to this project.   Other problematic aspects are the confidence intervals.  \nThey are quite wide making substantive interpretation difficult.  The chances of the average \nvoter at-large turning out range from less than 40% to over 85%, which is too large to draw any \nsolid conclusions, and does not directly test the hypotheses. \n0\n.2\n.4\n.6\n.8\n1\nNote:  2004 ANES data, Predicted Probabilities obtained via Clarify\nAt-Large SSMBM\nSwing States w/ SSMBM\nP(vote=1)\n \nFigure 1:  Predicted Probabilities for Voter Turnout in 2004 \n Per the theory, I expect that SSMBM will make voters more likely to turn out.  The \naverage voter at-large has about a 70% chance of turning out.  McDonald (2004) states that \nturnout was actually around 60%.  According the data used in this project, voters who lived in \nstates with SSMBM with all of the average characteristics had between 15 and 30% chance of \nturning out, within the 90% confidence intervals.  This is an underwhelming result, and suggests \nthat the presence of SSMBM may not have been enough to motivate voters to turnout. \n The last box plot displays the result for the swing states with SSMBM interaction \nhypothesis in Table 3.  The chances for average voters to turnout in these states are somewhat \nbetter.  The high-end of the 90% confidence interval around 40%, but this is still well below the \n23 \nchances of the average voter to turnout.  These box plots indicate that average voters in swing \nstates with SSMBM are only marginally more likely to vote than voters in SSMBM generally.  \nThus, the theory and hypotheses remain unconfirmed by these estimations.         \n A robust test of the theory would be to estimate the probability of a Republican or \nDemocrat turning out to vote in SSMBM swing states.  Unfortunately, the data would be \ncompromised to such an extent as to render any results difficult to justify with reality.  I therefore \nrefer to Table 4 to conclude the findings for the last hypothesis.  Democrats against same-sex \nmarriage were not predicted to turnout at a statistically significant level.  The coefficient is \npositive, but without significance there is little one can say about this finding.  Furthermore, the \nanti-same-sex marriage variable tests these voters at large.  There is no way to know if these \nvoters live in swing states, non-swing states, or SSMBM states.  Three-way interactions would \nprove useful, but, as has been stated, the data would be compromised in such as way as to render \nit useless.  A dataset with more respondents or a cross-sectional time series could make a three-\nway interaction more viable.  Though the theory is not confirmed the death knell has yet to \nsound.       \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n24 \nCHAPTER 6. \nCONCLUSIONS \n The debate about persuasion versus base mobilization is a persistent one in American \nelectoral behavior.  Each election there appears to be one issue that trumps all others presumably \nmaking voters rethink their eventual vote choice, and is given credit for taking one candidate to \nvictory.  In 2004, that issue was same-sex marriage (Campbell and Monson 2007).  Some \nscholars claim that wedge issue made the difference for George W. Bush in 2004 by persuading \nDemocrats to vote for him—the Republican—in contradiction to their other policy positions \n(Hillygus and Shields 2008).  Also, there is ample reason to think that the presence of wedge \nissue ballot measures and the state in which they were found affected the degree to which voters \nturned out in 2004 (Nicholson 2005, Shaw 2008).  I test those theories by using a logit model and \ncalculating predicted probabilities in Clarify. \n For the persuadable voter thesis to be correct Democrats who lived in the swing states \nwith SSMBM should be more likely to vote, all else being equal.  Testing the persuadable voter \ntheory on turnout is important because what politicians ultimately want to do is change the \nelectorate in their favor.  This can be accomplished, as Hillygus and Shields state, by observing \nparty identifying vote defectors.  A more robust test is, as this project does, to utilize turnout \nbecause if wedge issues are able to entire portions of the electorate—Democrats who are against \nsame-sex marriage, for instance—then persuasion is certainly a profitable tactic.  Unfortunately \nfor those in the persuadable voter camp, this project finds no evidence to substantiate their claim.  \nThe coefficient for Democrats who are against same-sex marriage is positive but insignificant.  \nFurthermore, the models presented here lack the statistical power to estimate three-way \ninteractions for the location of these voters. \n25 \n It seems that the presence of SSMBM at-large had no effect on turnout in 2004.  In fact, \nthe insignificant coefficient is negative contrary to the hypothesized direction.  Living in a swing \nstate is indicative of lower probabilities for turnout, but again the lack of statistical significance \nlimits the amount one can say about that finding.  Voters living in swing states with SSMBM \nwere more likely to vote at the .10 level.  The extreme significance of Republicans turnout out to \nvote coupled with the insignificance of Democrats turnout out to vote seems to suggest that there \nwas little persuasion going on in 2004.  The SSMBM in swing states may have motivated \nturnout, but those voters were likely the Republican base.  However, to substantiate that claim \nmore research will have to be done.  A cross-sectional time series using two decades or more of \nPresidential Elections would be better able to test that hypothesis. \n One of the limitations is the over-reporting of voter turnout in the 2004 NES.  While this \nis an unavoidable problem, the results must be taken into consideration with the over-reporting in \nmind.  Secondly, using more than one election and more than one wedge issue would be the next \nevolution of any project like this.  There is limited generalizability from any study using only \none election, but this research does suggest that this is an area worthy of scholarship.  Knowing \nif the electorate can be changed—rather than campaigns mobilizing the same voters over and \nover—is important both for academic purposes and practical political reasons.  \n In summary, those who suggest that wedge issues as a mobilization tools are red herrings \nmay not be correct.  Growing research suggests that wedge issues may have, in fact, played a \nrole in the 2004 campaign helping George W. Bush get reelected (Lewis 2005, Smith et al. 2006, \nHillygus and Shields 2008, Campbell and Monson 2008).  This research adds to that chorus and \ngoes further to suggest that it was in swing states where same-sex marriage ballot measures and \npossible mobilization efforts had the most effect.  The proposals for further research should \n26 \nmake the results of this research more solid, and move the literature on wedge issues, ballot \nmeasures, and their effects on mobilization forward.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n27 \nREFERENCES \nAbramowitz, Alan.

    "abstract": "In the 2004 Presidential Election social and wedge issues were among the most publicized mobilization tools utilized by the Bush Campaign. Specifically, same-sex marriage has been suggested as a key wedge issue that may have mobilized voters, although research differs on its impact. My contention is that these previous studies miss the point with regard to wedge issues, which is that they are useful on persuadable voters, and persuadable voters live in swing states. I estimate a logit model using 2004 American National Election Studies survey data. I utilize voters’ decisions to turn out as the dependent variable and control for respondents’ positions on terrorism, the economy, same-sex marriage, political interest, party identification, and socio-economic status. These findings demonstrate, consistent with my hypothesis, voters in swing same-sex marriage ballot measure states were more likely to turn out. These voters may not have been persuadable, but rather the Republican base",
