It’s the same thing except you’re going to get money,” Alexis said. “I feel like people make it more dramatic than it really is.”“Sugar babies” are young students who receive finan-cial rewards in return for providing varying levels of affection to a “sugar daddy” or “sugar momma.” Alexis said she used Seek-ing Arrangements to pay for her lifestyle — luxury hand-bags, high end make-up and jewelry for her puppy.“I can’t call my parents and ask them to give me $350,” Alexis said. “I can now just get the things that I want more readily.”Violet, a radio-televi-sion-film sophomore and former user, said although the transactions are not re-quired to be sexual, some-times the clients pay too little if they aren’t.“The (clients) that offer the most money are always going to be the ones that are sexual,” Violet said. “Most girls do it for quick cash to pay for things that they have to, or they do it for gifts.”Violet said the service made her feel like she was selling her body.“These guys are obviously paying for things that are not normal in real relationships,” Violet said. “You struggle with intimacy after.”The website numbers reveal that one in 71 UT students are currently on Seeking Arrangements, meaning an average class of 100 students likely contains several users. The site mainly markets to female college students burdened with debt as the website displays a ticking student debt clock on its sign up page. Josette D’Espyne, The Texas House of Representatives tentatively approved a bill that would designate UT Austin af-filiate Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center as the state botanical garden and arboretum. State Rep. Donna How-ard, D-Austin, said House Bill 394 would expand the Center’s educational pro-grams, research projects and conservation work. Founded in 1982 by former first lady Lady Bird Johnson and ac-tress Helen Hayes, the Center is the largest of its kind in the state to showcase only flow-ers and plants native to Texas. “This is a simple but — I would call it — momentous bill honoring the contribu-tions to Texas of Lady Bird Johnson and the wildflow-er center which bears her name,” Howard said last Under a dark Tower Mon-day night, UT honored a dis-tinguished alumna and pas-sionate Longhorn — Margaret C. Berry.Berry died at the age of 101 just after midnight Sunday, according to the Austin Amer-ican-Statesman, ending a life-time as an active member and an alumna of the University her whole life.Born in 1915 in Dawson, Texas, Berry received her Bachelor of Arts in history from UT in 1937 and her mas-ter’s and doctorate in history from Columbia University. Berry was the only individ-ual to be both a member of Texas Orange Jackets and an honorary Tejas brave. Tejas Club President McK-ay Proctor, English and busi-ness honors senior, said Ber-ry was an incredible friend, mentor and godmother to the Tejas braves. “The Club has been around for 90 years, (and) we have been guided by Margaret C. Berry for the majority of that,” Name: UT Athletics; Width: 60p0; Depth: 2 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: -1Thursday, April 13, 2017@thedailytexan facebook.com/dailytexanServing the University of Texas at Austin community since 1900dailytexanonline.com bit.ly/dtvidLEGACY CAMPUSUT students,  faculty mourn   loss of alumna Margaret BerryHouse bill to determine state botanical gardenUTPD officers talk crime in big citiesMichael Murphy was one block away from Cole Hall during his sophomore year at Northern Illinois Univer-sity when a former student entered the classroom, fatally shot five people and wounded 16 others in a 2008 St. Valen-tine’s Day massacre.“That’s when my career plans made a turn,” said Mur-phy, a UT Police Department Officer. “I saw how fast the police reacted and threw themselves into danger to pro-tect that community. That’s something that I keep with me even now.”Like many UTPD officers, Murphy brought a diverse background in law enforce-ment with him when he began at UTPD. After working for two years as a patrol officer with the Village of Crestwood Police Department in the southside of Chicago, Murphy decided to make the transi-tion to campus policing about three years ago. “Directing traffic in a bliz-zard just wasn’t something I wanted to do my whole life,” Murphy said. “When I was presented with the opportu-nity to serve with (UTPD), I knew it was perfect. My life had led me full circle after (the shooting).”Murphy’s transition from a big city to campus is an ex-perience many UTPD officers share. For 28 years, officer Wil-liam Pack worked with the Los Angeles Police Depart-ment combating Hollywood prostitution, central LA gangs and even the Rodney King ri-ots before settling down at UT.

Await-ing a final vote on House Bill 394, the UT affiliate could become the state botanical garden and arboretum.By Claire Allbright@claireallbrightLADY BIRD page 2UNIVERSITYAfter meeting a girl in Jest-er East, riding the elevator with her and never getting her name, Ben Montero decided to post about the experience on the UT Class of 2020 Face-book page, asking his peers for help in finding her. “Me as a person — I’m a very quirky guy,” said Monte-ro, a theater studies freshman. “I didn’t want them to think I was weird or something. I was like ‘I’m really curious who this girl is, so hopefully I’ll find her.’ My gut was telling me: Just do it.”These “missed connec-tions” posts have appeared multiple times on the Class of 2020 Facebook page, said Beth Waldman, communica-tions coordinator of Student Success Initiatives. Waldman, an administrator of the Class of 2020 Facebook page, said she also manages the pages for the other classes at UT but has only seen these kinds of posts with the current freshmen. “From what I have observed in the last three months, you know students are always making connections through the Facebook page, so I would say that ultimately it is a plat-form for (finding people),” Waldman said. “We’re hap-py to see people engaging with each other and trying to making friends.”Montero received more than 140 likes and 20 com-ments on his post, and even got messages from people living in Jester East offering to share his post in other groups. Although he never found the girl, Montero said he was hap-py with the positive response he received from his peers.Not everyone felt that way, however. Theater studies freshman Carrington Queza-da said she did not support his post and felt inclined to comment because she knew Montero personally. “It’s a case to case basis,” Quezada said. “I think that it’s kind of inappropriate be-cause if somebody called me out like that I would be un-comfortable because I feel like the person getting called out is more inclined to do some-thing they don’t want to do because they’re pressured by a whole student body of peo-ple who are like ‘aw, this is so cute!’”Mathematics freshman Abby Gail Trino had a similar experience to Mon-Freshmen use Facebook page to locate missed connectionsBy Rajya Atluri@rajyaatluriCAMPUSSeeking Arrangements site sweeps UT campusBy Albert Zhao@_albertzhaoSEEKING page 2WHAT’S  I N S I D ETexas lawmakers move to tackle mental illness PAGE 4OPINIONMatt Coleman signs  National Letter of Intent PAGE 6SPORTSSound and Sculpture combines art and music PAGE 8LIFE&ARTSCheck out our Support Student Voices campaign atdailytexanonline.comONLINEREASON TO PARTYPAGE 7By Kayla Meyertons@kemeyertonsBERRY page 2CONNECTION page 2Stephanie Martinez-Arndt | Daily Texan StaffMathematics freshman Abby Gail Trino is one of the many posting in the UT Class of 2020 Facebook Page about 2Main Telephone(512) 471-4591Editor-in-ChiefAlexander Chase(512) 232-2212editor@dailytexanonline.comManaging EditorAkshay Mirchandani(512) 232-2217managingeditor@dailytexanonline.comNews Office(512) 232-2207news@dailytexanonline.comSports Officesports@dailytexanonline.comLife & Arts Office(512) 232-2209lifeandarts@dailytexanon-line.comMultimedia Office(512) 471-7835multimedia@ dailytexanonline.comRetail Advertising(512) 471-1865advertise@texasstudentme-dia.comClassified Advertising(512) 471-5244classifieds@ dailytexanonline.comCONTACT USVolume 117, Issue 138TOMORROW’S WEATHERHigh Low80 63Maybe everCOPYRIGHTCopyright 2017 Texas Student Media.

I can only begin to fathom what her loss will be.”Proctor said Berry is one of eight honorary members of the Tejas Club,Orange Jackets President Beth-any Rolan, supply chain manage-ment and economics senior, said Berry was a well-known member of Orange Jackets. “She was so visible and so vital to campus,” Rolan said. “We’re looking forward to cele-brating her life and remember-ing her and taking a moment to just really think about ev-erything she did.”Rolan said Orange Jackets will be serving as hosts at her funeral service.  Will O’Hara, interim co-ex-ecutive director for Texas Exes, said he only met Berry once at a Tejas Club event.“I was aware at that time I was standing in front of a leg-end,” O’Hara said. “She was late nineties (and) still sharp as a tack ... We will remember her in a proper way because she meant so much to us. It was a real blow around here that she passed away.”O’Hara said Berry received Texas Exes’ highest honor, the Distinguished Alumni Award, in 1996 and has been a long-time member of the Texas Exes Scholarship Committee.Berry was also a longtime adviser to the Alpha Rho chap-ter of Alpha Phi Omega, the nation’s largest co-ed service fraternity. UT alumnus Robert Pennington, former president of Texas APO, said he became who he is today because of APO and advisers like Berry, who was consistently calm and insightful. “She made it safe to be vul-nerable (and) to talk about what was challenging,” Pen-nington said. “There are only a handful of people like that in our life that make a pro-found difference, and she was one of them.” UT alumna Mary Camer-on, member of the first co-ed APO pledge class in 1976, said Berry served as an unofficial historian to UT, authoring four books on its history in her life-time. Berry also served as asso-ciate dean of women in 1962. “She never married, (and) she didn’t have children of her own, so we all became her children.” Cameron said. “If anybody had orange blood, she did.” Berry was honored as the namesake of the ground floor atrium of the Student Activity Center in April 2012. The Mar-garet C. Berry scholarship was established in 1978 for out-standing sophomore women in Texas Orange Jackets.OBITUARYcontinues from page 1“It’s completely different,” Pack said. “The city of Los An-geles is a violent and dirty place. In LA, people would deal drugs right in front of me. After 28 years ... it was just time to go.”Pack said beside the lack of violent crime on cam-pus, the largest difference between LAPD and UTPD is the community’s attitude toward the police. “In LA, I’d say hi to some-one and they’d say, ‘Hey of-ficer, what’s going on?’ and here I say hi to someone and they’re shocked that I’m talking to them, they just keep on walking by,” Pack said. “It blew my mind when I came to campus.”While UT’s campus is con-siderably less violent than Los Angeles, Pack said some safety concerns remain universal. “The things I see in a big city, I also see students and faculty doing here, like walk-ing around (unaware of their surroundings),” Pack said. “Crime from the big city can still spill over into campus. It doesn’t matter where I go. I took this job because I enjoy preventing crime.”Unlike Pack and Murphy, Officer Michael Larner tran-sitioned to UTPD from with-in the city of Austin, begin-ning his career with UTPD five years ago after working for 25 years with the Austin Police Department.“You still have a lot of the same theft and crime that oc-curs with the big city, but you’re just (seeing) less of it here,” Larner said. “APD and UTPD are both challenging. You’re dealing with the same crime, just in a smaller capacity.”For officers transition-ing from bigger cities, it’s important to apply past ex-periences to campus polic-ing, Larner said. “We try to come in and give (UTPD) ideas and suggestions, and sometimes they work and sometimes they don’t,” Larner said. “You just have to bring in your experience and try to incorporate it in whatever way you can. In the end, it doesn’t matter what agency you go to, it’s just a different way of protecting and serving.”UTPDcontinues from page 1month during the bill’s commit-tee hearing. “It is a wonderful jewel that we have here in our state.” Patrick Newman, the execu-tive director of the Center, said the designation would help the Center spread its message of conservation and shed light on the important role of arbore-ta and botanic gardens across the state in conserving Texas’ floristic heritage.“The designation will help to elevate the Center’s critical mission of native plant conser-vation across Texas,” Newman said. “It clearly would enable us to recruit and retain talented staff and volunteers … and mar-keting the Center as the state’s botanic garden and arboretum will increase visitation to our physical location.” The 279 acre wildflower cen-ter has been affiliated with UT Austin since 2006 and is cur-rently a part of the School of Ar-chitecture. The Center supports a graduate studio for landscape architecture students who are working on master planning for the McDonald Observatory. Newman said the Center is also home to integrated biology fac-ulty research projects, including switchgrass and bees. “What we gain from our as-sociation with UT are a lot of really beneficial intangibles,” Newman said. “The ability to combine academic and applied research ... and the opportunity that we have to engage with our student body.” Stacey Kaleh, chief com-munications officer for the School of Architecture, said in a statement that the Center pro-vides students with experimen-tal research opportunities. The Center has also been a founda-tion for innovative and excit-ing projects, such as the Living Wall which opened last year, Kaleh said. “As a research unit of the School of Architecture, the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Cen-ter is a vital resource for our stu-dents and faculty,” Kaleh said in a statement. A final vote in the House on the bill could come as early as today.LADYBIRDcontinues from page 1tero last semester. She was in Kinsolving when she heard a boy playing a song she liked on the piano in the lobby. Trino half-jokingly offered to re-cord him and make CDs out of the songs he was playing. Their conversation got cut short when another girl start-ed playing the piano, and Tri-no never caught his name. “I was like, ‘You know what, this is so stupid and I’m prob-ably going to cringe about it later, but I’m going to try it out’ so I made the post,” Trino said. “I thought it would be cool if we became friends.”Trino decided to post on Facebook because she had seen other similar posts, like biology freshman Teresa Vu’s, which had the hashtag #Find-WaterBottleBoy2k16. Vu was looking for a wa-ter bottle at the College of Natural Sciences fair when a boy handed her his, which later encouraged her to try to find him.  “I just thought that was a small act of kindness,” Vu said.Ever since her post, Vu tries to support others with similar searches.“Every time someone posts something like that, I always support them,” Vu said. “It’d be a cute love story to tell your grandkids.”CONNECTIONS continues from page 1Seeking Arrangements public relations coordinator, said in an email that the site’s users are looking for mutually benefi-cial relationships and there are tools available like background checks to make them safe.  “Unfortunately, when some-one is off the site and in a rela-tionship, we as a dating site have no ability to intervene in person-al relationships,” D’Espyne said. “The site is simply a platform.”Alexis said she was content with the service because she had been selective with her cli-ents since sophomore year and never chose someone she did not feel attracted to. “You have to be forward and strong with your dating game,” Alexis said. “Otherwise it’s really easy to get mistreated by someone who is older and has money.”After depending on the service to pay the bills for a year and a half, Violet final-ly quit using the service. She said girls who depend on the service for a living suffer emotional costs and would require “a tough skin” to endure clients.“You’re not yourself when you’re doing it,” Violet said. “You have to be somebody else. It emotionally screws you up.”SEEKINGcontinues from page 1Infographic by Liza AndersonDaily Texan Staff2 Thursday, April 13, 2017 NEWS  Permanent StaffEditor-in-Chief . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Alexander ChaseAssociate Editors . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Zac CroffordName: 5412/Dancie Perugini Ware Publi; Width: 60p0; Depth: 20 in; Color: Black; Ad Number: 5412W&N 3NEWS Thursday, April 13, 2017 3Infographic by Liza AndersonDaily Texan StaffFortunately for Texans, our House of Representatives is avoiding the type of partisan bickering that plagues our na-tional government. In the wake of Pres-ident Donald Trump’s failed health care bill, House Speaker, Joe Straus, R-San An-tonio has made quiet progress on several mental health bills in Texas. If the House keeps up its streak of bipartisan progress and the Senate supports its efforts, Tex-ans could see improvements on one of our most pervasive problems.In Texas, “mental health disorders are the leading cause of disability” and ac-count for about 25 percent of potential years of life lost to illness. A startling 46 percent of people in the country have suf-fered from a mental health disorder. Yet in Texas, solving these issues has not been a top priority until recently. We owe the increased attention to mental health to Straus, who “gave the subject matter its due time and credit,” according to Rep. Joe Moody, D-El Paso.The House seeks to decrease the number of mental health disorders that go untreat-ed. Of the Americans with mental health disorders, only about 40 percent of them receive care. If 60 percent of people with sprained ankles limped around untreated, the state might have responded more swift-ly. Although insurance companies must legally cover mental health as they cover physical health, that standard is often not well-enforced. House Bill 10 would hold insurance com-panies accountable for covering mental health disorders as comprehensively as they cover other medical disorders by empower-ing the Texas Department of Insurance to more closely monitor healthcare plans. The bill’s author, Rep. Four Price, R-Am-arillo, promises the bill would also aid con-sumers who “are paying for coverage (but are) not able to access adequate treatment.”A strength of HB 10, which drew broad support in the House, is that it seeks struc-tural change and does not just throw mon-ey at the problem. Funneling money into a broken system has failed in the past, such as when an increase in funding did not de-crease the wait list of psychiatric patients in 2016.HB 10 shows that Texas lawmakers have learned from past failure and can unify across party lines for important issues.HB 11, which Straus has also priori-tized, would help diagnose mental health disorders at an earlier age and make men-tal health a more important component of health class curriculums in Texas schools.We cannot dismiss mental health disor-ders even though they manifest less visibly than other medical complications. Mental health disorders have been linked to approx-imately 90 percent of the 1.1 million suicides attempted annually. As rates of anxiety and depression rise among younger Americans, particularly college students, state governments must prioritize mental health. Fortunately, Joe Straus understands the severity of our mental health crisis. Texas voters should compel his fellow representatives to rally behind him.Marabella is a business honors, Plan II and Spanish freshman from Austin. When we got accepted at UT, we celebrated this occasion with our high school friends, made our parents proud, imagined our bright future — a future of our own choice. For those of us who came in undeclared, we got to know that there is another race: A race to get into your desired major. We started completing a bunch of prereq-uisites — series of calculus, physics etc. We must also hurry up because once we cross the 60-hour mark, many of UT’s colleges won’t accept us. And if by chance, we choose a wrong major, a major that didn’t turn out quite how we imagined, we are stuck in it for the rest of our college careers because that’s life.Most of the colleges at UT, including geosci-ences, engineering, architecture, fine arts and communications, have this rule. The main prob-lem is the mentality that a higher graduation rate equates to success. But school is not a factory. We must focus on making students good at what they want to do in future rather than pushing them to graduate in whatever comes their way. According to Maurie McInnis, Executive Vice President and Provost, the less-than-60-hour rule makes sure that students graduate in four years. This is partly because the longer the cur-rent students stay, the fewer new students can come in, and partly because it would be in their best interest to graduate in time so they can move on to the workforce. “The University, in part supported by tax payer’s dollars ... has limited capacity to educate students ... and we are trying to use them as effi-ciently for the students and for the state,” McIn-nis said. “Every year longer of education is more money (students) are spending on education and is a year that they are not in the workforce. For people who realize late in life that they have com-pletely changed their mind, they will usually fix that by going to graduate school.”David A. Laude, Sr. Vice Provost for strategic Initiatives, said that the students come prepared and the increased competition leaves very limit-ed seats for internal transfer students. The internal transfer competition is “on a certain level, unfortunate, but it is also the con-sequence of UT Austin having become an ex-tremely competitive, highly selective institution,” Laude says.It is understandable that the educational re-sources are limited. But these resources also come from the educational taxes that the families of Texas resident students have paid. It would be unfair for students to graduate in an undesired major, not because of a lack of effort, but because they are simply too late. Even the out-of-state stu-dents add on to these resources by paying three times more than Texas residents in tuition. Moreover, it is not feasible for many of us to fix our mistakes by going to graduate school — it is insanely expensive and we already have loans piling up. Harder internal transfer criteria such as higher GPA requirement or finishing more prerequisites are better than entirely closing the option to choose a certain major.  There are schools, such as business and nursing, that have some flexibility for students who have completed more than 60 hours. They recommend that students look for oth-er options if they are above the 90-hour mark, which is better. But if that is taken into consid-eration above other factors in the process, then it is no good either.The school administration is working hard for UT to be amongst the best institutions, and that is partly done by increasing the four-year gradu-ation rate. But we must decide as a university, that graduating in four years is not more important than graduating in a desired major with the read-iness to take on the world. Batra is computer science and rhetoric and writing junior from New Delhi. There’s been some degree of relief among liberals that the legacy of President Barack Obama is proving more difficult to disman-tle than many — including President Donald Trump — had anticipated. The Affordable Care Act, for the moment, remains the law of the land. The Iran nuclear deal has not been “torn up,” as Trump promised it would be. Obama’s historic measures to improve rela-tions with Cuba have not been undone.And both Trump and his recently confirmed Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, have publicly acknowledged that same-sex mar-riage, which was made legal by the nation’s highest court in 2015, is settled law. For some reason, they get credit for this. If a president were to begrudgingly admit that, say, desegre-gation was “settled law,” we’d likely be less than impressed. Worse still, if that president simul-taneously took actions to further disadvantage the very same people who were victims of seg-regation, we’d likely regard him as a cruel and disingenuous hack.So while Trump has reaped the benefits (such as they are) of being the most pro-LGBTQ Republican nominee in history, which is sort of like being the most pro-fish shark in history, his actions on LGBTQ rights are actu-ally an area where he’s been particularly suc-cessful at dismantling the Obama legacy.Two weeks ago, he rescinded an Obama ex-ecutive order that required firms doing busi-ness with the federal government to prove that they didn’t discriminate based on sexual orientation and gender identity. A previous executive order, requiring that firms con-tracted by the federal government not prac-tice such discrimination, remains in place, but companies no longer have to prove their compliance with it, which creates a loophole.Mark Green, Trump’s nominee to replace outgoing Army Secretary Eric Fanning — the first openly gay head of any U.S. military service — has alarmed LGBTQ advocacy groups. Last year Green said that “transgen-der is a disease” and suggested that supposed federal overreach on same-sex marriage and the rights of transgender people might lead to “civil disobedience” and armed insurrection.In February, the Trump administration or-dered the nation’s schools to disregard guide-lines issued by the Obama administration asserting the right of transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. Educa-tion Secretary Betsy DeVos said the issue was “best solved at the state and local level” — as if transgender students have different funda-mental human rights in Seattle than they do in South Dakota.Meanwhile, at the state and local level, as-saults on LGBTQ rights continue with radio silence from the Trump administration. In March, the North Carolina legislature passed a “repeal” of the state’s notorious anti-LGBTQ law that left in place many of the law’s dis-criminatory measures. Here in Texas, a bill that would let county clerks refuse to issue same-sex marriage licenses is making its way through the Senate.Unlike his hero Andrew Jackson, whose painting hangs prominently in the Oval Office, Trump has yet to defy the Supreme Court outright — nor is he likely to, for what it’s worth. But the president once promised to do “everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and op-pression of a hateful foreign ideology,” and while he pronounced “LGBTQ” like he was ordering a sandwich, you could be forgiven for thinking that he meant it. Alas, it seems hateful domestic ideologies are another mat-ter entirely for this president.Groves is a government sophomore from Dallas.4 OPINION4ALEXANDER CHASE, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF | @TexanEditorialMonday, April 13, 2017LEGALESE | Opinions expressed in The Daily Texan are those of the editor, the Editorial Board or the writer of the article.

Infographic by Liza AndersonDaily Texan StaffOklahoma series, now they will travel to Lubbock for their third Big 12 matchup against Texas Tech. Texas currently leads the series all-time 36-10, boast-ing a 16-4 record in Lub-bock. While the odds are historically on their side, the Longhorns are still looking to overcome barriers that prevent them from closing out games.“The little things I would say are just seeing the ball all the way to the gloves,” Han-zel said. “And getting those timely hits, pitchers getting the pitches. Baserunning as well, people don’t really think about that, but I think baserunning is one of the big things.The fundamentals are important. The lack of com-munication in the outfield showed on Friday against the Sooners, where the Long-horns saw one collision and many near-collisions. Balls skimmed the gloves of the defense, allowing runners on base. And offensive pro-duction shows inconsisten-cy, but when the production is there, the Longhorns see trouble rounding the bases. But it’s still early in con-ference play and the Long-horns have time to make some changes. “It’s about us,” Clark said. “Yeah, there’s another series, but it doesn’t matter who is wearing the other shirt. It’s about what we’re doing and how we’re playing, what our mental approach is like and how we’re executing.”that friendship and get to play ball on the field every-day — you’ll remember that for the rest of your life.” McCann wasn’t the only one who went through hardship after his depar-ture. He said his decision was tough for his entire family. It was hard for his mother, especially. “That was very difficult for us as parents because he’s played baseball since he was four years old,” McCann’s mother said. “It was hard on him, but it was hard on us as well because we missed it and it was something that has always been a part of our lives. So when it wasn’t for a little bit we were kind of at a loss.”It’s just been a year since McCann’s departure, but things have changed quite a bit since then. The catcher re-turned to the roster as a red-shirt sophomore after taking a year off, and he did it with a bang. McCann went in Tuesday night’s matchup with Texas State batting .359 – the high-est on the team. This forced head coach David Pierce to reward him with playing time, which is something most people, including his mother, weren’t sure how much to expect. “Initially he didn’t get a lot of play time but he kind of worked his way into prov-ing himself and getting to go out there more mainly because of his batting,” Mc-Cann’s mother said. “It was very exciting to see him back on the field and be more involved than he was in his freshman year.” As the Longhorns head into a three-game series with Baylor starting Thursday night, McCann continues to rewrite his story. And it’s fair to say that nobody is quite as happy as his mother, who was one of the first people he talked to after his first start of the season in Texas’ 6-1 victory over Rice on Feb. 18. “I walked right up to her,” McCann said. “I said, ‘Mom, it only took me two and a half years to get back here in this spot, but it finally happened.’”Name: CLASSIFIEDS; Width: 60p0; Depth: 10 in; Color: Black; Ad Number: -MEDICALDonate Sperm, Get Paid!Healthy men, age 18-39apply atCLINICAL RESEARCH COORDINATORCandidate with prior experience as a clinical research coordinator or academic experience as a research assistant needed to join our clinical research team at Red Oak Psychiatry Associates in Houston, TX.

We feel like Jar-rett is a really, really good testament to what happens if you come in here and you work hard, you devel-op, you grow, you follow our plan.”While Wednesday might have been a bit of a refresh-ing day for the program, Smart still was inevitably asked about last season, the worst since 1982-83. It’s been five weeks since Texas’ loss to West Virginia at the Big 12 Tournament ended the season. Smart says he’s been watching old games in re-verse order and taking notes on where there needs to be improvement.“As soon as the season gets done, it’s about how can we help these guys move for-ward,” Smart said. “What you don’t want to do is just flush the season down the toilet. As much as some of those guys might have wanted to do that, you got to get up close and personal with it and learn from it.”SMARTcontinues from page 8SPORTS Thursday, April 13, 2017 7Sophomore centerfielder Reagan Hathaway was lying down in the outfield, hold-ing her right knee in pain at the top of the third inning during last Friday’s matchup against Oklahoma. Hathaway collided with senior first baseman Kel-li Hanzel trying to catch a ball in the outfield, and now she’s out for the season with a torn ACL. Hathaway is a huge loss to the Texas of-fense, standing as the No. 3 hitter in the batting lineup. She currently leads the Big 12 in triples and holds the second most home runs and RBI’s for the Longhorns.But Hathaway’s injury is just another thing gone wrong for the Longhorns this season. Freshman sec-ond baseman Jade Gortarez is also struggling with a foot injury, making her question-able from game to game. And the losses have been piling up. In its first two Big 12 se-ries, Texas has lost every single game. The Longhorns dropped every game to Oklahoma State by one run, and after battling close with the Sooners in game one, the Longhorns lost 3-1, 6-0 in the following games. “I think we need to find a way to have some takeaways from it,” head coach Connie Clark said. “You have to find the good and the low points.”The Longhorns have had a full week to recover from the Name: 5347/South Texas College of Law; Width: 29p6; Depth: 10 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 53476TYLER HORKA, SPORTS EDITOR | @texansportsThursday, April 13, 2017SIDELINE BASEBALLMcCann makes resurgent return to Texas By Alex Briseno@AlexxbrisenoJoshua Guerra | Daily Texan StaffAfter leaving the baseball program in 2015, redshirt sophomore catcher Michael McCann has returned to lead the team in batting average.

That’s why it was such a surprise when the redshirt sophomore hung his cleats up and walked away from the diamond after just one season on the 40 Acres. The catcher from Round Rock, Texas, played behind junior Michael Cantu for the majority of their freshman years. McCann only saw the field a mere five games in 2015 before making his decision to leave the pro-gram at the conclusion of his freshman year. “The biggest reason for my departure was probably that I had no love for the game anymore,” McCann said. “I think, honestly, not that I didn’t play enough but just sitting in the dugout kind of really got to me.”Last season, McCann’s name vanished from the ros-ter. However, it didn’t take long for him to not only miss the game, but his teammates as well.“I would turn on the TV, turn on Longhorn Network and watch the game,” Mc-Cann said. “I missed the game itself, yes, but mostly the guys.

Another handful of burnt orange faithful watched from outside the fenced area, hoping to see their Longhorns take down No. 4 Baylor. But the Bears proved to be a handful, overpower-ing Texas for a 4-1 win.The Longhorns’ sea-son-long struggles in doubles play continued as Baylor won the first two matches 6-3, 6-2.“We had a terrible start in doubles,” head coach Michael Center said. “That set the tone and really put us in a hole, so I was pretty disappointed.”The Bears stayed on the attack in singles play. Bay-lor’s Max Tchoutakian ex-tended the lead to 2-0 with a 6-3, 6-1 win over freshman Christian Sigsgaard.“Baylor always plays ag-gressive,” Center said. “We weren’t able to execute on some of the big points, so it just felt like we were fighting an uphill battle the whole night.”Senior George Goldhoff brought some life to the Longhorns, besting Bay-lor’s Will Little 6-1, 7-5 to make it a 2-1 score.The Bears responded, crushing all hopes of a comeback by winning the final two singles match-es for a 4-1 win. The loss serves as a reminder to Texas that there’s room for improvement before entering postseason play in May.“We didn’t play well enough to win,” Center said. “But we have a lot of tennis ahead of us. We just have to play a lot bet-ter overall if we’re going to beat some of the top teams like Baylor.”The Longhorns face a quick turnaround as they play host to Texas Tech on Saturday at Caswell.“Our guys are pretty dis-appointed with the loss, but we’ll be ready to play on Saturday,” Center said. “That’s for sure.”               —Justin MartinezSPORTS BRIEFLYNFLFALCONS21COLTS24Head coach Shaka Smart walked into his press con-ference Wednesday af-ternoon nearly 10 min-utes late — but it was for good reason.“Sorry I’m a little bit late,” Smart said. “I was ac-tually on the phone with a recruit.”It’s that time of year again for college basketball coach-es around the country as Wednesday marked the first day of the spring signing period for recruits.Wednesday’s press con-ference came directly on the heels of some important news surrounding the pro-gram. The school announced Tuesday night that freshman forward and NBA Draft prospect Jarrett Allen will hire an agent and not return to Texas.Four-star point guard Matt Coleman of Oak Hill Academy (Virginia) signed his national letter of intent Wednesday morning. Cole-man, who Smart has recruit-ed since middle school, is widely considered to be the true floor general that Texas is missing.“Matt Coleman is a pure point guard,” Smart said. “He orchestrates offense, he gets other guys shots, he makes everyone around him better ... He’s always been beyond his years in the way that he plays. He’s just gotten better and better over the years.”The official addition of Coleman gives the Long-horns four signees in their 2017 recruiting class, which currently is ranked No. 6 in the nation by 247Sports.Texas’ 2017 class also includes four-star shooting guard Jase Febres of Westfield High School (Houston), four-star pow-er forward Royce Hamm of Aldine Davis High School (Houston) and four-star power forward Jericho Sims of Cristo Rey Jesuit High School (Minnesota). Smart said he’s not done recruiting yet for this year’s class and that there could be more players on the way to Austin with three scholarships still available.One of Smart’s main objectives moving for-ward is luring the prized No. 3 player in the nation, five-star power forward Mohamed Bamba, to Tex-as. Bamba, a Westtown School (New York City) product, also holds offers from Kentucky and Duke. Bamba was on the Team USA under-18 national team last summer, which was coached by Smart, along with Allen, Cole-man and freshman center James Banks.Smart could not com-ment on Bamba Wednes-day due to NCAA rules prohibiting coaches from talking about any recruits who are unsigned. But Smart did say he is still looking to fill the hole Allen left.SMART page 5We’re looking for a big that can really fit who we want to be on and off the court.

Texas Performing Arts has partnered with Land-marks, UT’s public art pro-gram, the college of fine arts and the school of music to showcase students’ mu-sical compositions inspired by public art around cam-pus. On Thursday at 6:30 p.m., the public will get the chance to hear these works during the third annual Sound in Sculpture con-cert, which will take place at and focus on art pieces around the Health Learn-ing Building of the Dell Medical School. “We are used to listen-ing to music in a concert hall, (and) to viewing art in a certain setting,” said Tim Rogers, Student En-gagement Coordinator for Texas Performing Arts. “We thought we could gain something by having the music performed right next to the work of art.” The event, Rogers said, will be structured so the artists will be located next to the art. Guests will be asked to move from one piece to the next to hear compositions. “It is lots of different takes on the music,” Rog-ers said. “Even if you are looking at the same thing, everyone has a different perspective on what that might inspire.”Musical composition sophomore Jessica Eu-banks said she decided to create a piece for concert after being inspired by the art piece One Every-one by Ann Hamilton. She said she felt compelled by the way the photographs portray touch while the images themselves are art that can be only be seen and not touched.Eubanks said she had to come up with a set of themes the piece rep-resents for her, such as a collective unity, touch and physical care. “It is sort of a musi-cal metaphor for the way that we are different,” Eubanks said. “Each in-strument uses itself to show how people are different, but we also come together and play at the same time.” For music composition senior Ben Stevenson and graduate composition stu-dent Grace Ma, the magni-tude of the Spiral of the Gal-axy piece by Marc Quinn and its relationship with the original shell became the inspiration for their works. Stevenson said for one of his pieces, he chan-neled the delicate sound of the ocean the original shell could provide. “It brings back the  nos-talgia of being at the beach and how you can kind of take this immense, unman-ageable ocean and bring-ing it to this small form,” Stevenson said. In an effort to inte-grate her childhood love for science and mathematics with her passion for music com-position, Ma based her composition on a trian-gular number sequence she created. Her piece, titled Quintuple He-lix, draws upon a DNA relationship between the metal shell and the real one. “I am also very inspired by (how) he 3D print-ed from an actual conch shell,” Ma said. “That is something you can hold in your palm, and now it is this huge bronze thing that is sitting in the middle of the urban landscape, being very much part of it rath-er than something you can pick off the beach, handle in your palm.” When Stevenson found out others were also using the Spiral of the Galaxy, he said he planned to pick an-other piece to maintain va-riety but said later thought it was more important to reflect the different views each of them had about the same work.“It is really interesting how we have all present-ed a completely different perspective on this one piece of art,” Stevenson said. “That is the purpose of the Landmarks proj-ect — to have people in-terpret the art in new and different ways.”Four months after closing his first restaurant, the Re-public of Sandwich, Thomas Gardner has resurrected his business in the form of Capi-tol Sandwich food truck. “This neighborhood we were in was really support-ive of the old sandwich shop and I hated leaving it be-cause I got to know a lot of people around here,” Gard-ner said. “I would even get personal messages from my old customers asking when we were going to bring our food back.”The idea of running a sandwich shop was born out of Gardner’s life-long fascination with preparing meat. “A natural outlet for that is to either open a butch-er shop or a sandwich shop,” Gardner said. “I fig-ured Austin was lacking in good sandwiches.”Gardner said although Austin‘s sandwich scene doesn’t seem to be on par yet with other cities in that regard, especially East Coast cities. Capitol Sandwich takes the time to hand cure and smoke all of its meat in house, unlike other shops around town. Gardner also makes it a point of giving customers enough meat in their sandwiches to put their hunger to rest. “I want to give people a quality product at a good price and also make sure people leave very full af-ter eating their sandwich,” Gardner said. “A lot of these places that bill themselves as artisan or craft sandwiches, you pay a high price for it and you get your sandwich and there just isn’t that much meat in it, which isn’t fair to the customers.”Capitol of Sandwich more than meets its two goals of providing quality sandwiches that will have people walking away with a big ole’ gut. The sandwiches are generously stuffed with copious amounts of meats, cheeses and veggies. Each ingredient listed on the menu shines clearly on its respective sandwich. One of the most commonly ordered sandwiches, the Big Bad Wolf, combines a formidable trio of pulled pork, bacon and ham with some melted provolone and a satisfyingly creamy topping of coleslaw. It’s like a barbecue sandwich on steroids. While this sandwich will undoubtedly be too heavy for some patrons, the quali-ty of the meat is still worth praising. The smoked ham in particular goes far beyond the basic saltiness of coun-try ham with a delicious mixture of sugar, spices and herbs crusting its outer ring. It’s a daunting sand-wich, but meat lovers will be exceptionally satisfied by its execution. A good foil to the heavi-ness of the Big Bad Wolf is the Jive Turkey — a cold sandwich option with turkey, pesto, cherry peppers, toma-to and pepper jack cheese. While still stuffed with an abundance of its respective ingredients, it’s still a much lighter sandwich that won’t leave customers wheezing as they walk to their cars. Being a light sandwich doesn’t detract from the amount of flavor it delivers, though. The pesto, cherry peppers and tomato come together to yield a won-derfully tangy taste with the perfect hint of spice to satisfy a Texas palate. Most of the sides offered at Capitol Sandwich are chips like at any other sand-wich shop, but with one exception: kimchi sprouts. This side is a basic combi-nation of sauteed brussel sprouts smothered in house-made kimchi, but the result of the mixture makes for a truly memorable side. With a substantial amount of chili flakes mixed in, the kim-chi on this dish delivers an impressive amount of spice that blends perfectly well with the slight bitterness of the brussel sprouts. It’s defi-nitely worth ordering over the chips. Capitol of Sandwich does a great job of offering ex-citing takes on traditional sandwiches, and although the $9-$10 price range isn’t cheap, the quality of the in-gredients is well worth the extra money.Name: 5665/Kunik Orthodontics; Width: 19p4; Depth: 4 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 5665Name: 5645/Clements Center for Nation; Width: 19p4; Depth: 4 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 5645Name: 5678/House Ads; Width: 60p0; Depth: 2 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 56788 L&AMAE HAMILTON, LIFE&ARTS EDITOR | @thedailytexan 8Thursday, April 13, 2017FOODBy Stephen Acevedo@thedailytexanBrooke Crim | Daily Texan StaffCapitol Sandwich owner and chef Thomas Gardner makes a variety of hearty meat sandwiches.
