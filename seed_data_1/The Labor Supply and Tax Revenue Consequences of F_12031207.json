February 2012 08:59 UTCThe Labor Supply and Tax Revenue Consequencesof Federal Same-Sex Marriage LegalizationAdam Stevenson∗January 4, 2012AbstractThe issue of same-sex marriage legalization is increasingly part of the nationalpolitical dialogue. This legalization would have a number of economic impacts, oneof the most direct being a change in income tax payments, through the so-calledmarriage penalty. I estimate the effects of same-sex marriage legalization on federalincome tax revenue. These estimates rely critically on the responsiveness of laborsupply and marital choice to changes in the tax code. I present new evidence onboth topics using changes in taxation generated from the 2003 Jobs and Growth TaxRelief Reconciliation Act. In addition, I propose a novel measure of the marriagepenalty that incorporates the fact that agents will respond optimally to changes inmarginal tax rates within the household.JEL classifications: D10, H24, J12, J22keywords: labor supply, marriage penalty, sexual orientation, DOMA∗Department of Economics, University of Michigan11 IntroductionThe debate over whether same-sex couples should be allowed the legal right to marryhas become a hot-button issue in the United States in the last decade. The Defenseof Marriage Act (DOMA) prohibits the recognition of same-sex marriage at the federallevel, but a growing number of states and major cities have granted the right to eithermarry or enter into other officially-recognized relationships.1 DOMA also allows statesto disregard same-sex marriages granted in other states. While state- and local-levelrecognition can have profound social effects, the economic effects of federal recognition ofsame-sex marriage are potentially quite important. Changes in this arena are occurringat the federal level - President Obama recently ordered the Justice Department to ceasedefense of DOMA (Savage 2011). In this paper, I explore the effects of same-sex marriagelegalization on federal income tax revenue.Same-sex marriage legalization has the direct impact of allowing a change in a house-hold’s legal tax filing status, which can change the household’s income tax burden, viathe “marriage penalty” (which may be positive, a tax, or negative, a subsidy). Thischange in the tax schedule causes a change in labor supply, which also affects income taxrevenue. Further, the desire to capture a marriage subsidy or avoid a marriage tax maycause marriage rates to vary along with the marriage penalty. To fully understand theeffect of same-sex marriage legalization on income tax collection, we must understand thedistribution of marriage penalties across same-sex households, the causal effect of thesepenalties on marriage likelihood, and how this change in taxation influences labor supplychoices.To capture both of these effects, I introduce a new measure of the marriage penalty,which I call the endogenous marriage penalty.2 Changes in the tax schedule upon mar-riage will change incentives to work for both partners within a household. This in turnchanges hours worked and further changes the tax rate. I estimate the marriage penalty1These relationships are often called “civil unions”, but different constituencies offer legal statuses thatprovide differing degrees of comparability to the state of marriage. Civil unions are similar to marriage,offering the same legal rights. Other legal statuses offering fewer and weaker legal rights include domesticpartnerships or reciprocal/designated beneficiaries (Hawkins 2009, Badgett, Gates and Maisel 2008).2Sjoquist and Walker (1995) have estimated marriage penalties at the aggregate level assuming thatlabor market choices differ between married and non-married cohabiting couples (finding little evidenceof aggregate changes), but I’m not aware of any paper that estimates the behavioral response frommicrodata.2as a function of rational responses to anticipated changes in both the worker’s own taxrate and their partner’s, conditional on whether or not the couple is legally married. Thisendogenous marriage penalty is in contrast to the standard measure, which does not allowfor labor market responses to tax changes and as such may be interpreted as an “instan-taneous” measure. I provide a decomposition to illustrate the sources of the discrepancybetween the instantaneous measure of the marriage penalty and the endogenous measure.The question of the tax revenue consequences of same-sex marriage is not an idleone. Both the federal and a number of state governments have explicitly justified theirsame-sex marriage bans on the basis of the adverse tax revenue and expenditure effects(Hawkins 2009). In terms of measuring the tax revenue consequences of legalizing same-sex marriage, the paper that comes closest to this one is Alm, Badgett, and Whittington(2000), which is not based on micro-level income data but instead uses estimates ofmean earnings from other papers and imposes varying assumptions about gay and lesbianhousehold composition to tabulate a range of potential aggregate outcomes. The mostsystematic investigation of the net budgetary effects of same-sex marriage legalizationis from the CBO (2004). It estimates an almost $1 billion annual budget windfall tolegalization, $200-$400 million of which come from income tax revenues. The CBO’sestimates of same-sex marriage penalties draw heavily on Alm, Badgett, and Whittington(2000).I show that same-sex marriage legalization would increase federal income tax revenuessomewhere between $100 and $175 million. Given the existing estimates of the increase infederal costs that would accompany legalization (CBO 2004), the policy at worst wouldbe revenue-neutral, and, at the upper range of my estimates, may generate $140 millionper year.The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) of 2003, an accel-eration of the 2001 Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA)(together frequently called the “Bush tax cuts”) provides a useful natural experiment.3The Bush tax cuts implemented a number of reforms, but two primary changes were ageneral tax cut and a decrease in the average marriage penalty. The JGTRRA in par-ticular served as an exogenous tax shock. The EGTRRA scheduled a slow phase-in of3Keifer eta˙l(˙2002) provides a detailed description of the EGTRRA.3marriage penalty reforms and tax bracket adjustments, but the JGTRRA abruptly im-plemented all the planned income tax changes starting in tax year 2003. These cuts, themost substantial tax reforms in the U.S. of the last 15 years, have not been exploited asa source of variation in the question of household structure, and have only rarely beenused in studies of labor supply choice (Heim 2009, Auten, Carroll, and Gee 2008).The JGTRRA grants us the ability to make a number of methodological improvementsto the previous literature. While a number of papers (described in section 4.2) haveconsidered the effect of the marriage penalty on marriage likelihood, none to my knowledgehave used a single, large, unanticipated cut to identify the effect. In combination withgeneralized propensity score methods (Hirano and Imbens 2005), I use the JGTRRAto construct novel estimates of the sensitivity of marriage to taxation. Similarly, whilea small number of papers have studied the labor supply of same-sex couples, few havebased their estimates on plausibly-exogenous shocks to net wages.42 Data and Descriptive StatisticsThe main sources of data for this study are the U.S. Census 1% sample from the year 2000,and the American Community Survey from years 2001-2007, as prepared by the IPUMSproject (Ruggles eta˙l2˙010). I restrict the data to the time period 2000 to 2007 to include4 years of data before and after the implementation of the JGTRRA while excluding theinfluence of other tax reforms (in particular the substantial Economic Stimulus Act of2008). Following the literature on familial labor supply at prime working age, I dropall households where either member is older than 54, or where the head or partner islikely to be too young to participate in the labor market (Blau and Kahn 2007).5 I usea 1% random sample of heterosexual households from the 2000 Census and a 2% samplefrom the ACS surveys so that my samples of heterosexual and homosexual couples are ofcomparable size in most years.Since the Census surveys do not ask any questions about sexual behavior or identity,the only way to identify homosexuals in the data is through cohabitation and reported4Antecol and Steinberger (2011) is the main exception, using an instrumental variable methodologyvery similar to my own, but considering only lesbian women, and only in a single cross-section.5I definite potential experience as age - 6 - years of education, and drop households where one memberhas negative potential experience.4relationship status. There are well-documented problems with the Census relational data.Black, Gates, Sanders and Taylor (2007) point out that the sample of same-sex couplesin the 2000 Census is substantially contaminated by mis-allocated individual gender orrelationship status. The Census Bureau treats identification as a spouse or being in thestate of marriage as logically inconsistent with being in a same-sex relationship. It re-codeseither the gender or relationship status of a large number of individuals, creating a largenumber of “false positive” homosexual couples within the data. I define a gay or lesbiancouple to be a pair of individuals of the same sex who live in the same household, and wherethe respondent classifies the other individual as an “unmarried parter.” Following thestandard response to this problem, I omit from the sample all individuals with allocatedgender or marital status.Standard theory says that labor supply choices are made in response to marginalwage rates. I calculate gross wage w by taking annual labor market earnings and dividingby annual hours worked, as calculated from typical weekly hours worked times weeksworked in the year. Following the literature, I drop individuals with “extreme” impliedwage rates, below $2 and above $200, as measured in 2004 real dollars (Blau and Kahn2007). A worker’s marginal wage is w ∗ (1 − µ), where µ represents the federal incometax rate, including the employee’s share of the payroll (FICA) tax. Since primary earnersoverwhelmingly participate in the market, I drop all households where the primary earnerhas zero reported hours worked in the year.Tax data comes from NBER’s TAXSIM program (Feenberg and Couts 1993). Thesevariables include total federal income tax and FICA contributions. Since my tax data isgenerated by TAXSIM, it is not true taxes paid, but predicted taxes based on observabledata within the Census.6 Potentially important variables not found in the Census includecapital gains income and expenditures on child care, health care, mortgage interest andcharitable donations.Table 1 describes the characteristics of household members within the sample. Whenstudying household income and specialization, it’s useful to differentiate between primaryand secondary earners (Antecol and Steinberger 2011). Most theoretical and empirical6These tax-relevant data include the number of children (by age group), labor and business income,interest and dividend income, social security income, pension income, and payments made for rent orproperty tax. These data are all arguments of the tax function defined in section 3.5approaches treat the male as the primary earner in heterosexual households. I definethe primary earner in homosexual households to be the member whose annual incomeis greater. In table 1 I separately describe male and female members of heterosexualhouseholds and primary and secondary earners in homosexual households.The sample of gay and lesbian households is slightly younger than the married hetero-sexual couples, but older than the unmarried heterosexual households. Consistent withBlack, Sanders and Taylor (2007), individuals in homosexual households have substan-tially fewer children and much more education than those in heterosexual households.Interestingly, in terms of education and wage rates, homosexual households are morespecialized (along the dimension of market versus non-market human capital) than areheterosexual husbands and wives. Married men and women have identical average lev-els of education, and among those who work, married women earn about 71% of theirspouse’s wages, while gay secondary earners have 0.7 fewer years of education and medianwages that are 52% of the primary earners’.7 The household wage gap is smaller in lesbianhouseholds than in gay households, but greater than in married households.3 Marriage and taxesThe first step towards estimating the effects of taxes on household status and labor supplyis to measure the marriage penalty, which involves calculating actual and counterfactualtax burdens. These calculations allow me to estimate, first, marriage rates as a functionof the tax treatment of marriage, and second, the change in the marginal tax rate due tomarriage.In principle, it is simple to define actual and counterfactual taxes, and therefore themarriage penalty. For any pair of individuals (following the notation of Berliant andRothstein (2003)), define each individual’s income tax liability when single as T st (ye),where ye indicates the vector of taxable income streams (and offsetting expenditures andcharacteristics) for earner e ∈ {1, 2} and where T st (·) is a function representing the federaltax schedule for unmarried persons in year t. If two individuals marry, the tax liability is7Of course, since married women are less likely to work than secondary-earner homosexuals, those mar-ried women who are in the labor force are a relatively more select group than are homosexual secondaryearners.6Tmt (y1, y2), where Tmt (·, ·) is a function representing the federal tax schedule for marriedcouples in year t. The marriage penalty P is the increase in taxes when a household oftwo single individuals instantaneously enter into the state of marriage,Pt(y1, y2) ≡ Tmt (y1, y2)− (T st (y1) + T st (y2)) . (1)Clearly, when Pt(y1, y2) < 0, there is a negative marriage penalty, or a marriage sub-sidy. Since the ye vectors are assumed fixed with respect to marital status, this calculationrules out the possibility of economies of household scale, for example in terms of rent orproperty taxes. Suppose that the first element of ye is labor market income, denotedyLe . Typically, this value is also fixed in equation 1. If so, the measured penalty is bestinterpreted as an instantaneous change in tax burden among the partners, before anyeconomic responses to the change in martial status can occur.Given the data in the Census, calculating Tmt (y1, y2) is simple, since the federal taxschedule pools non-labor income and children within married households. It is less simpleto calculate counterfactual taxes for married couples (i.e., as if they were unmarried).Many assets in married households are pooled, making a clean distinction between eachmember’s non-labor income difficult. Even if the asset holdings of each spouse were clearlydelineated, the assets are unlikely to be split according to these divisions in divorce pro-ceedings. Taxes if single are calculated, following the literature, as if a “divorce” and asplit of assets occurred, under the assumption that households minimize total tax lability(Feenberg and Rosen 1994). This method dictates that unmarried couples (whether ac-tual or counterfactually divorced) will equally split all non-work income between the twomembers.Children are a major tax deduction, and we must determine which parent is assignedcustody of each child when a couple is unmarried. The standard tax-minimization algo-rithm assigns all child deductions to the higher earner. This implies that the higher earnerwill take any non-biological children (i.e., the partner’s child from a different relationship)into their household after divorce.8 This is an unappealing assumption, especially among8Another popular method for penalty calculations involves assigning children to the woman, as typ-ically occurs in divorce settlements. This procedure provides no guidance, however, for homosexualhouseholds. Alm and Whittington (1996) explore the consequences of the opposing methods for allocat-ing tax deductions. They show that while the different methods imply different marriage penalties, the7same-sex couples, where there simply cannot be shared biological children. I assign chil-dren to parents upon divorce in the following way. Parents always claim a child who istheirs and who is not the biological child of their partner. Shared biological children areassigned to the higher earner. Individuals with no children file as single while individualswith children file as head of household.Figure 1 shows that there is a clear level shift in the average marriage penalty after2003. The average size of this shift is essentially neutral with respect to martial statusand sexual orientation. Figure 1 aggregates across the child groups described in table 2and shows that there is no substantial time trend in marriage penalties before or afterthe JGTRRA. For every coresidency type, the fall in the average marriage penalty is onthe order of $1000.9Figure 2 illustrates that all four coresidency types became more likely to draw amarriage penalty of zero after the JGTRRA (shown in grey) than before (shown in blackoutline). For all groups, the modal outcome was to pay a small marriage penalty prior tothe reforms, and to pay nothing afterwards.Table 2 presents tax liability and marriage penalty statistics, by coresidency, priorto and after the implementation of the JGTRRA. I also separate the statistics by thenumber of children in the household. Homosexual couples are particularly likely to haveno children, and we want to compare them to similar heterosexual couples in this regard.In terms of changes in actual tax lability, childless gay and lesbian couples experiencedthe largest average tax cuts of all groups, an average income tax cut of 8.5% for childlesslesbian women, 6.1% for childless gay men. Similarly, the majority of heterosexual marriedcouples with children paid a marriage penalty both before and after the reform, while themajority of homosexual couples (regardless of the presence of children) do not.Treating the marriage penalty as a lump-sum payment as in equation 1 is useful inthinking about the economic incentive to marry. But in terms of labor supply choices,we typically want to know how marginal tax rates will change upon marriage. Here andthroughout the paper, when I calculate individual marginal tax rates when married, Iassume the primary earner is taxed first, starting at the lower marginal rates. Secondarytime trends and year-over-year changes across methods of calculation are virtually identical.9I use the term ‘coresidency type” to differentiate between individuals living together in heterosexualmarried, heterosexual unmarried, gay male and lesbian female households.8earners (by definition of being secondary) take the primary earner’s income as given and soare taxed as if their first dollar is the primary earner’s last dollar.10 It always holds, then,that for marginal labor income tax rates,∂Tmt∂yL1≤ ∂Tmt∂yL2. Among the unmarried, typically∂T st∂yL1≥ ∂T st∂yL2(since the prime earner typically earns more than the secondary earner, thoughthis is not true in all heterosexual unmarried households). Holding constant all otherelements of the ye vectors, the more specialized a household is in terms of labor marketearnings, the more the prime earner’s tax rate will fall upon marriage and the morethe secondary earner’s will rise upon marriage (Eissa and Hoynes 2000). The effects ofmarriage on incentive to work will therefore differ across coresidency and earner type,depending on these factors.As seen in table 3, each worker type experienced a marginal tax rate cut in 2003,ranging from 1.3 percentage points for secondary-earning gay men to 2.3 percentage pointsfor unmarried heterosexual women. I define the “rate marriage penalty” to be the increasein marginal tax rates experienced by an individual when they enter into marriage,∂Tmt∂yLe−∂T st∂yLe. These penalties are calculated assuming no labor market response to any tax schedulechanges that occur upon marriage.For every coresidency type, the marginal tax rate for primary earners always fallsupon marriage and the rate for secondary earners rises.More interesting are the differencesacross coresidency types. Since married couples are relatively specialized in terms of labormarket effort, married women would pay relatively low tax rates if unmarried and highrates if married. As we’ll see again in section 4.1.1, homosexual secondary earners are moresimilar to unmarried women than to married women in terms of labor market outcomes.Homosexual rate marriage penalties are significantly lower than married women’s, butare statistically indistinguishable from heterosexual unmarried couples. The Bush taxreforms lowered the rate penalties for every coresidency type except unmarried couples,with married women and secondary-earning gay men experiencing the biggest decreasesin rate marriage penalties.10The labor supply estimation results for married men and women are insensitive to the use of thisrate, rather than applying the pooled top marginal rate to both members of the household.94 Empirical Results4.1 Labor supplyThere is a very large literature studying the effects of taxation on household labor supplychoices. The methodology often takes the form of instrumental variables (IV) estimates(Mroz (1987) surveys the early literature in this vein).11 Recent contributions to theliterature using instruments similar to my own include Devereaux (2004), Blau and Kahn(2007), and Antecol and Steinberger (2011), with this last paper focusing in particularon lesbian households. Orrefice (2011), Leppel (2007) and Tebaldi and Elmslie (2006) allstudy differences in labor supply choices by sexual orientation, but do not use exogenousnet wage variation as a source of identification.In this section, I estimate the labor supply function (in the form of an hours equation)by coresidency type and primary/secondary worker status in section 4.1.1.12 Using thoseestimates, in section 4.1.2 I introduce an alternative measure of the marriage penalty, the“endogenous” penalty, which allows individuals to make optimal labor market responsesin response to the shift in tax schedule that occurs upon marriage or divorce.4.1.1 IV estimates of own- and partner-wage effectsSuppose that the worker’s labor supply function is given by the equationhicet = α1ce lnwoicet + α2ce lnwpicet + α3ceIict + βceXicet + εicet , (2)where i indexes households across coresidency types c, earner types (primary or secondary)e , and time periods t. Letting w measure the net-of-taxes marginal wage, annual hoursworked h is a function of (the log of) both the individual’s own wage, wo, and theirpartner’s, wp. Iict measures the household’s non-labor market income, and Xicet is a vectorof individual and household characteristics.13 I do not include indicators for educationalattainment (education is one of my grouping instruments), and so the α1ce coefficient is11Simple difference-in-difference estimates are also widely used in the literature, as in Eissa (1995),LaLumia (2009), and Crossley and Jeon (2007).12I use the term ‘coresidency type” to differentiate between individuals living together in heterosexualmarried, heterosexual unmarried, gay male and lesbian female households.13In every specification reported, these covariates include indicators for race, Hispanic ethnicity, andtime and geographical region indicator variables.10not interpretable as the compensated labor supply elasticity, but instead as the effect of alifetime wage increase (Blundell and MaCurdy 1999). All coefficients are allowed to differacross the eight individual types ce.I do not estimate the labor market participation choice. This is primarily for compa-rability with the previous literature. For the purposes of estimating tax revenue changesin section 5, this is equivalent to assuming that for the relevant range of policy options, noindividual will opt into or out of the labor market due to changes in household taxationstemming from marital choices.Standard economic theory makes clear that hours worked and wages are endogenouslydetermined, as high-productivity workers will typically work more hours and draw higherwages, biasing OLS regression results. I use two sources of exogenous variation in net-of-taxation marginal wages. First, I estimate equation 2 using data only from 2003 and2004, exploiting the expected break in tax rates, all else equal, caused by the JGTRRA.14Second, I use only changes in wages associated with exogenous characteristics. In par-ticular, I use group-membership indicators as instruments for wages (Angrist 1991). Theidentifying assumption is that the demographic groups are defined such that they areunrelated and unchangeable with respect to the policy change, but the policy change hasdifferent effects on the different groups (Blundell, Duncan and Meghir (BDM) 1998). Theintuition of the instruments can be seen in table 2, where the change in tax burden afterthe JGTRRA varies substantially across coresidency type and the number of childrenpresent.Because of the progressivity of the tax schedule, the tax cuts will have a differenteffect on households of different income levels. I take each partners’ birth year and levelof terminal education to be shifters of earnings. Both are clearly exogenous with respectto current economic conditions. BDM (1998) suggest (but do not use) the presence ofchildren as a grouping instrument, and the tax code explicitly changed with respect to thetreatment of children. While it is unlikely that there was sufficient time to adjust familysize in response to the tax cuts between 2003 and 2004, I take the precaution of groupinghouseholds by the presence of children aged 2-15 as another demographically exogenouscharacteristic. It is not possible to bear a child and rear it to two years of age in the14In addition, a short time horizon reduces any potential impact of a violation of the “parallel-lines”assumption implicit in the class of instrumental variables estimators that I apply (BDM 1998).11two sample years in response to the policy shock, and since parents are generally legallyresponsible to rear a child until age 18, it is very difficult to remove a child under age 15or 16 from the household in response to economic conditions.15 I create three categoriesfor each of these variables. Allowing group means to differ across time generates 54 (=3 x 3 x 3 x 2) groups per ce type. Devereaux (2004) points out that in the presence ofassortative mating, not only will own-wage be endogenous, but so will partner wage. Bothhe and Antecol and Steinberger (2011) instrument for both own- and parter-wages. I alsowill treat partner wages as endogenous, and include a set of 54 indicators for partner typein the vector of instruments, in addition to the own-type indicators.Since individuals have reservation wages (due to the value of leisure, fixed costs ofworking, etc), those who draw low wage offers will opt out of the labor force. Low-skillworkers will be particularly likely to draw very low offers, causing low-offer individualsand their parters to be omitted from the estimates of equation 2. This tends to biasα1ce downward for secondary workers.16 Two commonly-applied corrections for this issueare wage imputation (Blau and Kahn 2007) and re-weighting schemes (Juhn 1992, Juhnand Murphy 1997). Both function to represent the entire wage offer distribution whenwe estimate equation 2. The implementation of these corrections is described in detailin appendix A.1. Since all prime earners work in my sample, these corrections are onlymade with respect to households whose secondary earners do not report a wage.Table 4 presents estimates of the equation 2 labor supply model. Panel A gives thebasic grouped-mean IV estimates while panels C and C add in the re-weighting and wageimputation censoring corrections, respectively.By and large, primary earners are fairly similar across coresidency type. Own-wagecoefficients tend to be small or statistically indistinguishable from zero at conventionallevels. The insignificant heterosexual male coefficients suggest an uncompensated own-wage elasticity between 0.02 and 0.05. For gay men, the (also statistically insignificant)elasticity estimates range from 0.005 to -0.08. Children have little influence on laborsupply decisions of prime earners. We can never reject the hypothesis that the sensitivityof hours worked to wages (either their own, or their partner’s) between married men and15This discussion clearly omits the small impact of adoption or child mortality.16The bias in α2ce for secondary workers and in both log wage coefficients for primary workers istheoretically ambiguous, depending on the effects of productive substitution and complementarity, andassortative mating.12prime-earning homosexuals is equal. Correcting for selection of partners into the laborforce reduces our estimates of the sensitivity of labor supply to own-wages and partner-wages among unmarried households, heterosexual and homosexual alike.The same broad-brush similarly does not hold among secondary earners. There areessentially two types of secondary earners: married women, and everyone else. Consis-tent with the literature (Mroz 1987, Blundell and MaCurdy 1999), in every specification,married women have upward-sloping supply curves. Panel C implies an uncompensatedown-wage elasticity among working married women of 0.48. Secondary-earner homosex-uals and unmarried heterosexual women all behave similarly in terms of labor supply.Own- and partner-wage coefficients among these groups are the opposite sign as marriedwomen’s. Statistically, we always reject equivalence of wage effects between secondary-earning homosexuals and married women, and we can not reject equivalence to unmarriedwomen’s wage coefficients, except for among lesbian women in panel C. Across all threepanels, homosexual secondary earners’ hours are very sensitive to partner wages. Theuncompensated partner-wage elasticities range from 0.38 among lesbian women in panelB, to 0.45 among lesbian in panel C. In contrast to prime earners, controlling for labormarket selectivity increases our estimates of the sensitivity of labor supply to own-wagesand partner-wages for secondary earners in all household types.It is consistent with past literature to find negative labor supply elasticities amongnon-married secondary earners. Antecol and Steinberger (2011) find negative own-wageelasticities among lesbian women in the 2000 Census. Stevenson and Wolfers (2007) ar-gue that childless couples are much more likely to form couples on the basis of assortativemating (rather than labor market specialization). Non-married secondary earners aremore likely to work than married women (see table 1), and the positive partner-wagecoefficients are consistent with assortative mating behavior. Black, Sanders and Taylor(2007) argue that since homosexual couples have fewer children, they tend to gravitate tohigher-private-amenity, higher-cost areas. The rewards to living in a dual-earner house-holds are presumably greater in these areas, and this could drive greater household sortingby ability and greater coordination of labor supply decisions.134.1.2 Endogenous marriage penaltyGiven estimates of hours worked as a function of net-of-taxes wages, we can return tothe measurement of the marriage penalty. The standard marriage penalty calculation isinstantaneous in the sense of assuming no behavioral response to the shift in tax schedulethat occurs upon marriage. Table 3 shows that there are substantial changes in marginaltax rates upon marriage, and so this assumption is rather unappealing. Instead, table 4tells us that workers will adjust hours in response to changes in the tax schedule. Thesehours adjustments will change the tax burden, and so will affect the marriage penalty. Idescribe here an alternate way of calculating the marriage penalty, allowing for endogenoushours response to marriage and divorce, and I calculate the average bias implicit in thestandard instantaneous measure.I use the coefficients from my estimates of equation 2 to predict labor supply giventhe change in tax schedule.17 Letting µ be the marginal tax rate, a worker’s expectedlabor income is woicetĥicet = woicet(α̂1(woicet(1−µoicet))+ α̂2(wpicet(1−µpicet))+ β̂ceXicet), wherenon-labor income is included in the Xicet here.18A worker’s hours choice will change as a function of changes in both her own marginaltax rate and her partner’s. The marginal tax rate µoicet is in turn a function of thehours choice. I predict each worker’s hours choice given married and single tax schedules,household wages, the Xicet variables, and the value of income tax deductions. Predictedhours imply a marginal tax rate, which in turn give am hours choice. I iterate over thisprocess until marginal tax rates for both household members converge. This generatespredicted tax labilities when single and when married.Denote the predictions of hours under each tax system for each earner to be ĥeq, whereq ∈ (m, s) indicates marital status (and −q implies the counterfactual marital status).This hours choice implies a gross income ŷeq and average tax rate τ̂eq . I show in appendixA.3 that we can state the bias (overstatement) of the instantaneous method relative to17I use the Blau and Kahn adjustment to estimate potential wages throughout the paper. All the dataused in this section if from the years 2004-2007, under the post-JGTRRA tax system.18One way to justify the use of an instantaneous marriage penalty is to assume that hours are a functionof gross wages rather than net-of-taxes wages. Since wages are typically assumed to be exogenous tomarital status, hicet does not change upon marriage if taxes are excluded from the hours equation.14the endogenous method to beI − E =∑e=1,2we[heq((τ em − τ es )− (τ̂ em − τ̂ es ))+ (heq − ĥeq)(τ̂ em − τ̂ es )+ τ e−q((hem − hes)− (ĥem − ĥes))+ (τ e−q − τ̂ e−q)(ĥem − ĥes)]+ nem(τem − τ̂ em)− nes(τ es − τ̂ es )(3)where variables without hats represent the observed values in the data, as used in theinstantaneous method of calculation.There are five types of bias described in equation 3. The first term, weheq ((τem − τ es )- (τ̂ em − τ̂ es )), describes the tax rate bias of the instantaneous method: the tax revenueimpact of the fact that, because it does not allow workers to adjust labor market choices,the change in the tax rate upon marriage is overstated (evaluated at the observed levelof hours worked). The second term, we(heq − ĥeq)(τ̂ em − τ̂ es ), describes the modeling bias :the difference in collected tax revenue due to the difference in predicted labor marketearnings in the observed marital state. Note that this does not primarily come fromprediction error in the hours equation, which in expectation is mean-zero. Instead, itcomes from the induced correlation between hours and wages that arises when we predicthours according to equation 2. The third term, weτ e−q((hem − hes)− (ĥem − ĥes)), describesthe instantaneous hours bias : the value of the expected hours response to the changesin taxation upon marriage (since I hold deductions and non-work income constant). Thefourth term, we(τ e−q− τ̂ e−q)(ĥem−ĥes) is the counterfactual bias, the value of the difference intax rates calculated for the non-observed marital status. Finally, nem(τem−τ̂ em)−nes(τ es−τ̂ es ),the non-work income bias represents the difference in tax treatment of non-work incomebetween the two methods. Table 5 decomposes the average difference in the two marriagepenalty measures, by coresidency type, into these 5 sources of bias.For every household type, allowing for an endogenous labor market response to changesin the tax schedule results in higher predicted marriage penalties, on the order of $900per household. The role of the non-work income and counterfactual biases are very small.For secondary earners, the modeling bias is quite large. Since wages and hours are, byconstruction, much more highly correlated when we model hours as a function of wages,we tend to over-predict hours for high-wage workers and under-predict hours for low-wage15workers (illustrating one aspect of why the labor supply behavior of secondary earners isof such perennial research interest (Blundell and MaCurdy 1999)). This modeling bias isparticularly large for heterosexual married couples and gay men, the two highest-earninghousehold types.The two biases of primary theoretical interest are the tax rate bias and the hoursbias. The instantaneous method assumes no hours response to changes in taxation due toentrance or exit into marriage. In terms of tax revenue, for the average heterosexual couplethis assumption is not unreasonable. The endogenous method predicts only small averagechanges in hours worked after changing marital status. The endogenous method predictsa $55 smaller marriage penalty as a result. Secondary earners in homosexual householdsare predicted to work substantially more when married (ĥem− ĥes) > (hem−hes), generating$167 and $283 more in tax revenue from gay and lesbian households, respectively, thanpredicted by the instantaneous method. This is the largest component of (non-modeling)instantaneous bias for homosexual households. For heterosexual households, the tax ratebias is the largest (non-modeling) contributor to the instantaneous bias. Allowing forendogenous labor market responses, the tax rate when single will be lower, and the taxrate when married higher (since (τ̂ em − τ̂ es ) > (τ em − τ es )) than the instantaneous methodasserts, contributing $360 to the instantaneous under-prediction of marriage penalties.Clearly, accounting for the responsiveness of labor supply to changes in the tax struc-ture could have a large impact on our estimates of the tax revenue changes generated bysame-sex marriage legalization.4.2 Marriage choiceVery few studies have measured the consequences of the Bush tax cuts on the labor market.None, to my knowledge, have focused on its consequences in terms of the marriage market.In terms of labor market effects, Heim (2009) simulates the consequences of the JGTRRAbased on estimates from the 2001 PSID. Auten, Carroll, and Gee (2008) estimate thesensitivity of taxable income to the tax change, but not the sensitivity of labor supply perse. A much larger literature exists with respect to the effects on consumption and savingswith respect to the 2001 tax rebate (see for example Johnson, Parker and Souleles (2006)and its references). In addition to using plausibly exogenous and unexpected changes in16policy, my estimates are the first that I’m aware of to account for the fact that assignmentsto treatment groups (i.e., the size of the marriage penalty) is non-random with respect toobservable characteristics.Alm and Whittington (2003) undertake the most thorough longitudinal study of theeffects of taxation on marriage (among heterosexuals). They show that while transitionsfrom non-cohabitation to cohabitation (either married or not) are insensitive to taxa-tion, the transition from unmarried cohabitation to marriage is significantly influenced bychanges in the household’s instantaneous marriage penalty. Badgett, Gates, and Maisel(2008) analyze the sensitivity of cohabitation status to economic factors among homosex-ual couples, and find little influence.The marriage penalty is not distributed randomly with respect to marital status, andso simple OLS will provide a biased estimate of the effect of taxes on marriage.19 Sincemarital choice is partly a function of the expected marriage penalty, we must estimatemartial choice as a function of unexpected changes in the marriage penalty. Alm andWhittington (2003) used variation used from changes in tax law between 1983-1997 toreach their conclusions. They show in previous work (Alm and Whittington 1996), how-ever, that no discrete changes in the marriage penalty occurred over that time period.The JGTRRA created the first major jump in the marriage penalty since 1977 (see figure1 and Alm and Whittington (1996)), and was largely unexpected.I apply the Hirano-Imbens (2005) estimator of the effects of a continuous treatmentvariable. The treatment is the “jump” between the expected marriage penalty as a func-tion of the pre-JGTRRA tax schedule p̂(y1, y2) and the actually-experienced marriagepenalty after implementation of the JGTRRA, P (y1, y2). In essence, the expectationp̂(y1, y2) can be treated as a taxation propensity score, a function of observable character-istics. I identify responsiveness of marital choice to taxation by comparing households withidentical p̂(y1, y2) that are exposed to varying levels of the treatment, P (y1, y2). To ensurethe necessary condition of sample overlap is satisfied (Imbens 2004), I balance the datafollowing Barsky, Bound, Charles, and Lupman (BBCL 2002). The weights constructedby the BBCL procedure impose the counterfactual assumption that the distribution of19For example, in the standard Becker (1991) model of household formation, partners will choose tospecialize in market or non-market production. All else equal, individuals who plan to marry will also a)tend to be more specialized, and b) will have higher-earning primary workers. Each of these facts affectsthe marriage penalty.17P (y1, y2) among married household matches the distribution observed among unmarriedhouseholds. Intuitively, this process places greater weight on the married households thatare observably most similar to non-married households in terms of the treatment received.Appendix A.2 describes the precise econometric procedure used to derive the estimatesof this section.Figure 3 plots the likelihood of marriage as a function of the marriage penalty (theoutcome of equation A.5, ̂E(Im(P (y1, y2)))), for three types of heterosexual households:those with no children, those with one child, and those with more than one child. Theplots are estimated via local polynomial regression. Under the assumptions of (weak) un-confoundedness and overlap (as summarized in Imbens (2004)) these functions describethe causal effect of marriage penalties on marital choice. The black curves are estimatesbased on the instantaneous penalty, while grey curves are estimates based on the endoge-nous penalty (with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals in dashed grey lines).There are three main conclusions from figure 3. First, the marriage penalty conveysa clear negative treatment effect among childless couples. Imposing the assumption ofstrict linearity in the treatment effect, the coefficient from regressing predicted marriageoutcomes (as predicted via the results reported in table A.2) on the instantaneous marriagepenalty is -0.000031 (s.e. = 0.00001). Evaluated at a typical marriage penalty cut ofaround -$800, this implies an increase in the probability of marriage of three-fifths of apercentage point for a childless couple (from 85.0% to 85.6%). This is a small effect, to besure, but statistically significant and in line with the previous literature. This estimate isalmost identical to that of Alm and Whittington (2003).Second, the results are relatively insensitive to whether we use changes in the instanta-neous or endogenous measure of the marriage penalty. Among childless couples, the lineartreatment effect of the endogenous marriage penalty on marriage likelihood is -0.000045(s.e. = 0.00001). This at once confirms that past studies of the relationship between tax-ation and marriage are robust to this new measure of the marriage penalty, while allowingus to apply more economically realistic measures of the tax revenue response to changesin marital status.Third, among households with children, there is little evidence that unexpected changesin the marriage penalty cause changes in marriage likelihood. Both marriage penalty mea-18sures suggest an insignificant negative relationship between marriage and penalties amongmulti-child households. The instantaneous penalty implies a significantly positive rela-tionship among single-child households (coefficient = 0.000033, s.e. = 0.00001), but theendogenous penalty implies a much smaller, negative, statistically insignificant effect. Asthe plot illustrates, the positive linear relationship of the instantaneous method comesalmost entirely from the very imprecise estimates among low-penalty households.20 Theconservative conclusion is to reject the hypothesis of a consistent treatment effect, positiveor negative, in this group.5 Consequences of Same-Sex Marriage LegalizationA primary difficulty in estimating the effects of same-sex marriage legalization on fed-eral income tax collection is knowing the marriage rate applicable to homosexual couples.Previous studies have applied a number of rates. The Williams Institute at UCLA as-sumes a 50% same-sex marriage rate (Badgett and Sears 2005, Badgett 2010).21 Badgett(2010) also cites a number of studies that suggest that 80% of young gay individualshope to marry. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO 2004) assumes that to a firstapproximation, all cohabiting same-sex couples would marry.There are alternatives to these assumptions. We might assume that marriage likeli-hood is a function of demographic characteristics and is unrelated to sexual orientation.I impose this assumption by estimating the likelihood of marriage (among heterosexuals)via probit regression, as a function of age, terminal education, number of children in thehousehold, and state of residence. Or, we could assume that marriage likelihood amongsame-sex couples is responsive to the marriage penalty in exactly the same way as it isamong heterosexuals: the dose-response functions of figure 3 apply to same-sex couples.Finally (for the purposes of this paper) we could assume, as does the Williams Institute,20Among one-child households, the lower the woman’s earnings, the less likely she is to be married.The opposite is true among the childless and multiple child families. Since marriage penalties fall asthe secondary earner’s income fall (i.e., the tax code rewards specialization and penalizes dual-earners),there is a relatively large pool of high-subsidy unmarried one-child couples, which generates the inverted-Ushape of the dose-response function using the instantaneous method. Notice the large confidence intervalsaround the average marriage likelihood in this group. This relates to the growth of out-of-wedlock birthsin poor urban areas (Stevenson and Wolfers 2007).21The Williams Institute has released a series of state-level evaluations of the fis-cal impact of state-level same-sex marriage legalization, which may be found athttp://www2.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute//publications/Policy-Econ-index.html.19that the typical same-sex household has a 50% likelihood of marrying, but that marriagelikelihood decreases in the marriage penalty, exactly as in figure 3. I take the figure 3marital response functions and decrease them until they have a mean likelihood of 0.5.Let pi be the probability of marriage, and Tqi be the tax lability of household i givenmarital status q. Given that all same-sex couples are single prior to legalization, theexpected change in federal tax liability after legalization is pi(Tmi − T si ), or p times themarriage penalty. I aggregate to the national level by multiplying this number times itshousehold sampling weight and summing by year. My estimates are conservative for tworeasons. The first is because of the under-count of same-sex couples in the Census dueto the omission of individuals with allocated gender and marital status. Second, becausewe can only observe existing coresident homosexual couples in the Census and ACS, Ican not account for the degree to which gay and lesbian will form households based onlegalization of same-sex marriage.Table 6 presents annual averages for the indicated time frames (2000-2002 and 2005-2007) for three measures of the marriage penalty: the instantaneous penalty, the endoge-nous penalty, and a“de-biased” penalty that removes the contribution of the modelingand counterfactual biases from the discrepancy between the instantaneous and endoge-nous methods, so that only the changes due to endogenous hours, tax rate, and nonworkincome adjustments remain.I present the income tax revenue estimates from 2000-2002 mainly to compare myestimates to previous work. The CBO (2004) estimated a pre-JGTRRA revenue boostbetween $200-$400 million, using a 100% marriage rate and an instantaneous penaltymeasure. My estimate in this case is a $231 million revenue boost, within their range, butat the low end. Alm, Badgett, and Whittington (2000), who do not use individual-leveltax data, estimate revenue boosts in the range of $260 million to $1.3 billion, with theirpreferred estimate being $1 billion in additional income tax revenue. My instantaneousestimates are all below this range.Between 2000 and 2002, the endogenous method of measuring the marriage penaltyimplies revenue boosts that are consistently more than double those of the instantaneousmethod. At the high end of the estimates, when we use the unadjusted endogenouspenalty and assume a 100% marriage rate among observed same-sex couples, the federal20revenue gain is $491 million. At the low end, the bias-corrected endogenous penalty,assuming a 50% mean marriage rate and the empirical marginal response of marriagelikelihood to the marriage penalty, the revenue gain to marriage legalization would havebeen $176 million. Notice that applying this “mean-50 conditional marriage expectation”almost always results in lower revenue estimates than the simple p = 0.5 estimates, sincehigh-penalty households are the least likely to marry, all else equal.My preferred results are the estimates based on the endogenous marriage penalty,and using the heterosexual conditional marriage expectation. This measure allows foroptimizing agents to respond to the tax system in terms of both marriage and laborsupply choice. The mean marriage probability among childless couples (the child-rearingcategory into which most same-sex couples fall) is around 85%. While this is much higherthan the Williams Institute’s preferred value, it is below that used by the CBO, and is inline with survey data on expressed willingness-to-marry among same-sex couples (Badgett2010). The de-biased endogenous penalty corrects for some of the problems inherent inpredicting hours choices (in particular, the induced wage-hour correlation), and in termsof revenue is always a more conservative estimate of revenue gains, so I tend to preferthose results in this context. Allowing for endogenous economic response, my preferredestimate implies an income tax revenue boost of $131 million (and no larger than $252million, for any plausible set of assumptions). In the time period between the JGTRRAand the economic crisis of 2008, I estimate that the instantaneous method under-states therevenue gains from legalization, relative to the de-biased endogenous penalty, by $60-$120million annually.In the context of the federal budget, where income tax revenues were on the order of$1 trillion, these revenue gains are obviously very small. To put the same-sex numbersinto context, in 2007, married heterosexual couples contributed the equivalent of $5.4billion in (instantaneous) marriage penalty revenue to the federal government, or about$160 per married household. The expected gain in per-household revenue upon same-sexmarriage legalization based on the instantaneous penalty and the heterosexual conditionalmarriage expectation is $118.These estimates do not incorporate the changes in federal government expenditurethat would arise from same-sex marriage legalization. These payments are projected to21be small, on the order of $100 million in total annually, split mainly between medicareand social security payments to spouses (CBO 2009) and health care and other partnerbenefits (CBO 2010). Interestingly, these cost increases almost exactly offset my preferredestimate of the revenue gains, suggesting that the federal legalization of same-sex marriagemay be revenue-neutral.6 ConclusionSame-sex marriage legalization is a topic that inspires passionate responses from partisanson all sides. While the politics of the debate are likely to remain hot, it’s necessary tohave cool economic analysis at hand to understand the costs and benefits of the proposal.While many people have argued about the financial aspects of the law, I argue thatcredible economic and statistical identification is hard to find in the literature. I exploit amajor exogenous break in the tax code to estimate the labor market response to changesin the tax rate that would accompany same-sex marriage, were it legalized. Using thesame tax code shock, I present new evidence on the sensitivity of marriage to taxes amongcohabiting couples.I show that primary and secondary earners in homosexual households make very dif-ferent labor market choices as a function of net wages. Further, the supply functionsof homosexual couples are very different from heterosexual married couples. As such, itis reasonable to assume that homosexual and heterosexual couples’ tax burdens mightdiffer after marriage, all else equal. I present a new measure of the marriage penalty, theendogenous penalty, that measures the change in tax burden upon marriage as a functionof the optimal labor market choices of both parters across households of different types.I argue that the most reasonable estimates of the changes in tax revenue upon legaliza-tion are in the $100-$175 million range. Including reasonable measures of the additionalcosts that would come with same-sex marriage legalization, this implies the policy is atleast, on net, revenue-neutral, and may generate a small boost to federal governmentalcoffers.22A AppendixA.1 Labor Supply EstimationA.1.1 Grouping instrumentsI separate families with children aged 2-15 into three groups, those with 0 children, 1child, or 2 or more children. I use three cohorts, defined by those born 1959 and earlier,those born 1960-1969, and those born 1970 or after. The educational groups are thosewith a high school diploma or less, those with more than high school but less than abachelors degree (including college dropouts and those with associates degrees or simi-lar credentials), and those with bachelor’s and/or post-baccalaureate degrees. In everyspecification, I allow group effects to differ before and after the Bush tax (over two timeperiods t). Interacting the categories, I have 3 x 3 x 3 x 2 = 54 groups. I estimateequation 2 separately by coresidency group and earner type. Denote the vector of thesegroup indicators gce. Due to the potential presence of assortative mating, in every laborsupply regression, I instrument wages using both own- and partner-group indicators.A.1.2 Selection: re-weightingI follow the framework of Juhn and Murphy (1997) to implement the re-weighting cor-rection for censoring at the bottom of the wage offer distribution. The idea is that thosewith low wage offers are likely to have low skill, and therefore would have both low wageoffers and low hours worked, if they participated in the market. The people with reportedwage data who are most similar to those without reported wages are those from the samegroup gce with low hours. I define “low hours” as 1 to 20 hours on the job in the typicalweek.I define the number of individuals of each gce group who did not work as N0g and thenumber who worked 1 to 20 hours as N1g . Let the weight adjustment ag = (1 +N0gN1g).This adjustment factor ag allows households where the secondary earner works low hours(has low skill) to represent both working (non-censored) and non-working (censored)observations. Where ωicet represents the sampling weights and usict is the usual weeklyhours of work of the secondary earner in each observed household, define the adjustedweights byλicet =0 if usict = 0ag ∗ ωicet if 1 ≤ usict ≤ 20ωicet if usict > 20(A.1)This adjustment is applied to both the primary and secondary earner to account forassortative mating or any other relationship between censored observations and observablehousehold characteristics.Juhn and Murphy (1997) argue that this method has the advantage of incorporatingthe distribution of all observable characteristics into the estimates, as opposed to onlyusing information on mean wages, as done in the wage imputation method describedbelow.23A.1.3 Selection: wage imputationThis procedure follows the discussion in Blau and Kahn (2007), and is widely applied inthe literature. Again start with the set of grouping instruments gce.Again assume that those who do not work are “low skilled” and most comparable toworkers (of their gce type) who work low hours (1 ≤ usict ≤ 20). Among secondary workers,I estimate the conditional mean of net-of-tax log wages using the equationlnwicet = ψgctgcet + γZicet + υicet (A.2)where ψgct is the vector of coefficients associated with group indicators, Zicet is a vector ofvariables (whose effects are common across gce types) that shift wages. I include race andgeographic region indicators in Zicet, and I allow for the existence of coresidency-group-specific time trends in wages.I use the parameter estimates from equation A.2 to impute lnwicet to secondary earnerswithout wage data due to zero reported work hours. These conditional mean wageŝlnwicetare then included (and the households no longer dropped) when I run the labor supplyregression, equation 2. These wages are used both as ln(woicet) in the secondary-earnerregressions and as ln(wpicet) in primary earner regressions.A.2 Marriage Choice EstimationTo estimate marriage choice as a function of the marriage penalty, I apply three correctionsto ensure the exogeneity of the marriage penalty with respect to marital status. Followingthe Hirano and Imbens (2005) model for continuous treatment variables, I estimate theconditional marriage functionE(Im(pi)| p) = α0 + α1pi + α2pi2 + α3p(y1, y2) + α4p(y1, y2)2 + α5pi · p(y1, y2) (A.3)where Im is an indicator variable taking the value of one when the individual is married, pirepresents the treatment variable, the marriage penalty, and p = p(y1, y2) is the expectedmarriage penalty as a function of taxable assets and offsets of each household member,as in equation 1. p(y1, y2) is also referred to as the generalized propensity score. My firstsource of exogeneity is to only use changes in the marriage penalty around the expectedlevel to identify the effects of marriage penalty on marriage.Since “true” marriage penalty pi is actually a deterministic function of y1 and y2, itmight appear that any differences between pi and the our estimate of this generalizedpropensity score p̂(y1, y2) must come via functional-form misspecifications of p(y1, y2).This would be true if the tax schedule were fixed across time, but my second source ofexogeneity is the JGTRRA tax reforms of 2003. I estimate the coefficients of the propen-sity score function based on data from 2002 and 2003 (the time between the EGTRRAand JGTRRA reforms) and then predict p̂(y1, y2) based on y1 and y2 data observed in2003 and 2004 (immediately before and after the JGTRRA). Thus, the primary source ofvariation in pi conditional on p̂(y1, y2) in equation A.3 is the unexpected shock to the taxschedule in tax year 2003. I estimate the propensity score via OLS using quadratic termsin the income of the higher-earner and the earnings gap between household members (seeEissa and Hoynes 2000), linear terms in non-work income and expenditure variables, andindicator variables for every possible number of children. The propensity score regression24results are given in table A.1. Adding higher-order polynomial terms in any variable doesnot affect explanatory power, R2. The results clearly do not capture all the non-linearitiesof the tax schedule (else, the R2 would equal 1), but it does explain the great bulk of thedeterminants of the marriage penalty.While equation A.3 describes the response of marriage to unexpected changes in themarriage penalty, it does not imply anything about how common each level of treatmentis among those who are married and those who are unmarried. In particular, since theCensus is purely cross-sectional, individuals who are married tend to be much older,higher-income, and more specialized in the labor market. Each of these factors implies thatthe married are over-represented among low-penalty households and under-representedamong high-penalty households. In order to “balance” the sample in order to create ofsample overlap (a necessary condition for identification) and to place appropriate weighton those married households most observably similar to unmarried households, my thirdcorrection is to re-weight the data following the method of BBCL (2002).Intuitively, we ask: given pi, what is the relative likelihood that the individual isunmarried, as a proportion of the population representation? In practice, I partition theunmarried in the 2003 Census into 20 marriage penalty quantile bins defined by pib. Sincethe tax schedule changed in 2003, people with the same observable characteristics willhave different treatment levels pi in 2003 and 2004. Holding the tax schedule constant(which involves generating counterfactual taxes via TAXSIM under the assumption thatthere was no JGTRRA) I take every heterosexual in 2004 and every married household in2003 and place them into the appropriate 2003 unmarried penalty bin pib. Then for eachbin I construct the weight adjustment factorφ(pi) =Pr(Im = 0| pi)/Pr(Im = 0)Pr(Im = 1| pi)/Pr(Im = 1) if pib−1 < pi ≤ pib. (A.4)Given sample weights ωicet, the weights applied in the estimation of equation A.3 areωicet × φ(piict). This process balances the sample with respect to the determinants ofpi, and the tax schedule changes after 2003. BBCL stress that this weight imposes theassumption that the distribution of the treatment (the marriage penalty) among themarried matches the distribution among the unmarried. I set φ(pi)=0 for households whosemarriage penalty is either greater than the maximum observed among the unmarried in2003, or is lower than the minimum, to enforce a common support of the treatmentvariable.The entire process described above allows me to recover the average potential out-come (or “dose-response” function) by predicting the expected marriage outcome overthe treatment levels of interest. This dose-response function is given bŷE(Im(pi)) =E[α̂0 + α̂1piict + α̂2pi2ict+ α̂3p̂(y1ict, y2ict) + α̂4p̂(y1ict, y2ict)2 + α̂5piict · p̂(y1ict, y2ict)] (A.5)where the term inside the brackets on the righthand side is evaluated for each individual,and the expectation over these values is evaluated by local polynomial regression over 50centiles of the marriage penalty pi. Since ̂E(Im(pi)) is estimated using generated regressorsand parameters, I recover standard errors by bootstrapping the entire process describedabove 1000 times over the sample of heterosexual households observed between 2002 and2004. Equation A.5 estimates the causal effects of marriage penalties on marital choice.25I do this by penalty type (both instantaneous and endogenous) and by the number ofchildren present in the household (none, one, or greater than one).The regression output from equation A.3 is given in table A.2. These results are usedto predict the righthand side of equation A.5. The estimates of the average potentialoutcome ̂E(Im(pi)) are plotted in figure 3.A.3 Bias of Instantaneous Marriage PenaltyTo state the bias of the instantaneous method, I make two assumptions. First, workers donot opt into or out of the labor market due to the marital tax schedule changes. Second,I assume that an individual’s (household’s) income tax deduction is independent of theirlevel of income, at least on the margin of changes being considered. Wages are also treatedas fixed here. Let e ∈ {1, 2} denote the primary and secondary earner, respectively, andq ∈ {m, s} denote martial status (married, single). The instantaneous method assumesthat within each household, each individual’s hours are fixed at the observed level heq = he.Taking wages we and non-labor income ne as given, write instantaneous gross income inmartial state q as yeq = wehe + ne. Given the average tax rate τ eq , we can calculate theinstantaneous marriage penaltyI = [τ 1my1m + τ2my2m]− [τ 1s y1s + τ 2s y2s ] . (A.6)When labor supply choice is allowed to be a function of the marginal tax rate, I writeexpected hours and income given taxes as ĥeq and ŷeq = weĥeq + ne. Acknowledging thatthe average tax rate is in turn dependent on this endogenous hours choice, τ̂ eq , we canwrite the endogenous marriage penalty asE = [τ̂ 1mŷ1m + τ̂2mŷ2m]− [τ̂ 1s ŷ1s + τ̂ 2s ŷ2s ] . (A.7)The bias of the instantaneous method of measurement is thenI − E =[(τ 1my1m − τ̂ 1mŷ1m)− (τ 1s y1s − τ̂ 1s ŷ1s)]+[(τ 2my2m − τ̂ 2mŷ2m)− (τ 2s y2s − τ̂ 2s ŷ2s)](A.8)One particularly useful way of stating this bias arises by first pulling non-work incomeout of yeq , and adding and subtracting, for an individual of observed martial status q (and−q representing the other marital status) the terms weheqτ e−q, weĥeq τ̂ e−q, weye−q(τ̂ em − τ̂ es ),and weτ eq (ĥem − ĥes). The result is that we can state the instantaneous bias asI − E =∑e=1,2we[heq((τ em − τ es )− (τ̂ em − τ̂ es ))+ (heq − ĥeq)(τ̂ em − τˆ es )+ τ e−q((hem − hes)− (ĥem − ĥes))+ (τ e−q − τ̂ e−q)(ĥem − ĥes)]+ nem(τem − τ̂ em)− nes(τ es − τ̂ es )(A.9)which is equation 3 given in the text.References[1] Alm, James, M.

    "abstract": "The issue of same-sex marriage legalization is increasingly part of the national political dialogue. This legalization would have a number of economic impacts, one of the most direct being a change in income tax payments, through the so-called marriage penalty. I estimate the effects of same-sex marriage legalization on federal income tax revenue. These estimates rely critically on the responsiveness of labor supply and marital choice to changes in the tax code. I present new evidence on both topics using changes in taxation generated from the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. In addition, I propose a novel measure of the marriage penalty that incorporates the fact that agents will respond optimally to changes in marginal tax rates within the household",
