Currently, same-sex couples can legally marry in six U.S. states3 and the District of Columbia.4  Nine additional states have broad domestic  *  Associate Professor, Fordham Law School.

J., May 7, 2011, at A9.   2012] FOREWORD 539 right to marry might constitute sex discrimination in violation of the state constitution’s equal protection guarantee.9  After the case was returned to the lower court, the State was unable to persuade that court that it could demonstrate a compelling interest to justify barring marriages between individuals of the same sex.10  Yet same-sex couples never married in Hawaii:  the decision was mooted through an amendment to the Hawaii Constitution empowering the state legislature to reserve marriage to different-sex couples.11  But federal legislators did not wait for that outcome, arguing that if Hawaii, or another state, legalized marriages between individuals of the same sex, other states might be compelled to recognize those marriages under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.12  Section 2 of DOMA allows states to refuse to honor the validity of lawful out-of-state marriages between same-sex couples.13  Section 3 defines marriage for federal purposes as exclusively between different-sex couples.14 It is noteworthy that a statute that passed relatively recently with overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate15 could find itself so severely weakened in such a short period.  Since January of 2012, two federal appellate courts and a number of federal district courts have declared section 3 unconstitutional.16  Bankruptcy courts have struck down   9. Baehr v.

Reviewing the history around the passage of DOMA provides a window into a society deeply divided on the subject of marriage rights for same-sex couples. Congressman Bob Barr introduced the legislation to address a “direct assault by homosexual extremists all across this country.”20  Henry Hyde, then-Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, described the issue of marriage rights for same-sex couples as a “miserable, uncomfortable, queasy issue.”21  He noted that “most people do not approve of homosexual conduct . . . and they express their disapprobation through the law.”22  Other members of Congress railed against homosexuality as “immoral,”23 “depraved,”24 “unnatural,”25 and “based on perversion.”26 Equally telling is a contemporaneous interview of then-President Clinton featured in The Advocate (a magazine devoted to LGBT issues) in 1996.27  The author of the article, J. Jennings Moss, expressed dismay with Clinton’s overall record on gay rights issues, criticizing the President for failing to “follow[] through on his promise to open the military’s doors to gays and lesbians”28 and for staying on the sidelines in the landmark case of  Office of Pers. Mgmt., 824 F. Supp. 2d 968 (N.D. Cal. 2012), appeal filed, No. 12-15388 (9th Cir. Feb. 24, 2012), and No. 12-15409 (9th Cir.

Evans.29  Still, he praised the Clinton Administration for doing “more than any other [president] to help gay and lesbian Americans,”30 crediting the Administration for appointing openly gay men and lesbians to various positions within the executive branch;31 prohibiting antigay discrimination within the federal bureaucracy;32 and, “more significant[ly],” ending “the practice of denying federal employees security clearances just because they are gay or lesbian.”33  While Moss noted that the President planned to sign DOMA into law,34 he credited the Clinton Administration for supporting federal legislation barring sexual-orientation-based discrimination in private employment35—something that still awaits enactment by Congress. III. It is striking how far the ground has shifted in only sixteen years.  A strategy to do what had once seemed unattainable—persuading officials within the political branches to embrace marriage rights for same-sex couples—has proven successful.  When the New York legislature passed a marriage law in 2011, it more than doubled the percentage of Americans living in states with egalitarian marriage laws;36 that percentage will double again if the federal challenge to California’s Proposition 8,37 a statewide referendum that invalidated a state supreme court ruling upholding the freedom to marry for same-sex couples, is successful.  Recently, in Perry v. Brown,38 a Ninth Circuit panel narrowly upheld a district court decision striking down Proposition 8.39  The full court refused to grant en banc review,40 and a petition for certiorari has been filed in the U.S. Supreme Court.41  And while opponents of marriage equality have been extremely effective in using statewide referenda to prevent or reverse gains made by same-sex couples in state legislatures and state courts, advocates for the freedom to marry have put an initiative on the ballot in Maine for the   29. 517 U.S. 620 (1996); see Moss, supra note 27, at 46.  30.

In 2012, the legislatures in three states—Maryland, New Jersey, and Washington—passed legislation ending discrimination in marriage.44  New Jersey’s governor vetoed the bill,45 and the other two will not take effect unless they can overcome statewide referenda in the November 2012 elections.46  On May 8, 2012, North Carolina became the thirtieth state to approve by referendum a constitutional amendment restricting marriage to different-sex couples.47 IV.

In effect, DOMA[] . . . has become a de facto club used to limit, if not thwart, the ability of a state to choose to recognize same-sex unions.”55 V. The Obama Administration assumed a lead role in these events when it announced on February 23, 2011, that it would not defend the constitutionality of section 3 in court.56  The Administration’s nondefense of DOMA has been paired with a forceful challenge to the statute based on the argument that courts should apply heightened judicial scrutiny to all laws (including DOMA) that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation57—a constitutional position that, if accepted by the Supreme Court,58 would likely require the invalidation of virtually every remaining  Cir.

Both the governor and the attorney general of California refused to defend Proposition 8 in Perry, leaving private intervenors as its primary champions in the litigation.61  State executive officials in Illinois have refused to defend the constitutionality of an Illinois law denying marriage rights to same-sex couples.62  State executive officials in Massachusetts have challenged DOMA directly in litigation, arguing that section 3 violates the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment.63  Finally, although Rhode Island, Maryland,64 and New Mexico do not currently recognize the freedom of same-sex couples to marry, attorneys general in all three states have issued opinions indicating that those states will recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages as a matter of comity.65  section 3 because it was not substantially related to an important government interest.

The articles contained within this Symposium collection reflect the vast array of complex legal questions that intersect with DOMA today.  In his transcribed remarks, Professor Charles Fried, who served as Solicitor General of the United States from 1985 to 1989, argues that the Obama Administration’s nondefense of DOMA section 3 in the federal courts is in tension with the practice and traditions of the office of the Solicitor General.66  Professor Sai Prakash’s Article observes that the Obama Administration’s argument for heightened judicial scrutiny for sexual-orientation-based classifications, if accepted by the Supreme Court, would likely require the invalidation of all state statutes, including state constitutional amendments, proscribing same-sex marriage.67  For Prakash, the Obama Administration’s litigation stance contradicts, and renders hollow, the President’s public stance that the issue of marriage rights for same-sex couples should be decided on a state-by-state basis.  Professor Abner Greene argues in his Article that, to the extent the President’s hybrid enforce-but-not-defend policy is intended to preserve judicial review over DOMA’s constitutionality, such measures should not be necessary.68  For Greene, Congress should be deemed to have independent Article III standing to sue the President when he stops enforcing congressional acts he finds unconstitutional.  Professor and former Acting Assistant Attorney General heading the Office of Legal Counsel Dawn Johnsen argues in her Article that President Obama’s determination that heightened judicial scrutiny should apply in cases of sexual orientation discrimination, a standard the President believes DOMA clearly cannot satisfy, provides an appropriate context for a rare deviation from the traditional executive branch practice of defending congressional acts.69  Next, my Article details how the Obama Administration has interpreted statues other than DOMA to provide benefits to same-sex couples (in certain circumstances) and protect them from harm (in other circumstances) based on a legally relevant relationship status other than marriage.70  These policies reflect the Administration’s effort to balance its dual constitutional obligations to equal protection and the faithful execution of the laws, including compliance with DOMA. Professor Douglas NeJaime’s Article takes us inside the executive branch to challenge the conventional dichotomy between “cause lawyers” who work for the public interest and government attorneys who represent the   66.

Professor David Luban’s Article, responding to Professor NeJaime, offers a number of important distinctions between different kinds of causes and varieties of cause lawyering.  He tentatively suggests that reformists, not radicals, are more likely to be more successful pursuing their causes within government institutions.72 Another group of commentators considers, and critiques, the primacy of marriage within the broader movement for LGBT equality.  In his Article, Professor Bennett Capers argues against the claim, made by some, that securing the freedom to marry will resolve other vexing issues such as suicide rates among LGBT youth, hate crimes committed against those perceived to be gay or transgender, and discrimination in employment.73  Professor Nancy Polikoff argues that LGBT advocates have mistakenly failed to recognize the alignment of interests between different-sex couples who do not wish to marry and those within the LGBT community who feel the same way.74  As Polikoff sees it, the movement has, in failing to champion the rights of different-sex couples in cases involving domestic partnership benefits, sent the incorrect message that there is only one preferred form of LGBT family.  Professor Robin Lenhardt’s Article also contends that the LGBT movement would do well to promote not just marriage, but intimate choices more generally.75  For Lenhardt, such an approach would bring other groups more solidly into the struggle for LGBT equality. Professor Lynn Wardle’s Article opposes a universal right of same-sex couples to marry and cautions against “the prospect of unwelcome importation” of laws from jurisdictions that permit same-sex relationships into jurisdictions that do not.76  Finally, in his transcribed remarks, Professor Tobias Barrington Wolff, partially in response to Professor Wardle and more generally in response to other scholars who employ natural law theory to oppose marriage rights for same-sex couples, questions whether the implicit and explicit arguments made by these natural law scholars about the lives, loves, and dignity of LGBT persons deserve   71.

The Symposium could not have come at a better time:  there have been extraordinary changes in the political dynamics surrounding relationship rights since DOMA’s enactment in 1996, when same–sex couples could not marry in any U.S. or foreign jurisdiction.  Currently, same–sex couples can legally marry in six U.S. states and the District of Columbia.  Nine additional states have broad domestic partnership or civil union laws, and another four provide more limited forms of domestic partnership benefits.  Moreover, three other states that do not allow same–sex couples to marry will honor out–of–state marriages between gay and lesbian couples.  Eleven foreign jurisdictions permit marriage between same–sex couples as well",
