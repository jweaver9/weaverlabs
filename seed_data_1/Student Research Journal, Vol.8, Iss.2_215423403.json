The consequences of current events are sure to have a lasting effect on our democracy, but at this time, they remain unknown. While we have crossed over to a different sort of governing and a different sort of truth, we have also stepped into the possibility of immense growth and change. We know, as burgeoning and current librarians, archivists, and information scientists, that accuracy is important, information is valuable, and knowledge is power. These principles rest at the heart of our work, and so this point in time provides us with the opportunity to shake things up, to do things differently, to be more inclusive, and to get involved. The authors in this, the SRJ’s 16th issue, ask important questions to support this involvement:  How can dynamic collaborations between researchers and practitioners move our field forward? How can public librarians and our allies most effectively advocate for libraries and, therefore, our field? How can we as archivists broaden the diversity of archives, ensuring all people are represented?   I had the great good fortune to have taken the Political Activism class with our invited contributor, Patrick Sweeney, two semesters ago. Sweeney’s book, Winning Elections and Influencing Politicians for Library Funding, provided invaluable guidance on how to fight (and win!) politically for library funding. Sweeney’s new book Before the Ballot: Building Political Support for Library Funding was released January 4th. Here we present a chapter to help prepare us for what will certainly be an exciting 2020 political season. Former SRJ editor Stacy Andell contributes our first published evidence summary, guidelines for which were designed by Canada’s Evidence-Based Library and Information Practice journal.  Andell evaluates a bibliometric study done by Yu-Wei Chang, who examined the characteristics of articles co-authored by researchers and practitioners in LIS journals. A likely, but up until this point, rare pairing.  Author Autumn Wetli rounds the journal out with an extensive literature review on the diversity of archives. She highlights that it is not only who is represented in archives, but how they are represented, how they are selected for inclusion, from theoretical to practical process. This review calls for a method that is “focused on the promotion of social justice, is aware of its flaws and biases, while still being hopeful and forward-looking” (Wetli, 2019).  Acknowledgments  I want to start out by thanking Morgan Briles at bepress who has worked tireless with us to update the SRJ webpage. She has spent countless hours preparing the site, so that our new look could be launched with this issue.  A standing ovation for the members of the editorial team whose dedication to SRJ and its authors have made this issue possible: Stephanie Akau, Stacy Andell, Channon Arabit, Claire Goldstein, Rachel Greggs, and Lisa Lowdermilk. A special thank you to our outgoing Managing Editor, Kelly Pollard, who graciously brought me on board, showed me the ropes and was an excellent partner in all aspects of SRJ’s running. A warm welcome back to Rachel Greggs who starts 2019 as our new Managing Editor. A generous thank you to our advisor, Dr. Anthony Bernier; while the entire editorial team benefits from Dr. 8School of Information Student Research Journal, Vol. 8, Iss. 2 [2019], Art. 5https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol8/iss2/5 10Bernier’s guidance, I feel personally fortunate to have the chance to work closely with an accomplished and knowledgeable guide, making this position one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had in my LIS program. And finally, to our Editorial Board, led by Director Sandra Hirsh and Associate Director Linda Main, and to all the faculty and staff at the iSchool, we thank you for your continued support. 9et al.: Student Research Journal, Vol.8, Iss.2Published by SJSU ScholarWorks, 2019 11School of Information Student Research JournalVolume 8 | Issue 2 Article 2January 2019Who Votes for Libraries?Patrick SweeneyEveryLibrary, patrick.sweeney@everylibrary.orgFollow this and additional works at: https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/slissrjPart of the American Politics Commons, Collection Development and Management Commons,and the Scholarly Publishing CommonsAcknowledgements.This article is brought to you by the open access Journals at SJSU ScholarWorks.

In 2008 the OCLC released its report “From Awareness to Funding: A Study of Library Support in America,” which was a groundbreaking study on voter, funder, and advocate attitudes and behaviors about libraries. Through a series of public surveys and focus groups, the OCLC unearthed the first, and still the richest, profile of what motivates people to support a library, and what demographic characteristics matter when segmenting the public into Super Supporters, Probable Supporters, and other categories. While the research work in “From Awareness to Funding” was done before the Great Recession, before President Obama, before the Tea Party, and before the presidency of Donald Trump, much of the data about the voters themselves that the report uncovered has remained surprisingly consistent since publication. `In 2018 the OCLC and the American Library Association collaborated on a second study about voter behavior and support for libraries. This report has come ten years after the original 2008 study and is entitled “From Awareness to Funding: Voter Perceptions and Support of Public Libraries in 2018.” While the original study looked at the awareness, attitudes, and underlying motivations of American voters for supporting library funding, this new report was significant because it was the first time that anyone had looked at the voters’ shifting attitudes about library funding. With two reports, ten years apart, we finally have insight into the changing trends of voter attitudes about libraries and not just a single-study snapshot. Unfortunately, the trend that was discovered was an indication that library funding through ballot measures is at risk because voters are now far less likely to vote “yes” for libraries than they were ten years ago. In fact, we lost about 16 percent of our strongest supporters. In my work at EveryLibrary, I have found that the conclusions from the study are almost identical to what we see in the field during library campaigns. EveryLibrary is the first and only National Political Action Committee for libraries. Our work is primarily focused on helping libraries win local elections. This work is critical because over 90% of library funding is dependent on the will of local voters and local politicians. In the last six years, we have worked on nearly 100 campaigns, and in many cases, we are able to run local public opinion polling that asks similar questions to those in the OCLC study. In each of those public opinion polls we find that there are some outlying data points that reflect some of the local issues in politics, but for the most part, we have seen a measurable decline in voter willingness to vote yes for libraries. This should be significantly disturbing to our industry because without that voter support for library funding, libraries will no longer have the resources to keep their doors open. In order to maintain our funding, we need to understand who votes for libraries and why Americans support libraries at the ballot box. Without answering those questions, we will never be able to reverse the trends in declining support on election day. The 2008 and 2018 “From Awareness to Funding” studies have provided us with a series of guideposts to identify people in every kind of community who are predisposed to help but have not yet been activated in support of the library. 11et al.: Student Research Journal, Vol.8, Iss.2Published by SJSU ScholarWorks, 2019 3These guideposts are important because we can align our marketing, outreach, and networking to first identify and then activate those supporters well ahead of a ballot measure. These potential supporters hold views about libraries as an institution, about the librarians themselves, and they even share a common worldview, outlook, or attitude. These views are cultural and philosophical attitudes that cut across demographic boundaries and supersede party affiliations. In the 2008 “From Awareness to Funding” report, the research identified a set of “shared values and beliefs” among the people who make up the Probable Supporter and the Super Supporter segments: • They are involved in their communities. • They recognize the library’s importance to the community and to children’s education. • They are not always heavy users of the library, but they believe the library is a noble place, and one that is important and relevant to the community.  • They see the library as a vital community resource like public schools, fire departments, and police, and they are willing to increase their taxes in order to support the library. • They recognize the value of a “passionate librarian” as a true advocate for lifelong learning.  Let us look at each of these shared characteristics in detail.  They are involved in their communities.  When we present this key voter characteristic to a library leadership team, they usually look around the room and think “Well, this is all of us then.” We have to remind them that library supporters do not necessarily have to be involved with the library in order to be supporters on Election Day. They simply have to be involved in their own community. This does not necessarily mean that they go to city council meetings or write letters to the editor about civic issues. It does mean that they have a “community of intention” that they care about. For example, it could be their volunteer work for a social organization or club, or it could be through their place of worship. Many of them are easily identified as members of the PTA or PTO, but we should not overlook the volunteer coaches, theater and arts families, band boosters, and after-school parents. In libraries, we have an advantage in identifying these people who are “involved with their communities” because so many of their intentional communities meet at the library and use the library. These people are relatively easy to find, and they are predisposed to hearing about how your budget or your building impacts their community. They also have empathy for other groups in the community that need a librarian too.   They recognize the library’s importance to the community and to children’s education.  We have a fairly robust vocabulary in libraries to talk about our impacts on pre-K, K−12, and lifelong learning in libraries. Librarians know the power of information 12School of Information Student Research Journal, Vol. 8, Iss. 2 [2019], Art. 5https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol8/iss2/5 4literacy. We understand that the crucial reason why we teach kids to read is so that they can read to learn. Summer reading has transformed into a Summer Learning program for so many libraries precisely because libraries are well-equipped to help bridge the Summer Gap. Library supporters are eager to hear about this high-impact work we do. They are primed to appreciate it, and they are willing to talk about better funding to extend it. Where we sometimes fail as library communities is to get beyond a great educational message and share what our impacts are on other populations. What we need to do to help our library ballot campaigns from the beginning is to articulate the importance of the library to the wider community. Too often, library leaders talk first and foremost about the library’s impact on education and on children to audiences that do not look at education as their primary mission. While we would like to think that everyone can understand and value the work librarians do with pre-K children, for many of the community-minded volunteers, supporters, and voters you are trying to activate, pre-K issues are simply not their main concern. The hidden strength of libraries is that we already do so many things for so many different types of voters that we should be ready, quickly, to tell better stories about this. Take, for example, how libraries should be marketing and highlighting their services to veterans in the lead-up to an election. Programs for veterans are integral parts of library services, but we know from our campaigns that this fact is not well known outside of the groups of voters who were directly served. Library leaders need to start marketing their services, and not just to voters who may need those services. In some towns, the number of vets who could use the service directly might be relatively small. In other localities, there are multiple generations of veterans in residence with different needs based on their age and their stage in the homecoming process. When marketing a new veteran-focused service to potential users, we would recommend talking with local chapters of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion or notifying clergy and counseling centers about a new high-impact program for returning vets. But we are also interested in seeing our libraries talk to voters who are not military themselves about how the local library supports their neighbors who served in the armed forces. It it not a heart-strings story, but as vets find what they need from librarians, you should record and retell those stories. The fact that the library supports veterans who are looking for work or continuing their education is a compelling story that non-users might want to know. It is a story about how we care for our own and about how a part of government is putting taxes to good, smart, leverage-able uses.  They are not always heavy users of the library, but they believe the library is a noble place, one that is important and relevant to the community.  Nothing in this finding indicates that the Probable or Super Supporters recognize the library’s importance to themselves personally or that they even use the library at all. This country is littered with library buildings named after families who were too rich to need what was inside the library itself. They donated money to the library even though they do not use it because they wanted to see libraries founded and built for the benefit of their community. While one could speculate that perhaps 13et al.: Student Research Journal, Vol.8, Iss.2Published by SJSU ScholarWorks, 2019 5Andrew Carnegie did what he did, so the mob would not rise up against him, we suspect that he was true to his word about why he donated so much to establish so many libraries. In the April issue of the Library Journal in the year 1900, Andrew Carnegie said this about funding libraries:  “I choose free libraries as the best agencies for improving the masses of the people, because they give nothing for nothing. They only help those who help themselves. They never pauperize. They reach the aspiring, and open to those the chief treasures of the world—those stored up in books.”  People from all walks of life donate money to build, furnish, and equip libraries even if they do not plan to be users. Whether you call your users “patrons,” “customers,” or “members” does not matter. The voter who is a user can certainly understand a marketing message about what a “yes” vote would mean to him or her. Nonvoters who are users who can understand this too, but we are not concerned with nonvoters if we are talking about library funding. We are concerned with voters who are non-users. These are the people in your community who will decide on the fate of the library ballot measure and who do not have any personal “What is in it for me?” perspective about the election because they do not utilize the library.  Those non-users who are “yes” voters for the library vote the way they do because they believe in the library as an institution, and in librarians as change agents. And they do not have any reasonable reason to believe the way that they do until we educate them about why they should believe in libraries. That’s because, having not been in the library since they themselves were children or teens, they lack a current awareness and understanding of the library. And yet they persist in their belief that something good, something noble even, happens there. They are willing to vote for the resources that librarians need to do good work at that important place. They cannot be appealed to on the basis of their own self-interest in improving the user experience. They do not have a user experience.  They need to be addressed by your campaign with an understanding—and an appreciation—that they are empathetic people.  We do not believe that this empathy makes them liberals or progressives in the current political usage any more than folks who are conservatives or independents lack empathy or compassion. In fact, nothing in either of the “From Awareness to Funding” reports’ data suggests any difference between traditional party affiliations or leanings for “conservatives” or “liberals” in their proclivity to vote for the library. There is little or no difference between the success or failure of library ballot measures between Red and Blue states over the last few years. The key differentiator about the Tea Party or Libertarians is not who they voted for at the top of the ticket in the last election, but instead is the fact that they hold a philosophy of government that does not include progressive taxation. They are not “against” the library and in fact, we have seen significant support for libraries come from those holding libertarian viewpoints when they are educated about the nature and benefits of library funding in an open and transparent way.  14School of Information Student Research Journal, Vol. 8, Iss. 2 [2019], Art. 5https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol8/iss2/5 6We need to understand that the margin of difference between a yes and no vote is not about voter demographics or political parties. It is about the way that librarians communicate with their communities of voters. Libraries must frame their communications from the earliest stage with this awareness in mind. First off, if all of your library marketing is set up to encourage people to become library users, we know that this will backfire. To require someone to become a library user in order to be a valid library supporter or voter can set up a very strong emotional barrier to their support. If your marketing is exclusively focused on non-users changing their behavior (by using the library) instead of validating their beliefs, you can run into two problems: people do not like to change their behaviors; and, if their beliefs are in conflict with your expectations, they will not like you. In the lead-up to Election Day, please do not require your non-users to start using the library. They do not need to experience your work firsthand in order to care about the work you do. They are capable of voting “yes” for the library without having a library card. That is why your communications around voting for libraries must focus directly on increasing support, and not on increasing library use in order to build support.   They see the library as a vital community resource like public schools, fire departments, and police, and they are willing to increase their taxes to support the library.  The phrase “willing to increase their taxes” is an indicator that any library ballot measure has a chance of success. It may be difficult under many circumstances to win a ballot measure, but given enough hard work and shrewd tactics, it is not impossible. It just takes campaigners who are committed to doing the hard work. Finding common ground for political outcomes is often described as the “art of the possible.” But if campaigners are unwilling to have a conversation about taxes that includes a simple openness to entertain a possible increase, then no budget or building referendum will ever get to the ballot. When libraries are unwilling to even discuss any increase in taxes, for any purpose whatsoever, then a library ballot measure really does become impossible. Remembering that some part of your electorate sees the library as a “vital community resource” means framing your conversations about the hopes you have and the outcomes you expect with the goal of winning over as many voters as possible who are at least open to considering the possibility of a tax increase and it is about having open, honest, and transparent conversations about taxes for libraries.  It is sometimes important to inform or remind folks in town that their neighbors are indeed willing to increase their own taxes in order to support their public library’s services and staff. You will need to do your own surveys and polls to determine the baseline extent of that willingness. In chapter 5 of our upcoming book from ALA Editions, “Before the Ballot,” from which this article was taken, we have a chapter entitled, “Library as Cause,” where we discuss the kinds of questions you need to ask to get answers about voter-willingness that will allow you to plan an effective information campaign. You can also look at more current resources than the 2008 OCLC report’s statistics for assurances that support does 15et al.: Student Research Journal, Vol.8, Iss.2Published by SJSU ScholarWorks, 2019 7indeed exist in America for its libraries. While the Pew Research Center’s surveys do not publish cross-tabulations on voter status, there is a consistent and stable body of public opinion data against which you can compare your local results. Another aspect of voters’ value perception of libraries as existing on a continuum with police and fire, parks and recreation, and schools is that each of those institutions is valued, by large chunks of the electorate, based on voters’ perceptions of them rather than on their personal experience with them. Each of those institutions has a record of service to the community. By way of example, the likely number of community members or voters who have had a personal experience with the police or fire department is probably relatively low. But the number of community members or voters who have a favorable perception of the police or fire department is likely to be pervasive. Public safety may have a reputation (positive or negative) in your community that it does not deserve, but the voters will, in the main, vote on public issues and support politicians when issues and leaders line up with their perceptions about—and not their personal experience of—safe communities. The voters’ perception of libraries as an institution matters in a similar way. Your library may or may not have a good reputation in town, but whatever reputation it has constitutes your record. If your voters are new to town and are not users, their reference point is the library from their hometown, as well as their abstract perception of “libraries.” You may not be in control of your own library’s record, but politicians run for office in one of two ways: on their own record or against their opponent’s record. If the politician is an incumbent, the message is: “re-elect me and I’ll continue to look out for you.” If the candidate is an insurgent, the message is: “get rid of that politician and elect me. I know how to do it right for you.” We suggest to library campaigns that they see their own record—the record for which voters are willing to talk about new taxes—as the incumbent’s record in the campaign. Library leaders need to make an early choice about either running a ballot measure “as the incumbent,” meaning that they will communicate about the measure as a way to extend or enhance their record of success; or they need to run “against” their own library because a successful ballot measure would correct problems in the library and improve outcomes for the community. We would argue that you can successfully run against the library’s record as the library when you are honest, engaged, and transparent about what you are trying to fix. The local opposition will always reference your library’s record when messaging against a vote. We firmly believe that you need to embrace your record as the incumbent and define how you want to run the campaign messaging—“extend success” or “fix problems”—or the opposition will define it for you.  They recognize the value of a “passionate librarian” as a true advocate for lifelong learning.  The last key OCLC takeaway is a critical insight into voter perception that we do not think has penetrated far enough into the thinking and behavior of the library industry, or into the library advocacy ecosystem. The idea that voters have a 16School of Information Student Research Journal, Vol. 8, Iss. 2 [2019], Art. 5https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol8/iss2/5 8perception of the library as an institution is really well understood within the library community. All of our marketing and outreach is designed around the “library.” From the @yourlibrary campaign to “Geek the Library” to Libraries Transform, our advocacy campaigns have emphasized the noun library. It may be the library as a place, the library as a lifestyle, or the library as an idea. But that isn’t the only noun we need. We also need to talk about the librarians. A critical takeaway for library leaders going to the ballot is that the library itself is only part of what is being voted on. The voters’ recognition of librarians as passionate, engaged, and impactful people in their community is also on the ballot. The institutional incumbent record is being considered by the voters, but so are the humans who work there. We need to have a conversation about librarians that updates non-users’ image of librarians. While the OCLC’s study’s findings that we discussed are interesting and shed some light on voter support for libraries, we still have a lot of work to do to really begin understanding how to engage voters, so they support our organizations. These early studies were very useful because they began a dialogue that is long overdue in our industry. However, we still need to begin to understand how to segment these voters into their various demographics so that we can begin to have better conversations with them. Neither the 2008 study or the 2018 study provided that level of demographic data about our supporters. But now that we know why people might support libraries at the ballot box, our next step will be to begin to understand who supports libraries at the ballot box. We begin to explore this more in the book from which this article was excerpted. You can find it on the ALA Editions website or on Amazon.

W. (2016). Characteristics of articles coauthored by researchers and practitioners in library and information science journals. The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 42(5), 535-541. doi:10.1016/j.acalib.2016.06.021 Abstract Objective – To determine whether researcher and practitioner collaboration has increased over time, as well as what sort of research such collaborators conduct.  Design – Bibliometric and content analyses Setting – English LIS journals from 1995 to 2014  Subjects – 2241 articles Methods – Chang conducted a review of bibliographic records of research articles published in six journals between 1995 and 2014.  The authors of these articles were divided into three categories: researchers, practitioners, and students.  In terms of article research subjects, they were consolidated into 58 relevant subjects, which were further consolidated into 15 broad research subjects.  At each step, articles which lacked the relevant information were excluded.  A total of 2241 articles were examined.   Main Results – Chang tracked longitudinal changes for five article types based on authorship, with particular attention to articles coauthored by researchers and practitioners.  Change notes that while single authorship has an overall downward trend, all forms of collaborative authorship have risen.  The increase was not as pronounced for researcher and practitioner coauthorship, but the author concludes that this increase is evidence of a narrowing divide between researcher and practitioner.  In terms of research subjects, Chang identified users and user services as the topic most likely to be coauthored by researchers and practitioners.     Conclusion – Based on the article analysis, Chang concludes that researcher-practitioner coauthorship is likely to increase in the future, though the trend is only slightly increasing in current research literature.  For this reason, Chang indicates that further research and follow-up studies are necessary in order to determine if this trend continues or intensifies.  In order to promote researcher-practitioner collaboration, Chang notes the research subjects most popular for these types of coauthorships, specifically technical services and user services.  20School of Information Student Research Journal, Vol. 8, Iss. 2 [2019], Art. 5https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol8/iss2/5 2Future research could concentrate on expanding the research base beyond the initial six English LIS journals.  Commentary  Chang provides an overview of the coauthorship trends present in LIS scholarly literature, though she acknowledges that the scope of the study is limited and requires a broader analysis to draw more general conclusions.  Chang builds on a strong foundation of research in this field, drawing on a series of similar bibliographic and content analyses to design the data collection procedure.  The study is intended for both practicing and researching librarians or those interested in research collaboration.    The research questions are clearly defined, though the inclusion of both author and subject analyses can cause difficulty in determining how the two research questions are related to each other.  There is not a clear relationship between the two sets of data aside from identifying the next steps in promoting researcher-practitioner partnerships. The statistical analysis of each category is thorough, carefully documented, and explained, as evidenced by Tables 3 and 4 (Chang, 2016).  The section on data processing and analysis includes specific information about what was excluded and why.  This section also offers clear definitions of terms as they are used within the framework of data collection. These definitions follow the model that Glynn (2006) suggests in her critical appraisal tool, a checklist for evidence-based library research.     Watson-Boone (2000) and Aytac and Slutsky (2014) provide a framework for evaluating library research.  According to their guidelines (Watson-Boone, 2000; Aytac & Slutsky, 2014), the main concern with this study is the way in which the conclusion is drawn and how it relates to the data.  Analysis of the coauthor relationships in the data set points to only a slight increase in researcher-practitioner collaboration; however, Chang asserts that this modest increase confirms that the researcher-practitioner divide is narrowing.  At the same time, the data points out stronger trends among the other types of collaboration that were not the focus of this study. While Chang does acknowledge that further research needs to be conducted, she also makes assumptions about how the trend will continue based on cited sources that indicate where other scholars feel it should continue, not necessarily reflecting the actuality of the data presented.

As part of this critique, Zinn (1977) asserted that the archive is biased towards the collection and preservation of materials produced by, and related to, people deemed important. This bias means “we learn most about the rich, not the poor; the successful, not the failures; the old, not the young; the politically active, not the politically alienated; men, not women; White, not Black; free people rather than prisoners; civilians rather than soldiers; officers rather than enlisted men” (Zinn, 1977, p. 21). Zinn’s criticism generated much introspective thought within the profession and subsequent discussion that continued over time. Historian and archivist Randall Jimerson (2007) roused this sentiment again by asserting the moral responsibility of archivists to give equal voice in the archive to those who have been silenced. The Society of American Archivists (2017) now promotes policies intent on increasing and valuing diversity within membership, leadership, the profession, and archival records. This criticism and discussion has resulted in many institutions focusing their appraisal policies on diversifying the archive through the collection of marginalized histories.  It is important to note that while marginalized communities have often lacked representation in the institutional archive, these communities have been actively preserving their own cultures and history outside of the institution. Grassroots African American and gay and lesbian archives provide a few examples of marginalized communities archiving their own histories (Cvetkovich, 2003; Gibbs, 2012). Bringing diverse materials into the archive is not in and of itself an inclusive act, particularly when it can mean just “blindly accessioning records related to a specific race or ethnicity” (Gibbs, 2012, p. 203). Traditional, Western, and Eurocentric standards for appraising, collecting, and processing of archival materials are problematic. To truly address issues of diversity in the archive, the methodologies and methods valued in the profession need to change.  The rise of social activism and postmodern theory in the 1960s forced the archival field to reevaluate its supposed state of neutrality (Ridener, 2009). Postmodernism is an ambiguous, unstable, and difficult concept to define, changing based on who may be discussing it and within what context. Some attributes of postmodernism–the scrutiny of all-encompassing metanarratives, disbelief in communication or knowledge being neutral or unmediated, and a general attack on all forms of authority–are all concepts inherent in a critical rethinking of the archive (Nesmith, 2002; Ridener, 2009). Approaching the archival field with a postmodern view is to be aware of the social construct and power driving institutions and archives. Terry Cook (2001), like others, leans on postmodernism in his call for a shift in archival science focus from product to process, pushing back against the popular “more product, less process” (Greene & Meissner, 2005). Affect theory, radical empathy, and queer theory are theoretical frameworks that favor a process over the product paradigm and present means to practice a more inclusive, diverse archive. These methodologies reimagine the archive as a space for the collection of feelings rather than just the collection of History with a capital “H.” The destruction of archive neutrality not only affects the institution concretely, but also conceptually. 24School of Information Student Research Journal, Vol. 8, Iss. 2 [2019], Art. 5https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol8/iss2/5 6 However, in a contemporary context, it may be more appropriate to push the theoretical embrace of today’s archive past the confines of postmodernism. The end of postmodernism has been intermittently heralded since the closing decades of the 20th century, though its death may be better described as a gradual, vacillating shift of ideas which has accelerated since moving into the 2000s. Metamodernism is one development birthed from the ashes of postmodernism, which is proposed here as a more appropriate means for contextualizing the dynamism that affect theory, radical empathy, and queer theory bring to the archive. These theories value feeling, emotion, and human rights in the archive working in tandem with metamodernism’s emphasis on affect, engagement, and storytelling (Levin, 2012). The metamodern focus on consideration and connection more readily describes the social justice work performed in the archive through affect theory, radical empathy, and queer theory. Theorizing an Inclusive Archive Affect, like postmodernism, is an ambiguous and often conflicting term for which no consensus exists (Cifor, 2016; Figlerowicz, 2012). It stages the archive for the collection of feelings. Affect theory addresses concerns integral to thinking critically about the archive, those of representation, identity, accountability, and empowerment (Cifor, 2016). An affective archive better reflects the tumultuous history of marginalized communities than data or demographic records. Soliciting donations of personal, everyday materials is a way to practice affect theory and perform emotional justice in the archive (Cifor, 2016). The Lesbian Herstory Archives (LHA) does so by encouraging a participatory collecting process, which asks for the donation of items any lesbian may consider a critical part of her life (Cvetkovich, 2003). This participatory process empowers marginalized individuals to recognize the value of their histories and asserts the importance of archiving all lives (Cvetkovich, 2003).   In an archive of feelings, archivists must engage empathically with the community they are archiving, entering into a relationship of care with the record creators, the subject of the records, its users, and the larger community (Caswell & Cifor, 2016). In this sense, the archivist is not indebted to the inanimate record, but rather to the larger human context that is in some way touched by the record. Radical empathy does not erase power dynamics; rather, it forces archivists to be aware of and acknowledge inequalities in the archive (Caswell & Cifor, 2016). It is not enough for marginalized communities to be heard; instead, they must be heard justly, which reiterates the statement that blindly accessioning materials based on ethnicity or gender does not constitute the building of a diverse archive (Cifor, 2016). For a marginalized community to be heard justly, the archivist must take on an affective responsibility, a caregiver role, providing important emotional, contextual history to the archive. Ignoring the violent and subjugated history of marginalized communities in the archive is just a repetition of these violent acts (Cifor, 2016). The archivist must acknowledge the implications of the institution and the profession in the pain and erasure of marginalized communities and histories. 25et al.: Student Research Journal, Vol.8, Iss.2Published by SJSU ScholarWorks, 2019 7 Queer methodology presents another way to challenge dominant paradigms in the archive. Queerness can be characterized as indeterminate and fluid, aligning itself with earlier discussions surrounding the instability of the postmodern and metamodern archive (Jagose, 1996). Queer theory examines the concept of identity and its supposed stability, exposing the fragile construct of identity (Watson, 2005). It is another framework for pushing back against historical and cultural elements that may be declared the “norm” (Watson, 2005). This question and struggle with identity is not limited to mainstream society but can also be an issue in marginalized communities. For example, limiting an identity to the label of “gay” or “lesbian,” “heterosexual” or “homosexual,” denies the layered and multifaceted identities of many individuals.  Jamie Ann Lee’s (2017) Queer/ed archival methodology places the dynamic principles of queer theory in juxtaposition to the idea of a fixed and stable archive. Abbreviated as Q/M, this methodology reacts against the traditional archive through an unhinging of hierarchical knowledge. Q/M places emphasis on the imagination of an archival space that can hold competing histories, even those outside of the archivist’s known perspective (Lee, 2017). Oral histories in the Arizona Queer Archives presents examples of these competing histories, showcasing the multiple identities queer bodies can be associated with and emphasizing the nomadic and metamorphic possibilities of both queer and archival bodies (Lee, 2017). Q/M is based on seven principles: a participatory ethos, connectivity, storytelling, intervention, reframing, reimagining, and flexibility/dynamism (Lee, 2017). Though exact terminology and definitions may vary, these focuses are similarly reflected through an affect archive and the act of radical empathy. The malleability of the queer/ed archive allows for the collection of contradictory, lived histories and continual, evolving metamorphosis in the archive. Affect theory, radical empathy, and queer theory mark the archive as a space inseparable from social justice and politics. These methodologies value emotion and are in direct contrast to the traditional archive field, which is rooted in the scientific, objective, and unemotional facts. Approaching the field with new theoretical frameworks helps to address issues of diversity in the archive, but inclusive practices are also essential to complement theory. Practicing an Inclusive Archive Valuing Oral Histories Oral histories play an important role in bringing affect and queer methodology into the archive. While oral history has not always been valued as a form of historical record, its appreciation in the archive has grown within the past decades (Erdmans, 2007). Oral histories defy the traditional and scientific methods often used for historic preservation. Narratives allow for sentimentality, often negatively viewed as non-objective and unscientific. At the same time, however, sentimentality allows deeper meanings to be created in the archive (Erdmans, 2007). Oral history lends itself to the affective, to a state of practicing radical empathy and a feminist ethics of care with its subjects. E. Patrick Johnson (2016), a cisgender, Black gay man collecting the stories of cisgender Black queer 26School of Information Student Research Journal, Vol. 8, Iss. 2 [2019], Art. 5https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol8/iss2/5 8women, focused his research on oral histories because through “the act of performing one’s life history, the self is affirmed through the interaction with another who bears witness to the story being told” (p. 63). Collecting oral histories as artifacts in the archive allows for increased inclusivity and more diverse representations in the archive (Johnston, 2001).  In order to embrace oral history, researchers must first accept its inherently subjective nature (Erdmans, 2007). A handful of narratives may not accurately summarize a distinct lived experience, while at the same time, an archival space may hold competing stories (Erdmans, 2007). Queer theory’s application to oral history means reading the narrator’s voice in a similar manner to the way one would read a text, open to interpretation (Boyd, 2008). As queer theory supports, arriving at one, all-encompassing lived experience, proclaimed as fact and history, should not be the goal of the archive. The conflict and fluidity oral histories provide the archive better represent the reality of lived human experience and align with metamodern characteristics of oscillation. Similarly, the written word, heralded as truth, must be acknowledged as coming from a position of privilege. The Western world’s emphasis on the written word as a testament of history is not universally practiced or praised by all cultures. Rejecting oral history as a valid part of historical collections is a rejection of cultures where literacy and written records do not figure prominently. Nevertheless, these cultures may offer rich, well-endowed oral traditions (Hagan, 1978; Johnston, 2001).  The Houston Metropolitan Research Center (HMRC), housed in the city’s public library, relies heavily on oral histories as an integral component of the archive (Kreneck, 1985). In some instances, oral histories may be the only way to document an event that only still exists through memory (Kreneck, 1985). For example, theWoodmen of the World, one of Houston’s earliest Mexican-American community institutions, lacks records and documentation (Kreneck, 1985). Through interviews with some of its first members, archivists were able to shed light on the organization and its mission (Kreneck, 1985). The HMRC project made a conscious effort to supplement all items in the collection with oral histories, bestowing oral histories with as much importance as the physical records in the collection. Community Archiving   Scholar’s view archives as the custodial spaces of history and its artifacts, a model which predicates ownership, power, and control. To negate this, many organizations have moved towards a model of stewardship. These institutional archives work cooperatively with the communities whose histories they are preserving by providing stable infrastructure, training, and technological support.  The University of Texas Libraries (UTL) Human Rights Documentation Initiative works under a stewardship model, and as an archive created to preserve and provide access to records about human rights conflicts, is responsible for practicing affect, radical empathy, and a feminist ethics of care in the archive. Initially, organizations, composed of both national and international groups, were hesitant to give up documents of intense symbolic and memorial value (Kelleher, 27et al.: Student Research Journal, Vol.8, Iss.2Published by SJSU ScholarWorks, 2019 92017). Organizations recognized the benefits UTL could offer in regards infrastructure and funding, but the value of these documents to local communities was not something that could be easily dismissed. Collaboration under a stewardship model created an environment that was able to better support and benefit everyone involved. UTL was flexible in its stewardship role, customizing practices to the different needs and desires of the various organizations. While some organizations wanted their materials to remain directly in UTL’s care, others wanted to be their own archival repositories. For organizations of the latter type, UTL provided the funding and training (for the care and digitization of collections) directly to organizations and their local communities, while UTL accepted digital surrogates of materials for their repository (Kelleher, 2017).  Despite a more collaborative approach, this work is not without contention. The institution struggled with images representing human rights victims and survivors. While UTL gathered permission for use of these images from human rights organizations, they were unable to enter into a dialogue regarding use with the individual subjects or families of those reflected in the images (Kelleher, 2017). Procedures have been changed to use such materials less frequently, but use has not stopped altogether (Kelleher, 2017). Critical to the practice of radical empathy in the archive is UTL’s continual reflection and examination of the actions and motives in the archive.  The HMRC project (1985) relied heavily on community participation during the archival process. Many of the materials the HMRC sought were of a personal or ephemeral nature, privately held by families and individuals in the community (Kreneck, 1985). The personal nature of these materials made community outreach crucial for the collection of archival materials. Gaining the trust of the community was a difficult task, as under the status quo, marginalized communities are often the victims of domination and subjugation. Partnering with local Houston media, particularly focused on the Mexican-American community, the HMRC was able to solicit community volunteers to help with technical abilities, like Spanish language skills, and garner more community support for the program (Kreneck, 1985). Engaging volunteers from the community in this manner builds trust and helps break through a community’s often well-founded insularity (Johnston, 2001). Collaborative archiving does not always have to take place within the institutional archive. Many grassroots community archives are located in makeshift or do-it-yourself (DIY) spaces.  Community archives are symbolic, as they create a fixed space for communities that were often unwelcome and pushed out of mainstream spaces. These spaces then become an assertion of the community’s rights to existence and validation of their history (Caswell, Gabiola, Zavala, Brilmyer, & Cifor, 2018). No matter where a community archive is situated, it should not be entirely driven by its physical space, but by the community’s involvement (Stevens, Flinn, & Shepherd, 2010). The support of volunteers motivated by political activism and community engagement is a testament to the importance of community archives.  Community archives built outside of mainstream institutions can provide a feeling of home and comfort to researchers and community members (Caswell et al., 2018). They are described by users as spaces that provide a sense of belonging 28School of Information Student Research Journal, Vol. 8, Iss. 2 [2019], Art. 5https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol8/iss2/5 30(Caswell et al., 2018). Many grassroots gay and lesbian archives began in the safe and intimate space of individual homes (Cvetkovich, 2003). Queer identifying archivist Marika Cifor (2016) describes her experience entering the Lesbian Herstory Archives for the first time as “one of her most powerful archival encounters” (p. 38). This homey welcome into the archive, which in the instance of the LHA is literally inside the caretaker’s home, is situated within the practices of affect theory. It establishes the archive as a space for feeling and emotion over just providing space for an intellectual transaction (Caswell & Cifor, 2016).   Visibility and access are often of vital importance in community archives; the Beamish Museum in England provides preservation and storage for community collections without impinging on the community’s ownership or access. “Heritage cubes” are available to local organizations in addition to a shared collection study room and trainings on collection care (Stevens et al., 2010, p. 65). These heritage cubes are only accessible by the public or the museum with permission from local organizations, placing power and control in the hands of the organization, not the institution.  The collection of oral histories and engagement in community archiving practices are two ways to work towards a more diverse, inclusive, and participatory archive. The concept of a participatory archive is crucial for implementing and practicing affect theory, radical empathy, and queer theory in the archive. Working cooperatively with communities presents unique challenges to the traditional archive and archivist but provides direct action to combat the subjugation of marginalized histories. Flexibility and adaptability present themselves as characteristics key to the creation of a diverse and inclusive archive, which relies heavily on the transitory nature of contemporary, metamodern thought. Conclusion Ultimately, the archival field must decide what is at stake when clinging to traditional theories and processes and whether it is worth it to shift to a model emphasizing a more engaging and inclusive process over the product itself. If the archival field is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in the archive, it must wholly embrace emerging and evolving theories and practices that deviate from tradition. Critical thinking has led to a deeper awareness of bias in the field and has promulgated some positive change. Siding with the argument that the postmodern moment has passed, the methodologies and methods for archival practice presented in this paper should be considered in the context of new and evolving theoretical thought. The activist archivist fits more appropriately within the sincere and pragmatic idealism presented in the contemporary paradigm of metamodernism than the apathy, disaffection, and cynicism of postmodernism (Vermeulen & Akker, 2010; Akker & Vermeulen, 2017).  The definition of “meta,” as “with,” “between,” and “beyond,” befittingly depicts the oscillating nature of the methodologies and methods presented in this paper. Metamodernism fluctuates between the enthusiasm of the modern and the irony of the postmodern (Vermeulen & Akker, 2010). An aware archive, focused on the promotion of social justice, is aware of its flaws and biases, while still 29et al.: Student Research Journal, Vol.8, Iss.2Published by SJSU ScholarWorks, 2019 31being hopeful and forward-looking. Not contemplating the archive outside of postmodern thought would mean a resignation to its inequalities. Future and continuing research should place the archive within metamodern thought. The discussion of archival theory and practice evolving over the past few decades has pushed the field beyond an acceptance of inequality towards a critically conscious, politically active archive space, which will only continue to challenge the hierarchy established by the traditional status quo.                                         30School of Information Student Research Journal, Vol. 8, Iss. 2 [2019], Art. 5https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/ischoolsrj/vol8/iss2/5 2References  Akker, R. & Vermeulen, T.
