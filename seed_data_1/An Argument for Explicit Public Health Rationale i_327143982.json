SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW  147 AN ARGUMENT FOR EXPLICIT PUBLIC HEALTH RATIONALE IN LGBTQ ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAW AS A TOOL FOR STIGMA REDUCTION HEATHER A. WALTER-MCCABE* AND M. KILLIAN KINNEY** ABSTRACT The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (inclusive of nonbinary), and queer (collectively, LGBTQ) community is experiencing health inequities at alarming rates. From behavioral health issues, to violence issues, to increased rates of homelessness, structural stigma impacts LGBTQ communities at a disproportionate rate. Suicide numbers are particularly concerning. The LGB community rate of suicide is two to three times that of the general population. For the transgender and nonbinary community, that number soars to nearly nine times that of the general population. In this article, we examine the social determinates of health impacting the LGBTQ community and the ways structural stigma supports health inequity. Given the health data, the article analyzes how policymakers could include an explicit rationale in antidiscrimination laws to shift social norms and lower stigma in pursuit of improving population health. Even when a policy is anti-discriminatory on its face, naming the intent of shifting norms and lowering stigma matter. When the explicit rationale is named, it can serve two purposes: 1) articulating a clear public health purpose of the antidiscrimination law and 2) educating the public on the need for norm change and its public health impact. Making it clear that the goal of social norm change is to protect and improve the population’s health may make the state’s compelling state interest case stronger, particularly in the face of Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, in challenges to antidiscrimination laws.    * Heather A.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 148 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 13:147 I.  INTRODUCTION The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (inclusive of nonbinary), and queer (collectively, LGBTQ1) community is experiencing suicide at alarming rates.2 The LGB community rate of suicide is two to three times that of the general population.3 For the transgender and nonbinary community, that number soars to nearly nine times that of the general population.4 Research supports that stigma is a structural determinant of health that contributes to harmful mental and physical health outcomes, especially among LGBTQ communities.5  The public health community is increasingly examining and seeking to impact not only the social determinants of health, but also the structural determinants of health—those health disparities at the institutional and policy levels impacting communities.6 This is an important shift in conceptualizing the issues that may assist in making broad improvements to health inequities. Given what we know about stigma, built on a strong foundation of research from public health, mental health, and stigma scholars, it time for public health to move one step further.7 Generally, antidiscrimination laws move the public’s behaviors   1. In this article, the term LGBTQ will be used as inclusive of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (inclusive of those who are nonbinary), and Queer or Questioning (inclusive of those who self-identify as queer or others who are generally included in this community but not well covered by the other categories such as asexual, pansexual, genderqueer, or others). If other letters are used, it is based on the scope of the work referenced or is an intentional discussion of only one portion of the overall community.  2. See NAT’L LGBT HEALTH EDUC.

This article will be divided into four sections. First, we will examine the wealth of knowledge on LGBTQ health inequities, with a particular examination of suicide. Second, we will discuss stigma and its role in the population health of the LGBTQ community. Third, we will discuss the rationale for a call to increase the inclusion of a public health purpose in LGBTQ antidiscrimination laws. Lastly, we will examine current research projects that will assist in understanding the impact of law and policy on structural stigma in the LGBTQ community.  II.  BACKGROUND ON LGBTQ HEALTH INEQUITIES A. LGBTQ Demographics LGBTQ individuals have long experienced health inequities in a variety of areas.9 In the 2020 Healthy People agenda, the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP), for the first time, included a goal for improving the health, safety, and wellbeing of LGBT individuals.10 The agenda recognizes areas of need for promoting the public’s health.11 In 2011, the Institute of Medicine released a report entitled The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and  Public Health Law, 30 J.L.

While this article focuses on suicide in the LGBTQ community, it is crucial to understand the context within which these suicides are occurring. Below is a broad description of the overall health inequities experienced by this community that provides an understanding of the environment within which these suicides occur. Despite increased protection for LGBTQ individuals ensured by the Affordable Care Act,13 one study suggests that over half of LGBTQ people in America have experienced discrimination in health care, from harsh interactions, to abusive language, to the refusal of care.14 In that study, seventy percent of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals experienced discrimination, including physical roughness, harsh language, refused care, and ignorance of their health care needs.15 Further, ninety percent of individuals who identified as transgender reported experiencing barriers to care due to concerns about lack of adequately trained professions, eighty-six percent reported fear of different treatment, and over fifty percent expressed concerns about refusal of services.16 1. Behavioral Health LGBTQ persons are at enormous risk for behavioral health issues.17 Depression, anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD, and substance use disorder have all been found to be experienced at higher rates in the LGBTQ community.18 Of particular concern are LGBTQ youth, who are at higher risk for mental health concerns, substance abuse disorders, and poor overall health than youth than their heterosexual and cisgender peers.19 In a 2008 study, depression, anxiety, alcohol and substance misuse were found to be experienced by the LGBTQ   12.

Disease Disparities The ODPHP lists multiple health disparities in the LGBTQ population.25 As with other areas, there are differences within the community itself.26 The LGBTQ community is at an increased risk for tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use.27 Lesbian and bisexual women are at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer due to avoidance of preventative care (i.e., mammograms and   20.

Due to the historical use of the word “queer” as a derogatory term, some older LGBTQ folx do not use it. Others do. While many within the LGBTQ community have reclaimed “queer” as an empowering label, we have dropped the “Q” out of recognition that some older generations do not self-identify as “queer” in light of historical discrimination. Because use of the term “queer” has since shifted toward empowerment, it is thus used throughout the rest of the article.  44.

Violent Injury Violence is another area that disproportionately impacts the LGBTQ community, with differences between groups within the LGBTQ community.48 For example, higher rates of verbal and physical abuse have been found for LGBTQ youth compared to their heterosexual, cisgender peers.49 Taken together, LGBTQ school-aged youth, from elementary school to high school, report regular bullying within the school environment perpetrated by other students, staff, and administrators.50 A 2013 survey of LGBTQ students found that seventy-four percent were verbally harassed due to their sexual orientation, and fifty-five percent were verbally harassed due to their gender expression.51 Also, nearly fifty-six percent of LGBTQ students felt unsafe due to their sexual orientation, while thirty-eight percent felt unsafe due to their gender expression.52  These findings have been confirmed by another study that also found high rates of verbal and physical abuse experienced by LGBTQ youth.53 For youth, school environments can have a significant impact on safety.54 “It is not sufficient to simply address the presence or lack of homophobia in these systems, it is also imperative that heterosexism be examined.”55 Notably, in-school victimization experiences have been associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes through young adulthood.56   47.

Underreporting of hate crimes in the LGBTQ community unfortunately exists at even the most comprehensive national sources for data reporting. Considering the challenges of UCR, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), the U.S. Census Bureau’s household-based survey of perceived crimes by victims, has been recommended for more accurate and detailed reporting.71   64.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 164 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 13:147 II.  STIGMA THEORY AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT A. An Overview of Stigma Theory If stigma is contributing to poor public health outcomes, including death, then understanding and eliminating stigma is a necessary public health aim. In 1963, Ervin Goffman wrote a seminal study on stigma.107 He describes stigma as having an attribute that is “deeply discrediting.”108 His work described how stigma created conditions for both the person and others to view the person experiencing stigma.109 The work laid the groundwork for discussions of groups Goffman referred to as “normal” and those with a “spoiled identity.”110 The concept of a spoiled identity follows a person through all aspects of their life, from the social to the private, and ultimately takes a toll on the day-to-day lived experience of the person who experiences stigma.111  Following Goffman’s study, other theorists provided additional detail on how stigma worked in communities. Phelan and Link conceptualized stigma as a five-part phenomenon: labeling, stereotyping, separation, loss of power, and stigmatization or discrimination.112 The addition of the power component to Goffman’s work has proved compelling when considering the ways that laws are a part of, and sometimes even exacerbate, structural stigma against targeted populations.113  Stigma in public health law specifically is a growing area of research. A 2006 article by Bayer examines the use of stigma as a tool of public health.114 He uses smoking as an example of how stigma toward unhealthy behaviors can work to decrease the behavior in the population.115 Though he acknowledges the harm stigma can cause, here using the example of the gay population and HIV, he also posits that some forms may serve a public health goal even while creating ethical issues.116 Following Bayer’s article, Burris wrote a nuanced and thoughtful response to Bayer, reviewing the history of stigma research and its   107.

And chances are that it won’t work anyway.”118 Goldberg has also been a prolific writer on stigma and public health law.119 After synthesizing reviews of stigma research, he concludes, “Stigma is corrosive. It is capable of inducing intense psychosocial harm. It is a risk factor for suicide. Even when controlling for every conceivable confounder, members of groups subjected to persistent stigma get sicker and die quicker than comparators. It is therefore important both as a social problem and as a health problem.”120 He also discusses the ways that social policies may serve to impact stigma but cautions that more research is needed on how these policies do or do not change attitudes and behaviors, and he advocates for additional research in this area.121 B. Stigma Theory and LGBTQ Population Health The impacts of stigma specifically on LGBTQ populations is an important component of health inequity for the population. Meyer first discussed this concern in his work on Minority Stress Theory (MST).122 MST, as described by Meyer, considers the “excess stress to which individuals from stigmatized social categories are exposed as a result of their social, often a minority, position.”123 Meyer cites the work of Durkheim and the need for social norms versus a sense of normlessness as he discussed how minority stress can lead to the harms of suicide.124 Meyer labels three specific processes which are important to the LGBTQ community: “(a) external, objective stressful events and conditions (chronic and acute), (b) expectations of such events and the vigilance this expectation requires, and (c) the internalization of negative societal attitudes.”125 He goes on to discuss the harm that concealing one’s sexual orientation can cause.126   117.

His work has provided importing information on differences in suicide rates of LGBTQ youth that examines local level ecological factors,127 the impact of anti-bullying policy on the risk of suicide attempts in gay and lesbian youth,128 the impact of state-level policy on LGBTQ psychiatric morbidity,129 and other important measurements of how policy and other structural level mechanisms impact LGBTQ health.130 Additional research is needed to have a full understanding of the link between structural stigma, policy, and health outcomes. Blake and Hatzenbuehler published a 2019 call for additional research and research tools on this topic in an article entitled Legal Remedies to Address Stigma-Based Health Inequities in the United States: Challenges and Opportunities.131 The article reviews the studies which have implicated antidiscrimination laws as a driver of stigma or stigma alleviation.132 Further, they discuss the need to better understand the enforcement of such laws and the ways that courts are interpreting the laws and the impact that can have on health inequities.133 Lastly, they call for the creation of a new surveillance system of antidiscrimination laws to be used in such research.134 Below, we will present opportunities to address some of these needs.   127.

A CALL FOR INCREASED PUBLIC HEALTH RATIONALE FOR STIGMA REDUCTION IN LGBTQ ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAWS A. Say Its Name – An Argument for Inclusion of Anti-Stigma and Social Norm Change as a Public Health Rationale for Antidiscrimination Laws “Words have power in two kinds of ways: They have power when you speak them and power when you don’t.”135 We assert that it is time for policymakers to include an explicit rationale for antidiscrimination law to shift social norms and lower stigma for specific populations. Even when a policy is anti-discriminatory on its face, naming the intent of shifting norms and lowering stigma matters. When the explicit rationale is named, it can serve two purposes: 1) articulating a clear public health purpose of the antidiscrimination law and 2) educating the public on the need for norm change and its public health impact.  1. Expressive Function of Law Much has been written about an expressive theory of law, a theory that examines the “statement” made by the law, not necessarily the consequences given through enforcement of the law.136 For example, Sunstein, in his work On the Expressive Function of Law, examines the ways that laws serve to change social norms.137 He purports that antidiscrimination laws may be passed even when the specific impact on the targeted population may be unknown, writing, “The norm can do what the law would do at possibly much greater cost.”138 He asserts that the laws “signal” what behaviors are appropriate with or without enforcement activity attached.139 This type of signaling has been used in civil rights laws historically. The Civil Rights Law of 1964 both required enforceable behavior and acted as a signal that race-based discrimination would not be tolerated.140 In Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court appeared to endorse an expressive view of the law.141 In the case, the Court expressly discussed the psychological impact of a “separate but equal” approach, writing, “[t]o separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of   135.

As courts examine a state’s ability to enact public health legislation under the state’s police powers, the court will look at what type of interest the state has in enacting the measure and proposed response.145 We suggest that naming the goal of changing social norms and directly linking it to increasing positive health outcomes for the impacted population may strengthen the state’s ability to show a compelling state interest where necessary. This concept is discussed in more detail below. 2. Public Health Purpose and Communication Function Since Jacobson v. Massachusetts,146 the courts have consistently held that the states can legitimately exercise their police powers to protect the health and welfare of their citizens.147 Antidiscrimination laws are not new, though their rationale has neither explicitly included a public health rationale nor been framed as an exercise of police powers in this manner. The evidence of the negative impacts of discrimination and stigma on LGBTQ population health is well-documented.148 An Institute of Medicine report on the health of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people acknowledged the impact of discrimination on health as it examined MST.149 In Healthy People 2020, the   142.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2020] AN ARGUMENT FOR EXPLICIT PUBLIC HEALTH RATIONALE IN LGBTQ 169 CDC, for the first time, included goals for improving LGBTQ health, acknowledging the health inequities experienced by this community.150 Yet states have not added language regarding the potential health impact as they have chosen to enact antidiscrimination laws for the LGBTQ community.151  The states’ reasoning for enacting laws has an impact on their ability to withstand a challenge in court.152 Laws that provide protection to LGBTQ populations are not mandated by the federal government.153 As states have begun to provide these protections over the last few decades, they are increasingly being challenged as an infringement of religious rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by persons who do not wish to provide services to the LGBTQ community.154 In order to survive these challenges, a state must show it has a compelling state interest in enacting antidiscrimination protections.155 As stated above, public health interest may strengthen the state’s case.156 The Free Exercise Clause post-1963, the year Sherbert v. Verner157 was decided, has generally been interpreted to require a compelling state interest applied in the least restrictive means in order for a state to substantially burden a person’s religious liberty. In 1990, the Supreme Court, in Employment Division v. Smith, ruled that when the law is one of general applicability, the courts will rule in favor of the state as long as there is a rational relationship between the policy and the state’s interest.158 Given what the legislature saw as a change in course for the Court, though the Court sought to distinguish this case from Sherbert and other earlier rulings, Congress passed the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).159 RFRA codified the requirements of a compelling state interest applied in the least restrictive means for any state action   150.

Flores that RFRA is only applicable to the federal government.162  Since Boerne, twenty-one states have passed their own version of RFRA.163 Initial states passed state RFRAs reflective of the federal version.164 Importantly, later states began drafting their RFRAs specifically to allow persons to refuse to provides services to the LGBTQ community if they invoked a religious objection to providing such services.165 Following Elane Photography, LLC v. Vanessa Wilcox, a 2013 case where the New Mexico Supreme Court found that a photographer could not use her religious beliefs to deny services to a same-sex couple because the photographer’s actions where in violation of the state of New Mexico’s antidiscrimination law,166 states pointed to this case and the need to protect persons’ ability to practice their religious liberties in the way they felt necessary.  Notably, in 2015, Indiana worked to pass a broad religious freedom act that received nationwide attention.167 The law, signed by Governor Mike Pence in March 2015, was viewed by some as a license to discriminate.168 Boycotts by   160.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2020] AN ARGUMENT FOR EXPLICIT PUBLIC HEALTH RATIONALE IN LGBTQ 171 artists and sports teams were immediate.169 Business leaders made their concerns known.170 Within a month, the governor signed an amendment clarifying that the bill was not to be used to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or sexual identity.171 Following the amendment, some religious leaders expressed concern that the bill had been watered down, while others supported the changes.172 Regardless of an individual’s feelings about the laws, it is clear that for some, these bills are of specific concern to the LGBTQ community. Given the concern that state and federal RFRA laws may be used in a way that will harm the LGBTQ community, any laws meant to protect the LGBTQ community would be well advised to do everything possible to protect against possible RFRA challenges.173 Would the Court view a state goal of changing social norms as infringing on the free expression of a person’s religious beliefs if their beliefs go against the norm that the state expressed? Alternatively, would it strengthen the state’s case, making the change of stigma and discriminatory beliefs a more compelling interest, if the state specifically linked the change to increase health and safety for the impacted group?  As Sunstein reasons, constraints on government action are applicable in antidiscrimination policy as with other laws.174 He writes, “If government tried to change social norms so as to ensure that everyone is a Christian, it would violate the right to religious liberty; if government tried to change social norms so as to ensure that women occupy domestic roles, and men do not, it would   169.

It is important to note that there are legitimate uses of state RFRAs that have nothing to do with the LGBTQ population. Lund discusses the concern of “throwing out the baby with the bathwater” writing, “In the last five years, six more states have adopted state RFRAs, and in each case the Elane Photography issue was part of the debate. But Indiana was different. Now the debate seems to have nothing else left in it. One side sees Elane Photography as the raison d’être for state RFRAs; the other side sees it as the bête noire. But on both sides, Elane Photography is all that matters. An unfortunate consequence is that all the other kinds of state RFRA claims—including the sympathetic ones mentioned here—have gotten completely lost in the shuffle. For those interested in protecting free exercise without protecting the claim in Elane Photography, there are several options going forward. The first is the simplest and probably the best—one can, by statute, simply exclude for-profits. There is nothing path-breaking about this suggestion.” Christopher C. Lund, RFRA, State RFRAs, and Religious Minorities 53 SAN DIEGO L. REV. 163, 182 (2016).  174. See Sunstein, supra note 136, at 2048–50. SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 172 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 13:147 violate the Equal Protection Clause.”175 Making it clear that the goal of social norm change is to protect and improve the population’s health may make the state’s case stronger in enforcing antidiscrimination laws. There is reason to believe that changes in policy specifically to support changes in behavior and beliefs can impact population health. For example, in a 2013 study, Krieger et al. examined Black infant mortality rates in relation to the abolition of Jim Crow laws.176 The study compared Black infant mortality rates in states with and without Jim Crow laws before and after the laws were abolished. In the longitudinal examination of infant mortality rates, rates for Black infants improved in states with previous Jim Crow laws with “no comparable temporal patterns in Jim Crow birth cohort effects occur[ing] among White infants or… evident in Black versus White comparisons within these policies.”177 More studies of this kind will help to answer the question of correlation versus causation in structural stigma. More research regarding the public health impact of antidiscrimination laws on the LGBTQ community will strengthen any assertion of a public health imperative. The work of Hatzenbeuhler and other public health law scholars examining stigma will be an important component of ensuring meaningful inclusion of effective public health aims in these laws. IV.  POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR LGBTQ PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH A. LGBTQ Legal Epidemiology Project Given the relatively recent research on measuring the health impacts of anti-stigma law in general, and on the LGBTQ community in particular, more work is left to be done. To that end, data on laws and policies impacting the LGBTQ at the state and local levels will be needed. Currently, the public health community is working to increase the data collected regarding the sexual orientation and gender identity of persons on whom health outcomes data are collected.178 The CDC is driving this work with Healthy People 2020.179 In order to be able to examine these data in comparison with the laws and policies, more information is needed.  We are working to fill this need. Often, legal data collection contains information on where laws do and do not exist with some comparison between those jurisdictions. In order to consider the impact of laws on health outcomes data at the population level, information regarding enforcement mechanisms,   175. Id. at 2049.  176.

In conjunction with the CDC Public Health Law Program, we are working to collect information on state-level laws and regulations covering sexual orientation and gender identity using legal epidemiology methods.180 We will also collect information on state-level RFRAs. This information will be important for researchers who seek to examine the impact of laws on health outcomes for the LGBTQ community. Currently, some excellent programs disseminate information on LGBTQ laws.181 None, however, provide the level of detail needed to do the kinds of comparisons that will allow for a thorough analysis of the impact of laws, including which provisions of the laws appear to be most useful to improving LGBTQ health. B. Additional Considerations for Research As research moves forward, it will be important to consider the limitations to what we currently know and how we can improve knowledge on this topic. As stated above, researchers like Hatzenbuehler, Burris, and Goldberg are doing groundbreaking work in the area of structural stigma in the field of public health. There is a substantial collection of research that shows that stigma has a negative and pervasive impact on health. Furthermore, there is an increasing body of work that suggests structural stigma is a part of this process. The measurement of and research on structural stigma remain in their early stages. It will be important to distinguish between places where the policies are more favorable to the LGBTQ population, because in these places, societal attitudes are already generally supportive toward this population. Thus, in these places, policies can serve as tools to further favorably impact the beliefs and behaviors of the states’ populations.  V. CONCLUSION A call for action toward collective consciousness of daily discrimination and public health disparities faced by marginalized populations cannot be ignored. As described above, the cultural climate is influenced by the policies that are proposed and passed. These policies provide guidance for what is socially and legally acceptable and what is not, as reflected in evolving antidiscrimination laws. Given both the political reality embodied in discussion around RFRA laws   180. For more information on the legal epidemiology method, see Theory & Methods, TEMPLE U. CTR. FOR PUB. HEALTH L.

    "abstract": "The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (inclusive of nonbinary), and queer (collectively, LGBTQ) community is experiencing health inequities at alarming rates. From behavioral health issues, to violence issues, to increased rates of homelessness, structural stigma impacts LGBTQ communities at a disproportionate rate. Suicide numbers are particularly concerning. The LGB community rate of suicide is two to three times that of the general population. For the transgender and nonbinary community, that number soars to nearly nine times that of the general population. In this article, we examine the social determinates of health impacting the LGBTQ community and the ways structural stigma supports health inequity. Given the health data, the article analyzes how policymakers could include an explicit rationale in antidiscrimination laws to shift social norms and lower stigma in pursuit of improving population health. Even when a policy is anti-discriminatory on its face, naming the intent of shifting norms and lowering stigma matter. When the explicit rationale is named, it can serve two purposes: 1) articulating a clear public health purpose of the antidiscrimination law and 2) educating the public on the need for norm change and its public health impact. Making it clear that the goal of social norm change is to protect and improve the population’s health may make the state’s compelling state interest case stronger, particularly in the face of Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, in challenges to antidiscrimination laws",
