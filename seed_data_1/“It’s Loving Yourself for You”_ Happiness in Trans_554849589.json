This study contributes to this growing area of research by investigating one subjectively experienced aspect of well-being—happiness—among TNB adults residing in the central Great Plains region of the United States. For this study, 20 TNB adults participated in semistructured interviews where they were asked to re-flect on how they experienced happiness generally and in relation to being TNB, and what fostered or impeded their happiness.

Four major themes emerged from the data that formed the core components of happiness: Authenticity, Connection to Others, Perspective Shift, and Agency. Two additional major themes included fac-tors that fueled happiness and those that detracted from happiness. Subthemes and categories within each major theme are described. From these themes, a theoretical model of TNB happiness was developed. Theoretical and counseling implications are discussed, along with noted limitations and areas for future research. Public Significance: This study documents experiences of happiness, one impor-tant aspect of well-being, among TNB adults. Through qualitative data analysis, we identified factors that foster and impede happiness, and we extracted four major core components of happiness that participants’ experiences were centered on: Au-thenticity, Connection to Others, Perspective Shift, and Agency. Findings from the present study contribute to our knowledge of positive psychological functioning among TNB people. Keywords: well-being, authenticity, critical consciousness, positive psychology, promotive factors   For many trans and nonbinary (TNB) individuals, moving into a place of congruence with one’s gender, often through a social and/or medi-cal transition process, is a profound experience. The ability to see and be seen by others as who one truly is, perhaps for the first time, has been described by participants in previous qualitative research stud-ies as critical to well-being across a variety of contexts (Austin, 2016; Budge et al., 2010; Devor, 2004; Goffnett & Paceley, 2020). However, much of the extant research has aimed to identify the predictive fac-tors driving known health disparities (see Moradi et al., 2016), such as depression, anxiety, suicidality, and HIV prevalence, which are doc-umented at higher rates than what is typically found in cisgender populations (Budge et al., 2013; Herbst et al., 2008; Tebbe & Moradi, 2016). To date, research has linked numerous contextual factors, such as experiences of antitrans stigma (e.g., internalized attitudes, expe-riences of prejudice and discrimination) to these adverse health out-comes (Bockting et al., 2013; Budge et al., 2013; James et al., 2016; Tebbe & Moradi, 2016). Although such efforts are critical toward the development of prevention and intervention strategies aimed at ad-dressing TNB population health disparities, they are only one part of the larger picture of TNB mental health; less is known about both gen-eral and gendered experiences of thriving, happiness, and joy that are embodied within TNB individuals and communities. Therefore, the Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       3present study aims to fill this gap by investigating one critical aspect of well-being for TNB individuals—happiness—and the factors that foster and impede it. Theories of Happiness and Well-Being One major theoretical conceptualization of happiness is authentic hap-piness (Seligman, 2002, 2012). Although related to Seligman’s (2012) more expansive theory of well-being, which he titles the PERMA+ model—positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and achievement—Seligman’s authentic happiness theory centers only three different elements: positive emotion, engagement, and meaning. Posi-tive emotion comprises pleasure, joy, warmth, comfort, etc. Engagement is considered to be about flow —for example, engaging in the mindful-ness of the moment or the loss of self-consciousness during an activity that one might be absorbed in. According to Seligman, this concept is distinct from, even opposing of positive emotion, in that it is often ab-sent of emotion. The third element, meaning, consists of belonging to and being a part of something that is considered bigger than oneself. Other theorists, such as Winston (2016) have indicated that the most basic form of happiness can be a fleeting experience, one that is mo-mentary and rooted in pleasure and fun. As Winston (2016) describes, deeper levels of satisfaction, however, require cultivating meaning and greater emotional complexity around happiness. For example, instead of the most basic form of happiness where pleasure can be swayed by simple categorizations of good or bad, deriving meaning from connect-ing, belonging, and selfless ideals can lead to the formation and main-tenance of deeper levels and forms of happiness. In their systematic review of happiness research, Myers and Die-ner (2018) noted several facets that comprise happiness and identi-fied the factors that lead to happiness. In their review, they focused on research that addressed the following questions: (a) if there are spe-cific times of life that are happier than others (answer: there tends to be stability across the life span), (b) if there are gender differences in happiness (answer: women and men express similar levels of happi-ness globally, although studies notably adopt a binary and cisnorma-tive lens), and (c) if money makes people happier (answer: it does, to a point). They also examined traits of happiness, noting that there Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       4tend to be several traits that relate to happiness: pride, satisfaction with self, optimism, self-esteem, personal control, and extraversion. In addition to the components above, Myers and Diener (2018) note that on the whole, research focusing on happiness and wellbeing dem-onstrates how understanding and cultivating happiness can be bene-ficial to individuals and communities. For example, they note that the aggregated research finds that happy people tend to be healthier and live longer, have better relationships and have more friends, and are more prosocial and engaged citizens. Taking into consideration the scholarship on happiness and its intersections with well-being, in the present study, we aim to capture the breadth of happiness as psycho-logically constructed, from momentary experiences of positive emo-tions to deeper and longer-lasting connection to meaning, belonging, and other aspects of well-being. This approach is in line with previ-ous research and scholarship on social constructivist approaches to understanding emotion (Barrett & Russell, 2014) and their connection to identity among marginalized groups (e.g., Goffnett et al., 2022). Notably, theories that aim to conceptualize happiness—what it is, how and why it occurs, and what its effects are to longer-term social, mental, and physical health outcomes—have largely left out social identity processes that may reveal differences in the conceptualization of happiness across populations. The larger body of literature on well-being can provide some helpful direction for understanding how and where such differences occur. Specifically, in the larger body of liter-ature related to well-being, two major approaches to conceptualizing well-being have emerged: hedonic and eudaimonic approaches (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Hedonic approaches, or what Westerhof and Keyes (2010) refer to as emotional well-being, conceptualize well-being as the experience of pleasure versus displeasure, and as the subjective experience of happiness, satisfaction, and interest in life (Keyes, 2007; Waterman, 1993), similar conceptually in some ways to what Winston (2016) describes as momentary experiences of happiness. With its fo-cus on pleasure or displeasure, hedonic approaches have traditionally lacked emphasis on individual growth and optimal functioning. The other major approach to conceptualizing well-being is the eudaimonic approach, which has come to be referred to as psychological well-be-ing (PWB; see Westerhof & Keyes, 2010). PWB approaches call on indi-viduals to live in accordance with their true selves and to realize their Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       5full potential (Waterman, 1993). Six domains comprise PWB: self-ac-ceptance, purpose in life, autonomy, positive relations with others, en-vironmental mastery, and personal growth (Ryff, 1989; Ryff & Keyes, 1995). Although less explicitly central to PWB models than hedonic approaches, positive emotions have also been theoretically and em-pirically associated with PWB’s major domains. Finally, given that in-dividuals exist within social contexts, a distinct but related aspect of psychological well-being, optimal social functioning, was further con-ceptualized as being essential to eudaimonic well-being (Keyes, 1998; Westerhof & Keyes, 2010). Eudaimonic approaches to conceptualiz-ing well-being help to reveal how the larger sociopolitical context can shape how and the extent to which individuals who belong to mar-ginalized communities experience well-being. Specifically, in the con-text of systemic oppression, marginalization, and stigma, and discrim-inatory and microaggressive interpersonal interactions, individuals’ ability to express themselves authentically, to arrive to a place of self-acceptance, and to live to their full potential may be necessarily lim-ited, and instead be associated with adverse mental health outcomes (Tebbe & Moradi, 2016; Testa et al., 2015). On the other hand, finding authenticity and developing positive connections with others in the face of that oppression can be a particularly profound experience and contribute meaningfully to well-being (e.g., Austin, 2016; Goffnett et al., 2022; Singh, 2013). To advance knowledge in this area, research and scholarship must center the role of social identity factors and pro-cesses to accurately understand the role and impact of the larger so-ciopolitical context in conceptualizing well-being and happiness. Happiness and Well-Being in TNB People In research on well-being in TNB populations, happiness has not typically been the focus, though a few notable exceptions exist. In a study of the positive emotions trans men experienced as it related to their gender identity, participants described a wide range of positive emotions, including confidence, comfort, connection, feeling alive, amazement, pride, and happiness (Budge et al., 2015). Although hap-piness was labeled in their study as a discrete emotion, Budge and col-leagues also noted that participants described happiness as an inter-nal, overall emotional experience that was the positive consequence Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       6to living authentically. These findings were echoed in a recent qualita-tive study with TNB youth across the gender spectrum, where partic-ipants described a range of positive as well as more challenging emo-tions (Budge et al., 2021). In that study, the most frequently discussed positive emotion that participants reflected on was labeled happiness, with Budge et al. (2021) noting that this activated emotion occurred in response to numerous situations where TNB identity was central and salient for participants, such as experiences related to coming out, be-ing correctly gendered, and becoming more engaged and knowledge-able about activism to promote transgender rights. Where research on happiness specifically is more limited within the broader literature on TNB well-being, a more robust body of lit-erature has focused on various aspects of positive and affirming iden-tity development and processes among TNB people with important implications for understanding and conceptualizing subjective well-being and the ways in which these processes are critical to TNB men-tal health. Research in this area has tended to focus more specifically on the range of emotions TNB people experience (Budge et al., 2015, 2021), how TNB people positively view their identity (Austin, 2016; Riggle et al., 2011), and how emotions and identity in turn relate to well-being (e.g., Austin, 2016; Budge et al., 2015, 2021; Clements et al., 2021; Goffnett et al., 2022). In addition to the emotions surrounding TNB identity, research has also explored different roles and functions of TNB identity as it relates to mental health, which has in turn revealed varying ways for under-standing the intersection of positive and affirming TNB identity with well-being. For example, at times, positive TNB identity has been sit-uated in research design as a resilience factor in mitigating adverse health outcomes, while at other times, it has been positioned as the outcome of interest itself. For example, in a qualitative study with TNB individuals exploring suicide protective factors, participants de-scribed transition-related processes and experiences, identity devel-opment and acceptance, and meaningful support from others partic-ularly as it related to gender identity affirmation, as being essential to protecting against either considering or attempting suicide and to-ward promoting well-being (Moody & Smith, 2013). Another study used an innovative qualitative approach where TNB youth were asked what advice they would offer their peers; results demonstrated that Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       7although participants noted the challenges associated with being TNB, participants centered their advice around focusing on aspects of view-ing one’s identity in positive ways and experiencing connection (Goff-nett & Paceley, 2020). Specifically, participants stated the importance of encouraging others to find the positive aspects of being trans, hav-ing pride and self-assurance in one’s gender, being authentic, trust-ing the process, and recognizing that one is not alone. These findings echo other scholarship on trans identity development, where devel-opmental processes often involve moving from uncertainty to know-ing and from shame and confusion to pride and self-acceptance (Aus-tin, 2016; Devor, 2004); notably, these studies also hold as integral the role of being seen by others for who one is (a concept referred to as “witnessing”) and seeing oneself in similar others (“mirroring”; Austin, 2016; Devor, 2004). Present Study This study aims to build on the extant literature with two overarch-ing research questions that center the conceptualization of happiness. Adopting a social constructivist approach to exploring happiness as a subjective experience, in our development of interview questions and in the subsequent data coding process, we drew from the prior liter-ature to adopt a broad definition of happiness, aiming to capture ex-periences ranging from momentary and discrete affect to a more dif-fuse internal experience (e.g., Budge et al., 2015). With no research to date specifically focusing on happiness in TNB people, we are in-terested in how TNB individuals experienced happiness generally as well as specifically in relation to their gender. As TNB people experi-ence numerous societal barriers to optimal health and functioning as a result of systemic prejudice and bias, we also focused on what TNB individuals identified as factors that promoted or detracted from hap-piness in their lives. Therefore, this study sought to answer the fol-lowing research questions: Research Question 1: How do TNB adults describe and experience happiness? Research Question 2: What fosters or impedes happiness? Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       8Method Participants Participants in the present study were 20 trans and/or nonbinary adults who lived in the communities local to the university at which this study was conducted. Participants’ ages ranged from 20 to 72 (M = 33.35, SD = 12.97). Participants reported their gender identity by writing an open response to the question “What is your current gen-der identity?” Participants used a variety of terms to describe their gender, and many used more than one term. Participants self-reported their sexual identity by writing an open response and reported race by selecting from a list as many options as were applicable to them. Full sample demographics are reported in Table 1. Study Materials and Procedures Approval for this study was provided by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at a large Midwestern university. Following Levitt et al. (2018) guidelines for reporting qualitative research, we outline our study pro-cedures and process. This study was not preregistered. The research team posted flyers in queer and transfriendly businesses and gather-ing places in local community businesses and organizations and sent recruitment invitation emails via listservs. To be eligible for inclusion in the study, participants were required to be the age of majority, and to be or have identified with a trans or nonbinary identity for at least 1 year. This last criterion was included because we were interested in capturing participants’ retrospective reflections on happiness experi-enced while a TNB person. After contacting a member of the research team, interviews were scheduled at the time and place of the partici-pant’s convenience and what was most accessible for them (e.g., pri-vate university office, a private room in a local public library). After completing the informed consent process and the demo-graphic questionnaire, which included questions related to race, gen-der, pronouns, age, income, employment, education, and relationship status, the audio-taped interview began with two brief introductory questions to help the participant become comfortable with the inter-viewer and the interview format, and to help prime the participant to Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       9Table 1 Participant Demographics (N = 20)Demographic measure nAge: M = 33.35, SD = 12.97 Sexual orientation Queer  5 Straight  4 Pansexual  2 Bisexual  2 Lesbian  2 Demi-sexual lesbian  1 Somewhat femme leaning  1 Gay  1 Middle of spectrum  1 Asexual panromantic  1Race and ethnicity White  17 American Indian or Alaska Native and Hispanic or Latinx  2 Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and White  1Income $0_19,999  7 $20,000_29,999  4 $30,001_49,999  7 $50,000_90,000  2Employment Full-time  10 Full-time, student  3 Self-employed, contract worker  3 Part-time  2 Part-time, student  1 Other  1Gender identity Male  3\t Genderfluid\t\t 2 Nonbinary  2 Both female and male  1 Female  1\t Genderfluid\tfemale\t\t 1 Male (Two-Spirit)  1\t Nonbinary/gender-fluid\t\t 1 Nonbinary woman  1 Nonbinary/Two-Spirit  1 Nonbinary presenting female  1 Transmasculine  1 Transgender/genderqueer  1 Transmasculine/nonbinary  1\t Transgender,\tspecifically\tnonbinary\t\t 1 Queer  1Education Some college  8 College degree  7 Professional degree  3 Trade/vocational school  2Relationship status Dating long term  4 Married (legally recognized)  4 Partnered, in a committed relationship, or married               (not legally recognized)  4 Single  4 Polyamorous or open  3 Other  1Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       10consider their TNB identity. Participants were then asked to reflect on nine main questions relating to happiness (the interview protocol is available in online supplemental materials). All interviews were au-dio-recorded and transcribed for further analysis. The length of in-terviews ranged from 17 min to 93 min, with an average length of 43 min across participants. Participants were compensated in $50 cash for their time and participation. Constructivist Grounded Theory Analysis We used constructivist grounded theory (CGT; Charmaz, 2014) to an-alyze the qualitative data collected in this study. As a methodology of qualitative inquiry, CGT places at the center a focus on how partici-pants construct meaning related to the topic at hand (Chun Tie et al., 2019). Through inductive analysis, conceptual frameworks or theo-ries are developed and constructed. The analytic process in CGT in-volves three sequential steps: initial, focused, and theoretical coding. To prepare the data for analysis, transcriptions for each audio record-ing were created by members of the research team using transcrip-tion software and equipment (i.e., transcription foot pedal). Identify-ing information (e.g., names, specific locations) were removed at this step to protect participants’ privacy and confidentiality, and pseud-onyms were assigned to each participant. Before beginning data analysis, members of the research team met as a group to discuss our positionalities as individual team members and as a group in this study, and to identify our biases and expec-tations for what this study might reveal. Demographically, all team members were White with varying genders and sexual orientations. The first author, a White queer trans man and faculty member at a large Midwestern public university, had prior experience conducting and analyzing qualitative research with TNB populations. The remain-ing team members were students at the time of the study and had not previously had experience conducting qualitative research with TNB individuals or communities. Throughout the analytic process, we met weekly as a research team to discuss the data analysis, clarify decision-making, and ensure con-sistency in the process. During these meetings, we also engaged in conversations about how our positionalities shaped our perspectives Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       11and biases in analysis and interpretation of study findings. For exam-ple, team members named when they wondered if they were overi-dentifying with participant data or when findings emerged that team members found surprising or unexpected, and together we explored how our positionalities informed our relationships to the data. There-fore, when these dynamics emerged for team members, we engaged in discussion as a larger group to come to consensus on how to address questions related to the analysis and interpretation of data. Interview transcripts were divided between two pairs. In the first step of initial coding, line-byline codes were generated from the data using gerunds to capture the constructed meaning of participants’ re-sponses to the interview questions. For each transcript, both mem-bers generated line-byline codes independently, then met together to discuss and reach consensus on final line-byline codes. In the second step (focused coding), line-byline codes were placed into conceptual categories to begin to organize data across participants, following the same procedures as in the first step, with each member of the coding pair first assigning categories independently, then coming together to compare and reach consensus. Following Charmaz’s (2014) described iterative process, as data analysis progressed in the focused coding stage through the initial codes for each transcript, categories were iteratively added, changed, or removed with line-byline codes being moved as needed to increase conceptual clarity in the coding process. As needed, additional higher order categories (subthemes, themes) were generated to further organize existing categories. In the final step, theoretical coding, focused codes were further organized con-ceptually through the development of a theoretical model that delin-eated the processes and relationships among constructed categories and themes. Each member of the research team generated their own individual theoretical model before meeting together as a large group to discuss and arrive at the final theoretical model, which is presented in the results section below.  Results We identified seven overarching themes from the data, each with be-tween six and 34 categories and between zero and nine subthemes Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       12(see Table 2). Four themes comprised core components of happiness: Authenticity (three subthemes, 13 categories), Connection with Oth-ers (five subthemes, 30 categories), Perspective Shift (six categories), and Agency (two subthemes, seven categories). We identified two ad-ditional themes related to factors that promoted happiness, Fuelers of Happiness (five subthemes, 29 categories), and those that lessened happiness, Detractors of Happiness (nine subthemes, 34 categories). Each is described below with illustrative quotations. Participants’ de-mographics (age, race/ ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation iden-tity) are listed after their pseudonym in the first appearance. Core Component: Authenticity Authenticity, or the ability to be oneself in the world, was described by our participants as a powerful core component of happiness. Par-ticipants described a general need for authenticity, as well as a need for authenticity specifically as it related to their gender and in their relationships with others. This core component comprised three sub-themes and 13 categories. General Authenticity Included in this subtheme were the categories self-awareness, self-acceptance, personal growth, and authenticity leading to a sense of freeness. We coded excerpts under this subtheme when participants described experiences that related generally to feeling authentic con-nection to self; at times, though not always, participants connected these more general experiences to their gender specifically. When this occurred, these general descriptions were double-coded with the subtheme of authenticity related to gender. For many participants in our study, exploring and coming to know oneself, or labeled here as self-awareness, led to self-acceptance, or the experience of being com-fortable and accepting of self. For example, one participant, Charlie (34, White, nonbinary, queer), explained to the interviewer how their self-awareness has grown over time, “I feel like I know myself pretty darn well and that’s very helpful. Even the parts of myself I may not love.” In turn, being able to be oneself contributed to a sense of free-ness, which was in turn tied to happiness, “Being unencumbered and Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       13Table 2 Summary of Study Themes, Subthemes, and CategoriesCore component: Authenticity General authenticity  Self-awareness  Self-acceptance  Personal growth  Authenticity leading to a sense of freeness Authenticity related to gender  Understanding and acceptance of self as trans  Trans authenticity in expression and body fosters happiness  Trans authenticity fosters pride Authenticity in relation to others  Being authentic regardless of what others thought  Authenticity to show common humanity  Pride in others living authentically  Authenticity fostered connection with othersCore component: Connection with others Community connections  Community participation fosters happiness  Ease of connecting with other queer and trans people  Connecting with others who share similar values  Positive experiences with trans and queer groups  Support from online communities  Gender transition fosters happiness Social belonging  Realizing that they are not alone in their gender  Social belonging fostered happiness Social support in coming out  Experiences of support within relationships  Other people having to accept their gender Importance of support  Support fosters general happiness\t \t Support\tspecific\tto\tgender\tfosters\thappiness  Other sources of nondyadic support  Support fosters authenticityCore component: Perspective shift\t Challenging\tcultural\tdefinitions\tof\tgender  Seeing gender as a social construct  Expanding conceptualizations of gender\t \t Finding\thappiness\tthrough\tnot\tfitting\tinto\tsocietal\tgender\tstandards Perspective shifts leading to empathy and advocacy Advocacy fosters happinessCore component: Agency Perceived agency generally Agency and autonomy in gender transition Intentionality as agency  Being intentional in fostering happiness  Happiness as a choice Mindfulness as agency  Mindful connection in one’s body  Happiness through mindful presence Additional component: Fuelers to happiness Self-care Healthy relationships Meaning in life Hope WorkAdditional component: Detractors of happiness Antitrans stigma Barriers to transitioning Negative relationships and interpersonal experiences Life stressors Psychological distressBolded text indicates main themes, plain text indicates subthemes, and italicized text indicates categories.Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       14allowed to pursue life and be myself is where that happiness comes from” (Morgan, 33, White, nonbinary woman, demisexual lesbian). Personal growth, described by participants as persistence through challenges, also corresponded with participants’ experiences of au-thenticity. Participants described how the work of personal growth brought them contentment, a sense of accomplishment, and a greater sense of pride in who they are. For example, Morgan described how being “able to connect to things and grow, and engage the world as I want to, that allows me to improve and address those goals and have a sense of improvement.” Ethan (52, Indigenous and Latinx, male [Two-Spirit], queer) connected his experience in the work he was doing for recovery as necessary for him to be able to experience happiness: One of the things in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, they talk about trudging the road to happy destiny. It’s work sometimes to get there, like trudging through something, but getting through it actually gets you there. Like they used to say, the only way out is through … if you’re not willing to do the work of trudging, then you’re not going to get to the happiness.  Authenticity Related to Gender  We identified a number of categories that were included in this sub-theme, which captured how participants described the connection of happiness to authenticity that specifically and explicitly related to their gender: Understanding and acceptance of self as trans, trans au-thenticity in expression and body fosters happiness, trans authentic-ity fosters pride. With gender at the center of their reflection in these categories, participants described how authentically knowing and ex-pressing their gender was vital to well-being as a TNB person. Re-garding understanding and acceptance of self as trans, participants described the self-understanding and happiness that followed from learning about noncisgender identities and others like themselves. Of particular importance in this category was the power of language in helping to shape and understand shared experience. For example, Avery (37, White, Asian, and Indigenous, queer, queer) stated of their nonbinary identity, “this is an identity that encompasses who I am, Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       15like I can locate myself in the spectrum in a more accurate way than I could before.” Reflecting on his trans identity, Leo (22, White, male, straight) explained how self-determination leads to happiness: I am happy that I know that this is how I identify. ‘Cause that’s a lot better than feeling terrible and not knowing. So, having the knowledge and freedom to be able to identify this way, that makes me really happy. Trans authenticity in expression and body fosters happiness cap-tured participants’ descriptions of how accessing the ability to express gender in a manner that felt authentic and congruent fostered happi-ness. James (34, White, male, straight) succinctly stated, “When I look in the mirror, and see me for who I am, that makes me happy.” Sim-ilarly, Sophia (25, White, female, straight) described the joy she ex-perienced when holding her hormone prescription for the first time. After I got home, I just remember opening up the bottles and staring at the two pills for a while, just [feeling] so happy. ’Oh my god, like, I finally have this now.’ After I think it was a year in therapy, I finally got it and … It can’t be taken away from me now. With an increased sense of congruence in gender identity and ex-pression, participants identified a deeper resonance with and connec-tion to their body. For example, Ethan said, “So it’s only been a few years that I’ve been out as transgender, but I finally feel as though I’m completely in my body.” Similarly, Leo described how he felt af-ter top surgery, “I felt like myself. Which was really weird and some-thing that I’d never felt before … For the first time I felt like I was actually who I was supposed to be, you know?” This feeling of con-nection in turn opened the door for participants to experience happi-ness in a different way: I’ve recognized that I can be really happy when I’m feel-ing that sense of contentedness in my body … these things for me, running, climbing, biking have all taken on different meanings for me over time in my transition … so, when I’m Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       16feeling most connected to my body and at peace with it is of-ten when those feelings of joy and elation come. (Oliver, 25, White, transgender/genderqueer, queer) For many participants, trans authenticity fostered pride and connec-tion to the larger trans community. Corey (23, White, nonbinary, les-bian) described, “So being able to accept that I’m a part of [the trans] community and be okay with that. And feel proud of it, especially right now.” Others also felt a sense of pride in representing the community, especially for those who could be struggling with their identity and finding acceptance from others. Jude (23, White, nonbinary present-ing female, lesbian) discussed being visible at work to help other trans people feel comfortable, especially trans kids. Just knowing that I’m a part of a bigger community of peo-ple … Knowing that I can help further the trans cause … that’s a big part of it. It’s important that other people like me feel comfortable. Like I didn’t when I was a kid. You know? I want people to be able to figure out they’re trans as soon as possible. Authenticity in Relation to Others Finally, participants related the importance of authenticity in their re-lationships with other people as integral to their well-being. Within this subtheme, we extracted several categories: being authentic regard-less of what others thought, authenticity to show common humanity, pride in others living authentically, and authenticity fostered connec-tion with others. Many participants described being authentic regard-less of what others thought and living true to themselves despite oth-ers’ judgements. Ethan described the pressure he experienced early on to appease societal norms of “passing” and his process of under-standing what it meant to live authentically both within himself and in relation to others: I don’t feel like I pass today, cause I don’t know if I’ll ever pass as a, truly a man. And I don’t know if I ever want to. I know that I’m a man, I don’t have to convince you of it just Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       17by the way I dress and act. And, I still always want to push people to think outside of the boxes… . But for me, happi-ness isn’t even about getting anything or going anywhere. It’s just this feeling that you have in your heart. It’s loving yourself for you. Some participants used authenticity to show common humanity, de-scribing their strength in the vulnerability they experienced sharing their authentic selves with others, and how this vulnerability in turn helped build connections with others. For example, Sam described in-tentionality in being vulnerable and open to sharing their struggles to show others that making mistakes is core to being a person. I’m also an alcoholic in recovery and have dealt with a lot of emotional and psychological issues. This is about me being authentic and honest with people about who I am. I try to be honest about all of my struggles. I try to be an open book even through my work in public policy. I just want people to know that they don’t have to hide who they are. We all have struggles as humans. Additionally, some participants felt a sense of pride in helping oth-ers live authentically. Participants described feeling fulfilled when helping other people connect with their authentic selves. Avery de-scribed enjoying helping others connect with themselves and finding liberation from the societal confines of gender. I like helping other people feel comfortable about their iden-tity too. I think when people talk to me, they get a better sense that they don’t have to be stuck in a box or have to be somebody else or sacrifice things about their identity to be trans or genderqueer. Finally, authenticity fostered connection with others. Participants described how living true to themselves in turn led to a sense of open-ness and connection with other people. For example, Ethan said, “[If] I’m telling you really who I am, and being fully self-expressed, more than likely you’re going to be drawn to that, and not repelled away from it. Because deep down inside that’s what we all want.” Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       18Core Component: Connection With Others Another core component of happiness that emerged in the data was connection with others. The ability to be authentic with oneself and with others further fueled participants’ connection with others, which in this study captured participants’ sense of belonging, support from others, and relationships with other people and with communities. This core component comprised six subthemes and 30 categories, which are described below. Community Connections Participants described diverse experiences of connections with com-munity groups. Categories captured within this subtheme were com-munity participation fosters happiness, ease of connecting with other queer and trans people, connecting with others who share similar val-ues, positive experiences with trans/queer groups, support from on-line communities, and gender transition fosters connection with others. When noting that community participation fosters happiness, partic-ipants described the different types of communities they were con-nected to and the general benefits they brought, such as helping to co-ordinate and serve meals in large communal groups or joining LGBT groups and religious communities. For example, Jordan described con-necting with a religious congregation that welcomed LGBT commu-nity members, “A couple weeks ago I joined the church and it’s been a wonderful positive experience, just a lot of really great things. I have a community for the first time in my life.” In addition to the ties many participants made between being part of communities generally, many participants also described how the ease of connecting with other queer and trans people is an important aspect of well-being. For example, Quinn (23, White, transgender spe-cifically nonbinary/gender fluid, pansexual) described: I feel a lot more comfortable in certain spaces when I am al-lowed to be my trans identity … I can go places with my other LGBT friends. And I feel valid there. So that’s one aspect of my trans identity that makes me super happy, is I feel closer to the people who I want to be close with. Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       19Although many participants tied shared identity to ease of connec-tion with others, some participants described the importance of con-necting with others who shared similar values beyond shared iden-tity. For example, Liam (28, White, transmasculine, queer) reflected: The only people that I was hanging out with were young queer and trans and gay people. But we had nothing in com-mon. [laughs] … we don’t wanna just be hanging out with people because we have that one thing in common. We need people who are thinking about their other ethics and identi-ties and these other things. With in-person support at times being limited, participants re-ported seeking out support from online communities. Jude described filtering out negativity on a social media site to find support from oth-ers who were going through similar challenges when they described seeing, “people asking questions and saying, ‘Am I valid? Is this nor-mal?’ And it’s good to see that in other people other than just me, ‘cause I know that they’re going through the same thing.” Finally, many participants described how their gender transitions fostered connection with others. Specifically, many participants de-scribed how transitioning led to opportunities to strengthen or create new, meaningful relationships with other people. Noting his apprehen-sion about how his transition might impact his relationships, James re-ported, “It was scary. Really, really scary. I thought I was gonna lose a lot of friends and family. But, in reality I gained more friends. My fam-ily got closer to me.” Alex (21, White, transmasculine/nonbinary, bi-sexual) also described how their trans identity allowed them to make meaningful connections with other trans people: I like that [my trans identity] is something that connects you to other people from all walks of life, you know. Like getting together with other trans people and being able to talk about the similarities and the differences and being able to vent, I guess, having that community means a lot. Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       20Social Belonging Within this subtheme, participants described categories of realizing that they are not alone in their gender and social belonging fosters hap-piness. Many participants described a process of building social be-longing and connections with others where they once felt alone and misunderstood, then realizing that they were not alone in their gen-der. Participants described meeting others like themselves as core to this realization. For example, Quinn described,   I guess it took going to college and realizing that there were people like me at college and that I was not alone and that it wasn’t just a thing that I felt invalidated about. It was a thing that everybody kind of experienced at least once about gender identity. Overall, social belonging fostered happiness for participants. Many participants described how feeling needed or wanted by other peo-ple contributed to their happiness. Sophia described enjoying feeling included with her friends, “It makes me happy when my friends text me, like, ‘Hey Sophia, like, you should come here, we’re doing this you should come.’ And just knowing that I’m being thought of and included.” Social Support in Coming Out We identified two distinct categories in this subtheme: experiences of support within relationships and other people having to accept their gender. Consistent with prior literature, participants described expe-riences of support within their relationships with friends, family, and partners as being crucial to happiness—or when support was lacking, most negatively impactful to their happiness. When important others were unsupportive, many participants described being persistent in expressing their gender in ways that were authentic as a way of hold-ing an important boundary in their relationship: you can choose to ac-cept me or not, but I will continue to be who I am. For example, Corey described how they had initially been rejected by their father for be-ing trans, but by persistently being themselves in their gender expres-sion, Corey’s father eventually began to support them in some ways: Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       21We were hanging out in Old Navy. And my brother and I were buying new pants in the same section. And by this point, I had also decided I didn’t really, it’s terrible, but I didn’t re-ally care what they thought. I was going to do what I was going to do.… And I think he’s had to come around to it, be-cause, again, he was there helping me find [pants] size, you know? [laughs] Importance of Support Within this subtheme, we extracted the categories of support fosters general happiness, support specific to gender fosters happiness, other sources of nondyadic support, and support fosters authenticity. Many participants emphasized how support fosters general happiness. For example, Leo stated, “Being around people that I love, being around people that support me, being around people that I care about—that’s a huge thing for me.” Many participants noted how support that was specific to their gender was particularly impactful. This type of sup-port was described by many participants as the experience of being seen and accepted by others, which in turn contributed to a sense of belonging and happiness. Leo elaborated, “Specifically in terms of my [gender] identity, when people are super validating of that, that makes me feel awesome.” When James was asked about his happiest moment in life, James shared the following story: I think one of the happiest moments for me, when I came out to my kids. I separated them, and did it alone with them, to tell them what was going on and explained everything. I said, ‘You can start calling me dad whenever you feel comfortable doing that.’ So, for probably two weeks, my son, he’s gonna be 13, so he would have been, 11 and half, 12, when I came out to him. He came up with the word ‘momdad,’ at first. And then, probably two weeks after that, they just started calling me dad. I think them calling me dad for the first time was one of the happiest moments for me.… My daughter, when she started school she, had to write about cool facts about her. And she had wrote, on one of the facts, ‘my dad is trans-gender.’… Yeah, definitely the happiest moment is the kids embracing who I am. Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       22Participants described other sources of nondyadic support in their lives, which included support resources and structures related to their communities, work environments, and cultural heritage. Sam, who is gender-fluid, described drawing on their Native American heritage and cultural conceptions of gender as a vital aspect of support: My Native American heritage, which I don’t really know a lot about, talks about two-souled or different concepts. And just to know that while some social groups and people groups may not understand it, they may not ever try to understand it, there are those who do and have since time immemorial. Furthermore, participants described how receiving support fostered authenticity. Participants detailed that feeling connected and sup-ported from other people allowed them to explore and express their authentic selves. For example, Quinn described the nonjudgmental and safe environment of their campus LGBTQA resource center as es-sential to their growth: I got more involved on campus with [campus LGBTQA re-source centers]. As I got more involved there, volunteering and being a club member, I think it became easier. They have a very strict “no outing” policy. So I felt very safe there. I felt like I could go there and just talk about this kinda stuff with-out being judged. So through them, I think I became more comfortable with myself and then now, four years later, I feel much better with my [gender] identity. Morgan also described how being “meaningfully supported” and ac-cepted by others allowed them to be vulnerable in authentically ex-pressing who they are. After a little bit of that I was like, ‘Oh, okay, you know, I can open up a bit,’ so I just started being more expressive and less closed down. And wearing what I wanted to wear and more authentically expressing my interests and who I am. Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       23Core Component: Perspective Shift Although fewer codes were generated for Perspective Shift than the other core components of Authenticity, Connection to Others, and Agency, this theme represented a critical core component of happi-ness for participants. Perspective Shift comprised three subthemes and three categories. As a theme, Perspective Shift captured unique ways participants experienced shifts in how they perceived and un-derstood gender and other social constructs. These perspective shifts were critical to creating happiness in their lives as a TNB person. Sub-themes included in this core component were challenging cultural con-ceptions of gender, perspective shifts leading to empathy and advocacy, and advocacy leads to happiness.   Challenging Cultural Definitions of Gender Integral to many participants’ gender identity development process was a shift in perspective regarding cultural conceptions of gender. Of-ten overlapping, categories included in this subtheme were seeing gen-der as a social construct, expanding conceptualizations of gender, and finding happiness through not fitting into societal gender standards. Data captured in this subtheme revealed how participants identified an important process of critically questioning, analyzing, and expand-ing upon dominant cultural definitions and conceptions, reflecting a shift to seeing gender as a social construct. In this process, participants expressed expanding conceptualizations of gender and noted how they were able to better understand and communicate about their gender. For example, Oliver stated: One thing isn’t inherently male and another thing isn’t inher-ently female. That they can be both/and. I don’t necessarily believe in a spectrum. I believe in a giant bubble [laughs] or like, you know, plant roots that are all existing at the same time. In addition to participants wrestling with and shifting in their ex-panding conceptualizations of gender, some participants also iden-tified a similar process within themselves as it related to their own Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       24gender. For example, Alex described searching their memories for some defining indicators of their gender in their childhood, finding that this process challenged their internalized notions of what gen-der is and how it appeared for them in their life: … it’s not my mannerisms, it’s not the way I dress, it’s not the way I act, that makes me a guy, you know … so that’s not the defining factor, there’s some sort of innate thing. Many participants also identified how important it was to their happiness to critically question strict societal definitions of gender and sexual orientation and to identify their roots in cis- and hetero-normativity. Critiquing social definitions of gender and sexuality al-lowed participants an opportunity to self-define their gender and to grow their autonomy in a world that often restricts the authentic ex-pression of nondominant genders and sexualities. Morgan described how the language of “identity” can be used to delegitimize nondom-inant genders: I think it’s interesting the way people conceptualize ‘identity,’ and people consider their identity natural. But people who are different are not natural… . So in some way, people con-sider ‘identity’ constructed or artificial, which is definitely to me a very strange theory of mind thing, because they would never think of themselves that way. Perspective Shifts Leading to Empathy and Advocacy Participants also discussed how a deeper understanding of gender and other aspects of social identity created greater capacity for empathy for others. Along with this empathy, some participants noted, came a commitment to advocate for other marginalized people and groups. Charlie’s own experiences of being marginalized led them to be more thoughtful in their understanding of what others experience: I think this dovetails with my gender identity in terms of sex-uality as well, but there’s no way to prove it but I’d like to think that I’m a more empathic person because of it… . And Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       25because of that, I like to think that I’m more thoughtful, in my interactions with other people… . in trying to consider where other people might be coming from. Liam also discussed having more empathy for others who have been marginalized and the importance of advocacy when he said, “I can see how other groups who are also in the minority, I can relate in some ways and sort of advocate based on my experiences.” Advocacy Fosters Happiness Advocacy, although challenging, fostered meaning in life and happi-ness for participants. Ethan stated, “Advocacy, although it can be diffi-cult, also makes me happy.” Corey felt energized by community advo-cacy and described how “[Activism] fuels you, make you really sense your community. I mean, the Women’s March here in [local town] was energizing.” Mia (25, White, woman, “somewhat femme leaning”) de-scribed gaining meaning from the advocacy work that she does: I’m doing fundraising for political causes and progressive causes and things like that. And while I might not be the one out there actually changing minds, I’m allowing the work to happen. And, that’s a nice feeling, I want to have some sort of purpose for the work that I do. Core Component: Agency Finally, the last core component that emerged from the data was agency, or the ability to have autonomous control over one’s mental, emotional, and physical well-being, and individual decisions and ac-tions without infringement or restriction from others. Participants further described how a lack of agency was a detriment to their hap-piness, while having agency fostered happiness. Although participants noted the importance of agency generally, participants also noted that agency and autonomy related to gender transition was of specific and essential importance to well-being. This core component comprised four subthemes and four categories. Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       26Perceived Agency Generally Codes included in this subtheme captured participants’ reflections of how critically important agency, as perceived generally, was to their happiness. Notably, this was true in both directions. That is, partici-pants tied having greater perceived agency to happiness and also de-scribed how limited or restricted agency was significantly detrimen-tal to their happiness. For example, Jordan emphasized, “[Happiness] feels like freedom. It feels like choice… . If I am trapped or cornered or my physical or situational choices are limited then to that extent, I am not happy.” Charlie added having resources as vital to agency when they said, “I think of happiness as being seen for who you are and for being able to speak and have people listen to you. Having ac-cess to resources and having choice.” Agency and Autonomy in Gender Transition In addition to agency generally, participants also described how im-portant perceived agency specific to their gender was to their happi-ness. Many participants noted how gender transition allowed them to have more agency in their lives and to be happy. At the same time, par-ticipants described it as vital to their happiness to not be restricted in their gender transition by following a prescribed path—for example, one determined by medical professionals—and instead feel and main-tain control of their transition process. As one example of this, Oliver described their positive experiences with a health care setting which used the informed consent model to transition- related services. Oli-ver walked through the steps that were taken at the clinic, which in-cluded initial lab work, a conversation with the health provider about what support they needed as they started hormones, and a demonstra-tion of how to administer the hormones. Oliver noted their response to their experience, “So it’s very simple. It’s just allowing people, like, ‘I’ve made this decision for myself. Here is what I need.’” Intentionality as Agency Participants described two categories within this subtheme: being in-tentional in fostering happiness and viewing happiness as a choice to Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       27make for themselves. Participants described being intentional in fos-tering happiness in their daily lives by doing activities that made them happy and cared for themselves. Jude described how they actively fos-ter their happiness, “I try to do something, like play a video game or go out to a restaurant I like or something that makes me happy ev-ery day.” Ethan also described self-care activities, “I love taking care of myself. Like, take a shower and fix up my hair, and putting on a shirt and tie, and just taking that time to be good to myself makes me happy.” Some participants described happiness as a choice that they make despite the stressors that they face in daily life. These partici-pants emphasized the importance of actively building their own well-being despite the social and environmental structures trying to de-stroy and prevent their happiness. Thomas (60, White, male, straight) described the importance of choosing to be happy, no matter the life circumstances he is in. I will be this person until I die. No matter what. You know what I mean? … . I can choose to be like, ‘oh I’m gonna die [pause] soon.’ You know? I mean, that shit happens to every-body. It’s not like I’m special. You know, in that way, it’s like well, so if I choose to live the way I am now and be happy and love my life or I could be miserable and then die when I’m 90 and just have wasted all that time being miserable. It just doesn’t make any sense to me. Mindfulness as Agency Many participants experienced a greater sense of agency through mindfulness, which in turn increased their happiness. Two categories emerged in this subtheme: mindful connection in one’s body and hap-piness through mindful presence. Many participants described mind-fulness as an activity they engaged in intentionally to foster wellbe-ing. Of particular importance to some participants’ happiness was a mindful connection in their body or physical selves. For instance, Av-ery described, “So, I like physical activities that are challenging and hard and just to keep my brain like really engaged. So, stuff keeps me 100% in the physical moment feels really good.” Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       28Participants also discussed experiencing happiness through mind-ful presence in the here and now. Quinn described, “Just kind of be-ing, rather than worrying. I guess that’s comfort for me…. Being in-side of my body as opposed to worrying about the people outside of my body.” Charlie connected being in the present rather than always thinking about the future as important to their happiness. I’ve realized that I joke a lot about, ‘Oh, well, it’s really the weekend when I get to take off my watch.’ Or it’s really, ‘I’m really on vacation when I don’t have to look at my phone.’ Not being aware of mechanical time, but living in body time… . That is very definitive for me. But being very present, not having to think about where I have to be, what I need to plan for, when’s something due, you know? Additional Component: Fuelers to Happiness In addition to the core components of happiness described above, par-ticipants described other aspects of their lives that also contributed to or fueled their well-being and happiness. Often these fuelers contrib-uted to happiness by increasing one or more core components. For ex-ample, participants described engaging in self-care activities that keep them happy and healthy (increasing Agency), developing healthy re-lationships with others (increasing Connection to Others, Authentic-ity), feeling a sense of meaning in life and hope (increasing Perspective Shift, Authenticity, and Agency), and their work experiences (increas-ing Agency, Authenticity, Connection to Others, and Perspective Shift) as all fuelers to their happiness. Some fuelers to happiness were iden-tified by participants as being specific to their gender and lived ex-periences as a TNB person, while many were identified as being es-sential to wellbeing of their whole selves. A robust theme, fuelers to happiness comprised five subthemes and 29 categories. Notably, most if not all fuelers described by participants are well-documented in the broader literature as important contributors to happiness across pop-ulations. As such, these themes are presented in online supplemen-tal materials. Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       29Additional Component: Detractors From Happiness While there were numerous factors that helped fuel happiness, many participants described several aspects of their lives that detracted, or served as barriers, to their happiness and well-being. In parallel fash-ion to the fuelers described above, the detractors that participants identified acted to decrease well-being, often times by diminishing one or more core components. For example, structural and interpersonal forms of antitrans stigma (decreasing Agency, Authenticity, and Con-nection to Others), barriers to transitioning (decreasing Agency, Au-thenticity, and Connection to Others), negative relationships and inter-personal experiences (decreasing Connection to Others, Authenticity, and Agency), and life stressors and psychological distress (decreasing Agency, Connection to Others, and Perspective Shift) significantly de-tracted from happiness for many participants. This theme was simi-larly large, comprising five subthemes and 33 categories. Similar to the fuelers described above, the detractors that participants identified in this study are robustly documented in the previous literature, and as such are presented in online supplemental materials.   A Model of Happiness for TNB Individuals In the final stage of coding, we generated a visual model from our data that depicts the relationships among the emergent themes (see Figure 1). Interrelated and at times overlapping, centered in the model are the four core components of Authenticity, Connection with Others, Perspective Shift, and Agency, which comprised critical as-pects of well-being for TNB individuals in our study. Although dis-tinct conceptually, these components often operated in concert with each other; as capacity in one core area of wellbeing increased, so too did capacity in others. For example, some participants described how having agency in their gender transition increased their abil-ity to live, be, and express themselves in an authentic manner. This authenticity in turn increased participants’ capacity to connect to others and to also see and understand their own gender against the backdrop of societal constructions of gender. In connecting with others and receiving support, participants were able to experience Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       30vulnerability in being present with and in expressing their authentic selves. In turn, participants identified having greater cognitive ca-pacity to explicitly challenge societal constraints of gender. Depicted on the left in the model, numerous external factors fueled core as-pects of wellbeing for participants. Similarly, when participants en-countered barriers to happiness and other detractors to their well-being, one or more core components were constrained to negative effect on individuals’ well-being. Figure 1 A Model of Happiness in TNB Adults (TNB = trans and nonbinary)Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       31Discussion We identified a number of distinct themes from the present study’s data that comprised core aspects of happiness among TNB partic-ipants: Authenticity, Connection to Others, Perspective Shift, and Agency. Each theme was composed of subthemes and categories. Connections among the core themes also existed, such that as hap-piness in one area grew or diminished, other aspects were also de-scribed as being similarly affected. Participants noted how external factors often helped to fuel or detract from these different aspects of happiness. However, participants also described internally derived processes (e.g., happiness as a choice, being intentional in fostering happiness) that helped them seek out opportunities for further hap-piness. Together, data from the present study paint a clear picture of how TNB participants experienced happiness, what participants iden-tified as important to their happiness, and what types of factors con-tributed to or constrained happiness. Findings from the present study hold important implications for theoretical contribution to the larger bodies of literature on positive psychology and TNB mental health. First, results echo previous de-scriptions of happiness as discrete, fleeting moments, to happiness that exists at the deepest level of satisfaction in the form of derived meaning and in context of greater emotional complexity (Winston, 2016). When participants described what they believed happiness to be and how they experienced it, the themes that emerged from our analysis aligned with existing conceptualizations of authentic hap-piness (Seligman, 2002, 2012), which centers positive emotions, en-gagement, and positive relationships as core components of happi-ness, and PWB, which position authentic living as most important to realizing one’s full potential (Waterman, 1993; Westerhof & Keyes, 2010). Notably, the six domains of PWB—self-acceptance, autonomy, positive relations with others, environmental mastery, and personal growth (Ryff, 1989; Ryff & Keyes, 1995)—can all be found among the themes and subthemes that emerged in this study. Findings from the present study add rich detail to the specific ways in which those var-ious aspects appeared for our TNB participants and what they meant to each person. Although less emphasized in the initial articulation of PWB where well-being domains are largely described as internally Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       32derived, results from this study also make clear how critically impor-tant social relationships and dynamics were to TNB individuals’ expe-riences of happiness, and in fact, position the social and psychologi-cal as inextricably connected. In considering the dynamics among the themes that emerged in this study, results bore a marked resemblance to the three core psy-chological needs and their function articulated in the Basic Psycholog-ical Needs Theory (BPNT; Ryan & Deci, 2008, 2017; Vansteenkiste & Ryan, 2013; Vansteenkiste et al., 2020). That is, the satisfaction of the three core psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness, and compe-tence acts independently and directly to increase an individual’s psy-chological well-being. In much the same way, the core constructs iden-tified from data in the present study act independently and directly to affect the degree to which individuals experience happiness, and indeed, were described in various ways by participants as essential. The core theme in the present study that held the closest resem-blance to one of the three BPNT needs, relatedness, was connection to others. Participants described experiencing social belonging, connec-tion to community, and being connected to systems of support that were both general and specific to various aspects of identity as being essential to their well-being. In this study, the theme of Connection to Others captured the importance of individual relationships and so-cial support, as well as the importance of a larger sense of belonging and connection to community. This extends existing theory on BPNT and PWB to underscore the importance of conceptualizing and mea-suring social connection across levels, from interpersonal to commu-nity to societal domains. Future research could also explore the de-gree of interconnection in social connection among these domains and determine any differential effects on happiness and other aspects of well-being. This study’s main themes of Authenticity and Agency also resem-bled BPNT’s core needs of competence and autonomy, which are de-fined as a sense of self-efficacy with an internal perceived locus of causality (Ryan & Deci, 2000). According to BPNT, competence and au-tonomy are positioned as context or domain- specific and are behav-iorally operationalized. Similarly, in the present study, participants ex-pressed the importance of being able to be themselves across contexts and to have agency in everyday activities, particularly as it related to Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       33their gender. Authenticity and agency as important to meaningful re-lationships with others and in response to the external environment. Diverging from BPNT, however, participants also described authen-ticity and agency as a deeply internal process and experience. In this way, findings from the present study help strengthen the theoreti-cal bridge from PWB domains of self-acceptance, purpose in life, au-tonomy, environmental mastery, and personal growth to the theoret-ical tenets of BPNT to consider core needs not just between domains or contexts, but also in relation to social identity. This is particularly likely to be true for individuals who experience identity- based mar-ginalization where needs related to identity authenticity and agency are readily apparent in the face of stigma and social and economic bar-riers within societal institutions. Diverging from extant theories of happiness and well-being, this study identified an additional core component of Perspective Shift as being central to well-being. This component is unique among the oth-ers in two important ways. First, it is conceptually distinct from the other components identified in the present study and from PWB do-mains and the three core needs articulated by BPNT. Participants de-scribed shifts in perspective, or an emerging reorientation and under-standing of gender and themselves in society as critical to well-being. As such, Perspective Shift reflects internal and largely cognitive pro-cesses. As a result, the second way in which it is unique among other components is in its function and as a more stable contributor to participants’ well-being over time. For example, with Authenticity, Agency, and Connection to Others more likely to fluctuate affectively in response to internal and external cues, Shifts in Perspective are more likely to endure across contexts, reflecting a critical aspect of resil-ience and resistance in response to societal stigma. In many ways, although the emergence of Perspective Shift is novel in the central role it occupies in a model of well-being, within the larger literature on social identity, resilience, and resistance to mar-ginalization (see Robinson & Schmitz, 2021 for an excellent overview), Perspective Shift as an important contributor to well-being is not sur-prising. Indeed, Perspective Shift as described by participants in the present study resembles a form of critical consciousness, a process by which oppressed or marginalized individuals critically analyze social conditions and enact social change (Freire, 2018). Research on critical Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       34consciousness among marginalized populations has supported its im-portant function as a resistance strategy for mitigating the harmful effects of social stigma and oppression (Diemer et al., 2016; Heberle et al., 2020; Hope et al., 2020; Yip & Chan, 2021). Although concep-tually broader than critical consciousness, per se, research and schol-arship with queer and TNB communities has consistently found iden-tity-related processes to be critical to resisting systemic oppression, such as identity integration (Cerezo et al., 2020), resisting oppressive narratives, affirming one’s own gender, and maintaining authenticity (Paceley et al., 2021). In the present study, gains in Perspective Shift were described as relatively enduring. Placing this core aspect of happiness in the model alongside Authenticity, Agency, and Connection to Others may provide a foundation from which to promote and address fluctuations in the other core components. Future research could test these hypotheti-cal relations and functions, such as investigating the degree to which Perspective Shift may buffer the deleterious impact of external detrac-tors of well-being on Authenticity, Agency, and Connection to Others. Causal and temporal effects of changes in the four main components to explore opportunities for prevention and intervention strategies may be particularly fruitful for understanding how to promote well-being across time and context. This study also underscores important implications for its contri-bution to the larger literature on TNB mental health more generally. Specifically, findings from the present study build on existing work that has documented positive emotions and experiences among TNB communities related to TNB identity (Budge et al., 2015; Riggle et al., 2011), while adding a rich level of detail to how TNB individuals ex-perience positive mental health, in this case their subjective experi-ence and definition of happiness, and the factors that promoted as well as impeded it. Although none of our participants used the spe-cific term gender euphoria, which is defined as the feeling of joy and rightness in one’s gender and increased subjective well-being that comes from external, internal, and social gender affirmation experi-ences (Beischel et al., 2022; Bradford et al., 2021), related to their ex-perience, much of what participants described as happiness that in-tersected with being TNB was conceptually consistent with this term. Thus, echoing broader themes found in the extant literature related to Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       35the importance of authenticity and agency in one’s gender (e.g., Cle-ments et al., 2021), findings from the present study capture further detail on the impact these constructs have on positive mental health and well-being, and underscore the importance of continuing to fo-cus on positive mental health outcomes in research. Consistent with Westerhof and Keyes (2010), two continua model of mental illness (psychological distress) and mental health (positive mental health), when presented with the opportunity to discuss happiness, partici-pants did so in ways that clearly placed happiness alongside distress, rather than as one versus the other. Counseling Implications Study findings support the need for mental health practitioners to frame happiness and well-being as critical aspects of mental health, distinct from suffering, to be attended to in therapy. However, con-versations about happiness should supplement, rather than supplant, therapeutic work aimed at addressing internalized stigma, psycho-logical distress, and other mental health symptomatology. We argue that centering a happiness and well-being frame (as one of several frames that might be used by a therapist) has the potential to accom-plish unique therapeutic dynamics and outcomes. This is consistent with prior research that has found positive psychology interventions (PPIs) have been found to have small to medium effects on a host of mental health outcomes, including well-being, stress, depression, and anxiety (Carr et al., 2021; Sin & Lyubomirsky, 2009). First, at its most basic, it is affirming to its core by communicating that one is deserv-ing of happiness. Indeed, many of our participants shared with us out-side of the study interviews that no one had ever asked them about happiness, particularly as it related to being trans and/or nonbinary; that to be posed such a question with the opportunity to deeply con-sider what happiness meant to that individual was a profoundly heal-ing experience that some described after the interview. Relatedly, centering a well-being frame in work with clients has the potential to move the therapeutic goal posts beyond the allevia-tion of suffering to situate thriving and happiness as not only attain-able but also desirable and worthy of therapeutic work. This premise is at the core of recent scholarship that has called for overtly affirming Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       36approaches to therapy with TNB clients (Matsuno, 2019; Matsuno & Israel, 2018; Spencer et al., 2021). Similarly, recent research has doc-umented the beneficial impact microaffirmations and positive ap-proaches have had on TNB clients in therapy (Anzani et al., 2019; Matsuno, 2019; Matsuno & Israel, 2018). For a population whose inter-actions with psychologists have historically necessitated overt pathol-ogization of trans identity and experience via diagnostic assessment (i.e., being assigned a diagnosis of gender identity disorder [Diagnos-tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder–Fourth Edition-Text Re-vised, DSM–IV–TR] or Gender Dysphoria [DSM–5]) in accordance with the World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care (Coleman et al., 2022), working with clients toward explicit goals of well-being, happiness, and thriving can also help to shift the relationship of TNB community members with mental health professionals over time. Study findings also point to more specific strategies clinicians can adopt in their work with their TNB clients. First, clinicians can con-sider ways to help support clients in growing capacity for and in-creasing experiences of the core components described in this study: Authenticity, Connection to Others, Perspective Shift, and Agency. Cli-nicians can work with clients to identify instances, even momentary ones, where clients were able to experience meaningful connection with self and others, greater sense of control and agency, and deep-ening understanding of self and identity in larger societal context. Notably, this intervention can be readily adapted and integrated into a therapist’s existing theoretical approach. For example, a therapist who pulls heavily on emotion-focused therapy can work with clients to deepen their emotional experience of these moments, tying that back to other therapeutic goals the therapist and client might be address-ing. A therapist who works from a cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) approach can help the client to also identify thoughts and behaviors that follow from these positive instances and integrate them into cog-nitive restructuring and reframing techniques. An additional avenue that may be particularly helpful to integrate into therapists’ practice is mindfulness. Results from the present study echo the well-estab-lished literature on the benefits of mindfulness for cultivating well-being (e.g., Brown & Ryan, 2003; McClintock et al., 2019; Shapiro et al., 2008). As a result, clinicians can teach clients basic mindfulness Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       37skills, build mindfulness practices into the therapy hour, and help the client explore how engaging intentionally in mindfulness can contrib-ute to overall well-being and to happiness. In addition to the specific strategies that could be adapted to and integrated within a therapist’s individual therapeutic approach, recent research and scholarship have also synthesized a host of other PPIs that could be adapted to working with TNB clients to further elicit positive psychological growth and support. For example, a recent systematic review recommended inter-ventions targeting self-compassion, optimism, love, forgiveness, and spirituality as being potentially particularly fruitful to enhance well-being and reduce health disparities among queer and TNB communi-ties (Job & Williams, 2020). Finally, with results suggesting that shifts in perspective represent a more stable and enduring core component to well-being for TNB in-dividuals, clinicians can work with clients to deepen their understand-ing of their gender within the client’s various contexts. To start, clini-cians can help clients identify the various contexts in which they live and work and the ways culture intersects with each. Clinicians can then help clients to explore, unpack, and begin to challenge cultural conceptions of gender and to identify the impact those have had on the client over time and within the client’s various contexts. This ap-proach is consistent with the gender- affirmative life span approach articulated by Spencer et al. (2021), where developing gender literacy and moving beyond the binary are two central therapeutic goals for working with TNB children, adolescents, and adults. Over the course of therapy, clinicians can look for opportunities to check in with cli-ents about how shifting perspectives on gender deepen understand-ing and meaning for the client and the ways in which clients may be-gin to interact differently in various contexts and with others. Study Limitations and Conclusion Findings from the present study should be interpreted in light of the study’s limitations. First, as with all qualitative research, findings can-not be generalized to the population as a whole. Furthermore, partic-ipants in this sample were predominantly White, and all resided in a less populated area of the central Great Plains region. As such, partic-ipants’ geographic and cultural contexts must be taken into account Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       38in the interpretation of results, with participants identifying a strong salience of gender to their experiences and with a few exceptions, far less explicit acknowledgment of the ways in which race, ability, and class also intersect to shape experience. The predominance of partic-ipants who benefited from White privilege in our study likely contrib-uted to our study findings, where happiness was described as being in-dividually derived and experienced, rather than grounded and shaped within community and in response to systemic dynamics. Method-ologically, analytic rigor was established through the robust consen-sus coding process that carefully followed constructivist grounded the-ory steps outlined by Charmaz (2014) and supplemented by regular team meetings to clarify analytic processes and procedures, decision-making, and iterative refinement of emerging categories and themes. The first author also completed an audit of the data, highlighting in-dividual codes to be cross-coded or moved to reinforce category dis-tinction, and suggesting changes to category and theme names to en-hance conceptual clarity. However, an additional step some qualitative researchers take to enhance methodological rigor and mitigate risk of bias in qualitative analysis is member checking (Levitt et al., 2017, 2018), an additional limitation in this study is that we did not employ this step in the absence of obtaining IRB consent to contact partici-pants following the study. In conclusion, this study contributes significantly to the literature on TNB well-being by exploring one subjectively experienced aspect of well-being, happiness. Findings clearly support the rich, overlap-ping, and recursive ways happiness is experienced by TNB individuals within and across core aspects of self and point to a need for contin-ued research into promoting well-being. Specifically, researchers can test the hypotheses contained within the developed model to assess the degree to which findings can be generalized to the larger popula-tion, as well as identify areas for further development and differenti-ation within TNB populations.    … … … … … Tebbe et al. in Psych. of Sexual Orientation & Gender Diversity, 2023       39Supplemental materials  The interview protocol and an additional table and nar-rative of findings are included in supplemental materials attached to the archive record for this article.

    "abstract": "Expanding upon the larger body of literature that focuses on adverse mental health concerns among trans and nonbinary (TNB) populations, emerging research has recently begun to investigate positive outcomes and psychological well-being among TNB people. This study contributes to this growing area of research by investigating one subjectively experienced aspect of well-being—happiness—among TNB adults residing in the central Great Plains region of the United States. For this study, 20 TNB adults participated in semistructured interviews where they were asked to reflect on how they experienced happiness generally and in relation to being TNB, and what fostered or impeded their happiness. Data were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory analysis (Charmaz, 2014). Four major themes emerged from the data that formed the core components of happiness: Authenticity, Connection to Others, Perspective Shift, and Agency. Two additional major themes included factors that fueled happiness and those that detracted from happiness. Subthemes and categories within each major theme are described. From these themes, a theoretical model of TNB happiness was developed. Theoretical and counseling implications are discussed, along with noted limitations and areas for future research.\nSupplemental materials are attached below",
