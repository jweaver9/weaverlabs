    "abstract": "This is a summary report of the 2020 survey of the Swiss LGBTIQ+ Panel. The Swiss LGBTIQ+ Panel, a longitudinal study assessing the situation of LGBTIQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex, and queer) individuals in Switzerland in an annual manner, is led by Léïla Eisner and Tabea Hässler. Each annual survey covers emerging topics in the Swiss context (e.g., legalization of same-sex marriage), personal experiences of LGBTIQ+ individuals (e.g., support, discrimination, coming out, experiences in the school context) as well as action to change the situation in Switzerland. We believe that the insights of the Swiss LGBTIQ+ Panel have high practical relevance for LGBTIQ+ and cis-heterosexual individuals, people in the educational context, LGBTIQ+ and other non-profit organizations, practitioners, and policymakers aiming at promoting the health and integration of LGBTIQ+ individuals",
