    "fullText": "12Amicus Curiae   Issue 82   Summer 2010The theme of the Ecclesiastical Law Society’s 2010Day Conference, held on March 13 in London, was“Freedom of religion: protection or equality?”One of the speakers, Lucy Vickers, professor of law atOxford Brookes University and specialist on religiousdiscrimination in the workplace, declared that in heropinion the fundamental ground for legally protectingreligious belief and practice is the essential irrationality ofreligious positions: since their truth cannot, unlikescientific views, be demonstrated, they need the protectionof the law even more than do other ideas.  Another speaker,Christopher McCrudden, professor of human rights law atthe University of Oxford, indicated that he felt veryuncomfortable with this argument, though there was notime at the conference to go into the issue in depth.Then, a little over a month later (April 29), Lord JusticeLaws issued his opinion in the case of McFarlane v RelateAvon Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ B1 on appeal from theEmployment Appeal Tribunal. Gary McFarlane, arelationships counselor in Bristol with strong evangelicalChristian beliefs, had refused to provide sexual counselingto homosexual couples; as a result, he was dismissed by theRelate Avon organisation, whose position was upheld bythe Employment Tribunal. Lord Justice Laws deniedMcFarlane’s subsequent application to have his case heardby the Court of Appeal. The Lord Justice gave his ratio asfollows: “[I]n the eye of everyone save the believerreligious faith is necessarily subjective, beingincommunicable by any kind of proof or evidence. . . . [I]tlies only in the heart of the believer, who is alone bound byit.  No one else is or can be so bound, unless by his ownfree choice he accepts its claims.  The promulgation of lawfor the protection of a position held purely on religiousgrounds cannot therefore be justified. It is irrational, aspreferring the subjective over the objective” (paras 23-24).These remarks created a considerable flap in the press,and former Archbishop George Carey took sharp issuewith Lord Justice Laws’ refusal to allow McFarlane’sappeal.  Some critics reasoned ad hominem, condemningLaws LJ on the basis of his reputation as a “legal activist.”  But the especially interesting aspect of the  decision isthat, whilst agreeing entirely with Professor Vickers’ viewthat religion is essentially subjective, and thereforeunprovable and irrational, Laws LJ concludes that, insteadof particularly deserving the protection of the law, religiousclaims must not be upheld legally against the (non-religious) views of others. In other words, from thepremise of religious irrationality, Vickers and Laws drawprecisely opposite conclusions!In the present essayist’s view, neither Vickers nor Laws iscorrect, and for three compelling reasons: (1) It isincorrect to suppose that ideological conflicts in society pit“religious” beliefs against “non-religious” positions. (2)Religious beliefs are not necessarily irrational. (3) A properbasis for the protection – and the limitation – of religiouspractices must be found in an entirely different realm fromthat of supposed “religious irrationality.”  Let us brieflyspeak to each of these points.1. The 20th-century theologian Paul Tillich stressed thatthere are in fact no atheists, since everyone has an“ultimate concern”—a value system determining his orher actions individually and societally. Thus, inMcFarlane, Relate Avon, no less than McFarlane himself,held religious convictions—for Relate Avon, thathomosexual relationships are ethically proper and assuch deserve the benefits of sexual counseling no lessthan heterosexual relationships. Lord Justice Lawshimself therefore acted irrationally in rejecting ongrounds of religious irrationality McFarlane’s overtreligiosity in favour of Relate Avon’s unstated, but noless religious, value system.2. As for the claim by Vickers and Laws that religions areper se irrational, we might paraphrase George Orwell:  allreligions are equal, but some are more equal than others.There are indeed religions such as Buddhism that rely100 per cent on personal, subjective experience asverification for their beliefs, as well as cultic movementssuch as Scientology having no way of objectivelydemonstrating the factuality of their doctrines (eg, that“body thetans” are the product of Xenu of the GalacticConfederacy and need to be treated through therapeutic“auditing” processes).  But this is hardly a description allreligious phenomena.  An obvious counter-example isclassic Christian faith, which centres on the historicalfacts of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.  Thecenturies-old discipline of Christian apologetics hasoffered powerful objective evidences for the truth of theChristian worldview; one thinks of the work of Pascal,Religious “irrationality” andcivil libertiesby John Warwick Montgomery13Amicus Curiae   Issue 82   Summer 2010William Paley, John Henry Newman, C S Lewis, RichardSwinburne—and lawyers such as Hugo Grotius (Deveritate religionis Christianae), Simon Greenleaf (TheTestimony of the Evangelists)—and Sir Norman Anderson,late director of the University of London’s Institute ofAdvanced Legal Studies (The Evidence for the Resurrection).In recent years, the arguments for cosmic, universal“intelligent design” as presented by scientists such asWilliam Dembski and Francis Collins have brought evendistinguished atheistic philosophers (eg, Antony Flew)to belief in God.  3. Where, then, should one go to find an adequate basis forthe protection of religious beliefs and practices—andproper grounds for limiting them?  The answer is not tolabel religion as “irrational” and then to draw positive ornegative conclusions from that characterisation, butrather to consider far more carefully the properfunction of law in general in an open society.  Aspolitical philosopher John Rawls emphasised by way ofhis First Principle of Justice (that dealing with civilliberties): “Each person is to have an equal right to themost extensive scheme of equal basic libertiescompatible with a similar scheme of liberties forothers.”  This means that unless one’s belief or desiredactivity—including religious belief and activity—hurtsothers, it should be allowed.  It also means that if thecourts can find a way for a belief or activity to functionwithout significant hurt to others, that belief or activityshould be legitimated.  In the McFarlane matter,therefore, since other relationship counsellors holdingworldviews other than McFarlane’s could readily treatthe homosexual couples, McFarlane should have beenallowed to retain his position—respect being shown tohis personal beliefs by allowing him to give sex therapyonly to heterosexual couples.  (This is in line withmedical practice in many civilized countries, wherephysicians and nurses opposing abortion do not havetheir public hospital privileges taken away, but areexempted from performing abortions and instead areassigned to perform other medical procedures.)There is a further consideration of the greatestconsequence to the judicial evaluation of religious beliefand practice.  That principle is encapsulated in a celebratedremark attributed to Voltaire: “I may not agree with whatyou say but I will defend to the death your right to say it.”In an open society, even beliefs regarded by some as“irrational” need to be tolerated. Why? Because of theinherent dignity of the human persons holding those ideas.We need a free marketplace of ideas, not a society wheresome ideas  (religious ones, for example) are given suchsecond-class status that actions dependent on them are perse removed from legal protection—even when their allegedharm to the society cannot be demonstrated. Today, incertain European states, one can be jailed for unpopularideas (holocaust revisionism, for example); such obnoxiousnotions ought to be refuted in the public marketplace ofideas, not repressed by law.  Religious beliefs, even thosewe disagree with, need to expressed—and practiced—inan open society.  And, surely, those religious positions withsolid, objective evidence in their behalf must not sufferostracism simply because of their religious label!Otherwise, political correctness will prevail, and politicalcorrectness is no less a religion because it does not use thatterminology. Indeed, in many ways it is far more dangerousto the public weal than are the religious ideas and practicesit endeavours to repress.
