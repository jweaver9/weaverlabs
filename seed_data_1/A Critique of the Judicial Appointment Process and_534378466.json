CONCLUSION...................................................................................248I. INTRODUCTIONThe manner by which judges are appointed (“Judicial Appointment”)has enormous implications for the Rule of Law.1 Politicization of thejudiciary and subordination of judges to interested constituencies can threatenthe underpinnings of a strong democracy.2The United States is a common law country that employs JudicialAppointment systems at the federal, state, and local levels that differ1. See James D. Wilets & Camilo Espinosa, Rule of Law in Haiti Before andAfter the 2010 Earthquake, 6 INTERCULTURAL HUM. RTS. L. REV. 181, 183–84 (2011); F.C.DeCoste, Political Corruption, Judicial Selection, and the Rule of Law, 38 ALTA. L. REV. 654,668 (2000). “Rule of [L]aw” has been defined as a system of law which contains the followingelements: (1) the government is bound, and its citizens governed, by laws which are clear andprospective in nature; (2) supremacy of law over personal, pecuniary or political considerations;(3) efficient and predictable enforcement of law; (4) efficient and predictable interpretation ofthe law; (5) equality of persons before the law among all persons similarly situated; (6)implementation of, and respect for, human rights and other individual rights in a manner notinconsistent with international standards; (7) accountability of government officials for theirfailure to apply or conform to the law. Wilets & Espinosa, supra (footnotes omitted).2. See Samuel L. Bufford, Defining the Rule of Law, 46 JUDGES’ J., 2007, at16, 20–21. This issue is all the more pertinent today as the Executive Branch has, in the recentpast, explicitly articulated a goal of using the judiciary to advance the personal political goalsof a particular president; undermining the separation of powers, which has been traditionallyviewed as an important component of the Rule of Law, and placing the personal interests of thepresident over those of the country in a manner that supersedes even the concerns that promptedthe development of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. See id.; Rebecca R.Ruiz et al., A Conservative Agenda Unleashed on the Federal Courts, N.Y. TIMES,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/trump-appeals-court-judges.html (last updated Mar.16, 2020).2022] A CRITIQUE OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS 203significantly from those used in other common law and civil law systems.3Examining those differences provides an opportunity to assess deficiencies inthe American Judicial Appointment system while simultaneously determiningthe aspects of those systems that could improve the American legal system andstrengthen the Rule of Law.4The systems discussed in this article seek to reconcile three goals inthe Judicial Appointment process: (1) judicial independence, so that judgescan adjudicate based on a neutral interpretation of the law and in a non-politicized manner, (2) judicial accountability to the body politic, and (3)appointment of qualified judges based on merit who are capable of followingthe Rule of Law regardless of the specific Judicial Appointment systemadopted.5This Article posits that the United States’ systems of judicial reviewat the federal and state level, employing a mix of political and partisanappointment methods, do not satisfy the above-articulated goals.6 Forexample, judicial election—which is primarily used at the state level—maysatisfy political accountability, but severely limits judicial independence andthe appointment of the most qualified judges.7 Similarly, the appointment ofjudges in the United States based primarily on political considerations doesnot satisfy any of the above-articulated goals.8The principal distinctions between the United States’ systems ofJudicial Appointment and most other legal systems are the manner in which3.

L.J. 553,555–56, 561 (2014) (“[T]he accountability theory is about holding judges accountable formistakes (intentional and unintentional), for ignoring the law, for imposing their own views ofthe law, and for ethical misconduct, but not for correct decisions that the public does not like,or that the public does not understand.”); see also Charles Gardner Geyh, Rescuing JudicialAccountability from the Realm of Political Rhetoric, 56 CASE W. RSVR. L. REV. 911, 916, 924(2006). The Judicial Independence Theory provides for a judiciary free of being bound to astate legislature, governor, or public will, and rather use the law solely to decide cases.

TIMES, May 25, 2008, at 1.204 NOVA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 46judges are trained, and the United States’ relatively unusual use of electionsfor Judicial Appointment.9With respect to the training of judges, many countries utilize the CivilService Model, which trains potential judges directly out of law school in anon-partisan manner.10 This contrasts sharply with the United States’ systemof judicial training, where judges are appointed later in their careers basedchiefly on partisan considerations.11 Thus, rather than utilizing elections orappointments based on political considerations, countries using this modeldraw upon a professionalized pool of judicial nominees in merit-basedappointments.12 Unlike the United States, the pool of judicial candidates fromwhich merit-based appointments are made are less likely to be closelyaffiliated with a particular political party or ideology.13II. IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM TO BE REMEDIED: RULE OF LAW ANDJUDICIAL POLITICIZATION IN THE UNITED STATESArticle II of the United States Constitution states that the “[President]shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shallappoint” United States Supreme Court members.14 Supreme Court Justicesare granted lifetime tenure and cannot be removed, except throughimpeachment. 15 Life tenure was meant to enhance judicial independence byseparating the judiciary from political branches and insulate the justices frompartisan passions.16 The Founders’ concerns of balancing judicialindependence and accountability were central determinants in creating the9.

There is also agreement that subjecting judges toperiodic checks conducted by the public or its elected officials, suchas reelection or reappointment, may lead to more accountablecourts. Where commentators diverge is over how the balancebetween independence and accountability should be struck. Whilesome argue for lifetime appointments to induce independence,others hold that accountability requires a threat of enforcement,including the possibility of removal by the people or theirrepresentatives.18However, the appointment of judges and how they maintain theirposition are separate issues, the core of this Article focuses on the initialphase of appointment.*A. Bush v. GoreOne of the most salient examples of the pernicious effects of thepoliticization of the judicial appointment process with a concurrent loss ofindependent, non-partisan judicial decision-making, is Bush v. Gore.19 Thiscase arose out of the vote count in Florida during the 2000 presidentialelection.20 In this case, Vice President Al Gore contested the Florida electionresults, in which there was a voting margin difference of 537 votes in favor ofRepublican Texas Governor George W. Bush out of almost a total of 6 million17. See id. Alexander Hamilton most famously expressed this view inFederalist No. 78, one of a series of essays designed to garner support for the ratification of theConstitution.

Bush.30The Court refused to have its own majority opinion decision treatedas binding precedent, strongly suggesting it had little faith that its reasoningwas sufficient to constitute binding legal precedent for future cases.31 TheCourt’s internal inconsistency went beyond contradicting the traditionaljudicially conservative deference to states’ rights and state courts—a judicialprinciple putatively embraced by the majority.32 The conservative justices’contradiction of their own judicially conservative tenets of judicial restraint,deference to the states, and its refusal to treat its own decision as bindingprecedent, constitutes a highly unusual and explicitly result-orienteddecision.33 Indeed, the dissent noted the traditional (frequently conservative)view that the Court is supposed to “accord[] respectful consideration and greatweight to the views of the State’s highest court.”34Bush provides one of the best examples of the problems with partisanJudicial Appointment affecting judicial decision-making and therebyundermining Rule of Law.35 The dissent in this case reflected this view of thecase as unwarranted judicial review.36[An undervote] occurs when the number of choices selected by a voter inan election contest is less than the maximum number allowed for that contest. Anundervote also occurs when there are no votes for a single choice contest. Forexample, a voter that is permitted to cast one vote for a candidate and does not selecta candidate has undervoted.

METHODS OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT IN THE UNITED STATESThe individual states in the United States have adopted several meansof Judicial Appointment: direct appointment, merit-based appointment by acommission or bar committee, and contested elections either non-partisan orpartisan.45 In addition, there have been proposals for a hybrid of the processesabove.46 Although the basic processes seem clear cut, no two states haveadopted identical selection processes.47 In fact, many states have notconformed to one single selection process and have instead adopted more thanone to select judges at different levels of the court system.48A. Direct AppointmentThere are two types of direct appointment: (1) gubernatorial and (2)legislative.49 The gubernatorial appointment system is one by which theGovernor appoints a candidate without the recommendation of a nominationcommission.50 In some cases, the appointment may require confirmation byan executive council or legislature.51 “There are variations within such41.

Merit-Based AppointmentMerit-based appointment is the most prevalent method of appointingstate appellate judges in the United States.69 No state that has adopted it hasever wholly abandoned it.70 This type of selection method is based onprofessional merit and qualifications—impartiality, experiences, legalexpertise, and temperament—rather than politics.71 Most states have adopteda variation of the merit-based system, which avoids many of the problems withdelegating the appointment power solely to the governor.72Because of the pitfalls in giving governors sole discretion in JudicialAppointment, many states have adopted the assisted appointment system—inwhich nominating bodies are formed for the initial selection of potential63.

NON-POLITICAL CHECK ON JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTSThe American Bar Association (“ABA”) was founded in 1878 toadvance the rule of law across the United States to provide practical resourcesfor legal professionals, model ethics codes, and more.114 The ABA is thelargest voluntary bar association of lawyers and law students in the UnitedStates and is responsible for law school accreditation and continuing legaleducation for legal professionals.115 It has also served a role in recommendingJudicial Appointment at various levels.116 Unfortunately, this involvement bya non-partisan civic organization has recently been eroded.117 For example,former President Trump curtailed the involvement of organizations such as theABA, choosing to appoint judges based on their loyalty to a particular politicalagenda rather than their ability to uphold the professional standards and Ruleof Law.118The ABA first created the Model Rules of Professional Conduct in1908 and the standards for law school accreditation in 1952.119 Also, in 1952,the ABA Standing Committee reached an agreement with the U.S. Departmentworld . . . is stunned and amazed at what [America does], and vaguely aghast . . . the idea thatjudges with absolutely no judge-specific educational training are running political campaigns isboth insane and characteristically American.” Id. at 21.111.

Hungary.130 Hungary adopted a new Constitution in 2011 whichrestructured its existing judiciary system.131 Andras Baka was the president ofthe Hungarian Supreme Court, which before the restructure was the highestcourt in the country.132 Baka was elected by the Parliament in 2009 to serve asix-year term set to expire in 2015.133 As president of the Supreme Court, hehad an explicit legal obligation to express his opinion on parliamentary billsaffecting the judiciary.134In 2011, as the government began to take steps towards a newConstitution, Baka publicly criticized several legislative reforms affecting thejudiciary such as the lowering of the mandatory retirement age.135 The newConstitution, called the Fundamental Law, was adopted in spring of 2011.136With its adoption, the highest court in the country was now named Kuria andthe Supreme Court was terminated along with Baka’s mandate.137 TheConstitution ended Baka’s tenure three and a half years too early and left himunable to challenge the decision in a Hungarian court.138 The Kuria kept thesame powers and competencies as the former Supreme Court and retained allits judges, but left Baka as the odd man out when it terminated his position.139The new criteria in place for selecting a president of the Kuria also excludedBaka from applying to the new position because the criteria specificallyexcluded the time he served as a judge of an international court.140 Baka hadserved sixteen years as a judge of the European Court of Human Rights butonly served two and a half years as a national judge, where the new criteria forpresident of the Kuria required five years of experience.141 This was simply128.

INT'L L. 297, 307 (2013).2022] A CRITIQUE OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS 247The Supreme Court of India is considered one of the largest and mostpowerful in the world.437 This is mainly because India’s practice of judicialappointments insulates the judicial branch from other branches ofgovernment.438 Currently, the Supreme Court is made up of about thirtyjudges, including the Chief Justice.439 India’s judicial appointment essentiallyhas two steps.440 First, the Chief Justice consults the four most senior justicessitting on the Supreme Court.441 The collegium determines who is worthy ofthe appointment through consultation.442 Second, after coming to a consensus,the Chief Justice makes a recommendation to the President, who then makesthe appointment.443 Although the collegium’s unanimous recommendation isnot binding and the President may return the advice of the cabinet forreconsideration, the President’s role is, in effect, merely ceremonial andformal to ensure judicial independence.444To be considered for appointment as a Supreme Court Justice, thecandidate must be “a citizen of India,” under sixty-five years old, “a Judge ofa High Court (or of two or more such Courts in succession) for [at least] fiveyears,” an Advocate of the equivalent “for at least ten years, or, in the opinionof the President, a ‘distinguished’ jurist.”445 Essentially, Judges of theSupreme Court can be appointed through “promotion from the High Courtor . . . direct appointment by advocates or renowned jurists.”446Once appointed, a justice’s term is limited by the mandatoryretirement age of sixty-five.447 Although the justices are not explicitly givena fixed term, the mandatory retirement age, and the common practice ofappointing justices, is between the ages of fifty-eight to sixty, which results in437.

CONCLUSIONThe United States, along with other democracies have struggled withinherent tensions between judicial independence, maintaining a depoliticizedjudiciary, and holding the judiciary accountable to the body politic.451 In manycases, this tension cannot be resolved.452 For example, increasing judicialindependence almost necessarily results in less public accountability.453However, certain aspects of non-U.S. legal systems would arguably improvejudicial independence and Rule of Law without sacrificing accountability.454First, the preparation of judges in a professional and non-partisansystem of judicial track education, such as the Civil Service Model, woulddecrease the problem in the United States where judges are being appointedsolely based on their previous political work.455 Such a system of professionaleducation is practiced in France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.456 Theadvantages of a system of non-partisan judicial education are that it increasesjudicial independence and promotes Rule of Law, while not affecting theactual appointment process.457Second, electoral appointment of judges presents a serious problem inany legal system.458 At the appointment stage, judges are required to run foroffice just like a politician, vastly reducing scrutiny of the judge’s professional448.

This may not be a problem on its own, but recentresearch suggests that not all content spreads at the same rate.Research from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)suggests that false content spreads up to six times faster than factualcontent on social media sites and false news stories are seventypercent more likely to be shared.8074.

Rather, it is the dignitaryharm inflicted on the subject herself.”103 Greater still is the disproportionateimpact that deepfakes can have when used to blackmail people withinvulnerable populations, like the LGBTQ+ community, that oftentimes findthemselves hiding in the shadows.104 The concept of data exploitation for thepurposes of blackmailing or harming the LGBTQ+ community is not a newone, and historical data, in addition to modern concerns over dating apps,seems to suggest that the threat is magnified for such communities.105This kind of data exploitation is very much in line with the morearchaic forms of data exploitation that have threatened the LGBTQ+community throughout various points in history.106 During the height of theNazi regime, the Gestapo raided sex research institutions and confiscatedextensive lists containing the names and addresses of local homosexuals.107Those listed became the targets of the Reich Central Office for the Combattingof Homosexuality and Abortion.108 The Nazis arrested over 100,000 men ashomosexuals and took some of these men to concentration camps where they99.

STOP, DROP, OR ROLL WITH ITWhile numerous scholars, technologists, and governmentrepresentatives have advocated for the development of new policy initiativesto specifically address the growing concern surrounding deepfake media andits implications, this Article focuses more squarely on the adaptation of currentlaws in order to provide recourse to those harmed by deepfake media, and onthe legislative efforts that can be taken to secure the privacy and safety ofmembers of the LGBTQ+ community in light of the potential for that content’smisuse.132A. The Regulation RaceWith the public’s understanding of deepfake technology continuing togrow, and its concerns for its misuse growing with it, one question has becomemore prevalent among many others—if technology created the problem,shouldn’t technology be the thing to offer the solution?133 In 2020, Congresspassed the first deepfake-specific statute—not one addressing any regulatorystructure, but rather one incentivizing research into the development ofdeepfake detection software similar to the one depicted below that uses a bluebox to track head rotation, red dots to map facial expressions, and green beamsto detect the direction of eye movement.134129.

Prodigy Services Co.,161 Congress members grew concerned that thecourt’s ruling would disincentivize the moderation of offensive content postedto internet service providers by third parties.162 As a result, Congress passedthe Communications Decency Act and included in it, Section 230, whichoffers internet service providers a broad shield of immunity from liability formoderating too much or too little of their third party users’ speech.163However, the absence of narrow language in Section 230’s immunityclauses has come to be interpreted in a manner that is so broad that it hascreated yet another problem—immunity remains available even if an internetservice provider intentionally encourages the posting of harmful content.164 Infact, when it has been applied, this expansive immunity has allowed internetservice providers to republish content with the knowledge that it violates thelaw, alter their platform to prevent the capture of criminals, and allow the saleof illegal or dangerous products.165 For example, Grindr, a dating appmarketed primarily to the gay community, often sees fake profiles on itsplatform wherein a user appropriates the images, whether more commonplaceor intimate, of another (“catfishing”).166 Recently, one of Grindr’s users,Matthew Herrick, sued the company for the negligent design of its applicationafter Herrick’s ex-boyfriend began impersonating him on the app by creatinga fake profile in his name, spreading his nude photographs, and sharing rape157.

Grindr, LLC172 can be adapted to illustratethe point in action.173 User A of a social media platform either creates orobtains a deepfake that impersonates User B, and depicts B in some intimateact without their knowledge or consent.174 User A uploads the harmful oroffensive deepfake to a social media platform, where the content spreads andgets shared.175 Upon discovery of the deepfake content, B requests that theplatform remove it on account of the professional, reputational andpsychological harm that the synthetic media creates.176 The platform neverremoves the content, it continues to spread and harm B, and B sues theplatform.177 Under the current framework of Section 230, it would beunreasonable to expect that the adapted facts would yield a conclusiondifferent than the one in Herrick, despite the platform’s actual knowledge ofthe harmful or offensive nature of the content in question and of the damagethat it causes.178 Herein lies the heart of the problem, worse even, when the167.

The Early Days of Radio RegulationsThe year was 1912 and the world was starting to get a larger glimpseinto the utilization of radio communication.33 At the time, radio signals werenot well established and radios were not widely used by United Statescitizens.34 Many frequencies were used for United States military personnel,but the United States government did not have exclusive control over radiowaves.35 In fact, the majority of radio frequencies led to overlapping, andconsequently ineffective, signals.36 A lack of formal regulation meantinterfering frequencies and many inconsistencies.37The watershed moment for realizing the need for radiocommunication regulation was arguably the sinking of the Titanic in theNorthern Atlantic Ocean.38 The Royal Mail Ship (“RMS”) Titanic sent out adistress call that was heard in the northern regions of Canada, specifically inNewfoundland.39 However, the distress call was masked by interference fromamateur, unregulated radio stations throughout the east coast of the UnitedStates.40 These interfering frequencies caused a delayed emergency response30.

Prodigy Servs. Co.,96 where the New York Supreme Courtwas again tasked with determining whether a website should be held as apublisher of statements made by an anonymous user on an online forum.97 ThePlaintiff-brokerage firm—which ultimately dissolved because it defraudedshareholders resulting in many shareholders being arrested andincarcerated98—sued the defendant-website for defamatory comments thatwere made anonymously on a message board.99 The plaintiff asserted that thedefendant should be held responsible as a publisher because the defendant helditself out as a moderator of the content that was published on its messageboards.100 In fact, the defendant used a software screening program toautomatically prescreen board postings for offensive language.101 The NewYork court agreed with the plaintiff and granted summary judgment in its favoron the issue of whether the defendant acted as a publisher of speech.102 Indoing so, the court distinguished the facts from Cubby by noting that thedefendant, in that case, had little to no editorial control over the content ofthose publications, whereas the defendant, in this case, made decisions as tothe content, and such decisions constituted editorial control.103 This ruling,along with Cubby, helped set the stage for the Communication Decency Act,which was incorporated under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.10495.

FCC,139 the United States Court of Appeals wastasked with determining whether the FCC had authority to enforce the OIOand regulate ISPs that had interfered with customers’ internet access.140 Thecourt held that the FCC did not have authority to regulate ISPs because theinternet was classified under Title I of the Communications Act.141 This rulingwas quintessential in developing net neutrality principles because, in theirexplanation, the court laid the foundation for how the FCC could ultimatelyacquire authority over ISPs.142 The court reasoned that the FCC could notenforce the net neutrality regulations while the internet was classified as an133.

FCC,146 the court held thatthe FCC did not have the authority to hold ISPs to nondiscriminatory policiesand common carrier regulations because of the title classification of theinternet.147 This ruling was a landmark case for the FCC because it clearlydemonstrated the means in which the FCC could implement net neutralityregulations.148 Verizon ultimately led to the reclassification of the internetonce more, since it showed the FCC a new avenue of achieving netneutrality.149In 2015, the FCC released an updated Open Internet Order that wouldallow equal, uninhibited distribution of data to all internet users in the UnitedStates by reclassifying ISPs as a telecommunication service, recognizing theinternet as a “common carrier” subject to Title II standards of theCommunications Act.150 True to its name, the Open Internet Order wasintended to preserve internet openness.151 Specifically, the Act stated thefollowing:Given that broadband providers—both fixed and mobile—have both the incentives and ability to harm the open Internet, weagain conclude that the relatively small incremental burdensimposed by our rules are outweighed by the benefits of preservingthe open nature of the Internet, including the continued growth ofthe virtuous cycle of innovation, consumer demand, and investment.We note, for example, that the disclosure requirements adopted inthis order are widely understood, have industry-based definitions,and are commonly used in commercial Service Level Agreementsby many broadband providers.

Open Internetrules are also critical for ensuring that people living and working inrural areas can take advantage of the substantial benefits that theopen Internet has to offer. In minority communities where manyindividuals’ only Internet connection may be through a mobiledevice, robust open Internet rules help make sure these communitiesare not negatively impacted by harmful broadband providerconduct. Such rules additionally provide essential safeguards toensure that the Internet flourishes as a platform for education andresearch.152In essence, common carrier status means that a service cannot vary thetype or quality of access it provides to users.153 A common carrier is held tothe highest legal standard of care in providing a service, maintaining theutmost level of liability for occurrences caused during the administration oftheir service.154 For the internet, it basically meant that ISPs could no longerblock access to websites and were required to maintain the speed and qualityof their services.155 As it relates to prioritizing certain information over others,the Order addressed this as follows:A person engaged in the provision of broadband Internetaccess service, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall notengage in paid prioritization. “Paid prioritization” refers to themanagement of a broadband provider’s network to directly orindirectly favor some traffic over other traffic, including throughuse of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, resourcereservation, or other forms of preferential traffic management,either (a) in exchange for consideration (monetary or otherwise)from a third party, or (b) to benefit an affiliated entity.156This classification had some major implications, especially forprotecting consumers.157 Consumers benefited from the classification becauseit ensured that their private data was handled with the utmost level of care.158152.

Challenges to Net NeutralityA notable downside to the reclassification was the possibility ofcreating monopolies and reducing private spending on infrastructure.160 Thispotential for monopolization was conceivable by understanding that increasedregulations can result in higher barriers of entry to the ISP market, due to theexpensive precautions that ISPs would need to take in delivering secure,uninhibited internet access.161 The maintenance of regulations may alsoredirect private spending by ISPs away from innovative development oftechnology and infrastructure.162 This could be problematic because the abilityto maintain efficacy as more internet users come online can be hindered by thelack of innovation and infrastructure to support those users.163In 2017, the Trump administration took control of the White House,which was accompanied by the newly appointed chairman of the FCC.164 AjitPai, who had served on the FCC under the Obama administration, hadpreviously served as general counsel for Verizon, one of the big three ISPs.165The FCC began to work on the repeal of net neutrality, asserting that thereclassification of ISPs would create an increase in economic stimulation inthe private technology sector, and consequently lower the barriers for entryinto the ISP marketplace.166 In January 2018, the Open Internet Order wasofficially repealed and ISPs would soon be allowed to return to the way thingswere before.167Unfortunately, not long after the repeal, the state of California wasfaced with its first major issue arising out of the newly reestablished Title I159.

CONCLUSIONRecently, Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion thatdiscussed the legal difficulties in applying old doctrines to new technologyand digital platforms.233 In the lower court, the Second Circuit held that thecomment threads on Twitter were a public forum in justifying its holding.234But many argued that if Twitter comment threads—which make up themajority of the platform—are held to be public forums, they should not betreated as such.235 The Court has previously held, as a matter of law, that apublic forum is subject to the highest judicial scrutiny under the FirstAmendment.236 As such, the government may not regulate speech in a publicforum, unless it meets judicial strict scrutiny.237 However, social mediaplatforms, like Twitter, are given immunity from civil lawsuits for regulatingspeech on their platform, yet they are held to be a public forum in the eyes ofthe Second Circuit.238 In addressing this, Justice Thomas stated the following:Today’s digital platforms provide avenues for historicallyunprecedented amounts of speech, including speech by governmentactors. Also unprecedented, however, is the concentrated control ofso much speech in the hands of a few private parties. We will soonhave no choice but to address how our legal doctrines apply tohighly concentrated, privately owned information infrastructuresuch as digital platforms.239With that in mind, it is easy to see the inconsistency in allowingplatforms, such as Twitter, to be free to regulate speech as they please without232.

INTRODUCTIONIt is well established that the First Amendment’s free speech clausedoes not protect the production or exchange of real child pornography—material that exhibits the real abuse or sexual conduct of children.1 However,virtual child pornography, where no real children are required for itsproduction, is still a widely contended topic among courts.2 Althoughseemingly simple, this subject walks a fine line between the protection of freespeech and the public interest in protecting children from abuse.3 With theoverwhelming advancements in editing and digital technology, there haveundoubtedly been new obstacles for lawmakers and prosecutors in terms ofcreating laws to control this issue.4 These advancements have made it difficultto distinguish between what images contain real children and what imagescontain, so called, fake children or some other hybrid form.5There are three general categories of virtual child pornography.6 Thefirst is computer-generated child pornography, which is made without the useof real children or images of real children.7 Therefore, the children depictedin these sorts of films are completely fictional and fabricated.8 The second ischild pornography that is created with the use of youthful-looking adults whorole play as children.9 Both are considered legal, as the first does not involvethe harming or use of real children and the second involves films or imagesbetween consenting adults.10 The focus of this Comment is on the thirdcategory—morphed child pornography—a subject that falls in the middle ofwhat is considered real child pornography and completely computer-generatedchild pornography.11 Morphing is developed by using actual photos or videos1.

Mecham16 brought the issue before the Fifth Circuit.17 The FifthCircuit acknowledged the arguments on both sides, but ultimately joined theSecond and Sixth Circuits in its decision to exclude morphing from FirstAmendment protection.18 More importantly, the court in Mecham dissectedand rejected the main argument brought forth in the Eighth Circuit, whichsupports that morphing should be categorized as protected speech.19 Further,the Supreme Court decided not to review the decision in United States v.Mecham.20 Thus, the Supreme Court has failed to guide courts on how toaddress this issue uniformly.21This Comment will discuss the legislative history of childpornography, the different cases and arguments surrounding the current circuitsplit, and the newest case to add an opinion on the issue of morphed childpornography.22 Ultimately, this Comment will argue that morphed childpornography should not fall within the protections of the First Amendmentand that the absence of clear precedent on this issue, along with conflictingarguments across circuits calls for judicial review at the Supreme Court level.2312.

THE SOCIETAL IMPACT OF VIRTUAL CHILD PORNOGRAPHYThe sexual abuse and exploitation of children through childpornography has always been a significant national concern.24 Unfortunately,the internet has created new avenues for child abusers to commit crimes behindthe comfort of their screens.25 According to the United States SentencingCommission, more than half of all internet child pornography content is ofinfants and toddlers.26 Thus, not only does internet child pornography exploitthe weakest members of our society, but it also creates a forum in which abuseis permanent and can be further circulated.27 Children who fall victim to anyform of child pornography on the internet experience extreme emotional andpsychological harm.28 Child pornography has shown to be a new form ofabuse since child molesters no longer have to physically abuse their victims.29Instead, they can easily manipulate child victims into performing acts orposing for a camera, which can later be used for sexual purposes.30 Victimsof this abuse often suffer from anxiety, depression, isolation, and may evendevelop their own sexual behavioral issues.31 For obvious reasons, the mostnegative outcomes appear in individuals who have experienced abuse from afather figure or have experienced abuse for a long duration of time.32Similarly, victims whose images have circulated the web experiencedeep shame and embarrassment at the thought that someone will recognizethem from images of their abuse.33 As a result, victims of child pornographyare forced to relive their abuse over and over again.34 Clinical psychologistsnote that many victims struggle to identify a time when their abuse ended andcannot find closure, even as adults.3524.

HISTORY OF REGULATIONS SURROUNDING REAL AND VIRTUALCHILD PORNOGRAPHY IN THE UNITED STATESAlthough the sexual abuse and exploitation of children are as old ashumanity itself, internet child pornography is a relatively new phenomenon.64The miniature boom of child pornography occurred around the 1960s, asobscenity laws in other countries loosened.65 For the first time, the UnitedStates set forth regulations to outlaw child pornography and to prohibit itsimportation.66 By the 1980s, the internet had exponentially increased theamount of child pornography that was being produced and traded.67 However,virtual child pornography, particularly morphed content, is what has becomeknown as the legal gray area of this topic.68 The only piece of legislation thatsought to regulate virtual child pornography in the United States wasintroduced in 1996, as the Child Pornography Prevention Act (“CPPA”),which was later overturned in 2002.69A. The Miller Standard and its Application to Child PornographyIn 1973, Miller v. California70 created the current standard of reviewfor obscenity.71 Although not directly relating to restricting childpornography, Miller made an important distinction on what type ofpornography is considered obscene.72 Under the Miller test, the guidelines todetermine whether material is obscene must be:(a) [W]hether ‘the average person, applying contemporarycommunity standards’ would find that the work, taken as a whole,appeals to the prurient interest, . . . (b) whether the work depicts ordescribes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specificallydefined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken64.

New York v. Ferber: Child Pornography as a Compelling StateInterestIn 1982, New York v. Ferber77 established that child pornography isnot protected by the First Amendment’s guarantee of free expression.78 Inaddition, the Supreme Court clarified that the government has a compellinginterest in prosecuting individuals who partake in the creation of childpornography, as the sexual exploitation and abuse of children has always beena national concern.79 Ultimately, the standards set forth in Miller wereirrelevant to the issues of child pornography, as Miller only established thatadult pornography was protected under the First Amendment, so long as thematerials were not obscene.80 Generally, Miller defined obscenity as imageslacking “serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”81 Ultimately,Ferber determined that the Miller case could not be used to examine thematerial of children engaging in sexual conduct and therefore, childpornography did not require proof of obscenity.82In Ferber, the defendant sold two sexually explicit films to anundercover police officer.83 The films depicted young boys engaging in sexualacts.84 Under New York law, “[a] person is guilty of promoting a sexualperformance by a child when, knowing the character and content thereof, he73.

Ohio,117 which made it illegal to possess childpornography.118 Furthermore, the Court in Osborne expressly listed the use ofchild pornography in the seduction process as a valid reason for the state toencourage the destruction of these materials as well as the criminalization oftheir possession.119 However, over time, the absence of clear precedent onvirtual child pornography brought about the introduction of the CPPA.120C. Virtual Child Pornography1. The CPPAIn 1996, Congress sought to regulate virtual child pornography withthe CPPA.121 The CPPA defined child pornography as:(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the use of aminor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; (B) such visualdepiction is [] [a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that is, or is indistinguishable from, that] of a minorengaging in sexually explicit conduct; or (C) such visual depictionhas been created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiableminor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or (D) such visualdepiction is advertised, promoted, presented, described, ordistributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that thematerial is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging insexually explicit conduct.122115.

Ashcroft v. Free Speech CoalitionSoon after the introduction of the CPPA, Ashcroft v. Free SpeechCoalition126 reversed the Act in 2002.127 The Supreme Court in Ashcroft foundthat virtual child pornography was not a compelling government interest, andthat the CPPA was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague.128 Ultimately, theCourt held that virtual child pornography was protected under the FirstAmendment.129 Particularly, Ashcroft focused on the unconstitutionality ofthe Act’s language, such as the phrases “appears to be” and “conveys theimpression.”130 The concern was that this language would allow theprosecution of individuals who created their materials without the use of realchildren.131 Hypothetically, if a producer created a film in which he or sheused a youthful-looking adult movie actor to play the role of a child, then thatproducer could possibly face punishments under the CPPA.132 Similarly, thislanguage would technically prohibit all virtual child pornography despite itspossible literary, artistic, or scientific value.133 For example, the Court citedAcademy Award-winning movies, such as American Beauty, in which there123.

The PROTECT ActThe Court’s decision in Ashcroft was nothing short of controversial.143For some, the decision meant that free speech and the First Amendment werebeing protected to the fullest extent.144 For others, the Court’s decision leftquestions on the definitive legality of virtual child pornography.145 In responseto the decision in Ashcroft, Congress considered a more narrowly tailoredapproach to the provisions struck down in the CPPA.146 On April 03, 2003,134.

Anderson,198 the defendant sent unsolicitedsexually explicit images to his half-sister’s eleven-year-old daughter.199 Oneof the pictures he had sent depicted an adult male and an adult female engagingin sexual intercourse with the caption: “this is what we will do.”200 Thedefendant had superimposed his own face onto that of the male’s body and thevictim’s face onto the female’s body.201 Ultimately, he admitted that hecreated the image and sent it to the victim’s Facebook account.202 Thedefendant moved to dismiss his charges on the basis that the statute wasunconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment.203On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuitreasoned that only visual depictions produced through the sexual abuse of achild fell under unprotected speech.204 Although the court noted the decision191.

Stevens216 to support its argument that child pornography is onlyunprotected by the First Amendment when it displays the criminal abuse ofchildren.217 Additionally, the Court used Stevens to explain that the FirstAmendment’s protections do not rely on a balancing test of costs versusbenefits.218 Instead, it reasoned that First Amendment protection depends205.

THE CASE OF UNITED STATES V. MECHAMIn United States v. Mecham, the Fifth Circuit asked whether the FirstAmendment protects morphed child pornography.226 The court notes that realchild pornography goes unprotected under the First Amendment and thatpornography created with youthful-looking adult actors or completelycomputer-generated children is protected.227 However, the courtacknowledges how morphed child pornography usually falls between theseestablished categories.228In Mecham, the defendant took his computer to a repair shop where itwas discovered that he had used it to store thousands of images of nude adults219.

CONCLUSIONThe court in Anderson mistakenly interpreted the Supreme Court’srhetoric in Stevens.261 Stevens differentiated the issue of child pornographyfrom the issue of animal crushing videos, admitting that child pornography isalways a special case due to its historical establishment as a long standing FirstAmendment exception.262 Simply, the Court in Stevens was describing itsinability to create another First Amendment exception category for animalcrush videos, as there would be no historical support for such a ruling.263Although the Court in Stevens also suggests that there is little need for a cost-benefit analysis in child pornography due to its already established history, itis unlikely that the Court was envisioning the more controversial and gray areacategory of morphed child pornography.264 A cost-benefit analysis wouldlikely be essential for such a contested issue.265 Such an analysis would showthat morphed child pornography poses a significant harm to children andprovides little to no benefit to society.266 Under the reasoning in Mecham, if256.
