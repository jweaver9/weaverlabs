Multiculturalism is good for Australia as it generates resources for our \nchanging workforce. Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria (ECCV) through this Policy Discussion \nPaper provides a voice for Victoria’s multicultural community.  \n \nVictoria would do well to make the most of its human resources and embrace newcomers who want to \nwork no matter where they have been educated and gained their skills and experience. Recent \nresearch shows that the most productive, profitable and innovative organisations are those with a \ndiverse and inclusive workforce.  \n \nWhy then, after 40 years of multiculturalism, do we still find postgraduates from non-English \nbackgrounds working as taxi drivers? Why are young graduates from diverse religious and cultural \nbackgrounds still struggling to make it in the workforce? New challenges and concerns are just starting \nto emerge with job seekers from new and emerging communities excluded, marginalised and even \nfurther disadvantaged by the casualisation of work. \n \nThe Discussion Paper: Work Solutions – Improving Cultural Diversity in the Workplace shows that not \nmuch has changed in the last ten years regarding some of the difficulties migrants and refugees \nexperience in finding jobs. This paper arose from the landmark Work Solutions Forum that ECCV \nconducted in 2013 to map the issues regarding Victoria’s multicultural sector in relation to \nunemployment and under-employment.  \n \nIt provides insights into complex and varied issues that relate to equitable access to employment, \neducation and training for people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. It also provides \npractical strategies and policy solutions. We call for positive action by government and employer \norganisations to create tangible work solutions for new migrants and refugees.  \n \nI pay a special tribute to Joe Caputo OAM JP, our Past Chairperson for driving the employment issue as \na priority for ECCV and for providing the impetus for the Work Solutions public forum and subsequently \nthis paper. I take this opportunity to thank Erik Lloga, Convenor of the ECCV Employment, Education \nand Training Policy Sub-Committee for his passion and guidance in driving the key issues and I thank \nits committee members for their insightful multicultural expertise. I also express a note of appreciation to \nJulie Fam, our intern from the Monash University School of Social Work, for her thorough and diligent \ncommitment in preparing the basis for this paper.  \n \nI commend the recommendations in this Discussion Paper for consideration to all three levels of \ngovernment. \n \n \n \nEddie Micallef \nChairperson  \n4 \n \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n \nEmployment is the central issue for migrants and refugees. In Victoria the discussion continues about \nthe challenges and barriers that migrants from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds face \nwhen seeking meaningful employment appropriate to their skills and experience. In recent decades a \nrange of positive employment policies and programs were developed to assist migrant and refugee job \nseekers and yet, despite this, over 35 per cent of recent migrants experience some difficulty finding their \nfirst job in Australia.1 There is a real risk of entrenched disadvantaged groups emerging, made up of \nunemployed migrants and people from refugee backgrounds including disillusioned young people, \nwomen and newly arrived people. What, if anything, has changed? More needs to be done. Greater \nleadership by government at all levels is required. \n \nInternational research shows that global migration has had a positive impact on the workplace; that \ndiversity is a key driver of innovation and increases equity2,3,4. The Australian Government has \nincreased the Skilled Migration Program. This discussion paper shows that the necessary adjustments \nin the local labour market and recruitment strategies in the public sector workplace have lagged behind \nthose trends. It is essential that migration policies and programs be linked to employment opportunities \nand fair treatment around access to employment and training for migrants and refugees.  \n \nEmployment brings many social, economic and health benefits to individuals, families and communities. \nConversely, unemployment brings an increased risk of depression, poor health, and social and \neconomic exclusion.  \n \nThis paper was inspired by ECCV’s Work Solutions Forum in May 2013 where participants shared their \nideas, expertise and experience around workforce participation for people from culturally diverse \nbackgrounds. It shows that the debate around employment challenges faced by migrants and refugees \nneeds to be reinvigorated and tackled from a fresh perspective – one that places greater emphasis on \npractical and positive solutions that make use of evidence-based findings and on-the-ground expertise.  \n \nContributors to this discussion paper, representing community organisations, governments, human \nrights groups and academics highlighted continual barriers faced by migrant job seekers in Victoria such \nas employer demands for local experience and lack of local networks that assist the process of finding a \njob. There was a reluctance of employers and professional organisations to recognise overseas \nqualifications, skills and experience. Limited English language proficiency was also a disadvantage. \nThere are deficiencies in employment services for migrants and refugees and the available employment \nguides are overwhelming to navigate. Funding cuts to the TAFE sector have had a negative impact on \neducation, training and employment pathways, particularly for young people from migrant and refugee \nbackgrounds. \n                                                     \n1 Australian Bureau of Statistics, Characteristics of Recent Migrants, Australia, Nov 2010.

That the Australian Government establishes an independent Office of the Fairness \nCommissioner similar to that in Canada to facilitate a fair and transparent appeals process that \nserves migrant skills and qualification recognition.  \n \n2. That a review of overseas qualifications and skills recognition processes be conducted at \nnational and state levels to ensure appropriate recognition processes by trade associations, \nprofessional bodies and employer organisations in a fair and transparent manner. \n \n3. That legislation is developed for the mandatory collection of cultural diversity data by federal, \nstate and local governments and private organisations to monitor and track inclusive, diversity \nemployment policies and practices. \n \n4. That an independent, professional research body similar to the former Bureau of Immigration, \nMulticultural and Population Research be established, in line with the recommendation of the \nHowe report Independent Inquiry into Insecure Work in Australia (2012). \n \n5. That the Australian Government conducts a review of the Job Services Australia (JSA) \nemployment services with a view to improve collaboration with ethnic and multicultural \norganisations, settlement service providers and employers to develop more sustainable \nemployment outcomes for disadvantaged job seekers from culturally and linguistically diverse \nbackgrounds. \n \n6. That the Australian Government develops a community-driven grants fund in close consultation \nwith relevant multicultural groups to address unemployment and under-employment of \ndisadvantaged migrants and refugees. \n \nVictorian State Government \n \nECCV recommends: \n \n7. That the Victorian Government establishes a Cultural Diversity in Employment Advisory Network \nwith representation from state and local governments, academia, Victoria’s multicultural sector, \nVEOHRC and VicHealth to promote the benefits of a culturally diverse workforce and to provide \nexpert advice to public sector, business community and employer organisations to assist them in \nbecoming more culturally diverse and inclusive. \n \n7 \n \n8. That the Victorian Government redirects allocations for reforms in the TAFE sector and Local \nLearning and Employment Networks (LLENs) programs to target disadvantaged young people \nfrom migrant and refugee backgrounds. \n \n9. That the Victorian Government forms a new Overseas Qualifications Assessment Board for the \nrecognition of overseas skills, qualifications and experience that functions to: \na. Secure proper assessment independent of profession and trades associations \nb. Provide training pathways for accreditation in line with Australian standards  \nc. Streamline fair and equitable assessment procedures \n \n10. That the Victorian Government establishes ‘one-stop shop’ information hubs in several locations \nin metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria to provide face-to-face information and advice \non overseas qualifications recognition for new migrants and refugees and accreditation \npathways that lead to further training and employment.  \n \n11. That the Victorian Government reintroduces and expands community-based employment \ninitiatives that work in partnerships with employers to provide job opportunities for  \ndisadvantaged migrant and refugee job seekers.  \n \n12. That the Victorian Government actively promotes and tailors existing language, literacy and \nnumeracy programs and education and training pathways to better meet the needs of people \nfrom culturally and linguistically  diverse backgrounds. \n \nLocal Government \n \nECCV recommends: \n \n13. That Victorian local government develops inclusive recruitment strategies and targets to \nincrease the employment of people from culturally diverse backgrounds to a minimum of at least \na third in each local council within the next 10 years to reflect the level of cultural diversity in the \nbroader population. \n   \n14. That the Victorian local government reallocates resources and grants to support community-\nbased networking initiatives for job seekers from new migrant and refugee backgrounds. \n \nCommunity-based Employment Initiatives \n \nECCV recommends: \n \n15. That VECCI works in partnership with multicultural peak organisations to develop effective work \nexperience and mentoring programs for new migrants and refugees, and more inclusive \nworkplaces. \n \n8 \n \n16. That all levels of government work in partnership with multicultural community organisations to \npromote resources for social enterprise initiatives that are targeted at new migrant and refugee \njob seekers. \n \n17. That media awareness campaigns be developed in partnership with VEOHRC, VicHealth and \nmulticultural peak organisations to improve inclusive and culturally diverse employment policies \nand practices. \n \nPOINTS FOR CONSIDERATION \n \nAction strategies for further consideration to improve cultural diversity in the workplace are as follows: \na) A public campaign is needed to promote the benefits of cultural diversity in the workplace and to \nraise awareness of discrimination in the realm of employment on cultural and racial grounds. \n \nb) In the interests of better business outcomes and meeting human rights and anti-discrimination \nobligations, the employee composition of organisations should be compatible with the nature of the \ncultural diversity of the communities and clients that they serve. This may be achieved by: \n Reviewing human resource policies, including recruitment policies and practices. \n Developing work experience and networking opportunities for new migrants. \n Establishing cultural diversity in employment networks. \n Developing cultural competence within workplaces. \n Ongoing data collection and research. \n \nc) Providing additional resources to foster the entrepreneurial talent of new migrants and refugees. \n \nd) Further reform is required in the employment services sector in order to better meet the needs of \ndisadvantaged migrant and refugee job seekers. \n \ne) National reform is required to ensure that overseas qualifications and skills are recognised by trade \nassociations, professional bodies and employer organisations in a fair and transparent manner. \n \nf) More needs to be done to address the educational and training needs of new migrants and \nrefugees with a particular focus on young people. \n  \n9 \n \n1.0 INTRODUCTION \n \nThis paper highlights a range of hidden and informal barriers to the recruitment and employment of \nculturally diverse people. The emphasis of this paper is derived from the in-depth insights as evidenced \nby the May 2013 ECCV forum and presents forward looking perspectives on multicultural employment \nin Victoria. The consultations, whilst informal and lacking a degree of academic rigor, consisted of \nbroad-based community engagement with over 100 participants at a ground-breaking Work Solutions \nforum5 in 2013 as well as expert multicultural input via the ECCV Employment Education and Training \nPolicy Committee. Participants included representatives from several universities, ethnic community \norganisations, multicultural organisations, local government, and generic community organisations with \nan interest in improving cultural diversity in the workforce.  \n \nThe scope of the paper includes a mapping and exploration of a wide range of issues that impact on \nunemployment and under-employment of migrants and refugees in Victoria. It provides a unique \noverview of the enormous complexity of relevant government policies and issues around migration and \njob creation. Whilst this paper has its limitations, as it cannot be considered a comprehensive literature \nreview, it provides an important impetus for further academic research.  \n \nThis discussion paper is divided into the following sections: \n Background \nThis section sets the scene by giving a snapshot of cultural diversity in Victoria, migrant labour force \nstatistics and the relationship between employment and wellbeing. Employment challenges for \nparticular groups of disadvantaged migrant job seekers and cultural diversity statistics in the Australian \npublic and private sectors are also examined. \n \n Policy Overview \nThis section gives an overview of relevant policies internationally, in particular in Canada, followed by a \nmapping of Australian and Victorian State Government and local government policies, programs and \nservices for new migrants and refugees in relation to employment, education and training.  \n \n Employment Barriers – Insights from Community Consultations \nThis section provides insights into the day-to-day difficulties experiences by migrants and refugees in \nfinding jobs. \n \n Solutions that Work \nThis section details some examples of community sector employment initiatives and partnerships. It \npresents key findings from multicultural community stakeholders on how to improve cultural diversity \nrecruitment strategies, issues relating to the recognition of overseas skills and qualifications and how to \ndevelop more inclusive workplaces. \n \n  \n                                                     \n5 Forum Work Solutions – Improving Cultural Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace – jointly conducted by ECCV, Darebin Ethnic Communities Council \nand Darebin City Council at Preston  on 21 May 2013 \n10 \n \n Resources for Employers \nPractical and comprehensive resources are provided in this section to assist employers improve the \ncultural responsiveness of their recruitment and employment practices. \n \n2.0 BACKGROUND \n \nSome of the key factors in achieving social cohesion and communal harmony are levels of \nunemployment and government responsiveness to issues of poverty and disadvantage according to the \nMapping Social Cohesion 2013: National Report (Scanlon Foundation).6  \n \nThis section summarises background, evidence-based research on various groups of Victorians and \nAustralians from migrant and refugee backgrounds regarding workforce participation challenges and \nemployment barriers. It shows that job seekers from culturally diverse backgrounds are particularly \nvulnerable to being trapped in insecure work.7 Additional challenges of specific groups such as \nrefugees, women, young people and international students from culturally diverse backgrounds are \nhighlighted as well as the lack of cultural diversity in some private and public sectors. The following \nissues are crucial as they point towards what needs to change. \n \nEmployment barriers \nThe unemployment rate of migrants is higher than that of the Australian born population. In Victoria, the \nunemployment rate of migrants is 8.7 per cent .8  \n \nVictoria’s population is among the fastest-growing and most diverse in Australia. At the 2011 Census, \nthe total population of Victoria was over 5 300 000 persons. Over a quarter (26 per cent) of Victorians \nwas born overseas in more than 200 countries and 47 per cent of Victorians were either born overseas \nor have at least one parent born overseas. Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of Victorians spoke a \nlanguage other than English at home.9 \n \nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics report Perspectives on Migrants (ABS 2011) states that the recent \nmigrant population had a higher rate of unemployment (8.5 per cent) than the Australian born \npopulation (4.6 per cent).10 It reports that 35 per cent of recent migrants, who arrived in Australia after \nthe year 2000, experienced some difficulty finding their first job in Australia. The most common \nchallenges experienced are: \n A lack of Australian work experience or references (64 per cent) \n Language difficulties (33 per cent) \n Lack of local contacts or networks (23 per cent) \n No jobs in their locality, line of work, or at all (15 per cent) \n                                                     \n6 Andrew Markus, 2013 p13 Mapping Social Cohesion: The Scanlon Foundation Surveys 2013 National Report (Caulfield, Monash University) \n7 Independent Inquiry into Insecure Work Australia.

The need to address employment barriers \nfacing recent migrants is not simply a question of economic productivity, however. Research points to \nthe link between employment and economic self-sufficiency and positive self-identity, financial \nindependence and a successful resettlement experience.12 Conversely, unemployment and joblessness \nincreases the risk of economic hardship, reduces social status and inhibits engagement in meaningful \nactivities.13 Further, people who are unemployed are more likely to experience depression and poor \nhealth, with the burden of unemployment more concentrated among particular population groups, such \nas recent migrants.14  \n \nThe changing patterns of work in Australia and increasing casual employment further disadvantage \nvulnerable groups such as women and youth from culturally diverse backgrounds as well as \ninternational students many of whom eventually become permanent residents.   \n \nChanging forms of work in Australia \nAustralia’s labour market has changed radically in recent decades. The predictability and security \nemployment once offered for immigrant families to re-build life no longer exists in the same way. The \nflexible workforce of today has resulted in increased job insecurity. The 2012 Independent Inquiry into \nInsecure Work identified that almost one quarter of all employees and one fifth of the total workforce are \nengaged in casual employment. Workers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are \nparticularly vulnerable to being trapped in insecure work.15  \n \nRefugees \nMigration has consistently contributed to Australia’s immediate and long term productive capacity16. In \nits submission to the Parliamentary Inquiry into Migration and Multiculturalism in Australia, the Victorian \nState Government acknowledged the significant contribution of skilled migrants to the economy by \ndiversifying the workforce, satisfying skill shortages, increasing demand for locally produced consumer \ngoods and encouraging international travel.17 The Inquiry noted that Humanitarian migrants’ contribution \nto productive capacity is more long term. Following what may be a heavy reliance on government \nsupport services initially, humanitarian migrants are more likely to show entrepreneurial and risk taking \nattributes regarding start-up businesses with many going on to establish successful business \nenterprises.18 \n                                                     \n11 ABS, Characteristics of Recent Migrants. \n12 Louise Kyle, et al., Refugees in the labour market: Looking for cost-effective models of assistance (Brotherhood of St Laurence, 2004), i. \nhttp://www.bsl.org.au/pdfs/refuges_in_labour_market.pdf in Ethnic Communities’ Council of Victoria, “Real Jobs: Employment for Migrants and Refugees in \nAustralia” (ECCV Policy Discussion Paper No. 3 2008, ECCV, 2008), 3. \n13 Rosalie McLachlan, Geoff Gilfillan, Jenny Gordon, Deep and Persistent Disadvantage in Australia, Australian Productivity Commission Staff Working \nPaper, (Canberra, 2013) 126. http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/124549/deep-persistent-disadvantage.pdf   \n14 Australian Bureau of Statistics, National Health Survey: Mental Health, Australia 2001.

Changes to the affordability and accessibility of education, employment and \nsettlement services present added challenges for women from culturally and linguistically diverse \nbackgrounds and makes them more vulnerable to social exclusion.19 \n \nMore generally, ECCV has previously highlighted employment issues affecting humanitarian migrant \nand refugee women including: the double discrimination effect of being a woman and a woman from a \nhumanitarian background; religious affiliation and dress; having a lower level of education than their \nmale counterparts; familial roles and responsibilities that discourage participation in the labour force; \nand limited access to childcare.20 \n \nYouth \nIn 2013, growing economic uncertainty coincided with an increase in unemployment and a marked \nincrease in reported experiences of discrimination according to the Mapping Social Cohesion 2013 \nNational Survey (Scanlon Foundation).21 \n \nABS figures show that Australia’s unemployment rate increased to a post-global financial crisis high of \n5.8 percent in August 201322, while youth unemployment (15-19 year-olds) increased to 17.3 per cent, \nits highest level since October 2010.23 Opportunities to find full-time work have decreased dramatically \nover the past 25 years meaning that increasing numbers of young people are more susceptible to long \nterm unemployment than the rest of the population and are more likely to be employed in casualised \nindustries.24 \n \nYoung people from recently arrived backgrounds and refugees are at greater risk of leaving education \nearlier than their local-born counterparts and therefore are represented more highly in the jobless rates. \nThere are many complex factors that contribute to educational disadvantage and unemployment. A \nyoung person’s still-developing English language skills can lead to communication challenges with other \nstudents and teachers. Some young people with a disrupted education pre arrival may experience \nadditional learning difficulties, for example being illiterate in their first language. Experiencing racism \nand discrimination at school adds further discouragement. Young people and their families from migrant \nand refugee backgrounds are often unfamiliar with the Australian education system. Further, inflexibility \nwithin the system, limited pathways from education to employment and sector funding cuts only serve to \nfurther discourage participation.25 \n \n                                                     \n19 Olga Bursian, “Employment: Issues for immigrant women and their families”, Australian Mosaic Issue 33, Autumn 2013: 37. \n20 Ethnic Communities’ Council of Victoria, ‘Restricted Access: Humanitarian migrant women and employment in Victoria’ (ECCV Policy Discussion Paper \nNo. 5. 2008) 8. \n21 Andrew Markus, Mapping Social Cohesion: The Scanlon Foundation Surveys 2013 National Report (Caulfield, Monash University, 2013), 1. \n22 Australian Bureau of Statistics, Labour Force, Australia Aug 2013, Cat.

The findings show that young entrepreneurs have a crucial role to play in tackling \nthe youth unemployment crisis and governments are increasingly looking for incentives to provide \nyoung people with the tools and support to start up new businesses to create jobs and economic \ngrowth. Suggestions for action include: expanding funding choices, increasing mentoring, harnessing \nthe power of diversity, changing society’s perceptions to be more tolerant of failure, targeted ‘speed up’ \nincentives and reducing red tape and excessive taxation for new businesses. \n \nInternational students \nIn general international students studying at tertiary level are permitted to work subject to the conditions \nset out in the particular subclass of their Student Visa. This is usually limited to a maximum of 40 hours \nper fortnight while their course is in session and unlimited hours during course breaks27. International \nstudents with limited English and little or no work experience are particularly vulnerable to exploitation in \nforms of insecure work.28 The pressure of living costs leads many students to work additional hours for \ncash-in-hand wages and accept employment conditions that are poor and sometimes unsafe. \n \nFollowing graduation, international citizens who remain in Australia on a Temporary Visa 485 with the \nview to gaining Permanent Residency (PR) can find it difficult to establish networks, access work \nexperience and find employment commensurate with their qualifications. \n \nUnder-representation of migrants in the public sector \nUnderrepresentation of migrant workers in the public sector has impacts on the quality and efficiency of \npublic service, access and equity, equitable participation in government policy development and social \ncohesion.29 Based on 2006 Census data, 11.34 per cent of Australian Public Sector employees were of \nnon-English speaking background (NESB) compared to 14.42 per cent in the broader workforce.30 The \nfederal public sector has the same proportion of employees from a non-English speaking background \nas in the general workforce (approximately 14 per cent). The Victorian State and Local Governments \npublic service however, falls significantly short of this mark with 10.6 per cent and 7.6 per cent \nrespectively.31  \n \nCultural diversity employment in the private sector  \nWhile data on culturally diverse employment in the private sector is limited, a recent Australian-first \nstudy by the Diversity Council of Australia (DCA) and Price Water House (PWH), Capitalising on \nCulture, a National survey of Australian Business Leaders (DCA October 2013) revealed the cultural \norigins of board members and senior executives in Australia’s top 200 publicly listed companies.32 \n                                                     \n26 Ernst and Young June 2013, Avoiding a Lost Generation – young entrepreneurs identify five imperatives for action, produced for the G20 Young \nEntrepreneurs Alliance Summit Russia.  \n27 Department of Immigration and Citizenship, Fact Sheet: Permission to Work Arrangement for Student Visa Holders (Canberra: Australian Government, \nMarch 2012) http://www.immi.gov.au/students/_pdf/permission-to-work-students.pdf \n28 Independent Inquiry into Insecure Work, Lives on Hold, 72. \n29 Bertone et al, 2011 Employment Barriers, 3. \n30 Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006 Census of Population and Housing.

Key findings showed that 22.2 per cent of directors are ‘culturally diverse’ (referring to \npeople from non-Anglo-Celtic cultural origins such as European, Asian, African, Middle Eastern and \nPacific Islander origins), 21.9 per cent of CEOs, 19.9 per cent of senior executives and 13.5 per cent of \nchairs. This compares to 32.2 per cent in the general Australian community33. \n \nAccording to the DCA cultural diversity represents an untapped potential for the workforce as it provides \nbusinesses with vital language skills; overseas business networks, cultural knowledge and insights into \ndiverse consumer preferences.34 \n  \nFrom the research, DCA makes a series of eleven checklist recommendations to assist organisations to \ncapitalise on cultural diversity in employment such as: \n Ensure that perceptions of the concept of ‘cultural fit’ are not being used to filter out  culturally \ndiverse candidates \n Recognise and value the cultural intelligence or cultural quotient (CQ) in an organisation that is \nthe ability employees’ ability to adapt as they interact with people from different cultural \nbackgrounds to their own \n Adopt an inclusive rather than an assimilatory or colour blind approach to managing workforce \ndiversity as assimilatory approaches are associated with poorer team performance and greater \nracial bias35. \n \n3.0 POLICY OVERVIEW \n \n3.1 International \nTo give a wider perspective on the issues facing culturally diverse job seekers in Australia, this section \nhighlights three aspects of international policy and practice using Canada as an example. This is a  \nuseful exercise given similarities between Australia and Canada in terms of overall numbers of \nmigrants, population distribution, geographical size, standard of living and style of government.36,37 \n \nFairness Commissioners, Canada \nLike Australia, Canada has experienced an increase in skilled migrants who have studied abroad and \nare seeking registration to practice in their new country. In Australia there is no direct appeal or \ncomplaints process for individuals to question decisions made by the diverse and fragmented range of \nprofessional and trades bodies regarding the assessment of overseas qualifications and skills.

The Office of the Fairness Commissioner was established to hold regulators accountable \nfor meeting requirements set out in the legislation. Significantly, the Office recognises that \ninternationally trained professionals bring “new ideas and innovation, global experience and networks, \nand linguistic and cultural competencies that enhance their ability to serve the increasingly diverse \npopulation of Ontario.”38 \n \nImmigrant Access Fund \nThe Immigrant Access Fund (IAF) Loan Program is a microfinance scheme set up in 2005 to assist \nskilled migrants get back into their field of work following settlement in Canada. Loans of up to $10 000 \nare provided to cover costs such as training, professional fees, exam expenses, assessment, books \nand childcare. The Loan Program is not limited to particular occupations but is open to migrants of any \nprofession or trade. “IAF invests in people who the banks would turn away – people who have skills and \nabilities our society needs….We lend to people not based on where they are today, but where we \nbelieve they will be in the future”.39 \n \nWelcome to Canada Guide \nWelcome to Canada – What you should know is considered to be the official handbook for new \nmigrants to the country.

For \nmigrants, limited English ability can be a significant barrier to finding employment relevant to their \nskills.42  \n \nData taken from the report How Australia is Faring (2010), published by the Australian Government \nSocial Inclusion Board indicated that the employment rate for people aged 15 to 64 years varied \nsignificantly according to their level of English proficiency:  \n 36 per cent of people who did not speak English well or at all were employed; \n 65 per cent of people who spoke another language but also spoke English very well or well were \nemployed; and \n 73 per cent of people who only spoke English were employed.43 \n \nThe Australian Federal Government provides English language tuition for migrants and refugees \nthrough the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP). \n \nAMEP is described as the Australian Government’s largest settlement program, reflecting the position \nthat gaining proficiency in English is a key to successfully settling in Australia.44 Eligibility for AMEP is \ncomplex, but in general is available free to eligible migrants who do not have functional English, \nwhether from the humanitarian, family or skilled visa streams. AMEP clients have voluntary access to \n510 hours of English Language courses in the first five years of settlement. ECCV community feedback \nindicates that for many new arrivals 510 hours of English tuition is insufficient to prepare them for \neffective workforce participation. Some migrants with complex needs, however may be eligible to \naccess additional hours of tuition through the Special Preparatory Program (SPP) classes.45  \n \nQuestions have been raised about the effectiveness of AMEP with reports that many job seekers from \nculturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds complete AMEP without being able to effectively read, \nwrite or speak English. 46,47  \n \nJob seeker support \nIn addition to the fundamental importance of being able to communicate in English there is increasing \nrecognition that additional language support is needed for job seekers using the services of Job \nServices Australia (JSA) who are looking for work in particular professions. \n \nCompetency in English language alone is usually not sufficient to gain employment. Support is needed \nto help job seekers gain local work experience, knowledge of Australian work place culture and the \n                                                     \n42 2013Joint Standing Commission on Migration, Inquiry into Migration and Multiculturalism,194. \n43 Australian Social Inclusion Board, Social Inclusion in Australia: How Australia is faring.

A number of government initiatives \nexist to support job seekers such as and the Seeking Education and Employment (SEE) and Workplace \nEnglish Language and Literacy (WELL) programs, however there is limited evidence of how widely \npromoted those programs have been and to what extend employers take them up.  \n \nThe SEE program, administered by the Department of Industry, Innovation, climate Change, Science, \nResearch and Tertiary Education (DIICSRTE), provides assistance to job seekers experiencing \nsignificant disadvantage in the labour market due to low levels of language, literacy and/or numeracy. \nOnce in employment the WELL program gives tailored assistance to organisations for provide job-\nrelated workplace training in English language, literacy and numeracy skills. Whilst approximately 27 \nper cent of WELL participants are from non-English speaking backgrounds48,49  further research is \nrequired to establish how effectively those training programs are embedded in the mindset of \nemployers. \n \nRecognition of overseas skills and qualifications \nAustralia does not have a single, unified authority that assesses and recognises overseas qualifications. \nNavigating the system is complex and difficult for anyone, let alone a recently arrived migrant. What \nappears to be a rigorous system is often fraught with frustration for the newly arrived migrant. Having \nalready undergone a pre-migration assessment, migrants may face a lengthy and costly process to \nhave these attributes recognised for employment once in Australia. In effect their pre-migration \nassessment often becomes invalid and ignored, or irrelevant.  \n \nMany migrants seeking recognition of their work-related skills, experience and qualifications perceive \nexcessive duplication in the assessment process from their overseas migration application through to \nfinding a job in Australia. Recognition pathways include authorities such as: \n Overseas immigration authorities \n Local Australian trades committees \n Professional and trades bodies that vary within each State \n Local employers who make decisions about appropriate qualifications with or without advice \nfrom relevant trades and business authorities such as the Victorian Employers' Chamber of \nCommerce and Industry (VECCI) and other relevant authorities.  \n \nOnce in Australia, the qualifications recognition process commonly starts with translation of documents \nfollowed by an assessment of the educational level of an overseas professional qualification by the \nNational Office of Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR), then further assessment is required by the \nrelevant industry associations. In fact, depending on the profession, registration and membership in the \nrelevant professional association may be required before employment can be sought. If further study is \nrequired, Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) may be involved with recognition of prior learning \nand determining what gaps exist in a person’s knowledge. For migrants and refugees with a trade, state \ntraining tribunals or Trades Recognition Australia need to be engaged to assess and recognise \noverseas skills. For trades that require a license, a provisional license needs to be obtained from the \n                                                     \n48 Department of Immigration and Border Protection, Fact Sheet 94 \n49 Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. “WELL: Benefits to Business”, (Australian Government) DVD recording. \n18 \n \nrelevant State or Territory licensing regulator. A general license may be obtained after Australian \ncontent training and a period of supervised employment.50   \n \nAn Assessment Subsidy for Overseas Trained Professionals program (ASDOT) to help skilled \noverseas-trained professionals with the cost of assessments and exams to practice in Australia is \nlimited to a few health and medical professions for example a dentist, general medical practitioner, \nnurse, optometrist and pharmacist.51 \n \nA process exists in the Australian Government for continuous improvement especially regarding the \nstreamlining of processes for overseas skills recognition for migrants. The former Department of \nImmigration and Citizenship implemented a number of procedural reforms around skill awareness and \nacceptance of overseas qualifications in the workplace52, following the Joint Standing Committee on \nMigration Review in 2006 on overseas skills recognition of migrants in Australia53. The most recent ABS \nstatistics (2010) show that while 65 per cent of all recent migrants had obtained a non-school \nqualification prior to arriving in Australia only 51 per cent of these migrants had used their highest non-\nschool qualification in their first job in Australia.54 This suggests that in order to address the issue of \nunder-employment among migrants, further streamlining and facilitating of the current recognition \nsystem is required. Furthermore, Australia lacks an independent authority where skilled migrants are \nable to make appeals regarding the fairness, transparency and impartiality of the overseas qualification \nrecognition process.  \n \n \nRecommendation 2 \nThat a review of overseas qualifications and skills recognition processes be conducted at national and \nstate levels to ensure appropriate recognition processes by trade associations, professional bodies and \nemployer organisations in a fair and transparent manner. \n \n \nData collection and research \nTimes are changing as data collection in the workplace becomes more common place, for example in \n2012 new Australian Government legislation, the Workplace Gender Equality Act introduced reporting \nrequirements on gender and employment composition.55 There is no formal requirement, however, for \nworkplaces to collect data on their cultural diversity (for instance an employee’s language, ethnicity and \nnational origin). Mandatory data collection of the composition of culturally diverse employees would \nenable organisations to make informed policy decisions on how to improve cultural diversity in the \nworkplace that respond to both employer and employee needs. A lack of facts also serves to perpetuate \n                                                     \n50 “Qualification and Skills Recognition”, Australian Government, Canberra, 2013, http://australia.gov.au/topics/education-and-training/qualifications-and-\nskills-recognition  \n51 Department of Human Services, “Assessment Subsidy for Overseas Trained Professionals”, (Canberra: Australian Government, 2013) \nhttp://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/assessment-subsidy-for-overseas-trained-professionals  \n52 Joint Standing Committee on Migration.

In line with \none of the recommendations of the 2012 Howe report Inquiry into Insecure Work, an effective way of \nachieving this would be through the establishment of an independent, professional research body \nsimilar to the former Bureau of Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research.56 \n \n \nRecommendation 3 \nThat legislation is developed for the mandatory collection of cultural diversity data by federal, state and \nlocal governments and private organisations; to monitor and track inclusive, diversity employment \npolicies and practices.  \n \n \n \nRecommendation 4 \nThat an independent, professional research body similar to the former Bureau of Immigration, \nMulticultural and Population Research be established, in line with the recommendation of the Howe \nreport Independent Inquiry into Insecure Work in Australia (2012). \n \n \nEmployment Services and Programs \nRefugee and humanitarian migrants have access to a range of employment services offered by \nCentrelink and Job Services Australia (JSA).  Many disadvantaged job seekers from culturally and \nlinguistically diverse backgrounds utilise specific services to help them find and keep a job57. Centrelink \nalso provides a range of free services to newly arrived migrants and refugees such as interpreters, a \ntranslation service and a multilingual phone service.58 The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) \nprovides accredited small business training, business advice and mentoring for eligible job seekers as \nwell as income support for up to 52 weeks.59   \n \nDespite a Federal Government review of service delivery in 2009 that resulted in positive reform, a \nFederation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia (FECCA) employment strategy paper based on \ncommunity consultations has indicated that the current JSA model is not sufficiently effective in \n                                                     \n56 Independent Inquiry into Insecure Work, Lives on Hold, 72. \n57 Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, “Job Services Australia” Australian Government, 2013, http://deewr.gov.au/how-job-\nservices-australia-can-help-job-seekers  \n58 “Multi-lingual Phone Service”, Department of Human Services, Australian Government, August 2013. \nhttp://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/centrelink/multilingual-phone-service \n59 Joint Standing Committee, Inquiry into Migration and Multiculturalism, 196. \n20 \n \nproviding the most disadvantaged job seekers, in particular recently arrived humanitarian program \nmigrants and refugees, with the support they require.60 Issues include: a focus on compliance to \ngovernment policy rather than service delivery; not effectively taking into account individual \ncircumstances that affect the job seeking process; flawed use of the Job Seeker Classification \nInstrument (JSCI) tool to measure the relative disadvantage of job seekers; limited cultural \nresponsiveness among some JSA staff; and lack of information flow between JSA providers and other \ngroups supporting recent migrants and refugees such as settlement service providers.61 \n \nOrganisationally and as service providers, some JSAs have low levels of cultural competency and lack \nthe policies, tools, procedures and resources to effectively deal with the complex issues that \ndisadvantaged job seekers from migrant and refugee backgrounds present.62 \n \nA positive step toward further reform in the employment services sector was made at an Australian \nGovernment Best Practice Forum in 2012, where ECCV was represented in collaboration with the \nDepartment of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) and the Melbourne \nEmployment Forum. \n \n \nRecommendation 5 \nThat the Australian Government conducts a review of the Job Services Australia (JSA) employment \nservices with a view to improve collaboration with ethnic and multicultural organisations, settlement \nservice providers and employers to develop more sustainable employment outcomes for disadvantaged \njob seekers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. \n \n \nMigrant Communities Employment Fund \nIn 2013 the Australian government worked in close collaboration with the multicultural sector in Victoria \nto develop the Migrant Communities Employment Fund (MCEF), an innovative community-based \ninitiative to fill gaps in employment service delivery to migrants and refugees in a targeted and culturally \ncompetent manner. The MCEF was designed to provide better engagement with employers and \nimprove employer perceptions of migrant and refugee job seekers and workers.63  \n \nIn December 2013 the Federal Coalition Government decided not to proceed with the MCEF and \nredirected the allocated $6.6 million (over two years)64 without any replacement program to address \nhigher levels of unemployment among recent migrants.  \n \nMCEF was an innovative community-driven program that aimed to: \n Improve employment outcomes for refugee and migrant job seekers; \n                                                     \n60 Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia New and Emerging Communities Policy Committee 2011, Employment Strategy Paper. \nSubmission to the Member for Melbourne, FECCA 2011, 3. \n61 FECCA, Employment Strategy Paper. \n62 FECCA, Employment Strategy Paper. \n63 “Applications open for migrant employment program”, Senator Kate Lundy, July 2013.  http://www.katelundy.com.au/2013/07/05/applications-open-for-\nmigrant-employment-program/  \n64 Australian Government, Department of Employment Migrant Communities employment fund website at  http://employment.gov.au/migrant-communities-\nemployment-fund accessed on 18 February 2014 \n21 \n \n Increase the capacity of employers to employ refugee and migrant workers; \n Improve understanding of how to best support migrant and refugee job seekers and their \nemployers; and \n Provide models that could be replicated to other locations and groups of migrants and \nrefugees.65 \n \nThe MCEF was designed to provide opportunities for migrants and refugees to access suitable training \n(including English language training) and mentoring support; improve participation in work experience \nand training in Australian workplace culture; give better access to employment opportunities; and \nprovide employment support and post placement support.

These resources set out and describe the steps involved in finding work in \nAustralia, for example arranging for qualification documents to be translated, getting skills and \nqualifications recognised and obtaining Australian work experience. \n \nWhen compared with the Canadian guide Welcome to Canada – What you should know (see \nInternational section above) the Australian Beginning a life guide is less welcoming to the reader and \ncomes across as a lengthy fact sheet. However to its credit, the Australian guide is available in 37 \ndifferent languages whereas the Canadian Guide is available in just two.  \n \nThe Guide for Employment for Migrants (DEEWR 2013) is a comprehensive and precise resource that \ncovers every aspect of finding work in Australia. The guide’s limitations are that the amount of \ninformation is overwhelming if presented solely in its written form. There is also an assimilatory tone in \nthe Getting Help section, when discussing the importance of language, literacy and numeracy skills, as \n“a heavy accent that is difficult to understand can actually be a liability and may hold you back.” 67 That \nmay have a discouraging, possibly unintended effect, of tempering the aspirations of the migrant or \nrefugee job seekers.  \n \n                                                     \n65 Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, “Migrant Communities Employment Fund” (Canberra: Australian Government, July \n2013) https://deewr.gov.au/migrant-communities-employment-fund   \n66 DEEWR, “Migrant Communities Employment Fund”. \n67 Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, Hills-Holroyd Paramatta Migrant Resource Centre, Guide to Employment for Migrants. \n(Canberra: Australian Government, February 2013), http://www.training.nsw.gov.au/skills_trade_recognition/employment/index.html, 26. \n22 \n \n3.3 State \nEducation, training and employment options for young people \nIn the State of Victoria there is limited information available on the extent to which Technical and \nFurther Education (TAFE) institutions adequately target disadvantaged young people from culturally \ndiverse backgrounds.

Ideally education also creates greater labour market resilience within individuals.68   \n \nThe following TAFE and Local Learning and Employment Networks (LLENs) programs are pivotal in \nproviding appropriate education, training and employment options for young people from migrant and \nrefugee backgrounds.  \n \nTAFEs work with schools to support better outcomes for students, and with local communities to \ndevelop programs and support for students from disadvantaged and culturally and linguistically diverse \nbackgrounds. They aim to provide pathways to higher education and to the professions, and in doing \nso, aim to support Australia’s need for a highly educated workforce and social mobility. The LLENs \nprograms are designed to improve education, training and employment options for young people from \n10-19 years particularly those at risk of making poor transitions from compulsory schooling to the next \nstage of their lives and careers.69 \n \nFunding cuts to the TAFE sector imposed by the State Government in 2012 have resulted in course \ncuts, campus mergers and closures, with consequent impact on people from culturally and linguistically \ndiverse backgrounds.70 In its report Training Days (2013) the independent think tank Per Capita \ncriticises the cuts stating that they “undermine TAFE’s ability to deliver their statutory community service \nobligations which assist disadvantaged and disabled students”.71 \n \n \nRecommendation 7 \nThat the Victorian Government establishes a Cultural Diversity in Employment Advisory Network with \nrepresentation from state and local governments, academia, Victoria’s multicultural sector, VEOHRC \nand VicHealth to promote the benefits of a culturally diverse workforce and to provide expert advice to \npublic sector, business community and employer organisations to assist them in becoming more \nculturally diverse and inclusive. \n \n  \n                                                     \n68 McLachlan, Gilfillan and Gordon, 2013 Deep and Persistent Disadvantage, 109.

Models of Vocational Training Provision: Lessons from the Victorian Experience. (Per Capita, July \n2013), 3. http://www.percapita.org.au  \n23 \n \n \nRecommendation 8 \nThat the Victorian Government redirects allocations for reforms in the TAFE sector and Local Learning \nand Employment Networks (LLENs) programs to target disadvantaged young people from migrant and \nrefugee backgrounds. \n \n \nOverseas Qualifications Unit \nA Victorian State Government body, the Overseas Qualifications Unit (OQU), has been established to \nprovide qualified professionals who are living permanently in Victoria with an assessment of their \noverseas qualification to assist them to undertake work in Victoria. The OQU provides an on-line service \nto assist employers, educational institutions and others to appropriately interpret overseas education \nand qualifications.72 ECCV community feedback indicates that some job seekers from culturally diverse \nbackgrounds are overwhelmed by the complexity of the system and would benefit from additional face-\nto-face support. Research indicates that the process for gaining full recognition of foreign qualifications \nis cumbersome.73 \n \n \nRecommendation 9 \nThat the Victorian Government forms a new Overseas Qualifications Assessment Board for the \nrecognition of overseas skills, qualifications and experience that functions to: \na) Secure proper assessment independent of profession and trades associations \nb) Provide training pathways for accreditation in line with Australian standards  \nc) Streamline fair and equitable assessment procedures \n \n \n \nRecommendation 10 \nThat the Victorian Government establishes ‘one-stop shop’ information hubs in several locations in \nmetropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria to provide face-to-face information and advice on \noverseas qualifications recognition for new migrants and refugees and accreditation pathways that lead \nto further training and employment.  \n \n \nCommunity partnership employment programs \nIn the past decade, a Victorian State Government employment programs such as the Workforce \nParticipation Partnerships (WPP) program have not been renewed or replaced. The WPP was a \nsuccessful program in terms of concrete employment outcomes for migrant and refugee communities, \nas well as other disadvantaged job seekers.  Between 2005 and 2008 the WPP program funded 98 \nprojects to assist over 2,040 job seekers across Victoria secure ongoing employment. The funding of \nmigrant resource centres and ethno-specific organisations to deliver tailored employment services to \n                                                     \n72 State Government of Victoria, “The Overseas Qualifications Unit”, (State Government of Victoria: October 2013) \nhttp://www.liveinvictoria.vic.gov.au/employing-overseas-talent/settle-and-retain-new-workers/the-overseas-qualifications-unit  \n73 Hawthorne, Lesleyanne 2011 Competing for skills: Migration an Trends in New Zealand and Australian, Department of Labour, Australia \n24 \n \nmigrants and refugees was a promising aspect of this program. For example, the New Hope Foundation \nassisted dozens of young men from African backgrounds to secure employment in the meat industry in \nthe regional area of Castlemaine. Additionally, Victorian Arabic Social Services assisted over 160 young \npeople from Arabic speaking backgrounds develop employment skills and enter the labour market.74 \nProgram funding ceased in late 2008. \n \nCurrently there are several generic employment initiatives coordinated by the Department of State \nDevelopment, Business and Innovation. They include: Business in Transition Support, an information \nand referral service that supports employers and employees through the process of retrenchment; the \nYouth Employment Scheme (YES) Trainee Scheme which gives recent school leavers on-the-job skills \nand work experience with the state public service; and Employment Start Up for Business support which \nencourages businesses that are experiencing difficulties filling roles to employ young people supported \nwith a traineeship.75 While each of these programs may be accessed by eligible migrant workers and \njob seekers, they are not targeted at or tailored to the needs of new and emerging migrant communities. \n \n \nRecommendation 11 \nThat the Victorian Government reintroduces and expands community-based employment initiatives that \nwork in partnerships with employers to provide job opportunities for  disadvantaged migrant and refugee \njob seekers.  \n \n \n \nRecommendation 12 \nThat the Victorian Government actively promotes and tailors existing language, literacy and numeracy \nprograms and education and training pathways to better meet the needs of people from culturally and \nlinguistically  diverse backgrounds. \n \n \n3.4 Local Government \nHidden Barriers \nEmployment in local government in the Melbourne Metropolitan Area does not reflect the community it \nserves according to the Swinburne University report Employment Barriers and Success Factors for \nSkilled Immigrants in the Melbourne Public Sector (Bertone et al 2011).76 Findings show that a range of \nhidden, informal barriers limit the recruitment and employment of skilled migrants, and especially recent \nmigrants, in the Melbourne public sector, despite positive Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) \nlegislation and diversity principles. \n \n                                                     \n74 Ethnic Communities’ Council of Victoria, “ECCV 2008-09 State Budget Submission: Maintaining a Multicultural Victoria,” (ECCV: 2008) 4. \nhttp://eccv.org.au/doc/ECCV200809StateBudgetSubmissionfinal.pdf \n75  Business Victoria, “Business in Transition Support”, (State Government of Victoria, June, 2013). http://www.business.vic.gov.au/operating-a-\nbusiness/employing-and-managing-people/ending-employment/business-in-transition-support; Department of State Development, Business and Innovation, \n“Youth Employment Scheme”, (State Government of Victoria, July 2013) http://www.dsdbi.vic.gov.au/employment-with-us/employment-programs/youth-\nemployment-scheme; Business Victoria, “Employment Start Up for Business”, (State Government of Victoria, August 2013) \nhttp://www.business.vic.gov.au/grants-and-assistance/employment-start-up-for-business  \n76 Bertone et al 2011,Employment Barriers and Success Factors for Skilled Immigrants in the Melbourne public sector, Swinburne University \n25 \n \nRecruitment drive \nAccording to Bertone’s report positive factors that helped migrants gain public sector employment \nincluded mentoring programs, work experience, short term contracts, revised recruitment rules, and \ntemporary visas where the employer sponsors the immigrant. The research proposed mandatory \nworkforce data collecting on cultural diversity to assist organisations track and improve the cultural \ndiversity profile of their staff. The study indicated that, in light of looming skill shortages and the known \nbenefits of cultural diversity in the workforce, a concerted policy and practice drive is needed at the local \ngovernment level to overcome employment barriers faced by job seekers from culturally diverse \nbackgrounds.  \n \nSummary \nSo far, this section of the discussion paper has provided a policy overview of international legislation as \nwell as federal and Victorian employment policies and programs for people from migrant and refugee \nbackgrounds.  \n \nThe next section provides insights into the impact of unemployment and under-employment on \nVictorians from culturally diverse backgrounds. They include the findings of extensive community \nconsultations. \n \n4.0 EMPLOYMENT BARRIERS - INSIGHTS FROM COMMUNITY CONSULTATIONS \n \nOn 21 May 2013, ECCV held its forum Work Solutions:  Cultural Diversity and Inclusion in the \nWorkplace at the Preston City Hall, in partnership with Darebin Ethnic Communities Council and the \nDarebin City Council. Almost 100 people attended representing multicultural organisations, ethnic \ncommunities, sports clubs, local councils, the health sector, emergency services, educational \ninstitutions and private employers. They identified important issues around the unemployment and \nunder-employment of Victorians from culturally diverse backgrounds.  \n \nThe following is a summary of the key barriers identified by forum participants regarding employment \nchallenges experienced by migrants and refugees. \n \n4.1  Non-recognition of overseas qualifications and skills \nEmployers are reluctant to recognise the range of skills and global outlook that people from culturally \ndiverse backgrounds bring to the workplace. Overseas qualifications, skills and experience are often not \nadequately recognised resulting in under-employment. \n \nMany migrants and refugees find the system for recognition of overseas skills and qualifications too \ncomplex to navigate without face-to-face support resulting in unemployment and under-employment. \nWhat appears to be a rigorous assessment system, in practice is more of a disabling system that \ndashes the hopes and aspirations of migrants and refugees with overseas qualification who seek \nproductive employment in Australia. \n \n26 \n \n4.2  Lack of culturally inclusive training programs  \nThere is a lack of culturally inclusive programs for both job seekers and employees. More targeted \nprograms in mentoring, coaching, induction or counselling are needed to improve employment \noutcomes for people form culturally diverse backgrounds. \n \n4.3  Cultural competence for employers \nThere is a general lack of awareness of the benefits of cultural diversity in the workplace and \ninadequate training and education programs to improve the cultural competence of employers and \nemployees.   \n \n4.4  Unconscious bias in recruitment  \nCurrent recruitment processes can be ineffective for people from culturally diverse backgrounds. \nWorkplace HR (Human Resources) practice is often discriminatory as unconscious bias places too \nmuch emphasis on merit-based selection and inconsistent use of selection criteria. Staff responsible for \nrecruitment is often unaware of their personal bias and the benefits of a culturally diverse workforce. \n \nIn relation to organisational human resources and recruitment policies, community participants raised \nthe following as issues of concern that disadvantage culturally diverse job seekers: \n Job descriptions are often more complex than they need to be. \n Use of key selection criteria as a recruitment tool is over emphasised. \n Staff responsible for recruitment often prefers applicants with a similar background to \nthemselves, undervaluing overseas experience, skills and qualifications. \n There is an over-emphasis on written English skills that excludes otherwise suitable candidates. \n Workplace induction programs need to be more inclusive – for example by explaining work \nplace norms, the importance of safety, encouraging open communication among colleagues \nand acknowledging the value of global experience and perspectives. \n \n4.5  Over-focus on English language \nVarying levels of English language competence present a barrier to employment and diminished \nopportunities within a workplace; for example an employee with a lower level of English language ability \nmay be misunderstood by assimilatory attitudes of colleagues or be overlooked for promotional and \nother work related opportunities. \n \n4.6  Lack of data and research \nMandatory data collection and reporting on workplace diversity is needed to help drive change in \nemployee demographics. Similarly, more research is needed in order to dispel myths and present a \nbusiness case to employers for a culturally diverse and inclusive workplace. \n \n4.7  Discrimination \nDespite anti-discrimination legislation, racial discrimination still exists in the workplace and in \nemployment practices as a significant human rights issue.  Education and engagement at a community \nlevel is needed to help stop such discrimination and improve inter-cultural understanding. \n27 \n \n \nThese barriers must be addressed to ensure a fair and equitable access to jobs and training. The \nfollowing section provides examples of positive diversity-focused employment initiatives and inclusive \nworkplace practices. \n \n5.0 SOLUTIONS THAT WORK  \n \nThe following section includes examples of work solutions with positive employment outcomes for \npeople from culturally diverse backgrounds. They include recent studies and initiatives that have made \na positive contribution to inclusive and diverse workplaces such as distinguishing between cultural \ndiversity and genuinely inclusive practices in the workplace; local government recruitment initiatives; \npractical resource guides and kits for employers; examples of mentoring programs; suggestions for \nimproving networking for disadvantaged job seekers; and the growing potential of social enterprise \ninitiatives for migrants and refugees. \n \n5.1 Community partnerships \nMany not-for-profit charitable and community organisations work with and run employment programs for \ndisadvantaged migrants and refugee job seekers. They are beneficial in that they develop partnerships \nwith employers. Strengthening partnership with employers is pivotal for successful community-based \nemployment projects that provide employment for culturally diverse job seekers. Two examples are \ngiven below.  \n \nGiven the Chance  \nThe Brotherhood of St Laurence’s Given the Chance program links refugees in Victoria with mentors \nfrom business, community and government and also offers work experience opportunities and job \nseeking training specific to the individual. More than two-thirds of participants go on to find employment \nor undertake study to improve their chances of finding work. In 2013 Given the Chance developed \nextensive partnerships with major local employers in finance, health, entertainment and domestic \nservices.77 Given the Chance also offers a training resource for employers employing refugees called \nBuilding Bridges.78 \n \n5.2  Place-based approach \nVictorian Co-operative on Children’s Services for Ethnic Groups (VICSEG) New Futures \nVICSEG New Futures is a non-government community organisation that provides support and training \nto newly arrived and recently settled migrant communities in northern and western metropolitan \nMelbourne. \n \nThe New Opportunities in Family Day Care project involves the delivery of Certificate III in Children’s \nServices as well as an eight-week (35-hour) orientation to becoming a family day care educator. \nParticipants receive customised tuition such as bilingual language support to ensure conceptual \nunderstanding and competence, work placement support, mentoring and assessment.  \n                                                     \n77 “Given the Chance”, Brotherhood of St Laurence, 2010. http://www.bsl.org.au/Services/Refugees-and-migrants/Given-the-Chance  \n78 “Building Bridges”, Brotherhood of St Laurence, 2010. http://www.bsl.org.au/Services/Refugees-and-settlement/Building-Bridges  \n28 \n \n \nTheir Project has forged valuable partnerships with the Brotherhood of St Laurence and local councils, \nwith benefits such as curriculum enhancement and customisation, professional development \nopportunities and employment creation. \n \nIn 2012 VICSEG developed New Futures Family Day Care, a culturally-responsive, place-based cluster \nmodel provided by qualified and experienced bilingual educators.79  Research indicates that a place-\nbased approach improves people’s wellbeing by creating connected and engaged communities to \naddress multiple issues such as poor housing, social isolation and fragmented services at the local \nneighbourhood level80.  \n \nThe following case story exemplifies how the place-based programs offered by VICSEG New Futures \naddressed multiple and complex issues of a female jobseeker from a culturally diverse background and \nsupported her to successfully find employment. \n \nTable 1 Case study about multicultural community sector employment support \n \n                                                     \n79 ECCV interview July 2013, Victorian Cooperative on Children’s Services for Ethnic Groups (VICSEG) New Futures; http://www.vicseg.com.au  \n80 Policy Brief Issue 23, 2011 Place-based approaches to supporting children and families, an initiative of the Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne Centre \nfor community Child Health. \n \nSUCCESS - ONE JOB SEEKER’S STORY \nSamira migrated to Australia from Lebanon to get married in 2005. She arrived with little knowledge \nof the culture and did not speak English. \nBefore leaving her home country, Samira completed first-year university studies in biology and \nworked part-time at a hospital. The unexpected death of her father meant she was unable to \ncomplete university but she continued working at the hospital for the next three years – in reception, \nmedical records and accounts. “I am a quick learner so my boss moved me around”, she says. \nSamira recalls her initial settlement experience as challenging – she felt as though she’d landed on \na different planet. Learning English through Australian Migrant English Program (AMEP) at NMIT \nhelped though, as it enabled her to grasp the language of her adopted country and make new \nfriends. \nFollowing the birth of her son, Samira attended a local playgroup for migrant and refugee women \nand it was here that she learnt about the Certificate III in Children’s Services offered by VICSEG, a \nnot-for-profit organisation that provides learning and employment opportunities for new migrants \nand refugees. \nSamira commenced the Certificate III six months after the birth of her second child. Access to \noccasional childcare offered by VICSEG was an important factor in her enabling her to commit to \nand complete the qualification. In a similar vein, Samira then completed VICSEG’s New \nOpportunities in Family Day Care orientation program, which gave her the skills, knowledge and \nsupport to become a family day care educator and run a business in her own home. \n29 \n \n \n \n5.3 Diversity + inclusion \nInclusive workplace practices are the key ingredient to improving workplace diversity and business \nperformance in Australia according to the recent report Waiter, is that Inclusion in my soup? of the \nVictorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission (VEOHRC 2012).  Significantly, the \nfindings have added this new, essential ingredient – inclusion - to the recipe for achieving market \nexpansion, a broader knowledge base, robust decision making and innovation in business. The \nresearch notes that in comparison to diversity, there is a lack of academic research on inclusion. It \nfound that: \n Employees who believe their organisation is committed to diversity and also feel included report \nbetter business performance;  \n Focussing not just on diversity but also inclusion enables organisations to unlock their diversity \npotential; and \n Feelings of inclusion are driven by perceptions of fairness and respect; and value and \nbelonging.81 \n \nThe report points out that there has been a lopsided focus on diversity instead of a balanced focus on \n‘diversity + inclusion’ as drivers of business success;82 for example it is possible to have high levels of \ndiversity in a workplace but low levels of inclusion, where people do not feel they belong.  \n \n“This means that to feel highly included, a person would not only say that they are treated fairly and \nrespectfully, but that their unique value is known and appreciated, and they belong to the group”.83 \n \n                                                     \n81 Deloitte and Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission, Waiter, is that inclusion in my soup? A new recipe to improve business \nperformance, Research Report (Sydney: Deloitte, November 2012, 4. \n82 Deloitte and VEOHRC, Waiter, is that inclusion in my soup?, 25. \n83 Deloitte and VEOHRC, Waiter, is that inclusion in my soup?, 12 \nEmbarking on study was of vital importance to Samira not only professionally, but also in terms of \nher overall wellbeing.  “If you stay at home you can feel isolated and depressed”, she says. \nAn avid learner, Samira is now studying for the Diploma in Children’s Services. She balances this \nwith her family responsibilities and work as a family day care educator with the VICSEG-run New \nFutures Family Day Care. She currently looks after two children but plans to increase the number in \nher care when she finishes her studies.  \nSamira enjoys her job and is committed to working in the children’s services sector for now, but is \nopen to what the future might hold. When asked about her career path, she admits that she hadn’t \nconsidered childcare initially, but it became a possibility when she realised her employment options \nwere limited. Despite her overseas experience Samira says her job prospects in health \nadministration were poor due to her lack of English language skills and formal qualifications. \nCombined with not having a driver’s license; looking after two young children and little family \nsupport; the task of finding a job was daunting. “It’s difficult for anyone but especially for women,” \nshe says. \nSource: ECCV interview, August 2013 (name changed) \n30 \n \nThe VEOHRC report has positive implications for both recruiting and retaining a culturally diverse \nworkforce as high commitment to diversity and high levels of inclusion are needed for top performance. \n \n5.4 Local government \nMelbourne is one of the world’s most harmonious and culturally diverse cities with its people coming \nfrom more than 200 countries, speaking more than 230 languages and following more than 130 \nreligious faiths.84 \n \nThat picture is contrasted by the research findings on in the report Employment Barriers and Success \nFactors for Skilled Immigrants in the Melbourne Public Sector (Bertone et al 2011) that show attracting \nand recruiting migrants is not a priority in state and local governments. Further, there is little awareness \nof the possible need to increase workplace diversity, partly because of the lack of partly due to lack of \nreliable or complete data on the countries of birth or cultural backgrounds of their staff.85   \n \nRecruitment \nIn Bertone’s study recruitment processes were described as merit-based, and yet there were a range of \npractices that could disadvantage job applicants from culturally diverse backgrounds86 such as \nemployer preferences to employ people like themselves. Potential barriers to employment for people \nfrom culturally diverse backgrounds listed in the study included: a lack of local contacts, references and \nsupport networks, and other specific requirements such as lack of knowledge of local planning laws, \nliteracy, numeracy, drivers licence, and citizenship. On the positive side the research showed that local \ngovernment participants agreed on the need for workplace demographic change.87  \n \nBoth managers and employees offered a range of positive strategies to improve the recruitment and \nemployment of people from a non-English speaking background in the public sector such as:  \n Mentoring, work experience placements and scholarships for culturally diverse job seekers  \n Reducing the number of key selection criteria and explaining how to address them  \n Removal of names from applications to create a level playing field \n A concerted policy drive to target cultural diversity in recruitment  \n Cultural diversity training for those involved in recruitment. \n Allowing for different approaches to recruitment  \n Collecting workforce data on cultural diversity  \n \n \nRecommendation 13 \nThat Victorian local government develops inclusive recruitment strategies and targets to increase the \nemployment of people from culturally diverse backgrounds to a minimum of at least a third in each local \ncouncil within the next 10 years to reflect the level of cultural diversity in the broader population. \n \n \n                                                     \n84 Plan Melbourne, 2013 a Metropolitan Planning Strategy, Victorian Government \n85 Bertone et al, 2011 Executive Summary: Employment Barriers, 3. \n86 Bertone et al, 2011 Executive Summary Employment Barriers, 3. \n87 Bertone et al, 2011 Employment Barriers, 29. \n31 \n \nSome local governments have begun a commitment to becoming more diverse and inclusive \nworkplaces such as in the Moreland and Whittlesea City Councils. The impact on Victoria population of \nculturally diverse job seekers is small and without State Government endorsement and is therefore not \nyet capable of being promoted as reasonable and required practice. \n \na) Moreland City Council \nThe Moreland City Council’s inclusive Recruitment, Selection and Induction Policy states its support for \ngreater access to employment and traineeships to residents from disadvantaged groups such as youth, \npeople with a disability, indigenous people and people from culturally diverse backgrounds. Whilst some \npositive strategies are implemented, the outcomes have not been formally evaluated. Inclusive \nstrategies include informing relevant employment agencies to encourage applications from local \nresidents in each of the target groups that meet 80 per cent of a position’s selection criteria. \nApplications with diverse backgrounds are then prioritised for interview via their Inclusive Employment \nProgram.88 \n \nb) City of Whittlesea – Work Ready  \nCity of Whittlesea’s Work Ready Project originated in Council’s Multicultural Plan89 and is part of the \nVicHealth’s LEAD (Localities Embracing and Accepting Diversity) pilot program that addresses \ndiscrimination and supports diversity within local communities.  \n \nThe Whittlesea Work Ready Project offers newly arrived adults from migrant and refugee backgrounds \na 12-week work placement at the Council. Participants are sourced through direct applications and \ncommunity organisations that work with new migrants and refugees in the locality. Placements are \nnegotiated with department managers and candidates are screened, interviewed and skill-matched with \ndepartment needs. A daily allowance is given to participants. In general, placements require a \ncommitment of 12 hours per week for 8-12 weeks.90 \n \nIt is a positive inclusive initiative however the community impact is still small. From December 2010 to \nAugust 2012, 43 people from a range of professional backgrounds have been placed in civil \nengineering, marketing and communications, community planning and information technology. Of those \nindividuals, eight achieved employment with the City of Whittlesea and a further seven participants are \nknown to have achieved employment outside of Council.91 \n \n \nRecommendation 14 \nThat Victorian local government reallocates resources and grants to support community-based \nnetworking initiatives for job seekers from new migrant and refugee backgrounds. \n \n. \n                                                     \n88 Moreland City Council, ‘Recruitment, Selection and Induction Policy’, (Moreland City Council: 2013, 5). \n89 “Work Ready Project”, City of Whittlesea, July 2013. http://www.whittlesea.vic.gov.au/your-council/grants-and-major-programs/localities-embracing-and-\naccepting-diversity-project/lead-enews/work-ready-project  \n90 City of Whittlesea, Work Ready Project, Presentation notes at Victorian Local Government Multicultural Issues Network “Workplace Diversity: Workforce \nfor the Future” Forum, Dandenong, 6 August 2013. \n91 City of Whittlesea, “Work Ready Project.” \n32 \n \n5.5 Mentoring  \nResearch shows that job seekers from migrant backgrounds are disadvantaged by a lack of local \nexperience, references and support networks92. While a change in the dominant recruitment paradigm \nwould reduce disadvantage by placing greater value on employees with a global outlook and \nexperience, there is no doubt that migrant job seekers would be more competitive in the labour market if \nincreased opportunities for work experience and mentoring were available. An obvious benefit to \norganisations that offer such programs is the opportunity to put their cultural diversity policies into \npractice. Employers also benefit from ready access to a culturally diverse workforce. Two examples of \nsuccessful work experience and mentoring programs are described below. \n \na) Jesuit Social Services and National Australia Bank – African Australian Inclusion Program \nThe African Australian Inclusion Program is a professional training program for qualified African-\nAustralians, providing six months paid workplace experience at National Australia Bank (NAB). It is a \njoint initiative of the Jesuit Social Services and NAB. Since the program was piloted in 2009 over 90 \npeople were placed in the Melbourne and Sydney NABs. In March 2013 there were 15 participants in \nthe program. Another 78 participants have graduated with an 89 per cent average retention rate.93 \nAlthough the sample is small, this inclusion program is an indication of a successful intuitive that \nbenefits culturally diverse professional job seekers and the workforce. \n \nThe need for the program was identified by the African-Australian community to address the lack of \nlocal experience in the Australian business sector as it was a significant barrier to employment for \nqualified African-Australians. The joint response of the collaborating organisations has been well-\ndocumented and praised by many areas of the broader community. \n \nThe program aims to provide commercial experience and learning opportunities for participants, \nincluding enhancing their business networks. All participants are provided with a workplace coach and \nmentor throughout their placement. Participants are also provided with comprehensive job search \nsupport including interview techniques and resume writing.94 \n \nb) SBS-Deakin-ECCV Media Mentoring Program \nThe SBS-Deakin-ECCV Media Mentoring Program was established in 2012 following concerns raised \nby ECCV regarding negative media portrayals of migrants and aims to increase multicultural diversity \nwithin the Australian media. The Media Mentoring program assists tertiary students from culturally and \nlinguistically diverse backgrounds and refugees to develop career pathways in the media, providing \nthem with hands-on skills and networking opportunities during their studies. Eligible students majoring in \nMedia, Journalism or Public Relations apply in their first year of study at Deakin University. Each intern \nis assigned an SBS mentor and has the opportunity to participate in the National Ethnic and \nMulticultural Broadcasters’ Council Youth Conference. In 2014 five students are undertaking the \ninternship at SBS95. The numbers may be small; however the value lies in the experiences of training \ndiverse people on the job and in lessons to be learnt from the program evaluation. \n                                                     \n92 Bertone et al, 2011 Employment Barriers, 29. \n93 “African Inclusion Program”, Jesuit Social Services, 2013. http://www.jss.org.au/programs/all-programs/african-australian-inclusion-program  \n94 Jesuit Social Services, “African Inclusion Program”. \n95 Ethnic Communities’ Council of Victoria, “Promoting Diversity in the Media”.

Lack of networks and local contacts was cited \nby recent migrants as one of the difficulties in finding their first job in Australia (ABS 2011)97. The report \nWhat Works Employment Strategies for Refugee and Humanitarian Entrants (Refugee Council of \nAustralia June 2010)98 states that opportunities to build social capital, or develop informal social \nnetworks, are rarely provided by employment and job search agencies. ECCV community feedback \nnotes that similar challenges are faced by many international students come to Australia to undertake \nfull-time study in registered courses and subsequently become permanent residents99.  \n \nThe Melbourne Employment Forum (MEF) is a relatively new on-line employment forum to assist job \nseekers with networking. To illustrate how networking that is driven by informal social connections, can \nbe formally supported, it is worth examining a successful international professional networking \nemployment initiative, Les derouilliers (The Scalers100 in English) that assisted first, second and third \ngeneration migrants in France find jobs. \n \nThe following cases include examples of one Victorian and one international community-based \nnetworking initiative, supportive of job seekers from culturally diverse backgrounds in both face-to-face \nand virtual forms. Also included is the case story of one of Melbourne’s young international student that \nprovides a typical insight into the challenges they face.  \n \n  \n                                                     \n96 Melbourne Employment Forum – networking at http://www.melbourneemploymentforum.org.au/employment/how-to-find-the-job/networking/ accessed 28 \nJanuary 2013 \n97 Australian Bureau of Statistics, Perspectives on Migrants 2011, Cat.

MEF currently has \nover 70 member organisations and individuals. The organisation continues to advocate for tailored \nservices for migrant and refugee job seekers. It has produced various resources to help \ndisadvantaged job seekers.  \n \nSource MEF Chairperson \n \n \nLES DEROUILLIERS – AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORKING INITIATIVE \nLes derouilliers (The Scalers1 in English) is an international example of an innovative employment \nnetworking initiative that has helped first, second and third generation migrants find jobs. \n \nThe initiative was started in Paris by Zubair Bin Terdeyet, a young, second generation migrant from \nTunisia. He learnt first-hand as a master’s student struggling to secure an internship, that it wasn’t \njust his skills that were going to get him a job, but knowing people who know people. After \nestablishing a career in Islamic finance, Zubair was inspired to help others without access to the \nhidden job market - word of mouth.  \n \nLes derouilliers held a first meeting in Paris to discuss the challenges about difficulties finding jobs. \nEvening networking meetings were then organised every three months, where employers, \nrecruitment agencies, friends and colleagues and business organisers were invited. Those who had \njobs brought their employers. Networking opportunities were created through informal networking \nmeetings. As momentum built, the group advertised on social media. To register for an event job \nseekers sent in their personal profile and detailed the issues they wished to discuss. The movement \nhas since spread to Paris, London, Germany, Canada and the Middle East and membership has \ngrown from from 41 to 61,000.1 \n \nThe activities of Les derouillers demonstrate how the underrepresentation of people from migrant \nand refugee backgrounds in the workforce may be addressed in a practical and grass roots way. \n \nSource: Youtube clip about les derouilliers – the scalers  at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmvrMOW0a3Y and presentation at ECCV Workforce \nParticipation Policy Sub-committee meeting on 11 July 2013 \n \n \n35 \n \nIn Australia the work rights afforded to international students are limited by their visa class. Even with \nAustralian qualifications, some international students who go on to become permanent residents, still \nface barriers to entering employment at an appropriate level once they have graduated. The following \ncase story is an example of how networking continues to be a challenge to them and is often a crucial \nfactor in gaining suitable employment. \n \nTable 4 Case story of an international student job seeker in Melbourne \n \n \n \nNETWORK, NETWORK, NETWORK - A JOBSEEKER’S STORY \nPenny is happy that her Project Coordinator position at a community organisation that provides \nservices to young people from refugee and humanitarian entrant backgrounds, is about to become \nfull time. The road to finding full-time employment has been somewhat rough, but one that she has \ntackled with resourcefulness and determination.   \nPenny came to Australia four years ago as an international student from the Sichuan Province, \nChina. As a Bachelor of Business (Accounting) student at Victoria University, she relied on part-time \nwork to cover her living costs. Now as a graduate, having a job has been just as crucial for her to \ncontinue living in Melbourne on a Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485).  \nPenny knows a lot about the barriers to finding work for international students and graduates. \nLimited English language skills combined with a lack of confidence and knowledge of workplace \nculture sees many become trapped in hospitality work, often for wages less than the national \nminimum hourly rate. \nUnlike a lot of her friends, however, Penny is not shy. She actively sought friendships with local \nstudents at university which not only enriched her personally, but paid dividends in helping her to \nfind work. Through a friend’s contact, Shirley secured a relatively well paid, two-day-a-week job as \nan Australia Post counter clerk while her international friends continued waitressing. \nAs a graduate, Penny’s networking skills continued to be of vital importance, but she faced new \nobstacles in finding accounting work. “Employers are reluctant to hire people on a 485 visa”, she \nsays. “I attended around 10 interviews but in the end I was always rejected because of my visa \nstatus.” Penny also believes employers won’t consider 485 visa holders for full time work. “They \nthink it’s too risky and they are worried about us handling sensitive information”. In the end, she \ndecided to stop looking for accounting jobs and concentrate on administrative and book keeping \nroles instead. \nUnclear of her exact direction, but understanding the importance of building her experience, Penny \ncontinued the search for work. She secured a three-month part time contract as a book keeper, and \nbefore the full time role at the community organisation came up, juggled an accounts clerk job at a \nconstruction firm two days a week with her other the three-day-a-week Project Coordinator job. \nAgain, Penny attributes her ability to land each of these jobs to her networking skills - contacts \nmade through her friends and her studies - most recently her lecturers at a CPA (Certified \nPractising Accountants) Professional Program. \n36 \n \n \n \n5.7 Social enterprises  \nThe emergence of increasing numbers of social enterprises in the not-for-profit and community sector \nhas provided employment opportunities for new migrants and refugees. Ongoing growth in this sector is \na promising source of sustainable employment for disadvantaged job seekers, including young people \nand women from migrant and refugee backgrounds. \n \nDiscussion about social enterprise is often in the context of improving social inclusion outcomes.101 \nResearch findings in this area are limited but show that social enterprises can contribute to increased \nlevels of employability (either in the enterprise itself or in mainstream employment); and participation in \nsocial enterprises can lead to increased skills, capacities and access to training both formal and \ninformal.102 \n \nThe following are two examples of Australian Government supported business schemes that provide \npractical hands-on training and work opportunities for Victorian’s from culturally diverse backgrounds \nand encourage business ideas.   \n \na) The Social Studio \nAn example of a social enterprise that supports young people from refugee and migrant backgrounds, \nparticularly women, to gain training and jobs is The Social Studio in Collingwood. In partnership with the \nRoyal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and the Australian Migrant Education Scheme (AMES), \naccredited, certificate-level training is provided in fashion and hospitality respectively.  The enterprise \nconsists of clothing production and fashion design technologies using recycled materials and a café. \nThe Social Studio pays above award wages to its trainees and staff, workers are given commission for \nproducts sold in the shop-front and keep 40 per cent of what they produce to sell. This in turn provides \nworkers with the opportunity to create microenterprises within a supported setting.103  \n \nb) Fostering Entrepreneurs – microfinance \nAs noted earlier, humanitarian entrants to Australia are more likely to possess entrepreneurial and risk-\ntaking attributes than other types of migrants regarding the staring of new businesses. For migrants and \nrefugees with a good business concept, securing finance to start a business is difficult due to limited \nfunds, capital or credit history. There are, however, financial institutions that offer microfinance to \nindividuals and organisations that larger, mainstream banks do not normally lend to. These community-\nminded organisations are an important resource for business-minded migrants and refugees. One \n                                                     \n101 Burkett, Ingrid, Social and Community Enterprises Pathways for Women’s Economic Participation.

For the \ninternational student or migrant, “Networking is hard work. You start with nothing”. \nPenny hopes to become a permanent resident in 2014. \nSource: ECCV interview, August 2013 (name changed) \n37 \n \nexample is the Brisbane-based Foresters Community Finance Ltd (Foresters), a Community \nDevelopment Finance Institution (CDFI) that has received funding through the Australian Government’s \nSocial Enterprise Development and Investment Fund (SEDIF).  \n \nForesters use community finance and social investment to service and support people, non-profit \norganisations and social enterprises that are disadvantaged and underserved by mainstream financial \ninstitutions. Operational since September 2011, Foresters’ Social Enterprise Solutions provides access \nto capital, property, business development and equipment purchase for social enterprises nationwide104. \n \n \nRecommendation 16 \nThat all levels of government work in partnership with multicultural community organisations to promote \nresources for social enterprise initiatives that are targeted at new migrant and refugee job seekers. \n \n \n5.8 Preventing workplace discrimination  \nWorkplaces are a priority area for the prevention of racism and discrimination. The ECCV 2013 Work \nSolutions Forum brought together many like-minded stakeholders including organisations with broad, \nsocial reform agendas such as VicHealth and the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights \nCommission (VEOHRC). \n \nBy virtue of its role as an educator of people about the rights and responsibilities contained in the Equal \nOpportunity Act 2010, Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 and the Charter of Human Rights and \nResponsibilities Act 2006, VEOHRC shares common values with ECCV and supports the principles that \ndrive its advocacy work.105 \n \nVicHealth takes a multifaceted approach to improving the health of Victorians and in doing so highlights \nthe impact that social issues have on individual, organisational and community health. VicHealth has \npublished research summaries that present research findings on various issues in an accessible way, \nfor example Ethnic and race-based discrimination as a determinant of mental health and wellbeing and \nAccess to Economic Resources as a determinant of mental health.106 These research summaries \nhighlight the disadvantage faced by new migrants and refugees and the negative effect that being \nsubject to racial discrimination has on one’s mental health and ability to secure employment. VicHealth \nalso funds programs and campaigns such as Localities Accepting and Embracing Diversity (LEAD) (see \nCity of Whittlesea example in 5.4 Local government) and the public awareness campaign See Beyond \nRace.107 \n \n                                                     \n104 Foresters Community Finance Ltd, 2013. http://www.foresters.org.au. \n105 Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission, 2013. http://humanrightscommission.vic.gov.au/index.php/about-us \n106 VicHealth, “Ethnic and race-based discrimination as a determinant of mental health and wellbeing”, Research Summary 3, VicHealth, 2007. \nhttp://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/Publications/Freedom-from-discrimination/Ethnic-and-race-based-discrimination-as-a-determinant-of-mental-health-and-\nwellbeing.aspx ; \nVicHealth, “Access-to-Economic-Resources as a determinant of mental health”. http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/Publications/Economic-\nparticipation/Access-to-Economic-Resources-as-a-determinant-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing.aspx \n107 VicHealth, “See Beyond Race”, VicHealth, 2013, http://www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/Programs-and-Projects/Freedom-from-discrimination/Localities-\nEmbracing-and-Accepting-Diversity/See-beyond-race.aspx  \n38 \n \nA current collaborative project between VicHealth and VEOHRC is the Creating Healthy Workplaces: \nReducing Race-based Discrimination project. A key focus of this project is to build an evidence base by \nidentifying interventions that effectively change workplaces in terms of improving inclusion, participation \nand engagement; and by reducing experiences of race-based discrimination and harassment. The \nthree-year project involves approximately 1,000 employees from a large organisation in the aged care \nsector and will conclude in 2015. \n \n \nRecommendation 17 \nThat media awareness campaigns be developed in partnership with VEOHRC, VicHealth and \nmulticultural peak organisations to improve inclusive and culturally diverse employment policies and \npractices. \n \n \n6.0  RESOURCES FOR EMPLOYERS \n \nECCV feedback indicates that the culturally diverse job seekers’ opportunities to obtain local work \nexperience, improve their English and gain knowledge of Australian workplace culture is compounded \nby the lack of cultural awareness amongst staff in many organisations, as well as the prevalence of \ndiscriminatory recruitment practices. The task of learning to fit into a workplace, however, should not \nrest solely with the newly employed person from culturally diverse background. The resources listed \nbelow show that it is in the interests of all employees and organisations’ productivity to improve their \ncultural competence regarding employment practices. \n \nCultural competency training programs, advice and resources for organisations and employers are \nreadily available. Three notable resources are discussed below. \n \na) The ECCV Cultural Competence Guidelines and Protocols (2006) is a short, practical resource \nproviding guidance to individuals and organisations wishing to become culturally competent.108 The \nguide includes examples of cultural competence at work and Ten Key Questions for Organisations \nStriving for Cultural Competence. \n \nb) An Employer’s Guide to Working with Migrants and Refugees (2013), a significant new resource is \npitched at employers. It details the benefits of employing migrants and refugees and sets out \npractical steps and tips for making their employment a reality. Positive endorsements of having \nmigrant and refugees in their workforce are given by businesses such as Luv-a-duck, ANZ, \nSouthern Meats and Lentil-As-Anything.109 \n \nc) The FECCA Harmony in the Workplace: Portfolio of Factsheets for Australian Employers and \nOrganisations (2013)110 is a comprehensive toolkit that covers a diverse range of issues to develop \n                                                     \n108 Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria 2006, “ECCV Cultural Competence Guidelines and Protocols”, ECCV, December 2006. \n109 Commonwealth of Australia 2013 Connections: An employer’s guide to working with migrants and refugees.

It is a practical resource that dispels myths and \nperceptions about cultural diversity in the workforce; provides innovative strategies for maximising \nthe value of cultural diversity in the workplace and explains legal frameworks concerning workplace \ndiscrimination. This ground breaking comprehensive, research-led and highly practical resource \nalso discusses myths and commonly held misperceptions about cultural diversity in the workplace.  \nIt is a suitable resource for local government. \n \n7.0 CONCLUSION \n \nAfter decades of discussion about migration and employment, the challenges and barriers faced by \nmigrant and refugee job seekers in Victoria are many, varied and complex.  \n \nWhile there are many examples of effective, but fragmented, ‘work solutions’ for migrants and refugees \nalready in place; a more coordinated and cohesive approach is required at individual, organisation, \ngovernment and community levels.  \n \nFundamentally, access to employment by migrants and refugees is a human rights issue and is a \nresponsibility of all three levels of government. The findings of this discussion paper point to the key \nrecommendations such as an in-depth consultation on the overall process of the recognition of \noverseas skills and qualifications; legislation for an Australian Office of Fairness Commissioner and a \nhigh level Victorian State Government Cultural Diversity in Employment Advisory Network. Commitment \nto the recommendations made in this paper would be a positive step towards removing barriers to \nemployment for migrants and refugees and enhance Victoria’s workforce participation.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor more information contact: Dr Irene Bouzo, Senior Policy Officer at email ibouzo@eccv.org.au and \ntelephone 03 9349 4122    \n40 \n \nREFERENCES \n \n“About Social Enterprise”, Social Traders.

    "abstract": "Victoria would do well to make the most of its human resources and embrace newcomers who want to work no matter where they have been educated and gained their skills and experience. Recent research shows that the most productive, profitable and innovative organisations are those with a diverse and inclusive workforce.\n\nWhy then, after 40 years of multiculturalism, do we still find postgraduates from non-English backgrounds working as taxi drivers? Why are young graduates from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds still struggling to make it in the workforce? New challenges and concerns are just starting to emerge with job seekers from new and emerging communities excluded, marginalised and even further disadvantaged by the casualisation of work.\n\n&nbsp",
