INTRODUCTION The transgender communities are producing an important and nuanced critique of our gender system.1  For community members, the project is self-constitutive and, therefore, has an immediacy that also marks the ef-forts of other marginalized groups who have attempted to make sense of the world through description, interrogation, and ultimately a program for transformation.  The transgender project also has universalizing elements because, existing within the gender system, each one of us embodies a par-ticular gender articulation.2  It is through this articulation that we define ourselves in relation to the gender we were assigned at birth, the gender we choose, the gender we create, the gender we reject, the gender we are, and the gender we are assumed to be. Lesbian and gay advocacy organizations officially began to incorporate transgender issues in the late 1990s, as signaled by the now ubiquitous “T” that appears at the end of the popular acronym “LGBT.”3  However, the resulting alliance has been an uneasy one and the incorporation has been partial.4  The feminist reception to transgender issues has been arguably    ∗ Peter J.

In its broadest sense, the term transgender refers “to individuals whose gender identity or ex-pression does not conform to the social expectations for their assigned sex at birth.”  Introduction to TRANSGENDER RIGHTS xiv (Pailsey Currah et al. eds., 2006).  Within the term transgender there are numerous and continually evolving identity formations, such as transwoman, transman, FTM, MTF, genderqueer, genderfuck, trannyfag, trannydyke, bois.  In short, “[t]ransgender is an expansive and complicated social category.”  Id. at xv.    2. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has written on the universalizing and minoritizing aspects of homo-sexuality.

At the outset, it is critical to acknowledge that what might strike us as a relatively esoteric adventure in gender theory represents the lived experi-ence of transgender individuals.6  Although theory can certainly help to illuminate life, and I personally believe that my life has been made richer by it, theory is something we produce to serve the living.  All the theory in the world will not erase the fact that one of the greatest health risks facing transgender individuals is violence.7  This violence is often fueled by tran-sphobic claims of fraud and deception.8  These charges are echoed by the law that also speaks in terms of “gender fraud” and carefully polices the binary gender system in an effort to maintain an objective and knowable gender truth.9  The burdens of the binary fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable segments of society: the poor, the homeless, and the incar-cerated.  It is imperative to make space within the law and within society for individuals to live and express their gender identity as they experience it and choose to define it.  Considerations of how transgender identities and embodiments challenge and expand our own understanding of gender are necessarily tertiary to these pressing issues of safety and legal reform. Given the manifest injustice experienced daily by transgender indi-viduals, it is vexing that many otherwise progressive thinking individuals continue to dismiss transgender issues—saying they just don’t “get it.”  These same progressive thinkers might advocate all manner of non-traditional pursuits for both men and women and generally applaud in-stances of gender variance.  However, when faced with a person who seeks bodily modification or a change in gender markers or a name change or    5. See generally JANICE G.

Growing up, we were told that we could be anything we wanted to be and gender didn’t matter.  In college, we faithfully repeated the mantra that gender was a social construct.12  On some elemental level, we were raised to believe that gender is not real and, therefore, it is difficult for us to fathom how one could take gender so seriously that it literally redefines the person.13  Thus, the first step toward understanding transgender issues is to shed this utopian view of gender.  Of course, gender matters.  We have been living and advocating an aspirational view of gender.  When we stub-bornly say that gender does not matter, what we really mean is that gender should not matter. Once we allow that gender matters, the transgender truth claims re-garding the press and weight of gender no longer ring of false conscious-ness.  This opens the space to explore commonalities.  For example, my early “tomboy” narrative reads much like the stock transman narrative nec-essary to secure a diagnosis of Gender Identity Disorder and the attendant access to medical resources.14  This commonality represents an irrefutable degree of kinship.  The fact that my personal narrative stops short of so-matic dissonance and desire for bodily modification does not prove that I    10. This is also known as the “yuck factor.”  See Leon R.

The DSM-IV classifies GID as a mental disorder.  GID is the diagnosis given to transgender and other gender-variant individuals.  GID replaced the prior term of “gender dysphoria.”  Because GID is classified as a mental disorder, some transgender individuals consider it offensive.  However, the diagnosis is often necessary to secure medical intervention to further bodily modification.

The fact that I have not experienced that desire does not invalidate it. From a position of commonality within our difference, it is then possi-ble to consider how transgender identities and embodiments challenge and enhance our understanding of existing identity formations.  What possibili-ties exist within the categories of man/woman once the gender assigned at birth is no longer an inexorable command?  Are the terms heterosex-ual/homosexual now hopeless incoherencies?  These questions (and others) have produced considerable anxiety in certain identity-based communities, particularly lesbian communities.15  Regardless of any personal feelings of loss or dislocation, I believe that we have a responsibility to engage these challenges rather than dismiss them. Many of us probably share a healthy skepticism of stable identities and various forms of essentialism.  Although we may know that identities are historically contingent, the limits of that knowledge might be tested when the identity in question happens to be the one we are currently using.  For example, we may have no difficulty discussing the myth of the transhis-torical homosexual subject,16 but may bristle at the assertion that someone who was a lesbian and who now identifies as male (and perhaps always did) can still maintain the identification of “dyke” while pursuing relation-ships with other male-identified individuals (who may or may not have been assigned that gender at birth).17  If you had to read that last sentence several times, then I invite you to spend some time on a social networking site with active trans communities, such as LiveJournal.18  The twenty-something generation is presently engaged in a redefinition of gender and sexuality that is guaranteed to make your queer head spin. The fact that the transgender movement has particular resonance to the twenty-something generation (i.e., Generation Y) underscores the historical contingency of identity and places an even greater responsibility on the resistant Baby Boomers and Gen Xers to get with the program of trans    15.

Certainly, the notion of a generation gap is a familiar one.  It is a common tension running through families, as often reflected for our amusement, in novels, movies, and television sit-coms.20  However, the ramifications of a generation gap are very different when it occurs in iden-tity-based communities as opposed to traditional families.21  Within your family of origin, generational miscommunication and conflict mark a rite of passage.  Absent a particularly egregious lapse, the youth does not get thrown out of the house nor does the youth dispossess the parents.  Within an identity-based community, a generational redefinition can mark a com-plete schism.  Resources are wasted, alliances are lost, and inevitably some of the participants are pilloried for their positions.  When we remember that an identity-based community often represents an individual’s chosen family, the threat of expulsion or rejection is especially harsh and can have devastating consequences on both the individual and the group.22 We have the tools to prevent the schism.  The first step is to admit that gender matters, although we can certainly remain convinced that it should not matter.  Second, we should explore commonalities without invalidating difference.  We all experience gender and participate in the gender system.  Third, we have to face our anxiety and re-examine our own identity forma-tions in light of emerging transgender identities and embodiments.  We owe it to ourselves and to the new generation of creative and fearless indi-viduals who are trying to make sense of the gender binary while fashioning new ways to live and love.  They deserve our support.  Besides, the family resemblance is undeniable.    19. See generally WILLIAM STRAUSS & NEIL HOWE, THE FOURTH TURNING (1997) (classifying Anglo-American generational archetypes).  According to Strauss and Howe, Baby Boomers were born from 1943 until 1960.  Gen Xers, also referred to as the Thirteenth Generation, were born from 1961 to 1981.  Generation Y, also referred to as the Millennial Generation, consists of individuals born from 1982 to 2003.  20. The term generation gap was popularized in the late 1960s to reflect the tension between the youth culture of the Baby Boomers and their parents’ generation who had fought in World War II.  21. Gay and lesbian communities are examples of identity-based communities.  Given that homo-phobia may complicate relations with an individual’s family of origin, these identity-based communi-ties may serve as the base for an individual’s “chosen family.”  See KATH WESTON, FAMILIES WE CHOOSE: LESBIANS, GAYS, KINSHIP (1997).    22. Rubin notes, “[a] woman who has been respected, admired, and loved as a butch may suddenly be despised, rejected, and hounded when she starts a sex change.”  Rubin, supra note 15, at 475.

THE NECESSARY LIE: GENDER DOESN’T MATTER The progressive resistance to transgender narratives is rooted in a post-feminist agnosticism regarding the nature of gender as a social construct.23  In many instances, this understanding of gender has served us well.  How-ever, our preoccupation with the temporal nature of gender and gender expression has discounted its present social meaning and ignored the basic fact that, as a social construct, gender matters.  It has also led us to misin-terpret historical transgender identities and embodiments as wholly instru-mental deployments of gender, exemplified by the label “passing women.”24  Accordingly, the chimera that gender doesn’t matter has out-lived its usefulness, and it is time to leave the comfort of its lie. When our parents and teachers and mentors and classmates told us that gender did not matter, what they really meant was that gender should not matter.  In other words, there are no biological or other objective consid-erations that would bar women from excelling in certain professions or prevent men from being nurturing stay-at-home parents.  However, the fact that gender could not thus constrain us as it had prior generations did not mean that gender would not continue to define us.  The transgender narra-tives report first-hand the contemporary significance of gender in the social and political struggle for legibility.25    23. See JUDITH BUTLER, GENDER TROUBLE: FEMINISM AND THE SUBVERSION OF GENDER 7–9 (1990) (discussing cultural construction of gender).  24. JONATHAN NED KATZ, GAY AMERICAN HISTORY: LESBIAN AND GAY MEN IN THE U.S.A. (rev. ed. 1992).  25. Some of the first transgender narratives were compiled by medical researchers who worked to define and diagnose transsexualism.  For example, Harry Benjamin’s 1966 book THE TRANSSEXUAL PHENOMENON detailed his experience with hundreds of transgender patients.  Dallas Denny, Changing Models of Transsexualism, in TRANSGENDER SUBJECTIVITIES: A CLINICIAN’S GUIDE 26 (Ubaldo Leli & Jack Descher eds., 2004).  As discussed infra, these early iterations of the transgender experience became the standard for diagnosis and transgender individuals who desired medical intervention mod-eled their personal narratives to comply with Benjamin’s early case studies.  See infra text accompany-ing notes 89–91.  In addition to these clinical collections, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, transgender individuals produced autobiographies detailing their individual journeys, largely in terms that con-formed to the accepted medical model.  See PAT CALIFIA, SEX CHANGES: THE POLITICS OF TRANSGENDERISM 11–48 (1997) (discussing “first wave” of transsexual autobiography written by of Christine Jorgensen, Jan Morris, and Mario Martino).  The 1980s saw a new wave of transgender autobiography that departed the prevailing medical model and laid the groundwork for transgender activism.  Id. at 163–92 (discussing autobiographical work by Renee Richards, Leslie Feinberg, and Kate Bornsetin).  In recent years there has been an explosion of transgender autobiographical works, including full-length book projects, anthologies, and first-person articles.

It first parses the progressive characterization of any form of gender reassignment as a reactionary measure that re-inscribes the gender binary.  It then demonstrates the difficulty of incorporating trans-gender narratives in a world view where gender is merely a social con-struct.  It concludes with a discussion of how feminist and gay and lesbian histories have erased or demonized transgender identities and how the con-tinued currency of these histories serves to invalidate the contemporary transgender experience. A. Transgender Identities as Reactionary The first stumbling block to accepting, or at least not dismissing, transgender narratives is a lack of empathy.  Perhaps this is because many non-trans-identified progressive individuals do not have a particularly strong sense of being gendered.  Or perhaps it is because our sense of gen-der is in harmony with our assigned and perceived gender, and therefore, gender does not represent a friction point in our lives.  An analogous ex-ample could be the white person who does not have an active awareness that s/he is raced.26 In the course of many conversations, I have heard otherwise progres-sive and open-minded people report that when it comes to transgender is-sues, they just “don’t get it.”  Until recently, I could be counted as among those otherwise progressive folks for whom transgender issues seemed at best foreign and at worst reactionary.  During these, at times, heated con-versations, a commonly heard refrain is: “Why would anyone want to do that?”  The word that can be used as a stand in for any number of steps that indicate a repudiation of the gender assigned at birth: a name change, dif-ferent pronouns, a change in legal gender markers, hormone treatment, surgical modification, or sex reassignment (aka confirmation) surgery.27    METAMORPHOSIS: AN ANTHOLOGY OF TRANSSEXUAL MEMOIRS (Jonathan Ames ed., 2005); WILCHINS, supra note 11 (autobiography).  In addition, the Internet and the opportunity for online social networking has greatly enhanced the availability of transgender autobiographical writing.  See Stephen Whittle, Forward to THE TRANSGENDER STUDIES READER, supra note 3, at xii (noting that “Internet development was crucial to the development of a new, geographically dispersed, diverse trans community in the 1990s”).    26. RUTH FRANKENBERG, WHITE WOMEN, RACE MATTERS: THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF WHITENESS 142 (1993) (describing color-blind thinking as the “polite language of race”).  Attempts by white people to muster empathy often fail because the analogies white people draw regarding race result in trivialization or create “false empathy.”  See RICHARD DELGADO, THE COMING RACE WAR? 4–36 (1996) (discussing dearth of empathy and abundance of “false empathy”).   27. For example, Dean Koluta notes, “I object to the term transgender when applied to transsexuals, since we are not changing our gender . . . but are instead changing our body’s sex.”  Dean Koluta, Introduction to THE PHALLUS PALACE, supra note 25, at xx.

Under this worldview, gen-der variance is desirable, but only provided the individual remains moored to the gender assigned at birth.  Indeed, the transgressive qualities of gen-der variance are only legible if the individual starts with an identifiable and knowable gender.  There can be no meaningful variance without an origi-nal position. Moreover, efforts to jump gender and assert gender self-definition through some form of reassignment—whether social, legal, and/or physi-cal—are branded as the antithesis of the otherwise admired gender vari-ance.  According to this reasoning, taking steps to secure gender recogni-tion is regressive because such actions reinforce the binary gender system which, we all know, is an oppressive social construct at the root of much inequality and human suffering.  This last rhetorical flourish allows the progressive thinker to retain the title of “progressive” while the transgender individual is dismissed as reactionary.28  The progressive thinker is more evolved because s/he sees past the restrictive gender system.  The reason-ing is self-flattering and nicely maintains the status quo.  It goes something like this: After all, gender is just a social construct.  For goodness sake, we have known that since Margaret Mead got back from Samoa.  How sad that some people get trapped by gender and can’t see any other way out.  I’ve never let my gender stop me from doing anything.  Are there still people out there who think you have to change sex in order to act in a certain way?  Is it really worth self-mutilation?  I guess if it causes them such horrendous psychic harm, then medi-cal intervention might be warranted—like the amputee people.  What a shame.  I don’t think medicine should encourage this.29 Obviously, this mode of thinking dismisses the transgender demand for gender recognition consistent with gender identity.  It ignores the fact that transgender individuals report an intense desire for such recognition and denies their claim for the right to gender self-definition.  It also fails to    28. Newitz asserts that “[t]ransgender could . . . be understood as a form of nostalgia for traditional gender.”  Newitz, supra note 13.  29. Joanne Meyerowitz notes: “From the 1920s on, Margaret Mead and others had argued that sex roles which varied across cultures, resulted from social learning.”  JOANNE MEYEROWITZ, HOW SEX CHANGED: A HISTORY OF TRANSSEXUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES 114 (2002).  Susan Stryker relates a similar line of reasoning.

B. Gender Doesn’t/Shouldn’t Matter Unfortunately, this gender agnosticism or outright disbelief in gender might be difficult to shake, given that it has provided many of us with a much needed coping mechanism as we set about the process of self-definition.  As a child of the second wave of feminism, I am the classic post-feminist gender agnostic, and I can’t say that I have ever particularly felt the press or pull of gender.  I suspect that there are a good number of you out there who, like me, go about your daily business secure in the be-lief that anatomy is not destiny and that gender is a social construct.30  We teach this to our children and try to model it for our students.  Indeed, for the women of my generation, many of the steps we took and the life choices we made were only possible because we believed that the tradi-tional concept of woman could not constrain us.  We are the proof that Freud was wrong and Larry Summers be damned.31 For women who grew up in the late 1960s and 1970s, gender and gen-dered expectations could at times be a bit of a drag.32  Our refusal to be-lieve in gender, or be limited by it, did not mean that we escaped the gen-der system or necessarily rejected gender entirely.  In the space between disbelief and rejection, we theorized our participation in terms of individ-ual agency.  As a result, many of us wear our gender lightly—feeling free to pick and choose from a broad range of gender expression.  Some of us wear our assigned gender aggressively, but when we do so, we say that we affirmatively choose it.  As one of my colleagues is fond of saying, “femi-nism gives me the ability to choose to wear pink spike-heeled shoes.”  She then mentions the Emma Goldman (mis)quote about the need to have dancing at the revolution.33  Personally, I have never quite graduated from    30.

BUTLER, GENDER TROUBLE, supra note 23, at 140.  Butler writes:  Gender ought not to be constructed as a stable identity or locus of agency from which vari-ous acts follow; rather, gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts.  The effect of gender is produced through the stylization of the body and, hence, must be understood as the mundane way in which bodily gestures, movements, and styles of various kinds constitute the illusion of an abiding gendered self.  This formulation moves the conception of gender off the ground of a sub-stantial model of identity to one that requires a conception of gender as a constituted social temporality . . . a performative accomplishment which the mundane social audience, includ-ing the actors themselves, come to believe and to perform in the mode of belief.

However, the reforms left in place a binary gender system that the law continues to police with consid-erable zeal.  As discussed below in Part IV.C., I believe many non-transgender individuals would be shocked at the extent to which gender remains an important part of our public life.  Gender may be legally irrele-vant for most purposes, but in order to be a recognizable legal subject, you must first have a legible and legally sanctioned gender.  In this way, the legal reforms instituted in the wake of the second wave of feminism never addressed the fundamental concept of being gendered because it was not something that we ever questioned. It would be a shame to stop our interrogation of the gender system simply because we have managed to carve out sufficient breathing space for ourselves.  Although gender may be a social construct, its danger, and the reason we rail against its limitations, is precisely because we render ourselves socially, politically, and legally legible through gender.  If we are not going to dismantle the gender system, then it is imperative to create sufficient breathing space within the system for everyone—regardless of how they experience gender.  Continued resistance to transgender narra-tives and their demand for gender self-definition robs us of potential allies and abnegates our responsibility to the next generation to continue to act as agents for progressive social change. C. Come to Find Out—Our Histories Often Reflect the Present The same gender agnosticism that helped us navigate difficult life choices also influenced the way we interpreted history and fashioned our role models.  As the second wave of feminism exploded the myth that anatomy was destiny, it looked to history for examples of remarkable women who defied gender barriers.44  The first wave of the related lesbian and gay civil rights movement also mined history to find inspirational ex-amples of same-sex relationships and individuals who risked everything    42. For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in employment “because of . . . sex.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2 (2006).  The Federal Fair Housing Act forbids discrimina-tion in housing based on sex.  42 U.S.C. § 360 (2006).  Title IX prohibits discrimination in education “on the basis of sex.”  20 U.S.C. § 1681 (2006).   43.

These histories have long since passed into the revisionist canon and have been retold to new generations as morality tales where the individual triumphs over the life-denying constraints of gender.  The heroes who emerge tell a consistent story of gender, as exemplified by the stock char-acter of the “passing women.”48  Prior to the second wave, as the story goes, gender roles were so rigid and impermeable that some women had no choice but to pass as men in order to pursue their dreams.  Sometimes these dreams involved practicing medicine.  Other times, the goal was simply to live openly with a female partner.  In either event, these “passing women,” as they were called, chose to masquerade as men to secure male privilege and material advantage.49  Under this retelling, their repudiation of the gender they were assigned at birth was a wholly instrumental deci-sion as opposed to a fundamental need.  Their actions were necessitated by the widely-held false belief that the gender assigned at birth determined an individual’s abilities.  The “passing women,” we learned, were motivated by career goals and/or sexuality—not an overwhelming organic knowledge that they did not belong to the gender they were assigned at birth. It is easy to see how this understanding of “passing women” directly informs the progressive resistance to contemporary transgender narratives.  First and foremost, “passing women” are always women, referred to by their female name and female pronouns.50  Their chosen lives are presented as an elaborate illusion or ruse; the result of a well-executed and com-pletely self-aware performance or masquerade.  They do not represent a    45. See generally LEILA J. RUPP, A DESIRED PAST: A SHORT HISTORY OF SAME-SEX LOVE IN AMERICA (1999).  46.

If one accepts “passing women” as sexually variant career-minded gals who were ahead of their time, then contemporary conditions with respect to gender role options and the recognition of same-sex relationships argua-bly eliminate the need to jump gender.  If gender is no longer a barrier to entry to the professions and same-sex couples can live openly in relative safety, then there remains no cognizable reason for individuals to repudiate their gender assigned at birth.  Under this reasoning, individuals who still express a desire to do so are clinging to outmoded notions of gender.  They are sadly misguided, hopelessly reactionary, and perhaps guided by the corrosive compulsions of internalized homophobia. This portrayal of “passing women” spoke directly to the goals of the second wave of feminism and the related gay rights movement.  As noted in the above section, the two main gender friction points experienced by non-trans identified individuals are gender role limitations and the con-demnation of same-sex relationships.  Just as it is not surprising that the most successful social and legal reforms have concentrated on these areas, it is understandable that the new histories constructed narratives that re-volved around these flashpoints.  By privileging career aspirations and sexuality, the histories established an immediate commonality between the travails of the “passing women” and modern day women.  In addition, the fact that the “passing women” were skilled illusionists reflected a non-essential view of gender as something that can be consciously deployed and adopted instrumentally as may be required by the situation. The seminal characterization of “passing women” as proto-lesbian-feminists was Jonathan Katz’s 1976 highly influential Gay American His-tory.51  Describing the phenomenon of “passing women,” Katz explained that “[d]espite their masculine masquerade, the females considered here can be understood not as imitation men, but as real women, women who refused to accept the traditional, socially assigned fate of their sex, women whose particular revolt took the form of passing as men.”52  In order to reclaim the “passing women” as “women-loving women,” Katz indulged in some striking feats of psychoanalysis that, albeit popular at the time, were exactly the type of phantasmagorical machinations that secured a listing for    51. Id.  52. Id. at 209.  Katz defended his characterization as follows: “In a most radical way, the women whose lives are recounted here rejected their socially assigned passive role; they affirmed themselves as self-determined, active, assertive, powerful—in the way they knew, the guise of men.  These passing women can only be understood within the framework of a feminist analysis.”  Id. at 211.  File: Knauer - 6 Pierce L.

She does not wish to possess a male body; she wants to play ‘the role of a male,’ not be male.  It is not the male’s penis she covets, but the male’s socially given power.”58 In recent years, trans activists have challenged this view of historical figures, including Dr. Hart.  In 1982, a lesbian and gay advocacy group in Oregon inaugurated a service award in the name of Lucille Hart that was presented at a dinner bearing the same name.59  Consistent with Katz’s treatment of Hart as a female-identified lesbian, information the organiza-tion prepared about Hart used his birth name, referred to him with female pronouns, and described him as “Oregon’s most famous lesbian.”60  This prompted protests from trans activists who urged the organization to set the record straight—Dr. Alan Hart was a transman.61  Under pressure, the gay organization finally relented in 1996 and stopped using Hart’s name en-tirely.62 Other examples of this (mis)understanding of trans identities include the way the media reported the 1996 murder of Brandon Teena63 and the 1989 revelation that the deceased jazzman Billy Tipton was born female.64  In the case of Brandon Teena, much of the press coverage used female    53.

As his biographer ex-plained in 1998, “Billy was not unique in solving an economic problem or seizing a tempting opportunity just by donning trousers.”66 In addition to retelling these heroic tales of instrumental gender vari-ance, the emerging fields of women’s history and gay and lesbian history also addressed the question of gender roles within the gay and lesbian communities.  Unlike the individual tales of gender variance, the adoption of group-wide gender standards was not valorized. Instead, it was the brave souls who resisted community gender norms who were lauded for their vision and fortitude.  This reflected the con-certed effort to distance the contemporary gay rights movement from im-ages of gender inversion and what was referred to as “role playing.”67  The continued association of homosexuality with cross-gender performance was denounced as the result of either false consciousness exhibited by some community members who reflexively aped hetero-patriarchy or an unfortunate and persistent stereotype that originated with the early sexolo-gists.68  Drag queens were asked not to participate in early Gay Pride Pa-rades, and the vibrant butch/femme communities of the 1950s were con-demned as nothing more than a stifling facsimile of post-war gender roles and expectations.69  The hostility directed at gender-atypical deployments of homosexuality undoubtedly helps to explain the sometimes uneasy and tumultuous incorporation of the “T” portion of LGBT.70 Two very influential nonfiction books, published ten years apart, pro-vide an excellent example of how feminist and gay and lesbian histories treated community-wide atypical gender norms.  Both books told the story of equality-minded young lesbians who felt alienated and excluded from the 1950s bar culture due to their unwillingness to assume a butch or    65.

The 1972 book Lesbian/Woman71 was one of the first lesbian-affirming books put out by a mainstream publisher for a general audience.  Authored by Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, founders of the pre-Stonewall homophile group the Daughters of Bilitis, the book was widely popular and reissued in a twenti-eth anniversary edition.72  Written when homosexuality was still classified as a mental disorder, the book directly refuted the psychoanalytic under-standing of the female homosexual as a “pseudo male”73 with a feminist interpretation of women-identified-women. Lesbian/Woman had nothing good to say about the butch/femme cul-ture, except that it was on the wane.  Clear that “[l]esbians are women who are attracted to women,”74 the authors explained that lesbians often fell into butch/femme behavior due to cultural “brainwashing,”75 noting that many “[l]esbians are caught up in the myths and stereotypes so prevalent in our society.”76  According to Martin and Lyon, all lesbians who engaged in “role-playing” suffered from false consciousness.77  In this way, the au-thors were not merely attempting to establish women-loving-women as distinct from butch/femme identifications; they were attempting to dis-credit butch/femme identities in their totality.  For example, the authors include the first person narrative of a stone butch, but they roundly dismiss the narrator’s assertion that desire, for a stone butch, is “heterosexual.”78  Using psychoanalytic terms similar to the ones they purport to reject, Mar-tin and Lyon explain that the truth claims made by stone butches are sim-ply “the way they have rationalized their feelings against the inferior status of being a woman.”79  The authors then continue to connect the dots be-tween butch behavior and the patriarchy, noting, “[s]trangely, it is those women who feel they were ‘born butch’ who tend to ape all the least desir-   71.

Lorde explains that she and a small handful of friends were “part of the ‘freaky’ bunch of lesbians who weren’t into role-playing, and who the butches and femmes . . . disparaged with the term Ky-Ky or AC/DC.  Ky-Ky was the same name that was used for gay-girls who slept with johns for money.  Prostitutes.”85 However, unlike Martin and Lyon, Lorde does not bother to psycho-analyze why the butches were butchy and the femmes were femmy.  To Lorde, the link between role-playing and hetero-patriarchy was clear: For some of us, however, role-playing reflected the depreciating attitudes toward women which we loathed in straight society.  It was a rejection of these roles that had drawn us to “the life” in the first place.  Instinctively, without particular theory or political po-sition or dialectic, we recognized oppression as oppression, no matter where it came from.  But those lesbians who carved some niche in the pretend world of dominance/subordination, rejected what they called our “confused” life style, and they were in the majority.86 Although later histories would re-examine the butch/femme lesbian communities of the 1950s through queer eyes, these early histories remain a searing indictment of group-held atypical gender norms.87  Like the sto-   80.

Butch/femme identities are not seen as anything more than gender play, with butches and femmes merely “aping” heterosexual behav-ior.  As with the “passing women,” the deployment of gender was a con-scious choice, but in the case of butch/femme norms it lacked any libera-tory value. III.  COMMON GROUND As explored in the last section, a combination of personal experience, liberation ideology, and historical understanding can conspire to silence transgender truth claims.  Contemporary transgender narratives provide a first-hand account of gender as it is lived and experienced by some indi-viduals at the beginning of the twenty-first century.  The fact that these narratives may ultimately have a different trajectory than our own gender narratives simply makes them different, not invalid.  We all have stories of navigating the gender system.  Being gendered, either by self or others, is an experience we all share, and there is likely no single truth to be born of that shared experience.  In this age of subjectivity, a charge of false con-sciousness rings of hubris and carries its own disturbing pretense of he-gemony. This section examines the commonality of gender narratives.  Borrow-ing from my own gender atypical childhood, it examines the similarities between the stock transman narrative and that of a standard “tomboy” nar-rative and asks whether perhaps we aren’t all a little genderqueer?88  It then discusses gender identity formation on the binary and the ways in which greater room for gender variance may actually facilitate transgender identi-fications rather than render them obsolete as maintained by the progressive critique.  It concludes with a brief discussion of the integral role gender variance continues to play in gay and lesbian communities, despite the persistent efforts to establish sexuality as unrelated to or separate from gender or gender expression.

However, the price of this gender vari-ance is continued allegiance to the gender assigned at birth.  Gender vari-ance that leads to bodily modification, a repudiation of the gender assigned at birth, or a desire to jump gender legally or socially, steps over a line and is deemed reactionary.  In this way, the progressive critique of gender al-lows us to choose to wear our assigned gender aggressively, lightly, or even with a measure of dissonance, but we must wear it in order to be legi-ble.  Thus, when we tell our female children, “you can be anything you want in the whole wide world,” the promise carries an unspoken caveat—“except, of course, a boy.” When I first began my self-education process regarding transgender is-sues, I was surprised to learn that my gender atypical childhood closely tracked the standard transman narrative prescribed by the most widely ac-cepted standards of care.89  These standards regulate access to certain medical interventions and produce what Judith Butler refers to as the “dramaturges of transsexuality.”90  The politics of diagnosis are outside the scope of this article, and much has been written regarding the gate keeping function of the standards as well as the self-perpetuating nature of the re-quired narratives, which individuals must repeat in order to gain the de-sired access.91  However, the key factors of the gender atypical childhood actually described my childhood.  I would not have had to engage in any embellishment to satisfy the following elements of gender identity con-flicts in childhood: “[C]ross dressing, playing with games and toys usually associated with the gender with which the child identifies; avoidance of the clothing, demeanor and play usually associated with the child’s sex and gender of assignment, preference for playmates or friends of the sex and gender with which the child identifies.”92 When I was a little girl, my family encouraged me to engage in non-traditional rough and tumble play.  Although I had both “boys” and “girls” toys, the “girls” toys stayed on the shelf.  Barbie could not hold a candle to G.I. Joe, and who would possibly want to play in a “Dream House” when    89.

No one in my family raised an eyebrow when I donned my Batman outfit, peered out from under the hood, and proclaimed that I would be a senator one day.94 As I read the transgender childhood summaries, I kept waiting to find one that would turn out like mine—one where the protagonist who was assigned female at birth grew up comfortable in her body and visibly fe-male, but continued some of her tomboy pursuits and bought the occa-sional item of clothing on the “wrong” side of the GAP.95  I never found that ultimate flash of recognition because I was reading about a different experience of gender.  I was reading transgender narratives, and my child-hood story was missing one of the primary elements of gender identity disorder in childhood: the “stated desire to be the other sex.”96 It is difficult to comprehend that desire when you have no personal ex-perience with either internal or external gender dissonance.  I have never felt out of place in my female body, and I have never been mistaken for a man (as far as I know).  For me, gender is not a friction point in my life.  My preference for gender neutral clothing is a relatively mild one.  Al-though I value that I have a job where every day is casual Friday, I enjoyed my high femme years at a law firm and have never given up the purse habit.  My time as a power bow femme could be described as a form of drag, in that I was engaged in a self-conscious deployment of gender, but it did not feel like a cross-gender performance, nor was it necessarily in-tended as a parody.97  My aim was transgressive.  As one of the few self-identified lesbians at the law firm in the 1980s, I had decided I could best disrupt the partners’ understanding of the category of “lesbian” by looking, or trying to look, just like their WASPy wives.  I have since been told that    93.

By asserting myself as not male, I thought I was helping to destroy the “myth of the mannish les-bian.”99 Despite the different endings, I found it exceedingly enlightening to see the similarities between my childhood and that of many transgender individuals, and I resisted the impulse to reject the transgender stories as my own simply because they did not share a common outcome.  I had weathered a gender-atypical childhood without experiencing the desire to modify my body or otherwise repudiate the gender I was assigned at birth.  Did this mean that I was better adjusted than the transman because I could navigate the cultural construct of gender without becoming a victim to its literal demands?  Or, was it just as possible that, unlike the transman, I was hopelessly domesticated as illustrated by my not-so-transgressive shenani-gans at the law firm—socialized to the point where everything is possible except living in a gender different from the one assigned at birth? These dueling propositions are both built on claims of false conscious-ness paired with transformative vision.  In the first instance, I am possessed of great vision whereas the transman is trapped in a literal application of gender.  In the second, I suffer from a copious lack of vision whereas the transman is able to see beyond labels.  Neither is necessarily true.  The way I choose to define myself in the world and within the gender system is simply different from that of someone who identifies as transgender.  The important thing I learned, however, was that no matter how fundamental that difference might be, it is rooted in a basic commonality that provides an undeniable degree of kinship. Indeed, gender variant behavior has served as a longstanding bridge between the transgender and gay and lesbian communities.  The standards for care quoted above note that in actuality, relatively “few” gender variant children grow up to be transsexuals, although “many eventually develop a homosexual orientation.”100  This makes one wonder about the efficacy of diagnosis or perhaps it suggests that I actually am transgender.  According to the early sexologists, “contrary sexual feelings” were the result of a form of sexual inversion that was marked by same-sex libidinal object choice, as well as a penchant for wearing pants and an aversion to needle-   98.

In some circles, the term “genderqueer” has emerged as an umbrella category that is distinguished by its oppositional stance to gender and its critique of the binary.102  The tensions existing between the terms gender-queer and transsexual and their associated communities are beyond the scope of this article and far exceed my level of expertise, but for the pur-poses of this discussion, it can be said that genderqueer is a subset of transgender.103  Genderqueer’s oppositional stance may represent a point of entry for many who otherwise suffer from the progressive resistance to transgender truth claims.  In its broadest sense, genderqueer embraces a fluidity of gender roles and behaviors that encompasses the type of gender variance generally approved within the progressive understanding of gen-der.  However, genderqueer parts company with the progressive critique in that it rejects not simply the gender role behavior and expectations associ-ated with one’s gender assigned at birth, but the act or meaning of that assignment.104  In this way, genderqueer advances a greater degree of gen-der self-definition and individual agency than the progressive critique. Genderqueer also marks the generation gap between the twenty-somethings and the rest of us.  On more than one occasion, I have been read as genderqueer by students.  I believe their characterization is based on my clothing choices, absence of stereotypical feminine grooming habits (i.e., make-up), and the open knowledge that I’m a lesbian.  The first time this happened, my own transphobia got the best of me, and I literally went running to the shoe department at Bloomingdale’s looking for something “a little less clunky.”  On reflection, I believe that the descriptor gender-queer provides a potentially useful connection between my own post-feminist gender agnosticism and the contemporary transgender narrative.  Although the identity category genderqueer carries no personal resonance for me, it does provide a strategic location for theorizing gender that is not overly consumed with slaying the long-dead dragons of Freudian thought.    101. I am not making this up.  Havelock Ellis specifically noted that female inverts sometimes dis-play a “dislike and . . . incapacity for needlework and other domestic occupations, while there is often capacity for athletics.”  HAVELOCK ELLIS & JOHN ADDINGTON SYMONDS, SEXUAL INVERSION (1897), excerpted in NINETEENTH-CENTURY WRITINGS ON HOMOSEXUALITY: A SOURCEBOOK 100 (Chris White ed., 1999).    102.

It rejects but does not deny the binary.  In this way, the notion of genderqueer differs dramati-cally from the aspirational view of gender discussed in Part II.  Whereas the latter maintains that the binary is not real and, therefore, cannot define you, genderqueer allows for the realness of gender but declares it to be ultimately malleable and fluid.  Despite its intellectual appeal, I know many folks my age that would be uncomfortable with the identity category of genderqueer precisely because of the way it foregrounds gender.  The label genderqueer signals an oppositional stance to gender as a primary mode of identification.  As a gender agnostic, this personally places too much emphasis on gender, but I recognize that on this point I am just being stubborn.  My partner/wife likens my resistance to Radclyffe Hall’s insis-tence that she was a congenital invert long after the sexologists’ ship had sailed.105  This has prompted me to repeatedly ask her whether I really look genderqueer, to which she will only reply, “if the shoe fits.” B. We All Experience Gender Even if you reject the proposition that we are all a little genderqueer, you will have to allow that we all experience gender, and to varying ex-tents we all participate in the gender system.106  I recall making this point during a meeting regarding student public interest and pro bono work.  When the topic turned to transgender advocacy, a colleague remarked that s/he “wasn’t feeling it” because the topic was too limited, it affected too few people, and, indeed, it might alienate students who would otherwise be interested in working in the public interest.  Several months later, another colleague voiced a similar concern when s/he expressed skepticism over my new research agenda (i.e., transgender legal issues), stating: “I don’t know how much of a social problem this is actually going to turn out to be.”  Both of these comments emphasize the minoritizing nature of trans-gender issues, and they both fail to apprehend the universal, albeit cultur-ally contingent, experience of gender.107 This minoritizing view of gender is consistent with the notion that there is something hopelessly myopic and conventional in the way trans-gender individuals cling to gender and desire gender recognition.  It seems    105. See infra text accompanying notes 150–55.  106. Wilchins argues that “[i]n a society where femininity is feared and loathed, all women are gen-derqueer.

How can we reconcile, the reasoning goes, the fact that many of us bristle at the restraints of gender whereas as others actively seek refuge within the very system we hope to render obsolete?108  It seems that at the end of the day, the only thing to say with a shrug is: gender: some of us can’t live within it—others can’t live without it. When faced with this double bind, the natural reaction seems to be to dismiss the transgender assertions regarding the importance of gender be-cause it is not possible for gender to be both a restrictive life-denying force and a necessary pre-condition for human flourishing.109  I believe that this double bind has been overstated and neglects our core commonality of being gendered—whether by self or by others.  The characterization that transgender individuals are running back into the embrace of gender per-petuates the notion of the transgender individuals as reactionary, as op-posed to the visionary individuals who are committed to seeing past gen-der. Although at first glance it might seem that the two groups are working at cross purposes, when viewed from a slightly different angle it can just as easily be said that both of us are trying to achieve escape velocity from the expectations and limitations imposed on us by virtue of the assignment of gender at birth.  Ultimately, trans and non–trans alike are attempting to navigate the gender system in the hope of finding space to live.  This is a primary unifying force, and it is the primary reason (beyond a basic and unwavering commitment to human rights) that transgender issues are of importance to every one of us.  Unfortunately, non-trans individuals often fail to see the extent of this commonality because, for us, it is often easy to forget that we are actively gendered.110  Indeed, this is precisely the prob-lem; for many of us gender is simply a non-issue.  It is not a source of daily friction and discomfort. One of the things that seems particularly perplexing to non-trans indi-viduals is why transgender narratives move across the binary.  As dis-   108. Butler writes: “[A] livable life does require various degrees of stability.

Butler writes:  The normative aspiration at work here has to do with the ability to live and breathe and move and would no doubt belong somewhere in what is called a philosophy of freedom.

However, a significant por-tion of transgender individuals experience distress and difficulty when they repudiate the gender they were assigned at birth and attempt to secure a different set of gender markers.  Although non-trans progressive individu-als support the repudiation of the set of expectations assigned at birth via the proxy of gender, they often fail to grasp why the repudiation of one’s assigned gender necessarily leads to identification as a different gender.  You can almost hear the progressive thinker ruminating: “I didn’t jump ship.  No sir-ree.  I stayed the course and worked to change the system from within my assigned gender.  I stayed true to my assigned gender.” Of course, this begs the question of why an assignment of gender at birth based on a series of visual and physical cues continues to carry such weight.  If it is an irrelevancy and it cannot control our destinies, then why not respect the right of individuals to choose or to define their own gender?  Scarcely any of the progressive thinkers uncomfortable with transgender requests for gender self-definition would argue the same in the case of in-dividuals who are intersexed.111  The interesexed are different, the argu-ment goes, because they experience incongruence between physical gender and the gender assigned at birth.112  This reasoning privileges the physical as the true situs of gender.  An individual is required to maintain loyalty to the gender assigned at birth unless there are verifiable physical anomalies that put the assignment in question ab initio.  The intersex dilemma also reveals that the assignment of gender at birth is an imperfect practice that is not above putting a thumb on the scale to tip the balance by way of sur-gical intervention.113  The progressive critique maintains that the desire to repudiate the gender assigned at birth cedes too much power to the socially constructed gender system, but it fails to question the act of initial assign-   111. See generally SUZANNE J. KESSLER, LESSONS FROM THE INTERSEXED (1998) (defining intersex-uality and the medical construction of gender).

In this way, it denies individual agency and cedes the ultimate power of naming to a set of purportedly “objective” physical criteria that are nonetheless a socially constructed component of the gender system.114 To the non-trans-identified, the apparent increase in the number of in-dividuals who desire to move across the binary seems counter-intuitive given that there is currently considerable social room to express gender variant behavior.115  Under this rationale, the gender assigned at birth now, more than ever, is an irrelevancy because the categories of woman and man—to the extent that they are stable categories—are greatly expanded.  Although it is certainly true that one’s gender assigned at birth allows for greater freedom of expression, it is also true that one’s target gender also provides greater freedom.  Thus, a movement across the binary need not be seen as the exchange of one too-small identity for another.  Provided nei-ther category is prohibitively constraining, and either category can be con-ducive to human flourishing, then a movement between categories would seem neutral.  When the progressive critique asserts that such movement reinforces an oppressive gender system, it denies agency in the name of greater freedom but also accepts the initial process of categorization as beyond challenge. The progressive bewilderment with movement across the binary re-flects the larger belief that gender doesn’t matter, but it also reveals a spe-cific rejection of a binary spectrum of behavior that ranges from male to female.  For many of us born in the 1960s and 1970s, the gender we had been assigned at birth was small and confining.  Although the life choices we made often placed us outside of the traditional definition of “woman” (or “man”), we did not believe that every step we took beyond our assigned gender necessarily propelled us toward the other gender.  For example, when I was born in 1961, Betty Friedan had yet to publish her manifesto, Ozzie and Harriet was still on the air, and women made up 3.5% of the nation’s law students.116  There was no Title VII, no maternity leave, help    114.

However, the range of possi-bilities that we explored outside the traditional category of “woman” were not coded “man” and our actions did not take place on a tightly drawn spectrum that ran from male to female.  We were not rushing to become men and, besides, we knew plenty of people who were actively trying to break out of that equally moribund and confining category.  The space outside “woman” belonged to the realm of the human yet to be defined. My insistence—that women who sought greater role options were not trying to become men—echoes a particular sensitivity on the part of sec-ond wave feminists to the masculine-baiting that historically dogged ef-forts to secure greater rights for women.  Early arguments against allowing women access to higher education stressed the masculinizing effects of education on the female form.121  Later, the popularized version of penis envy provided a psychoanalytic explanation for women who sought full    117.

Who wouldn’t envy power? Both the feminist rejoinder to penis envy and the post-structuralist re-working of penis envy reject out of hand the possibility that an individual assigned female at birth could desire bodily modification that would in-clude a penis.  According to the feminist, the desire for a penis is a lie.  According to the post-structuralist, the desire may be true, but only on a symbolic level because the penis is a metaphor.  In the face of these theo-retical claims, some transgender narratives report the desire for bodily modification and severe distress when access to such modification is im-peded.  This presents a clear challenge for individuals who, like me, have been raised on the notion that gender is an extended metaphor.  The chal-lenge is to integrate the reality of transgender experiences into our under-standing of the gender system and our own relationship to gender. The first step is to recognize that many of the insights that we received as enlightened wisdom in our Women’s Studies courses were historically specific, in that they were aimed squarely at displacing then-predominant views regarding gender in general and the feminine in particular.  As illus-trated by the case of Lyon and Martin, well-meaning efforts in the 1970s to establish new identities had the direct effect of silencing and repudiating alternative trans identities.  Second, we have to admit that gender matters and it carries real life consequences—for all of us.  Gender is not the result of massive Cold War brainwashing used to such great effect in the Man-churian Candidate nor is it a trendy French metaphor.132  In real life, some individuals report that their gender assigned at birth does not coincide with their internal sense of gender.  They also report a desire to express their internal gender in ways that may or may not include bodily modification.  A necessary corollary of this expression is the need for their internal gen-der to be recognized socially and legally.  When the progressive critique denies the right to gender self-definition, it diminishes all of us who par-ticipate in the gender system.  We all experience gender, but we do so in different ways and to different degrees.    132. Jack Hitt, Return of the Brainwashing Defense, N.Y.

There remains one additional and unde-niable point of convergence.  Despite efforts to distance gay and lesbian identities from cross gender stereotypes, drag and other forms of gender bending remain an integral cultural component of many gay and lesbian communities.  Indeed, the early sexologists considered homosexual object choice to be one component of a larger, naturally occurring phenomenon of gender inversion where women acted (and felt) like men and men acted (and felt) like women.134  At the time, the inherent heterosexual nature of desire was so strongly presumed that when a female-assigned person re-ported a female sexual object choice, she was necessarily exhibiting cross gender behavior.135  According to Krafft-Ebing’s scale of inversion, same-sex object choice without any other cross-gender behavior would warrant classification on the first rung of inversion.136  The gradations of inversion increased in severity as homosexual desire was joined with ever greater degrees of cross-gender behavior and identification until the subject re-ported total repudiation of the gender assigned at birth and active identifi-cation with the target gender.137 The presumption that sexual desire was naturally heterosexual is used to illustrate the heteronormative bias of the sexologists, and they are often    133.

In addition, cross-gender behavior forms the core of many ho-mophobic stereotypes and animates homophobic violence.139 We all know that homophobic slurs are frequently used not to signal actual homosexual activity or desire but to indicate that the object of the slur has stepped beyond the acceptable role for her/his assigned gender.140  For example, a strong assertive woman who excels in business may be called a dyke, whereas the sensitive artistic man may be dismissed as a fag.  Indeed, some legal scholars have gone as far as to suggest that discrimina-tion against homosexuals is most appropriately (and productively) ana-lyzed as gender discrimination.141  For example, when the law prohibits a man from marrying another man, it is discriminating on the basis of gender because the man would be able to marry a man if he were a woman.142  Unfortunately, efforts to combat these slurs and stereotypes have often focused on a denial of cross-gender behavior as opposed to a condemna-tion of the fact that it remains acceptable to respond to such behavior with ridicule, disgust, and violence. Although the sexologists have been credited with linking (erroneously, some would argue) homosexuality with gender variant behavior, it is im-portant to remember that their act of naming and mapping the homosexual was not an entirely top down endeavor.143  Inverts participated in the re-   138.

Foucault noted that “[h]omosexuality appeared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of inte-rior androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul.”  1 FOUCAULT, supra note 68, at 43.    139.

Foucault described “reverse discourse as the ability of the subjects of study to appropriate the language and pronouncements of their elite observers and use it to articulate a program for reform.”  1 FOUCAULT, supra note 68, at 43.  Foucault argued that the sexologists made possible the formation of a “reverse” discourse: “[H]omosexuality began to speak [o]n its own behalf, to demand that its legiti-macy or ‘naturality’ be acknowledged, often in the same vocabulary, using the same categories by which it was medically disqualified.”  Id.

It re-flects a deep historical affiliation, shared cultural space, and a common source of oppression.145 It is now well-known that transgender individuals were instrumental in the early gay liberation period immediately following Stonewall but were increasingly marginalized and displaced by both feminism and identity politics.146  We have seen how efforts at positive identity formation in the 1970s obliterated and invalidated transgender realities in their rush to re-pudiate Freudian theories and counter destructive stereotypes.  This nega-tion of transgender realities influenced both how we understood history and how we understood ourselves.  Contemporary gay identity politics constructed a “straight-acting” gay subject who was gender conforming in all respect but desire (assuming desire has a gender).147  The continuing resistance to transgender issues within the mainstream lesbian and gay advocacy organizations and within the lesbian and gay communities in general is not surprising given this decades-long denial and marginaliza-tion of transgender identities.148  However, the formal inclusion of trans-gender issues represents an important step toward embracing our common history and our common (albeit not uncomplicated) connection to gender. IV.  IDENTITIES AND THE LAW Transgender narratives reject the unassailable congruence between the gender assigned at birth and gender identity.  They assert and attest to the reality of gender and the degree of security that can be produced by an easily legible gender.  Most forcefully, they demand a right to gender self-   144.

Some progressive resistance to transgender truth claims has been rooted in the perceived threat to existing identity categories.  Lesbian communities in particular have had difficulty incorporating transgender possibilities despite the common experience of gender discussed in the prior section.  This section first reminds us that identity formation is his-torically contingent and urges us to heal the generational divide by further-ing a process of identity formation that can articulate both commonality and difference. It also discusses the potential opportunities represented by the use of queer as a strategic position of alliance and argues that, at base, we are all probably a little bit queer.  Finally, it asks us to imagine what types of legal reform would be necessary to create space for the type of gender self-definition envisioned and demanded by the transgender narrative—one that respects internal gender identity, gender expression, and gender embodi-ment. A. The Shifting Sands of Identity My initial interest in transgender issues arose while I was doing re-search for an article on the obscenity trials of the 1928 novel by Radclyffe Hall, The Well of Loneliness.149  The Well is frequently described as the most influential lesbian novel of all time.150  As I busily explored the simi-larities between the arguments used to condemn The Well and contempo-rary anti-gay rhetoric, a series of online searches revealed to me the extent to which the book also resonates within certain transgender communi-ties.151  In retrospect, the duality of the book and its author is obvious, but I was so accustomed to denying the reality of gender that I interpreted the gender expression of the protagonist as some form of art deco lesbian chic.  Indeed, in my article I had refused to cite an early biography of Hall that had identified her as a “transvestite” because I considered its perspective compromised by an unreflective acceptance of gender inversion.152  I never consider whether my unreflective denial of gender inversion had comprised my perspective.    149.

It was not until I experienced my own personal frisson at the term gen-derqueer that I began to look sympathetically on individuals, such as Hall, whose identity formations took place under a prevailing historical model only to have that model overtaken by newer and more culturally relevant models.  In terms of a contemporary example, Susan Sontag comes to mind as an individual who may have existed on this sort of historical cusp.156  She staunchly refused to identify as lesbian or gay despite wide reports indicating the contrary.157  Like many, I had attributed Sontag’s refusal to self-identify as simple homophobic denial that she tried to justify in the name of preserving (or obscuring) authorial voice.158  It never occurred to me that she might have refused to identify as lesbian or gay simply because she didn’t identify as lesbian or gay.159  My reaction reflects an odd feature    153.

There is a tipping point where a new iden-tity category achieves sufficient political valence that the question of self-identification becomes irrelevant and refusal to self-identify is read as un-truthful denial.  In this way, an identity category that was initially self-constitutive becomes a higher truth that others can declare on your behalf without your assent.160 These observations regarding the historical contingency of identity did not come as a surprise to me.  I am well-versed in the myth of the transhis-toric homosexual and have written about the evolution of the invert to the homosexual to the homophile to gay men and lesbians.161  I know that this evolution did not take place seriatim, in that new understandings of same-sex desire did not neatly and completely displace the prior ones.162  Through a complex process of asymmetric collaboration between the elites and the subject population, the competing theories vied for acceptance, achieved varying degrees of professional validity, and eventually infil-trated conventional wisdom.163  They became part and parcel of how indi-viduals saw themselves and the world around them.  None of this knowl-edge was new to me, but it was decidedly dislocating to realize that the identity marked as contingent and waning was one that, despite my am-bivalence discussed in section B below, I was still using.  It is one thing to watch historical contingent identity formations march across the pages of a book or the frames of a documentary; it is quite another to experience it in the here and now. The emergence of transgender communities and their compelling truth claims represent a new subjectivity that uniquely configures questions of gender, identity, and self-determination.  Transgender realities, therefore, challenge existing progressive gender and sexuality identity formations to jettison the gender taboo, admit to the weight of embodiment, and attempt to articulate an understanding of self and others that exist in the present.  As discussed in earlier sections, the second wave of feminism and the first wave of gay liberation set about to construct identities that were self-consciously oppositional in that they directly engaged and refuted the pre-vailing and exceedingly damaging psychoanalytic model of gender and sexuality.  A central feature of this oppositional stance was an abstraction of gender and a denial of the physical.  Gender variant behavior was en-   160.

This extreme oppositional stance is no longer a pre-requisite to a posi-tive identity.  I was frankly astonished when I reread Lesbian/Woman and Gay American History in preparation for this article.164  They were two of my favorite texts in high school, and I remember them being exceedingly foundational.  However, thirty years after the fact, I was offended by their blunt attempts to harness liberation ideology to clear huge swaths of terri-tory with blanket claims of false consciousness.  I emerged with a new appreciation for the term “baggage.”  If these texts would fail to persuade me today, why should I let them continue to influence my world view?  Freud is dead, and it is time to move on. After the shock wears off, being faced with impending obsolescence can prove invigorating.  The emergence of transgender issues represents a historical shift in identity as well as a potential generational struggle.  However, in this case, any resulting generational divide would have to be driven by shear intransigence given that we have just established that the internalized taboo regarding the reality of gender was a historical device that is no longer needed.  Generational struggles are never pretty, but they can be devastating when they occur in an identity-based or political com-munity.165  For example, the reports of the Lavender Menace debacle of the early 1970s still sting with a sense of betrayal.166  I have my own memories of the heated Sex Wars of the 1980s and even now shudder when I remem-ber the scene at the Women and the Law Conference in 1985 when Cath-erine MacKinnon’s speech was interrupted by pro-sex hecklers and all manner of nastiness ensued.167 Flash points between gay and lesbian communities and transgender communities have also led to claims of betrayal and double dealing.168  Perhaps the most disturbing skirmishes have occurred between feminists and transgender communities in connection with the definition “women-only space.”169  The longstanding dispute centered on the admission poli-   164.

They are lived experiences which deserve our respect and support.  Historically, transgender narratives were silenced in the rush to create positive feminist and gay identities, but building your life on the backs of others is never a noble endeavor, and the result is always marred by negation. B. Can’t We Call Everything “Queer” and Call It a Day? A quick answer to this generational dilemma could be to dust off the catchphrase “queer” and label our attempt to articulate new and inclusive subjectivities as simply “queer.”172  In popular usage, queer has been in-creasingly deployed as hip shorthand for LGBT issues and people—particularly those that push the cultural envelope.173  Although the non-category “queer” offers a potential vantage point to explore commonalities and differences with respect to gender and gender identification, queer theory may ultimately be ill-equipped to respond to certain transgender legal and political demands. The anti-identity coalition building of Queer Nation and the alternative positionalities envisioned by queer theory emerged from the turbulent HIV/AIDS activism associated with those dreadful years when the epi-demic was unchecked and the government and the world seemed indiffer-ent to the loss of gay lives.174  During this period, gay men and lesbians and allies began to collaborate in historically unprecedented ways in the face of a historically unprecedented sense of calamity.175  Coalitions   known that her sex assigned at birth was male.  The rape crisis center stated that its policy of retaining only female-born counselors barred the transwoman from participation.

It denies the fixity of identity which it sees instead as historically contingent and provi-sional.179  Although the original focus of queer theory was heteronormativ-ity (i.e., denaturalizing the hetero-homo binary), its multivalent gaze has been just as productively turned to the gender binary.180  An example of this would be the anti-category of genderqueer which rejects the organiza-tional imperative of the gender binary. However, the anti-identity stance of queer theory may have limited utility for some transgender individuals who strongly desire to embody a particular gender category.  In this way, queer theory may be able to ad-vance transgender issues generally insofar as it denaturalizes the gender binary, but it does not provide the space for stable identities that may be at the root of some transgender legal demands.  For example, queer theory did not construct an alternative identity to gay and lesbian.181  Instead, it offered a position against the normal or the normative—a vantage point    176.

Although informed by feminist work on gender, queer theory recognizes sexuality or sexual orientation as distinct from, although related to, gender.  Queer theory rejects feminism (i.e., gender) as the privileged site of a theory of sexuality.  Gayle S.

In turn, transgender studies challenge sexuality as the only prism through which to view gender diversity.  See Stryker, supra note 29, at 1.  178.

Queer theory offers the potential within its perspective to acknowledge the differences and distinctions related to issues or identities, such as race, gender, class, ethnicity.  Id.  Beemyn and Eliason describe this as queer theory’s potential to be inclusive of race, gender, sexuality, and other areas of identity by calling attention to the distinctions between identities, communities, and cultures, rather than ignoring these differences or pretending that they don’t exist, as it often does now.

There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers.  It is an identity without an essence.

It would simply provide an op-positional stance—a position from which to critique the binary from an outsider perspective.  Queer is the view from the margin. However, establishing a position from which one can critique the bi-nary does not necessarily enable one to live within it.  As established ear-lier, the post-feminist critique of gender largely ignores the real life impli-cations of the binary, whereas genderqueer evinces a choice to live outside the binary.  Both overlook the pragmatic and urgent demand from some transgender individuals for a particular kind of gender legibility.183  Going forward, coalitional theory and alliance building must allow sufficient room for gender self-definition that includes a choice to move within the gender binary and not simply to choose to exit from it.  When pushed, queer theory will concede that stable gender identities can be transgressive where they are affirmatively chosen and crafted in defiance of assigned gender.184  However, this begrudging concession underscores the short-coming of queer theory—not all transgender individuals have a desire to be transgressive.  To the contrary, some would argue that they are not en-gaged in an act of self-definition as much as one of self-recognition.185  Their actions are not repudiating their gender assigned at birth but rather confirming the gender that they have always been.186  For these individu-als, queer theory may be of limited usefulness, as they would not satisfy its prerequisite for stable gender recognition because they do not report a de-sire to subvert the prevailing paradigm. When queer theory examines the hetero-homo binary, its goal is to de-stabilize the categories of heterosexual and homosexual and denaturalize heteronormativity.187  The system of sexuality itself is not contested—only    182.

Assuming we recognize that individuals should have the ability to define themselves as either outside or within the binary, then the gender system itself is put into play—not sim-ply its regulation and ordering.  The critique extends beyond the construc-tion of stable gendered subjects and the question of whether there can be man without the oppositional (or complimentary) category of woman.  The disruption goes to the fact of gender, rather than to the content of the gen-der system.  If an individual is no longer inextricably bound to the gender assigned at birth, what does it mean to say someone is a man or a woman?  What does it mean to say that someone is neither?  Can someone be both?  How do we account for the multidimensional nature of gender self-definition? Gender is assigned at birth in response to specific visual or physical cues, and there is a considerable body of scholarship regarding the physical markers of gender that inform the assignment of gender.189  Commentators generally point to six different physical measures of gender that precede the gender assigned at birth or gender of rearing.190  These measures are: (1) genetic or chromosomal sex; (2) gonadal sex (reproductive sex glands)—testes or ovaries; (3) internal morphologic sex—seminal vesi-cles/prostrate or vagina/uterus/fallopian tubes; (4) external morphologic sex (genitalia)—penis/scrotum or clitoris/labia; (5) hormonal sex—androgens or estrogens; and (6) phenotypic sex (secondary sexual fea-tures).191  Gender assigned at birth is typically considered the seventh measure of gender followed by the eighth and last measure—gender iden-tity.192 This breakdown of gender emphasizes the various physical attributes associated with gender.  It is often used to argue that gender classification is potentially very complex and, therefore, assignment at birth may be later contradicted by other physical characteristics.193  Although this observation reveals the assignment of gender at birth to be an imperfect science, it con-tinues to privilege the scientific or objective assignment of gender.  Of the eight listed measures of gender, only one—internal gender identity—goes to the question of gender self-definition.  An individual’s gender identity is her/his strong internal sense of either being male or female.194  However,    188. See, e.g., Rubin, supra note 177.  189.

Thus, when we speak of gender self-definition, it must include room for gender expression and gender em-bodiment consistent with gender identity. This form of gender articulation and self-definition can be particularly difficult and, indeed dangerous, when it contradicts gender assigned at birth.196  As explained in section C below, one way to address this is to provide legal recognition for the right to gender self-definition.  The law recognizes an individual’s gender assigned at birth and generally will only sanction gender reassignment where the individual has taken specific physical steps to alter her/his gender embodiment.197  The inability to se-cure legal gender markers that conform to an individual’s internal gender identity can greatly increase her/his vulnerability to transphobic violence and discrimination, particularly when gender expression and/or embodi-ment do not coincide with her/his gender assigned at birth (i.e., her/his legally recognized gender).198 The multidimensional nature of gender self-definition directly impli-cates our understanding of the categories of heterosexual and homosex-ual—two instances where gender remains a defining factor.199  Indeed, much of the resistance to transgender issues in the gay and lesbian com-munities has focused on controlling the definition of the identity classifica-tions of gay and lesbian to the exclusion of transgender realities.  Just as heteronormativity naturalizes cross-gender (i.e., heterosexual) desire, the gay and lesbian communities assume homosexual desire as a threshold requirement for group membership.  In both cases, the hetero–homo dis-tinction rests on a fundamentally one-dimensional understanding of gender that assumes gender is determined by assignment at birth.  Accordingly, the hetero–homo distinction becomes much more difficult to articulate if gender definition is seen as multi-dimensional.  For our purposes, it is in-structive to consider four points of gender definition.  The first point is the    195. Nataf, supra note 15, at 445.  196.

The other three points all involve questions of gender self-definition: inter-nal gender identity, gender expression, and gender embodiment. What does it mean to say that one experiences homosexual desire when we acknowledge these four different points of gender definition?  What does it mean to say that one is a lesbian?  Is self-identification as a lesbian sufficient or is there a lesbian litmus test?200  Must all four points of gender be in congruence for both the subject and the object of the subject’s desire?  What about the transwoman who post-transition identifies as a lesbian?  To some feminists, the transwoman cannot be a lesbian because her gender assigned at birth was not female and, therefore, she was not a “womyn born womyn.”201  Where does this leave the transman who was “womyn-born,” but has transitioned and now identifies as male or perhaps has always identified as male?  Has he ceased to be a lesbian and, if so, when?  Is his desire for someone who is a congruent female on all four gender points considered heterosexual?  Would we say that the transman was a gay man if he were attracted to someone who is a congruent male on all four gender points?  What about someone who was only male on three gender points?  Two?  What about transmen who are primarily attracted to other transmen?  Shifting the focus for a moment, what happens to your sexual identity if your partner transitions?  What about someone who is a congruent female on all four gender points, but her husband who was as-signed male at birth transitions to female?202  What about the congruent woman whose female assigned at birth partner transitions to male?  If the relationship continues, is it still a lesbian relationship?  What if the partner reports he always identified as male?  If so, was it ever a lesbian relation-ship? Personally, I have always thought that the category of lesbian was rather confining.  Carved out from the umbrella term “gay” in order to un-derscore the different needs and obstacles facing women, the “L” was eventually moved to the front of the “G” in order to remedy what was per-ceived as the silencing of women’s voices and their contributions within the gay liberation movement.203  I chose to self-identify as a “lesbian” largely for the ease of political and social legibility, as opposed to an inter-nal sense that it conveyed any essential truth about my nature.204  With the    200.

My self-inclusion in the group did not instill me with any great sense of belonging, and I was hard-pressed to identify a point of commonality that I necessarily shared with all other self-identified lesbians.  The best I could say was that we shared the same historical context where same-sex libidinal object choice carried great social meaning and, as a result, a spe-cific set of expectations and/or disabilities could be imposed on me by vir-tue of my self-inclusion in the category of lesbian.205  Despite my personal unease with the identity category “lesbian,” no one has ever questioned whether I had the bona fides to qualify for group membership.  There could be a debate over whether I was a “good” lesbian, but that determination relates to how I perform my lesbianism not to whether I was a lesbian.  Today, a transwoman who self-identifies as a lesbian is often presented with a threshold challenge that goes directly to whether she can be a les-bian. As a result of my abiding skepticism regarding stable lesbian and gay identities, I have always preferred to use the descriptive term “same-sex” in lieu of the L, G, and B.206  This means that I have written in the past about “same-sex relationships” and “same-sex desire.”207  I did this be-cause I thought the construction was more accurate.  It included individuals who would not necessarily self-identify as L, G, or B.  It also shamelessly underscored the sexuality that was often obscured by adjectives like gay or lesbian.  I wanted to write about same-sex relationships and same-sex de-sire, not those mythical creatures called gay men and lesbians.208 In retrospect, my prior scholarship was exclusionary in that it left no room for specifically transgender experiences.  Beyond that, it now seems to have been built on an internal incoherency.  With the integration of transgender narratives and the acceptance of transgender truth claims re-garding the lived experience of gender, what does same-sex mean?  Does same-sex desire only occur when all four gender points are in convergence for both object and subject?  Or does scholarship on same-sex desire pri-marily concern the social meaning of same-sex desire, in which case the determining measure would be the external perception of the desire?  In other words, a transman who is in a relationship with a congruent four    205. BUTLER, supra note 23, at 140–41.  206. See, e.g., Nancy J.

Perhaps same-sex desire is funda-mentally unknowable because one of the points of gender definition is in-ternal gender identity?  Or is gender simply a positive command of the sovereign in which case same-sex desire is defined ultimately by reference to the legal status of the participants?  In this case, the transman who had not changed his gender markers would still be legally female and, there-fore, his relationship with a four point congruent man would be considered heterosexual. The recognition of different points of gender definition opens up con-siderable space to explore a host of non-normative relationships and de-sires that would not otherwise fall within the category of same-sex desire.  It may also expose degrees of heterosexual desire in relationships that oth-erwise would have been identified as same-sex relationships.  For example, assume a relationship between two individuals who were both assigned female at birth.  What does it mean if one of the partners is a four point congruent female but the other partner has a gender expression that is male or even an internal gender identity that is male?  Does this make the rela-tionship a little bit heterosexual, say seventy-five percent homosexual and twenty-five percent heterosexual?  What if one of the partners identifies as genderqueer?  Can there be a homosexual relationship if one party does not identify as a gender? Indeed, if each one of us truthfully takes a gender inventory of her/himself and her/his partner (or desired love object), how many of us would score one hundred percent heterosexual or one hundred percent ho-mosexual?209  How many of us would find all four points of gender defini-tion in congruence for both partners?  In addition to (or as a result of) each of us being a little genderqueer, perhaps we are all just a little bit queer? C. Legal Reforms I have previously advocated the production of a “scholarship of articu-lation” where both commonalities and differences are recognized and spo-ken.210  The incorporation of transgender realities and experiences will no doubt further this goal as it will not only complicate, but also enrich future scholarship regarding gender and sexuality.

In the case of transgender individuals, this means that we must address the ever-present threat of violence and the legal barriers to gender self-definition and agency.211 Part II.A notes that gender legal reforms have addressed the two main points of friction experienced by non-transgender individuals—gender role expectations/stereotypes and the regulation of same-sex relationships and associated sexuality.  In both instances, legal reforms have made signifi-cant steps toward the formal elimination of gender-related bias.212  The prohibition against discrimination on account of sex has even been ex-panded to include non-normative gender expression.213  In the case of same-sex relationships, marriage remains out of reach for federal purposes as well as in the vast majority of states, but many of the other legal dis-abilities imposed on account of the gender of one’s partner have been re-moved.214  There can be no doubt that such legal reforms have been ex-ceedingly important and have greatly enhanced many lives. These reforms have largely ignored transgender identities with the ex-ception of some courts and legislatures, which have extended anti-discrimination protection and hate crimes sentence enhancement to include gender identity and gender expression.215  On a fundamental level, these reforms failed to address transgender concerns because they failed to ques-tion the underlying primacy of the gender system and its reliance on the physical measures of gender.  Accordingly, in addition to promoting non-discrimination norms, the next generation of legal reforms must grapple with ways to recognize gender self-definition and provide transgender in-dividuals with an elemental level of security that is currently absent.  Transgender individuals need access to identity documents that do not con-tradict or place into question their articulated gender self-definition.  In today’s security-conscious society, many transgender individuals lack the    211. See infra note 221 (discussing prevalence of violence).  212. See supra text accompanying notes 42–43.  213.

Like most non-trans-identified individuals, I generally go through my days blissfully unaware of the number of times that my gender is read by acquaintances, strangers, and officials of the state.  For example, in Philadelphia the monthly pass for the local transportation system (aka “TransPass”) loudly declares the holder as either F or M with a large color-coded sticker affixed at point of sale.217  I don’t worry that a police officer is going to accuse me of using a stolen TransPass because s/he concludes that my gender expression does not conform with my F sticker.  I do not think twice when I enter sex-segregated spaces, such as a public restroom.  Nor am I cognizant of all the different legal documents that report my gen-der as an essential part of my official legal identity: driver’s license, social security records, voter registration card, birth certificate, passport, or bank records.218   To the contrary, a transgender individual can be subject to ridicule, harassment, and violence when her/his gender expression and/or embodi-ment does not match her/his legal gender.  While attempting to traverse sex-segregated public spaces, s/he can be denied services, provided ser-vices in a gender-inappropriate space, and reported to (and arrested by) the police for being in the “wrong” place.219  The ubiquitous public restroom is the most familiar form of sex-segregated public space.  No doubt, we have all experienced the anxiety produced by a frantic search for a public rest-room when one is needed and none appears on the immediate horizon.  This anxiety is markedly different if, in addition to finding a public rest-room, you then have to assess the risk associated with your choice of which restroom to enter.220  Transgender individuals report considerable distress over restroom issues, and it is easy to see how denial of safe and reliable    216.

These spaces include homeless shelters, domestic violence shel-ters, foster care facilities, and correctional facilities.222  In this way, the burden of the gender binary can be said to disproportionately fall on the most vulnerable segments of our society.223  Even for the privileged, con-tradictory identity papers can produce difficulties in a wide range of unex-pected venues.  For example, a confrontation with a transphobic state actor can run the gamut from a life saving/life threatening encounter with a po-lice officer or emergency medical technician to bureaucratic torture ex-acted by a clerk at the motor vehicle office.224 Air travel is an excellent example of a normal everyday activity that can produce considerable stress and discomfort for transgender individuals.  Although we may gripe and complain about long lines and the futility of putting our toothpaste in a clear Ziploc bag, the general public has largely accepted the enhanced security measures as part and parcel of post-September Eleventh reality.225  However, for transgender individuals, these    221. In 2001, the San Francisco Human Right Commission conducted a large scale survey regarding transgender issues of bathroom safety where fifty percent of trans people reported that they had been harassed or assaulted in a bathroom.  See S.F. HUMAN RIGHTS COMM’N, GENDER NEUTRAL BATHROOM SURVEY (2001), available at http://www.transgenderlawcenter.org/pdf/sbac_survey.pdf.  The most common form of harassment is questioning by police or security guards.  Id.  For trans people who are also poor or homeless and must rely on public bathrooms, the inability to use a public bath-room without fear deprives them of a place to meet the most basic of human needs.    222. Trans people are disproportionately represented in the homeless population.  See THE NATIONAL GAY AND LESBIAN TASK FORCE, TRANSITIONING OUR SHELTERS (Dec. 15, 2003), available at http://www.thetaskforce.org/reports_and_research/trans_homeless.  Most homeless shelters in the United States are segregated by sex.  Id.  This segregation has proven unsafe for transgender persons who are provided services based on their sex assigned at birth, rather than on their gender identity.  Id.  In addition, transgender youth in foster care or juvenile detention face a number of disabilities, includ-ing access to medical care, autonomy regarding dress and expression, and safety issues in sex-segregated facilities.  See, e.g., Doe ex rel. Pumo v. Bell, 754 N.Y.S.2d 846 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2002) (holding N.Y. Human Rights Law required reasonable accommodation for minor in foster care).  223. Prisons raise questions of both physical safety and access to medical treatment.  The only U.S. Supreme Court case to discuss transsexuality involved an Eighth Amendment claim of cruel and un-usual treatment where prison officials placed a transwoman in the general male prison population, and she was savagely beaten.  See Farmer v. Brennen, 511 U.S. 825 (1994) (describing transsexuality as “[a] rare psychiatric disorder in which a person feels persistently uncomfortable about his or her ana-tomical sex, and who typically seeks medical treatment, including hormonal therapy and surgery, to bring about a permanent sex change”).  224. A 2002 survey conducted in San Francisco revealed a large percentage of respondents experi-enced harassment at the hands of police officers.  See TRANSGENDER L.

This seems unlikely in the short-term as the law has given no indication that it intends to move in the direction of gender blind-ness.  The controversial Federal Real ID Act of 2005, which set forth uni-form rules for state-issued driver’s licenses and other forms of identifica-tion, specifically prescribes gender as part of the required identity data.230  Moreover, the spate of same-sex marriage legislation that has swept the United States in recent years has served to increase the extent to which gender factors into the administration of our laws.231 Short of abandoning gender, another solution would be to change the laws regarding legal gender markers to more accurately reflect the process of gender self-definition.  Currently, legal gender is assumed to be the gen-der assigned at birth.  In order to overcome this very strong presumption, an individual who wishes to change legal gender markers generally must assert that the original assignment was in error or s/he has taken irreversi-ble physical steps toward somatic gender reassignment.232  The federal government and the states have enacted different rules and regulations governing under what circumstances an individual can change which gen-der markers.233  These rules are far from uniform and present a confusing    226.

Legal gender markers are not changed to reflect internal gender identity unless an individual’s internal sense of gender is accompanied by an objec-tive physical change in embodiment.238  Although gender embodiment can be an aspect of gender self-definition, it is not an essential one.  Moreover, in the United States, access to bodily modification is heavily regulated by the medical profession.  In this way, whether a transgender individual can change legal gender markers is fundamentally a question of diagnosis—not agency. A legal gender change regime that would recognize an individual’s right to gender self-definition would allow an individual to declare her/his legal gender.  Although it is easy to imagine traditional due process or equal protection arguments asserting such a right, or even a First Amend-ment free speech argument,239 political will expressed through legislation would offer the greatest level of uniformity.  In terms of models, the United Kingdom has implemented the Gender Recognition Act which, to some extent, recognizes an individual’s right to declare her/his gender.240    people/amending-birth-certificates.html (last visited Apr. 23, 2006).

ACTION STEPS In lieu of a traditional conclusion, I think that it would be more pro-ductive to suggest a series of action steps appropriate to try at home.  As I mentioned in the Introduction, although transgender issues raise fascinat-ing questions of theory, it is imperative not to lose sight of the individuals involved who remain, to a large extent, outside the protection of the law.  Here, I have in mind our students.  For the last several years, I have served on the Admissions Committee at my law school, and we have seen a con-siderable increase in the number of applicants who are “out” as trans-gender.243  Given the generational nature of this issue, we should expect to see more transgender students going forward.244  Many of these students are coming from undergraduate schools where transgender issues are at the forefront.245  Based on our experience, I suggest the five following steps to further trans inclusion:246 1.

Amend your institution’s anti-discrimination policies to include gender identity and gender expression;247 4.  Adopt internal policies to further gender self-definition (e.g., name change rules, uni-sex bathrooms, removal of gender mark-ers); and 5.  Consider ways to include transgender issues throughout the cur-riculum. Although most of these steps are self-explanatory, I would like to un-derscore that the first step should be a program of self-education concern-ing transgender issues.  By this, I mean that you should not rely on trans-gender individuals whom you may encounter to provide you with a private tutorial.  In my experience, folks with majority identifications often do not understand how disrespectful this can be, not to mention how tedious it is for the person with the minority identification to have to explain her/himself over and over to each new and curious acquaintance.  Trans-gender individuals, particularly our students, do not exist to educate us out of our ignorance and prejudice.  We should not assume that they will carry the laboring oar on our road to enlightenment. In the 1990s, my faculty grappled with ways to integrate lesbian and gay issues through the curriculum, and many of my colleagues explained that lesbian and gay issues were really inaccessible to them.  How could they possibly learn anything about that?  Apparently, they didn’t know the first place to start.  One of my well-meaning colleagues even went as far as to suggest that, if the LGBT student groups would prepare some compre-hensive course modules, then s/he might consider teaching the material.  I remember being struck by just how foreign my colleague must have con-sidered lesbian and gay issues if s/he was willing to abdicate a portion of her/his syllabus to a group of nameless students.  We all know that law    247. It is important to have a formal commitment to non-discrimination based on gender identity or gender expression.  In the last ten years, there has been a marked increase in the number of employers with anti-discrimination policies that include gender identity.  The HRC reports that a total of 307 employers expressly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.

Self-education with respect to transgender issues will necessarily be a continuing process.  It is important to realize that the transgender commu-nities are engaged in an ongoing process of self-definition and, accord-ingly, questions ranging from legal strategy to terminology will be subject to change and reassessment.248  However, it is safe to say that there are a few basic rules.  As a matter of civility, individuals should be called what they want to be called, and we should endeavor to respect an individual’s gender self-definition.249  For example, if a student in your class asks to be called by a name different from the one appearing on your class list, it is probably not appropriate to make a crack about it in open class, as did one of my colleagues at the beginning of this past semester.250  Although we might not think twice about a throw-away comment expressing benign surprise, it can pack considerable sting to the transgender student.  It can also signal to the other students a level of disrespect for the student’s gen-der self-definition that was not intended.  As a matter of professionalism, lawyers who represent transgender individuals should educate themselves on the appropriate and preferred terminology and we should do the same in the classroom.251 Self-education starts with the recognition that, for many, gender con-tinues to carry great social meaning and consequences.  A good exercise is to spend a day trying to be conscious of every time your gender is read, requested, or acknowledged.252  The next time you walk into a public rest-room consider how that experience would differ if you could be perceived to be in the “wrong” place and you could be questioned or detained or worse.  Consider what it is like to have no place that is “right.”  Once you become aware of the continuing weight of gender, transgender issues will become increasingly obvious.    248. Spade, supra note 14, at 15 n.2.  249. For example, journalists who cover trans issues have adopted guidelines for reporting on trans-gender people.  The 2006 Associated Press Stylebook makes the following recommendation: “Use the pronoun preferred by the individuals who have acquired the physical characteristics of the opposite sex or present themselves in a way that does not correspond with their sex at birth.  If that preference is not expressed, use the pronoun consistent with the way the individuals live publicly.”  GLAAD Applauds Updated Associated Press Stylebook Entries, GLAAD, Mar. 13, 2006, http://www.glaad.org/ publica-tions/archive_detail.phd?id=3869.  250. One way to avoid this is to institute a name change policy to ensure that a student’s chosen name is reflected in her/his records and email address.  At a minimum, you can circulate a seating chart and thereby poll the students directly.  251. Carolyn Grose, A Persistent Critique: Constructing Clients’ Stories, 12 CLINICAL L.

What if homopho-bic sentiments were voiced during class discussion, s/he asked?  Wouldn’t talking about the law’s inequities make the closeted students feel worse?  I recall being astounded by this explanation, but I was moved by what ap-peared to be my colleague’s sincere agitation and apprehension.  S/he was deeply concerned that by speaking about these issues s/he would make a mistake, make someone uncomfortable, or otherwise give offense.  Un-doubtedly, s/he would at some point do all of these things, as we will when we try to integrate transgender issues into our courses and support our transgender students.  Silence is not an alternative.  It is defeat—plain and simple.  As Audre Lorde told us decades ago, “it is not difference which immobilizes us, but silence.”254    253.

For community members, the project is self-constitutive and, therefore, has an immediacy that also marks the efforts of other marginalized groups who have attempted to make sense of the world through description, interrogation, and ultimately a program for transformation. The transgender project also has universalizing elements because, existing within the gender system, each one of us embodies a particular gender articulation. It is through this articulation that we define ourselves in relation to the gender we were assigned at birth, the gender we choose, the gender we create, the gender we reject, the gender we are, and the gender we are assumed to be.\n[…]This article, written largely for an audience who does not identify as transgender, makes the case for greater inclusion of transgender issues by identifying and examining various points of resistance, outlining commonalities, and proposing action steps.
