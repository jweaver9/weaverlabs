These are the voices central to this strategy, the important voices, and the voices that must be listened to.BackgroundThe Programme for Government (2016) gives a commitment to a National LGBTI+ Youth Strategy, and the core of the Strategy was always going to be informed by the views of young people themselves. In order to realise that, the team behind the strategy set about doing two things; establishing a Youth Advisory Group running parallel to and also working with the Oversight Committee developing the strategy, and designing a consultation process that would reach far and wide across Ireland. The results in this report represent the ideas and aspirations of young LGBTI+ people and their allies expressed in their own communities, at special gatherings and online. We asked what is positive about being a young LGBTI+ person in Ireland today, what issues do they face, and what changes they would like to see. The questions were kept as open as possible and non-prescriptive. Because of that approach, this report captures a broad spectrum of attitudes, perspectives and ideas. The positive legislative landscape in the form of marriage equality and the Gender Recognition Act now forms a backdrop to growing up LGBTI+ in Ireland. The impact of this is undeniable. Positives cited by young people include such legal reform, as well as the increased visibility and acceptance of LGBTI+ people.Yet the day to day lived realities of young LGBTI+ people span so many different individual experiences. This report captures the concerns and solutions brought forward by young people. The most satisfying aspect of working on this strategy is listening to the experiences and ideas of young people. These perspectives have been surprising, revolutionary, insightful, sometimes unique to this time and place in Irish society, and sometimes identifiable as legacy issues within the community that never had the ear of a strategy such as the one the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is now developing. Everyone involved in the planning, execution, and preparation of this report has contributed to this fascinating process. The greatest appreciation is reserved for those young people who participated in the consultation process across Ireland.This document’s ultimate purpose is to inform the final strategy in a crucial way, yet it also stands alone as a snapshot of LGBTI+ young people in Irish society in the aftermath of monumental change, and fizzing with the energy and desire for more change to come.Una Mullaly Dr Katherine Zappone TDIndependent Chair  Minister for Children and Youth AffairsvAcknowledgementsDCYA would like to thank all the young people who completed the online survey and the young people who travelled to the venues to participate in the consultation.

More than two-thirds (69%) of the survey respondents identified as LGBTI+, 29% did not, and one in 10 was unsure. Nearly all (93%) of the young people who attended the consultation events identified as LGBTI+. While the young people represented nearly every county in Ireland, most spent much of their time in urban areas. In the survey, the most frequently mentioned messages on what is positive about being an LGBTI+ person in Ireland was less discrimination (mentioned in approximately 33% of responses), followed by peer support (mentioned in approximately 20% of responses) and favourable laws (mentioned in approximately 15% of responses). Similar themes emerged during the consultation events. Many mentioned the Marriage Act and the Gender Recognition Act.The most frequently mentioned messages on the issues faced by LGBTI+ people included ongoing discrimination (mentioned in approximately 50% of responses) and bullying and harassment (mentioned in approximately 20% of responses). These messages were echoed during the consultation events.Reflecting the identified issues facing LGBTI+ young people, survey respondents suggested changes including improved education, increased awareness and acceptance, changes within the LGBTI+ community, further law reform, and improved access to healthcare. Participants at the consultation events were asked to vote on the ‘positives’ or ‘changes’ they felt should be considered during the strategy development process. Most voted on changes, with the majority of votes being allocated to changes within education and training settings (31% of votes), followed by improved spaces and places for LGBTI+ people (24% of votes), improved awareness and acceptance (16%), further legal reform (13%), improved health services (12%) and changes within the LGBTI+ community (5%). The consultations focused on three questions:1. What is positive about being a young LGBTI+ person in Ireland today? (Positives)2. What issues are faced by young LGBTI+ people in Ireland today? (Issues)3. What changes would improve the lives of young LGBTI+ people? (Changes)viiThe positives of being a young LGBTI+ person in Ireland todayAn overarching theme, emerging from both consultation approaches, was one of less discrimination and an increased sense of acceptance and social support. Within this broad theme, young people described: » Positive legal reform (e.g. around marriage equality, employment equality, equal status and gender recognition legislation) » Increased visibility and tolerance (e.g. increased representation in mainstream media, increased openness) » Support from the LGBTI+ community, peers, allies, universities/colleges, and  some schools and workplaces  » Improved resources and support for the LGBTI+ community. This acceptance and support is reflected in some of the positive aspects of being LGBTI+ in Ireland, which both survey respondents and participants at the events described as the increased freedom to celebrate and express one’s identity. The issues and challenges faced by young LGBTI+ people in  Ireland todayDespite describing many positive aspects of being LGBTI+ in Ireland, survey respondents and event participants highlighted some issues and challenges facing young people that provide a sense of ongoing discrimination. The messages from both consultation approaches were very consistent.  » Discrimination and stigma Terms such as bias, bigotry, inequality, intolerance were used to describe their experiences of discrimination and lack of acceptance and discriminatory practice within employment and workplaces. Biphobia/erasure and transphobia within the wider society and within the LGBTI+ community were identified as particular concerns.  » Bullying and harassment were referenced by many, including reports of bullying and harassment across many spaces (e.g. school, workplace and social spaces) because of ineffective anti-bullying policies and hate crime legislation.  » The lack of education was a dominant theme across all consultations events, with young people describing little or no inclusive gender, sex and LGBTI+ education, and highlighting the fact that such education was delivered by staff without appropriate training. This lack of comprehensive LGBTI+ inclusive sex education, combined with poor school policies, was described as resulting in discriminatory behaviour from school staff and non-LGBTI+ peers. » Absence of gender-neutral bathrooms and problems with gendered school uniform. » Isolation and exclusion, where young people described difficulties in relation to coming out or living as an LGBTI+ young person, were described in the survey and during the consultations. Barriers to inclusion comprised poor services in rural areas and the lack of venues for under 18s to socialise. viii » Issues raised in both the survey and during the consultation indicated perceptions of generation gaps, whereby the younger generation was more accepting of LGBTI+ people than their older counterparts.  » While some young people identified family members as providing important support, problems with parents and family members were described, with the worse cases describing violence and the disowning of children by their families, resulting in homelessness and increased exposure to risk and exclusion. » Poor health and well-being, particularly mental health and a culture of drug and alcohol misuse culture within the LGBTI+ community, was identified as an issue in both the survey and during the consultation events. Other health issues raised included:The need for improved access to health services for transgender people, including access to counselling, hormones and surgery.Changes that would improve the lives of young LGBTI+ people in Ireland todayChanges to education within schools and improved training for professionals accounted for the highest proportion of mentions in the survey (50%) and votes (31%) during the consultation events. Within the Education and training theme, suggested changes included: » The introduction of mandatory LGBTI+ inclusive education in primary and secondary schoolsProvide adequate education that covers the teaching of genders, relationships, sexualities, and covers types of sex safe, consent and mental healthSex and gender education to be delivered by trained teachers and external facilitatorsTeach pupils to expect and respect difference from an early age Normalise non-traditional relationships » The introduction and enforcement of anti-bullying policies to tackle bullying  by staff and students » The introduction of school policies on gender-neutral uniforms, gender-neutral toilets and transgender policies (e.g. the use of pronouns) » The provision of support such as Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA), LGBTI+ Week, counselling, safe spaces and student staff networks » The inclusion of gender theory and LGBTI+ history within the curriculum » LGBTI+ and diversity training for all professionalsPink and purple training for teachers and school staff and governors,  for health professionals, youth workers and public servantsLGBTI+ training for parents and carers » Longer-term actionRemove religious patronage in schools and hospitalsRethink single-sex schools  » Abolish school uniforms or offer gender-neutral options.ixSuggestions to improve awareness, acceptance and inclusion were mentioned in approximately 27% of the survey responses, and received 16% of the votes in the consultation events. Some responses did not expand on how awareness and acceptance might be improved. Others referred to the need for ‘normalisation’ of LGBTI+ and the removal of ‘stigma’. Specific suggestions within this theme included: » More positive and inclusive representation in the media » More awareness training and education across society (with specific messages for improved awareness of the older generation) » Raise awareness of negative stereotypes and create more supportive environments, educate people on what is offensive and what is acceptable » Educate the wider community on gender, sexuality (e.g. bisexuality and asexuality), and non-binary issues and use of pronouns » Removal of discrimination in sport for transgender people/more inclusive sport. » As a broad theme, improved spaces and places for LGBTI+ young people received one-quarter (24%) of the votes during the consultation events. A small proportion of the votes were allocated to ‘positives’ identified under this theme, but most of the votes were directed to changes including: » More alcohol-free/quiet spaces for LGBTI+ young people to meet up in places that are not focused on alcohol or hooking up, e.g. cafés, bookshops. » More safe spaces – inclusive and exclusive spaces within the wider community and in accessible locations » More gender-neutral toilets and changing rooms » More services and spaces in rural areas and funding for trained youth workers who have a presence in rural areas » More welcoming and inclusive communities, e.g. LGBTI+ friendly town awards etc. » More safe spaces and sheltered accommodation for young people excluded from the family home.Within the survey, some of the recommendations to changes within the LGBTI+ community included improved LGBTI+ services described above.  » Favourable laws received a number of mentions within the ‘positives’ of being LGBTI+ in Ireland. However, 6% of the survey respondents and 13% of the consultation votes were allocated within this theme. Suggested legal reform included: » The introduction of clear hate crime legislation and ensure its enforcement  » The inclusion of non-binary within the Gender Recognition Act » Improved gender recognition for under 18s (especially for those whose parents are not supportive) » Simplify the process of changing one’s name, and change official forms to reflect different genders including non-binary x » The removal of the legal obstacles to adoption, fostering and surrogacy » Introduce legislation to provide gender-neutral toilets, and amend building regulations to remove the ‘three solid walls’ requirement » The introduction of more protective legislation for LGBTI+ people, e.g. make religious organisations abide by the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977–2015 » Separate Church and State. » More than one in 10 (12%) of consultation participants voted on issues and changes within the health and well-being theme. Suggestions within this theme were mentioned by approximately 5% of the survey respondents, and included:  » More inclusive healthcare for non-binary people » Overhaul the transgender healthcare system to encompass therapy, hormone therapy, surgery, speech and language services, hair removal and provision of chest binders » Ensure that all healthcare staff receive LGBTI+ awareness training » Improve access to mental health services for children, young people and young adultsTrain mental health services staff in LGBTI+ issuesProvide access to independent counselling in schoolsImprove access to statutory Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) servicesRemove the requirement for parental consent to access services » Improve sexual health servicesMore education on sexual health and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)Improved education for lesbian women or women who have sex with womenEasier access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and dental damsMobile STI services for STI testing.Respondents to the survey and participants at the consultation events identified the services offered by the LGBTI+ community to be among the ‘positives’ of being LGBTI+ in Ireland. Suggestions within this theme were mentioned in 14% of survey responses, and received 5% of the consultation votes. These suggestions included: » Improved LGBTI+ services for young people who are not ‘out’ or who are coming ‘out’, including 24/7 helpline and online support » Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) awareness training and ASD-friendly spaces  (i.e. quiet spaces) » More daytime and alcohol-free LGBTI+ social spaces (see Spaces and places above) » Challenge stereotypes within the community and address bi-erasure and transphobia (e.g. minorities within minorities) » Promote greater networking within the community, share experience and resources » Bridge gap between the older and younger LGBTI+ generations » Greater cooperation within LGBTI+ groups and between all youth and community-based groups (e.g. sports, language, culture).11. Introduction The Programme for Government (2016) gives a commitment to develop a Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) Youth Strategy. This is a key commitment for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the Programme for Government and also makes a contribution towards the Government’s broader commitment to continue to strive for full inclusion of LGBTI+ people in Ireland. Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014–2020 and The National Youth Strategy 2015–2020 provide the framework within which the strategy is being framed with a focus on appropriate measures to ensure that young people identifying as LGBTI+ are supported in achieving their full potential. The five national outcomes that we want for all our children and young people are that they:  » Are active and healthy, with positive physical and mental well-being » Are achieving their full potential in all areas of learning and development » Are safe and protected from harm » Have economic security and opportunity » Are connected, respected and contributing to their world.The National Youth Strategy identifies LGBT young people as a specific group to be considered in the context of focused provision for young people. Specifically the Strategy draws attention to the issue of homophobic bullying in schools and other settings, and this, together with family rejection, has been identified in research as leading to poor mental health outcomes in later life. A specific focus on LGBTI+ youth aims to ensure that appropriate measures are taken so that young LGBTI+ people are not in any way prevented from achieving their full potential. In December 2016 Una Mullally was announced as Independent Chair of the Oversight Committee for the National LGBTI+ Youth Strategy. The Oversight Committee (listed in Appendix One) represents a broad cross-sectoral grouping of relevant organisations, State Agencies and Government Departments and is overseeing the development of the Strategy.  A Youth Advisory Group (listed in Appendix Two) has also been established in collaboration with BeLonG To and the National Youth Council of Ireland. The group consists of 14 young people who advice on the strategy development process on an on-going basis with a particular emphasis on the youth consultation. Three representatives from the Group also sit on the Oversight Committee. The design of the strategy brand and related materials and publications has been primarily directed by the Youth Advisory Group. The Group also worked with DCYA to formulate the consultation questions which have been the focus of both the on-line and group consultation processes. 2The consultation process was launched in April 2017 with a Facebook Live event organised by young people and hosted by the Independent Chair. Both online and consultation meetings have been available as an option for young people to have their say on the priority issues that the strategy should address. The Youth Advisory Group also assisted in the planning and delivery of the seven youth consultation events which were held in different locations around the country in May and June 2017. This report presents an overview of the entire youth consultation process, presenting the key findings from the survey combined with the messages emerging from the seven consultation events. The overall consultation messages presented in Chapter 4 of this report have been arrived at following a detailed analysis of the data gathered. Chapters 2 and 3 of this report present the methodology for both approaches in detail. In addition to the youth consultation a number of stakeholder consultation elements have been built into this strategy design process. A large consultation event was held in Farmleigh House on 28th June 2017 at which almost 100 organisations were represented. This was followed up by an open call for submissions launched in early September and closed on 27th September 2017. Thirty five organisations/individuals submitted responses to this call. A situation analysis which reviews current policy, strategy and service provision, along with relevant existing data has also been commissioned to inform the development of this strategy. 32. The online survey – MethodologyTo commence the consultation process, the Oversight Committee commissioned SpunOut.ie to coordinate, develop and analyse the survey. The Youth Advisory Group worked alongside SpunOut.ie and Whitebarn Consulting1 to draft the survey questions and pilot the questionnaire. The survey used open-ended questions to explore three key consultation questions (see Box 1).  An open-ended question was also used to capture sexual orientation. A small number of closed questions were used to capture demographic details such as gender (male, female and non-binary), age, county where people lived, and the area where the respondents spent most of  their time (e.g. mostly urban or mostly rural), and whether they identified as LGBTI+ (yes, no  or unsure).Box 1: The 3 Key Consultation Questions1. What is positive about being a young LGBTI+ person in Ireland today? (Positives)2. What issues are faced by young LGBTI+ people in Ireland today? (Issues)3. What changes would improve the lives of young LGBTI+ people? (Changes)2.1 Survey promotionThe survey questionnaire was drafted in consultation with the Youth Advisory Group, which was piloted with a group of young people before a final version was agreed. The online self-completion survey was hosted on the Typeform platform. The survey, which was incentivised,2 was live for two weeks in April 2017. It was promoted heavily using a range of methods including:  » A Facebook Live event » Active promotion by the SpunOut.ie staff who appeared on radio stations such as SPIN 1038 and iRadio to discuss the survey  » A link to the survey also featured prominently on the SpunOut.ie homepage, its Twitter feed and on Facebook (with a boosted Facebook post)3  » The active promotion of the survey link by Whitebarn Consulting and SpunOut.ie and the organisations involved in the strategy development process4  » Dedicated Twitter5 and Facebook6 accounts were set up for the National Strategy support staff and each account generated approximately 500 followers/likes.1 http://www.whitebarn.info (consultant: Sandra Velthuis)2 Entry into a prize draw for a mobile phone.3 The boosted Facebook post resulted in approximately 3,000 clicks on the link.4 Whitebarn Consulting, BeLonG To, the Transgender Equality Network Ireland (TENI) and the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) also shared the survey link through their websites, Facebook and Twitter accounts.5 https://twitter.com/LGBTYouthStrat6 https://www.facebook.com/National-Lgbti-Youth-Strategy-Ireland-180942776598797342.2 Survey response rateThe survey yielded n=4,046 responses. The opening question asked which county7 people lived in. The respondents included young people from all counties in the Republic of Ireland, except Longford. More than one-third of respondents were resident in Dublin, and nearly half lived either in the capital or the surroundings counties of Louth, Kildare, Meath or Wicklow. A small number (n=22) of respondents lived outside the Republic of Ireland, and a number (n=314) were aged outside the 16–24 years age bracket. The latter two groups were redirected to the exit page of the survey, and were excluded from the analysis. Thus, the total sample of eligible responses to the survey was n=3,710.Table 1: Profile of survey respondentsCategory Sub-category %Gender* Male Female Non-binary 33 616Age* 16–17 (Under 18) 18–24 (18+) 3466Where spends most time* Mainly urban Mainly rural 6634Identify as LGBTI+* Yes No Unsure 63299Sexual identity* Heterosexual Homosexual /QueerBisexual/ Bi-curiousPansexual Asexual Unsure Other 3229277221Trans gender#Intersex#Yes Intersex 111*Base: All eligible respondents n=3,710Table 1 provides a summary profile of the respondents. Of the eligible responses (n=3,710), young people aged between 18 and 24 years constituted two-thirds of respondents (66%). Because many of the respondents in this age group had more than one place of residence, the survey also asked where they spent most of their time. 7 The 22 respondents from outside the Republic of Ireland where directed to the exit page, as the survey was not intended for them.5Just over one-third (34%) of respondents described spending most of their time in rural areas, with the remaining 66% reporting spending most of their time in urban areas. Given that two-thirds of the sample were aged 18–24 years, it was not unexpected to find a high number of young people reporting spending most of their time in urban centres, as this is where the country’s third-level education institutions are located. Predefined codes were used to capture gender. Females (61%) were overrepresented in the survey; one-third (33%) of respondents was male, and 6% of young people described themselves as non-binary.The survey deliberately sought the responses of any young people in Ireland aged 16–24, not simply those who identified as LGBTI+. Although the majority (63% n=2,328) of the respondents identified as LGBTI+, 29% did not, and 9% were unsure. Those who identified as LGBTI+ were far more likely to state that their gender was non-binary than those who did not identify as LGBTI+, and one in 10 (11%) identified as transgender, with 1% stating they were intersex. No predefined codes were used to capture sexual orientation. As a result, the responses generated a large variety of descriptions, many with qualifiers.8 The range of responses to this question provides an excellent insight into the language used by young people, and it demonstrates the complex and fluid nature of sexual orientation. For providing a profile of the survey respondents, the research team categorised the responses into seven categories:9 Heterosexual, Bisexual/Bi-curious, Homosexual10/Queer,11 Pansexual, Asexual, Unsure and Other.12 Approximately one-third (32%) of respondents identified themselves as homosexual. Two-thirds of the sample described their sexual orientation within the LGBTI+ spectrum (Homosexual/Queer 29%, Bisexual/Bi-curious 27%, Pansexual 7% and Asexual 2%). ‘Other’ and ‘Unsure’ comprised 3% of responses. It is important to note that not all respondents answered all questions.13 In both the survey and the consultation events, respondents indicated a dislike of categories. This was also reflected in the discussions about official forms which do not offer options for non-binary categories. 8 See SpunOut.ie report for fuller details.9 See Glossary in Appendix 3 for further information on each category.10 Homosexual men are most likely to describe themselves as gay, and homosexual women are most likely to describe themselves as lesbian.11 The term queer is used in many contexts and although associated more closely with some categories than others, it does not readily align with any, and it is therefore given as a unique category, but combined in the summary table.12 Used for any answers that were incorrect, unclear or could not otherwise be categorised. 13 The numbers responding (the base) to specific questions are reported within the findings.62.3 Survey analysisThe survey findings were analysed using Typeform for the initial overview, and the Dedoose software for more in-depth analysis of open-ended responses. The Wordle application was also used to create word clouds of frequently used terms.The analysis of the three consultation questions (the positives, the issues, and changes) began with simple word clouds to indicate the most common responses. The coding of predominantly qualitative survey data was not without its difficulties. Due to the size of the qualitative dataset, a balance had to be struck between capturing detail and having a manageable number of codes to identify themes. Codes were developed by sampling a few hundred responses under each open-ended question.14 These were refined as necessary during the laborious process of allocating codes to each of the relevant questions for each of the respondents. Due to the anonymised nature of the survey, it was not possible to clarify afterwards exactly what respondents meant when they answered open-ended questions; consequently, judgement had to be exercised when deciding what code(s) best matched the statement made. However, selected respondent quotes from the survey (in purple) are used throughout the report to further illustrate some of the points made. 2.4 Survey findings – Key messagesAs outlined above, the analysis of these themes began with simple word clouds to indicate the most common responses. The overriding message apparent from the word clouds was that people are the heart of everything: the highs, the lows and the solutions. Other major issues were also readily identifiable in this way, such as increased acceptance of the LGBTI+ community, especially since the 2015 Marriage Equality Referendum (positives), discrimination and bullying (issues), and education/schools (changes).Detailed coding revealed other important themes. The key points are summarised in Table 2 with approximate percentages of the references to each category. These themes are explored alongside the findings from the consultation events, and are described further in Section 4. 14 Except the questions about suggested improvements and other comments.‘If I had to label I would say gay,  but I disagree with the concept  of labels, as I feel sexuality is  a continuum.’7Table 2: Key messages on the positives, the issues and changes* Positives Issues Changes**Less stigmatisation ca.33%Peer support ca.20%Favourable laws ca.15%Increasing freedom to live authentic lives ca.10%Availability of LGBTI+ resources 10%Allies ca.3%Support from schools, colleges/workplaces ca.3%Improved sense of safety ca.3%Support from families ca.1%Ongoing discrimination ca.50%Bullying and harassment  ca. 20%Difficulties with  self-expression ca.14%Experiences in schools  (and, to a lesser extent, colleges) ca.10%Fear ca.10%Education ca. 50%Increase awareness and media representation  ca. 27%Changes within the LGBTI+ community ca. 14%Further law reform ca. 6%Healthcare ca.5 %Church and State ca. 3%Other ca. 5%*ca. approximate percentages 15** Secondary analysis of the responses to the ‘Changes’ was undertaken by Insights HSR using NVivo software to identify key themes and subthemes.15 Given the qualitative nature of responses the percentages are approximate. As respondents may identify more than one issue in their response, overall percentages exceed 100%.83. Consultation events - MethodologyThe face-to-face consultations were planned by DCYA, with support from the Youth Advisory Group. Seven consultation events were held across Ireland: Dublin (two events), Sligo, Dundalk, Galway, Waterford and Cork. 3.1 Promotion of eventsThe consultation events were published and promoted using a range of methods. Letters of invitation were sent to all DCYA-funded project as well as LGBTI+ support organisations in Ireland. The consultations were also widely promoted on social media using Facebook and Twitter, including the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) social media. The events were also advertised during a Facebook LIVE Event. A total of n=171 young people attended the events. Similar to the online survey, consultation events were attended by a higher proportion of older age groups than younger age groups (74% compared to 26%) (see Table 3 for a breakdown of participants at each event, by age group).Table 3: Numbers of participants attending each event, by age group Location 15–17-year-olds 18–24-year-olds Total Dublin event 1 (D1) 6 21 27Sligo 4 9 13Dublin event 2 (D2) 15 40 55Waterford 7 15 22Galway – 17 17Dundalk 8 14 22Cork 4 11 15Total 44 (26%) 127 (74%) 171 (100%)3.2 Profile of participantsDuring the events, the participants were asked to complete a short anonymised questionnaire. Not all participants completed the questionnaire and not all completed all questions. A total of 152 young people completed the demographic questionnaire, which included precoded questions on age, county of origin, where they spend most of their time (mainly urban/mainly rural), gender (male, female and non-binary) and sexuality (heterosexual/straight, homosexual/gay/lesbian, bisexual and other). The questionnaire had open responses for sexuality ‘other’, and how they had learned about the event.1616 At the request of participants in the first event, the cisgender option was introduced, but this was answered in a inconsistent fashion.9Table 4 provides a profile of the event participants. As all but one17 of the consultation events were promoted to LGBTI+ young people, LGBTI+ young people accounted for a large proportion of the participants. There was a slightly higher proportion of females (43%) compared to males (37%), and one-fifth (20%) of respondents were non-binary. Similar to the online survey, the majority of the young people spent most of their time in urban areas. Fewer than one in 10 (7%) participants described themselves as heterosexual, with most identifying as homosexual (41%), followed by bisexual (25%) and pansexual (13%). A small number self-identified as queer (7%) or asexual (1%). The ‘other’ categories accounted for 6% and included ‘no response’ (2%) or ‘don’t know’ (4%).Table 4: Profile of participants at consultation eventsCategory Subcategory %Gender MaleFemaleNon-binary374320Age 15–17 (Under 18)18–24 (18+)2575Where spent most time Mainly urbanMainly rural7525Sexual identity# HeterosexualHomosexualBisexualPansexualQueerAsexual/panromanticOther7412513716Transgender#Intersex#YesIntersex371*Base: n=152 #Base: n= 1173.3 Format of eventsThe two Dublin events took place on two Saturdays in May 2017; they began at 10.30am and ended at 3.30pm. The event in Cork also took place on a Saturday; it began at 10.30am and ended at 2.30pm. The consultations in Sligo, Galway, Waterford, and Dundalk were held in the evenings, beginning at 6.30pm and ending at approximately 9.30pm. Refreshments were provided at all consultations, and briefing sessions were held before and after each consultation. A professional counsellor attended all consultations and was available to provide therapeutic support if required. A member of the Oversight Committee18 introduced each event, providing a background to the strategy development process and emphasising the importance of the young person’s voice and placing young people at the 17 The first event, in Dublin, was open to all young people, including those who did not identify as LGBTI+.18 Dr Katherine Zappone (Minister for Children and Youth Affairs) and Una Mullally (The Independent Chair) also gave presentations at a number of the events.10centre of the process. Members of the Youth Advisory Group described their role in the strategy development and Oversight Committee, and stressed the importance of everyone’s individual voices. Participants were asked to be honest about their opinions, to listen to each other, and to respect each other’s viewpoints. Warm-up activities All consultation events were facilitated by trained youth participation officers. The consultations kicked off with energising icebreaker and team-building activities. The participants were then divided into groups according to age (15–17 and 18–24 years), and were briefed on the format of the consultation.Post-it notes exerciseIn their respective groups, all young people were given four post-it notes each, and were asked to write down a word or sentence on each post-it note describing the positives in relation to LGBTI+ and young people in Ireland today. All were then given four additional post-it notes and were asked to identify ‘issues’ in relation to the same. The ‘positives’ and ‘issues’ were posted on a wall. In each group a few young people volunteered to organise all the post-it notes (positives and issues) together, into common categories or themes. Having grouped the post-it notes as such, they were then transferred onto flipchart pages and titled according to the theme. The facilitator worked with the young people to identify up to four or five tablemat themes, which formed the basis of the workshop exercise. 11World Café World Café methodology19 was used to structure the second part of the consultation. The thematic category from each of the flipcharts was transferred to a tablemat. The ‘issues’ and ‘positives’ raised on the post-it note flipcharts were used to develop the discussion for each group, which was structured according to the three sections within the tablemat, namely:  » Give more detail on the positive things for LGBTI+ young people in Ireland » Give more detail on issues faced by LGBTI+ young people in Ireland » What changes will improve the lives of LGBTI+ young people in Ireland? Where relevant, young people were invited to link ‘issues’ with suggested ‘changes’ on the tablemats using arrows. Subgroups worked on a tablemat and then moved onto the next tablemat, considering the content and adding to it if they wished. This process continued until everyone present had the opportunity to work on all of the tablemats within their group.VotingIn the final part of the exercise, participants were invited to vote on the ‘positives’ or ‘changes’ they believed should be included for consideration within the LGBTI+ Strategy for Young People in Ireland. Each participant was given four votes for each tablemat. All participants circulated between the tablemats, reviewed the content of the completed tablemats, and voted on what they considered to be a priority for the LGBTI+ Strategy for Young People in Ireland. The consultation ended with the facilitators thanking everyone for their participation. Each of the consultation events was observed by a member of Insights Health and Social Research team,20 who acted as non-participant observers, documenting the process using notes and photographs. At the end of the consultations, all materials (e.g. post-it notes, flipchart pages and tablemats with votes) from the process were collated and analysed thematically. 3.4 Analysis of the group consultationsThe consultation activities generated 55 tablemats covering a range of topics, such as legal issues/rights, discrimination, acceptance/visibility, gender validation/transgender issues, schools and education, healthcare, and community supports. Table 5 provides an overview of the issues discussed. 19 In two of the events, due to the smaller numbers, a modified version of the World Café methodology  was used.20 Deirdre Fullerton or Sheena McGrellis.12Table 5: Overview of tablemat themes, by venue, by age group Venue Under 18 table theme Over 18 table themeDublin Venue 1 (D1)Society and visibilityCommunity supportsSchools and educationTalking about the issuesLegal issuesCommunity and supports EducationHopes for the futureDangers in societySligo Schools and educationSociety and its attitudesGroups and services for LGBTI+ young people and their familiesRepresentation in the mediaEducationAcceptanceCommunityRightsGalway VisibilitiesTransgender issuesLegal and healthcareSupportDublin Venue 2(D2)Talking about issuesSupportsMedical AcceptanceGender validationCommunity issuesEducation and workHealth mental/physicalSocial spaces/rural issuesLegal issuesDundalk Legal issuesEducationTrans issuesSocial perception and communitySupport and resourcesOpportunitiesAcceptanceHealthWaterford Groups and supportFamily and friendsReligion and older peopleHomophobia and stereotypesGender recognition/trans/legislationSupport services, community and familyEducation/information/awarenessDiscriminationCork PhobiasAcceptance and representationCommunication and expressionLGBT culturePolicy and legalisationEducation/awareness/acceptanceWell-being/mental health/physicalUrban ruralTotal 24 tablemats 31 tables 13The two reporters initially worked together to analyse the content of the flipcharts/post-it notes and a subset of the tablemats. The initial analysis identified eight themes, with some overlapping subthemes:  » Guidance, legislation and reform » Education » Schools » Societal change » Communities and support » Youth services and spaces » Health and medical issues » Church and StateA second level of analysis of the whole content of the tablemats, with the reporters working independently in the first instance, resulted in six overarching themes (see Figure 1). The data from the post-it notes were also summarised and used to inform the analysis. Prior to analysis – in order to maximise the transparency of the reporting – photographs were taken of all tablemats, with detailed photographs of voting patterns on each tablemat. In addition, data from all 55 tablemats were transferred into summary tables, grouped by age and organised according to each of the six themes (see Appendix 4). The tables provide examples of many of the responses within each of the themes, with voting patterns grouped by age. 3.5 Consultation events – Key findingsThe content of the 55 tablemats overlapped significantly across all sites, irrespective of the original discussion theme for the tables. The six resulting themes to emerge from the analysis reflect this interconnection, and are similarly interrelated. None of the themes stand alone, as the messages pertinent to one theme often relate to another. For example, positives noted in the Legal reform theme (e.g. the Marriage Equality Referendum) are also noted within the ‘Acceptance, awareness and inclusion’ theme. There were a number of cross-cutting subthemes; for example, access to LGBTI+ education and information and improved access to LGBTI+ services for young people were recurrent cross-cutting themes. Similarly, the role of the Church emerged as a subtheme within the Education and training, Health and well-being, and Legal reform themes. 14Figure 1: 6 Overarching themesIn order to present an overall picture of the importance of each theme, Table 6 presents a summary of the voting patterns across the two age groups grouped by theme. Appendices 6a–6f provide examples of messages within positives, issues, and changes grouped by age group and theme.

This is followed by suggestions within the Spaces and places theme, which achieved approximately one-quarter of the votes from both age groups. Changes to improve Awareness, Acceptance and Inclusion received votes from over one-fifth (22%) of the under 18s and 14% of the older age group. It should be noted that the older age group allocated approximately double the proportion of votes (15%) than the younger age group (8%) to suggestions within the Legal reform theme. Each of the themes and subthemes are described further in Section 4. 164. Overall consultation messagesIn order to present the overall messages from both consultations, the messages from both the SpunOut.ie online survey and the seven consultation events were combined and presented within the six broad but overlapping themes depicted in Figure 1. The findings from both approaches complement and support each other, adding validity and reliability to the results. Before presenting a description of the key findings by the six themes, it is important to stress that both sets of analyses highlighted the links between the themes. For example, an analysis of the code co-occurrence of the survey data21 found the strongest link between the recent changes in the law (e.g. marriage equality and gender recognition) and the perceptions of reduced stigma. There was also a co-occurrence of the availability of LGBTI+ resources and de-stigmatisation. In addition to the support offered by LGBTI+ services, respondents also described other positives to include support from peers (ca. 20%) and allies (ca. 3%), and examples of support in schools/colleges and workplaces, which play a part in providing young people with improved sense of safety (mentioned in ca. 3% of responses) and increased freedom to live authentic lives (mentioned in ca. 10% of responses). 4.1 Theme 1: Education and trainingEducation was one of the most common emergent themes in both the survey and the consultation events. For example, education was identified as a tablemat theme in all but one of the events. Changes within the ‘Education and training’ theme were specifically mentioned in approximately 50% of the responses to the survey. Analysis of the voting patterns of the consultation events found that approximately one-third of respondents (overall vote 31%; under 18s vote 35%; over 18s vote 29%) used their votes within this theme. PositivesAcross the consultations, participants described positives in terms of LGBTI+ education and training including the provision of school-based education (e.g. Stand Up, ShoutOUT) and training within third-level education (e.g. pink and purple training, Rainbow Week). In addition, a small number of young people identified examples of school support including Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA) and inclusive policies regarding uniforms. The work of the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) in advocating for gender-neutral toilets was also identified as a positive.21 How often the same codes were applied to any one respondent’s answer.17IssuesLack of education was a dominant theme across all consultations, with young people describing little or no inclusive LGBTI+ education, and gender education often delivered by staff without appropriate training. One in 10 (ca. 10%) of the online survey respondents identified problems within the school setting. Although some progressive practices were noted, the practice in many other schools included accounts of actively homo/bi/transphobic staff and guest speakers. The lack of adequate education on sexualities and genders was described by many. In both the survey and consultation events, young people described the need for education on consent and for a specific focus on mental health. Other issues identified related to the preponderance of single-sex schools, the erasure of LGBTI+ history and culture from the school curriculum, the continued use of traditional gendered school uniforms, restrictions on same-sex debs guests, and the absence of gender-specific bathrooms and changing rooms. The role and influence of the Church on what is taught or not taught in schools was a consistent cause for concern across all of the consultations and within the survey.A further issue identified during the consultations was the absence of or lack of adherence to school policies on bullying. Also identified was the need for school policies on the care and support of transgender pupils. Such policies need to include guidance and procedures on the use of pronouns. The need for LGBTI+ and diversity training for all personnel working with young people (e.g. school staff, medical staff, social workers, psychologists, sports organisations, public sector workers, including those working in social welfare/passport offices, and airport staff) was a consistent message throughout the consultations. ‘Some schools are very progressive and inclusive in their educational programmes regarding the  LGBTI+ community.’‘Education surrounding the LGBTI+ community is not consistent from school to school. This isn’t fair because it leads to ignorance in some, and those who don’t get education are seen by others as misinformed, and that’s not their fault.’‘Hearing derogatory terms being used constantly like ‘faggot’. Not being able to tell people that I am gay because of a fear of rejection … Having to pretend to be straight to fit in. Trying to accept myself for who I am … Watching my Mam change the channel because a gay person comes on TV. Having to deal with the COMPLETE ABSCENCE of LGBT education in our school system ... I have had to resort to  the internet for my sex education as it has been spoiled by a religious agenda.’18ChangesRecommendations for changes/actions within this theme reflect the challenges and barriers identified with ‘issues’. Recommendations covered strategic actions including national and local policies to ensure that young people receive education on LGBTI+ issues, and that education settings (schools and universities) are safe and welcoming places for LGBTI+ students. Recommendations within this theme include training for all professionals working with young people, including public servants, health professionals and school personnel. The dominant recommendations are listed below.  » The introduction of mandatory LGBTI+ inclusive education in primary and secondary schools » Provide adequate education that includes the teaching of sexualities, genders, relationships, and safer sex, and includes issues such as consent and mental health » Sex and gender education to be delivered by trained teachers and external facilitators‘I’d like to see more representation of LGBTQI+ individuals in the school curriculum also, particularly in subjects like SPHE, CSPE, Social Ed, etc. Sex Ed isn’t just for straight people, and it’s appalling the number of people in same-sex relationships that don’t believe they can get STIs!!’ ‘Education surrounding the LGBTI+ community needs to be standardised across the education sector in order to give all students an equal education and opportunity to be informed, regardless of the religious ethos of the school.’‘One thing I feel should change to improve the lives of LGBT+ is sex education in schools. A lot of LGBT people (more gay people than anything) think that just because they are in sexual relationships with men, they don’t need to use protection. Many people aren’t aware of unsafe gay sex, and how it can be incredibly dangerous. STDs and HIV/AIDS are becoming more and more prevalent, and this is due to the lack of education about the importance of safe sex. I feel that schools should be able to provide “LGBT sex education” and drill it into young people’s heads that unsafe sex as a gay person can be more dangerous than if they were straight.’19 » Teach pupils to expect and respect difference from an early age » Normalise non-traditional relationships » Books to include a diversity of families rather than the heteronormative families » The inclusion of gender theory and LGBTI+ history within the curriculum‘Education. I think people in schools need to be taught about LGBT+ people. Initially it is important to normalise LGBT+ families. Introducing books to young children that have diverse characters all along the gender and sexuality spectrum. I think it is then important to include LGBT+ sex education in schools from the very beginning, including all types of sex in all talks.’‘More needs to be done in schools to ensure that sex education or the inclusion of LGBTI+ is improved. Only male/female sex education is talked about in schools. This leads to many LGBTI+ people not knowing much about their sexualities or how to protect themselves in sexual situations.’‘PROPER INCLUSIVE MANDATORY SEX EDUCATION IN ALL SCHOOLS. Students must learn about all types of sexual orientations, including those which lie on the asexual and aromantic spectrums. We must teach them about transgender and non-binary people, and that it’s okay to be trans and non-binary. Sex ed should not just be “this is how babies are made, and here are some gross pictures of STDs” – which is what mine amounted to – and which my school provided in 6th year when the vast majority of students were already sexually active. Students should learn about how two women have sex, how two men have sex, and how to do it safely. Contraceptives and condoms should be free and readily available to all young people.’‘Bring LGBTI+ as part of the norm. Integrate LGBTI+ within children’s media, so that children don’t have to ask, “Why is that man holding that man’s hand?”’‘Bring the younger generations up in a way so that one day being gay is accepted universally. If they are taught in this way, this is what they will teach their children. As the generations go on, I hope that being gay is just as “normal” as being straight.’20 » A school culture that is accepting of LGBTI+ young people » The introduction and enforcement of anti-bullying policies to tackle bullying by staff and students » The introduction of inclusive school policies on gender-neutral uniforms, gender-neutral toilets, and transgender policies (e.g. the use of pronouns) » The provision of support such as Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA), LGBTI+ Week, counselling, safe spaces, and student staff networks. » LGBTI+ and diversity training for all professionals » Pink and Purple training for teachers, school staff and governors, for health professionals, for youth workers and for public sector workers LGBTI+ training  for parents and carers » LGBTI+ awareness education for ‘older generations’.‘Children learn to treat others differently, it’s not inherent. The child with two same-sex parents should not be treated any differently to a child with a “traditional” family unit, and they wouldn’t be if other children were taught that there’s nothing unusual or strange about it.’‘More support and celebration in rural areas, especially in schools. Schools should be more involved in making sure students are comfortable.’‘An outspoken anti-bullying policy that reassures LGBTQ young people of their safety, safe space in school, uniform policy for trans* people.’‘Teachers and other students must adhere to and respect  the names and  pronouns of trans and non-binary  students.’‘I think doctors also need better training on trans issues, as I would much prefer to go to the doctor (GP) with questions – as opposed to with extensive research – which they may or may not know about. I have been told that this is generally what happens when you go to the GP.’21‘Educate more teachers and educators about the best ways to support their students coming out and/or transitioning.’‘Catholic-ethos schools are a hindrance to comprehensive LGBT sex education, and to acceptance as a whole.’‘Have more “older generations”,  e.g. parents/teachers/doctors, understand and accept that when I say this is my sexuality, it is my sexuality, not yours to decide or reject. I say this and share this with you as I trust and am finding my way to feel confident with me, and for once I found something that I am very comfortable with, which is my sexuality, which is unfortunately controversial.’ » Longer-term action » Remove religious patronage in schools » Rethink single-sex schools  » Abolish school uniforms or offer gender-neutral options.There were some overlaps between this theme and the ‘Awareness, acceptance and inclusion’ theme (Theme 3) on the importance of educating the older generation and parents and carers, with some participants recommending formal education programmes for parents/carers. 4.2 Theme 2: Spaces and placesThe second theme, encapsulating the findings from the group consultations, is titled ‘Spaces and places’. This theme describes how social, youth, or cultural groups and spaces are regarded in relation to LGBTI+ lives, and how these might be improved to meet the needs of different young people across the country. Overall, one-quarter (24%) of participants at the events voted for issues within this theme, with little difference between the age groups. In the survey, approximately 14% of respondents made reference to positives and changes within the LGBTI+ community (Theme 6), which included improved spaces and places for LGBTI+ young people.PositivesBoth the survey respondents and the event participants identified various positive sources of support and resources available to LGBTI+ young people. Many youth and community groups were listed on the tablemats as positive sources of support in the lives of LGBTI+ people. Some of these groups were local or regional, others were national organisations. 22Some are LGBTI+ exclusive spaces specifically set up to support the LGBTI+ community (e.g. BeLonG To, Amach, shOUT!, GLEN), and others are LGBTI+ inclusive spaces within youth groups and organisations (LGBTI+ friendly spaces) (e.g. Scouting Ireland, Foróige, Comhairle na nÓg) (see Appendix 5 for a list of organisations and supports identified during the consultation events).Within school settings, a small number of young people described positive actions to promote inclusive spaces in schools: ‘LGBTI+ young groups and spaces.’ Older participants described positive actions within third-level institutions: ‘SU work, Pink and Purple training, and LGBTI+ societies increase visibility – feel welcome’ and ‘Third-level institutions are very progressive in terms of leading the change – e.g. trans nights, etc.’ The USI was also praised for its campaigning work to introduce gender-neutral bathrooms.Issues A significant number of respondents to the SpunOut.ie survey identified social isolation, exclusion and loneliness as an issue for LGBTI+ young people in Ireland. Around 8% of respondents included references to isolation in terms of dating and meeting other young people who identify as LGBTI+ to talk about their experiences. Some said that there is a resultant overdependence on hook up apps: ‘Grindr isn’t a good social space.’Four subthemes emerged within this theme. The first frequently expressed observations and concern that resources for LGBTI+ young people are disproportionately located in the urban centres, ‘Lack of support services in rural areas’, predominantly the Dublin area ‘Why is everything in Dublin?’. Many references were made to the lack of resources and support provided through groups, social outlets and organisations in rural areas. ‘No gay clubs in the west of Ireland.’‘BeLonG To is a support group for LGBT youth in Dublin and it’s an example of what we should be doing to improve the lives of LGBT people in Ireland. It’s a step in the right direction but the fight is not yet over – as a society, Irish people have much to do before we can truly call Ireland an LGBT-friendly nation.’‘The Pride festival is a wonderful time to join together and celebrate, but it has become more and more linked with drinking culture and it is unsafe for groups of young people to take part in sometimes. I feel like this further promotes the connection of LGBTI+ gatherings with alcohol, excluding young people and  non-drinkers.’23Many respondents were cognisant that some of the supports in urban centres are not available to all: ‘If you’re not attending college, you have no access to support.’ The second subtheme focused on concerns about the lack of alcohol-free and quiet LGBTI+ social spaces and alternative safe spaces for young people to meet rather than at night clubs or online, particularly for those aged under 18 years. Within this context a number of participants noted that many of the social spaces are perceived to be ‘hyper sexualised’ with a focus on ‘hooking up’. The need for safe spaces was also highlighted, along with the need for a combination of LGBTI+ exclusive- and LGBTI+ inclusive spaces. ‘Not a lot of options to socialise out of clubs/online.’‘No safe space for LGBTI+ that doesn’t revolve around alcohol.’‘Although I have no personal experience of this, I know LGBT+ homelessness is an issue and I feel like resources would go well to helping such individuals to stay safe and not be forced to resort to desperate measures after they have come out to their families.’The third subtheme was homelessness and the support needs of young people who are excluded from the family home, and of LGBTI+ young people who are unable to secure a tenancy in the area of their choice a result of their gender or sexual identity. ‘Trans people should be able to use their preferred toilet; gender-neutral loos cannot be formed through the removal of a disability sign, and they need to be the same as regular toilets.’Crossing many of the main themes (e.g. Education and training, Spaces and places, Legal reform) was the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms and the difficulties these gender-designated spaces pose  for young transgender people. Reference was also made to single-sex facilities within State facilities, i.e. prisons and hospitals.ChangesYoung people proposed several changes and suggestions to address the issues raised in relation to spaces and places.  » A dominant message emerging from both consultations was the need for more LGBTI+ supports and places for LGBTI+ young people to meet. Those who took part in the survey called for a greater choice of nightlife venues, but more specifically, for those not old enough to go to bars and clubs, there was a call for more daytime and alcohol-free spaces such as cafés. 24 » Rural and country-wide services was another common suggestion. From the group consultations there was a resounding call for more services, support and LGBTI+-friendly groups to be spread across the country, with ‘more things outside Dublin, and better planning of these.’ The need for the coordination and networking of services, support groups, activities, and events throughout the country was raised in many of the groups. One person suggested that ‘every county should have an LGBT youth group’, whereas others suggested that such groups should work together to increase inclusivity and resources. » A consistent message during the consultation events was the need for service providers to ensure a balance of safe spaces within LGBTI+ exclusive services and LGBTI+ inclusive services. ‘There should be less emphasis on LGBTI+ “clubs/circles/groups”. Being in a group only heightens stigma. In my opinion everyone, whether they’re straight, gay, black, white, male, female, or indifferent, should mix together instead of excluding themselves in closed circles; maybe then people will realise we are all the same, and stigma will be severely reduced, thus improving the lives of LGBTI+ young people in Ireland.’‘Not making specific groups  for LGBTI+, which creates an  “Us versus Them” scenario.’‘Try to have more services available in rural areas of Ireland (That means outside of cities and large towns).’‘Redress the balance between LGBTI+ inclusive spaces and LGBTI+ exclusive spaces. Need to feel safe but still want to be visible.’‘Readily available support groups or youth cafés where young people can meet other LGBTI+ young people and come to terms with who they are in a supportive environment. These should be available in different towns and cities and have no connection with schools, so that young people feel it is a place to relax, not somewhere that reminds them of school.’‘Do not forget rural LGBTQI+ youth!  We are here, and our communities  need to be safe for us to occupy.’25‘More rural action. People feel like they have to come to Dublin to socialise with other LGBT+ people. “The George” roadshow, where it hosts nights out in different parts of the country, would be a fantastic thing for the rural LGBT+ population.’ » Perhaps in recognition that some groups or events will only happen in cities, young people also called for better public transport to access services in urban areas. » With regard to other spaces, there was a call for safe houses for young people who find themselves homeless after exclusion from the family home. » A strong message from both the survey and the consultation events was the need for gender-neutral bathrooms and changing rooms. This was raised not only within the context of a school culture but also within the context of legal reform, in the removal of the requirement for three solid walls.  » Participants at the consultation events called for initiatives to promote LGBTI+ friendly schools, workplaces and communities. ‘It would be good if there was an LGBTQ+ group in every medium-sized/big town in Ireland, so that we could share our experiences in an open and safe space free  of judgement.’‘Lack of safe spaces for LGBTI+ young people in rural areas/lack of visibility in rural areas.’‘Supported accommodation for LGBTI+ people who have been kicked out of home.’‘Schools and workplaces should “earn” the Rainbow flag by demonstrating they are LGBTI+ friendly, with all settings that have been awarded a flag listed on a Government website.’264.3 Theme 3: Awareness, acceptance and inclusionAcross all seven consultation events, young people highlighted positive aspects of being LGBTI+. Overall, 16% of the votes in the consultations were allocated to the issue of, or changes within, the Awareness, acceptance and inclusion theme. The younger age group was more likely to allocate votes on issues to do with the need for further education/awareness compared to the older age group (22% compared to 14%). Increased awareness emerged in over one-quarter (27%) of the recommended changes in the survey responses. A significant proportion of the statements acknowledged a more visible and more positive profile of the LGBTI+ community in society in general. Increased awareness and acceptance within different settings, such as colleges/universities, some schools, sports clubs, youth groups, and within the mainstream media, were acknowledged as positive developments.A small number of participants at the consultation events and 3% of the SpunOut.ie survey respondents mentioned support from third-level institutions and employers. However, only a small number of mentions were made about schools and workplaces, with the vast majority of mentions referring to an energetic college campus LGBTI+ scene and related supports: ‘Freedom for self-expression in universities.’ In the consultation events, a number of the under 18s did acknowledge ‘slightly more acceptance in schools with teachers’ and that ‘teachers are more open about the subject’. One young person noted, ‘We have LGBT teachers.’ Pride events were also named as providing a positive platform for self-expression. Links were made between this increased level of awareness and acceptance and the ability to live a more authentic life, giving expression to one’s identity. In the SpunOut.ie survey, the freedom to live authentic lives was referenced by approximately one-tenth of respondents. This encompasses celebrating and expressing one’s true unique identity, growing as a person, and having good sex. The importance of awareness campaigns and increased representation in the media were noted across the consultation events as positive aspects of being LGBTI+ in Ireland. Links were made between the portrayal of LGBTI+ people in the media (in films and TV shows) and ‘more awareness’, greater ‘exposure to LGBT+ culture’, and ‘more openness’. ‘Very grateful for where and when I was born. I have had a very positive experience in a mostly accepting society.’‘I’m very lucky to be alive at a time when the LGBTI+ community are loved, supported, embraced –  it’s fantastic!’‘Being gay is fab.’27Recognition from public figures, from political parties, and from the business sector was also highlighted as positive and required; for example: ‘Companies being openly supportive by having networks sponsoring LGBT charities, (and) walking in Pride.’ General de-stigmatisation of people who identify as LGBTI+ in Irish society was identified in approximately one-third of the responses in the SpunOut.ie survey. The responses within this theme included increased visibility; more openness and tolerance; young people feeling more accepted and respected; being increasingly represented in the mainstream media;22 non-heterosexuality being normalised to an extent that it is no longer perceived as an issue, etc. However, this perceived increased acceptance was dependent on the setting, whereby particular settings such as school and health services were generally identified as areas in need of change.While less than 1% of those who completed the SpunOut.ie survey referred to family support as a positive element in their lives, those who did tended to rate it as very important. Similarly, while support and acceptance by family members did feature as a positive and important factor in the lives of those who took part in the group consultations, family was not strongly acknowledged in the context of increased awareness or acceptance, but recommendations to improve support from parents and families were offered by many. Of note, participants from the younger age groups were more likely to make reference to the support of parents and family. Some highlighted their support and information needs, with a particular focus on the need for information on transgender issues such as transitioning.  Support and acceptance from friends and young people who do not necessarily identify as LGBTI+ (described as ‘allies’) were rated as positive by consultation participants and survey respondents. 22 There were only a handful of references to this in the survey.‘A more progressive environment in Ireland is making it easier to come out than in past years.’‘Some older people, such as grandparents of children who  are gay, are accepting.’‘I’m in the minority, as I attend a very liberal school and I’m from a very liberal family and community of LGBTI+ people. I don’t face issues yet, anyway.’28IssuesWhile respondents reported an increase in acceptance, awareness and inclusion around LGBTI+ lives and identities, responses to the survey and consultation events identified numerous issues within this theme requiring attention. The issues identified were often the flip side of the positive aspects described above. For example, while young people acknowledged increased acceptance within society for people who are LGBTI+, they also highlighted the fact that discrimination, prejudice and stigmatisation still exist in Irish society.Overall, young people who took part in the consultations events and the survey respondents acknowledged the existence of an increasingly positive atmosphere and environment for LGBTI+ people in Ireland in recent years, with some giving credit for this to the campaigning efforts of older LGBTI+ people in years past. In the SpunOut.ie survey, the privilege of being alive in a period of tremendous cultural change was mentioned often, with many survey respondents comparing Ireland favourably to other countries, both near and far. Notably, a small number of participants at the consultation events made reference to the importance of the strategy development process and to the involvement of the Youth Advisory Group. Participants welcomed the opportunity to speak for themselves and to have their voices heard.‘Supportive policies; more policies have been developed to minimise bullying and workplace discrimination against LGBTI+ people.’‘I’m delighted that an LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy has been set up in Ireland! Thank you to all the volunteers and youth workers who do so much for all young people in the LGBTI+ community.’‘Coming out  was easy.’‘No one cares…  (in a good way).’‘The support and love from the community, being able to see older generations see what they only dreamed of for themselves come true for us younger people.’‘… the Marriage Equality Referendum was a pivotal moment in terms of wider society’s acceptance of the LGBTI+ community …’‘People think that homophobia has stopped because of the Marriage Referendum.’29Almost half of the respondents to the survey described discrimination using terms such as ‘bias’, ‘bigotry’, ‘ignorance’, ‘inequality’, ‘intolerance’, ‘judgement’, ‘ridicule’ and ‘stigma’. Such discrimination can result in bullying and harassment (mentioned by 20% of respondents to the survey), difficulties in self-expression, negative experiences in schools, and fear. Discrimination was mentioned by those who took part in the group consultations, from a general comment referring to ‘micro aggressions = subtle discrimination’ ‘to specific examples of discrimination against transgender people and LGBTI+ people who are homeless:Older generations were often described as the source of much discrimination against young people who are LGBTI+. Young people also aired this issue during the consultation groups, commenting that ‘older people just push away the subject’, that ‘elders don’t want to listen to issues about LGBTI+’ and that they ‘don’t want anything to change; they want to keep it the same.’ The role of the Church in forming the opinions and attitudes of older people was discussed during the consultation events. ‘In my experience, Ireland has become a generally supportive place to be a young LGBTQI+ person. There are a lot of supports there for those who wish to use them. However, there are still those afraid to get in contact with these supports, and those are the young people who may not be having a positive experience.’‘Violent transphobia seems to have overtaken violent homophobia.’‘Holding hands in public for same-sex couples is still frowned upon.’‘Trans people are barred from gender-specific sports.’‘Older people weren’t educated when they were young, so they don’t understand.’30The findings also suggest that bullying and harassment continues to be particularly problematic. Just over one-fifth of respondents to the SpunOut.ie survey identified bullying and harassment as an issue they have to deal with personally. In the group consultations, a small number of specific examples of bullying and harassment were recorded on the tablemats, including references to ‘abuse on the street’, ‘bullying’, ‘”fag” being a normal Discriminatory behaviour was also described as emanating from non-LGBTI+ peers and from parents and family. One participant highlighted how a young man had been ‘grounded for being gay.’ The lack of acceptance by families was linked to the loss of supportive networks, which at the extreme end amounted to children being disowned by their families or experiencing violence. Some linked the lack of acceptance by families to homelessness:‘I feel discriminated against by older people who grew up under the eyes of the Church.’‘Parents promise to protect their children, but damage them mentally by keeping them in the closet.’‘Being misunderstood by your family is the worst thing personally, because as much as they say they love you no matter what, or that they accept you, you still hear them say horrible things about other LGBTI+ people they see on the TV or hear about in the news, and you know they haven’t really learned anything and that they just make an exception for you. I worry about the future a lot.’‘So disheartening when you’re  not out and you’re still afraid and your father says, “No son of mine will be a faggot.”’‘I’m not out yet for fear that my family will reject me.’‘LGBTI+ people can be so used to getting bullied that it becomes part of their everyday life, and it’s what they come to expect. They often get mocked and treated as a joke or a freak.’31insult’, ‘derogatory terms are thrown around in public, graffitied and never covered, etc.’, and to a ‘threat of violence’. Demonstrating how double-edged many of the issues are, one young person noted how ‘increased visibility can mean increased targeting from hate crimes.’Just as some welcomed the increased freedom and ability to live more authentic lives, so many of the respondents to the SpunOut.ie survey and participants in the group consultations highlighted the problems and difficulties in doing just so.One theme that emanated particularly strongly, and not just from people who identify as such, was problems associated with bisexuality. The intolerance of bisexuality, termed ‘biphobia’, was described in many of the consultation events.Both survey respondents and consultation participants described challenges to self-expression. The process of becoming an adult is accompanied by a sense of awkwardness for most young people, but the discomfort appears to be especially problematic for young people who are LGBTI+.  Difficulties in ‘coming out’, and the pressure to do so at all/time and time  again, were referenced by many of the young people who responded. ChangesA range of changes or suggestions were made by participants in the consultation groups and respondents to the SpunOut.ie survey to address the issues raised within the theme of ‘Awareness, acceptance and inclusion’.‘Depending on where you live, it varies. I think in Dublin it is easy and my best friends are openly gay in school, but I find the attitude changes the more rural you get. The attitude I found from the young people in the Gaeltacht was quite homophobic and toxic.’‘Disbelief: “It’s a phase,” “You’re just unsure,” “Pick one.” So, which do you prefer?’‘As a young bi guy, I still find it difficult to be 100% myself in LGBTQ spaces.  I often find that LGBTQ people are even more discriminatory against bi people than people in het spaces … Bi people are still erased, discriminated against,  and misunderstood … Bisexual people were essentially being told that we could lose the Referendum. When in reality, we were part of the fight.’‘I wish straight people had to come out too.’32 » Education of the wider community (particularly older generations) for greater acceptance and for greater recognition. Specific attention to education and awareness of different sexualities (e.g. bisexual and asexual) and of non-binary and transgender people, with a specific focus on pronouns (see also the ‘Education and training’ theme).In both the survey and the consultation events, references to increasing acceptance were often qualified, many explaining that acceptance varied according to the setting and that further work is required to remove stigma, particularly for non-binary people. Suggestions for improvements are listed below. » Awareness campaigns were recommended in order to address negative stereotypes and deficits in awareness and acceptance using:The media (newspapers, books, cartoons, magazines, radio shows, television dramas, films, advertisements) to portray positive images of LGBTI+ people and to promote more open discussion on LGBTI+ issues Articles and documentaries on the human rights aspects associated with being LGBTI+ Celebrities with youth appeal (both openly LGBTI+ and allies).‘Awareness that slurs such as “faggot” are unacceptable under every circumstance.’‘Ireland has definitely made significant progress in terms of equality and inclusiveness for LGBT individuals. However, I still think it has a long way to go, particularly in relation to transgender awareness.’‘Education for an older generation to open their minds and understand LGBTI+ …  to promote understanding  of what is offensive and  what isn’t.’‘More representation in the media in which our gender or sexuality are not an anchor of the character but simply a background fact.’‘More LGBTI+ awareness spread through social media and advertising. People need to see that this is the norm now and they need to accept that.’‘More exposure in the media would be incredible! I’d love it myself if I (a transgender person) were recognised nationally as a normal person.’33 » With regard to greater inclusion within the workplace, responses to the survey suggested workplace initiatives to make recruitment processes fairer, to train staff in relevant LGBTI+ matters, and to deal effectively with bullying/harassment. » Partnerships working with willing partners such as youth mental health organisations, youth work organisations, parenting bodies, older people’s organisations, and Traveller and migrant groups to achieve the greatest impact. » Work with organisations such as the GAA and FAI to promote more inclusion of transgender people in sports. » Funding for services, and increased promotion of available services. 4.4 Theme 4: Legal reformLegislation and policy in relation to LGBTI+ rights was a specific focus of six of the 55 tablemats in the group consultations. It was referenced in many more, and it was also a key theme in the SpunOut.ie survey findings. The older age groups were more likely to discuss legal reform than the younger group, and the older age groups allocated more votes to this theme than their younger counterparts (the older age group allocated 15% of their votes, whereas the younger group allocated 8% of their votes).PositivesThe Gender Recognition and the Marriage Acts were noted as positive things for young LGBTI+ people in Ireland today. These changes to the Constitution were recognised by both age groups as progress, as affirmation of their identity within and by the country, and as facilitating their self-expression and ability to live authentic lives:‘Raise awareness of negative stereotypes and create more supportive environments.’‘People need to know that they will be loved and accepted.’‘More signposting to services.’‘Marriage equality, giving people the courage to express themselves.’‘The “Yes” campaign made us feel accepted. Tiocfaidh Ár Grá.’‘Feel more hopeful for our futures, as we can get married, and it makes adoption easier.’‘Ireland is ahead in LGBT laws.’34Similarly, the SpunOut.ie survey findings reported that increasingly favourable laws were mentioned by ca. 15% of respondents. The vast majority of these referenced the Marriage Equality Referendum vote, and many were keen to point out that this was passed by popular vote as opposed to being a Government decision. The fact that homosexuality is legal was also mentioned, along with employment equality, equal status and gender recognition legislation. During the consultations, particular attention was given to the Gender Recognition Act. Some acknowledged the positives of the introduction of the law, but many identified its limitations. Issues The limitations of the Gender Recognition Act constituted many of the issues and changes for this theme.Participants at the consultation events highlighted the limitations of the Act for non-binary people and for young people aged under 18 who required parental consent to change gender. Without formal acknowledgement of non-binary people within the legislation, non-binary people experience considerable difficulties as they are not recognised in legal documents. Some felt that this created further discrimination for non-binary people.The issue of discrimination in employment was also raised. Some of the discussions focused on how religious institutions interpreted  the law: ‘Non-binary people  do not exist according  to the law.’‘Section 37 of the Employment  Equality Act allows for discrimination by providing grounds for discrimination based on religious ethos.’‘Outlaw job discrimination (you can’t turn away a person because they are gay and you cannot use another excuse for blatant discrimination in the workplace).’‘Discrimination in  regard to outside  the binary.’‘Under-16s not being able to change their gender marker.’‘Gender Recognition Act: anyone over 18 can change gender, and anyone aged 16–18 can change gender with parental consent.’35About 2% of respondents to the SpunOut.ie survey referred to discrimination in employment, namely the increased difficulty in gaining employment and the risks associated with expressing one’s identity at work.Related to discrimination and bullying, the absence of clear hate crime legislation was  also a strong message within this theme. A number of participants at consultation events raised the need to repeal  the Eighth Amendment, as this has implications for LGBTI+ people’s  (particularly bisexual and transgender people’s) access to healthcare. Throughout the consultations, reference was made to the needs of young people living in abusive homes or who have been excluded from the home, and their needs for social welfare and housing. ‘Lack of inclusivity in the workplace; you feel like you should hide it.’Bullying/harassment, both  from co-workers and  from management.‘Homophobic/transphobic/biphobic language not taken seriously in work and education settings.’‘Anti-discriminatory laws are  not enforced.’‘No hate crime legislation.’‘The Eighth Amendment affects trans males and non-binary people.’‘The age rates in the Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) are silently discriminatory against LGBT youth. Youth are unable to move out of abusive households or are forced to stay closeted because they cannot afford to move out.’‘Legal recognition of non-binary genders. Better government-mandated education on LGBTI+ sex, sexualities and gender identity. An easier process needs to be in place for young people looking to change their gender identity legally, and rules should be set in place as to how to deal with young people who do not have supportive parents.’36ChangesThe changes suggested by participants and survey respondents reflected many of the issues described in the previous sections, and are listed below.  » A number of participants at the events commented on the need for equality to be ‘managed’. Suggestions for this included the appointment of an ombudsman for LGBTI+ people, having LGBTI+ seats in the Seanad, and creating and enforcing  anti-discrimination laws.  » There was a call for employers, and religious organisations in particular, to adhere to the anti-discrimination laws.  » While the Gender Recognition Act and the Marriage Equality Referendum vote were included as positives, amendments were suggested to the Gender Recognition Act to acknowledge transgender and non-binary people. Suggested changes included legal recognition for titles such as Mx and Mz, and to include more options on forms other than ‘male’ or ‘female’. A number of young people called for amendments that would make it easier to legally change their name or gender. » While participants acknowledged the importance of existing laws in place to address discrimination and hate crime, young people in the consultations also called for their extension and stricter enforcement so that hate crime legislation, for example, could be enacted and extended to include trans people and those of non-binary identity, and anti-discrimination laws could be reformed to include trans people.  » A number of other issues were identified in the consultation exercise as things that needed to be changed or addressed within the context of the law or policy reform. Gender-neutral bathrooms was one of the most voted-on issues, and noted significantly more often by those under 18 (see also the ‘Spaces and places’ theme). ‘Make it easier for trans people to change their name legally.’‘Gardaí should enforce incitement to hatred.’37 » A few who took part in the consultations called for a change to the law that would allow young people to access mental health services without parental consent. » Although mentioned by less than 1% of respondents to the survey and raised by a small number of the event participants, some very real concerns were expressed about LGBTI+ people’s future ability to have children. Restrictive surrogacy and adoption laws, few babies available for adoption, and the high costs of both surrogacy and adoption were all mentioned.  » Discrimination of LGBTI+ people, in particular trans and non-binary people, was regarded as limiting their life options (via restrictive opportunities for employment, benefits, housing, education, etc.). Thus, action was required to address all discrimination and ensure that LGBTI+ people have equal opportunities. 4.5 Theme 5: Health and well-beingHealth emerged as a tablemat theme in five of the 55 tablemats. However, themes related to health and well-being emerged in a number of other tablemats such as legal issues, as well as transgender issues and rights. The health and well-being theme has four subthemes: general healthcare, sexual health, mental health, and transgender health and well-being issues. As a whole, issues related to health and well-being secured 12% of the votes. PositivesIn terms of the positives within this theme, participants noted access to transgender health services, identifying support services for transgender people (e.g. TENI, Bi-Ireland), improved access to endocrinology services and ‘expansion of urban endocrinology services’. Participants also identified sexual health services such as GUM services and Rapid HIV testing in LGBTI+ settings (e.g. PantiBar and Teach Solais). ‘Update legislation to make it easier for establishments to create ungendered bathrooms (i.e. get rid of the “3 solid  walls” rule).’‘Make it legal for children from the age of five upwards to avail of counselling, be it in Pieta House or CAMHS. It is impossible for teens without parental consent to avail of counselling.’38IssuesDeficits in the health services were identified across all of the consultation events, and to a lesser extent in the responses to the survey. One main concern was non-binary people’s access to health services: ‘The health system is very reliant on binary systems.’ Three main issues were identified regarding health and well-being. The first issue was access to sexual health services, including the need to have easier access to STI clinics, dental dams and PrEP. Many felt the 1 year ban on blood donations from MSM was too long and should be reduced. The need for education about the risks of unprotected sex for all, including women who have sex with women, was also raised.The second issue was the need for improved health services for transgender people. Concerns included the requirement for parental consent for under 18s, the long waiting times, and the lack of adequate information and resources on trans issues. The need for improved access to services for transgender people included improved access to counselling, hormones and surgery. The third issue raised during the consultations was the need for improved mental health services. As drug and alcohol misuse is high among the LGBTI+ community, many felt there is a need for improved early intervention and easy access to services. ‘Bad coping mechanisms to deal with exclusion, e.g. alcohol use, drugs and other substances.’‘Addictions are higher in the  LGBTI+ community.’‘The blood donation policies regarding men who have sex with men … also anger me.’‘There is very little Irish-focused information available for trans young people, their friends, and their family … Schools are not required to respect a student’s gender identity … Legal gender recognition is not accessible ... the system for medical transition in Ireland is dismal … Medical and legal transition costs money … If your parents don’t care about you being trans, you cannot access these things.’39Within this theme there was also a call for improved staff training. A number of participants at the consultation events identified the role of the Church in the provision of hospital-based care to be a cause of concern.ChangesThe suggested changes under this theme responded to the specific issues identified above. Overall, there was a call for more inclusive health services staffed by personnel who have received training in LGBTI+ issues. Particular calls were made for inclusive services for non-binary people.  » Make services inclusive for all, including non-binary people » Overhaul the transgender healthcare system to encompass psychological therapy, hormone therapy, surgery, speech and language services, hair removal and provision of chest binders:Shorten waiting times and create better communication channelsIncrease options to avail of HSE funding for surgery abroadHSE cover for hormones (if not already available)More gender identity clinicsEnsure all service providers are trained in transgender issues » All healthcare staff to be provided with LGBTI+ awareness training » Particular attention should be given to providing mental health services  for children, young people and young adults.‘Introduce a less convoluted system to get trans people hormone therapy and top surgery, etc.’‘As a teenager, hiding my sexual orientation contributed to me suffering from depression and severe anxiety, which I still struggle with today.’‘I have been lucky, but every LGBTI+ person I know has suffered mental health issues. We need greater support, and the general public needs to be educated so that traditional views and values will cease to be an issue for LGBTI+ people in the first place.’‘Counselling should be available for everyone for prevention of depression. There should be trained counsellors in schools  (not guidance counsellors).’40 » Improved sexual health servicesMore education on sexual health and STIsEasier access to PrEP and dental damsImproved education for lesbian women or women who have sex with womenMobile STI services for STI testing.4.6 Theme 6: LGBTI+ communitiesThe final theme is titled ‘LGBTI+ communities’. This theme encompasses the support offered by the LGBTI+ community. While issues within this theme are integrated within all of the other themes, a number of messages emerge for change within the community. PositivesOverall, participants provided many examples of the support offered by the LGBTI+ community. Throughout the consultation events, specific references were made to the services and support offered by organisations such as BeLonG To, TENI, Bi-Ireland, Lesbian Line, GLEN, and Pride. There were a number of mentions of online supports including SpunOut.ie ‘Internet community’. ‘A lot of good work being initiated with young people  in the LGBT community.’‘I think young LGBT people should be educated on sexual health matters. I feel sexual health is very much brushed under the carpet when it comes to LGBT people, especially in schools where they mostly just teach about heterosexual sex. I feel this puts young LGBT people at a high risk of STIs, as they are not educated on safe sex.’‘Legalise PrEP.’41IssuesIn the survey and at the consultation events, a number of young people made reference to exclusion within the community. This included, for example, the perceived exclusion of religious or more conservative young people, women, and those not wishing to label themselves. Throughout the consultation, biphobia and transphobia was identified as a problem within the community, highlighting the perceived lack of acceptance of BTI+ within the LGBTI+ community itself. One participant presented this simply as LGBT.A small number of respondents highlighted specific needs of the community, for example, the need to become more autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) friendly by providing ASD training, and offering ‘quiet spaces’. ChangesWhile many young people acknowledged the achievements of the LGBTI+ community (particularly the work of BeLonG To, SpunOut.ie, and ShoutOut), a number identified the need to continue to work to improve the services and supports available to all young people. Some of the recommendations for improved LGBTI+ services have been described within the ‘Spaces and places’ theme. Other recommendations are listed below. As follows:  » Improved LGBTI+ services for young people who are not ‘out’ or who are coming ‘out’support for young people experiencing bullyingsupports tailored for different subgroups under the LGBTI+ umbrella24/7 helpline and online supportsupport for parents/family more daytime and alcohol-free LGBTI+ social space‘Ability to meet people  with the same experience  as yourself, and sexuality  and gender as you.’‘Have been discriminated against, marginalised, intimidated, abused and even assaulted for my sexuality by peers, strangers, business owners and family members … erased, ignored and ridiculed time and time again by the nearly all media, by homophobes, allies and members of the LGBT community alike. Bisexuals more than any others … are considered to be confused, lying, seeking attention, unfaithful or promiscuous beyond conscience.’‘Meeting other LGBTI+ young people.’‘Be yourself with them.’42 » More promotion and advertising of available services to widen the reach  of all supports  » More celebratory ‘inclusive’ initiatives, such as picnics, arts festivals, commemorative days, etc.  » Address bi-erasure and transphobia within the community  » Bridge gap between the older and younger LGBTI+ generations » Challenge stereotypes ‘I know my friend who has recently come out as trans needs a lot of help, especially after his parents and extended family didn’t accept it at all. If there were any clubs or meetings or something that he could go to meet with other people from the LGBT+ community, I know that he and all my friends and myself would love it.’ ‘The issue is in the hands of young LGBT people themselves. How they carry themselves creates poor stereotypes for us to be globally judged for. Thankfully, me and my boyfriend avoid these stereotypes, and people are shocked when they find out about me. But if people could realise that being gay or whatever is just a little bit of biography, just a feature, like having black hair  or blue eyes, then we wouldn’t have such ostracisation in society.’‘Do not forget rural  LGBTQI+ youth! We are here, and our communities need to be safe for us to occupy.’‘Trans visibility/transphobia within LGBTI+ community needs to improve.’‘Bi-erasure is a major issue. While many are accepting of homosexuals, many bisexuals are dismissed by both the LGBTI+ community and by genders heterosexuals alike. This places added pressure on young bisexuals – whereby their sexuality just does not exist for people, which is very disheartening.’‘Education within the community – not just straight.’43‘The LGBTI+ community should break away from creating a predefined expectation of who and what LGBTI+ people should be, which can alienate those within the community who do not fit into these archetypes. While society may create its own right or wrong depictions of what the LGBTI+ community is, the community itself seems to cling on to certain aspects of these stereotypes and embrace them to an almost unhealthy amount of pride. Many do not fit the LGBTI+ stereotype that is being built in recent years, and are affected by being left out by their own LGBTI+ community, who see them as ‘not one of us’ or unable to ‘embrace what makes us LGBTI+.’ Being LGBTI+ sometimes breaks people off from parts of their society for being different. Their own community should never do the same. It is important to always stress that sexuality should never be confused with personality, or lifestyle. Someone who is not LGBTI+ always are given the chance to be whoever they want to be, while on the other hand, we only ever seem to give LGBTI+ people the chance to be LGBTI+, but nothing else.’‘Change stereotypes – for example, how you should look as an LGBTI+ person.’‘Not making specific groups for LGBTI+ creating an  Us v Them scenario.’‘I would like to see more LGBTI+ visibility in the arts in Ireland. I know that there is a “market” for this. I also feel that certain spaces in Dublin could be more LGBTI+ friendly. It would be great if there were more gay bars and places to hang out. But that also might be ambitious, so why not adapt what we have – making them more accepting and diverse? We should be using the growing acceptance in wider society and reflecting it in our social spaces.’ » Promote greater networking within the community, share experience and resources  » Greater cooperation within LGBTI+ groups, and between all youth and community-based groups (e.g. sports, the arts, language, culture), in order to create more inclusive communities.44‘I believe that for some, but not all, it is a case of separation. As an LGBTI+ person, I often see LGBTI+ people build a wall between those who are not part of the community. I find it is due to some LGBTI+ people’s arrogance towards others that hate can stem from this. Of course this is not always the case and in no way do I mean that people should not stand up for their right to humanity, but that in that fight you can often separate yourself from people who mean no harm at all.’‘I think they should do away with the banner of LGBTI+. If they define themselves by a political label first, and as individuals second, then people will judge them by the label, not as individuals. As LGBTI+ becomes more powerful, it will become corrupt and make enemies for itself and, by extension, for all LGBTI+ people  who do not deserve it.’45Appendix 1: Members of the Oversight CommitteeOrganisation NomineeChair Una MullallyTransgender Equality Network Ireland (TENI) Catherine CrossLGBT Helpline Paula FaganTusla – Child and Family Agency  Cormac Quinlan and Nerilee CeathaBeLonG To Moninne GriffithDepartment of Justice Equality and Law Reform Michael Duffy and Adam Egan Irish Congress of Trade Unions Fiona DunneNational Youth Council of Ireland Mary CunninghamUnion of Students in Ireland (USI) Siona CahillSport Ireland Dr Una May and Bernie PriestlyDepartment of Children and Youth Affairs Olive McGovernDepartment of Children and Youth Affairs Mary RobbHealth Service Executive Diane Nurse and Caoimhe GleesonDepartment of Education and Science  Gavan O’Leary and Gráinne MorrisseyDCYA Secretaariat  Joanne Byrne, Tina Murphy and Aibhin O’Reilly46Appendix 2: Members of the Youth Advisory GroupSeamus Byrne Lesley FitzpatrickChelsea Gibson  Amy HunterAyrton Kelly  Tara Killeen Katie McCabe Martin McDonagh Imelda Morrissey  James Murray Jay Pope  Niamh Scully Ruan Walsh 47Appendix 3: Glossary of Terms23Asexual Asexual is the term used to describe people who feel little or no sexual attraction to anyone.

    "abstract": "The consultations reached a total of n=3,882 young people from across Ireland (n=3,710 young people completed the SpunOut.ie survey and n=172 young people attended one of seven consultation events) representing a cross-section of young people, including those who identified as a member of the LGBTI+ community, and those who did not. More than two-thirds (69%) of the survey respondents identified as LGBTI+, 29% did not, and one in 10 was unsure. Nearly all (93%) of the young people who attended the consultation events identified as LGBTI+. While the young people represented nearly every county in Ireland, most spent much of their time in urban areas.\n\n\n\nThe consultations focused on three questions:\n\n1. What is positive about being a young LGBTI+ person in Ireland today? (Positives)\n\n2. What issues are faced by young LGBTI+ people in Ireland today? (Issues)\n\n3. What changes would improve the lives of young LGBTI+ people? (Changes)\n\n\n\nPoor health and well-being, particularly mental health and a culture of drug and alcohol misuse culture within the LGBTI+ community, was identified as an issue in both the survey and during the consultation events. Other health issues raised included: The need for improved access to health services for transgender people, including access to counselling, hormones and surgery",
