The Eighth Circuit Court \nof Appeals upheld a lower court desegregation decision to require continuation of programs to \nremedy educational equity issues, including racial disparities in school discipline, student \nachievement, access to advanced placement and honors curriculum and inequities in school \nfacilities within three Arkansas school districts.  Those school districts had sought to end long-\nstanding desegregation programs.  The lower court (the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas), however, released the State of Arkansas from its ongoing responsibility \nto fund over $70 million per year of inter-district desegregation remedies.  The Court of \nAppeals reinstated the state’s obligation to pay those costs.  [To read the Eighth Circuit Court’s \nDecember 28 opinion in Little Rock School District v.

DOJ announced its largest residential fair lending settlement in \nhistory in December 2011.  The settlement involved claims that Countrywide discriminated against more \nthan 200,000 African American and Latino borrowers by charging them higher fees and interest rates than \nnon-Hispanic white borrowers, in both its retail and wholesale lending.  Countrywide also discriminated by \nsteering thousands of such African American and Latino borrowers into subprime mortgages when non-\nHispanic whites, with similar credit profiles, received prime loans. The settlement also requires \nCountrywide, now operating as a subsidiary of Bank of America and not originating new loans, to \nimplement policies and practices to prevent discrimination if it returns to the lending business in the next \nfour years.

In February DOJ, HUD and 49 state attorneys general announced a $25 billion agreement, the \nlargest federal-state civil settlement ever obtained, with the country’s five largest mortgage lenders – Bank \nof America Corporation, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Company, Citigroup Inc. and Ally \nFinancial Inc. (formerly GMAC). The agreement provides immediate financial relief to homeowners by \nrequiring banks to reduce the principal balance on many loans, refinance loans for underwater borrowers \nand pay billions of dollars to states and consumers.  While the mortgage companies have three years to \nfulfill their obligations, the agreement includes incentives for relief to be provided within the first 12 \nmonths and 75 percent of target relief must be completed within the first two years.  The settlement also \nestablishes significant new homeowner protections for the future by requiring these companies to \nimplement unprecedented changes in how they service mortgage loans, handle foreclosures, and ensure the \naccuracy of information provided in federal bankruptcy court.  Oklahoma did not sign the agreement so \nconsumers in that state will not benefit from its terms.  The agreement does not preclude criminal \nenforcement actions by state and federal authorities.

DOEd released new \ndata on March 6 from a national survey of more than 72,000 schools serving 85 percent of the nation’s \nstudents.  The data, collected as part of the 2009-2010 Civil Rights Data Collection, examines a range of \nissues including college and career readiness, discipline, school finance and student retention.  Among the \nfindings are that African American students, particularly males, are far more likely to be suspended or \nexpelled from school than their peers.  While African American students were 18 percent of the students \nsampled for this survey, they represented 35 percent of students suspended once and 39 percent of those \nexpelled.  Teachers in high-minority schools were paid $2,251 less per year than their colleagues teaching \nin low-minority schools in the same district.  The civil rights data collection was begun in 1968 but \ndiscontinued under the Bush Administration in 2006.  Civil rights groups successfully appealed to the \nObama Administration to reinstate and broaden the data collection.  The data collected is separated by \nrace/ethnicity, limited English proficiency status, disability and sex.

The DOEd and DOJ released \ntwo new guidance documents detailing the flexibility that school districts and colleges and universities \nhave to promote true equality of opportunity under decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court. The guidance \nmake clear that educators may permissibly consider the race of students in carefully constructed plans to \npromote diversity or, in K—12 education, to reduce racial isolation.

It also agreed to create new procedures that ensure that thousands of non-English \nspeaking students and their families are not excluded from educational programs.  Federal law requires \npublic schools to take steps to guarantee that non-English speaking students have a meaningful opportunity \nto participate in education programs.  DOEd Office for Civil Rights will monitor compliance with the \nterms of the agreement through June 2013.  The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) originated a federal \ncivil rights complaint against the school district on behalf of Latino students.

Analysis by the DOEd of new data on \n2008-2009 school level expenditures documents that schools serving low-income students receive less than \ntheir fair share of state and local funds.  As a result, students in high-poverty schools have fewer resources \navailable to them than schools attended by their peers in wealthier school districts.

DOL’s Office \nof Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) announced on March 22 that it had entered into a \nconciliation agreement to resolve allegations of hiring discrimination by two federal contractor subsidiaries \nof FedEx.  The agreement is the result of seven years of compliance reviews at numerous FedEx facilities \nin multiple states and is the largest single financial settlement negotiated by OFCCP since 2004.  OFCCP \nenforces Executive Order 11246 which prohibits discrimination by federal contractors.  Under the \nagreement, the FedEx subsidiaries will pay $3 million in back wages and interest to 21,635 applicants, \nwho were rejected for entry-level package handler and parcel assistant positions at 22 facilities.  The \n21,635 applicants represent one of the largest classes of victims of any case in OFCCP history.  According \nto Patricia Shiu, Director of OFCCP, of the 21,635 applicants rejected for employment, 61 percent were \nfemale, 52 percent African-American, 14 percent Hispanic, 2 percent Asian and 1 percent Native \nAmerican.

On \nJanuary 25, the EEOC issued its final report on its fiscal year (FY) 2011 record:  it received a record \n99,947 charges of employment discrimination and obtained a record $455.6 million in relief for private \nsector, state, and local employees and applicants, through administrative settlements and litigation. For the \nsecond year in a row, it resolved more charges than it received, decreasing its pending cases by ten percent, \nto 78,136.  The most numerous charges received (at 37,334 or 37.4 percent of all charges) were for alleged  \n \n 4 \nretaliation under all statutes, followed closely by claims of race discrimination (at 35,395 charges or 35.4 \npercent).  Charges also increased for allegations of disability discrimination at 25,742 and age \ndiscrimination at 23,465.

A state district court in Denver, Colorado, ruled in favor of Colorado parents seeking adequate \nfunding for at-risk and English Language Learner (ELL) students under the state school finance system.  \nThe state court held that the state’s public school finance system was not “rationally related” to the state’s \nmandate to establish and maintain a thorough and uniform system of free public schools.  Instead the \nschool finance system was found to be “irrational, arbitrary and severely underfunded.”  Under the court’s \nruling, the state’s General Assembly has until the end of the 2012 legislative system to adopt a different \nand more equitable system for financing public schools.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that \nArizona’s voter registration provisions (adopted under Proposition 200 in 2004) requiring proof of U.S. \ncitizenship to register to vote violate the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA).  In a 9 to 2 \nApril 17 decision, Gonzalez v. Arizona, the court held that for federal elections, Arizona must accept, as \nrequired under the NVRA, the mail-in federal registration form or a state equivalent form, which includes \nan affirmation of citizenship by the applicant under penalty of perjury. At the same time, however, the \ncourt upheld the state’s requirement that voters show identification at the polls.  The state’s required ID \nincludes both photo ID and non-photo ID.  The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund \nand the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law argued the case for individuals involved and on \nbehalf of a number of civil rights groups. [See http://www.maldef.org/news/releases/az_voting_rights/  to read \nthe Court’s decision and for background on Arizona’s law; see also \nhttp://www.lawyerscommittee.org/newsroom/press_releases?id=0216.]     \n \nWisconsin Voter ID Law Put on Hold.  On March 6, the Circuit Court in Dane County, Wisconsin \nissued a temporary injunction against the implementation of the state’s voter ID law until a trial could be \nheld on its legality under the Wisconsin Constitution, which expressly guarantees the right to vote.  Circuit \nJudge David Flanagan called the law, “the single most restrictive voter eligibility law” in the country.  The \nchallenge to the voter photo ID law was brought by the Milwaukee Branch of the NAACP and Voces de la \nFrontera.  The state appealed the decision in Milwaukee Branch of the NAACP v. Walker (Case No. 11-\nCV-5492) to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals which, on March 28, sent the appeal to the state Supreme \nCourt for its review and determination because they believed the legal issue was essential to how the state \nfunctions and because quick resolution was necessary.  On April 16 the state Supreme Court refused to \ntake the case.  The trial before the Dane County Circuit Court to decide whether to lift the temporary ban \n \nVOTING RIGHTS \n \n 5 \non the law’s implementation or make the ban permanent also began on April 16.

Under Section 7 of the NVRA, states are required to provide public \nassistance agency clients with an opportunity to register to vote every time they apply for or renew benefits \nor submit a change of address, whether done in person, by telephone, by mail or through the internet.  \nAccording to the lawsuit brought by a coalition of voting rights groups, Georgia had virtually ignored this \nmandate for years.  The settlement agreement includes steps the state must take, including methods for \ndistributing voter registration forms to public agency clients and voter registration training for public \nassistance employees.  [See http://www.lawyerscommittee.org/newsroom/clips?id=0495 for background on this \ncase and link to the settlement agreement.]   \n \nFEDERAL AGENCIES   \nU.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)  \nDOJ Uses Section 5 of the VRA to Block South Carolina’s and Texas’ Photo ID Laws.   \nSouth Carolina and Texas, as jurisdictions covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, had to \nsubmit their proposed voter photo identification laws to DOJ or the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia for approval before they can be implemented.  Under Section 5, the states have the burden of \nshowing that their proposed voter ID laws had neither the purpose nor the effect of denying or abridging \nthe right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.   \n \nSouth Carolina.  DOJ blocked implementation of South Carolina’s law requiring voters to present \nspecific state photo identification (ID), a military ID or a passport, finding that it would disproportionately \ndisenfranchise minority voters.   [See http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/ltr/l_122311.php to read DOJ’s \nDecember 23, 2011 letter to South Carolina blocking the photo ID law.]   \n \nTexas.  In March, DOJ also stopped implementation of the Texas photo ID law, requiring a driver’s \nlicense or photo identification from the state’s Department of Public Safety (DPS), a military photo ID, a \nUS citizenship certificate that contains a photograph, a U.S. passport or a license to carry a concealed \nhandgun.  DOJ found that 10.8 percent of Hispanics (or about 604,000 to 796,000 Hispanics) versus 4.9 \npercent of non-Hispanics do not have such IDs.  Texas told DOJ that those without these documents could \nobtain a free election ID certificate from DPS. DOJ found two problems with that proposal:  first, \nindividuals need underlying documents (e.g. birth certificates) to obtain the free certificate and also, in 81 \nof the state’s 254 counties there are no DPS offices and many of the offices that do exist are open for \nlimited hours, even assuming a person had a car to reach one of those offices.  [See \nhttp://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/ltr/l_031212.php for DOJ’s letter to Texas.]   \n \nSTATE AND LOCAL NEWS \n \nFlorida.  The League of Women Voters, Rock the Vote and the Florida Public Interest Research Group \n(PIRG) Educational Fund filed a lawsuit in federal court in Tallahassee challenging the state’s restrictions \non community-based voter registration drives. The provisions in the state’s 2011 adopted voting law (H.B. \n1355) include burdensome administrative requirements, unreasonably tight deadlines for submission of \ncompleted forms and heavy penalties for even slight delays or mistakes.  As a result of these restrictive  \n 6 \nrequirements, the League of Women Voters and Rock the Vote, among other groups, closed their Florida \nvoter registration programs. [Background about the state’s law and link to court documents are at \nhttp://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/league_of_women_voters_of_florida_v._browning/.]    \n \nMinnesota.  The state legislature passed a proposed constitutional amendment (Chapter 167, HF2738) to \nchange the state’s voting system that will be on the ballot in the November election.  The changes, among \nother things, would require all voters to show a government-issued photo ID in order to vote on Election \nDay and may call into question same day registration because such individuals would have to have their \neligibility verified before they vote; currently, such identity is verified after an election and if someone who \nis not eligible to vote does vote, she/he can be prosecuted for doing so.  The Republican led legislature put \nthe issue on the ballot because Governor Mark Dayton (D) vetoed similar legislation sent to him last year.  \nEven though the Governor could not veto and stop the proposed amendment from being on the ballot in \nNovember, he symbolically vetoed it, as he announced his opposition to it.  The summary written for the \nconstitutional amendment only addresses the voter photo ID requirement and not the other provisions so \nquestions have been raised about its adequacy in notifying voters of the full content of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment.  The same issue arose in Missouri, where a local court sent the issue back to the \nlegislature for a more accurate summary of their proposed constitutional amendment (see below).  [See \nhttps://www.revisor.mn.gov/laws/?id=167&year=2012&type=0 to read the proposed constitutional amendment; for \nthe Governor’s veto message, see http://mn.gov/governor/images/ch_167_hf_2738_veto_letter.pdfl.]   \n \nMissouri.  In 2011, the state legislature passed both a proposed constitutional amendment and separate \nlegislation to enact voter ID requirements.  The legislation was vetoed by Democratic Governor Jay Nixon \nbut he could not veto the proposed constitutional amendment (SJR 2) that will be on the ballot in \nNovember.  When passing the proposed constitutional amendment, legislators included a ballot summary \ndescribing its content.  On March 27, a Missouri Circuit Court judge struck down the wording of the \nsummary as “unfair and confusing” for voters, leaving voters with insufficient information about its subject \nmatter, which also, among other things, limits the days available for advance (or early) voting.  The Court \nsent the measure back to the legislature, allowing them to clarify the summary language before the election. \n [To read the Court’s decision in Emmanuell Aziz, et al. vs. Robert Mayer, et al., go to \nhttp://www.colecountycourts.org/Rel%20119%20Docs/Voter%20Ballot.pdf.]  \n \nPennsylvania.  On March 14, the legislature passed, and Governor Tom Corbett signed into law, \nlegislation (HB 934) requiring a photo ID to vote.  Voters will need to show a Pennsylvania driver’s \nlicense or other government-issued photo ID (e.g., U.S. passport, military ID, county/municipal or federal \nemployee ID).  A current photo ID from a state accredited public or private institution of higher learning or \na photo ID issued by state nursing home, assisted living home or health care facility will also be accepted if \nit includes an expiration date.  More recently, the state’s Secretary of the Commonwealth announced that \nanyone with a Pennsylvania driver’s license or ID that expired since 1990 may request a new photo ID \nusing only their name (and not the underlying documents otherwise required of new applicants) since their \ninformation will still be available in their computer database.  The new law is not effective until the \nNovember election, when the state’s 20 electoral votes are at stake but voters will be asked for a photo ID \nwhen they vote in April and if they don’t have a requisite ID, they will be allowed to vote but also given a \nflyer outlining what they need to get prior to the November election.

The legislature sent a voter ID bill (SB 1) to Governor Robert McDonnell on March 10 that \nwould require those who vote in person to show one of a list of IDs, including a voter registration card, \nsocial security card, valid Virginia driver's license, or any other identification card issued by a government \nagency of the Commonwealth, one of its political subdivisions, or the United States, as well as a valid \nstudent ID card issued by a four year institution of higher education located in the state. If a person does \nnot have the requisite ID, s/he would be allowed to vote with a provisional ballot and provide the requisite \nID to election officials the following day in order for their ballot to count; under current law, if the voter \ndoes not have an ID, s/he may sign a sworn statement attesting to their being the registered voter.  The \nGovernor did not veto the bill but sent the legislation back to the Senate, with proposals to give voters two \nadditional days to provide the requisite ID, to allow state election officials to validate these provisional \nballots by comparing a voter’s signature on the ballot with those on file with the state election board and to \nallow the use of community college ID cards for voting purposes. He also recommended deleting a \nprovision in the bill that would have allowed a voter without the requisite voter ID to vote if s/he was \nrecognized and acknowledged by an election officer.  The state legislature accepted only the latter \nrecommendation.

It also criminalizes everyday interactions with undocumented immigrants, such \nas providing car rides or renting living space, and criminalizes under state law the failure to carry federal \nregistration cards, a requirement for immigrants under federal immigration law. The U.S. District Court for \nthe District of South Carolina, Charleston Division, issued an order temporarily blocking the major parts of \nthis anti-immigrant law because they are likely to be found unconstitutional.

[See http://arc.org/shatteredfamilies to \nread the report.] \n \n The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) released three new reports in April, looking at the immigration flow of \nBlack Immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean, their Demographics and Well-Being, based on a number of \nindicators.  The reports show the diversity of these immigrants and find that 813,000 children under the age of \n10 have parents who are Black immigrants from the Caribbean or Africa, accounting for nearly 12 percent of all \nyoung Black children in the United States.  [All three reports can be found at http://www.migrationpolicy.org/.]  \n \n Another report by the Migration Policy Institute, “Up for Grabs:  The Gains and Prospects of First-and Second-\nGeneration Young Adults,” finds that youth and young adults from immigrant families represent one in four \npeople in the U.S. between the ages of 16 and 26.  This report profiles first-and second-generation young adults \nin this age group finding that “they differ widely in their language, age of arrival, citizenship status, gender, and \nrace and ethnicity – all factors that have a profound effect on their educational and workforce outcomes.”  [This \nNovember 2011 report is at http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/youngadults-upforgrabs.pdf.]  \n \n “Gaming the System 2012:  Guest Worker Visa Programs and Professional and Technical Workers in the U.S.,” \nlooks at the array of skilled worker visas available to employers, which are ripe for abuse by unscrupulous \nemployers.  The report by the Department for Professional Employees (DPE), AFL-CIO, notes that guest \nworkers can find themselves in working conditions akin to indentured servitude, bound to one employer for the \nduration of the visa, which can be up to six years.  They also find that U.S. citizens and permanent residents \nhave few protections against employers who game the system.  DPE concludes that comprehensive reform, and \nnot piecemeal changes, is imperative to protect workers and rein in employers.  [DPE’s report is available at \nhttp://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/.]  \n \nLGBT  \n In a new policy brief, the Center for American Progress (CAP) reminds us that communities of color throughout \nthe U.S. still face economic challenges and fewer opportunities than their white counterparts.  These issues, they \nfound, are exacerbated for gay and transgender people of color, who bear the brunt of the disparities faced by \nboth the gay community and communities of color.   They previously reported that the combined exposure to \nantigay and/or antitransgender policies, along with institutionalized racial discrimination, derails black gay and \ntransgender Americans’ financial stability, creates barriers to accessing quality health care, and erodes \nsafeguards for gay and transgender families.  The same is true for other gay and transgender communities of \ncolor.  As a result, gay and transgender people of color face high rates of unemployment or underemployment, \noverall lower rates of pay, higher rates of poverty and a greater likelihood of being uninsured.  [To read the \nApril 13 brief, go to http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2012/04/lgbt_comm_of_color.html.]  \n \n On March 26, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) obtained copies of the anti-gay marriage organization, \nNational Organization for Marriage’s (NOM), confidential strategy documents outlining their goal to divide \nAfrican Americans and Latinos from LGBT Americans.  Among the key findings that emerge from the court-\nordered disclosure are that NOM’s goal is to “drive a wedge between gays and blacks,” and “to make support \nfor marriage a key badge of Latino identity.”  [To read about the confidential strategy documents, see \nhttp://www.hrc.org/blog/c/nom-exposed/P10.]  \n \n In its most recent Corporate Equality Index (CEI), the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) rated 850 businesses, \nincluding the entire Fortune 500, on their LGBT workplace policies.  In this annual report HRC has chronicled \nthe changes that have taken place on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equality in the \nworkplace since its first report in 2002.  With no federal workplace protections for LGBT workers, only 13 \n 17 \nbusinesses received top scores in 2002, the first year the CEI was released.  This year, with more stringent \ncriteria in place – including equal health coverage for transgender individuals – 190 corporations received a 100 \npercent score.  [See “Corporate Equality Index 2012,” at http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/corporate-equality-\nindex-2011.]  \n \n An April report found that strict voter ID laws may also disenfranchise up to 25,000 transgender voters.  The \nreport by the Williams Institute at UCLA School, “The Potential Impact of Voter Identification Laws on \nTransgender Voters,” explains that transgender people who have transitioned to live in a gender different from \nthat assigned to them at birth face unique obstacles to obtaining documents that correctly reflect their gender.  In \nNovember, 88,000 such transgender people will be eligible to vote in the nine states that have adopted photo ID \nlaws and the study found that at least 25,000 of them living in strict voter ID states do not have updated driver’s \nlicenses that reflect their gender.  In the U.S. as many as 40 percent of transgender people reported not having an \nupdated driver’s license and 74 percent reported not having an updated passport; many such individuals are low-\nincome, minority, youth, students and people with disabilities.  Requirements for updating state-issued IDs vary \nwidely by state and can be challenging and costly.  Federal requirements also vary by agency, according to the \nreport.  [See http://www.projectvote.org/blog/2012/04/strict-voter-id-laws-may-disenfranchise-25000-\ntransgender-voters-study-finds/#more-2405 for background and link to the April 2012 study.] \n \n In November 2011, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights submitted to the United Nations \nHuman Rights Council a report they had requested documenting laws and practices and acts of violence against \nindividuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.  The report also looked at how international \nhuman rights law could be used to end violence and related human rights violations based on sexual orientation \nand gender identity.  [The report, “Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals \nbased on their sexual orientation and gender identity,” can be found at  \nhttp://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/A-HRC-19-41_en.pdf.]   \n \n Data on electoral victories, collected independently by the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund and Keen News \nService, indicate that in November 201l, 47 of 63 openly LGBT candidates on the ballot won their elections, \nincluding eight of nine mayoral candidates.  Four of five openly gay candidates won in North Carolina; the first \nopenly LGBT city councilmember was elected in Missoula, Montana; and the Houston and Indianapolis City \nCouncils elected an openly LGBT member.  The country’s first openly gay African American Republican mayor \nwas also elected in Chatham, New Jersey.  More recently, the third openly gay or lesbian African American was \nelected to the Georgia House of Representatives in a special election (which also has a fourth LGBT member).  \n[For complete results, see http://www.victoryfund.org/home and November 9, 2011, “Winning day for openly \nLGBT candidates,” Keen News Service, at http://www.keennewsservice.com/2011/11/09/winning-day-for-\nopenly-lgbt-candidates/.]  \n \nWomen’s Rights    \n There have been a number of recent reports on gender pay differences, including: \n \no The White House released the “Equal Pay Task Force Accomplishments Report:  Fighting for Fair Pay in \nthe Workforce,” providing a detailed progress report on the work of the Task Force towards the goal of \nclosing the gender pay gap.  The report includes information from each of the agencies involved in the \ninteragency Task Force.  [The April report is at \nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/equal_pay_task_force.pdf.]  \n \no The American Association of University Women (AAUW) released a new study that includes state-by-state \nequal pay rankings.  “The Simple Truth about the Gender Pay Gap,” charts the wage gap in the 50 states \nand the District of Columbia.  AAUW found the wage gap is narrowest in Washington DC – where women \non average earn 91 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts – while the state with the worst \nearnings ratio is Wyoming – where women make 64 percent of men’s earnings.  The national average puts \nwomen at 77 percent of men’s earnings.  [The 2012 Edition of this report is at \nhttp://www.aauw.org/media/pressreleases/EqualPayRankings2012.cfm.]  \n \n 18 \no The Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) released a Fact Sheet on “The Gender Wage Gap by \nOccupation.”   Among the findings is that women’s median earnings are lower than men’s in nearly all \noccupations, whether  they are in occupations predominantly done by women or by men or those with a \nmore even mix of men and women.  [The Fact Sheet is at http://www.iwpr.org/.]  \n \no A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, “Gender Pay Differences:  Progress Made, but \nWomen Remain Overrepresented among Low-Wage Workers,”  found that women with a high school \ndegree or less tended to work in industries and occupations, such as health care and social assistance, that \nhad lower wages than those in which men worked.  But even when less-educated men and women worked in \nthe same broad industry or occupation category, these women’s average hourly wage was lower than men’s. \n [The October 2011 report (GAO-12-10) is at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d1210.pdf.]  \n \n At a White House Forum on Women and the Economy, the White House Council on Women and Girls released \na report detailing some of the policies and programs supporting women and girls.  The report, “Keeping \nAmerica’s Women Moving Forward,” acknowledges the continued pay gap and how a woman with a college \ndegree doing the same job as a man will earn hundreds of thousands of dollars less over the course of her career. \n [The April 6 report is at http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/email-\nfiles/womens_report_final_for_print.pdf.]  \n \n The US Department of Labor (DOL) released an on-line publication designed to help women find and keep \nhigher paying jobs in the clean energy arena. The resource guide provides information about a range of in-\ndemand and emerging jobs, as well as job training opportunities and career development tools in the clean \nenergy sector.  [“The February 6 Guide, “Why Green is Your Color:  A Woman’s Guide to a Sustainable \nCareer,” is available at http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/wb/WB20120201.htm.]  \n \n The National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) has released two Fact Sheets related to Title IX and Athletics.  In \n“Debunking the Myths About Title IX and Athletics,” it raises and responds to various questions about how \nTitle IX impacts school athletic programs and what is and is not required.  “The Battle for Gender Equity in \nAthletics in Elementary and Secondary Schools,” examines the importance of equal sports opportunity for girls \nin elementary and secondary school athletic programs and complaints of discrimination in opportunities for \ngirls’ athletic programs that have arisen in some states.  [The January 30 Fact Sheets are available at \nhttp://www.nwlc.org/our-issues/education-%2526-title-ix/athletics.] \n \n A January report done for the National Partnership for Women and Families found that providing paid family \nleave for workers leads to positive economic outcomes for families, businesses and the public.  Women who use \npaid leave are far more likely to be working nine to 12 months after a child’s birth and report increased wages \nfrom pre-to-post-birth.  The report, done by the Center for Women and Work at Rutgers, the State University of \nNew Jersey, also found that women who take paid leave are about 40 percent less likely to receive public \nassistance and to use food stamps in the year following the child’s birth, when compared to those who do not \ntake any leave.  The Center also looked at the experience in five states – California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New \nYork and Rhode Island – which have created disability programs that allow women to recover some lost wages \nduring and immediately after pregnancy.  [See “Pay Matters:  The Positive Economic Impacts of Paid Family \nLeave for Families, Business and the Public,” at \nhttp://www.nationalpartnership.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=29356&security=2141&news_iv_ctrl=1\n741.]  \n \n In a November 22 report on family economic security, Wider Opportunities for Women (WOW) found that 45 \npercent of Americans are unable to cover their basic expenses.  WOW’s report, “Living Below the Line:  \nEconomic Insecurity and America’s Families,” tells the story of the relationship between economic security and \ngender, race/ethnicity, family structure and education.”  [See http://www.wowonline.org/livingbelowtheline.asp \nto read the report.]  \n",
