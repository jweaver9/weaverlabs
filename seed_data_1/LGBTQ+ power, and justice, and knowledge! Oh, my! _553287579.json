OH, MY!-OR-LIBERAL AND PROGRESSIVE FACTIONS OF THE LGBTQ+ MOVEMENT: A STUDY OFPOWER, JUSTICE, AND KNOWLEDGESocial movements are important to understand when studying the reification ofdemocracy because they are a mode of political action that is frequently utilized for a widevariety of causes by diverse sets of people. This work explores the differences of power, justice,and knowledge in the progressive and liberal factions of the LGBTQ+ Movement and what thatmeans for both the LGBTQ+ community and society. Using a historical analysis of the strategiesand actions of the liberal and progressive factions of what has grown to be the LGBTQ+Movement an examination with a lens of power provided by Lukes (2021), justice as fairnessadvocated for by Rawls (1958; 1971;2001), justice as recognition and redistribution put forth byFraser (1997) and Honneth (2004), epistemic injustice theorized by Fricker (2007), and willfulhermeneutical ignorance formulated by Pohlhaus (2012) will be conducted to evaluate theeffectiveness of change the two factions are able to create.iiACKNOWLEDGMENTSFirst and foremost, I would like to thank Dr. Courtenay W.

Power’s main focus within pluralist systems is in theformal institution(s) that make up the government because they are the only institutions vestedwith executive, legislative, and judicial authority. Other foci of power in modern democracies areinformal institutions known as pressure groups (ibid). These groups include political actioncommittees, interest groups, lobbyists, and social movements because they all exert pressure ongovernment institutions to act in a certain way (Bealey 1999, 267). While pressure groups do nothave the ability to enact formal policy changes, they have the capability to influence those withthe power to do so. Understanding pressure groups is fundamental to comprehending howmodern democracies function because they hold a significant amount of influence in democraticStates. The pressure group in the current line of inquiry is social movements and the kind(s) ofpower they have the capacity for, the justice they have the ability to provide, and the capability toproliferate knowledge on behalf of the community or entity they are mobilizing for.Social MovementsSocial movements, and their factions, fall broadly into four different types of politicalattitudes: reactionary, conservative, liberal, and progressive (Simpson, Willer, and Feinberg2022).1 Using the traditional liberal notion of a left to right political continuum, reactionary andconservative attitudes are on the right whereas liberal and progressive attitudes are on the left.Reactionary movements and factions occupy the extreme right end of the continuum as theyattempt to take society back to a “better time” by re-establishing a previous regime (O'Neil 2020,77). Oftentimes movements with a reactionary attitude will try to undo any and all progress1 Not all social movements have factions that fit all four attitudes.1society has made since the “better time” they are trying to revert to (ibid). Conservatives arecenter right on the continuum and do what their name says: conserve (ibid). They want topreserve the status quo and keep policy and society the way that it currently is (ibid). Liberalsoccupy the center left spot on the continuum and support change to the status quo, but throughsmall incremental changes using the established social and political institutions and processes(ibid). Progressives occupy the far-left side of the continuum and want to change society and thesystems that are currently in place because there are little or no redeemable qualities to the statusquo (O'Neil 2020, 76). Movements and factions with a progressive attitude believe that there isnothing worth preserving in the status quo and everything from social to political institutionsneed to be reformed to accommodate the modern world (ibid). These attitudes help formdifferent social movements and the factions within them. Different factions have differentideologies, goals, and strategies, which change the factions’ capacities of power, for justice, andability to proliferate knowledge on behalf of the community they are mobilizing for.The LGBTQ+ MovementOne of the longest standing social movements in the United States is the LGBTQ+Movement that seeks to better the lives of members in the community. While there are differentfactions in the movement that fight with each other, they are still part of the same largermovement with roughly the same goal in mind. I split the LGBTQ+ Movement into four distincteras with each era changing due to a significant event for the movement. The first era of themovement, the Homophile Era, started in 1950 with the creation of the Mattachine Society,which was the first organization in the United States that mobilized around homosexual issues(D’Emilio 1983, 58). In the aftermath of the Stonewall riots in 1969, the Gay Liberation Era wasformed with more invigorated ideas and strategies for gay liberation than what had been seen in2the Homophile Era. The AIDS Era was formed in the early 1980s when the AIDS pandemicstarted and the movement focused much of its energy on AIDS advocacy, which eventuallybecame its own movement as more accessible and effective treatment started to become morereadily available in the early to mid-1990s. After AIDS advocacy began to wane in prominencedue to access to better, widespread treatments, the Contemporary Era was formed as focusshifted from AIDS to eliminating systemic barriers that affected the LGBTQ+ community, suchas Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, sodomy laws, and legalization of same-sex marriage. These four erascompose the history, successes, and failures of what has come to be known as the LGBTQ+Movement as well as point to what it has left to do.Similar to other social movements, the LGBTQ+ Movement has developed differentfactions, specifically, progressive, liberal, and conservative. While the conservative faction doesengage in the significant endeavors of educating the Republican Party and conservatives onLGBTQ+ issues, supporting conservative pro-LGBTQ+ politicians, and advocating for LGBTQ+inclusive policies, this inquiry will address only the liberal and progressive factions (“About Us”,n.d.). The conservative faction is being omitted from this evaluation because any new analysiswill only further the saturation already present in the literature. Since its creation in 1977, theconservative faction has effectively focused its activism in three areas: 1) organize to defeat theBriggs Initiative in California, 2) fight for same-sex marriage, and 3) sue over the perceivedunconstitutionality of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (ibid). Until the conservative faction finds a newbattleground, there is no new analysis to be conducted on it because, in my assessment, it wouldnot contribute anything of substance to the literature that is not already there.The liberal and progressive factions of the LGBTQ+ Movement will be examined tounderstand the power that these factions have, their ability to bring justice to the community, and3their capability to proliferate LGBTQ+ knowledge. Capacities of power will be analyzed throughthe three dimensions of power defined by Lukes (2021) and will answer the question of thecapacity of power that the liberal and progressive factions of the movement have. Justice asfairness, as advanced by Rawls (1958; 1971; 2001), and justice as redistribution and recognition,as advanced by Fraser (1997) and Honneth (2004), will be utilized to analyze capacities forjustice in the liberal and progressive factions of the LGBTQ+ Movement. The notion ofepistemic injustice developed by Fricker along with Pohlhaus’ theory of willful hermeneuticalignorance will be used to evaluate the progressive and liberal faction’s ability to proliferateLGBTQ+ knowledge.Power, Justice, and KnowledgeThe concepts of power, justice and knowledge were chosen because each plays animportant role in a social movement’s ability to make effective change in society. The power thatsocial movements have allows them to influence change for their communities; however, theircapacity for justice and their capability to proliferate knowledge can be used to evaluate themovement’s ability to influence change that positively affects its community’s needs. Thus, usingthe lens of power, justice, and knowledge allows for an analysis of effective change. A lens ofpower by itself would be an examination limited to change because power is a necessaryrequisite for change; a lens of justice by itself would be limited to analyzing only the “effective”aspect in “effective change” because in order for change to be effective, it needs to adequatelyaddress the problem it is trying to solve, which is done through just practices; including the lensof knowledge supports the lens of justice because of the existence of unjust effects on society’scurrent stage of epistemic development. Using power, justice, and knowledge together creates aholistic mechanism to analyze the liberal and progressive factions of the LGBTQ+ Movement.4OverviewThis thesis explores new ways of analyzing social movements through a lens of power,justice, and knowledge in an effort to elucidate a more nuanced understanding of socialmovements through critically examining the kind(s) of change they have the ability to create,how that change provides justice to their constituents, and what is left for them do. The conceptsof power, justice, and knowledge that create this novel framework are explored in chapter one.Chapters two and three provide a unique conceptualization and history of the liberal andprogressive factions of what has come to be known as LGBTQ+ Movement in the United Statessince the movement’s inception in 1950; combined, these chapters provide the historical contextfor the analysis of power, justice and knowledge. Chapters four, five, and six examine,respectively, power, justice, and knowledge in the liberal and progressive factions of what hascome to be known as the LGBTQ+ Movement to demonstrate the different capacities of power,for justice, and degree of knowledge production and dissemination that are present in the twofactions.5Chapter One- Power, Justice, and Knowledge: An OverviewCapacities of power will be analyzed through the three dimensions of power defined byLukes (2021); justice as fairness, as advanced by Rawls (1958; 1971; 2001), and justice asredistribution and recognition, as advanced by Fraser (1997) and Honneth (2004), will analyzethe factions’ capacities for justice; epistemic injustice characterized by Fricker (2007) and willfulhermeneutical ignorance described by Pohlhaus (2012) will be used to evaluate the liberal andprogressive faction’s ability to proliferate LGBTQ+ knowledge. These specific frameworks havebeen chosen because of the depth of analysis they are able to provide. Lukes’ (2021) frameworkof power allows for a deep analysis of power in social movements because of the work thatsocial movements take on. The conceptualizations of justice provided by Rawls (1958; 1971;2001), Fraser (1997), and Honneth (2004) are very well situated to analyze the change providedby social movements because of the strategies they utilize. The frame of knowledge was createdusing epistemic injustice (Fricker 2006; Fricker 2007) and willful hermeneutical ignorance(Polhaus 2012) because those concepts allow for the creation of a mechanism of self reflectionthat can evaluate the outcomes of activism taken on by social movements. Additionally,combined these frameworks create a lens that is able to evaluate the effectiveness of changeprovided and strategies used by social movements.PowerPower is a concept that people understand without fully knowing its definition. Thisphenomenon has led to scholars like Dahl (1958), Polsby (1963; 1968), Bachrach and Baratz(1970), Lukes (2005; 2021), etc. trying to explain what power is and how it is reified. Lukes’conception of power is comprehensive and critical of previous scholars’ work and creates a6schematic that allows power and its reification to be easily understood (Lukes 2021). Lukes’framework, created through a critique and expansion of previous scholarship, reveals differentdimensions of power to provide a holistic framework through which to view power (ibid).The first dimension of power in Lukes’ analysis comes from Dahl (1957) and is known asthe pluralist view of power with a focus on observable behavior, “A has power over B to theextent that he can get B to do something that B otherwise would not do” (Lukes 2021, 21). Notonly is the pluralist explanation of power straightforward, it shows two different parts to power:potential and actual. In the first dimension of power it is the success of power’s exercise thatleads one to have power in decision making contexts where there is conflict because everyonehas the potential to influence the action of others, but it is when that potential is realized thatpower is reified (Lukes 2021, 24). There is a built-in limitation to the first dimension of power,however, because it only analyzes the behavior of those in decision making positions when thereis conflict, i.e., the first dimension of power only studies people’s observable behavior in asetting with conflict (ibid).While the pluralist definition does describe what many think of when the word powercomes to mind, it is not without its critics. Bachrach and Baratz are prominent critics of thepluralist conception of power because it focuses on observable behavior at the expense of agendasetting and the power that comes from it, “to the extent that a person or group--consciously orunconsciously--creates or reinforces barriers to the public airing of policy conflicts, that personor group has power” (Bachrach and Baratz 1970, 7). This power is realized through the words ofE.E Schattschneider, “All forms of political organization have a bias in favour of the exploitationof some kinds of conflict and the suppression of others…Some issues are organized into politicswhile others are organized out”, i.e., power is not only one’s ability to affect the behavior of7another, it is also present in those who decide what is on the agenda (Schattschneider 1960, 71).The ability to affect another person’s actions and what makes it on (or what is purposefully leftoff of) agendas is the second dimension of power. An exploration of the second dimension ofpower is an examination of actions as well as what is allowed to be acted on. The augmentationof the definition of power provided by Bachrach and Baratz (1970) does provide a much-neededexpansion on how people think about power, but it is still missing something because it is stillfocused too much on observable conflict and behavior.Lukes (2021) provides the idea to fill the lacuna on the definition of power thattranscends observable behavior and conflict. He critiques both Dahl (1957) and Bachrach andBaratz (1970) because both the first and second dimensions are inadequate for the holistic studyfor the reification of power (Lukes 2021, 30). As such, Lukes provides three critiques to the firsttwo dimensions of power. The first critique is that the first and second dimensions are only, “thestudy of overt, ‘actual behaviour’” (ibid). This is insufficient for the study of power because itfocuses too much on the individual and too little on the, “circumstances directly encountered,given and transmitted from the past” (Lukes 2021, 31). Secondly, within the first and seconddimensions, power can only be exercised within a conflict. This means that power to makepeople think certain things that is seen through consuming media and being socialized is ignored(Lukes 2021, 32). Lastly, the second dimension of power assumes that when there is nogrievance to a proposal, there is consensus, which means it, “[rules] out the possibility of false ormanipulated consensus by definitional fiat”, i.e., the second dimension of power assumesinaction on certain policy areas happens because people do not want any changes, but it couldmean action in that policy area is prevented from being considered via manipulation of ideology(Lukes 2021, 33).8The third dimension of power provided by Lukes is not focused on examining howpeople act within conflict, rather, it examines how ideology is formed (Lukes 2021, 34). There ispower in the influence of people’s ideology because it affects the way people engage with policyalternatives and how they view the world (Hershey 2017, 126). The third dimension of powerexamines how ideology is externally influenced by other actors and how that influence isreinforced; there is a holistic understanding of sociological, political, and historical contextswithin the third dimension of power. The third dimension of power transcends influence overobservable behavior and potential behavior, as it influences ideological development. Thetranscendental characteristic of the third dimension of power comes from the influence it hasover how people perceive the world and how they act off of that perception.Additionally, there are two different reifications of third dimensional power when itcomes to social movements: positive and negative. A positive reification of third dimensionalpower occurs when ideology has been changed in a way that furthers the social movement’sgoals, e.g., changing society’s perception of homosexuality so it is seen as a valid expression ofsexuality and not a disease or a moral failing. A negative reification of third dimensional poweroccurs when ideology is changed, but it furthers oppression that is seen, e.g., creating anenvironment where homosexuality is okay, but it needs to be done in a hypermasculine way to beseen as valid. This is an addition to Lukes’ (2021) framework provided by me in order toaccurately analyze the power seen by social movements, but there will be more on thatdistinction later.The concept of power is understood via this framework as it covers power over action,power over potential action (agendas), and power over ideology. All aspects of this frameworkare important when studying any kind of pressure group within any modern democracy because9of the different foci of power that exist in the framework in which modern democracies reside.Analyzing pressure groups’ ability to work within the three dimensions of power allows for anexamination of the extent it is able to influence the modern framework of democracy. It isimportant to look at not only the power that pressure groups have, but the different factionswithin them because then a deeper understanding of the power that specific pressure groups holdcan be elucidated because very rarely do pressure groups have one track strategies.JusticeIn a similar vein, there are different ways of thinking about what justice is and what itmeans for it to be achieved or to be experienced. Theories of justice are normative in nature andseek to establish what just societies ought to look like. The two main definitions of justice withinpolitical science are known as justice as fairness and justice as recognition and redistribution.The former was developed by Rawls (1958; 1971; 2001) in the mid-20th century and the latterwas developed by Fraser (1997) in the late 1990s and further developed by Honneth (2004).Justice as FairnessRawls (1958; 1971; 2001) establishes justice as fairness through the idea that ademocratic society would be just if political and social institutions operated fairly under justpractices (Rawls 1958, 164-65). In order to create this fair schematic of institutional practicesand set ups, the original position and the veil of ignorance are created (Rawls 2001, 14-15). Theoriginal position is a hypothetical scenario where people gather to discuss what social rules andinstitutions should look like in order to have the fairest possible practices; in order to preventpeople from making a political and social system that advantages them and people like themwhile creating barriers for those who do not, the discussants are behind a veil of ignorance thatprevent them from knowing the identities they will hold once they leave the original position to10ensure that no one ends up on the “wrong” side of what is created in the original position (Rawls2001, 16). Rawls (1958; 1971; 2001) theorizes that in these conditions people would create a justsociety due to that society being fair because decisions were made by impartial, rational actors(Rawls 2001, 14-15). Furthermore, the original position and the veil of ignorance work intandem to create an objective set of criteria that can bring justice to everyone because it assumesthat there are universal criteria by which justice is understood that benefits everyone regardlessof identity.To further ensure that a just political and social system is created there are two principlesof justice that evaluate the proposals in the original position (Rawls 2001, 42-43). The FirstPrinciple states that everyone, “has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme ofequal basic liberties” (Rawls 2001, 42). This is an important evaluative mechanism because inorder for society to be fair, people need to have access to the same rights and liberties as others.The Second Principle of Justice comes in two parts: a) if social and economic inequalities existthey have to be “attached to offices and position open to all under conditions of fair equality ofopportunity” and b) social and economic inequalities need, “to be to the greatest benefit of theleast-advantaged members of society” (Rawls 2001, 42-43). The first part of the SecondPrinciple postulates that in order for a democracy to be just, there need to be as few restrictionsas possible on who can hold office and vote and the second part tries to form equity in thecreation of a just society.An important facet of justice as fairness is the idea that justice is systemic. Any localizedinstance of injustice is a direct result of unfair practices and set ups of political and socialinstitutions (Rawls 1958, 164-65). Because justice as fairness sees injustice as being the resultsof flawed institutional setups and practices, this is inherently a top-down approach to justice, i.e.,11justice comes from the apex of democratic institutions down to individuals: the only way justicecan be introduced is through changing the practices and set up of political and social institutions.Justice as Recognition and RedistributionFraser (1997) and Honneth’s (2004) conception of justice focuses less on the eliminationof symptoms of inequality and more on the avoidance of things like humiliation and disrespectthat are fundamental causes of inequality (Honneth 2004). For Fraser (1997), justice is not justabout equality, it is about recognition and redistribution to help get at the root of what formsinequality and unjust societies. In the modern era, “Cultural domination supplants exploitation asthe fundamental injustice” recognition of the domination as well as its consequences will helpallow justice to be achieved (Fraser 1997, 11). Justice as redistribution is also important becauseit rectifies and helps stop further exploitation, economic marginalization, and deprivation that arepresent in modern society (Fraser 1997, 13).Justice as recognition is important because, “nonrecognition or misrecognition… can be aform of oppression, imprisoning someone in a false, distorted, reduced mode of being… Duerecognition is not just a courtesy but a vital human need” (Fraser 1997, 14). Justice asrecognition and justice as redistribution are intimately connected because oftentimesredistribution is preceded by a recognition of societal, institutional, or cultural failing that needsto be rectified (Fraser 1997, 15). This is not to say that justice as recognition and redistributionare top-down approaches like justice as fairness (Rawls 1958; 1971; 2001). Local instances ofinjustice can happen because individuals can refuse to recognize how their actions affect othersor they can misrecognize another’s wants or needs (Fraser 1997, 14-15).Honneth elaborates on Fraser’s conception of justice because to him, something is notquite right. Honneth has strong reservations about separating redistribution and recognition like12Fraser advocates for. To Honneth, a just society is one where everyone is afforded the dignity ofbeing recognized as their own autonomous social agent because they are not on the receiving endof disrespect or humiliation (Honneth 2004, 352). The idea of recognition is central to Honneth’sexpansion of justice as recognition:The justice or wellbeing of a society is measured according to the degree of its ability tosecure conditions of mutual recognition in which personal identity formation, and henceindividual self-realization, can proceed sufficiently well. (Honneth 2004, 354)It is through this recognition that justice is created. Those who are recognized as autonomoussocial agents and all of the identities within them are no longer disrespected or humiliatedbecause they are seen as autonomous social agents that are worthy of everything else that isafforded to other autonomous social agents (Honneth 2004). In other words, adequate andaccurate recognition of a holistic person needs to be extended to everyone in order for any kindof redistribution of rights, benefits, and privileges to be just.Within the framework of justice as recognition and justice as redistribution it is importantto note that justice is not something that is “one and done,” it is a continuous process that needsto be constantly undertaken in order for justice to be achieved. While justice as recognition andjustice as redistribution seem to strive for equality and/or equity that is not necessarily the case.There is an equality aspect to this framework because one of the goals is for people to berecognized as people and not seen as lesser than anyone else because of their culture, race, sexualorientation, etc., which has an air of equality to it; however, there is less of a potential fordomination within this framework. Fraser and Honneth’s framework does not assume universalcriteria for justice, which de-centers existing power structures because it allows for people toexist in a world without domination and marginalization. Moreover, this framework does not13have a top-down approach. Justice as fairness posits that with institutions and institutionalizedpractices created behind a veil of ignorance justice will be achieved, which means it is atop-down approach to providing justice. Justice as recognition and justice as redistribution,however, are able to work on providing justice from the bottom up and from the top downbecause recognition that helps breed justice needs to come from both the individual andinstitutions (Fraser 1997).KnowledgeThrough the lens of knowledge two important concepts will be used to analyze theactions of the liberal and progressive factions of the LGBTQ+ Movement: epistemic injusticedeveloped by Fricker (2007) and willful hermeneutical ignorance posited by Pohlhaus (2012).Both concepts explore the epistemic environment the LGBTQ+ Movement has formed andgrown in.Epistemic InjusticeEpistemic injustice comprises two separate phenomena: testimonial injustice andhermeneutic injustice (Fricker 2007, 1). Epistemic injustice prevents knowledge from beingtransmitted to others via testimonial injustice; it also prevents knowledge from being formed viahermeneutic injustice. These phenomena are prevalent in the LGBTQ+ Movement; however,before these impacts on the movement can be discussed, testimonial injustice and hermeneuticinjustice need to be analyzed.Testimonial InjusticeTestimonial injustice is when, “prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level ofcredibility to a speaker’s word” (Fricker 2007, 1). Testimonial injustice relies on prejudice, eithergrounded in identity or actions of a specific social group or person, meaning it can be systemic or14localized. Systemic testimonial injustice is when people experience a deflated level of credibilitydue to systemic prejudices e.g., women’s ideas being ignored in the workplace; localizedtestimonial injustice is when people experience a deflated level of credibility in one offcircumstances e.g., a board of editors not giving credence to a paper because of the researchmethod used (Fricker 2007, 27). The former is based on social biases and follows people as theyinteract with different institutions while the latter is rooted in a bias that one person or group hasthat remains isolated to that incident (ibid).At the core of testimonial injustice, someone is, “wronged specifically in [their] power asa knower” because their testimony does not carry the weight that it should (Fricker 2007, 20). Amisattribution of testimonial credibility is the cause of this injustice; it is because society, agroup, or an individual see another person or group of people as less than they are that someone’stestimony is given less weight than it should be (Fricker 2007, 17-22). Testimonial injusticeprevents knowledge from being transmitted from one person to another because the hearer givesthe speaker a credibility deficit due to a bias the hearer has against the speaker. As a result oftestimonial injustice, the speaker is deemed unfit to know by the hearer and the former’s capacityas a source of knowledge is diminished.Hermeneutic InjusticeHermeneutic injustice is a, “gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone at anunfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of their social experiences” (Fricker 2007,1). When someone tries to share their social interactions, lived experiences, or make sense oftheir identity but do not have the words to do so because they do not exist, that personexperiences hermeneutic injustice. This is a type of injustice that only people with marginalizedidentities (women, people of color, people in the LGBTQ+ community, etc.) can experience,15“The powerless are more likely to find themselves having some kind of social experiencethrough a glass darkly, with at best ill-fitting meanings to draw on in the effort to render themintelligible” (Fricker, 2007, p. 148). While society at large is also implicated in hermeneuticinjustice, it is the marginalized that bear its brunt (ibid). Fricker uses the Women’s Movement asan example of hermeneutic injustice. These examples have two different purposes: 1) theexample of sexual harassment in the workplace details the harm created by hermeneutic injusticeand 2) the example of postpartum depression provides a way of combatting this injustice.Fricker uses the rampant sexual harassment seen in offices during the mid to late 20thcentury to reify hermeneutic injustice through the experience of Mrs. Carmita Wood. Mrs. Woodworked at a nuclear physics laboratory for eight years before quitting due to constant sexualharassment; when she applied for unemployment insurance Mrs. Wood was asked why she quither job and she could not answer (Fricker 2007, 149-51). While the phenomenon of sexualharassment existed, the words to describe it did not (Farley 1978, 12). That is the crux ofhermeneutic injustice: there is a gap in the collective system of knowledge that prevents peoplefrom giving proper descriptions of their social experiences and/or their identities. Not only doeshermeneutic injustice prevent some people’s experiences from being rendered intelligible, it alsoprevents them from being understood; the existence of hermeneutic injustice necessitates theexistence of an epistemic black hole because neither society nor people experiencinghermeneutic injustice can fully understand their experiences and/or their identities.Fricker’s use of postpartum depression describes how hermeneutic injustice can beovercome. In the mid-20th century women’s groups were being created and people in thosegroups talked about their experiences. Some of these groups focused on women sharing theirexperience with depression after pregnancy. These groups facilitated adversely affected16populations coming together and gave people a platform to share their experiences with others,which helped those with postpartum depression and society gain a better understanding of whatwas happening during pregnancy and after birth (Fricker 2007, 148-49). While the consequencesof hermeneutic injustice are serious as will be explained later, there is a way of disassembling theepistemic black hole that is formed as a result of hermeneutic injustice.The hermeneutic lacuna seen in people’s inability to put words to experiences andidentity is harmful. People cannot put words to some of their experiences or identities meaningthe knowledge created by those experiences and identities can neither be created nor dispersed.This means that both the person and society are harmed by the injustice because neither canunderstand the experiences or identities of the former; however, the “cognitive disadvantage” ismore often than not a significant disadvantage to society, in fact there may be an incentive tokeep the injustice in place so as not to upset the status quo (Fricker 2007, 151).The impact of this injustice is disadvantageous to those who experience it because theirability to understand themselves is limited:The cognitive disablement prevents [them] from understanding a significant patch of[their] own experience: that is, a patch of experience which is strongly in [their] intereststo understand, for without that understanding [they are] left deeply troubled, confused,and isolated, not to mention vulnerable to continued [mistreatment]. [Their]hermeneutical disadvantage renders her unable to make sense of her ongoingmistreatment, and this in turn prevents her from protesting it, let alone securing effectivemeasures to stop it. (Fricker 2007, 151)Hermeneutic injustice limits people’s ability to understand themselves, how they fit into society,and how to explain their social interactions; this means that people who experience this injustice17are less likely to protest it and its consequences, e.g., sexual harassment, or be able to stop theinjustice and its consequences: it creates an epistemic black hole. These consequences ofhermeneutic injustice are severe because it facilitates a limited understanding of individuals andthe effects of certain social phenomena, but as the postpartum depression example shows, thereis a way to escape the aforementioned epistemic black hole.Willful Hermeneutical IgnoranceWillful hermeneutical ignorance was developed by Pohlhaus (2013) to further developFricker’s (2007) conception of epistemic injustice. This occurs when people dominantly situatedin society cannot make sense of the lived experiences or social interactions of marginally situatedpeople because they are utilizing an improper framework when listening to marginally situatedpeople. Unlike testimonial injustice and hermeneutic injustice, willful hermeneutical ignorance isalways systemic, “dominantly situated knowers… misunderstand and misinterpret the world”(Pohlhaus 2012, 716). Willful hermeneutical ignorance is best exemplified through people’sdisbelief of social phenomena like cisgender-heterosexual normativity or white privilege. Thesephenomena exist, but people who see the benefits of them ignore their existence and are unableto understand the world it creates for those who are harmed by the social phenomena. Willfulhermeneutical ignorance is exercised mainly by dominantly situated individuals because peopledominantly situated in society cannot make sense of the world they have created formarginalized groups, nor do they have the incentive to make or maintain epistemic resources formarginally situated knowers because the dominantly situated knowers’ grasp on epistemic powerweakens (Pohlhaus 2012, 719). The crux of willful hermeneutical ignorance is dominantlysituated knowers using and maintaining a faulty hermeneutic and epistemic framework throughwhich they view the experiences of others.18The example that Pohlhaus discusses is that of Tom Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird.The all-white jury in To Kill a Mockingbird refused to believe the experiences of Tom Robinson,they could not understand why a Black man in the Deep South in 1934 would help a whitewoman because he pitied her and could not understand that Tom was, “being set up because awhite woman made a sexual advance toward him, and her white father witnessed it” (Pohlhaus2012, 725). The white jury lives in a world where they do not have to worry about the effects ofthe racial politics that were rampant in the Deep American South because no matter what, theyalways come out on top. People of color are not so lucky; they experience a vastly differentworld where they can be charged, convicted, and killed just because of the color of their skin,“running away, it seems, is something a black man in Maycomb County cannot do withoutincriminating himself” (Fricker 2007, 24). The jury’s use of an improper hermeneutic andepistemic framework leads them to ignore the effects of racism and prevent them from beingfully able to understand Mr. Robinson’s social experiences and his testimony because of hisstatus as a black man.ConclusionThese theories of power, justice, and knowledge create the lens through which theprogressive and liberal factions of the LGBTQ+ Movement will be analyzed. They provide thetheoretical framework to understand the role that the factions have played in society.Lukes’ conception of power and its three dimensions explores the different ways thatpower manifests itself in the world and allows for a critical analysis because power is dissectedinto a basic foundation of an otherwise complicated subject. Justice as fairness and justice asrecognition and redistribution creates different criteria on which to base whether or not justicehas been provided, which can help determine what needs to happen next to create effective19change for a specific community. Epistemic injustice and willful hermeneutical ignoranceexplore the importance of the proliferation of knowledge because a stagnation of knowledgepresents itself with unique consequences, such as limited ability to understand social experiencesand identity, for both marginalized populations and society at large. Again, each of theseconcepts are important for having a more nuanced understanding of social movements.Analyzing movements’ capacity for power provides a holistic understanding of their ability tomake change; utilizing justice to examine social movements provides a mechanism to evaluatethe effectiveness of the change social movements are able to provide; using the lens ofknowledge allows for an understanding of what movements have left to do because it provides atechnique of self reflection.20Chapter Two- The Liberal LGBTQ+ Faction: An OverviewThe classification of the LGBTQ+ Movement’s liberal faction as liberal is an aptdesignation. The liberal ideology envisioned by Locke, Voltaire, Rousseau, Jefferson, and otherswas once a revolutionary force in the realm of political theory and government formation thatwas founded on representative institutions with the promise of freedom, liberty, and citizenshipfor everyone (Bronner 1999, 26-37). This once revolutionary political ideology and theoryquickly turned less and less anti-status quo as it started to conform to the interests of thebourgeoisie instead of those who had been systematically denied a voice in government andsociety for centuries (ibid). The arc of liberalism in transforming from a political movement foreveryone to the privileged few can also be seen in the liberal faction of the LGBTQ+ Movementthrough retreats to respectability, a tie to liberal institutions, and exclusion. The liberal faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement and its ties to liberal democratic theory donot stop at its transformational arc built from supporting the masses to privileging the alreadyprivileged few. Much like liberalism, the liberal faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement isinextricably tied to both institutions (D’Emilio 1983; Vaid 1995). This tie to institutions shapesthe faction’s strategies to focus on change within political institutions, for example, the SupremeCourt, in an effort to grant the LGBTQ+ community access to social institutions like marriage(Daum 2020). Furthermore, the liberal faction of the LGBTQ+ will fight to keep the status quo inplace but fight for its most minute mutation in an effort to make life more tolerable for LGBTQ+individuals who are white, cisgender, and able bodied, which means they combat the symptomsof the system that gave rise to their oppression and its maintenance instead of fighting the systemitself. This fight for the maintenance of oppressive systems leads to the inevitable exclusion of21what Vaid calls, “Objectionable gay people” (Vaid 1995, 38). These objectionable individuals arepeople who further transgress social rules such as effeminate men, butch women, the transgendercommunity, queer trans people of color, and poor LGBTQ+ individuals (ibid). The liberalfaction’s reliance on political and social institutions, a willingness to exclude the mostdisadvantaged in favor of the most advantaged, and their arc from radical organizations to a,“retreat to respectability,” truly make them liberal organizations (Bronner 1999, 26-37; D’Emilio1983, 75). In order to better understand the focus and timeline of the LGBTQ+ Movement’s liberalfaction, I have broken the movement up into four different eras: Homophile (1950-1969), GayLiberation (1969-1981), AIDS (1981-1996), and the Contemporary (1996-present). The definingattributes of the liberal faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement will be examined through all four erasin order to get a comprehensive and chronological understanding of the liberal faction of theLGBTQ+ Movement and why it is classified as such.Homophile Era: 1950-1969The Homophile Era is marked by the emergence of the Mattachine Society and theDaughters of Bilitis (DOB) (Marotta, 1981; D’Emilio, 1983; Adam, 1995). These twoorganizations were the first long lasting gay organizations in the United States. They developed,formed, and worked in an era characterized by hostility toward gay people; an era in which beinggay was considered an indicator of mental illness, moral deficiency, and a just cause to faceexclusion from social, political, or governmental institutions; it was an era awash with statesanctioned violence and oppression, pervasive in the lives of gay people through such acts as barraids and crackdowns on cruising, resulting in extreme difficulty coming to terms with one’sidentity because of the stigmatization and ignorance of homosexuality (Marotta, 1981; D’Emilio221983; Adam 1995; Rubenstein 1995; Vaid 1995; Meeker 2001; Woods 2017). The social realitiesof the day informed the goals, strategies, and structure of the Mattachine Society and theDaughters of Bilitis. An Arc to Moderation: The Homophile MovementIn the United States, the homophile movement, which would eventually evolve tobecome the LGBTQ+ Movement, began in November of 1950 with Harry Hay’s determinationto get society and homosexuals to recognize the latter as an oppressed minority and his desire toobtain civil rights for that minority (D'Emilio 1983, 9; Meeker 2001, 79). What Hay started haspersisted for over 70 years since that fateful November day. While the organization he startedwas one rooted in the desire and capacity for radical change, exclusion was a fundamentalcomponent of the Mattachine Society, and its liberal tendencies propagated by 1953 (D’Emilio1983, 57-91). Mattachine’s sister organization, the Daughters of Bilitis, were arguably neverradical, but there will be more on that later.The Mattachine Society and the Daughters of BilitisThe radical beginnings of the liberal faction of the Gay Movement can be seen within thevery formation of the Mattachine Society, the founders’ first goal, and the direction theorganization took after its May 1953 convention (D’Emilio 1983, 57-107). The founders of theMattachine Society wanted to see the status of homosexuals as social, legal, and moral outcastschanged. They wanted society to view homosexuals as an oppressed minority, “[The founders’]analysis that gradually emerged of homosexuals as an oppressed cultural minority” (D'Emilio1983, 65). The position and end goal of the founders was in diametric opposition to theprevailing beliefs of homosexuality that were held by the vast majority of Americans when theSociety was founded in 1950. Up until the latter part of the 20th Century, homosexuality was23seen as a mental disorder or a psychopathy that could be “cured” (Rubenstein 1995, Abstract).Because of the conventional “wisdom” of the mid-20th century, states passed sexual psychopathlaws that were aimed at targeting homosexual activity because they were seen as deviants whowere unwilling to get the help that society thought they needed (Woods 2017, 146). Mattachinesought to radically revise the way that society viewed gay people as well as expand gay people’sability to participate in society as openly gay individuals through an expansion of civil rights tothe homosexual minority (D’Emilio 1983, 60; Meeker 2001, 79). In the 1950s, homosexuals and lesbians were not seen as a minority that neededprotection, they were seen as diseased, immoral, and unnatural beings that society needed to beprotected from, not the other way around (D’Emilio 1983, 9). This is why the very formation ofthe Mattachine Society was radical. The founders of Mattachine sought to establish homosexualsand lesbians as a social group unto themselves and wanted to switch society’s perception ofhomosexuality and lesbianism from something that was morally bankrupt and diseased tosomething that was natural whose members were unjustly discriminated against (ibid). Thisambition of the Mattachine Society, changing society’s perception of a group of people, can onlybe seen as radical.The liberalness of the Mattachine Society can be elucidated through the transformationalarc its main founder had envisioned; Hay wanted Mattachine to transform into a homosexualrights organization after they had achieved the primary goal of getting homosexuals recognizedas a social group (Marotta 1981, 9; Meeker 2000, 79). The initial goals of the Society includedgetting homosexuals to realize that they were a class in themselves and for themselves; meaningthat homosexuals and lesbians were a class of people and more importantly a class of people whohad common interests (D'Emilio 1983, 67). The most common of these interests was24emancipation from the oppression seen in police raids, the fear of “meeting-up” with otherhomosexuals, and witch hunts that had the purpose of purging the homosexual from public life(D'Emilio 1983, 40-53). That is where the second goal of the Society came in. For Hay, it wasnot enough for homosexual people and society at large to realize that homosexuals are part of asubjugated group that had common interests, but homosexuals also needed protection against thediscrimination that was ubiquitous and wont to take the form of barriers to employment,entrapment, raids, and service refusal in places of public accommodation (ibid). The Mattachine Society was able to achieve these two goals to some degree. Throughreading groups and creating the infrastructure to help homosexuals meet privately, Mattachinewas able to help gays see themselves as part of a larger community that spans across SanFrancisco, the United States, and the world. Mattachine was also able to help combat some of thediscrimination seen by gay men at the hands of law enforcement specifically through the trial ofDale Jennings (D’Emilio 1983, 67 and 70-71). After Jennings was the victim of entrapment, asmany gay men were at the time, the Mattachine Society created the Citizens Committee toOutlaw Entrapment (D'Emilio 1983, 70-71). The committee distributed leaflets and pamphletsand secured donations to cover the trial's cost. Arguably, the activities of the Society and theCommittee led to the charges against Jennings being dropped (ibid). Though the MattachineSociety was founded on promising goals of radical change for the entirety of the homosexualcommunity, it had a built-in liberalizing arc and was dominated by gay men (D’Emilio 1983, 92).The work of Mattachine also became less radical after May of 1953 when the organization wastempered at its first annual conference (D’Emilio 1983, 75-91). In May of 1953, the Mattachine Society held a convention to draft a constitution andby-laws; after the restructuring of the Mattachine, the founders no longer held leadership25positions, and some did not continue their affiliation with the organization (D’Emilio 1983,86-87). In an attempt to distance itself from communism (which was a contentious issue as thefounders were communists and the society was formed during the McCarthy Era), Mattachine’snew leaders issued a statement that read, “Homosexuals… are not seeking to overthrow ordestroy any of society’s existing institutions, laws, or mores, but to be assimilated asconstructive, valuable, and responsible citizens” (D'Emilio 1983, 84). The new leadership alsodistanced itself from direct action; instead of grassroots organizing and campaigning on behalf ofthose who had been victims of oppression, Mattachine started to work more with socialinstitutions and professionals like lawyers and professors in an attempt for homosexuals to beseen as a less disruptive group mainly focused on finding ways to contribute to society despitesome “deficiencies” in their character (D'Emilio 1983, 85; Adam 1995, 69; Meeker 2001,79). The end goal for the homophile movement post-1953 was to assimilate into a homophobicand heterosexual centered society instead of making room for the homosexual in a moretolerating society (Meeker 2001, 79). These changes embody the transition from a progressivefaction to a liberal one (Bronner 1999, 26-37). They also helped inform the strategies and actionsof the liberal faction well into the Contemporary Era (Bernstein 1997; Seidman 1993).It could be, and should be, argued that the restructuring of Mattachine after 1953 helpedentrench and institutionalize the liberalism that was already in the organization via the seeminglysingular focus on the plight of the most privileged of the homosexual community: those whowere cisgender and male. The members of the Mattachine Society were mostly gay men; therewere a few token lesbians in the Society, but not many (D'Emilio 1983, 92). The Dale Jenningstrial, which put Mattachine on the proverbial map, held “Little immediate relevance forlesbians,” (D'Emilio 1983, 92) because they did not participate in cruising like their male26counterparts. Lesbians also had little disposable income during the era of Mattachine because thework they were able to find did not pay enough to guarantee financial freedom or security,meaning that few lesbians could actually live as a lesbian due to the heavy financial reliance thatwomen had on men in the mid-20th century, which was a major issue facing a substantial portionof the homosexual group that Mattachine ignored (Marotta 1981, 230; D’Emilio 1983, 93). Mattachine was not interested in the plight of the female homosexual; in fact, theyquestioned the need for an organization for their female counterparts. One of the founders of theDaughters of Bilitis testified to this disconnect at an annual convention held by the MattachineSociety, “At every one of these conventions I attend… I find I must defend the [DOB] as aseparate and distinct women’s organization… [Mattachine has not] recognized the fact thatLesbians are women and that this 20th century is the era of emancipation of woman [sic]”(D'Emilio 1983, 105). The Mattachine Society was more focused on making sure that gay menwould not be penalized for having sex, or going to gay bars, or cruising, but they also wanted tocreate a version of homonormativity that centered being gay around the experience of middle toupper class, cisgender, white men; the Mattachine Society fought for the most privileged amongthe oppressed and questioned the need to include others on the quest for being able to live as anout homosexual in society. The Mattachine Society already focused on the needs of white, gay,men when it was founded and that focus did not change after the overhaul in 1953, which led toan increase in the liberalism seen in the organization because of its reliance on existinginstitutions, embracing assimilation, as well as a scaling back on direct action like what was seenin response to the charges against Dale Jennings. This is not to say that the Daughters of Bilitis were better or more inclusive thanMattachine; they too fought for the most privileged among the lesbians. The organization was27founded by a pair of lesbians who had disdain for the bar scene which mainly attracted bluecollar lesbians (D'Emilio 1983, 106). Along with the class prejudice that came with theorganization, there was also a prejudice against the butch lesbian. The Daughters of Bilitis werevery outspoken about the need for gay women to present stereotypically feminine; many eventsheld by the DOB required participants to dress in what would be considered socially acceptableand they would rejoice when a butch lesbian was “feminized” (D'Emilio 1983, 103). TheDaughters of Bilitis was an organization that existed to serve the needs of the middle to upperclass lesbians, educate them on what lesbianism was, and how to raise kids as a lesbian (ibid).While they focused on issues that pertained to a more subjugated portion of the homosexualminority, they still primarily served the most privileged of that subgroup of the minority andcreated their own version of homonormativity centered around stereotypically femininehousewives with children (D’Emilio 1983, 92-107).The publications of the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis also show thetemperance of these organizations as they moved into the mid-1950s. Both Mattachine and theDOB published periodicals for their respective audiences and heterosexual society (D’Emilio1983, 103). Mattachine’s Mattachine Review and the DOB’s Ladder, “Spoke in neutral tonesrather than assuming the stance of impassioned partisans” (D'Emilio 1983, 109). Instead oftaking stances on issues, both publications tried to temper the flamboyance of their readers andwhat the leaders of Mattachine and DOB thought were homosexual behaviors that heterosexualswould find unacceptable. This fulfilled two different ends: 1) they helped create a type ofhomonormativity that encouraged assimilation and 2) they imparted to the psychologist, thelawyer, and the policy maker that homosexuals were a respectable people who were no differentthan the heterosexual. Both of these ends are assimilationist in nature. The former created a28homonormativity that mimicked heterosexuality and the latter projected the idea to a widersociety that the “good homosexual” did not stray from social expectations in any other way thantheir sexual proclivities.The creation of homonormativity can be seen in a frequent theme that permeated many ofLadder’s editorials. Lesbians who wore shorts, or had short hair, or presented in other masculineways were admonished by the DOB, who thought it was time to, “Do ‘a little ‘policing’,” of theirown (D'Emilio 1983, 113). This sense of normativity created by the DOB and perpetuatedthrough Ladder did not stop at presentation, it extended to the activities that were becoming ofacceptable lesbians. Officers of the Daughters of Bilitis and writers of editorials shared the beliefthat, “Gay women ‘aren’t bar hoppers,’..., ‘but people with steady jobs, most of them goodpositions” (D'Emilio 1983, 113). This belief from DOB suggests that the only acceptable lesbiansare the ones that act in accordance with how the dominant culture believes a woman should actwith the exception of being attracted to and/or having sex with other women.These standards of what it means to be a homosexual were not only pushed on thehomosexual community, but they were also accepted by people outside of the community(D’Emilio 1983, 114). The attempt at creating a homonormativity did not stop at presentationand admonishment of bar hopping, the latter being a classist gatekeeping mechanism (D'Emilio1983, 106). The creation of homonormativity by the DOB was also seen by the target audienceof the Ladder, which was lesbians who had children; the one organization that had a vestedinterest in making sure lesbians had a voice in the homophile movement eventually started toonly recognize lesbians as lesbians if they conformed to the singular image of the femalehomosexual that was a housewife, a mother, and presented stereotypically feminine (D’Emilio1983, 110). 29The origin of the LGBTQ+ Movement was radical but became dramatically less so in avery short period of time. The very idea that started the homophile movement, recognizinghomosexuals as an oppressed social group, was radical as its aim was to drastically changesociety’s perception of homosexuals and their rights; however, the movement became less andless anti-status quo. The seminal organization of the movement, the Mattachine Society, stoppedoffering help to gay men like they did to Dale Jennings in its nascent stages, After 1953 theleaders argued that the homosexual minority needed to make friends with people likepsychologists, lawyers, and professors, the leadership of the organizations issued a statement thatsaid the goals of Mattachine and DOB were no longer to pursue social change for thehomosexual minority while concomitantly excluding communists from the movement.Additionally, the leaders strove to create a homonormativity in an effort to proliferate the numberof acceptable homosexuals in an effort to make the homosexual community more palatable toheterosexual society (Marotta 1981, 12: D’Emilio 1983, 81; Kissack 1995, 107). The Daughtersof Bilitis were not expressly disinterested in helping working class lesbians, but DOB despisedthe aesthetics and practices of blue-collar lesbians who were less likely to have kids, which wasthe main audience DOB focused on (D’Emilio 1983, 93). Instead, DOB was more interested inhelping middle to upper class femme lesbians come to terms with being lesbian and help themraise their child(ren). The Homophile Movement was advertised for everyone, but in less thanthree years, the scope shrunk to only encapsulate those who aligned with gender norms.In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Mattachine Society suffered a major schism. Theaffiliates of Mattachine on the East Coast saw a return to radical strategies, which createdinsurmountable tensions between those who had been ushered into power after the 1953conference and the gays who had come of age when society’s perception of homosexuality took30on a “don’t ask, don’t tell” relaxed approach as opposed to active attempts to expose thehomosexual (Marotta 1981, 22-47; D’Emilio 1983, 165). Because forced outings had decreasedin the 1960s, a new generation of homosexuals who started to get involved with Mattachinewanted to pursue active efforts in grassroots organizing (Marotta 1981, 22-48; D'Emilio 1983,150). The east coast affiliates of Mattachine were organizing and engaging in direct action,namely by finding an ally in the American Civil Liberties Union in the pursuit to get the U.SArmed Forces to lift the ban on employing homosexuals (D'Emilio 1983, 154). The activities ofthe east coast Mattachine affiliates differed greatly from the activities of the Society post-1953.After the founders had been forced out of Mattachine, the organization mainly printed articlesarguing that the homosexual is no different than anyone else and balked at the idea of grassrootsorganizing or even taking a firm stance on any issue even if it was trivial (ibid). As the 1960scontinued, the differences became too much for Mattachine to bear and the national structure ofthe organization, which was already nearly non-existent, dissolved as the East Coast affiliatesdropped their Mattachine affiliation. Institutional Reliance in the Homophile EraThe arc of the Mattachine Society from radical to less anti-status quo is not the onlyreason the Society belongs to the liberal faction of the movement. There is an inherentliberalness that can be seen in the Mattachine Society through Hay’s second goal for theorganization: obtaining civil rights for the newly realized homosexual minority (D’Emilio 1983,9; Meeker 2001, 79). The objectives of this goal were to have employment security, stop thepractice of police entrapment, and even enlarge the scope of the family to include homosexualidentities (D’Emilio 1983, 40-53). The way to go about achieving these goals was through stateaction. By getting society to recognize the homosexual as a persecuted minority, Mattachine31hoped to work on an expansion of civil rights benefiting homosexuals (D'Emilio 1983, 9; Meeker2001, 79). This is a liberal strategy because, as Bronner (1999) wrote, liberalism is heavilydependent on the use of institutions to make change (Bronner 1999, 26); Vaid expands on thisbeing uniquely liberal because Mattachine’s successes are inextricably linked to politicalinstitutions as those are the method of redress for stopping entrapment, unequal access to work,and expanding the institution of the family to include homosexuals (Vaid 1995, 106). The secondmain goal of Mattachine, obtaining civil rights for the newly realized homosexual minority, wasliberal in nature because of the mechanisms that would be used to bring about its realization.After the 1953 Mattachine convention, the new leaders of Mattachine relied heavily onsocial institutions changing their perceptions of the homosexual community. Mattachinepost-1953 employed three different strategies: host talking groups as the organization had donesince 1950, publish a periodical, and lobby professional organizations like the AmericanPsychological Association, State Bar Associations, and Universities in an effort to get thoseinstitutions to change the way they viewed homosexuality with the end goal of those socialinstitutions being able to change society’s perception of homosexuality on behalf of thehomosexual community so they could assimilate into a heterosexual world (D'Emilio 1983,81-84; Adam 1995, 69). While the second goal envisioned by Hay in 1950 would most likelyhave relied on state institutions to grant homosexuals access to society, Mattachine post-1953increased the reliance on institutions to achieve their goals through the desire for socialinstitutions to work and eliminate bias and prejudice on behalf of the homosexual (D’Emilio1983, 81-84). Through shifting focus away from direct action to working with the AmericanPsychological Association, Bar Associations, and Universities as well as political institutions,Mattachine’s status in the liberal faction was solidified. As Mattachine became more liberal, so32did the Daughters of Bilitis. Due to the nature of the statuses of homosexuals, women, and ofhomosexual women in the mid-20th century, DOB and Mattachine worked closely together andused similar strategies to help advance the rights and social standing of their respective groups(D’Emilio 1983, 101).In 1961 Franklin Kameny joined the Mattachine Society in Washington D.C and helpedfacilitate a return to political action Mattachine was known for pre-1953 (D’Emilio 1983, 149).Because of Kameny, Mattachine started protesting and lobbying politicians again instead oftrying to get professors, lawyers, and doctors to represent homosexuals to politicians. He wasalso convinced that Mattachine should focus more on civil rights and started Mattachine’srelationship with the American Civil Liberties Union (D’Emilio 1983, 153-155). In 1965 afterfour years of protests at key government buildings, testifying before congress and the CivilService Commission, and meeting with Members of Congress, Kameny’s faction in Mattachinewon leadership positions and took Mattachine to a time of reliance on political institutions toobtain civil rights for the homosexual in America.A reliance on social institutions also comes with making minute changes to the status quoto make life livable and ending there. Social and political institutions can rarely change the socialrealities that create oppressive structures because they benefit from that structure. Unfortunately,making minute changes via institutions was prevalent in the New York Chapter of Mattachine(MSNY). As the 1960s came to a close New York’s Mayor John Lindsay, came out in support ofthe Black community after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.; when MSNY requestedLindsay support gay rights legislation, he refused to respond (Faderman 2015, 217-18). Thepresident of Mattachine Dick Leitsch continued to defend Lindsay after he refused to respond bysaying, “It was Lindsay who had made the city ‘livable’ for gay people by ending police33entrapment” (ibid). This statement shows MSNY, or at the very least its leader, supportingsystems of oppression, but making the most minute changes to the status quo so that New Yorkwas “livable” for the most privileged homosexuals as Lindsay’s refusal meant an almost surecontinuance of discrimination in employment, housing, and places of public accommodation.Dick Leitsch was also an avid opponent of protests and marches and an avid proponent ofusing political institutions to make change (Faderman 2015, 193-94). He did not want tojeopardize the liberal alliances he had made at City Hall obsolete (ibid). To be fair with Leitschat the proverbial helm, Mattachine was able to end police entrapment in the city, got gays theright to drink in bars legally, and was able to get the New York Civil Service Commission to endits policy on banning homosexuals from employment (Faderman 2015, 194). All of these wereimportant accomplishments; however, the reliance on these political institutions had, in a sense,tied Leitsch and Mattachine to those institutions, which made it unlikely Mattachine would doanything to put their ties to City Hall in danger. As long as New York City policy only hurt themost vulnerable in society like women, the poor, the homeless, people of color, trans people,those sitting at intersections of marginalized identities, etc. Mattachine would look the other way.Exclusion in the Homophile EraThe last hallmark of liberalism seen in Mattachine, and DOB is the exclusion of certainmembers of the homosexual community in order to advance the needs and wants of the mostprivileged. Mattachine arguably started off with a penchant for exclusion as they focusedexclusively on the needs of gay men and questioned the need for an organization that paidattention to the needs of lesbians (D’Emilio 1983, 92-93). The Daughters of Bilitis, while givinga voice to female homosexuals in the fledgling homophile movement, left a great many lesbiansout of their purview (D’Emilio 1983, 96-101). DOB did not want blue collar or butch lesbians to34be associated with the movement for fear that lesbians who further transgressed social normswould hurt the movement (ibid). The question of why is easily answered: respectability. The unfortunate reality was that attitudes towards homosexuality in the United Statesduring the 1950s made it difficult for homosexuals to do much of anything without being seen asillegal, immoral, and social outcasts (Marotta 1981; D’Emilio 1983; Adam 1995). Because thepeople who founded and led the homophile movement were people whose only subalternidentities were their sexuality and in some cases their gender, the willingness to excludeobjectionable gay people was high (D’Emilio 1983, 92-93 and 96-101; Vaid 1995, 38). Thiswillingness was justified by the potential of being able to bring some reprieve for thehomosexual community and arguably helped Mattachine and DOB push their versions ofhomonormativity because if the “respectable” homosexuals were the ones who were able to“transcend” oppression, then more homosexuals may have conformed to the homonormativitypushed by the two organizations. More importantly, however, is that this privileging of“respectable” homosexuals at the expense of the least privileged homosexuals and Mattachine’sand DOB’s push for homonormativity helped solidify Mattachine and DOB as liberal GayMovements by embodying a core part of liberal ideology, exclusion of the least privileged for thebenefit of the most advantaged, in the two most prominent homophile organizations of the 1950sand 1960s. The Gay Liberation Era: 1969-1981The Gay Liberation Era started after the New York Police Department’s raid of theStonewall Inn on June 29th, 1969 and lasted until the AIDS epidemic started circa 1981 (Adam,1995; Vaid, 1995). This era saw a new openness to homosexuality by gay individuals than whathad previously been seen. Almost 20 years after the founding of Mattachine and the start of the35homophile movement, members of the gay community actively and publicly labeled themselvesas gay and actively sought better ways of achieving the goals of the previous era (Marotta, 1981;Adam, 1995). The Gay Liberation Era of the movement arguably is the truest embodiment of theliberal arc the Gay Movement has yet to see because of its radical beginnings, the exclusion of“objectionable” homosexuals, and the high reliance on both political and social institutions that anew generation of gay organizations exhibited in the 1970s (Marotta 1981; Adams 1995).An Arc of Moderation: Gay Liberation, Gay Activists, and RadicalesbiansThroughout the late 1950s and 1960s, police forces all over the United States would raidgay bars; the raids were such a common occurrence they have been described as, “An Americaninstitution- a police rite to ‘manage’ the powerless and disrespectable” (Adam 1995, 81). It was acommon occurrence that many people in the early Gay Movement were fearful of and wantedstopped, especially as city wide raids would proliferate around election seasons; however, oneraid stands out amongst them all: Stonewall. On June 27th, 1969, officers from the First Divisionof the Public Morals section of the New York City Police Department raided the Stonewall Innand changed the face of the Gay Movement as society knew it (Marotta 1981, 71; D’Emilio1983, 206-7). As the police rounded up patrons of Stonewall, the crowd got restless and foughtback against police and state sanctioned oppression (Samar 2001, 147).As the East Coast homophile organizations saw a return to grassroots strategies and directaction in the early to mid-1960s, the events at Stonewall helped bring about a new era in the GayMovement by igniting a new passion for gay liberation, the Gay Movement saw a return to thefounding of organizations rooted in radical ideas that relied on radical strategies to achieveradical goals like gender equality, a proliferation of anti-racist ideology, and much more (Marotta1981, 24-25; D’Emilio 1983, 149-175). This new era of the movement started out with an36ambivalent outlook on civil rights that bordered on the pessimistic because, “Why petition to belet into a social system so deeply rooted by racism, sexism, militarism, and heterosexism?”(Adams 1995, 82). This passé outlook on civil rights also saw a rebuke of institutions, bothsocial and political, as a mechanism for change. It appeared as though the Gay Movement hadseen an advance to the avant-garde. Unfortunately, much as the homophile movement had donenearly twenty years prior, the radical origin would soon be tempered and see an introduction toexclusion as well as a reliance on political and social institutions to achieve the goals of theorganizations that propagated during this time.The Gay Liberation FrontOne of the first organizations that was created in light of the Stonewall riots was the GayLiberation Front (GLF), which was created on June 29th, 1969, just two days after the Stonewallriots and was the first organization to have the word “gay” in its name (Adam 1995, 82). Thename “Gay Liberation Front” helps show the radical origins of this organization: gay was amoniker used within the community to identify themselves, liberation had the rhetorical impactof being free from the Rousseauian chains placed on the gay community by a homophobicsociety, and front was used as a way to show both the gay community and society at large thatthe movement was going to see a return to militaristic (what I call radical) strategies (Marotta1981, 91; Kissack 1995, 113). The revolutionary foundation of the GLF is not only seen in itsname, but also in the structure, or lack thereof, of the organization. GLF had no officers, thechair of meetings would be rotated, ad hoc project groups took the place of committees,decisions were made via consensus instead of majority rule, and everyone who wanted toparticipate could (Marotta 1981, 92). Third, GLF participated in other liberation movements likethe Anti-War Movement, the Women’s Movement, and supported the Black Panthers (Kissack371995, 108). Lastly, the Gay Liberation front described itself as part of a larger counterculturemovement against a system that, “denies [gay people] our basic humanity in much the same wayas it is denied to blacks, women, and other oppressed minorities; the grounds are just asirrational. Therefore, our liberation is tied to the liberation of all people” (Kissack 1995, 108).The GLF was, inarguably, an organization that was founded on radical ideas with a structure thatmade it an organization for everyone, and the organization acted on one of the most importantfactors of radical movements: creating alternative queer institutions (ibid). The Gay LiberationFront was founded as an organization for everyone; however, that soon changed.Rhetoric used by members of the Gay Liberation Front near the beginning of organizationwas very masculine in nature that alienated and “doubly marginalized” women (Kissack 1995,110-12). This alienation helps show, just as Mattachine had done nineteen years prior, the GLF’sformative exclusion of women and the organization benefiting the already privileged members ofthe gay community (ibid). While the GLF was open to everyone who wanted to come, less than ayear after the formation of the Gay Liberation Front there was an exodus of women who had feltthe organization was focusing too much on the needs and wants of gay men (Kissack 1995, 119).This focus came in the form of task groups aimed at countering police entrapment, sodomy lawreform, or organizing dances that turned out to be heavily catered to men (D’Emilio 1983, 92;Adams 1995, 99; Kissack 195, 119). There was also a dress code that the Gay Liberation Frontenforced at weekly meetings, which created a different kind of homonormativism than the onecreated by the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis and, “GLF had a stern sense ofwho belonged and who did not” (Faderman 2015, 199).The Gay Liberation Front, much like the Gay Activist Alliance, which will be discussedlater, excluded people based on gender, race, and socioeconomic status (Gan 2013, 296;38Duberman 1994, 233-34). People like Sylvia Rivera who was a Cuban American transgenderactivist, found that she, and others like her, were not welcome members of the Gay LiberationFront based on their gender identity, racial and ethnic identity, and status as a “street person”(Gan 2013, 296). Despite wanting liberation for all gay people and its close connection withracial liberation groups like the Black Panther Party, the Gay Liberation Front was not exactlywelcoming people on society’s margins with the proverbial open arms its founders had wanted to(Kissack 1995, 116; Gan 2013, 296). The failure to accept women, people of color, transgenderindividuals, and “street people” paint a picture of exclusivity in the Gay Liberation Front (Gan2013, 296). Unfortunately, the GLF took exclusion one step further when it came to trans womenof color. Sylvia Rivera help found the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance but,“dropped out of these organizations after members worked to ‘really silence us’” (Daum 2020,5).Along with the exclusion of “objectionable” gay people, the men of the Gay LiberationFront helped keep their Rousseauian chains intact. One of various feminist critiques of malehomosexuality is the focus on hypermasculinity in the gay community (Kissack 1995, 120).Unfortunately, hypermasculinity dominated the GLF through foundational rhetoric and the waythat gay men defended themselves in society. Jim Fouratt, a founding member of the GLF said ata formation meeting, “Sweet? Bullshit! There’s the stereotype homo again, man! . . . Bullshit!That’s the role society has been forcing these queens to play, and they just sit and accept it” (Teal1971, 28). He, and many other gay men in GLF were not going to sit and accept the conceptionof gayness being equated to being feminine that was pushed on them by society (Kissack 1995,111). While it is good that men had fought back on the idea of gayness being equated withfemininity and emasculation, they compensated through hypermasculinity which only served to39morph male homosexuality into a place of simultaneous liberation and oppression (Kissack1995, 120-21). Due to the focus on hypermasculinity among gay men, the GLF created a spacewhere men showing their gayness was okay and acceptable but having other “feminine”attributes was not.2 The gay men in the GLF fought for a minute mutation to society, but helpedmaintain their system of oppression through creating, “a catch-22 situation in which gay malesexuality became a site of liberation and oppression” (Kissack 1995, 121).Through a transformational arc from the Gay Liberation Front being an organization forrespectable and “objectionable” gay people alike to an organization that focused almostexclusively on the needs of the most privileged members of the community, rejecting theparticipation of “objectionable” gay people, and creating an environment that wassimultaneously a place of liberation and oppression, the Gay Liberation Front showed itself to bea part of the liberal faction. The only move GLF did not make that is a hallmark of a liberalorganization was to get involved in political and professional institutions. Though there was aneffort within the first six months of the GLF to get chapters of the to become a political force inlocal politics across the country, this ultimately failed (Kissack 1995, 116). Even without thereliance on political and professional institutions to make change, the Gay Liberation Frontstarted to resemble its predecessors more than it did any radical or progressive organization.The Gay Activists AllianceThe Gay Liberation Front was not the only gay organization that’s nascency occurredafter the Stonewall riots. The Gay Activists Alliance was formed in December of 1969 whendisaffected members left the GLF after they had approved donations to the Black Panther legaldefense fund (Kissack 1995, 117; Bronski 2011, 212). The Gay Activists Alliance had a shorttime where they were a radical movement. Even though the organization split from the GLF2 Here, the first “feminine” attribute is being attracted to and having sex with men.40because of the former’s support of those fighting racial injustice and focused solely on gayissues, they were welcoming of most people including transgender activists. In fact, SylviaRivera and Marsha P. Johnson, two trans women of color, helped form the organization (Bronski2011, 212). However, the acceptance of others quickly faded.The Gay Activists Alliance adopted a constitution that codified contempt for political andsocial ideologies while also prohibiting the alliance of the GAA with any other organization(Carter 2004, 235; Bronski 2011, 211). However, the GAA was radical through theirconfrontations with anti-gay individuals and institutions in what have come to be known as\"zaps\" (Bronski 2011, 211). These zaps took the form of sit-ins, disruptive actions, and streetconfrontations; they have been described as guerilla tactics used by activists (Campbell 2007). In1970, New York’s Mayor, John Lindsay, was forced to address gay issues in the media as a resultof these guerillaesque zaps (Adam 1995, 88). Arguably, the most effective and successful zapswere a series of them aimed at medical and psychiatric associations due to the classification ofhomosexuality as a mental illness. These zaps resulted in the removal of homosexuality from theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1971 when the annualconference hosted by the American Psychological Association was the target of a zap that wasyears in the making (Faderman 2015, 282-83).The GAA was also concerned about the status of lesbians in society and why they werenot being given the consideration they deserve by the public, the media, and politicians (Marotta1983, 286). In 1972, the GAA organized a zap in a bar. The members who attended danced withmembers of the same sex; men and women came and participated in the zap, but only the malecouples were asked to leave by the manager, which gave the impression that the manager did notsee lesbian activism as anything of substance (ibid). Furthermore, when Jack Paar invited41members of the Gay Activists Alliance on to his show to discuss the usage of slurs in the media,he objected to the inclusion of a lesbian in the “delegation,” but the GAA did not back down(ibid). The Gay Activists Alliance cared about the issues that lesbians faced and wanted theirvoices to be heard just like gay men’s voices were.But eventually, the most radical thing about the Gay Activists Alliance were the identitiesof the women who helped form it: Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, both transwomen ofcolor. Throughout the 11 years the GAA was active, these two founders were around for lessthan four before being forced out because of their trans and non-white identities, “If someonewas not shunning her darker skin or sniggering at [Sylvia’s] passionate, fractured English theywere… denouncing her sashaying ways as offensive to womanhood” (Gan 2013, 269). As theGAA was forming, they gladly welcomed all types of gay people as exemplified by theorganization pushing stories about gays who defied stereotypes to the press, but when theorganization became established, the objectionable gays were dropped (Eisenbach 2006, 107).On the institutional front, some members of the Gay Activists Alliance wanted to seek politicaloffice and the organization's ties to political institutions were formed in an effort to provide gayalternatives at the ballot box (Bronski 2011, 211). In the end, the Gay Activists Alliance sufferedfrom the same liberalization that weakened the effectiveness of the Mattachine Society.The RadicalesbiansWhen it became clear that the Gay Liberation Front was only going to focus on men inthe movement, women left the GLF to form their own organization that, just like the Daughtersof Bilitis, focused on women because gay men, which were a majority of the GLF, “don’t give adamn about the needs of women” (Faderman 2015, 232). Rita Mae Brown was the catalyst forthe creation of Radicalesbians. She knew that gay men did not care about the issues effecting42lesbians and her time in the National Organization for Women (NOW) showed her that theWomen's Movement had the same outlook on lesbians as the GLF (Faderman 2015, 233; Marotta1981, 130-31). Brown had wanted to change the Women's Movement’s outlook on lesbians, soshe recruited the few lesbians left in the Gay Liberation Front to do so (ibid).Before the Radicalesbians took on that name, they identified themselves as the LavenderMenace (LM) because the leader of NOW, Betty Friedan, had referred to the inclusion oflesbians in the Women's Movement as the Lavender Menace (Marotta 1981, 244; Faderman2015, 233). The Lavender Menace had two goals: 1) get the Women's Movement to acceptlesbians and not see them as a threat to the movement and 2) get the Women's Movement tofocus on issues affecting lesbians (Faderman 2015, 235). They were successful on both fronts.The National Organization for Women was the mainstream organization in the Women'sMovement that was against the inclusion of lesbians, so Lavender Menace organized a zap tooccur at the second congress to unite women (Marotta 1981, 244; Faderman 2015, 236).Lavender Menace hijacked the conference, distributed their manifesto detailing what theywanted, and shared stories about what it was like to be a lesbian in liberation movements thathelped keep power structures in place that oppressed the most vulnerable members of thepopulation they were fighting for (Faderman 2015, 236).After the zap at the second congress to unite women, the Radicalesbians formed as agroup to help advocate for lesbians and women within social and liberation movements.However, their definition of “woman” was limited to those who were born women.Radicalesbians had so much disdain for Sylvia Rivera, Marsha P. Johnson, and their organizationStreet Transvestite Action Revolutionaries because they believed that transgender women were,“mocking women by mimicking what demeaned them” (Faderman 2015, 231). The43Radicalesbians opposition to including transgender women as well as the articles and books theywrote on the matter helped create a group of feminists who balked at the idea of trans women;this group would eventually grow into what are known today as trans-exclusive radical feminists(TERFS) (Nownes 2019, 26). While Radicalesbians was born from a need to fill a gap in theissues taken on by the movement and the Women’s Movement, they refused to fill that gap fortransgender women or even acknowledge them as women. Just as NOW believed that lesbianinclusion posed a threat to the Women's Movement, the Radicalesbians believed that theinclusion of trans women posed a similar threat.Institutional Reliance in the Gay Liberation EraThe political and institutional relationships that were cultivated during the Gay LiberationEra by the two most prominent organizations in the Gay Movement are mainly reflected in theactivities of the Gay Activists Alliance as the Gay Liberation Front was more anarchistic thananything else and did not seek to participate in the institution based political action that the GAAwas eager to start. The institutional involvement of the Gay Activists Alliance can be seen in twodifferent ways: 1) a focus on civil rights and 2) the political aspirations seen in some members ofthe GAA.As mentioned previously, zaps were a guerillaesque tactic that organizations in the GayMovement utilized in the 1970s. The most impactful one during this era of the Gay Movementwas, arguably, the series of zaps that lead to the American Psychological Association removinghomosexuality as a mental disorder from the DSM in 1974 (Adam 1995, 88). Bronski writes,“[The GAA] focus only on achieving civil rights for gay people” (Bronski 2011, 211). Adams(1995) succinctly sums up how the zaps concerning the American Psychological Associationhelped achieve this goal of civil rights, “A century of psychiatric talk in the United States had44provided the underpinnings for a range of anti-homosexual practices. After all, what rights coulda psychopathology have?” (Adams 1995, 87). Removing homosexuality as a mental disorderfrom the DSM, while good for the progressive faction of the movement as the “experts” were nolonger considering gayness as a mental deficiency, it also helped gain “underpinnings” in supportof gay civil rights because of homosexuality’s newfound status. This new designation ofhomosexuality helped destigmatize it and gave legislators cover to decriminalize sodomy in theUnited States at a faster rate than had happened before the APA removed homosexuality from theDSM (Woods 2017, 696). While it is unclear why the Gay Activists Alliance made the AmericanPsychological Association a prime zapping target, it did not hurt the GAA as its leaders dabbledin lobbying later on.The Gay Activists Alliance was focused on statutory change and working within existingsocial institutions and wanted to establish gayness as an identity that needed to be legallyprotected from discrimination (Engel 2019, 131). It was mildly successful in this effort. In NewYork the GAA was able to convince Representatives Bella Abzug and Ed Koch to introduce theEmployment Non-Discrimination Act to protect gay identities in employment and denouncepolice practices of raids and entrapment, it was also successful in getting a ban on employmentdiscrimination within NYC’s cities agencies; they were also able to secure employmentprotections in Ann Arbor, East Lansing, San Francisco, Washington D.C, Pennsylvania, andCalifornia (ibid). However, the GAA was not able to universally find success. Outside of NewYork and California, defeats were more common to come across than successes (ibid). The GAAwas not only focused on state and local statutes it also had a concerted effort on lobbying theMcGovern Presidential Campaign in 1972, and pressuring politicians, mainly RepresentativesAbzug and Koch from New York, into supporting gay rights legislation (Faderman 2015, 250).45Bruce Voeller, the chair of the GAA’s State and Federal Government Committee wanted to getthe message out to politicians that there is a gay vote, and they could benefit from endorsementsof organizations in the Gay Movement; Voeller also used his position to organize a meeting ofGay Movement leaders to create a non-discrimination plank for the official Democratic Party’splatform, which was not adopted at the Convention in 1972 (Faderman 2105, 253).The second connection to institutions comes in the political arena. Members of the GAAhad political aspirations and used the organization as a launch pad for their ambitions (Eisenbach2006, 267). After the members of the GAA lost their elections, they were still involved inelectoral politics and political institutions through lobbying on behalf of gay rights legislation(ibid). The lobbying helped increase the political legitimacy of the GAA and helped it become alegitimized part of the political process. Some members of the Gay Activists Alliance split fromthe organization to form the Gay Political Union as a lobbying group (ibid). The Gay ActivistsAlliance, while it did serve as a way for a few to launch political campaigns, was at first more ofa steppingstone for the type of political involvement that is a hallmark of liberal organizations.Just two years after its formation, the GAA got acutely involved in political practices andinstitutions at almost all levels of government. This involvement came in the form of helpingsome GAA members launch election campaigns; it also manifested through petitions to supportcivil rights for gay people and helping create a plank for gay civil rights for a national politicalparty. This involvement is liberal in nature because activists were primarily working within theconfines of the system that created and maintains their oppression.Exclusion in the Gay Liberation EraJust like the homophile movement before them, the Gay Liberation Front, the GayActivists Alliance, and Radicalesbians all excluded people in the community from their spaces.46The Gay Liberation Front’s formative rhetoric and actions were centered around the gay maleexperience that less than 18 months after the GLF formed, there was a mass exodus of womenbecause the issues facing lesbians were not being addressed by the organization and they nolonger felt like they belonged (Kissack 1995, 119). Furthermore, the environments created by theGay Liberation Front, the Gay Activists Alliance, and the Radicalesbians were ones that werehostile and unwelcoming to trans people, people of color, effeminate men, other “objectionable”gay people, and anyone sitting an intersection of two or more of those identities (Kissack 1995;Eisenbach 2006; Bronski 2011; Gan 2013). The Gay Liberation Front focused only on the needsof gay men; the Gay Activists Alliance was fundamentally exclusionary; GAA left the GLFbecause of its support for the Black Panthers and its push for legislation excluded protections fortransgender people; the Radicalesbians excluded trans women and created the theoreticalfoundations of Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism (Bronski 2011, 212; Faderman 2015, 231;Nownes 2019, 26).AIDS Era: 1981-1996The AIDS Era started with the AIDS crisis around the beginning of the 1980s and lasteduntil 1996 with the Supreme Court’s decision in Romer v. Evans (517 US 620 [1996]). TheSupreme Court declaring state sanctioned discrimination statutes, like Colorado’s Amendment 2,unconstitutional ushered in a sense of acceptance of same-sex couples to social, governmental,and political institutions that laid the foundation for the next era’s strategies for social change.The end of this era saw a decrease in AIDS activism in the Gay Movement as AIDS activismbecame a social movement unto itself and the liberal faction of the Gay Movement refocused itsattention to expanding civil rights. The arc towards moderation is missing during this era;however, that only means the organizations in this era did not shift from progressive to liberal.47AIDSUnbeknownst to anyone at the time, on June 5th, 1981, the Gay Movement would changeforever with Michael Gottlieb’s report to the Center for Disease Control of five men withpneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which served as the beginning of the realization of the AIDSpandemic (Faderman 2015, 415). Despite the “discovery” of AIDS in 1981, it was not until themid-80s that the disease started to be addressed in domestic policy after it had spread to peoplewith no history of homosexuality or intravenous drug use; AIDS being visible coupled with thoseit mainly infected led to an increase in anti-gay rhetoric (Adam 1995, 155-57). Most of theactivity surrounding AIDS belongs to the progressive faction as most of the organizing duringthis time went to grassroots campaigns or direct action (ibid). The lobbying that occurredsurrounding AIDS was almost all centered around making sure that government bodies like theFDA and legislatures were taking the epidemic seriously (Vaid 1995, 69-105; Bronski 2011,232).Institutional Reliance and AIDSThere was a lot of institutional reliance among national gay and lesbian organizationssurrounding AIDS. The Lambda Legal Education and Defense Fund grew stronger as a result ofAIDS litigation (Vaid 1995, 74). In 1983 Lambda won the first ever AIDS discrimination lawsuitthat stopped the eviction of a doctor because he was treating people with AIDS (“Lambda LegalHistory”, n.d.). Lambda continued to litigate AIDS issues throughout the course of the 1980s and‘90s that gave people access to treatment that was AIDS related (ibid). Other organizations likethe American Civil Liberties Union, the Human Rights Campaign, National OrganizationsResponding to AIDS, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and others also had a strongreliance on political institutions (Vaid 1995, 74). These organizations lobbied governments of all48jurisdictions to provide protections for people with AIDS, legislate away hateful and harmfulpolicies, and fund research into AIDS to figure out how to treat the virus (Vaid 1995, 69-106;“Stonewall at 50. ACLU at 100. A Legacy of Fighting for Justice and Equality.”, n.d.; “HowHIV Impacts LGBTQ People”, n.d.).Unlike organizations such as NGLTF, ACLU, HRC, and NORA, the Treatment ActionGroup (TAG) was formed as a direct response to the AIDS crisis by disaffected members of theAIDS Coalition to Unleash Power’s Treatment and Data Committee due to infighting making themission of research and patient advocacy nearly impossible (“History – Treatment ActionGroup”, n.d.). The Treatment Action Group focused on partnering with government agencies likethe Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes for Health as well as drugcompanies to research and develop new HIV therapies (ibid). TAG was only interested inworking with government agencies and their corporate partners to further the advancement ofAIDS research and treatment (ibid).Exclusion in AIDS ActivismThe rhetoric and framing of AIDS that came from the NGLTF and other organizationsactively focused on non-gay identities in the national conversation surrounding the disease andthe advocacy that those groups engaged in. Oddly enough, the National Gay and LesbianTaskforce along with others categorically excluded gays and lesbians from the mainstreamdiscussion and framing of the AIDS crisis (Vaid 1995, 75-76). National gay and lesbian groupslike the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce (NGLTF) de-gayed AIDS, as they, “[removed] thestigma of homosexuality from the stigma of AIDS” (Vaid 1995, 75). This was a strategic move towin access to institutions that otherwise would not have done anything about the epidemicbecause of the people the disease affected the most.49Furthermore, by de-gaying AIDS, organizations like the NGLTF centered the effects thatAIDS had on heterosexual individuals, which gave credibility to the idea that gay, lesbian, andtrans lives are less important than straight cisgender ones (Vaid 1995, 75). Instead of centeringthe struggles of gay, lesbian, and trans people with AIDS, framing and rhetoric provided by theNGLTF surrounded the impact that AIDS had on heterosexuals by putting the sadness and griefcaused by a loved one’s AIDS diagnosis or death above the discrimination and suffering of thequeer individual (Vaid 1995, 75; Trout 2020).The National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce’s campaign of, “AIDS is not a gay problem; it’sa human problem” implied that gayness and humanity are mutually exclusive and activelyremoved queerness from a queer issue (Vaid 1995, 75). The liberal faction’s framing, rhetoric,and strategy surrounding AIDS activism helped reinforce the status quo of exclusion, instead ofpushing for transformation because it lent credibility to the idea that, “AIDS would not be asimportant if only gay or bisexual people were susceptible” (ibid). The rhetoric and framing of theliberal faction prioritized heterosexual feelings and susceptibility over the humanity andsuffering of gay, lesbian, and trans people.The actions of organizations like the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce alsode-centered queerness in the AIDS crisis. National gay and lesbian organizations that fought toimprove the standing of homosexuality in society had heterosexual people speak on behalf ofgays and lesbians, which put them at the mercy of a homophobic and ignorant society (Vaid1995, 75). The liberalness seen in the response to AIDS from the NGLTF and others thataccepted their rhetoric and framing came in the form of self-exclusion from the national,mainstream conversation about AIDS and the effect that it was having in the population mostlikely to get the virus. Gay people were all but removed from the liberal faction’s response to50AIDS through rhetoric, framing, strategies, and actions that focused on AIDS’ effect onheterosexuals.Media made by AIDS activists also showed exclusion and the effect of excluding gayvoices from the mainstream AIDS discussion and advocacy. Playwright Larry Kramer wrote TheNormal Heart about the AIDS crisis (Campbell and Gindt 2018, 388). It, “was written in a timewhen gay, white men were dying in large numbers and were victimised and were excluded frompower and it tells that story and it tells it very accurately” (ibid). Mainstream media created byone of the most prominent AIDS activists four years into the epidemic, focused on the effectsthat the disease had only on white gay men (ibid). The experiences of lesbians and people ofcolor were all but absent from the work. Furthermore, Angels in America by Tony Kushner,created a false narrative that was influenced by the framing and rhetoric of organizationsde-gaying AIDS. Angels in America told a story of heterosexual people being the saviors of theAIDS crisis, which ignored the reality of what was happening (Campbell and Gindt 2018, 389).When the play was written, people with AIDS were being abandoned by straight society andcould only rely on each other for help (ibid). Media created during this era surrounding thebiggest call to action the movement had seen up until that point excluded the very realexperiences of people with AIDS as a whole as well the experiences of lesbians, people of color,etc. and those sitting any intersection of those identities.By design, The Treatment Action Group was not the most inclusive of organizations. Inthe aftermath of its formation it was invitation only (Schulman 2019, 45). As a result of thispolicy, there were no people of color in TAG for the first few months of its existence; when aperson of color was invited to join, the meeting took place in a 5th Avenue apartment and it was,“unfriendly. No one felt comfortable there” (ibid). The formation and recruiting policies of TAG51purposefully excluded people of color and when people of color did join the group, theyexperienced an unfriendly and uncomfortable environment.Institutional Reliance After AIDSAs the 1980s wound to a close, the emphasis on AIDS that had enthralled the movementfor years had started to wane. A renewed focus on civil rights for the gay community took theplace that the AIDS crisis once occupied. The liberal faction of the Gay Movement set its sightson removing hurdles for civil rights for gays in the United States, which helped create thestrategy of the movement for the next era.In 1992, Colorado decided to see how far states could go in allowing discriminationagainst gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. In November of 1992 Colorado voters approvedAmendment 2, which rescinded state and local laws that prohibited discrimination on sexualorientation and prevented any entity from enacting anti-discrimination laws based on sexualorientation (Zamansky 1993, 221). After Amendment 2 was passed, gay people and severalmunicipalities with the help of the American Civil Liberties union sued to stop the amendmentfrom taking effect and they were successful at the state level because it could not pass the strictscrutiny test (Law 2019). On the federal level, Amendment 2 was struck down in Romer v. Evans(517 US 620 [1996]) because it violated the equal protection clause due to the pro-discriminationpolicy not being rationally related to a legitimate state interest (Law 2019).The victory in Romer was extremely significant as it was the first pro-gay decision thatwas handed down by the Supreme Court since 1958 (Law 2019). Until the decision in 1996, themovement believed that fighting change through the courts was a lost cause as the Courtcontinually handed down homophobic opinions in cases that concerned something as simple ashaving sex with a member of the same sex (ibid). However, Romer changed that perception.52Members of the gay community mobilized around defeating Colorado’s Amendment 2 in thecourt system and with the help of the ACLU that is exactly what happened (Engel 2019, 200).Outside of AIDS, the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce, the Human Rights Campaign, theACLU, Lambda, and others were not having that much success (Vaid 1995, 159-174). Romerturned the proverbial tide and set up the strategy for political action in the liberal faction, butthere will be more on that later.Activism surrounding AIDS and Amendment 2 were not the only ties this era had toinstitutions. At the tail end of the Post-Gay Liberation Era, the LGBTQ+ Victory Fund wasfounded to support LGBTQ candidates for all levels of political office to advance equality for thecommunity (“Our History – LGBTQ Victory Fund”, n.d.). The Victory Fund was created byveterans in the liberal faction like David Mixner who had been active in the National Gay andLesbian Task Force and member of the Clinton transition team (ibid; Vaid 1995, 165-66). TheVictory Fund is inextricably tied to political institutions because the goal of the organization is tohelp as many LGBT people gain access to those institutions. It was successful. During the fiveyears of its existence in the Post-Gay Liberation Era it raised substantial amounts of money tosupport LGBT candidates with several winning their elections (“Our History – LGBTQ VictoryFund”, n.d.). The Victory Fund also pushed for Roberta Achtenberg to be nominated AssistantSecretary of Housing and Urban Development, who would be confirmed by the Senate as thefirst openly gay presidential appointee to a senate confirmed position (ibid).Contrary to other organizations that comprise the liberal faction, the LGBTQ VictoryFund was not exclusionary and did not focus exclusively on white cis gay men. The first personthe Victory Fund endorsed and helped fund was Black lesbian running for a seat on the SeattleCity Council, which is a demographic the Fund continues to support (“Our History – LGBTQ53Victory Fund”, n.d.). The Fund helped people, regardless of party, get elected at any level orbranch of government (ibid). Even though the LGBTQ Victory Fund did not have a liberalizingarc, they still sit firmly in the liberal faction because of their focus on making change throughpolitical institutions.With an increase of allyship and attempts to access political and government institutions,the Post-Gay Liberation Era saw a growth in dependency on institutions that would proliferatefurther in the coming decades. Organizations like the NGLTF, HRC, NORA, Lambda Legal, andTAG that mobilized around AIDS worked within political and government institutions to eitherend the formal discriminatory practices against those with AIDS or to research the disease withinthe homophobic paradigm that was ubiquitous in the government’s response to AIDS. Theexistence of the LGBTQ Victory Fund also tied the liberal faction more to political andgovernment institutions because it developed a strategy of advocacy that could only be realizedthrough working with and in institutions. The ACLU’s success in Romer also set the stage fororganizations in the liberal faction, like Lambda Legal and the GLBT Legal Advocates andDefenders (GLAD), to make more of a concerted effort to utilize the court system in theiractivism.Exclusion After AIDSThe exclusion that was seen after AIDS stems from Romer, which foreshadows exclusionin the Contemporary Era. Romer set the groundwork for creating dichotomies of sexual identity(Marcus 2020, 333). The language in the decision, which was actively celebrated by liberalorganizations like Lambda Legal, excluded bisexuality (Engel 2019, 200). Romer goes muchfurther than exclusion, it wades into the territory of invalidating identity via a sociolegalconstruction of sexuality with the only categories being heterosexual and homosexual.54Invalidating the existence of sexualities that are not heterosexual and homosexual creates a falsedichotomy of sexual orientation and excludes people who do not fit in the box of homosexualityfrom legal protections granted through the success of litigation strategies created and celebratedby liberal organizations like Lambda Legal, the ACLU, and GLAD (Engel 2019, 200-01; Marcus2020). The ramifications of the sociolegal framework created by Romer will be explored more inthe next section.The Contemporary Era: 1996-PresentThe Contemporary Era is marked with a notable proliferation of civil rights for gays,lesbians, and transgender individuals through instances like the Court finding anti-sodomy lawsunconstitutional in Lawrence v. Texas (539 US 558 [2003]), expanding the institution of marriageto same-sex couples in U.S. v. Windsor (570 US 744 [2013]) and Obergefell v. Hodges (576 US__ [2015]), and interpreting Title VII to protect sexual orientation and gender identity in theworkplace in Bostock v. Clayton County (590 US __ [2020]). This era of movement has also seensomewhat of a course correction through the mainstream incorporation of gender issues thatwere previously missing and actively excluded from the movement (Colbert 2014). This era alsosaw liberal organizations like the Human Rights Campaign lobbying states and the federalgovernment to legalize same-sex marriage and end employment discrimination for gays andlesbians. Freedom to Marry was also created during this era for the sole purpose of expandingthe institution of marriage to same-sex couples via state legislatures and referenda (Wolfsonn.d.a).Institutional Reliance in the Contemporary Era: Judicial ActivismLiberal gay rights organizations like the Human Rights Campaign, the National LGBTQ+Task Force, Freedom to Marry, Lambda Legal, and GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders55(GLAD) along with the American Civil Liberties Union have been extremely active in theContemporary Era of what has come to be known as the LGBTQ+ Movement. A substantialamount of the liberal faction’s activity since 1996 has utilized an institution that had beenpreviously avoided: the court system. Historically, the court system had been unfriendly towardthe LGBTQ+ community, but the decision in Romer v. Evans signaled to activists that the courtsystem could be an ally in the fight for gay rights with the first gay friendly decision since 1958(ONE, Inc. v. Olesen 355 US 371 [1958]; Engel 2019, 200; Law 2019). After 1996 in response tothe Romer decision, Lambda, GLAD, and the ACLU started to utilize the court system more intheir strategies, which has led to a long string of federal successes that have given same-sexcouples the right to have sex, diversified the institution of marriage to include same-sex couples,and has given employment protections to gays, lesbians, and transgender individuals (ibid).The Role of the Supreme CourtExcept for the demise of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, the court system was the main venue forfederal civil rights battles during this era (“LGBTQ Rights Timeline in American History »Teaching LGBTQ History”, n.d.). The inclusion of the Supreme Court in the movement startedin 1958 when the Court ruled that ONE did not violate obscenity laws (ONE, Inc. v. Olesen 355US 371 [1958]). With the 1958 decision being the first and last gay friendly opinion, during the1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and most of the 1990s, the movement did not view the court system asfriendly to the plight of gay people. However, 1996 saw a change in the relationship with theSupreme Court because Romer was a gay friendly opinion that had spurred the movement toincorporate the Court more heavily in its rights-based strategies (Romer v. Evans 517 US 620[1996]; Engel 2019, 200). Instead of organizations like the National LGBTQ Task Force(formerly the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force), the Human Rights Campaign, and the56ACLU focusing exclusively on the legislature and the executive, they expanded the venue toinclude the court room (Engel 2019, 200). This strategy has, for the most part, been successfulbecause it has expanded the civil rights available to the LGBTQ+ community.Romer v. Evans. As explained in the previous section, the 1996 Supreme Court case Romer v.Evans shifted the movement’s view of the Supreme Court because instead of handing down ahomophobic opinion that excluded homosexuals from the institution of marriage (291 Minn. 310,191 N.W.2d 185 [1971]) or said that same-sex sex could be made illegal by the states, the Courtissued a gay friendly opinion (Law 2019). This signaled to the movement that the Court waswilling prevent civil rights infringements on the sole basis of sexual orientation (Daum 2020,34). The decision in Romer also informed the litigation strategies used by Lambda, the ACLU,and GLAD, but there will be more on that later (Daum 2020, 34-36)Lawrence v. Texas. In the 2003 case Lawrence v. Texas that was brought to the Supreme Courtby the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Court struck down sodomy laws in theUnited States (539 US 558 [2003]). This decision was a reversal of the 1986 case Bowers v.Hardwick (478 US 186 [1986]) that upheld state laws banning sodomy between consentingadults (ibid). Lawrence v. Texas was in the same vein as Romer in the sense that it showed thecourts to be more favorable to both gay people and gay conduct. The ruling also went a stepfurther and showed a willingness to reverse homophobic precedent because, as Justice Kennedywrote in the Court’s opinion, “Bowers was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correcttoday. It ought not remain binding precedent” (Lawrence v. Texas 539 US 558 [2003], 578). Thereversal of Bowers allowed organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, LambdaLegal, and GLBT Legal Advocates and Defenders to seriously consider attempting to overturnBaker v. Nelson that had upheld bans on same-sex marriage because the court had signaled their57willingness to advance civil rights for gays and lesbians. Furthermore, the fact that the SupremeCourt had issued two gay friendly decisions within a decade convinced liberal organizations likethe Human Rights Campaign and the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce to ally themselveswith the aforementioned legal organizations.U.S v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges. Both Windsor and Obergefell deal with the sameissue: gay marriage. This had been a hotly contested topic since the 1996 passage of the Defenseof Marriage Act (DOMA) (Faderman 2015, 566). DOMA was the brainchild of conservativeRepublicans who wanted to make a preemptive strike against gay marriage by making it legal forstates to not recognize a marriage between same-sex couples that was performed in a differentstate, i.e., a marriage that was not between one man and one woman in Hawai’i did not have tobe recognized in Utah despite the Full Faith and Credit clause (Faderman 2015, 587). The pushfor DOMA happened because states like Hawai’i and Massachusetts legalized same-sexmarriage and the Republicans in Congress wanted to put President Clinton, who was supportedheavily by gay and lesbian voters, between the proverbial rock and a hard place heading into hisre-election bid (ibid). Much has changed since the Defense of Marriage Act was signed byPresident Clinton in 1996 namely Windsor and Obergefell, both of which helped secure gaypeople’s right to marriage in two drastically different ways.Windsor was one of the first steps to combating bans on same-sex marriage in the UnitedStates. With assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil LibertiesUnion, and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, Edie Windsor sued the FederalGovernment because she claimed she was unfairly taxed when her wife passed away and Edieinherited her late wife’s estate (“Windsor v. United States | American Civil Liberties Union”2014). In 2013, the Supreme Court found Section 3 of DOMA unconstitutional because it58violated the Due Process Clause of the 5th amendment (U.S v. Windsor 570 US 558 [2003], 578).While Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act only dealt with federal recognition and spousebenefits, not the exclusion of marriage from the Full Faith and Credit Clause, its dissolution bythe Court did mark a move toward recognizing that marriages between same-sex anddifferent-sex couples should be treated equally by federal agencies (Faderman 2015, 628).The decision that many people and organizations within the LGBTQ+ community werewaiting for happened exactly two years after the decision in Windsor. With the help of the ACLUand Gerhardstein & Branch, Jim Obergefell and David Michener sued the state of Ohio becausethey would not be listed as spouses on their late husbands’ death certificates (“Obergefell, et al.v. Hodges - Freedom to Marry in Ohio” 2015). On June 26th, 2015, the Supreme Court issuedtheir ruling on Obergefell v. Hodges and with the words, “same-sex couples may exercise thefundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them,” same-sex marriagebans were found unconstitutional and overturned (Obergefell v. Hodges 576 US __ [2015],22-23). This ruling combined with Windsor created state and federal recognition of same-sexmarriages and opened all the benefits of marriage to married same-sex couples because same-sexcouples had to be recognized by both the individual states and the federal government.Bostock v. Clayton County. The last Supreme Court win for the LGBTQ community came inJune of 2020 with Bostock v. Clayton County. This case was a consolidation of three petitionsaccepted by the Court and litigated by the ACLU (“LGBTQ Discrimination Cases at theSupreme Court | American Civil Liberties Union” 2020). The Court ruled that firing someonebased on sexual orientation or gender identity violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964(Bostock v. Clayton County 590 US __ [2020]). This was a fight that had started back inDecember of 1957 when Franklin Kameny, the man who brought the Mattachine Society back to59lobbying and protesting, was terminated from the U.S Army Map Service (D’Emilio 1983, 151).The problem became more pervasive in the 1970s because LGBTQ+ people were being firedfrom their jobs or being the victim of harassment or assault simply because they were notcisgender or heterosexual (Faderman 2015, 566). It was a cause taken up in 1974 byRepresentatives Bella Abzug and Ed Koch in the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA),but unfortunately there was no movement on the bill in the House of Representatives in the1970s and gender protections would not be added into ENDA drafts until 2007, but there will bemore on that later (Faderman 2015, 565).Even though nothing happened with ENDA in the 1970s and 1980s, the 1990s saw theunthinkable almost happen. After intense lobbying on the part of, what was then called, theNational Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC),Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy and Representative Gerry Studds had to, “do somethingfor gays and lesbians” (ibid). The two congressmen drafted a newer version of EmploymentNon-Discrimination Act that would protect gays and lesbians in the workplace and the hope wasthat it would be, “righting senseless wrongs” (Faderman 2015, 566). Unfortunately, ENDA diedboth in committee in 1994 and 1995 and in 1996 it failed on a deadlocked Senate floor with avote of 49-50.Activists and the Supreme CourtThe very institutional setup of the Supreme Court prevents it from acting proactively onany issue; questions have to be brought to the Court, it cannot go searching for them (Fisher andHarriger 2019, 140). Regarding the cases of Romer, Lawrence, Windsor, Obergefell, andBostock, gay rights organizations and activists played a huge role in getting the cases to the Courtand crafting litigation strategies. Organizations that have become a bastion of support for gay60issues working their way through political institutions lent their support to these efforts. TheAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal, and GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders(GLAD) crafted strategies to work these cases through the legal system and successfully litigatedthem to expand the civil rights and liberties of the LGBTQ+ community (“Romer v. Evans.” n.d.;“Lawrence v. Texas.” n.d.; “United States v. Windsor (Challenging the federal “Defense ofMarriage Act”).” n.d; “Obergefell v Hodges: Marriage Equality at the Supreme Court.” n.d.;“Bostock v. Clayton County, GA / Zarda v. Altitude Express / RG & GR Harris Funeral HomesInc v. EEOC”, n.d.).The litigation strategy utilized by organizations like the ACLU, Lambda, and GLADthroughout the course of the Contemporary Era was developed in the aftermath of Colorado’sAmendment 2 passing. In Romer it was argued that Colorado violated the equal protection clauseof the 14th amendment because the state was discriminating against people because of animmutable characteristic (Romer v. Evans 517 US 620 [1996]; Daum 2020, 34). The success ofthis argument led to, “construction of a heterosexual/gay binary that proved to be a persuasivetool for changing public perceptions thereby creating opportunities for legal change andconfirming the efficacy of the politics of rights” (Daum 2020, 34). In Romer, the Court started toaccept the idea of sexuality being a trait instead of a preference like it had ten years earlier inBowers (Daum 2020, 34-36). The sociolegal conception of a heterosexual/gay binary created inRomer was further expanded in Lawrence and Obergefell. The opinion in Lawrence upheld theheterosexual/gay binary by striking down sodomy laws because they did not depriveheterosexual couples the same way they did homosexual couples (539 US 558 [2003]; Daum2020, 35). Additionally, in 2015, the decision in Obergefell further cemented theheterosexual/gay binary (Daum 2020, 34).61The strategy used by Lambda, the ACLU, and GLAD was created on the basis of thefalse dichotomy of people being either heterosexual or homosexual. The consequence of theCourt reducing the sexuality to a false binary is the signaling that, “homonormativity [is] a viablepolitical and legal mechanism for advancing gay rights” (Daum 2020, 35). Court createdhomonormativity is the result of Romer because the Court equated same-sex relationships withdifferent-sex relationships because a norm of heterosexuality was put on same-sex relationships(Faderman 2015, 466). The legal arm of the liberal faction ran with homonormativity as amechanism to advance gay rights and created their litigation strategy around it, which situatedgay rights in a framework that, “does not contest dominant heteronormative assumptions andinstitutions but upholds and sustains them” (Duggan 2003, 50).Exclusion Part One: Judicial ActivismEven though judicial activism in the Contemporary Era has advanced gay rights to a levelthat would have been unthinkable when the movement first started, exclusion is still beingperpetuated by the liberal faction. As mentioned previously the decision in Romer created adichotomous framework to analyze human sexuality and signaled to the ACLU, Lambda, andGLAD that, “homonormativity [is] a viable political and legal mechanism for advancing gayrights,” (Daum 2020, 34-36). The liberal faction used this dichotomous framework and themechanism of homonormativity throughout the Contemporary Era to advance the rights of thosewho fall cleanly into the “homosexual” and “binary transgender” categories (Daum 2020, 34-37;Marcus 2020). The framework created by Romer and advanced in further litigation has putidentities that are not on the far end of the gender and sexuality continua in a dangerous andprecarious sociolegal position because they ignore sexual orientations that are not homosexualand alienate non-binary transgender identities (Marcus 2020, 231).62Romer v. Evans created a legal framework that rendered identities that are not on theextreme ends of the sexuality continuum unintelligible to the U.S legal system, which ironicallyexcluded bisexuality from legal protections despite being explicitly named in Amendment 2(Marcus 2020, 228). Before the decision in Romer, bisexuality, one of the identities between theextreme ends, was specifically mentioned over a dozen times in the briefs and opinions in Hurleyv. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston (515 US 557 [1995]); however, thenext year, the identity was rendered unintelligible by the Supreme Court (Marcus 2020, 228).The harms are numerous: until bisexuality is acknowledged bisexual people do not have thesame course of redress as gay people do, the lack of bisexuality in litigation makes it difficult forany precedent to be found and lawyers are less likely to take on cases concerning discriminationbecause of someone’s bisexuality, bisexuality is conflated with instability in adoption andcustody hearings, and courts have denied asylum to people because the court cannot make senseof bisexuality and does not see the person at risk of persecution because of their sexuality(Marcus 2020, 230-32).Additionally, individuals with identities that are not on one of the ends are more likely toface a lack of community, resources, a disparity in employment discrimination, mental andphysical health issues, suicide/suicidal ideation, and interpersonal violence (Marcus 2020, 233).Courts’ inability to understand bisexuality makes it harder for non-bisexual people to understandwhat it is and the unique set of issues that bisexual people face. The framework created byRomer, and advocated for and litigated by the liberal faction, not only places epistemic hurdleson society learning about bisexuality, it also actively harms the bisexual community becausecourts and greater society cannot understand the harms that bisexual people face. Thisframework makes it difficult at best and nearly impossible at worst for the bisexual community63to gain access to a community, access resources, or flee from government sanctioned persecutionbecause of the faulty epistemic frameworks being used by the legal system and society.The liberal litigation strategy grounded in the mechanism of homonormativity that wascreated and sustained by the ACLU, Lambda, and GLAD has extended the false dichotomyframework seen in the analysis of sexual orientation to sociolegal issues of gender, which erasesthe intelligibility of all of the identities that do not fall on either end of thehomosexual/heterosexual and binary cisgender/transgender continua. The creation of thisunintelligibility has served as a point of exclusion from the protections that have been granted toLGT persons to those whose sexuality is not homosexuality and/or those whose gender is noteither man or woman. This exclusion comes straight from the litigation strategy that allowed forthe creation and maintenance of a flawed sociolegal framework where the only sexualorientations and gender identities that can be recognized are binary ones.Identity based exclusion is not the only type of exclusion that happened as a result of theliberal faction’s successes in the Contemporary Era. LGBTQ+ identities were excluded from thepublic sphere. Lawrence, Obergefell, and Bostock exemplify this exclusion. Lawrence onlyapplied to private acts of sexuality, “[States] cannot demean [the existence of gay people] orcontrol their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime” (Lawrence v. Texas 539 US558 [2003]). This frame led to the legal system and the government to recognize homosexualitybut make it a private affair that could be regulated if it became public, “[LGBTQ+ identities]could exist free from explicit sanction so long as they did not publicly express their sexualidentities” (Engel 2019, 203). Lawrence codified society’s belief that homosexuality was aprivate endeavor, not something that could or should exist in public spaces, which meant afundamental lack of recognition for same-sex relationships.64While Obergefell opened same-sex relationships to the public sphere, it did so with thecaveat that they are only acceptable only if they fit into the rigid framework of the status quo; inorder for same-sex couples to be seen as couples and given the rights of heterosexualrelationships, they need to assimilate into a dominant institution that had been used to furthertheir oppression (Polikoff 2008, 132; Faderman 2015, 635; Daum 2020, 35). If same-sex couplesrefused to acquiesce to that caveat, then they would either go unrecognized or misrecognized bythe state (Daum 2020, 36). On the employment front, similar things happened because Bostockonly explicitly mentions homosexual, which means that bisexuality is relegated to the privatesphere for one to have the rights granted by the Court’s ruling (Marcus 2020).Institutional Reliance: Non-Judicial ActivismWhile groups like the ACLU, Lambda, and GLAD were working within the court system,the Human Rights Campaign, the NGLTF, and Freedom to Marry were working within statepolitical systems to expand non-discrimination protections in employment and expanding accessto marriage. A lot of organizing in the liberal faction outside of the courts and marriage equalityin this era was surrounding the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). With the help ofthe Human Rights Campaign, ENDA, or some variation like the Equality Act, has beenintroduced consistently throughout the Contemporary Era; however, 2007 marked an importantmilestone: it was the first time either chamber passed the bill (“U.S. House Takes Historic Stepby Passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act” 2007). The draft of ENDA created in 2007was also the first time it had included protections for gender, which would protect trans people inand entering the workforce. Regrettably, gender protections were removed from the bill with thesupport of the HRC before it passed the House (Schindler 2007; “U.S. House Takes Historic Stepby Passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act” 2007).65While success for employment happened on the national level via the Supreme Court,there was also state level success via state legislatures. By the time Bostock v. Clayton Countywas issued in 2020, 33 states and D.C. had explicit state level protections for sexual orientationor interpreted existing protections to cover sexuality and gender identity (“MovementAdvancement Project | Employment Nondiscrimination”, n.d.). With the exception of Missouri,the protections for sexual orientation and gender identity came from the state legislature (ibid).The Human Rights Campaign, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National Gay andLesbian Task Force worked together to pass LGBT workplace protections on the state level bysharing stories, fundraising, and lobbying state legislators to adopt protections (“HRC, ACLUand the Task Force Amass GLBT Workplace Discrimination Profiles to Help Pass EmploymentNo” 2007). Employment non-discrimination has been a huge mobilization area for the gay rightsmovement.No matter how many times or how long ENDA was introduced, same-sex marriage wasthe pinnacle of liberal organizing in the Contemporary Era. As the foremost lobbying body forgay rights, the Human Rights Campaign was very active during this era. Before the decision inObergefell v. Hodges, the HRC worked on the local, state, and federal levels to diversify thepeople allowed to enter in the institution of marriage (“The Journey to Marriage Equality in theUnited States - HRC”, n.d.). The HRC had deployed its highest number of organizers and spentmillions of dollars in states to legalize same-sex marriage and they were relatively successful(ibid). While the HRC was the most influential and equipped group, they were not alone on thebattlefield of marriage equality in state governments.Freedom to Marry (F2M) was formed in 2001 specifically to diversify those who couldparticipate in marriage on a national scale (Wolfson, n.d.a) In the legislature, Freedom to Marry66was successful in lobbying several states to both legalize same-sex marriage and defeathomophobic restrictions on marriage in Massachusetts, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Indiana(Wolfson, n.d.d). Freedom to Marry also utilized referenda, but less effectively, to expandmarriage (Wolfson, n.d.c). Losses on the referenda front in 2008 and 2009 painted a dismalpicture for getting people to support same-sex marriage; however, 2012 saw voters in Maine,Washington, Maryland, and Minnesota approve of same-sex marriage for the first time in historybecause of F2M’s campaigns (Joughin 2012).Exclusion Part Two: Non-Judicial ActivismLegislative fights for marriage equality and employment non-discrimination were alsofull of exclusionary practices and consequences. The exclusion in non-judicial activism, just likejudicial activism, is twofold. On the front of identity exclusion, the Human Rights Campaign islike no other. Despite having helped write gender identity protections in ENDA that would haveprovided employment protections for transgender Americans, the Human Rights Campaign waswilling to drop those protections if it meant increasing the standing of less marginally situatedidentities (Schindler 2007). When protections for gender identity were removed from ENDA in2007 every single organization in the movement that supported the bill, with the exception of theHRC, pushed democratic leaders to reinstate protections for gender identity (ibid). Even thoughthe Human Rights campaign was, “disappointed that [ENDA] did not include protections fortransgender Americans,” there was no further lobbying to get those protections back in by theHRC, which was the foremost lobbying group on gay issues in the county (“U.S. House TakesHistoric Step by Passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act” 2007; Schindler 2007). TheHuman Rights Campaign was willing to sacrifice objectionable members of the LGBTQ+community for the community’s more privileged members.67The Human Rights Campaign, along with Freedom to Marry, also showed exclusion inthe fight for same-sex marriage; however, the exclusion was not only identity based. In regardsto marriage, the HRC and Freedom to Marry were only concerned with legalizing same-sexmarriage (Wolfson, n.d.a). Only fighting for same-sex marriage but not alternatives like civilpartnerships or unions concomitantly shows identity-based exclusion and the exclusion ofalternatives for recognition. The main goal of the fight for same-sex marriage was state andfederal recognition of same-sex marriage and an extension of the benefits that come withmarriage (Wolfson, n.d.b). Even though the goal was basic recognition, both the HRC and F2Mdecided to fight for that recognition by institutionalizing homonormativity. Instead of fighting foran expansion of alternative recognition like civil unions or domestic partnerships, the HumanRights Campaign and Freedom to Marry only focused on marriage, not other forms ofrecognition (Wolfson, n.d.a).The exclusion of alternative institutions from the agenda of the HRC and F2M also meantan exclusion of people they were able to fight for. For example, people with disabilities facepenalties if they get married because more often than not, when they get married, they exceed theincome cap and will lose disability benefits as well as Medicare, all of which can be lifesaving(Mahoney 2022). The HRC and F2M’s focus on marriage is inextricable from exclusion. Eventhough marriage was available to same-sex couples, there were still members of the communitywho could not join that institution or have those benefits. Additionally, the focus on marriageactively harmed people in the LGBTQ+ community and those with other marginalized identitiesbecause when same-sex marriage bans were lifted in individual states and by the Supreme Court,the alternative institutions that were created had been disassembled in many states and theheteronormative institution of marriage was all that remained (Koch 2015).68Not only does an exclusion of alternative forms of recognition alienate certain membersof the community, it may also lead to an end of recognizing same-sex relationships. Alternativemechanisms to marriage began in Vermont as a way to give same-sex couples access to the rightsand benefits of marriage that was more palpable to social conservatives (Halloran 2013).Unfortunately, as gay marriage started to become more prominent in the United States and afterObergefell marriage alternatives started to be revoked (Koch 2015). There has been a fearamongst the community that the civil rights granted by the Supreme Court will eventually berevoked, which has not been assuaged in recent months due to Justice Thomas’ concurrence inDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (Mangan 2022). If Windsor and Obergefell areoverturned, it means that same-sex relationships would no longer be recognized in 35 states or bythe federal government, which means same-sex relationships would lose a substantial amount ofrecognition (Povich 2022).Beyond the potential for a reversal of Obergefell that would leave many same-sexcouples without recognition as well as the rights, privileges, and benefits seen in a marriage, thepush for marriage denies recognition for relationships and families because it does not provide,“just outcomes for the wide range of family structures in which LGBT persons, as well as manyothers, live” (Polikoff 2008, 84). The consequence of the liberal faction’s success on themarriage front meant a sustained unrecognition of non-traditional family structures as well thelabeling of those family structures as unacceptable (Polikoff 2008, 98). Additionally, the successof same-sex marriage has come at the expense of reforms that would have benefittednon-traditional families because mechanisms for their recognition would not have beendismantled (Koch 2015). Furthermore, organizations in the liberal faction that have fought forsame-sex marriage have replicated rhetoric from their conservative counterpart that upholds the69idea that marriage is the superior form of a long-term relationship compared to co-habitation,civil unions, domestic partnerships, etc. (Polikoff 2008, 98-99; Warner 1999, 82).Exclusion Part Three: SynthesisThe decisions in Romer, Lawrence, Obergefell, and Bostock as well as actions taken bythe HRC and F2M helped keep up exclusion of certain identities in the LGBTQ+ Movement,helped usher in a sociolegal framework that codified the belief that there needs to be aprivatization of certain LGBTQ identities, and supported the perception that marriage is superiorto other ways of recognizing a long-term relationship. These decisions and policy changes werethe direct result of litigation strategies created by organizations like the ACLU, Lambda Legal,and GLAD as well as advocacy taken on by the HRC and F2M. These court decisions andlegislative actions were not only the result of litigation strategies and advocacy, but they werealso celebrated by the organizations and the liberal factions as successes and victories eventhough they ended with identity-based exclusion, an exclusion from the public sphere that canonly end with the caveat of acquiescing to heterosexual norms and came at the expense ofrecognizing long term relationships as well as what counts as a family.Arc Toward ModerationIn this era, it is not the organizations that moderate, it's the era that does. Thecontemporary fights taken on by LGBTQ+ activists and organizations saw drastic changes withinsociety. The ACLU helped litigate Romer v. Evans, and their litigation as well as their strategyhelped lead to the creation of the framework that excluded identities that are not on the extremeends of the gender or sexuality continua (Marcus 2020, 231). Lambda Legal litigated Lawrencev. Texas, which helped create the framework that excludes gay people from the public sphere(Engel 2019, 203). Lambda also helped litigate Bostock v. Clayton County, which further70developed the framework created by Romer (590 US __ [2020]; Marcus 2020, 231). These endsare ones of moderation as they helped create a sociolegal context that, “forces individuals tolocate themselves in socially constructed diametrically opposed categories of identity” (Daum2020, 25). The decision in Romer created the framework that Daum (2020) describes above, andthat framework was sustained by both Obergefell and Bostock (Daum 2020, 26; Marcus 2020).As explained above the consequence of this litigation strategy is excluding certain identities fromthe public sphere.The radical beginnings of this movement come from the very thing that these cases werearguing against. Romer argued against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,Lawrence argued against states banning people’s ability to have sex with one another, Windsorargued against the federal government refusing to recognize same-sex marriages, Obergefellargued against state and local governments refusing to recognize same-sex marriages, andBostock argued against employers being able to fire people for their sexual orientation or theirgender identity. The moderation comes at the end of these cases. Romer created a framework thatrenders the non-extreme ends of the sexual orientation and gender spectrums unintelligible tolegal institutions, Lawrence helped sequester gayness to the private sphere, Windsor helpedcreate a homonormativity of gay marriage with the latter sustaining the framework ofdichotomous LGBTQ+ identities, Obergefell helped welcome same-sex couples to the publicsphere but at the cost of assimilation into the institution of marriage, and Bostock also helped theframework of dichotomous identities within legal institutions (Marcus 2020; Engel 2019, 201-3;Faderman 2015, 635; Polikoff 2008, 132).Furthermore, changing society to make room for people it had previously purposefullyexcluded is a radical goal, but that goal was eventually tempered. The Human Rights Campaign71fought to change society so LGBTQ+ people could exist out and proud in the workplace, but themoment objectionable members (trans people) put success at risk, the HRC was more thanwilling to disregard them (Schindler 2007; “U.S. House Takes Historic Step by Passing theEmployment Non-Discrimination Act” 2007). The fight for state and federal recognition ofsame-sex relationships also ended up revolving around assimilating the LGBTQ+ communityinto heteronormative institutions and excluding some intersectionaly situated communitymembers instead of helping create and keep alternative recognition mechanisms.The ends of the radical battles served to produce liberal ends like excluding identitiesfrom protections that were granted to other members of their community, creating ahomonormativity of marriage, and reinforcing the idea that one is either straight or gay andcisgender or transgender and male or female. The things that have been hailed as victories for theLGBTQ+ community by the liberal faction have served as ways to create homonormativity,create a legal framework of LGBTQ+ identities that codifies assimilation into dominantstructures, and erased the full spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities from being recognized bydominant powers in society.ConclusionIn order to accurately understand the forthcoming analysis of power, justice, andknowledge, it is important to understand the historical context of liberal LGBTQ+ activism,which this chapter provided. In all four eras that the LGBTQ+ Movement has been around, theliberal faction of the movement has acted in the same way: there has been an arc from radicalismto moderation, exclusion has been ubiquitous, and there has been an almost singular focus onbeing granted greater access to society via professional and political institutions. The moderateends are not surprising because the liberal faction will sacrifice some to make progress for72others, which only ends up leaving the most vulnerable in society excluded from any progressthat they have helped fight for. The focus on change through political institutions also helpsprovide for moderate ends because the political system in the United States was built on thefoundation of incremental change. All of these characteristics truly make this faction of theLGBTQ+ Movement a liberal faction because their ties to liberal democratic theory are strongand persistent. While the liberal faction is starting to improve on the exclusion front, they are stillheavily reliant on political and professional institutions to make change for the LGBTQ+community, in fact it is the seemingly singular strategy to work within professional and politicalinstitutions that does the most to tie this faction liberal democratic theory because it is byworking within these institutions that moderate ends and exclusion come from due to theinherent reliance on people who do not understand what it means to be LGBTQ+.The Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Bilitis, the Gay Liberation Front, the GayActivists Alliance, Lambda Legal, Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, the AmericanCivil Liberties Union, and numerous other organizations represent the liberal faction of theLGBTQ+ Movement. They have embodied ideals that are rooted in classical liberal democraticthought and based their strategies, practices, goals, and agendas on those ideals. More often thannot, this leads to a faction in a movement that fights for assimilation into dominant institutionsthat have helped oppress the people they are fighting for, exclude specific groups of peoplebecause they make the movement look bad, and provide moderate ends to fulfill promises ofradical change. Each of these attributes can be attributed to the organizations mentioned aboveand others that occupy the liberal faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement.73Chapter Three- The Progressive LGBTQ+ Faction: An OverviewJust like its liberal counterpart, the progressive faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement hascharacteristics that help classify and situate this faction as progressive. This part of themovement takes a much different approach to achieving an equitable society for theircommunity. To the progressive faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement, the liberal reliance onpolitical and professional institutions via civil rights strategies limits the outcomes of themovement because the end is assimilation into and a replication of dominant institutions thathave been used to oppress the LGBTQ+ community; the progressive faction wants to reformboth the society and social institutions that give rise to the oppression that the community faces(Cohen 2013, 75). For example, the progressive faction’s focus is not on the fight for opening thesocial institutions of marriage and parenthood to members of the LGBTQ+ community, it isabout reforming the very notion of what it means to be a family because the limited focus ofinclusion into these institutions leads the community to become a part of the very system thatoppresses them (Cohen 2013, 80). The disparity of the goals between the liberal and progressivefactions of the movement are not only revealed through the actions of the groups, but alsothrough what success means to them. In the liberal faction there is a definitive end: successmeans equal protections enshrined in law; however, there is no such definitive end within theprogressive faction because it is, “about practice and process rather than arrival at a singularpoint of ‘liberation’” (Spade 2015, 2).Unlike its liberal counterpart, within the progressive faction there is little reliance onpolitical and professional institutions and assimilation is not the only reason. This relationship isalmost non-existent because the progressive faction realized that the community cannot wait74decades for friendly politicians, administrators, lawyers, or professors to ally themselves with themovement; the first executive director of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis (an AIDS basedcommunity service provider) said when AIDS was the sole focus of the movement, “Until[AIDS] really got down to it… you realized they wanted you to die… You are literally left todie”(Ghaziani 2008, 80-81). Working within established institutions can only be successful if thepeople within those institutions are friendly toward the cause, which has not always been thecase as exemplified by barriers to employment, response to the AIDS crisis, and basicrecognition being denied by society. By working outside of political and professional institutions,the progressive faction is able to do for the community what society refuses to do for them.The question must then be asked: if the progressive faction rarely works within politicaland professional institutions, what do they do? The answer to that question is quite simple.Instead of focusing efforts exclusively on lobbying, fundraising, etc. the progressive factionfocuses more on mutual aid and direct action (D’Emilio 1983, 231-39; Faderman 2015, 419;Schulman 2021). Rarely will the progressive faction wait for others to act on the issues for themand they will do what they can to ease the suffering of their community themselves. Thenon-reliance on political and social institutions and participation in mutual aid and direct actionare closely related because it is the latter that replaces the former.The decreased action within political and professional institutions and a focus on mutualaid and direct action do a lot to set the progressive faction apart from the liberal one; however,the progressive faction’s penchant for inclusion is arguably the strongest factor separating it fromits liberal counterpart. It is through this inclusion that the faction is able to holistically look at theissues facing its community and address those problems. Exclusion from the movement willinherently mean that the movement will not be able to address the issues that face all of their75community. This means that while the liberal faction of the movement will mainly work forwhite cisgender homosexual men, the progressive faction will look at the needs of the entirecommunity.Similar to its liberal counterpart, the progressive faction has four distinct eras: Homophile(1950-1969), Stonewall (1969-1981), AIDS (1981-1996), and the Contemporary Era(1996-present). The defining attributes of the progressive LGBTQ+ Movement will be examinedthrough all four eras in order to get a comprehensive and chronological understanding of theprogressive faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement and why it is classified as the movement’sprogressive faction.The Homophile Era: 1950-1969The progressive faction of the movement was still mainly isolated to the early years ofthe Mattachine Society. There is one period of progressivism with the Mattachine Society itselfwhich lasted from its founding in 1950 until May of 1953; however, the periodical that wasassociated with the Mattachine Society, ONE, helped the progressive side of the organizationstay around after Mattachine’s 1953 convention. Toward the end of this era, another organizationwas created called the Erikson Educational Foundation that helped one of the most marginalizedmembers of the LGBTQ+ community: transgender individuals (Nownes 2019, 27).ONE, Inc.As mentioned in the previous chapter, after their Convention in May of 1953, theMattachine Society took an accommodationist turn. They stopped any and all forms of directaction, questioned the involvement of women within the movement, and they started to activelylook toward doctors, lawyers, and policy makers, instead of themselves, to change society’sperception of homosexuality (D’Emilio 1983, 75-91). While Mattachine’s leadership may have76taken a liberal turn after 1953, their publishing arm did not follow suit. After the liberal overtakeof Mattachine in May of 1953, Dale Jennings became ONE’s editor and Chuck Rowland was oneof the editorial’s main contributors (D’Emilio 1983, 87). Jennings and Rowland, with the help ofothers, filled the pages of ONE with articles that were harshly critical of the new direction takenby Mattachine as well as the philosophy of the organization’s leadership and maintained severalprogressive ideas like gays and lesbians being the ultimate authority on homosexual life andhomosexuality is not a medical problem that could be cured (D’Emilio 1983, 87-88).ONE was publishing critiques of the Mattachine Society, ran stories on issues thataffected homosexuals, and was a forum of discussion for homosexuals (D’Emilio 1983, 88-89).While the critiques of Mattachine stopped in 1955 with the departure of Rowland and Jennings,ONE kept publishing progressive ideas (D’Emilio 1983, 87). Even though it did not organize inthe traditional sense, the three tenets of a progressive movement are present. There was noreliance on political and professional organizations to get out their message and they activelypublished articles that attacked Mattachine for taking that direction, ONE actively sent themessage that gay people need to make a better life for themselves and waiting for others to do itfor them would only lead to trouble, and ONE published articles and debates on a wide array ofissues that could resonate with almost all of its readers (D’Emilio 1983, 88). ONE helped keepthe progressive message alive after Mattachine moved from progressivism to liberalism.Arguably, the most progressive aspect of ONE is its existence. It is a prime example of creatingalternative institutions that provide services to communities that mainstream institutions ignore.The Erickson Educational FoundationThe Erickson Educational Foundation (EEF) was founded in 1964 by Reed Erickson, atransgender man (Pettis 2015, 1). The aim of the EEF was to help fund research that was77unconventional, faced adverse physical, mental, or social conditions, or new (ibid). Thehomophile movement was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the funds provided by EEF (Pettis2015,1-2). The Erickson Educational Foundation provided substantial funding to ONE, theGender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins University, and the Harry Benjamin Foundation (nowthe World Professional Association for Transgender Health) (ibid; Nownes 2019, 27). Much ofthe Foundation’s work came from philanthropy during its early days; however, as the 1960sbecame the 1970s, the Erickson Educational Foundation, “functioned as an information andcounseling resource for [transgender people], creating a referral network of physicians andpsychologists” (Pettis 2015, 2). The Foundation also provided one on one counseling withtransgender patients, sponsored conferences focusing on gender identity, developed supportgroups, engaged in public outreach, and provided much needed education on what gender is andwhat it means to be transgender (Nownes 2019, 18). The EEF had essentially created a way fortrans people to access trans specific healthcare in the 1970s.While the Erickson Educational Foundation helped fund and create the professionalassociations for gender and sex in the United States, they also provided significant help throughdirect action. Because much of what is provided in terms of health care now for trans people wasconsidered illegal for most of the foundation’s existence (1964-1977), there was much work tobe done for transgender people to get the care they needed (Nownes 2019, 18). This work wasdone by the EEF through one-on-one counseling with trans people and creating a system ofsupport and referrals for trans people all across the country. Not only did this work helptransgender people get access to gender affirming care, but it also helped legitimize transgenderidentities and actively worked against the idea that trans women are men in dresses exploitingwomen for money. Due to the work of the Erickson Educational Foundation, transgender people,78who were routinely the victims of the most heinous behavior carried out by individuals and thestate, were able to get some kind of medical care during the early stages of the Gay Movement(Pettis 2015; Nownes 2019, 2-3 and 17).The very existence of the Erikson Educational Foundation is progressive in nature. Justlike ONE, EEF created alternatives to mainstream institutions that found a way to aid LGBTQ+people. This aid came through helping fund the homophile movement, research on gender, andtransgender healthcare as well as creating a system that gave people access to trans specifichealthcare. Reed Erikson saw a need for the LGBTQ+ community and helped fill that when itbecame evident society would not.The Gay Liberation Era: 1969-1981The second era of the movement came on June 28th, 1969, with the Stonewall Inn Riots(Faderman 2015, 172). After police raided the Stonewall Inn and arrested several of its patrons,those who were fortunate enough to escape police questioning started fighting back after beingprompted by one of the patrons who was arrested (Faderman 2015, 174). The riot lasted two daysand was all about transgender and gay individuals, especially trans and gay people of color,fighting against the New York City Police Department and a racist, homophobic, transphobicsociety that had shunned them into the margins (Faderman 2015, 175-76). For the transgenderand gay communities, this was a pivotal moment, especially for those sitting at an intersection ofgayness and/or transness and skin color. Gay people, trans people, and gay and/or trans people ofcolor were fighting back against those that oppressed them and were discriminatory towardsothers for their sexuality and gender expression. June 28th and 29th of 1969 showed thetransgender and gay communities that they can fight back against a homophobic and transphobicsociety in ways never before considered.79STAR: Street Transvestite Action RevolutionariesStreet Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) was formed by two trans women ofcolor in the 1970s after it became apparent that the new formed gay liberation movement was notgoing to help the plight of transgender individuals. While there were instances of STAR beinginvolved in political and social institutions, most of the work the organization did was in mutualaid and direct action with an emphasis on including those other organizations were happy toleave behind. While STAR was only around for three years, the organization has massiveimportance within the movement (Cohen 2009, 90-155).While the Gay Liberation Front ceased being a radical organization a year and a half afterbeing formed, the group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries did not suffer the same fate.STAR was formed by Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, two trans women of color, toadvocate for transgender individuals with an emphasis on those who were homeless (Daum2020, 137). The group was one of the first LGBTQ+ mutual aid organizations in the UnitedStates and was interested in the “Practical needs of gay and transgender people” (Nownes 2019,21). STAR had a huge emphasis on helping homeless trans people in New York City by givingthem food and shelter (Cohen 2009, 90). The mutual aid provided by STAR cannot beunderstated. By housing young transgender and gay individuals and letting them explore theiridentities that society had ostracized, STAR improved the quality of life among one of the mostvulnerable populations of the LGBTQ+ community. Not only did this allow those who were leftto the streets to have shelter and escape both sex work and drugs, it provided transgender youthwith affirmation (Cohen 2009, 91-92). Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, “fosteredself-reliance that enabled transvestites to both publicize the underlying causes of oppression andcollectively fight back” (Cohen 2009, 92).80STAR also participated heavily in direct action to address social injustice and demand asocial revolution. STAR had set its sights on lethal prison conditions, police harassment, harmfullegal and mental health systems, as well as discrimination in housing and employment (Cohen2009, 92). To address the problems found in the previously mentioned targets, STAR organizedpickets, visited prisons, published the mistreatment of inmates, signed letters indictingorganizations for harassment, testified in favor of a gay rights bill, wrote articles for theliberation press, and ran a gay community center (Cohen 2009, 92-93). Street TransvestiteAction Revolutionaries was also an extremely inclusive organization who fought with othergroups and members of the movement to make it more inclusive (Cohen 2009, 93). STAR alsopublished a lot of early queer theory in an attempt to get people to understand the experiencesthat transgender people had and they life they were relegated to in hopes that it would change forfuture generations (Cohen 2009, 95-103).While the group was involved and supportive of and involved in efforts that workedwithin political and social institutions, that does not prevent STAR from being a group belongingto the progressive faction of the movement. A majority of the work that STAR engaged in wasgeared more towards direct action and mutual aid than lobbying political bodies or being a forcewithin politics (Cohen 2009, 93). Because Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries wasinvolved in pickets, letter writing campaigns, housing homeless gay and trans youth, fightingwith the Gay Activists Alliance and the Gay Liberation Front to make the movement moreinclusive, and so much more, the organization rightly belongs in the progressive faction of themovement.There is a difference between seeing the necessity of acting within political, professional,and social institutions to make important changes for a community while also engaging in mutual81aid and/or direct action and only working within political, professional, or social institutions.STAR is a great example of the former. They realized that in order to change prison conditions ordiscrimination in work and housing for gay and trans people, they needed to work withinpolitical systems to do so, but they also realized that in order to make sure that needs of homelessgay and transgender youth were being met working with institutions was not going to yieldfavorable results.Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries is one of the earliest organizations within themovement that was truly progressive from when it started until it ended. STAR did not relysolely on political, social, or professional institutions to make social change, its membersparticipated in direct action and mutual aid, and most importantly the organization fought withinthe movement so it could be as inclusive as possible and not see trans people and trans people ofcolor as expendable, which the movement was wont to do during the 1970s. The work of STAR,as short as the organization’s life span was, was important in the early stages of the transgenderand gay liberation movement because it showed the community the power that they have andwhat they are able to accomplish if its members are willing to work together to help each other.Lavender MenaceWhen women left the Gay Liberation Front 18 months after it had been founded, theyformed their own organization to deal with the intersection that lesbians sat at in the GayMovement and the Women's Movement. In the Gay Movement women's issues had been, fornearly two decades, dismissed. The Gay Movement did not care about issues facing lesbians andthe Women's Movement did not care that much either, in fact the National Organization forWomen did not believe that lesbian needs should be included in the organization because theywere a threat to getting any traction for the Women's Movement (Friedan 2001, 222; Faderman822015, 233). Lavender Menace was only around for a short period of time before changing theirname to Radicalesbians, which was covered in chapter one. Before the change to beingRadicalesbians, Lavender Menace had one goal: get the mainstream Women's Movement torecognize lesbian issues (Faderman 2015, 236).Lavender Menace was successful at getting the National Organization for Women(NOW) to recognize lesbian issues and the fact that lesbians are inherently situated at theintersection of two marginalized identities: gayness and womanhood. At the second congress tounite women in 1970, a group of lesbians held the congress hostage in order to get the membersof NOW to listen to what it is like to be a lesbian (Faderman 2015, 236; Marotta 1981, 244).Members of the Lavender Menace distributed their manifesto The Woman Identified Woman,which was critical of the direction NOW was taking and gave ideas on how to integrate lesbiansinto the movement (Marotta 1981, 241-43). Members also shared stories of the lesbianexperience so attendees of the second congress would understand what it meant to be a womanand a homosexual. The reason Lavender Menace belongs to the progressive faction is becausethey worked towards getting the Women's Movement to increase the scope of the issues theywould fight for; Lavender Menace got the Women's Movement to recognize the issues facingpeople sitting at the intersection of woman and homosexual.The Transsexual/Transvestite Action OrganizationMost of the research into post-Stonewall organizing that happened in the gay andtransgender communities has been documented in New York City. While it was a hub fororganizing to be sure, it should not be the sole center of attention. Thanks to theTranssexual/Transvestite Action Organization (TAO) transgender organizing was brought to LosAngeles and Miami (Nownes 2019, 21). Unfortunately, not much is known about TAO; however,83the evidence that exists of the organization shows that it belongs in the progressive faction. Theaim of the organization was to amplify and support trans voices, which was achieved through thepublication of the Magazines Mirage and Moonshadow (“Angela Lynn Douglas and TranssexualAction Organization | ONE Archives”, n.d.). The organization, much like Lavender Menace,fought to increase the scope of what the feminist movement focused on by combatting theexclusion of trans women from groups and advocacy efforts (ibid).While in Los Angeles, the Transsexual Action Organization had organized severalconfrontational protests and street demonstrations, with the most popular ones being the timeAngela Douglas, the founder of TAO, and another trans person blocked the entrance to ashowing of the movie Myra Breckinridge and when TAO protested LA’s welfare offices becausethey refused to aid, “men who dressed as women” (Meyerowitz 2004, 238). The organizationalso convinced California’s Peace and Freedom Party to add a plank to its platform calling forpeople being able to use their body however they see fit (ibid). The most progressive part of theTranssexual Action Organization is the support the organization had for women’s and gayliberation because, “all victims of prejudice and discrimination must work together to change thissociety” (ibid).In 1972 Douglas moved to Miami and set up a new branch of the organization, whichincluded many Cuban and Puerto Rican members (Meyerowitz 2004, 239). In Florida, TAOspent most of its time trying to end police harassment of trans women. It had set up a securityforce and publicized the mistreatment of trans women in the city (ibid). The Transsexual ActionOrganization also took aim at the American Psychological Association after it had removedhomosexuality from its list of mental disorders and demanded that, “transsexualism [beremoved] from its list” (ibid). Douglas’ successor as president of TAO stressed the importance of84people listening to the experiences of trans people because the trans community’s biggest enemywas the ignorance that society had about “transsexualism”; she had also criticized the cost oftransitioning and employment discrimination that those who transitioned experienced(Meyerowitz 2004, 240-41).While the Transsexual Action Organization did spend time working with political andprofessional institutions by lobbying political parties and the American PsychologicalAssociation, it still belongs in the progressive faction because they did more than lobby thoseorganizations and there is a distinct lack of exclusion in the organization. TAO took action intoits own hands by picking up where the media stopped via publicizing what life was like as a transperson during the 1970s, TAO also criticized the media’s creation of a transnormativity, and theyalso tried to stop the consumption of media that was harmful by blocking the doors to the theaterthat was showing it. The organization also opened its doors to anyone who had wanted to joinand did not limit itself to only trans issues, it also focused on gay and women’s issues. While itwas around, the Transsexual Action Organization worked towards the liberation of trans people,women, and gay people while being cognizant of the intersectionality that people in thosecommunities experienced.The AIDS Era: 1981-1996Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, also known as AIDS, marks a turning point inpolitical action for the LGBTQ+ Movement. As mentioned in the last chapter, a majority of thework done by organizations and activists specifically to address the AIDS crisis is the epitome ofprogressive organizing and political action in the LGBTQ+ Movement. Organizations like theAIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and the Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC) werefighting to get society and the government to understand the reality of life as a non-straight85person during the AIDS Crisis, they organized help for those in need, and they picked up wherethe government and society left off (Shilts 1987; Schulman 2019). It is important to note that, inaddition to education, direct action, and mutual aid, these organizations and activists did interactwith the government by protesting its inaction and, in the case of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis,worked with the government to gain a better understanding of AIDS and how to treat it: theseorganizations and activists were the experts on AIDS, they just worked on getting theirknowledge out (Ghaziani 2008, 80; Schulman 2019).AIDS organizing facilitated a marked change in the Gay Movement. It helped end thereliance on institutions that was seen by the liberal faction because the progressive faction knewthat in some cases the community cannot wait decades for friendly politicians, administrators,lawyers, professors, etc. to ally themselves with the movement (Ghaziani 2008, 80-81). WhenAIDS dominated the LGBTQ+ Movement and life in the 1980s and early 1990s, the firstexecutive director of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis (an AIDS based community service provider)recognized that existing institutions would not lift a finger to help those with AIDS even if itmeant death, “You are literally left to die” (Ghaziani 2008, 81). The progressive faction realizedthat if they work their way through political institutions as a way to act on issues affecting thegay community, the movement could very well be playing with people’s lives and helping decidewho lives and who dies.The Gay Men’s Health CrisisThe Gay Men’s Health Crisis formed in New York in January 1982 when Larry Kramerhad a meeting in his apartment with, “New York A-Gays” (Faderman 2015, 419). As Kramer andhis friends exchanged stories about what it was like to have AIDS, they came to the conclusionthat they needed to do for gay people what society was unwilling to (ibid). Unlike its liberal86counterparts like the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Gay Men’s Health Crisis was, “thefirst community-based AIDS service provider” (Ghaziani 2008, 80). GMHC lived up to its goalby creating a buddy system whose members would visit people with AIDS, clean theirapartments, walk dogs, go grocery shopping, feed them, take them to the doctors, and read tothem while in the hospital (Faderman 2015, 419).Gay Men’s Health Crisis set up a hotline so people all over the country could turn tosomeone for advice, ran therapy groups, and got lawyers to write wills and fight landlords whowanted to evict tenants with AIDS (ibid). The work done by GMHC was all about mutual aidand making sure that people with AIDS were able to live in relative comfort in their dying days.Gay Men’s Health Crisis has worked with political institutions more than once; however, itsmain focus is directly supporting those with AIDS, no reliance on political institutions wasformed (“History”, n.d.). In 1983, the Centers for Disease Control requested GMHC help increating a conference to help educate the American people on AIDS (“Eleven Years of AIDS andGay Men's Health Crisis”, n.d.). Other than organizing a conference with the CDC, Gay Men’sHealth Crisis focused on mutual aid to comfort those in need. The work of GMHC spoke tomany people during the AIDS era and most of the people involved with AIDS activism preferredthe mutual aid approach (Gould 2009, 56).The Gay Men’s Health Crisis has expanded throughout the last forty years and remainsone of the most important and active organizations today providing services to people withAIDS, regardless of their sexuality, gender, race, and socioeconomic status (“History”, n.d.). GayMen’s Health Crisis has helped major cities all across the United States achieve the Joint UnitedNations Program on HIV/AIDS’ goal of 90% of people with HIV knowing their status, 90% ofpeople diagnosed with HIV having treatment, and 90% of people with HIV are virally87suppressed (“Impact”, n.d.). GMHC, despite largely focusing on mutual aid, has done a lot ofwork to help local and state governments in combating the AIDS crisis by providing care to theinfected and donating to/fundraising for AIDS research. Despite its name’s focus on gay men,GMHC was there to help anyone and everyone who might have AIDS, which the organizationhas been doing for over 40 years.The AIDS Coalition to Unleash PowerUnlike Gay Men’s Health Crisis, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP),focused on both mutual aid and direct action. During its short lifespan, ACT UP was successfulat organizing people to help their community through mutual aid and direct action. ACT UP wasbusy in the nine years it was active. From 1987 to 1996, ACT UP created a fast-track system toget sick people access to experimental drugs and forced the FDA to adopt it; it ran a campaign toget the CDC to change its definition of AIDS so women could get access to benefits; ACT UPgot needle exchanges legalized in New York City and started a service for homeless people withAIDS; it forced pharmaceutical companies and the government to change research priorities sofailed drugs were not being tested multiple times; ACT UP was instrumental in gettingresearchers to move away from the idea that one pill would cure AIDS and reconceptualizedwhat an effective treatment would be; it ended insurance exclusion of people with AIDS andconfronted the Catholic Church’s opposition to condom distribution in schools and needleexchange programs; images of ACT UP fighting back helped change the perception of peoplewith AIDS and how society saw the gay community (Schulman 2021, 9).Even though there are several accounts of sexism and racism within the AIDS Coalitionto Unleash Power, members of ACT UP listened to and learned from people who were differentfrom them so they could learn how to best help those with AIDS (Schulman 2019, 31).88Furthermore, because AIDS did not discriminate in who it infected those involved in AIDSactivism often lent their lives to the movement (ibid). There were also very few formal meetings,so ACT UP activists were spending much of their time in a casual, diverse setting, which led towhite gay men befriending and learning from women and people of color and that helped teardown some of the barriers that had prevented the LGBTQ+ community from intersectionalorganizing (Schulman 31-32). The settings and environment that ACT UP members spent mostof their time in helped create an organization that improved life for a wide array of people, notjust cisgender white gay men.The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power was, unlike similar organizations e.g., the GayLiberation Front and Gay Activists Alliance, was able to survive for a prolonged period of timewithout excluding people from the organization (Schulman 2019, 31).3 Furthermore, ACT UP, incontrast to all the organizations that preceded it, included more people to their cause as time wenton, “It is very unusual for movements or groups that are dominated by men and white people toachieve transformational victories to improve the lives of women, people of color, and poorpeople” (ibid). The accomplishments of ACT UP are vast and do include political institutions, soit is important to look at their strategies and how they are different from the strategies used bythe liberal faction.The strategies utilized by the progressive faction are an expansion of the actions of theMattachine Society in response to Dale Jennings being arrested and charged for cruising becauseACT UP was not afraid to make noise so people in power would listen to them; however, themechanisms for creating noise used by ACT UP differ greatly because they threw condoms at3 I would like to acknowledge that there is a dispute surrounding this claim as contemporaryaccounts of ACT UP, like Schulman (2019), have been accused of downplaying the role ofracism and overplaying inclusion in the organization; however, I am erring on the side ofSchulman’s (2019) account because it is one of few accessible works containing an in-depthexploration of the history of ACT UP’s activism.89elected officials, wrapped Senator Helms’ house with a condom, tried to shut down the NewYork Stock Exchange, created one of the largest and well known public art protests in history,dumped the ashes of loved ones on the Whitehouse lawn to protest the Reagan/Bushadministration’s refusal to recognize AIDS, and publicly protested the Catholic Church on EasterSunday (Schulman 2019). While ACT UP created noise so society would listen to the plight ofgay people as a result of the AIDS Crisis, it used so many different mechanisms and added to therepertoire of action taken on by the Gay Movement.Two of the main facets that separates ACT UP and earlier organizations when it comes topolitical action is the targets of the organization and their methods. Where organizations like theGLF and GAA would conduct guerilla-esque zaps and participate in/plan the occasional thattargeted the American Psychological Association and political officials, ACT UP focused theirenergy on providing social services to people with AIDS and protesting in ways that made surepeople knew what they were fighting for. As mentioned previously, members of ACT UP wouldhelp people with AIDS do mundane things like walk dogs and bring them meals; however, thatwas not the only thing that the organization did. The political arm of the AIDS Coalition toUnleash Power was very militant in nature, and they organized a wide variety of protests with themost prominent being protests on Wall Street, Cosmopolitan magazine (Cosmo), the Centers forDisease Control, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and theCatholic Church. While there are several protests that ACT UP organized and participated in, theaforementioned six had the biggest impact on the landscape of AIDS activism.There were three distinct protests on Wall Street carried out by ACT UP. The first protestwas on March 24th, 1987 to demand the FDA release drugs that will help treat AIDS, abolishdouble-blind studies that gave people with AIDS false hope, the release of all potentially helpful90drugs at affordable prices, public education to stop the spread of AIDS, policies to protect therights of people with AIDS especially in insurance, employment, and housing, and anestablishment of a comprehensive and compassionate national policy on AIDS (“ACT UP 1987Wall Street Action – List of Demands”, n.d.). The purpose of this protest was to prevent theprofiteering of AIDS at the expense of people’s lives and help expedite the process of treatingAIDS; ACT UP was partially successful because shortly after the March 24 th protest, the FDAannounced it would shorten its drug approval process by two years (“ACT UP/New YorkChronology 1987”, n.d.). Exactly one year later ACT UP returned to Wall Street to celebrate itsfirst anniversary and the notion of AIDS activism starts to gain more credibility amongst thepublic (“ACT UP/New York Chronology 1988”, n.d.). On September 14 th, 1989, ACT UPreturned to Wall Street to protest the high cost of AZT, the only effective and approved drug totreat AIDS at the time (“The ACT UP Historical Archive”, n.d.; Park 2017). As a result of theprotest, the manufacturer of AZT, Burroughs Wellcome, lowered the annual cost of treatment to$6,400 down 20% from $8,000 (“The ACT UP Historical Archive, n.d.).After ACT UP’s first protest at Wall Street, the next major activity came in January of1988. The Women’s Caucus in ACT UP protested and demanded a retraction of an article in themagazine Cosmopolitan where psychiatrist Dr. Robert Gould claimed that if women had sex witha man who had AIDS, the woman would not get infected (Schulman 2019, 385). This was theproverbial last straw for the women in ACT UP because it was perhaps the most dangerousinstallment in AIDS misinformation being spread by the media (ibid). The Cosmo protest startedwith a few women in ACT UP going to Dr. Gould’s house and asking him for a retraction andwhen he refused, the women took it back to ACT UP and men and women alike started planningthe protest (Schulman 2019, 387). The protest got a lot of media coverage that put the lies into91the public eye and started a very public discourse about women and AIDS, which eventually gotCosmo to retract the article along with an admission that it did not tell the full story of AIDS andwomen (Schulman 2019, 387-88). Moreover, the Cosmopolitan article initiated the creation of anACT UP documentary called Doctors, Liars, and Women: AIDS Activists Say no to Cosmo,which documented the lies the media was spreading about women and AIDS (Schulman 2019,386-89). ACT UP did not only protest the lies; they also created their own media to help spreadthe truth about AIDS and women.The Women’s Caucus of ACT UP was not done after Cosmo. AIDS was effecting andinfecting women, but the Centers for Disease Control refused to acknowledge the differences inhow the disease manifested itself in men and women, “For men, full-blown AIDS often caused[Kaposi’s sarcoma], while women experienced bacterial pneumonia, pelvic inflammatorydisease, and cervical cancer” (Brier 2009, 173). James Curran headed the CDC’s HIVSurveillance Project and, “characterized the disease in such a way that it was only men, and hehad created a whole program around that” (Schulman 2019, 247). The reality of this exclusionwas women being misdiagnosed, mistreated, ineligible for experimental treatment, and barredfrom getting disability benefits, which meant that women were dying of AIDS quicker than men(Brier 2009, 173). The exclusion of women from clinical trials and AIDS research prevented anykind of meaningful research from taking place because the disease could not be fully understood(Schulman 2019, 246).The protests targeting the CDC were years in the making and were the crowningachievement of ACT UP’s campaign for women with AIDS (Schulman 2019, 227). The actionsthat ACT UP took to combat the CDC’s problematic definition of AIDS included letter writing,sending Curran postcards with a target on his face, and organizing simultaneous actions at local92CDC offices all across the country (Schulman 2019, 247-48). In mid-1990, the CDC had plannedto meet with the ACLU and Gay Men’s Health Crisis to discuss women and HIV; however,neither the ACLU nor GMHC had any meaningful background on the issue at hand (Schulman2019, 257). Members of ACT UP demanded to have a seat at the table and when they wererefused, they handcuffed themselves to people who were invited because ACT UP was eithergoing to be involved or there was not going to be a meeting (Schulman 2019, 257-58). InJanuary of 1993, after countless women died or were kept in the dark about their AIDS status,the Centers for Disease Control changed their definition of AIDS because of the work done byACT UP (Schulman 2019, 263).The Centers for Disease Control were not the only government agency to be targeted byACT UP. The Food and Drug Administration was also a target. On October 11 th, 1988, ACT UPshut down the FDA for a day in an effort to combat the lengthy and exclusive process of theavailability of experimental drugs (“Police Arrest AIDS Protesters Blocking Access to FDAOffices” 1988). The success that came from shutting down the FDA meant that some of thedemands, like utilizing parallel trials, were met, but more importantly the FDA and the NationalInstitutes for Health started listening to ACT UP and included them in decision making (Crimp2011). Radical inclusion is also featured heavily in the action against the FDA. One of theparticipants was quoted as saying, “We are here for all the people with AIDS but we are also herefor all the other people with life-threatening illnesses who need drugs now” (“Police ArrestAIDS Protesters Blocking Access to FDA Offices” 1988). One of the demands of thedemonstration was, “The FDA must mandate that drug trials recruit participants from all groupsaffected by HIV infection, including women, people of color, children, poor people, IV drugusers, hemophiliacs, and gay men” (Crimp 2011). ACT UP also demanded that Medicaid and93private health insurance companies be billed for experimental drug therapies (ibid). This quoteand the two demands show that ACT UP was working to better the lives of everyone, not just thewhite gay male middle and upper class.In addition to the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration,ACT UP targeted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to protest the lengthy, secretive, andinequitable process that made it research into AIDS not as effective as it could be and reveal thefact that people were being lied to about the progress of AIDS treatment (Schulman 2019,538-40). Storming the NIH was a large undertaking with 1,500 people participating and therebeing many components to the protest, e.g., theatrical work like hanging banners from flag poles,legal pickets, and general civil disobedience on the NIH campus (Schulman 2019, 539). Thedemonstration at the National Institutes of Health was held on May 21st, 1990, and one monthlater Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID), accepted some of the demands of the demonstrators (Schulman 2019, 541). ACT UP’sDemonstration on the NIH campus got NIAID to establish the Community Constituency Group,put activists with voting power on the AIDS Clinical Trials Group and Community Programs forClinical Research on AIDS committees, increased the amount of support given to opportunisticinfection prevention and treatment research, and led to the best practice model of communityinvolvement with AIDS research, which has been the standard of medical research ever since(Schulman 2019, 540-41).One of the demands of the NIH from the flyers handed out to participants was, \"Endmedical apartheid (make treatments open to everyone, not just white gay men)” (Schulman 2019,540). This shows and inclusive element to the demonstration especially since the organizer was aman who received little feedback from the rest of ACT UP (Schulman 2019, 538). Even though94this protest and the ones targeting the FDA and the CDC were directed towards governmentagencies, this is not a mark of liberalism within ACT UP because it did not try to work withthese agencies. The main goal of ACT UP’s actions with the FDA and the CDC was not to gainan ally in government like liberal organizations wanted, it was to force the FDA and CDC tocome face to face with the very people they cast aside and refused to help. The main goal of theprotests was to let the community have better and more equitable access to life saving treatmentsand greater inclusion of people in medical research instead of focusing solely on civil rights.According to Fauci, members of ACT UP were producing “good, creative ideas” (Handelman1990).One of the protests that the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power is known for is Stop theChurch. Cardinal Joseph O’Connor was a powerful and vocal opponent of safe sex education,condom distribution, homosexuality, abortion, and needle exchange (Gould 2009, 285). TheCatholic Church represented a large and looming figure in many people’s oppression and it haddegraded people with AIDS in their hospices and made it difficult for people to be honored afterdeath (Schulman 2019, 138). Originally, those who wanted to participate would enter St.Patrick’s Cathedral wearing conservative clothes to blend in and at random intervals they wouldthrow themselves in the center aisle to symbolize those who had died from AIDS (O’Loughlin2019). However, ACT UP member Michael Petrelis blew a whistle, stood up on a pew andshouted, \"You’re killing us!” and two members took the Eucharist from Cardinal O’Connor,crumbled it in his hand, and let it fall to the floor (ibid). While nothing of import was achieved atStop the Church, that was the point. The intent behind Stop the Church was to protestO’Connor’s opposition to some of the only methods of stopping the spread of AIDS it alsoenabled ACT UP to reach the mainstream media outlets and made it nearly impossible for95society to ignore the AIDS crisis and it showed that the Catholic Church (which at the time was apowerful force in public policy) was not untouchable nor were its policy positions inviolable(Sindelar 2012).All of these previous actions were all done by the ACT UP chapter in New York City,which was the initial chapter of the organization. The Boston chapter of ACT UP was alsosuccessful at getting Massachusetts to respond compassionately to the AIDS crisis. Throughprotests, demonstrations, and negotiations ACT UP Boston was able to disseminate informationon AIDS, get the commonwealth of Massachusetts to create the first online registry of clinicaltrials for AIDS treatments, and made treatment more available (“New Acquisition: ACTUP/Boston Historical Records”, n.d.). ACT UP Boston took to die ins, sleep ins, and directdistribution of condoms and AIDS literature to people who were most likely to have a passeoutlook on AIDS (ibid). Unfortunately, much of ACT UP Boston’s archives and history havebeen lost, but from what remains, they had similar strategies and goals of ACT UP. The chapterin Chicago made significant progress combating the refusal of insurance companies to cover thecost of treatments and the sexism that permeated AIDS treatment, which helped open up accessto treatment (“ACT UP”, n.d.).While other chapters of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power existed, they fall mainlyinto the liberal category. ACT UP LA focused on civil rights issues when not supporting thenational ACT UP chapter, ACT UP Atlanta’s only meaningful action was protesting sodomylaws in Georgia, ACT UP San Francisco dissolved because of their lack of action on AIDS, ACTUP D.C’s only real action, while important because it got one of the most vitriolic senators tocome face to face with the consequences of his homophobic policy stances, was putting acondom around Senator Jesse Helms’ house, and many other chapters did not do anything96besides meet once or twice without any meaningful action besides some modest planning (Roth2017; Gould 2009; Street 2019). Despite ACT UP not having many national chapters that wereconfrontational, the organization did a lot to help those with AIDS. ACT UP created a buddysystem much like Gay Men’s Health Crisis that enabled daily tasks to be done and people withAIDS not be completely ostracized and through direct action they were able to make changes tothe way medical research is done, opened the definition of AIDS to include women, and so manyother things that have had an impact on people both with and without AIDS all through directaction and mutual aid.The Contemporary Era: 1996-PresentThe 1990s saw a decrease in AIDS activism partially because the activists weresuccessful in getting their demands met, treatments for AIDS proliferated, and AIDS activismbecame a social movement unto itself (Vaid 1995, 105). The contemporary actions of theprogressive faction fall into two categories: 1) mutual aid and direct action and 2) critiquing. Theformer is a continuation of the same strategies and goals that the progressive faction had heldsince 1950 with the latter being normative and argues for what activists and organizations shouldbe focusing their energies on instead of what is currently being done by the liberal faction.Mutual Aid and Direct ActionWithin the Contemporary Era of the LGBTQ+ Movement there have been a feworganizations that have been formed to provide aid to the community and engage in direct actionto help stop prejudice and discrimination. Groups like the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, FORGE,Southerners on New Ground, and Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement are participating indirect action and mutual aid to help fundamentally change people’s views on the LGBTQ+community.97Sylvia Rivera Law ProjectThe Sylvia Rivera Law Project (SRLP) was created by Dean Spade in 2002 (Shepard2013, 106; Nownes 2019, 125). Sylvia Rivera Law Project, “provides free legal help tolow-income people and people of color who experience gender identity and/or expressiondiscrimination” (Benjamin 2013, 107). SRLP has also worked to make sure that trans people ofcolor have a voice in its operations to make sure that SRLP can be as welcoming as it can tothose who need help (Benjamin 2013, 109). The Sylvia Rivera Law Project does engage withpolitical institutions like the Department of Homeless Services in New York City to prevent transwomen from being put into men’s shelters and represents clients in court regularly; however, theengagement of the SRLP with government institutions is not liberal as it works to actively aidtheir clients who have no choice but to interact with these institutions (ibid). Sylvia Rivera LawProject’s work comes from the communities that it serves, its agenda is based on providingimmediate relief for transgender people in poverty, and its methods are different from othernonprofit organizations (Benjamin 2013, 19; Spade 2015, 109). SRLP ensures that work is led bythose most directly impacted, uses an intersectional frame to fully understand peoples’ “vectorsof vulnerability,” models the change it seeks for society, being process oriented, developing newleaders especially amongst those who face the greatest barriers to leadership, makes change fromthe bottom up, strives for accountability and transparency to keep movements and constituenciesin the proverbial loop, and recognizes that relationships are the underlying support system of thework and change that SRLP seeks (Spade 2015, 109).Sylvia Rivera Law Project also does more than litigate precedent setting cases on behalfof impoverished transgender people, it uses training, public education, and policy reform to endstate sanctioned and institutional discrimination, violence, and coercion because of one’s gender98identity and expression (“Our Approach and Principles/Nuestras Práctica y Principios”, n.d.).The trainings conducted by SRLP are geared towards service providers and public education isgeared towards the community (“Trainings and Speaking Engagements | SRLP”, n.d.). Thetrainings for service providers revolves around making services more welcoming and accessibleto people struggling with their gender identity so they can utilize community services and gainaccess to healthcare, employment, housing, and education (ibid). Education for the communityhelps people understand their rights in interactions with the police, healthcare professionals, andimmigration institutions as well as getting name changes and updating identification documents(ibid). Even though much of the successes of SRLP that make it into the mainstream revolvearound litigation and policy efforts, Sylvia Rivera Law Project does more than interacting withpolitical institutions to change policy, it helps train and educate people providing importantservices to the community as well as people so they are safe and knowledgeable in their day today lives.Furthermore, Sylvia Rivera Law Project has measures in place that should prevent anexclusionary arc in the organization. The organization actively utilizes frames of intersectionalityto understand the oppression of the people they serve (Spade 2015, 109). This means thattransgender people, people of color, and low-income people have a strong voice within SRLP sothe organization knows what it needs to focus its energies on; SRLP also has strong connectionswith groups created by people of color to ensure that people can get help if they need it(Benjamin 2013, 107-109). The lens of intersectionality that is utilized by SRLP also means thatthey recognize that there are other causes of their constituency’s oppression, that people whoseek the services of Sylvia Rivera Law Project are experiencing discrimination and oppressionbased on their gender identity or expression, their socioeconomic status, potentially their race,99and how all of those identities combine to exacerbate the discrimination and oppression thatpeople face. Sylvia Rivera Law Project is cognizant of the fact that they are not only providingservices to transgender people, they are providing services to people of color and low-incomepeople so their litigation strategies and topics covered in trainings and education sessions aredeveloped with those identities in mind.FORGEFORGE was started in the Midwest in 1994 to connect trans-masculine people andprovide them resources to receive healthcare (“Our History – FORGE”, n.d.). Throughout itsfirst nine years FORGE steadily grew and its staff saw an increase in people revealing that theyhad been a victim of childhood sexual abuse or sexual assault as adults, which spurred FORGEto investigate the high rate of sexual violence that trans people had experienced (ibid). Since2004, FORGE has worked to research and understand the causes of all types of violence thattrans people experience and since 2011 the organization has worked on trainings so victimservice providers could better understand transgender and non-binary survivors of abuse andviolence (ibid). FORGE, much like other organizations in the progressive faction, picked upwhere society left off; they saw a need in their community and filled that need.FORGE’s main work since 2016 has been holding training for service professionals sothey can better understand how to meet the needs of transgender and non-binary clients (“OurHistory – FORGE”, n.d.). FORGE has presented and trained people at the National SexualAssault Conference, International Summit on Violence, Abuse, and Trauma, NationalConference on Health and Domestic Violence, American Society on Aging, AmericanPsychological Association Conference, Philadelphia Trans Wellness Conference, and severalstate Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Coalition conferences (“Trainings – FORGE,” n.d.).100FORGE also provides resources for transgender individuals specifically in regard to whatlegislation and court decisions means for transgender individuals (“Webinars – FORGE”, n.d.).Resources for service providers and the community as a whole are also geared toward harmreduction, not just addressing harm as it shows up. FORGE has a litany of different resources onhow to support LGBTQ+ youth as a way to prevent victimization before it starts and attempt tocreate a more welcoming society (“Protecting LGBTQ+ Youth – FORGE”, n.d.).Southerners on New GroundSoutherners on New Ground (SONG) is a regional organization in southern states that,“builds strategies for economic and racial justice through a lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender,queer, gender non-conforming, and two spirit (LBGTQTS) lens” (Lynn et al. 2010, 1). SONG isthe epitome of an inclusive organization bringing race, class, and gender analysis to LGBTQorganizing (McMichael 2014, 142). Like Lavender Menace before, SONG has worked to openthe aims of other organizations and movements by training them how to integrate issues ofhomophobia and transphobia in their work (“Our Mission, Vision & History” 2022). In additionto training others on how to integrate weakening homophobia and transphobia in their work,SONG works to help those in the LBGTQTS community who live in more rural areas becausethey face a unique set of issues that other organizations do not pay attention to (ibid). There hasbeen work with government institutions as SONG was instrumental in winning an injunction onHB 87 in Georgia a way to prevent more barriers from being erected that would deterundocumented people from seeking help from the community or organizations; however, there isno reliance on those institutions because SONG only works with them when policy willadversely affect marginalized people (ibid). SONG has shown a commitment to mutual aid anddirect action, radical inclusion, and does not have to rely on political or professional institutions.101Familia: Trans Queer Liberation MovementFamilia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement (Familia), “works at local and national levelsto achieve the collective liberation of trans, queer, and gender nonconforming Latinxs throughbuilding community, organizing, advocacy, and education” (“Familia:TQLM | Homepage”, n.d.).Familia is focused on liberation specifically for Latinxs by expanding on the work done by racialjustice and liberation movements (ibid). Familia works to provide resources that already exist forcisgender and heterosexual Latinxs to trans and queer people so they can have access to the sameopportunities and benefits of everyone else in their community (“Programs - Familia: TQLM”,n.d.). There is no history of the organization working within government institutions; however, ifthere were, it would still be a progressive organization because they mainly focus on grassrootsorganizing to bring justice to people sitting at the intersections of Latinx and queer or Latinx andtrans or Latinx and queer and trans (ibid).Progressive Critiques of the Modern EraOne of the hallmarks of the progressive faction is its drive to continuously question itseffectiveness and how it can be better, which is something that the progressive faction has beendoing extensively in the modern era (Spade 2015, 2). The critiques have held the same basicideas for decades, the only substantive change from era to era is the content. The basic critique ofthe liberal faction is its drive for legal and policy change being inadequate to achieve liberationfor the LGBTQ+ community because it keeps the basic structure of oppression intact and it leadsto assimilation into institutions that are used to further others’ oppression (ibid). Theconsequence of keeping the basic structure of oppression is twofold: 1) the reification ofLGBTQ+ identities is done through a lens of homonormativity and 2) LGBTQ+ individuals areassimilated into existing structures of oppression that are still being used to oppress other people;102while the community is able to find some escape from oppression, it comes at the cost ofstrengthening a structure that is used to further oppress marginalized peoples.The liberal faction’s end of liberation is problematic because adding sexuality to the listof protected characteristics has a reified sexuality as a dichotomy of gay/straight werenon-straight identities are seen as opposing forces to straightness; including gender identity inthe list of protected characteristics will lead to transgender identities being reified as an opposingforce to cisgender identities (Warner 1993, xii). In other words, the rights-based approach takenby the liberal faction leads to a contextualization and reification of LGBTQ+ identities through alens of cisgender and heterosexual identities. Because of this flawed framework, a rights-basedapproach will not facilitate the liberation of LGBTQ+ people because they are viewed in a waythat is not compatible with their identities or experiences with a consequence of having toconform to hegemonic social norms to be accurately recognized (Daum 2020, 157-58).Pursuing LGBTQ+ activism through political institutions to end de jure discriminationpractices, e.g., employers not being able to fire LGBTQ+ individuals simply because they areLGBTQ+, does not address the underlying force that created that mindset, nor will it allow for away for LGBTQ+ people to change homonormative structures created by elite dominant actors(Daum 2020, 35 and 158). The consequence of being confined to homonormative structurescreated by elite dominant actors is that the LGBTQ+ community cannot create their identities,interests, or needs on their own terms using their own vernacular: LGBTQ+ identities and needswill not have the ability to counteract the forces that marginalized them by working in the systemcreated their marginalization and maintains their oppression (Fraser 1990, 67). The limits of arights-based strategy was alluded to by Justice Kennedy through his majority opinions in Romer,Lawrence, and Obergefell via the creation of a sociolegal analysis that views sexuality and103gender as, respectively, gay or straight and cisgender or transgender because this analysis wouldnot contest dominant institutions and assumptions (Daum 2020, 35-36).Not only does working within the system formed by those who are dominantly situated insociety come at the cost of being governed by dominant norms and expectations, it alsoassimilates LGBTQ+ individuals into institutions that were created to exclude them and used tooppress them that are still being used to oppress marginalized people (Cohen 2013, 75). Themost prevalent example of this is marriage. When marriage was diversified to include same-sexcouples the structure and role of marriage did not change. There was no fundamental shift in theway marriage is seen nor was there a shift in the way that marriage operates in society, whichleads to the relief of oppression for some at the expense of the oppression for others (Polikoff2008, 98). Not only does this oppression affect people outside of the LGBTQ+ community, itaffects people inside the community as well. The inclusion of same-sex couples strengthens theinstitution of marriage, which leads to further unrecognition of family structures that do notinclude marriage because alternatives are weakened or dismantled (Polikoff 2008, 84; Koch2015). The strengthening of marriage and weakening or dismantling of alternatives also harmsthose at intersections of identities. Low-income people with disabilities in same-sex relationshipsare continually excluded from marriage because they are unable to get married do to theirreliance on disability benefits, which means that the strengthening of marriage strengthens theiroppression (Mahoney 2022).“Marriage, in short, discriminates” (Warner 1999, 82). Conservative rhetoric aroundmarriage being sullied by the inclusion of same-sex couples shows that the institution ofmarriage by its very nature is discriminatory. The institution of marriage has been constructed ina way that ennobles some at the expense of disparaging others, “the ennobling and the104demeaning go together” (ibid). By diversifying marriage via including same-sex couples, theliberal faction has allowed marriage to be simultaneously a way to weaken and strengthenoppression because some are able to escape oppression, but that just makes the oppression facedby those who cannot escape it even stronger. Expanding marriage to same-sex couples has led tothe maintenance of oppressive institutions and structures created by hegemonic society thatmakes members of the LGBTQ+ community who join the institution complicit in makingoppression for those who are sitting at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities evenworse.The Contemporary Era’s critique of the liberal faction is twofold: 1) the rights-basedapproach taken by the liberal faction keeps oppressive power structures in place and 2) theinclusion of LGBTQ+ individuals in institutions that have previously excluded them strengthenthe tools of oppression used by hegemonic powers. While the liberal faction is helping peopleescape oppression it is being done at the expense of strengthening the tools of oppression usedagainst those who cannot escape it.ConclusionIn order to accurately understand the forthcoming analysis of power, justice, andknowledge, it is important to understand the historical context of progressive LGBTQ+ activism,which this chapter provided. The progressive faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement has a richhistory of helping every member of their community in order to remove barriers and providingrelief from oppression that are almost ubiquitous in society regardless of the political and sociallandscape. The progressive faction has done a lot of good for their community through directaction, mutual aid, and centering the LGBTQ+ community in their work. Furthermore, theprogressive faction has been working towards liberation for all who experience oppression105because they recognize the intersectionality of the LGBTQ+ community and in order forliberation to truly occur it needs to be done universally. The progressive faction is focused onchanging the lives of all members of the LGBTQ+ community for the better, which meansfighting for change that affects other marginalized people as well. In order to do this, theprogressive faction is not working in or fighting to diversify institutions and systems that oppressthem. Instead, it is focused on transforming institutions and systems that oppress people as wellas the stigma that comes with being a member of a marginalized community all from the groundup.The early days of Mattachine and the Gay Liberation Front, ONE, the EriksonEducational Foundation, the Stonewall Riots, STAR, TAO, the response to the AIDS crisis, theSylvia Rivera Law Project, FORGE, and numerous other organizations and people represent theprogressive faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement. They are rooted in the practices of mutual aidand direct action with ideals of inclusion and liberation. The progressive faction is fightingagainst assimilationist practices of their liberal counterpart and for a liberated society for themarginalized, the oppressed, and those branded as other. There is a recognition within theprogressive faction that the work of the LGBTQ+ Movement’s work does not stop when ablebodied cis white queer people gain access to institutions that had excluded them for decades; theLGBTQ+ Movement’s work stops when the marginalized have access to institutions that haveexcluded them for centuries and when alternatives to those institutions have been created thatallow people to live their life the way they want to, not how those who are dominantly situatedthink is acceptable.106Chapter Four- Power in the LGBTQ+ MovementThe framework of power, justice, and knowledge introduced in chapter one is a usefulway to examine the effective change brought by the actions of the liberal and progressivefactions of what has come to be known as the LGBTQ+ Movement. This chapter will provide areview of Lukes' (2021) framework of power and how it is reified in the liberal and progressivefactions of the LGBTQ+ Movement and its predecessors. As mentioned in chapter one, the lensof power allows for an evaluation of the change made by the two factions because facilitatingpolicy and social change requires power. By looking through such a lens when evaluating theeffects of social movements, one is able to see the changes that movement has made and whatchanges it is capable of making. The analysis of power in the liberal and progressive factionswill show that the liberal faction’s capacity for power is limited compared to its progressivecounterpart’s. The liberal faction has ample capacity to act within both the first and seconddimension of power (respectively, power over observable action and power over agenda setting),but limited capacity to act within the third dimension (power over ideology); however, theprogressive faction is able to work within all three dimensions to influence people’s observableaction, others’ agendas, and ideology both internal and external to the movement.Power RevisitedLukes (2021) provides a comprehensive framework with which to view power. Thisframework consists of three dimensions provided by, respectively, Dahl (1957), Bachrach andBaratz (1970), and Lukes (2021). Each successive dimension dives deeper under the surface ofwhat power is than the last. The first dimension of power examines the ability to influenceobservable action, “A has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do something that B107would otherwise not do” (Dahl 1957, 80). The second dimension of power examines the abilityto influence agendas, “Power is also exercised when A devotes his energies to creating orreinforcing… practices that limit the scope of the political process to public consideration ononly those issues which are comparatively innocuous to A” (Bachrach and Baratz 1970, 7). Thethird dimension of power examines the ability to influence ideology:is it not the most supreme and insidious exercise of power to prevent people… fromhaving grievances by shaping their perceptions, cognitions and preferences in such a waythat they accept their role in the existing order of things because they can see and imagineno alternative to it (Lukes 2021, 33)The third dimension of power has negative and positive reifications. The former happens whenideological influence helps maintain oppression and the latter happens when the ideologicalinfluence that furthers the goal of social movements. The dimensions of power provided byLukes (2021) are, respectively: 1) influence over behavior, 2) influence over agenda setting, and3) influence over ideology (Lukes 2021, 19-33). It is through these dimensions of power that theliberal and progressive factions’ ability to facilitate change is understood.Power in the Liberal FactionThe capacities of power in the liberal faction of the movement are easy to ascertain.Within this framework, the liberal faction can act within both the first and second dimension ofpower, but a restricted ability to act within the third dimension.4 The liberal faction has been ableto get state actors and social institutions to behave in ways that they otherwise would not, whichshows their capacity to influence observable behavior; it has also been able to control portions ofthe political agenda, their progressive counterpart, and some organizations within the liberalfaction have been able to influence the agendas of the political sphere, the progressive faction,4 Respectively, influence over observable behavior, agenda setting, and ideology.108and other organizations within the liberal faction; there is a capacity to work within the thirddimension, but that activism has begun to do more harm than good.Power Over Observable ActionThe liberal faction has shown its ability to influence observable action through what ithas done and their reliance on political and professional institutions. As mentioned in chaptertwo, the liberal faction works within existing political and professional institutions in an effort togrant the community access to social institutions. By working within political and professionalinstitutions to initiate social change, the liberal faction is only successful to the extent that theinstitutions are malleable enough to be influenced by organizations and activists. Throughconcerted efforts of lobbying politicians and political institutions, the liberal faction has beenable to get legislation that protects the LGBTQ+ community in the realms of housing,employment, public accommodation, and laws banning gay and trans panic defenses written andin most cases passed (Faderman 2015). It is because of the lobbying efforts and pressurecampaigns taken on by the liberal faction that these pieces of legislation have been created and inmost cases enacted (Faderman 2015, 250). Additionally, the liberal faction’s zaps against theAmerican Psychological Association were able to get homosexuality declassified as a mentalillness and recognized as a valid expression of human sexuality (Adam 1995, 88).The liberal faction’s ability to influence observable behavior does not stop at its ability toguide the actions of professional and political institutions. The liberal faction has also shown anability to influence the behavior of individuals. Dress codes imposed by the Daughters of Bilitisshow a capacity to influence people’s actions and behavior in the movement because they actedand behaved in ways they otherwise would not (D’Emilio 1983, 106). Beyond aesthetics, theliberal faction has influenced behavior of people in the LGBTQ+ community via the109advancement of normativities. The liberal faction has advanced, sustained, and amended severaldifferent normativities that influence people’s actions. The most prevalent examples are thehomonormativity furthered by the Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Bilitis, the GayLiberation Front, and later institutionalized by the ACLU, Lambda Legal, GLAD, the HRC, andF2M. The homonormativity that exists today that has been crafted over the last 69 years hasinfluenced the behavior of generations of the LGBTQ+ community by creating andinstitutionalizing an ideal way for members of the community to behave, present themselves, andhow their relationships manifest.The advancement of homonormativity started after the Mattachine Society’s conferencein 1953. The new leadership of Mattachine overhauled the organization and took on the idea thatthe only difference between the homosexual and the heterosexual is their sexuality (D’Emilio1983, 84). The Daughters of Bilitis took that normativity and pushed it to the extreme bypostulating that the only acceptable lesbian presented and acted femininely that maybe had anon-blue-collar job (D’Emilio 1983, 92-107). The image of the ideal homosexual conjured byMattachine and the DOB was propagated by the publishing arm of the organizations and in atime when homosexuality was seen as a pathology, illness, or moral defect, any way ofdestigmatizing one’s sexual proclivities was actively sought out (D’Emilio 1983, 109-13; Woods2017, 146). This early iteration of homonormativity developed by the homophile movement wasinfluential to the homosexual population of the 1950s and 1960s, which undoubtedly causedpeople to act in ways they otherwise would not (D’Emilio 1983, 103).The image of the ideal gay man was further developed by the Gay Liberation Front whenthey tried to combat the fairy stereotype by overcompensating in masculinity that dictated howpeople dressed, talked, and looked like (Kissack 1995, 111). The implications of this110overcompensation cannot be understated. Even though society had lessened its hostility towardgay people throughout the 1960s, finding a place where it was okay to be gay was rare. The GLFprovided one of those places with the caveat of hypermasculinity and pushed the idea thatgayness is fine as long one is not simultaneously transgressing gender norms (Kissack 1995,120-22). The AIDS crisis saw a concerted effort to create domestic partnership laws in theUnited States that effectively pushed the idea that gay couples are just like heterosexual ones(Chambers 1992, 184-85). The ACLU, the HRC, and F2M did not only develophomonormativity that was provided by its predecessors, they institutionalized it in theContemporary Era through dismantling alternatives to marriage like civil unions (Koch 2015).By fighting to legalize same-sex marriage federally and in the states, the aforementionedorganizations institutionalized homonormativity because their success meant a dissolution ofcivil unions and companies ending policies that gave employees’ same-sex partners benefits,which left the only option for recognition and benefits of marriage (Koch 2015). Furthermore,the institutionalization of marriage privileges dual partnerships and the traditional familystructure at the expense of other valid forms of family creation and partnership (Polikoff 2008,84).Liberal organizations’ tendency to exclude people has manifested the use of power overbehavior. Because Mattachine focused on issues that were only salient to gay men andquestioned the involvement of women in the homophile movement, they influenced Del Martinand Phyllis Lyon’s behavior to create the Daughters of Bilitis (D’Emilio 1983, 92-93). The DOBis not the only organization that was created as a result of exclusion. Because they were turnedaway from both the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance on account of theirtrans and racial identities, Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera formed the Street Transvestite111Action Revolutionaries (Daum 2020, 137). The exclusion of lesbians from GLF and GAA alsospurred the creation of the Lavender Menace, which eventually became the Radicalesbians(Faderman 2015, 232). In an odd twist, inclusion also created an organization. The Gay ActivistsAlliance was created by members of the Gay Liberation Front who were disgruntled by theinclusion of racial justice in the Gay Movement (Bronski 2011, 212). Exclusion of people fromthe liberal faction influenced the behavior of those who were excluded because that was thecatalyst of creating many liberal organizations as well as STAR; the inclusion of racial issues inthe GLF influenced people’s behavior because that was the catalyst that led to the creation of theGAA (Bronski 2011, 212; D’Emilio 1983, 92-93; Daum 2020, 137; Faderman 2015, 232).Power Over Agenda SettingVia the liberal faction’s focus on a rights-based framework and reliance on institutions,they have revealed an ability to wield influence over agenda setting. Through getting local, state,and federal legislators to write policy that protects the LGBTQ+ community, the liberal faction isalso influencing the agenda of these institutions. When these pieces of legislation are submittedto their respective bodies, they are scheduled for committee hearings, committee votes, andoftentimes floor votes (Ghaziani 2008, 204-6). However, this ability does not only come throughgetting these bills written and on a legislative or judicial agenda by influencing actors withinlegislative bodies, it also comes through acts like coming out, vigils, and testimony. WhenMassachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy heard that people were losing their jobs because theywere coming out he helped re-introduce the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 1994, twodecades after it was first introduced (Faderman 2015, 429).Agenda setting is not only present in legislatures it is also present in ballot initiatives andprofessional institutions like the American Psychological Association. With success in getting112states to legalize same-sex marriage, the Human Rights Campaign and Freedom to Marry tookstate organizing one step further and turned to referenda when state legislatures were deadlocked(Wolfson n.d.c). The HRC and F2M influenced the agenda of state ballot initiatives throughmobilizing for the legalization of same-sex marriage. Agenda setting power was not onlyexercised in the political realm. The series of zaps aimed at the American PsychologicalAssociation put declassifying homosexuality as a mental illness on that organization’s agenda.Furthermore, second dimensional power is not only exercised through explicit politicalmobilization. Society’s public mourning after the murder of Matthew Shepard in 1998 causedstate and federal legislators to focus on hate crimes legislation (Ghaziani 2008, 222). Throughlobbying, coming out, zapping, and public acts of mourning, the liberal faction has shown anability to exert power in the political arena by influencing potential action taken in that space.Power over agenda setting is also used, unknowingly, to influence what future eras andother factions do. Due to Mattachine and the DOB focusing on reading groups and working withprofessionals to make change, the Gay Liberation Era organizations put protesting back on theliberal faction’s agenda because they saw what happens without active mobilization (Marotta1981, 71). This also happened with Lambda Legal. Lambda was able to craft a litigation strategythat was successful in obtaining a gay friendly Supreme Court decision in 1996, whichinfluenced the political action and strategy of the liberal faction moving into the new millennium(Engel 2019, 200). Furthermore, the liberal faction, knowingly or not, has influenced the actionsof the progressive faction. Progressive organizations like the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACTUP had a lot thrust upon them by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force’s strategy ofde-gaying AIDS (Vaid 1995, 75). Because the liberal faction decentered gayness in their AIDSmobilization, they put advocating for gay people with AIDS on the progressive faction’s agenda.113By intentionally acting or not acting on specific things, organizations in the liberal faction haveinfluenced the agenda of other liberal organizations as well as organizations in the progressivefaction. It is by exerting this control over the agenda of others that second dimensional power isexercised by the liberal faction.Ideological PowerThere are some instances of the liberal faction influencing people’s ideology. Somepotential successful exercises of third dimensional power in the liberal faction came from thecreation of homonormativity, lobbying, zaps, and public interviews. The creation andmaintenance of homonormativity that is seen in the liberal faction is a negative influence ofideology whereas lobbying, zaps, and public interviews are positive influences. Unfortunately,negative ideological power is more prevalent in this faction.The creation and maintenance of homonormativity has continued to this day as a result ofliberal activism (Daum 2020, 35). This is a negative influence over ideology because it does notfree people from oppression, which is the goal of both factions of the movement.Homonormativity can, just like the hypermasculinization of homosexuality in the Gay LiberationFront, create a society that removes the stigma of LGBTQ+ identities while simultaneouslyenforcing standards one has to meet to be valid, i.e., homonormativity creates an environment ofsimultaneous freedom and oppression. Homonormativity that was developed by the liberalfaction influenced the way that people within the community thought about themselves and theiractions because they want to conform to the standard placed on them. The creation ofhomonormativity and the active practice of admonishing those who do not fit into thatframework is an influence of people’s ideology because it shapes perceptions in, “such a waythat they accept their role in the existing order of things because they can see and imagine no114alternative to it” (Lukes 2021, 33). In other words: the creation of trans- and homonormativitiesinfluences the way people think about the LGBTQ+ community.As far as lobbying, Frank Kameny’s interactions with the ACLU do provide a compellingpotential for positively influencing ideology. In 1958, the ACLU, “was on record supporting theconstitutionality of sanctions against homosexuality because…the government had the right toregulate behavior” (D’Emilio 1983, 48). However, in 1962 Frank Kameny convinced the ACLUto instigate legal challenges to the ban on homosexual employment in the Civil ServiceCommission (D’Emilio 1983, 155). While there is no way to know for sure if Kameny was ableto change the ideology of the ACLU or if the organization had changed its mind on its own viainternal processes, but the potential for the exercise of third dimensional power does exist withMattachine’s interactions with the ACLU.Zaps also show the liberal faction positively influencing people’s ideology. By getting theAmerican Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from their list of mental disordersand being able to defend homosexuality in front of a national audience, the GAA influencedideology. Conventional “wisdom” during this time said that homosexuality was a disease, a sin, amanifestation of leading an unethical life (Rubenstein 1995, Abstract). Through the removal ofhomosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, homosexualitywas no longer seen by professionals, as a psychopathy and paved the way for future generationsto no longer see homosexuality as a mental disorder, which is liberal action influencing people’sideology (Turner 2017). Zaps in general influenced people’s ideology. As eloquently provided byJim Fouratt at the founding meeting of the GAA, “Sweet? Bullshit! There’s the stereotype homoagain, man! . . . Bullshit! That’s the role society has been forcing these queens to play, and theyjust sit and accept it”, in other words, society thought gay people to be weak and ineffectual (Teal1151971, 28). However, the zaps changed society’s mind. Gay people were showing society thatthey were neither weak nor ineffectual because they were fighting against governmentsanctioned oppression and winning (Faderman 2015). This facilitated a change in society’sattitude towards gay people because society was seeing gay people fight the system and win.Through a public interview, the Gay Activists Alliance was also able to change society’sminds about lesbians. Society had this idea that lesbian activism was nothing to take seriously,that lesbians were less important than gay men (Marotta 1983, 286). However, the interview withJack Paar Tonite helped change that notion. Not only was a lesbian able to voice her experienceon national television, she did so after Jack Paar tried to silence her (ibid). The Gay ActivistsAlliance knew that lesbian activism was nothing to ignore, so they made sure a lesbian wasincluded in the first opportunity to get visibility for experiences of the LGBTQ+ community.Through the inclusion of women in the GAA, society’s outlook on lesbians changed. Theinterview showed the world the role lesbians played in an ever-growing social movement thatwas fighting against government sanctioned oppression and winning (Capsuto 2020).The reason the liberal faction is unable to consistently wield positive power over others’ideology is the issues it decides to act on. With few exceptions, the liberal faction concerns itselfwith symptoms of the phenomena, e.g., homophobia, which gives rise to the issues the liberalfaction combats (Vaid 1995, 75). Working within the third dimension of power meansinfluencing people’s ideologies and the way they think (Lukes 2021, 34). Without combating theroot causes of the disparate treatment faced by the LGBTQ+ community, the ability of the liberalfaction to work within the third dimension of power is limited because the root causes of thedisparate treatment are ideological. Homophobia, transphobia, etc. are all ideologies that peopleuse to view society, see what an ideal world looks like, and form policy opinions from. By116focusing on the consequences of these ideological phenomena, the liberal faction is not able towork positively in the third dimension because ideology is not being influenced in a way thatfrees people from oppression. The majority of the third dimensional power wielded by the liberalfaction has been negative because while it does create an environment with less of a stigmasurrounding LGBTQ+ identities, that environment is also oppressive if those identities are notreified in a way that conforms to the normativity that has been created.Power in the Progressive FactionUnlike the liberal faction, the progressive faction has the capacity to consistently wieldinfluence over observable action, agenda setting, and positive influence over ideology in theframework provided by Lukes (2021). Through the action of the progressive faction, peopleacted in ways they otherwise would not, items have been placed on agendas, and ideology hasgone through a metamorphosis.Power Over Observable ActionThe actions of the progressive faction have gotten people to behave in ways that theyotherwise would not have, both in and out of positions of authority. Influence over observableaction is something that has been exercised by the progressive faction since its inception.When the Gay Liberation Front was still a member of the progressive faction of themovement, it espoused diametrically opposed ideals and strategies for social change than whathad been utilized by Mattachine and the DOB. Through a desire to be inclusive and return tograssroots organizing, the Gay Liberation Front undoubtedly got people in the LGBTQ+community involved in the Gay Movement because it was more welcoming for people who didnot fit the rigid conceptualization of the ideal homosexual and homosexual activism that wassought by the GLF’s predecessors (Marotta 1981, 91). While the Gay Liberation Front does sit117squarely in the liberal faction, it was not always this way. For the first year and a half of itsexistence the GLF was a progressive organization.Getting people to join the movement and become activists were not the only ways theprogressive faction was able to influence behavior. Lavender Menace was able to get theNational Organization for Women to recognize the inherent intersectionality that exist withinlesbians (Marotta 1981, 244). Lavender Menace got NOW to change their attitudes towardslesbians and incorporate their struggles in the greater Women's Movement. TheTranssexual/Transvestite Action Organization was also able to influence behavior. Through thework of TAO transgender issues were brought into the political realm (Meyerowitz 2004, 238).By organizing, campaigning, and some lobbying, TAO was able to get California’s Peace andFreedom party to add a plank to its platform calling for complete bodily autonomy to allowpeople to transition with as little governmental burden as possible (ibid).The litany of ways the progressive faction has been able to reify first dimensional poweris best exemplified by the AIDS Activism. Both the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and the AIDsCoalition to Unleash Power increased the number of activists in the movement, changedprofessional practices, and changed social responses to issues affecting society (Schulman 2019,9). These activities, which are detailed below, are exercises of first dimensional power becausethey influence behavior.When the progressive faction started organizing around the AIDS crisis, they helpedmembers of the gay community realize that, even if they could pass as straight, they needed to dosomething to help (Ghaziani 2008, 80-81). Because the progressive faction of the movement hadcoupled AIDS with gayness, people who otherwise would not have been involved in themovement started showing up to ACT UP meetings, joined the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, and118participated in public demonstrations (ibid). ACT UP also protested the progress in AIDSresearch and treatment being frustratingly slow and ineffective. These demonstrations served as acatalyst for renewed research and increased access to AIDS treatment by getting treatmentproviders to lower the cost of treatment (Schulman 2021, 9). Perhaps the most important work offirst dimensional power was getting the NIH and FDA to move away from a one-pill AIDStreatment strategy and looking into multi-pill treatments (Schulman 2019, 9).ACT UP was also able to get people with AIDS health insurance coverage by advocatingfor an end to the policy that prevented HIV positive people from being covered, which changedpeople’s behaviors because more people with AIDS were finally able to access medical care andmedical staff treated more people with AIDS due to the former finally being able to access healthinsurance and healthcare. The Women’s Caucus of ACT UP was also able to combat dangerousmisinformation provided by medical professionals and got medical professionals to change howAIDS was viewed and how it would show up in women (Schulman 2019, 247; Brier 2009, 173).By protesting and fighting with medical professionals, the Women’s Caucus was able to getwomen included in clinical trials, something that had been actively resisted for years andprovided a means of conducting gender inclusive research into AIDS and AIDS treatment (ibid).ACT UP’s activism not only had power over people's behavior in regards to the AIDS crisis, butthe entire medical field. Inadvertently, the progressive faction also helped change patientadvocacy within healthcare by convincing medical practitioners and people studying AIDS tolisten to the needs of their patients (Aizenman 2019).In the Contemporary Era there is also influence over observable action to be seen inSoutherners on New Ground and Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement. Most of the workdone by these organizations is reminiscent of Lavender Menace’s. SONG’s main activity is119training other organizations and movements to integrate combatting homophobia and transphobiain their work (“Our Mission, Vision & History” 2022). In addition to training other organizationsand movements, SONG is able to get people in rural areas to become LGBTQ+ activists, whichis something that may have never been considered before because of how little attention is givento LGBTQ+ people in rural areas (ibid). Familia are able to get queer and/or trans Latinxs to useresources they otherwise would not have because now queer and trans friendly options areavailable (“Programs - Familia: TQLM”, n.d.).Power Over Agenda SettingAlong with influencing behaviors, the progressive faction has been able to influenceagendas (Marotta 1981; D’Emilio 1983; Faderman 2015; Schulman 2019). One of the firstinstances of the progressive faction influencing an agenda happened in regards to research. Bycreating the Gender Identity Clinic and the Harry Benjamin Foundation (now the WorldProfessional Association for Transgender Health) the Erickson Educational Foundation createdmore agenda items for research surrounding the reification and manifestation of gender (Nownes2019, 27). Additionally, EEF created ways for people to access transgender specific healthcare,which put accessing that care on people’s agendas (Nownes 2019, 18). In the Gay Liberation EraLavender Menace forced NOW to expand their scope of who they included in their activism,which inherently changed that organization’s agenda (Marotta 1981, 244).AIDS activism shows much of this faction’s ability to influence agendas. The Gay Men’sHealth Crisis provided many services to people with AIDS and the gay community that severalpeople provided and joined, which put items on people’s agendas because there was finally aconcerted effort to combat the AIDS crisis and help people who had the disease have somecomfort in their final days (Faderman 2015, 419). GMHC created a hotline for people to call,120made it easier to access a community of people, and was able to recruit lawyers to help thosewith AIDS fight evictions or set up their estate (ibid). By creating resources for people withAIDS, GMHC put providing, accessing, and utilizing those services on the agendas of people inthe community.ACT UP had a wider range of influence over agenda setting during the AIDS crisis. ACTUP did put providing and accessing services on people’s agendas, but they also influenced theagenda of AIDS research and treatment as well as the agenda of research into diseases. Just likethe GMHC before, ACT UP provided community services to those with AIDS, which putproviding and accessing those services on people’s agenda (Schulman 2019, 9). However, ACTUP was able to expand the scope of their agenda setting power to influence agendas ofgovernment organizations and publications, which is seen in the organization’s demonstrationsoutside of the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes ofHealth as well as the Women’s Caucus’ protests of Cosmopolitan. Through protests anddemonstrations ACT UP was able to put research into AIDS, finding treatments for AIDS, andmoving towards a multi-drug treatment strategy on the agenda of the FDA and the NIH. TheWomen’s Caucus in ACT UP was focused on removing medical disinformation from the mediaand research into how AIDS affects women (Schulman 2019, 385-87; Brier 2009, 173).Protesting Cosmo and the head of the CDC’s HIV Surveillance Project achieved both of theaforementioned goals and put publishing accurate medical information on the agenda of mediaoutlets and research into women and AIDS on the agenda of the CDC (ibid).Power over agenda setting in the Contemporary Era comes from organizations likeSONG because it works to expand the scope of what other organizations and movements aredoing (“Our Mission, Vision & History” 2022). By making other organizations and movements121aware of how they can integrate working against anti-LGBTQ+ phenomena and ideologies intheir work, items are being placed on others’ agendas.Power Over IdeologyUnlike its liberal counterpart, the progressive faction is able to consistently influencepublic ideology, which shows power in the third dimension (Lukes 2021, 33). The reason thatprogressive faction is able to work in the third dimension more consistently than its liberalcounterpart comes from the creation of alternative institutions that are run by members of thecommunity that prioritize the needs of the LGBTQ+ community over the comfort ofheterosexual society. The earliest example of this in the progressive faction is ONE. Throughcriticizing the liberal turn of Mattachine and publishing progressive ideas about the direction theGay Movement needed to take, ONE was able to help keep the spark of progressive action aliveduring the early days of the movement (D’Emilio 1983, 87). Even though ONE was focused onideological influence in the community, their actions are still situated in the third dimensionbecause they were working to combat the ideological shift that was able to facilitate a return tomilitant strategies in Mattachine (D’Emilio 1983, 151). The Erickson Educational Foundationalso exercised third dimensional power via the alternative institutions it created. Through thecreation of the Gender Identity Clinic and the Harry Benjamin Foundation, EEF was able to helpchange people’s conception of gender to create a more tolerant society for trans individuals(Nownes 2019, 18).Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries continued the work of making a more tolerantsociety to members of the LGBTQ+ community. STAR was one of the earliest consistentproducers of queer theory to challenge the notion of cisgender/heterosexualnormativity as idealtenants in society (Cohen 2009, 95-103). STAR also combated the idea that trans people,122especially trans people of color, are objectionable members of society via providing housing to“street people” and distributing literature about transgenderism to cisgender society (Cohen2009, 92-93). Again, even though STAR worked internally instead of externally, this is stillpower over ideology. The aim of STAR’s actions was to change the transphobic ideology thathad imbued itself in the Gay Movement (Daum 2020, 5). Lavender Menace was also able toinfluence ideology, though they focused on changing the ideology surrounding lesbianism in theWomen's Movement; LM was able to change the Women's Movement ideology by distributingliterature and sharing their lived experiences at the second congress to unite women in 1970(Faderman 2015, 236-43). This change in ideology facilitated an expansion of the scope of socialactivism taken on by the Women's Movement (ibid). There is also a potential that TAO was ableto influence ideology, but not much is known about the impact of its actions (Nownes 2019, 21;Meyerowitz 2004, 240-41).As with the other dimensions of power, the progressive faction’s work in the thirddimension can be elucidated during the AIDS crisis. The actions of ACT UP against the FDA,NIH, CDC, the Catholic Church, etc. are just one aspect of the organization’s ability to workwithin the third dimension of power, specifically through the use of die-ins (Aizenman 2019).The die-ins took place mainly at churches and government institutions responsible for addressingAIDS. It happened at the former because of clergy’s opposition to the use of condoms, whichhelped AIDS spread like a wildfire, and it happened at the latter because of their decision toignore the epidemic and gay advocacy (ibid). This tactic brought the institutions and people faceto face with the very consequences of their actions. While people only feigned death at die-ins, itstill sent the very real message of the severity of the disease and it helped humanize the groupmost likely to be infected because they showed society what it is like to live with AIDS (ibid).123Other forms of protest and demonstrations also allowed the organization to influencepeople’s ideology. ACT UP getting society and the government to recognize the impact AIDShad on gay people and the consequences of the paralysis around society’s response helpedfacilitate a change in the way people thought about the disease. The demonstrations outside ofthe FDA and NIH worked within the third dimension because they helped reconceptualize AIDSand gay people as worthy of attention (Schulman 2019, 9). Media created by ACT UP also workswithin third dimensional power. Through powerful messages like “Silence=Death” and posters ofPresident Reagan with the phrase “AIDSGATE” on them, ACT UP was able to get people torealize how big of a deal the AIDS crisis was and the effect that it caused within the communityespecially by equating the government paralysis around the response to AIDS with the mostprominent government scandal to date (Ghaziani 2008, 82). Most importantly though, the mediacreated by ACT UP showed the humanity, the anger, the fear, and the love of the LGBTQ+community (Gould 2009).ACT UP getting the insurance exclusion for people with AIDS removed, the Women’sCaucus fighting with the Centers for Disease Control because of the inherent exclusion ofwomen from what was considered AIDS, their fight with the Catholic Church, and so much moreof ACT UP’s actions all had one of the same consequences: destigmatization of gay identitiesthrough mitigating the shame tied to homosexuality. The actions taken by ACT UP show peoplemobilizing around a stigmatized identity and publicly fighting for their lives because societyrefused to (Gould 2009, 55). ACT UP fundamentally changed the way government run healthagencies, society, and even the community itself saw LGBTQ+ identities (Gould 2009, 5). TheAIDS Coalition to Unleash Power fought against homophobia as well as flawed socialconceptions of homosexuality and emerged semi-victorious.124The progressive organizations in the Contemporary Era have continued the legacy ofcombating homophobia. The Sylvia Rivera Law Project and FORGE are both fighting againsthomophobia and transphobia with relative success. The SRLP works in the third dimension byproviding legal assistance to people of color and low-income individuals who experiencediscrimination based on gender or gender expression, provides trainings, public education, andutilizes policy reform to change a society built around excluding them (“Our Approach andPrinciples/Nuestras Práctica y Principios”, n.d.). Through the legal assistance provided by theSylvia Rivera Law Project, the way the court system analyzes transgender issues has gonethrough a metamorphosis because of their inclusion in the institution, which helps changetransphobic ideology that has woven itself into the court system (Benjamin 2013, 109-10). Thetrainings and education provided by SRLP is able to combat homophobic and transphobicideologies that exist in those who provide social services (Hatch et al. 2016, 7-9).FORGE does much of the same non-legal work as the SRLP does with the addition ofcreating support resources for LGBTQ+ youth. Trainings provided by FORGE help combat thetransphobic ideology used by those who provide services to providers of anti-violence services(Pyne 2011). The epitome of progressive organizing in the Contemporary Era works within thethird dimension of power and changes the way that society, people, and businesses see membersof the LGBTQ+ community. The result of influencing people’s ideology as the SRLP andFORGE do means that they also influence people’s observable behavior. Through the educationand trainings provided by both organizations, people are able to combat internalizedhomophobia, transphobia, and correct their biases of both people of color and low-incomeindividuals, which translates to people behaving in ways they would not had they not receivedthe trainings or education (Hatch et al. 2016, 7-9).125SONG is able to influence ideology as well. Through focusing on how oppression on thebasis of race, class, and gender are interconnected, SONG can fundamentally influence andchange the ideology of other movements and organizations because they have that additionalepistemic frame to view the world (“Our Mission, Vision & History” 2022). SONG providesideological supplements to other organizations and movements to show how interconnectedoppression is and how to effectively mitigate it.ConclusionBoth the liberal and progressive factions of the LGBTQ+ Movement have the ability toconsistently influence people’s observable behavior and others’ agendas which means they bothregularly work within the first and second dimensions of power (Lukes 2021, 21 and 25).However, the ability of the liberal faction to influence ideology has different consequences whencompared to its progressive counterpart. While the liberal faction has been able to positivelyinfluence others’ ideology, there is no longevity to that influence, meaning the liberal faction hasa weakened ability to work in the third dimension of power (Lukes 2021, 33). On the other hand,the progressive faction works consistently and positively in the third dimension of powerbecause they are able to weaken systemic and local homophobia and transphobia both internaland external to the movement (ibid). One of the main causes of this discrepancy is the exclusionand institutional reliance that has been seen to permeate the liberal faction’s activism. Thecreation of normativities that is seemingly ubiquitous in the liberal faction has served as anexcluding force that gives greater society an expectation to hold the actions of members of theLGBTQ+ community to and when those expectations are not met, society expects the individualto change to fit in instead of changing itself to make room for the individual (Vaid 1995, 4-6).The liberal reliance on institutions also prevents it from influencing ideology because one cannot126influence systems to change themselves, especially when it means weakening its power (Vaid1995, 106).This analysis of power not only revealed a discrepancy in the capacity for power in theliberal and progressive factions of the LGBTQ+ movement, it also describes the kinds ofchanges the factions can make. Because the liberal faction can consistently work in the first andsecond dimension of power, it can only address individual issues as they show up instead ofproactively working to prevent inequality and inequity in society. Additionally, the negativeinfluences over ideology the liberal faction has demonstrated created an environment ofsimultaneous freedom and oppression. Since the progressive faction can work positively withinall three dimensions of power, it is able to address issues as they appear and work proactively tostop inequality and inequity because it weakens the ideological forces like homophobia andtransphobia that lead to inequality and inequity.The above analysis of power in the liberal and progressive factions may lead some tothink that one faction is more powerful than the other overall or in regards to one specificdimension; however, that is not an accurate way of looking at the power held by what has grownto be the LGBTQ+ Movement. The two factions’ capacities of power are complimentary. Theliberal faction is focused more on immediate change through influencing those currently inpower, whereas the progressive faction is focusing its efforts on long term change by influencingfuture policy makers. These different foci working in tandem help usher in continuous,sustainable change and does not mean that one is more powerful or better than the other.127Chapter Five- Justice in the LGBTQ+ MovementThe framework of power, justice, and knowledge introduced in chapter one is a usefulway to examine the effective change brought by the actions of the liberal and progressivefactions of what has come to be known as the LGBTQ+ Movement. This chapter will provide areview of Rawls’ (1958; 1971; 2001) conception of justice as fairness and Fraser (1997) andHonneth’s (2004) formulation of justice as recognition and redistribution. As mentioned inchapter one, the lens of justice allows for an evaluation of how effective the change brought bysocial movements is because social movements mobilize to make life more just for marginalizedpeople, i.e., social movements are in the pursuit of justice (Thompson 2002, 721). By lookingthrough a lens of justice, one can see how effective the change social movements have brought isat providing justice for their constituency. The analysis of justice in the liberal and progressivefactions of what has come to be known as the LGBTQ+ Movement will show that, similar to thereification of power, the liberal faction’s capacity to provide justice is not as strong as itsprogressive counterpart’s. The liberal faction has a limited ability to provide universal justice forthe LGBTQ+ community under either formulation of the concept; however, the progressivefaction has established a better ability to provide universal justice for their community throughboth fairness and recognition and redistribution.Justice RevisitedJustice as fairness aims to create a society where everyone has just as much access tosociety by increasing the fairness of the practices of political and social institutions (Rawls 1958,164-65). The criteria for measuring the fairness of said institutions are known as the Principles ofJustice of which there are two: 1) everyone has the same indefeasible claim to fully adequate128equal and basic liberties and 2) social and economic inequalities need to be: a) attached to officesand positions open to everyone and b) to the greatest benefit of society’s disadvantaged members(Rawls 2001, 42). To Rawls (1958; 1971; 2001) justice is achieved by giving everyone the samescheme of basic rights and liberties, the ability to hold office and influence election outcomes,and have any social and economic inequality be to the benefit of the least advantaged, which willcreate faire practices in political and social institutions. Justice as recognition and redistributionconceptualized by Fraser (1997) and Honneth (2004) is focused less on symptoms of inequality,e.g., gay people not being eligible for employment with the Civil Service Commission, and moreon its causes, e.g., homophobia. The crux of justice as recognition and redistribution iscombating phenomena that create injustices in the first place (Fraser 1997, 11; Honneth 2004,352). Recognition is a requisite to provide a redistribution of rights, benefits, and privilegesprovided to people in society (Fraser 1997; Honneth 2004).Justice and the Liberal FactionThe liberal faction is only able to provide limited justice, either as fairness or recognitionand redistribution, to the LGBTQ+ community because of the exclusion that defines it. Theliberal faction for the most part is only able to provide justice to the privileged members of theircommunity because it is the most privileged members of the LGBTQ+ community that are ableto have a claim to the same indefeasible rights and liberties to those granted outside of thecommunity due to intersectionality being ignored (Runyan 2018). Additionally, social andeconomic inequalities that remain in place after policy change advocated by the liberal factionare not being made to be to the benefit of the most disadvantaged, in fact any eradication ofsocial and economic inequalities fought for by the liberal faction are done so at the expense ofthe least advantaged. Furthermore, there was a time when the liberal faction had the capacity to129provide justice as recognition and redistribution, but ever since the AIDS crisis, liberal activism’sability to provide justice as recognition and redistribution. .Justice as FairnessSince its creation in 1958, Rawls’ (1958; 1971; 2001) conception of justice has alwaysbeen institutionally based, “Justice as a virtue of particular actions or of persons I do not take upat all” (Rawls 1958, 164-65). Rawls (1958; 1971; 2001) focuses his conception of justice onpolitical and legal systems. Just as the liberal faction focuses on working within political andsocial institutions, so does Rawls (1958; 1971; 2001). The liberal faction’s activism has beenalmost all done within political or social institutions, so much so that working within institutionsis a defining feature of the faction. The first major public political action of the liberal factionwas the Dale Jennings trial in 1952 and it was entirely focused on making fairer criminal justiceand legal systems for homosexuals (D’Emilio 1983, 70). The liberal faction’s activism aimed atchanging institutional practices is something that has continued well into the Contemporary Era(Faderman 2015; Wolfson n.d.a; Daum 2020). The liberal faction adopted justice as fairness’(Rawls 1958; 1971; 2001) framework to achieve justice for the LGBTQ+ community, which isexemplified by its reliance on political and social institutions.Along with the commonality of working through political and social institutions, theliberal faction’s political activism roughly aligns with the First Principle of justice as fairness(Rawls 1958; 1971; 2001). The first principle is, “Each person has the same indefeasible claim toa fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the samescheme of liberties for all” (Rawls 2001, 70-71). Here is where the justice provided by the liberalfaction potentially strays a little bit from the provided framework. The exclusion that helpsdefine liberal organizations arguably prevents their activism from aligning with the first principle130of justice because it categorically prevents some people from having access to the indefeasibleclaim that liberal activism provides other people; however, the liberal faction is working onmaking sure that people cannot be excluded on account of their sexuality or, just recently, statusas transgender (Faderman 2015; Daum 2020). While the liberal faction’s activism does notencompass everyone, it is doing its part to make sure that, “Each person has the sameindefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties, which scheme iscompatible with the same scheme of liberties for all,” (Rawls 2001, 42; Faderman 2015). Afterall, it is the LGBTQ+ Movement and its activism centers around LGBTQ+ specific issues so thatthe community can have access to the same rights and liberties as those who are not in thecommunity.Rawls’ (1958; 1971; 2001) Second Principle, which concerns the distribution of socialand economic inequalities, as mentioned above, has two parts. The first part is “[social andeconomic inequalities] are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions offair equality and opportunity” (Rawls 2001, 42). The liberal faction, once again by workingthrough institutions, has created and mobilized a lavender vote that helps create equality ofopportunity amongst the LGBTQ+ community to have their voices heard in all levels ofgovernment (Faderman 2015, 266-278). Additionally, the Victory Fund was created specificallyto help people in the LGBTQ+ community get elected to public office (“Our History – LGBTQVictory Fund”, n.d.). The liberal faction has done a good job providing a, “fair equality ofopportunity” in elections and access to elected offices amongst the LGBTQ+ community (Rawls2001, 42). However, the second part of the second principle is where the liberal faction divergesfrom the framework. Due to the liberal faction excluding and dropping protections for theleast-advantaged members of the LGBTQ+ community, which was seen in Mattachine’s131activism, activism surrounding trans rights, and as recently as the decision in Bostock, the liberalfaction’s ability to make social and economic inequalities be to the benefit of the leastadvantaged members of the community is non-existent (D’Emilio 1983, 92-93; Daum 2020;Marcus 2020). The liberal faction’s penchant for exclusion is to the detriment, not benefit, of theleast advantaged members of the LGBTQ+ community.The answer to the question “does the liberal faction provide justice as fairness to theLGBTQ+ community?” is complicated. The liberal faction, just like justice as fairness (Rawls1958; 1971; 2001), is focused on working through institutions to make their practices fairer bycreating a more even distribution of benefits and burdens (Faderman 2015). Additionally, theliberal faction is working to ensure that, “Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fullyadequate scheme of equal basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme ofliberties for all,” by adding sexuality and, just recently, status as transgender to civil rights laws(ibid; Rawls 2001, 42). Through creating a consciousness of a lavender vote and organizing toget members of the LGBTQ+ community elected to public office the liberal faction has openedup and strengthened the ability for members of the LGBTQ+ community to hold public officeand affect the outcome of elections (Faderman 2015). Where the activism of the liberal factiondiverges from Rawls’ (1958; 1971; 2001) conception of justice is the second part of the SecondPrinciple because of the liberal faction’s defining feature of exclusion. The exclusion taken on bythe liberal faction prevents them from working to make social and economic inequalities benefitthe least advantaged members of the LGBTQ+ community. The liberal faction of the LGBTQ+Movement does provide justice as fairness to its community, but in a semi-limited capacitybecause of its penchant for exclusion prevents it from satisfying the second part of the SecondPrinciple.132Justice as Recognition and RedistributionJustice as recognition and redistribution developed by Fraser (1997) and Honneth (2004)is also present in the liberal faction, though to a limited extent. With the exception of the readinggroups sponsored by Mattachine, the series of zaps on the American Psychological Associationto recognize homosexuality as a valid expression of human sexuality, and the inclusion of awoman on Jack Paar Tonite, the justice provided to the LGBTQ+ community by the liberalfaction of the movement is limited and existential. Just like justice as fairness, those who theliberal faction provided justice for tend to be cisgender, white, homosexual, and male. Onceagain, this is the direct result of exclusion within the liberal faction.The liberal faction was more apt at allowing injustice to flourish in the movement in theframework provided by Fraser (1997) and Honneth (2004). The exclusion of women in the firsttwo eras of the movement by and large prevented Mattachine, the Gay Liberation Front, and theGay Activists Alliance from providing justice as fairness to the entire gay community. By notrecognizing the unique issues that faced women, like a lack of economic freedom, severalorganizations in the liberal faction in the first two eras of the Gay Movement were unable toprovide justice as recognition and redistribution to lesbians. Neither the organizations nor societycould recognize the unique issues faced by homosexual women, which prevented a universalredistribution of rights, benefits, and privileges that were provided during those eras because theeconomic and social domination of women was not addressed or even recognized, whichprevented justice as fairness from being achieved universally (D’Emilio 1983, 92; Kissack 1995,110-12; Fraser 1997, 13).Non-recognition continued into the AIDS era. Because the liberal faction framed AIDSas a human problem instead of a gay problem that implied being gay and being human were133mutually exclusive helped prevent gay people from being seen as people during the AIDS crisis,which only served to further oppression (Vaid 1995, 75). The Contemporary Era still facilitatesnon-recognition. The Human Rights Campaign was perfectly fine with the government notrecognizing transgender issues and the HRC and Freedom to Marry helped keep non-recognitionof untraditional families alive, which also facilitates misrecognition of these family structuresbecause they are misrecognized as not a family (Schindler 2007; Wolfson n.d.a; Kacere 2015).Furthermore, the liberal faction is awash with misrecognition that helped strengthen thedomination of people in the LGBTQ+ community. Misrecognition starts with the Daughters ofBilitis as they refused to accurately recognize butch women, women with blue collar jobs, andwomen who participated in the bar scene as valid lesbians by seeing them as “[women] who hadbeen living pretty much as a transvestite most of her life” (D’Emilio 1983, 106). Theconsequence of this misrecognition only served to further the misogyny that continues to oppresswomen to this day because of the maintenance of gender normativity. Misrecognition continuesto this day as a result of liberal activism by creating legal frameworks where bisexual individualsare recognized as gay or straight depending on the gender of their partner. By being complicit inthe non/mis-recognition, the liberal faction is helping maintain the cause(s) of domination(homophobia, transphobia, etc.) that lead to the oppression of the LGBTQ+ community.None of this is to say that justice as recognition and redistribution was not present inthese organizations. The reading groups sponsored by Mattachine were able to provide thehomosexual community with the tools to recognize that they are a community (Marotta1981,71). That is justice because there was a fundamental shift in the way people recognizedthemselves (ibid). The zaps carried out against the American Psychological Association wereable to provide justice to the gay community because homosexuality was recognized as a valid134expression of human sexuality instead of as a pathology and indicator of a moral deficiency bythe APA and greater society (Turner 2017). The Gay Activists Alliance fighting for the inclusionof a lesbian to go on Jack Paar Tonite was able to get society to recognize that lesbians arefacing a unique set of issues that cannot be brushed off (Marotta 1983, 286; Capsuto 2020).These actions were able to provide justice as recognition because the domination causing theaforementioned oppression was recognized and resources were redistributed to weaken the causeof the domination (Fraser 1997, 11).At one time the liberal faction was able to provide justice as fairness. By Mattachinegetting the homosexual community to recognize that they are a community, the GAA getting theAPA and greater society to recognize homosexuality as a valid expression of human sexuality,and the GAA getting society to recognize the unique set of issues faced by lesbians that cannotbe brushed off, the liberal faction was able to provide justice as recognition and redistributionbecause they were able to weaken the homophobia and misogyny that kept them oppressed.Unfortunately, that time came to a close in the mid-1980s (Vaid 1995, 75). Via its response toAIDS and activism in the Contemporary Era, the liberal faction seems to have lost the ability toprovide justice as recognition and redistribution to the LGBTQ+ community because itperpetuates and is complicit in non/mis-recognition. The liberal faction has started to activelywork against creating a just society as defined by Fraser (1997) and Honneth (2004) because oftheir acceptance and perpetuation of non/mis-recognition. However, some recent activismsuggests there is a liberal revival of providing justice as recognition and redistribution.Justice and the Progressive FactionThe progressive faction’s strategies allow for a universal extension of justice to theLGBTQ+ community. When it comes to justice as fairness the progressive faction’s activism135satisfies the First and Second Principles of Justice that allow for fairer practices of political andsocial institutions. However, there is a fundamental tenent in Rawls’ (1958; 1971; 2001) theorythat what is just for one person is just for the next, but that is not true because people’s identitiesput them on different proverbial playing fields that require different criteria to be met for justiceto exist (Crenshaw 1989). The progressive faction is able to provide justice as recognition andredistribution as defined by Fraser (1997) and Honneth (2004) because they are able to getsociety and other parts of the movement to recognize the oppression and domination experiencedby the LGBTQ+ community that allows for the weakening of a social, institutional, or culturalfailing that made the oppression and domination possible.Justice as FairnessThe progressive faction’s activism is able to satisfy the two Principles of Justice put forthby Rawls (1958; 1971; 2001). Lavender Menace is a wonderful example of the progressivefaction providing an indefeasible claim to the same equal and basic liberties as everyone else. Inthe 1970s, lesbians had been excluded from both the Gay and Women’s Movements (Faderman2015, 233-247). To rectify this exclusion Lavender Menace worked within the Women’sMovement to get them to pay attention to lesbian problems and they were successful. Due to thework of LM lesbians had access to the equal and basic right of redress that had been enjoyed byheterosexual women and gay men (Marotta 1981, 244).The progressive faction has mostly stayed out of electoral politics and activism, so theyhave not actively fought for LGBTQ+ people to have the ability to run for office or haveinfluence over election outcomes. The progressive faction’s activism does make social andeconomic inequalities work to the benefit of the least advantaged members of the community.For example, STAR’s activism focused unequally on trans women of color, but it was the trans136women of color who were, and continue to be, the least advantaged members of the LGBTQ+community. Additionally, the progressive response to AIDS focused on those with the disease asopposed to those who had not gotten it. While there is some inequality in the activism of theprogressive faction it is done to benefit the least privileged members of the community.While the progressive faction is able to satisfy the Principles of Justice, it hasfundamental disagreements with the way justice is brought about and having a list of criteria thatwould provide justice to everyone. The progressive faction does not believe that justice comesfrom political or social institutions because that is the most basic cause of continued oppressionfor the LGBTQ+ community (Cohen 2013, 80). The progressive faction, unlike Rawls (1958;1971; 2001) does not operate from a top-down approach to social change (ibid). Additionally, theprogressive faction fundamentally disagrees with there being one set of criteria that can provideuniversal justice because it knows that there is a difference in the needs of a white, cisgender,gay, man and a Black, transgender, bisexual, woman and justice for the former does not equaljustice for the latter (Cohen 2013). Justice as fairness attempts to create normativity and theprogressive faction is staunchly against any kind of normativity (Rawls 2001, 14-15; Cohen2013).When it comes to justice as fairness, the progressive faction is situated interestingly. Itworks to provide those in the community with an indefeasible claim to basic rights and libertiesenjoyed by those outside of the community and works to make sure that any inequality in themovement affects the most privileged members; however, it rejects the fundamental idea thatjustice can be achieved through political and social institutions because they have helped codifyhomophobia, transphobia, misogyny, etc. into society (Cohen 2013). The progressive faction alsodisagrees with there being a list of criteria that can ensure justice for everyone because it137recognizes how different identities, either working alone or in tandem, affect the way peopleinteract with the world and builds subjectivity into its work. The answer to “does the progressivefaction provide justice as fairness to the LGBTQ+ community?”, the answer is not so simple.While its activism does align with the two Principles of Justices, it rejects the central idea ofjustice being achieved from the top down and the objective criteria to provide justice. Theanswer to the aforementioned question is yes; the progressive faction can provide justice asfairness to the LGBTQ+ community, but not in the way Rawls (1958, 1971, 2001) had in mind.Justice as Recognition and RedistributionThe progressive faction is able to consistently provide justice as recognition andredistribution to the LGBTQ+ community because of its conscious practice of inclusion. Withthe inclusion practiced by the progressive faction comes an inherent understanding andacknowledgement of any lacunae that currently exist. Along with the progressive organizationsrecognizing exclusion and its harms, they worked internally and externally to get both themovement and society to accurately recognize what homosexuality is and what being trans is.Internally, both ONE and Lavender Menace tried to get, respectively, the Gay Movementand the Women’s Movement to recognize lacunae in their activism. ONE worked to showMattachine and the DOB that they were not doing enough for homosexuals because of theirexclusion and wont to turn to non-homosexual professionals as experts (D’Emilio 1983, 81).ONE was arguably successful at getting Mattachine to recognize their activism was doing muchof anything by helping influence Frank Kameny to join the movement, which facilitated a shift inMattachine’s activism that was more hands on than anything done post-1952 (D’Emilio 1983,149). Furthermore, Lavender Menace got the Women’s Movement to recognize the uniquesituatedness of lesbians because they are at the intersection of two marginalized communities138(Marotta 1983 244). Both ONE and Lavender Menace worked internally to get, respectively, theGay Movement and the Women’s Movement to recognize flaws in their activism, which allowedfor a redistribution of resources to address those flaws (D’Emilio 1983, 149; Faderman 2015,233).Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries also focused its energy more internally, but notin a way that was similar to the activism of ONE or LM. Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnsonrecognized that as long as the Gay and Women’s movement were run by cisgender people, theneeds of the transgender community would not be met, so they created STAR (Daum 2020, 5).STAR's goal was to focus on the, \"Practical needs of gay and transgender people\" (Nownes 2019,21). To achieve this, STAR sheltered those who would have otherwise been left on the streets,which provided “objectionable members” of society a way to escape a reliance on drugs and sexwork as well as receive gender affirmation (Cohen 2009, 90). STAR’s activism addressed issuesfacing transgender individuals, particularly trans women of color, who had been disregarded bythe Gay Movement and the Women’s Movement.Working externally to get society to recognize what homosexuality and transness is andthe issues facing people in those communities is something that the progressive faction has beendoing since the early days of the movement. The Erickson Educational Foundation was run by atrans man who recognized society’s gaps in providing support for the transgender communityand worked to get trans people the recognition they deserved. EEF founded organizations thatwould conduct and share research on what gender is as well as work to provide gender affirmingcare to transgender individuals (Nownes 2019, 27; Pettis 2015). EEF recognized the needs oftransgender people who had been excluded from the movement and society; EEF worked toprovide a redistribution of both the movement’s and society’s resources to meet those needs.139Working on getting greater society to recognize people for who they are and the issuesthey face has stayed with the progressive faction. The Transsexual/Transvestite ActionOrganization actively worked to rectify the injustice they had recognized and fought to includethe trans community in any redistribution of rights, benefits, and privileges that had been givento gay community (Meyerowitz 2004, 239). TAO also worked to get society to correctlyrecognize transgender individuals through their publications Mirage and Moonshadow (“AngelaLynn Douglas and Transsexual Action Organization | ONE Archives”, n.d.).Justice as recognition and redistribution was ubiquitous in AIDS activism. GMHC andACT UP recognized the harms of the paralysis surrounding the response to AIDS and they tookaction by providing resources for those who were affected by the disease (Shilts 1987; Schulman2019). During the height of the AIDS crisis, both the GMHC and ACT UP organized, protested,and fought to get society to recognize the impact that AIDS was having on society in an effort toredistribute resources to combat the pandemic (Shilts 1987; Schulman 2019). Additionally, ACTUP worked to get the FDA, NIH, and CDC to recognize how their bureaucratic structure waskilling people and there needed to be a restructuring of the process to save lives (Schulman 2019,9). Furthermore, media created by ACT UP along with their novel demonstrations and protestshelped society recognize gay people as human instead of as people who were morally flawed andworking to end western culture (Aizenman 2019). All of the work surrounding AIDS activism bythe Gay Men’s Health Crisis and the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power was about recognizingthe short comings of society and trying to get society to do the same.Progressive organizing and action in the Contemporary Era has provided justice asrecognition and redistribution through providing legal aid, education, and training. Dean Spaderecognized that low income trans people and trans people of color were essentially barred from140society because they had very little access to redress in systems that were created without roomfor them (Benjamin 2013, 107). Beyond assisting low income trans people and trans people ofcolor, SRLP hosts educational and training sessions for service providers so they can recognizethe unique needs of the transgender community and provide them adequate support andresources (“Trainings and Speaking Engagements | SRLP”, n.d.). The goal of FORGE’s work isthe same as the educational and training sessions of SRLP: it wants to get society to recognizetrans people for who they are, the barriers that exist in living as trans (“Trainings – FORGE,”n.d.). Additionally, SONG and Familia have recognized the need for a transition to a purposefulintegration of intersectionality in social movements that allows oppression to be holisticallyweakened as a result of that incorporation (“Our Mission, Vision & History” 2022; “Programs -Familia: TQLM”, n.d.).The progressive faction’s strategies have helped provide justice as recognition andredistribution to the community because it works to recognize lacunae in current activism and toget society to recognize what it is like to be LGBTQ+ with or without being at an intersection ofother marginalized identities. Recognition of failings of current activism creates a pathway torectify those failings, which is mostly done by including people who have been excluded.Externally, the progressive faction wants society to recognize members of the community forwho they are. The progressive faction has been working for decades to get transgender peoplerecognized for who they are and not someone crossdressing and playing pretend as well asgetting society to recognize LGB+ identities as valid expressions of sexuality. The work of theprogressive faction has revolved around recognizing the failings of the movement, working torectify those failings, and getting society to recognize what gayness, transness, etc. is as well aswhat it means to sit at the intersection of one of those identities and another marginalized one.141ConclusionThe liberal faction’s ability to provide justice as fairness (Rawls 1958, 1971, 2001) islimited because of the second condition of the Second Principle of Justice. When the liberalfaction excludes people from either the movement or drops protections for specific members ofthe community, it is actively perpetuating social inequality that is to the detriment, not benefit, ofthe least advantaged members of the community (Faderman 2015; Colbert 2014). The liberalfaction is able to provide justice as fairness to the LGBTQ+ community, just in a limited fashionbecause of its penchant for exclusion. Additionally, the time of the liberal faction being able toprovide justice as recognition and redistribution (Fraser 1997; Honneth 2004) has, for the mostpart, passed. When the NGLTF created a strategy to address the AIDS crisis, they did so byallowing the government and society to not recognize the impact the virus had on the gaycommunity, and the liberal faction was not working to regain its ability to provide that type ofjustice (Vaid 1995, 75). However, some recent activism suggests it is working on rectifying that.The progressive faction, however, has a stronger capacity for justice. When it comes tojustice as fairness, the progressive faction does a good job at providing justice despite itsfundamental disagreements with justice being achieved in a top-down fashion and the idea thatthere can be a list of criteria that will universally provide justice. Just about the only reason theprogressive faction’s activism might diverge from justice as fairness is because it does not focusits attention on electoral politics, which is the first condition of the Second Principle of Justice(Rawls 2001, 42). Furthermore, the progressive faction has been working internally andexternally to get the movement and greater society to recognize people for who they really are aswell as the unique issues facing intersectionaly identified people (Cohen 2013). Progressiveactivism today has continued to fight for accurate recognition of transgender people, people of142color, and others who have been excluded from the liberal faction (Benjamin 2013; McMichael2014; “Familia:TQLM | Homepage”, n.d.; “Our Mission, Vision & History” 2022). In regards tojustice, the progressive faction’s capacity to provide justice to the LGBTQ+ community isstronger and better established than the liberal faction’s.It is difficult not to pass moral judgment on the liberal faction because of the limitation ofa capacity for justice that stems from its penchant for exclusion. However, there is, once again,an interplay between the types of justice granted by the two factions. The work of the liberal andprogressive factions in the framework provided by Rawls (1958; 1971; 2001) gives people dejure access to resources and institutions because of formal policy barriers being taken down. Thework of the Movement, mainly from the progressive faction, in the framework provided byFraser (1997) and Honneth (2004) is able to give people de facto access because the informalbarriers that had been created are being taken down. Both factions work together to providejustice for members of the LGBTQ+ community; their work is complementary because together,they maximally increase the standing of the LGBTQ+ community in society.143Chapter Six- Knowledge in the LGBTQ+ MovementThe framework of power, justice, and knowledge introduced in chapter one is a usefulway to examine the effective change brought by the actions of the liberal and progressivefactions of what has come to be known as the LGBTQ+ Movement. This chapter will provide areview of epistemic justice provided by Fricker (2007) and willful hermeneutical ignorancepostulated by Pohlhaus (2012). As mentioned in chapter one, looking through a lens ofknowledge, one can see what has fallen through the proverbial cracks in social movements’actions and what still remains to be done because without that mechanism of reflection, a fullschematic of justice cannot be provided to social movements’ constituencies (Fricker 2006). Theanalysis of knowledge in the liberal and progressive factions of what has come to be known asthe LGBTQ+ Movement will show that, similar to power and justice, the liberal faction’scapacity to allow for the proliferation is more problematic compared to the progressive faction’sbecause it allows for the maintenance of oppression. The liberal faction has actively silencedintersectionaly identified people, helped stifle the proliferation of vocabulary that would aid inpeople’s ability to understand their experiences and identities, and has helped society maintainflawed epistemic framework they view the LGBTQ+ community through; however, theprogressive faction has not silenced people, created their own media to provide people with waysto describe their experiences and identity, and actively given society, and the liberal faction,better epistemic frameworks to view the LGBTQ+ community.Knowledge RevisitedEpistemic justice provided by Fricker (2007) has two distinct parts to it: 1) testimonialinjustice and 2) hermeneutic injustice. Testimonial injustice occurs when, “prejudice causes a144hearer to give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker’s word” (Fricker 2007, 1). It relies onprejudice and this injustice can either be local or systemic (Fricker 2007, 27). At the core oftestimonial injustice is someone being wronged in their capacity as a knower because theirtestimony does not carry the weight it ought to (Fricker 2007, 20). Unfortunately, testimonialinjustice prevents knowledge from being transmitted because the speaker is deemed unworthy asa knower. Hermeneutic injustice is a, “gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone at anunfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of their social experiences” (Fricker 2007,1). This type of injustice can only affect marginalized people because, “The powerless are morelikely to find themselves having some kind of social experience through a glass darkly, with atbest ill-fitting meanings to draw on in the effort to render them intelligible” (Fricker, 2007, 148).This type of injustice cuts both ways. The marginalized are affected because they cannot makesense of their own experiences and identity and society is similarly affected because it alsocannot understand that person’s experience or identity; however, the individual, not society, bearsthe brunt of the injustice because they cannot understand themselves nor how they fit into society(ibid).Willful hermeneutical ignorance created by Pohlhaus (2013) further developed theconcept of epistemic injustice. This kind of injustice occurs when those who are dominantlysituated cannot make sense of the lived experiences or social interactions of marginally situatedpeople. Unlike epistemic injustice, willful hermeneutical ignorance only affects marginallysituated people and is always systemic, “dominantly situated knowers… misunderstand andmisinterpret the world” (Pohlhaus 2012, 716). This type of injustice is best exemplified bypeople ignoring phenomena like cisgender-heterosexual normativity or white privilege becausethe dominantly situated see the benefits of these phenomena and cannot understand how145something that benefits them harms others. The crux of willful hermeneutic injustice isdominantly situated individuals using and maintaining faulty epistemic frameworks they viewthe world through.Knowledge and the Liberal FactionEpistemic injustice and willful hermeneutical ignorance show how the liberal faction ofthe Movement prevents the creation and dissemination of accurate knowledge. This is done intwo different ways: 1) the liberal faction can prevent knowledge that runs counter to the statusquo from forming and 2) it will try to prevent an accurate account of knowledge that is createdfrom being accessible to greater society if that knowledge weakens the status quo. Accurateknowledge is suppressed by the liberal faction because of its reliance on political andprofessional institutions as well as its penchant for exclusion.Epistemic InjusticeTestimonial injustice and hermeneutic injustice have run rampant in the liberal faction.Testimonial injustice tends to be suffered by those who are not cisgender, white, men in theLGBTQ+ community to such an extent that it is a staple of the liberal faction. Mattachine is theearliest perpetrator of this injustice as demonstrated by Del Martin at an annual conferencehosted by Mattachine and the DOB:At every one of these conventions I attend… I find I must defend the [DOB] as a separateand distinct women’s organization… [Mattachine has not] recognized the fact thatLesbians are women and that this 20th century is the era of emancipation of woman [sic](D'Emilio 1983, 105)After years of hearing about the plight of lesbians and working with the DOB, Mattachine didnot acknowledge lesbians’ testimony. Women as a whole were wronged in their capacity as146knowers because their testimony is not given the credence it deserves. This is not something thatis isolated to the Mattachine Society either. The Gay Liberation Front ignored women in theorganization when they informed the group that it was catering too heavily to the needs anddesires of gay men (Kissack 1995, 119). The environment these organizations created were notconducive to the dissemination of knowledge because of the exclusion that defines liberalorganizations.Hermeneutic injustice is more of a pervasive problem than testimonial injustice becauseof the liberal faction’s desire to both exclude and create homonormativity. In regards toexclusion, the liberal faction on many occasions has perpetuated hermeneutic injustice. Byquestioning the need for an organization focused on the issues faced by lesbians, the MattachineSociety showed that they were willing to allow society’s lacuna of knowledge around lesbianismto stay intact (D’Emilio 1984, 104). The exclusion of women, people of color, trans people, etc.,and those sitting at intersections of those identities from the GLF and the GAA meantmaintaining the lacuna of knowledge that made it difficult for intersectionality-identifiedmembers of the LGBTQ+ community make sense of their lived experiences because there wasno intersectional input in their activism. The same thing happened in the early days of AIDSactivism because the liberal faction was more than willing to de-center themselves from theresponse to AIDS, which made it difficult at best and impossible at worst for gay people withAIDS to make sense of their experiences (Vaid 1995, 75). This trend has continued into theContemporary Era by stifling the understanding of the complexity of human sexuality. With theexclusion of bisexuality from court decisions, it is difficult for people to know and understandthe full spectrum of sexual orientations because of their exclusion from protections granted to therest of their community.147The creation of homonormativity in the liberal faction has also made it difficult forpeople to understand their experiences. The Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitiscreated a homonormativity that made it difficult for people who further transgressed what societydeemed was acceptable (D’Emilio 1983, 109-113). The lack of inclusion of effeminate men,butch women, etc. in the discussions and editorials facilitated by Mattachine and the DOB,contributed to the lack of understanding that people who fell in those categories could have withtheir social experiences. Hermeneutic injustice was further developed by the liberal faction asthey developed homonormativity. When the GLF pushed for the contextualization ofhomosexuality through hypermasculinity it made it harder for people to understand their identitybecause of the opposing views given by society and other gay people. The Gay Liberation Frontand society worked parallel to each other and limited the understanding of homosexuality toeither be hypermasculine or feminine and every other contextualization was left behind. Theliberal faction in the Contemporary Era institutionalized a homonormative conceptualization ofLGBTQ+ identities, which makes it difficult for people who fall out of that conceptualization tounderstand themselves.Exclusion and homonormativity created by the liberal faction did not only harm people inthe community, it harmed society as a whole. Because lesbians, people of color, trans people, etc.and those who are intersectionaly identified could not understand their social experiences,society could not understand them either. The epistemic mechanisms for making sense of a butchlesbian’s identity or the experiences of a gay individual with AIDS simply did not exist in greatersociety and the liberal faction was not creating them. As a result, flawed policy wasimplemented, people died, and the harms that were faced by those in the community who werenot cis, white, gay, and male were ignored. Exclusionary tendencies and a desire to create and148enforce homonormativity prevented knowledge about the LGBTQ+ community from beingformed and/or transmitted to greater society.None of this is to say that the liberal faction is unable to foster environments that areconducive to the creation and dissemination of knowledge, but it is to say that the knowledgethat is created may not be the most accurate. The creation of trans- and homonormativity isknowledge about the community, but it is knowledge that is not accurate for everyone. Justbecause there are some same-sex couples that do get married and have kids or trans people whostart hormones and have gender confirming surgery, that does not mean everyone in thecommunity is going to follow in their footsteps. Even though the liberal faction can createknowledge and disseminate it, it does not mean that knowledge tells the whole story. Theexistence of epistemic injustice in liberal activism inherently decreases the ability of that factionto create and disseminate knowledge that can be used to analyze and understand the experienceof every member of the LGBTQ+ community.Willful Hermeneutical IgnoranceWillful hermeneutical ignorance in the liberal faction runs rampant. Thehomonormativity that the liberal faction is intent on creating has made flawed epistemicframeworks for society to view the community through. This is easily seen through thehomonormativity created by Mattachine and the DOB. When Mattachine tempered out and theystarted publishing articles about homosexuals being the same as heterosexuals in every aspectexcept sexual proclivities, the epistemic framework that was used to view homosexuals was notas accurate as it could have been because it could not make room for gay men that furthertransgressed gender norms nor could it make room for women homosexuals not needing thesame things as male homosexuals (Vaid 1995, 38). Willful hermeneutical ignorance also plagued149the DOB. By only viewing lesbians as those who conformed to feminine stereotypes, weremothers, and maybe had a non-blue-collar job, the DOB used a flawed epistemic framework fortheir activism because they could only recognize the issues that faced a small number of lesbians.Unfortunately, this has not changed. The GLF, the GAA, and the Radicalesbians used improperepistemic frameworks because they ignored and excluded people they believed wereobjectionable, which gave them a flawed view of who was in the community they were fightingfor and has helped keep oppressive structures, like transphobia, in place to this day.The National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce did not necessarily have a flawed epistemicframework of the gay community, but it did allow for flawed epistemic frameworks to be usedby heterosexual society during the AIDS crisis. By de-gaying AIDS, society thought that themost pressing issue of the time was the way AIDS deaths affected straight people (Vaid 1995,75). The liberal faction allowed an epistemic framework that privileged heterosexual feelingsover homosexual grief, sadness, fear, and death (Vaid 1995, 75). The existence of this epistemicframework necessarily limited greater society’s ability to understand the extent of the devastationcaused by the AIDS crisis because it was not only straight people and the dying who wereimpacted. Almost an entire generation of gay people died leaving their peers afraid of what wasgoing to happen to them, leaving their peers isolated and without community, and knowing thatsociety did not care about them, all of which could not be understood by heterosexual societybecause of the de-gayed framework they viewed AIDS through (Ghaziani 2008, 80-81).The Contemporary Era has also seen improper epistemic frameworks developed and beused because of actions taken by the liberal faction. The most pervasive and prevalent exampleof a flawed epistemic framework is found in regards to bisexuality. Because there is such alimited way of viewing and understanding sexuality, the potential for a misunderstanding what150non-extreme identities on the sexuality continuum are is high. One of the best examples ofsociety using a flawed epistemic framework as a result of the liberal faction’s activism comesfrom Netflix’s Big Mouth. The definition of pansexuality that the show uses when a pansexualcharacter is introduced is problematic to say the least:No, bisexuality is so binary. Being pansexual means my sexual preference isn't limited bygender identity… It's like, some of you borings like tacos, and some of you like burritos.And if you're bisexual, you like tacos and burritos. But I'm saying I like tacos andburritos, and I could be into a taco that was born a burrito, or a burrito that is transitioninginto a taco, comprende? And honey, anything else on the … menu. (Linnell 2019)The problem here stems from the misinterpretation of the pansexuality/bisexuality distinctionbecause of a flawed epistemic framework that heterosexual society uses to view bisexuality andpansexuality due the exclusion of intermediary identities on the sexuality continuum perpetratedby the liberal faction.Because of the creation of homonormativity and exclusion that is seen in the liberalfaction of the movement, flawed epistemic frameworks have extended to greater society. Theramifications of this are numerous and dangerous. One of the most dangerous consequences ofallowing these flawed epistemic frameworks to form and be maintained is an increase inhermeneutic injustice. Even though words to describe sexuality and gender are more enhancedthan they were even a few years ago, if those words are artificially restricted because accurateepistemic frameworks are being suppressed, then hermeneutic injustice will continue to exist dueto the fact that those words are not readily available. Furthermore, flawed epistemic frameworkslead to harassment, violence, and even death. Through the epistemic framework created by theRadicalesbians that misrecognized trans women as men that still exists to this day and is utilized151by people all over the world, trans women experience higher rates of harassment, violence, andmurder (“Transgender people over four times more likely than cisgender people to be victims ofviolent crime” 2021). The utilization of flawed epistemic frameworks is dangerous and theliberal faction has supplied the tools to create these faulty frameworks by excluding certainidentities from their activism.Again, none of this is to say that the liberal faction cannot create and/or disseminateknowledge because it can. Homonormativity and transnormativity, as flawed as they are, areforms of knowledge. However, the normativities created by liberal activism do aid in the creationand maintenance of improper epistemic frameworks people use to view the LGBTQ+ communityas demonstrated by quote from Big Mouth (Linell 2019). Just because the knowledge is faultydoes not mean it is not knowledge, but it does mean that it is not as accurate as it can be, whichleads to real world problems as a result of the flawed knowledge being used in the constructionof epistemic frameworks.Knowledge and the Progressive FactionUnlike its liberal counterpart, the progressive faction stifles the permeation of epistemicinjustice and willful hermeneutical ignorance, which allows for the proliferation of accurateknowledge internally and externally. The reason this is able to happen in the progressive factionis because of their inclusion and creation of alternative institutions. With the inclusion of peoplewho had been systematically denied a voice and access to what has come to be known as theLGBTQ+ Movement, those who were part of the progressive faction were exposed to andformed strategies around the unique struggles that come with being at the intersection of multiplemarginalized identities. The creation of alternative institutions, which is a defining feature of theprogressive faction, makes it easier for knowledge to be shared, and in some cases created,152because these institutions and the people who created them have no interest in maintaining thestatus quo.Epistemic InjusticeNeither testimonial injustice nor hermeneutic injustice are significantly present in theprogressive faction. When ONE broke away from Mattachine after 1953, they did not harmpeople’s capacities as knowers because it was politically expedient to do so. Unlike theMattachine Review, ONE was not interested in creating media that prioritized heterosexualfeelings over the realities of being gay (D’Emilio 1983, 87-88). Most importantly, ONE did notbelieve that the psychologist, doctor, lawyer, clergy, professor, etc. knew more about being gaythan gay people did: ONE did not give less credence to the testimony of the homosexual bygiving more credence to the professional like the Mattachine Review did (D’Emilio 1983, 87).By not overinflating the amount of credence given to the testimony of people outside of thecommunity, ONE stifled hermeneutic injustice. The heterosexual professional had little to noidea what it was like being a homosexual in America, but that is who was listened to in the mediaand by Mattachine, which prevented gay people and society from actually knowing what it waslike to be a homosexual. By incorporating the voice of the homosexual in ONE, the organizationwas able to share accurate accounts of what it meant to be gay, which came with giving thecorrect amount of credence to homosexual’s testimony and providing homosexuals and societyaccurate tools to discuss what homosexuality is.The Erickson Educational Foundation was not active in directly stopping or perpetuatingtestimonial injustice; however, EEF did create a foundation to combat hermeneutic injustice viafunding the Gender Identity Clinic and what would eventually become the World ProfessionalAssociation for Transgender Health as well as compiling medical resources for transgender153individuals. Funding GIC and WPATH enabled them to conduct research on gender and formgender confirmation treatments for transgender individuals. This provided society with thecorrect tools to discuss and understand what being transgender means (Nownes 2019, 27).Furthermore, by helping people access gender confirmation treatments, EEF was able to givepeople the epistemic tools needed to make sense of social experiences and themselves (Nownes2019, 18). EEF funded and created resources to understand what transgender identities are,which gave trans people and society the epistemic tools to analyze transgender identities alongwith gender as a whole.Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, Lavender Menace, and theTranssexual/Transvestite Action Organization also worked against epistemic injustice throughinclusion and creating their own media. STAR was an organization for trans people created bytrans people that, amongst other things, created works detailing what it means to be gay and/ortrans and their work served as the foundation for modern queer theory (Cohen 2009, 95-103).The Transsexual Action Organization, similar to STAR, created and published editorialsdescribing the transgender experience to greater society in an effort to share what it means to betransgender (Meyerowitz 2004, 240-41). In all three of these organizations exclusion was notpresent, making it easy to gain a more holistic frame of people’s experiences. Furthermore, allthree created media that gave their community(ies) and, more or less, society epistemic tools toanalyze and understand their experiences.Gay Men’s Health Crisis focused more on combatting hermeneutic injustice thantestimonial injustice. The hotline created by GMHC and their research helped prevent the spreadof hermeneutic injustice by providing people and society with resources to understand whatAIDS is and what it meant to live with the disease (Faderman 2015, 419). While GMHC’s154actions did not help combat testimonial injustice, it still helped allow for the proliferation ofknowledge about the community and AIDS alike. The work of GMHC gave people and societythe knowledge of what it meant to be living with AIDS and how people with AIDS navigatedsociety and life after their diagnosis.The work of ACT UP combats both aspects of epistemic injustice. For the longest timeduring the height of the AIDS crisis women were not given any credence in their testimony aboutliving with AIDS because 1) it conflicted with what professionals had said about the disease and2) women were intentionally medically excluded from having AIDS (Schulman 2019, 385-89;Brier 2009, 173). By ACT UP actively including women there were people who knew thatresearch into AIDS and its classification were problematic because of the CDC’s and NIH’sexclusion of women. This inclusion successfully changed the paradigm around AIDS researchand its classification (Schulman 2019, 385-89; Brier 2009, 173). ACT UP’s fights with AIDSresearch and classification excluding women combined with their other protests anddemonstrations helped combat hermeneutic injustice. Because the women of ACT UP were ableto get research and classification of AIDS changed, women and society would finally understandthe experience of women with AIDS. ACT UP’s demonstrations and protests targeting therelaxed response of AIDS by the government helped create a better understanding of the diseasethat let people with AIDS and society better understand both the disease and what it is like livingwith it (Schulman 2019).The Contemporary Era has also seen a proliferation of knowledge about being LGBTQ+.The Sylvia Rivera Law Project is able to combat hermeneutic injustice in two different ways. Byproviding legal representation to low income trans people and trans people of color, SRLP is ableto elucidate how their clientele interacts with society through a sociolegal lens that is shared with155the court system to hopefully get it to understand how the lens it views SRLP’s clientele throughis problematic (Benjamin 2013, 107). The legal representation provided by SRLP facilitates anunderstanding of how low income trans people and trans people of color interact with socialinstitutions and how the court system views those people. Additionally, by providing training andeducational sessions, SRLP is able to provide members of the LGBTQ+ community and societyan understanding of those identities in the modern day (“Our Approach and Principles/NuestrasPráctica y Principios”, n.d.).FORGE is able to provide a similar service. Through their educational sessions, FORGEteaches people about how being transgender informs the way that people interact with societyand access social resources giving the trans community and society an understanding of thatprocess (“Trainings – FORGE,” n.d.). Furthermore, SONG has been able to allow for theproliferation of LGBTQ+ knowledge through their work. Southerners on New Ground has beenable to engage with other organizations and movements, which gives them a better idea of themany facets of how oppression is interconnected (“Our Mission, Vision & History” 2022). Thisallows people and organizations that fight oppression to have a better understanding of the socialphenomenon they are trying to weaken because they are given a more holistic account ofoppression and its impacts. Additionally, by working in rural communities, SONG is helpinggive more credence to the testimony of the LGBTQ+ community who live in rural areas (“OurMission, Vision & History” 2022). By providing legal assistance, educational sessions, andtraining SRLP, FORGE, and SONG help combat both aspects of epistemic injustice.Willful Hermeneutical IgnoranceThe progressive faction actively attempts to provide people with the correct epistemicframes to view the experiences and lives of people in the LGBTQ+ community. The ability to156provide these new frameworks, or at the very least challenge the ones currently used, comesfrom the third dimension of power. By influencing people’s ideology via working against racism,misogyny, transphobia, classism, and by centering experiences of community members in theiractivism and strategies, the progressive faction is able to provide new ways of thinking about andinterpreting the LGBTQ+ community.Fighting against racism, misogyny, transphobia, and classism while centering LGBTQ+identities is present in all eras of the movement. ONE and EEF, respectively, combattedmisogyny and transphobia in the movement. Mattachine’s framework of viewing homosexualissues was faulty because they routinely questioned the need for the DOB and women’s presencein the movement (D’Emilio 1983, 105). Additionally, Mattachine and the DOB had a narrowview of who the homophile movement should advocate for, which did not include low-incomepeople nor people who further transgressed gender norms (D’Emilio 1983, 106). Furthermore,Mattachine chose to prioritize heterosexual comfort over the needs of gay people (D’Emilio1983, 103). ONE staunchly disagreed with a vast majority of what Mattachine and the DOB weredoing and actively worked to include those who had been excluded from the latter organizations(D’Emilio 1983, 87-88). By working against misogyny and classism in the homophilemovement, ONE helped create a stronger framework for the movement and society to analyzethe experiences and identities of homosexuals as the framework was ow able to make sense ofthe experiences and reification of homosexuality in women, low-income people, and those whofurther transgressed social and gender norms.The Erickson Educational Foundation actively worked against the ubiquity of transphobiaand lack of understanding what gender is, both of which continue to exist. Through fundingresearch into gender and gender affirming care, EEF was able to help create a framework to157adequately analyze the experiences and identities of transgender people as well as how toprovide gender affirming care (Pettis 2015). Because of EEF’s work, the ideas that gender is abinary, that transgender women are men who wear women’s clothes and make a mockery ofwomanhood and seeing transgender men as a butch lesbians were weakened because society wasable to better understand what gender is. The Erickson Educational Foundation fought againsttransphobia and to provide a better understanding of what gender is, which created an epistemicframework for society to view transgender identities, transgender experiences, and gender.In the Gay Liberation Era, Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, Lavender Menace,and the Transsexual/Transvestite Action Organization fought against transphobia, racism, andmisogyny in the movement. STAR created a foundation for queer theory by sharing theexperiences of trans women of color and what it mean to be trans during the mid-20th century,which helped create an epistemic framework that should be used to analyze the identities of transwomen of color (Cohen 2009, 95-103). Lavender Menace shared the lesbian experience with theWomen’s Movement and how the existence of both the Women’s Movement and the GayMovement did not do anything to rectify the issues facing lesbians (Marotta 1981, 244;Faderman 2015, 233). The Transsexual/Transvestite Action Organization also combattedtransphobia and racism. While TAO was in Los Angeles it published Mirage and Moonshadow,which amplified and supported trans voices by publishing trans people’s lived experiences andhow they understood their gender (“Angela Lynn Douglas and Transsexual Action Organization |ONE Archives”, n.d.). One of the protests TAO organized was against the movie MyraBreckenridge because it portrayed a harmful and inaccurate depiction of trans women(Meyerowitz 2004, 238). When TAO moved to Miami, it was inclusive of people of color andcentered their experiences as much as it did the experiences of white trans people (Meyerowitz1582004, 239). Lastly, TAO campaigned to have transgenderism declassified as a mental illness(ibid).The progressive organizations of the Gay Liberation Era created a stronger epistemicframework to view the experiences and identities of transgender people, people of color,lesbians, and those sitting at an intersection of any of those identities. This was achieved throughdestabilizing the epistemic framework that was being used by showing its inaccuracies andlimitations and providing a new framework via testimony about their experiences, identities, andhow the movement was mistaken in its belief that it was working to better the lives of everyone.The epistemic framework created by the progressive organizations in the Gay Liberation Eraprovided a tool to analyze a more holistic LGBTQ+ community, which was given to both themovement and society as a whole.AIDS activism also provided better epistemic frameworks to view both the AIDS crisisand gay identities. Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP both researched AIDS and its effects,which helped give an understanding to the disease (Eleven Years of AIDS and Gay Men's HealthCrisis”, n.d.; Schulman 2019, 9). In addition to AIDS research, GMHC created a hotline toprovide AIDS information, which, combined with research efforts, provided a foundation onwhich to understand and view the AIDS crisis. The Women’s Caucus of ACT UP created anepistemic framework of AIDS that included women, specifically how the disease manifesteditself in women (Brier 2009, 173; Schulman 2019, 246-47). ACT UP as a whole also provided abetter epistemic framework to view the experience of people with AIDS because it researchedthe disease and publicly shared the experiences of people who had been diagnosed (Schulman2019). Combined, the work of GMHC and ACT UP provided a more accurate framework toanalyze the AIDS crisis through because it centered those who were more likely to get the virus159(gay people and intravenous drug users) than how the disease affected the heterosexual familyand friends of HIV positive people. Both GMHC and ACT UP created a holistic epistemicframework to analyze AIDS by fighting against internalized homophobia in the movement and insociety.The Contemporary Era has provided better epistemic frameworks that are used by thelegal system and society. The Sylvia Rivera Law Project has given the court system the ability tocreate a legal framework to recognize transgender identities and experiences through grantingtransgender people access to the court system via accessible representation (Benjamin 2013,107). SLRP’s legal activities also provide the trans community with a framework to view howthey fit in the legal system (ibid). SRLP and FORGE both give service providers a betterepistemic lens to view transgender identities and experiences. Through training and educationalsessions, SLRP and FORGE share the experiences and needs of transgender people who seeksocial and government services (“Our Approach and Principles/Nuestras Práctica y Principios”,n.d; “Webinars – FORGE”, n.d.). The Contemporary Era provides better epistemic frameworksto the transgender community, the legal system, and society to view the experiences and needs oftransgender individuals because they are actively combatting the root cause of unequal treatment:transphobia.SONG is also able to provide a more accurate epistemic frame for the LGBTQ+ andother movements as well. One of SONG’s strategies is to educate other organizations both in andout of the LGBTQ+ Movement on the interconnectedness of oppression (“Our Mission, Vision &History” 2022). As a result of the education provided by SONG, organizations and movementsare able to have a better epistemic frame to view oppression because they now have theknowledge on how different types of oppression connect to each other and can do more work to160mitigate how oppression is reified. Familia also provides greater society with a better epistemicframe to utilize when analyzing the experiences and identity of their constituents because of theirwork to expand resources available to transgender Latinxs (“Programs - Familia: TQLM”, n.d.).By opening up resources or creating their own, Familia is able to show how the currentframework is inadequate for intersectionality-identified people, which gives those who provideresources a better epistemic frame to view the needs of Familia’s constituency.ConclusionSimilar to power and justice, the liberal faction’s capacity to allow for the creation anddissemination of knowledge is not without its flaws. Liberal activism has led to the creation anddissemination of a lot of knowledge about the LGBTQ+ community, but that knowledge is oftenproblematic. The exclusion seen in the liberal faction is the main culprit as it allows forepistemic injustice and willful hermeneutical ignorance to weave their way into liberal activism.The inclusion of these epistemic phenomena in liberal activism means that the knowledgecreated by and disseminated from the liberal faction is not as accurate as it could or should be.Additionally, the exclusion of people and/or experiences that run contrary to the status quo leadsto the development of improper epistemic frameworks used to analyze LGBTQ+ experiences andidentities. While the knowledge produced and disseminated by the liberal faction may not beentirely accurate and can have undesirable consequences, knowledge is still being created andshared with greater society.The progessive faction on the other hand is able to provide proper epistemic frameworksto people. Epistemic injustice and willful hermeneutical ignorance are not as active inprogressive activism, which means that the knowledge it creates and disseminates is moreaccurate than what is produced and disseminated by its liberal counterpart. The knowledge that is161produced and shared by the progressive faction allows for the deconstruction of current, flawedepistemic frameworks that are in use and replace them with better ones. The inclusion seen inprogressive activism allows the progressive faction to provide less flawed knowledge that is usedby the community, the Movement, and greater society because there are fewer barriers tocontribute to the creation of knowledge. Additionally, because progressive activism has nointerest in maintaining the status quo, the progressive faction will not prevent the disseminationof knowledge that runs contrary to it.Just like what was seen with power and justice, the liberal and progressive factions of theLGBTQ+ Movement work parallel to each other. The liberal faction is able to create anddisseminate diluted knowledge to the community and greater society whereas the progressivefaction comes in to conduct quality control by creating and providing accuracy to liberalknowledge. The knowledge created and disseminated by the two prominent factions in theLGBTQ+ Movement is complimentary. The liberal faction provides basic, albeit, flawedepistemic frameworks to society and the progressive faction comes in and amends the flawedparts of the frameworks that are currently being used. The interplay of the two factions allowsfor knowledge that is given to society to be continuously amended and strengthened.162ConclusionIn November of 1950, Henry Hay created what would come to be known as thehomophile movement that would eventually evolve over the course of the next seventy-two yearsto become the LGBTQ+ Movement that we know today (Faderman 2015). In the early days ofthe movement, ideological differences led to a schism that resulted in the formation of twofactions, with the eventual creation of a third, each with radically different strategies than theother to end the oppression of homosexuals. The strategies and actions of the liberal andprogressive factions, whose separation persists to this day, has led to a variety of work andstrategies by each being done to overcome LGBTQ+ oppression. The conclusions that have beendrawn here are the result of analyzing a few exemplary organizations and activist groups in whathas grown to be the LGBTQ+ Movement.The liberal faction is defined as having an arc towards moderation, characterized by areliance on political and professional institutions, and the intentional exclusion of people fromthe movement. The consequences of these defining features are threefold: 1) there is a weakenedability to combat the cause of LGBTQ+ oppression (homophobia, transphobia, racism, classism,etc.), 2) a virtually non-existent ability to provide universal justice for the LGBTQ+ communityas the liberal faction actively denies justice to intersectionaly situated community members, and3) there is a limited ability to establish environments that are conducive to the creation anddissemination of LGBTQ+ specific knowledge. The progressive faction, on the other hand, ischaracterized by a non-reliance on political and professional institutions, making change throughmutual aid and direct action, and active inclusion of people who have been intentionallyexcluded by the liberal faction. These defining features have led to greater success in the areas163where the liberal faction has fallen short. Due to the strategies and ideals of the progressivefaction, it is consistently able to combat the root causes of oppression (homophobia, transphobia,racism, classism, etc.), it is better positioned to provide universal justice for the LGBTQ+community, and they have an ability to create environments that foster the creation andproliferation of LGBTQ+ specific knowledge.The liberal faction of the LGBTQ+ Movement as well as the movement’s predecessorshas shown to be able to consistently influence behavior and agendas while being able toinfluence ideology occasionally. The lack of consistency of influencing ideology shows that theliberal faction is mainly treating symptoms of the social phenomena (homophobia, transphobia,racism, classism, etc.) that lead to oppression instead of the phenomena themselves. The liberalfaction has also actively worked against providing universal justice for their constituents throughtheir penchant for exclusion and desire to create and uphold homonormativity, which means thatliberal strategies will not provide universal relief from oppression. Furthermore, the liberalfaction has stifled the production and dissemination of completely accurate LGBTQ+knowledge, which has resulted in a perpetuation of people’s testimony not being taken seriously,people and society not being able to understand LGBTQ+ identities and experiences, and thecreation and sustaining of flawed epistemic frameworks that can harm the community.Unlike its liberal counterpart, the progressive faction is able to work consistently withinall three dimensions of power, work toward universal justice, and enable the creation anddissemination of LGBTQ+ knowledge. By actively working to change social paradigms, theprogressive faction has shown its ability to work in the third dimension of power because it isable to influence and change ideology. Because the progressive faction includes people whowould otherwise have no voice in the movement and their affinity for creating alternative164institutions, it has been able to provide justice as fairness and justice as recognition andredistribution universally to the community. The progressive faction actively works to increasethe creation and spread of LGBTQ+ knowledge. The proliferation of LGBTQ+ knowledge ismainly seen through inclusion and creation of alternative institutions. Progressive inclusionallows for a more holistic understanding of LGBTQ+ identities because the different ways of theidentities’ reification are present and communicating with each other, which inherently means abetter understanding of people’s experiences within the community. Additionally, the creation ofalternative institutions allows for the proliferation of knowledge because those institutions haveno vested interest in maintaining the status quo because they were created to weaken mainstreaminstitutions by providing a community centric analysis.Both factions have done very important work towards the goal of mitigating theoppression felt by the LGBTQ+ community over the last seventy-two years; however, they havedone so through vastly different techniques that lead to different consequences. Theconsequences of the liberal faction’s actions have been an assimilation of LGBTQ+ identities ina society, systems, and institutions that were made to purposefully exclude them; the liberalfaction tries to conform to social norms, mores, and behaviors instead of changing those to bemore inclusive and welcoming of LGBTQ+ identities. The consequences of progressive activismare more liberatory in nature. Instead of trying to include LGBTQ+ identities into a society,systems, and institutions that were made to exclude them, they try to change social norms,mores, and behaviors to eradicate their exclusionary tendencies. Unfortunately, the suppressionof accurate knowledge creation and dissemination seen as a result of liberal activism can beharmful because it may eventually prevent any kind of inclusive change to a homophobic,transphobic, racist society we currently find ourselves in.165While the liberal and progressive factions have different strategies and abilities forovercoming oppression faced by the LGBTQ+ community, both have the same goal: to free theLGBTQ+ community of social injustice and maltreatment. Both have, to varying degrees, beensuccessful in the seventy-two years since the movement’s nascent days. Because of the workdone by both, members of the LGBTQ+ community are becoming increasingly recognized aslegitimate members of society at large; the degree to which members of the LGBTQ+community are considered social pariahs has been mitigated, they enjoy greater access to civilrights, and homophobia, while still strong in some quarters, no longer holds the same strengthnor ubiquity it once did. While the liberal faction works within the status quo and the progressivefaction works outside of it, both factions have worked parallel to each other to facilitate socialchange that would not have otherwise been achieved. Because these factions work in conjunctionwith each other, the LGBTQ+ community’s standing has increased over the last 72 years.It is really easy to look at the analysis of the liberal and progressive factions of theLGBTQ+ Movement and pass moral judgment on them for one reason or another, but we mustrefrain from doing so because it will only serve to entrench the infighting of the LGBTQ+Movement. The differences seen between the factions allow the Movement to be as strong as itis. The progressive faction supplementing its liberal counterpart allows for a model ofsustainable activism and social change because it forces the Movement to be critical of itself,understand where the flaws in current strategies lay, and how to rectify parts of itself that leads tosub-par activism. By working parallel to each other, the liberal and progressive factions havebeen able to create a social movement that allows for continuous, sustainable change that is ableto reflect on itself, its strategies, and the outcomes of its activism and work to better its flaws.Without both of the factions working in concert with each other, it is doubtful as to whether or166not members of the LGBTQ+ community would have the standing that they currently do insociety.Even though this work has been an analysis of a movement that has grown into theLGBTQ+ Movement, the application of analyzing pressure groups through this lens does not endhere. The LGBTQ+ Movement is a pilot for an analysis of pressure groups through the lens ofpower, justice, and knowledge. The purpose of the framework of power, justice, and knowledgeis to evaluate pressure groups’ ability to create effective change for their constituency. Thisframework can be applied to any number of different pressure groups regardless of if they are asocial movement or not because all forms of pressure groups have varying degrees of power,ability to provide justice, and capacity to allow knowledge to proliferate.167References“About Us.” n.d.

    "abstract": "Includes bibliographical references.2022 Fall.Social movements are important to understand when studying the reification of democracy because they are a mode of political action that is frequently utilized for a wide variety of causes by diverse sets of people. This work explores the differences of power, justice, and knowledge in the progressive and liberal factions of the LGBTQ+ Movement and what that means for both the LGBTQ+ community and society. Using a historical analysis of the strategies and actions of the liberal and progressive factions of what has grown to be the LGBTQ+ Movement an examination with a lens of power provided by Lukes (2021), justice as fairness advocated for by Rawls (1958; 1971;2001), justice as recognition and redistribution put forth by Fraser (1997) and Honneth (2004), epistemic injustice theorized by Fricker (2007), and willful hermeneutical ignorance formulated by Pohlhaus (2012) will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of change the two factions are able to create",
