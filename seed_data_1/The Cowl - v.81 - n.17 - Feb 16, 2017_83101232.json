During each Friar Legends Forever Jersey Retirement Event numbers get retired, legacies are revisited and the student body is reminded that there are all-time Friar legacies whose names are not Kris Dunn ’16. With the the Class of 2017 inductions over the weekend of Feb. 10,   Friar Athletics honored yet again some of the biggest names in its history.These are men and women who excelled not only in their time at PC but far beyond it as well. Among those recognized this weekend were Otis Thorpe ’84 and the late Bruce “Soup” Campbell ’78, men’s basketball players while at PC.Thorpe was a massive 6’10” power forward who averaged 14.4 PPG and eight rebounds per game while at PC. His best season as a Friar was during his 1983-1984 senior year, when he averaged a double double (17.1 PPG and 10.3 rebounds) and almost single-handedly brought the team its first winning season of the 1980s. With an even more illustrious NBA career, culminating in an all-star appearance in 1992 and a NBA championship in 1994 with the Houston Rockets, Campbell was another Friar legend who played for the men’s basketball team from 1974 to 1978. Otis Thorpe  ’84 waves to the crowd at the Dunkin’ Donut Center.Saturday morning, Katharine Comber ’18, Emily Ventura ’18, and Grace George ’19 drove to Walmart armed with a list of supplies and a budget of $250. They slowly checked the items off their list—chapstick, cough drops, gloves, and Valentine’s Day candy—and left with armfuls of bags. But these supplies are not going home— they are going to the homeless.One goal for Providence College’s Students for Social Action (SSA), a club aimed at tackling social issues and performing community service, is to help the homeless community this semester. “The homeless population is frequently overlooked in society, and so we wanted to help them around Valentine’s Day to show them that there are people that care about them,” said Comber, president of SSA.So what exactly do shopping bags have to do with the homeless? The Walmart trip was one of many steps that allowed the club of 30 to launch their first annual “blessing bags” mission. Aimed at providing the necessities for people on the streets, the bags include everyday items that meet the needs of both men and women.“We focused on toiletries,” said Ventura, vice president. “From research, we found food is sometimes more accessible and toiletries are more expensive.” GRAPHIC DESIGN BY KATIE PUZYCKI  ’17/THE COWLAs a chorus of voices that are singular yet harmonious, unique and still complimentary, A cappella at Providence College almost epitomizes the Friar Family—that bond encompassing the campus and the alumni beyond it.

It is a word that connotes commitment, perseverance, and continuity; in other words, it demands nothing short of everything. To say that something is “forever” is to make a bold and confident assertion about its future. And yet, a century ago, the founders of Providence College did make this assertion when they used the word “forever” to conclude the opening sentence of the charter that established the College as an institution of higher learning.Although PC is a long way from forever, it came one step closer to it this past Tuesday, February 14, as the College celebrated the 100th anniversary of receiving its charter from the state of Rhode Island. Members of both the PC and Rhode Island communities gathered at the State House to celebrate this momentous occasion.Andrew Konnerth ’17, executive president of the 67th Student Congress, served as the event’s MC, greeting PC representatives and government officials alike. Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo began by welcoming the College to the statehouse. She stated that the College “is more than just a premiere liberal arts institution—it is a part of the fabric of the Rhode Island community.” She applauded PC for fostering the value of civic engagement in its students. This duty to the community is so strong, Raimondo stated, that 14 out of the House of Representative’s 75 members are former Friars. Indeed, one of the representatives is none other than Evan Shanley—the nephew of Fr. Brian Shanley, O.P. ’80. It was Raimondo who then presented Fr. Shanley with a statement declaring Feb. 14 the official “Providence College Day” in the state of Rhode Island.Next to the podium was Speaker of the House Nicholas Mattiello. Mattiello echoed Raimondo’s feelings, remarking how PC “adds to our community, and has always been a beacon of light to the city of Providence.”Also offering her congratulations was President of the Senate Teresa Paiva Weed ’81, another PC grad, who joked, “Fr. Shanley only has one year on me!” She expressed gratitude for her time as a Friar, stating, “The lessons I learned at PC prepared me not only for law school and my professional career, but also for life.”Weed emphasized how “the state [of Rhode Island] and the College have always been closely intertwined.” Pointing to her class ring, she told the assembly that two Diversity has been a flashpoint issue on the Providence College campus for the last year. After an alleged incident against an African-American student at a party last year, students protested against the treatment and exclusion of colored people at PC.  Additionally, a protest broke out last year following the publication of an article by Dr. Anthony Esolen that commented on what diversity means on a Catholic campus. Many students disagreed with the ideas Esolen put forth concerning diversity. More recently, a solidarity walk occurred on campus to show support for immigrants affected by President Trump’s recent executive order. The issue of diversity has been contentious on the PC campus, and more recently, has been brought into the forefront as an issue in America as a whole. The issue of diversity and Catholic identity were explored in an event that was part of the Difficult Dialogues Initiative that took place this Wednesday. The event was titled “Six Views on Catholic and Dominican Identity and Contemporary Approaches to Diversity.” An invitation to attend the dialogue was extended to all members of the Providence College community. Around 100 students, staff, faculty, and alumni attended the dialogue. The dialogue was organized by the Office of Institutional Diversity, and was opened by remarks from PC President Fr. Brian Shanley, O.P. ’80, who expressed the views of a conference of Catholic schools, that he recently attended in Washington, D.C., which explored “diversity as an expression of the grandeur of God.” Shanley said he wished to bring this idea and its implication back to the PC campus. The talk opened with seven different speakers who addressed the question: what is the greatest challenge connecting Catholic and Dominican identity with contemporary understanding of diversity? The first speaker was Dr. Patrick Breen, an associate professor of history. Breen told the story of a 19th century slave in North Carolina who was allowed to choose her own master. The slave chose a man she knew from church, believing his faith would make him a good master. Instead, Breen recounted how this slave master did not provide for the basic needs of his slaves. Breen pointed out how the master’s faith was insufficient, and how it demonstrated the “complex and sometimes paradoxical nature of humans.” Breen believes that it is important to keep this aspect of human nature in mind when discussing diversity.The next speaker was Michael Bartels ’18, president of the history club. Bartels detailed the current political climate of America and how it related to ideas about diversity. Bartels believes that the current trend in politics to attack the supporters of a political figure led to a need to defend one’s identity instead of a search for truth. Many people believe themselves to be “inevitably right,” and do not open themselves up to understand the worldview of others. The next speaker, Dr. Jennifer Illuzzi, associate professor of history, emphasized the need to create a new story for PC, one that takes into account all its diversity and history. Illuzzi pointed out that one needs to confront the darker aspects of the history of Christianity, along with recognizing the liberating message of the Gospel.    The fourth speaker was Nicholas Sailor ’17, who contrasted the difference between the ideals of Catholic thought and the practical challenges of implementing it. He also expressed his worry about the void of support he has found in his effort to confront and explore issues of diversity. Dr. Matthew Cuddeback,  assistant professor of philosophy, then tackled the issue of the place of LGBTQ people at a Catholic institution. He pointed out the fact that the  Church has clear teachings against homosexual relations, and stated that PC needs to confront its relationship to these ideas. Tiffany Gaffney, assistant dean of students, also addressed the issue of LGBTQ students. Gaffney insisted on love as a starting point for such dialogue; she said it important to make LGBTQ students feel loved, first and foremost, and then work through challenges from that starting point. Finally, Rev. Nicanor Austriaco, O.P., professor of biology and theology, described how the experience of being discriminated against changed the way that he thought. He described discrimination as a “habituation of the soul,”  and said that experiences of marginalization can change one’s worldview. After the speakers had concluded, participants were broken into small groups to discuss what had been said. Some of the questions that the small groups encountered included: does PC have a lack of consensus about its Catholic identity? Should PC  aspire to be all things to all people? Does everyone on campus have a clear understanding of what the Catholic and Dominican mission is? All these questions will need to be addressed moving forward, as PC struggles to reconcile its Catholic identity to a growing desire for and presence of diversity. of the ring’s features are an anchor and the word “hope,” the very symbols on the Rhode Island state flag.Fr. Shanley was next to address the gathered community. He acknowledged how there is more pressure than ever for institutions of higher education to deliver results in terms of future career paths. And yet, while conferring nearly 54,000 undergraduate degrees over the past century, Fr. Shanley stated how PC’s liberal arts education does even more than that, as it “shapes the hearts and minds of students to live good and virtuous lives.”He took pride in the fact that PC students, through both their academic and extra-curricular efforts, develop into leaders, thinkers, and “go-getters.” He stressed the College’s commitment to service by highlighting its public and community service major, which was the first of its kind in the nation.Fr. Shanley recognized and thanked the state of Rhode Island for its role in establishing the College. He thanked God for His divine providence, and he eagerly anticipated the next 100 years of serving the Rhode Island community.The final speaker was Dr. Richard Grace, professor emeritus of the history department and PC’s resident historian. Grace gave a brief historical perspective of the College, recounting how PC’s founders worked to get civil and ecclesiastical approval for the College. A copy of the charter was on display at the State House, and Grace revealed how PC’s founders started the College with a mere $35,000. He emphasized how it financed itself thanks to the support of local parishes and immigrant populations who raised money to keep PC’s doors open.The ceremony concluded with a performance by I Cantori, PC’s premier student choral ensemble.

As she walked with fellow classmates into Raymond Dining Hall, she noticed the people around her quickly moving to avoid something on the floor. What was going on with the sporadic movements that left people jumping away from her? Nothing too crazy—just a little superstition.Ingram soon found out that the weird behavior she was witnessing was simply to avoid a circle in Ray with theschool insignia. Rumor had it that one step on the seal would bring bad luck. Ingram laughs as she thinks back to the superstition, something she personally never believed in, while Dr. Raymond Sickinger ’71, history department chairperson and professor, recalls always avoiding the circle like most students at the time. Fast forward to 2017, and the circle has moved but the superstition is the same. Most students on campus agree that everyone must avoid walking on the plain grey circle in front of St. Dominic’s Chapel or face the consequences.Alexandra Jones ’17, who firmly believes in avoiding the circle, first heard about the curse on a school tour. Her guide said, “If students step in the circle, they won’t graduate. If parents [step in], they won’t get good financial aid.”  And, while there may be some who doubt the power of the circle, Joe Flynn ’15 ’17G said his sister, who didn’t hold the same belief, stepped on the circle during a tour and never got into PC.The origins of the superstition remain unknown, but Jones thinks it might be like people spinning on circles before boarding a plane. If there is a “circle somewhere, you have to do something [even though] it doesn’t make sense,” said Jones.Some are avid believers in the circle’s powers, others just see the circle as concrete. But whether it is a seal in Ray or a circle near the chapel, most students might agree with Michael Scott from The Office who says, “I’m not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.”Scream Like You Mean It:It was the best of times, it was the worst times: It was Civ. Since its formation in 1971, Development of Western Civilization (DWC) has been a unique part of PC’s liberal arts education. Students study thousands of years of history across multiple disciplines, learning about the cultures that shaped the Western world.DWC is also notoriously difficult. The essays are complex, the seminars are long, and the homework is never ending. In celebration of finally conquering long nights of studying and hard work, students gather the night before their final DWC exam Honorable Mentions:To cover all superstitions and traditions over 100 years would be impossible, but here are some that have survived the test of time:Rumor has it that Dore Hall, along with other lower campus buildings that used to be part of a medical institution, is haunted by the ghosts of patients.While most students are glad to wear jeans and T-shirts to class, students before 1971 used to follow a dress code of a sports coat and tie. Freshmen were also forced to wear small hats with their class year on them, allowing seniors to identify and order them around. You have never really lived at PC if you have not hung out on the Quad, sled down Guzman Hill, or taken a picture with the country’s creepiest mascot: Friar Dom.As PC flies into the future and looks forward to another 100 years of success, it brings tradition, for better or worse, along with it.and scream out two years of feelings.Flynn said Civ Scream is simply freshmen getting excited because it is their first one, sophomores feeling glad to be done with DWC, juniors usually not being interested, and seniors going crazy—“it’s the thing before graduation and commencement.” Dr. Sickinger can recall Civ Scream being an event when he returned to PC as a professor in 1974. Ever since then, students have continually gathered to celebrate surviving DWC and having a night of fun.Every Civ Scream is different and, after a seemingly long period of silence and waiting, crazy events take place. Students in just the past five years have seen everything from burning couches and fireworks to students streaking across campus. Mascot costumes and horse masks always make an appearance and sometimes students go for a swim in mini pools and slip ‘n slides.Recent PC classes have failed to have this classic DWC experience. Security has heightened over the past few years to control any crowds and prevent property damage. Although he knows it can get out of hand some years, Flynn says he is glad to have experienced Civ Scream during his time at PC. “It’s a fun tradition,” he said, “And a cathartic release.”Superstitions and Traditions of the Past 100 YearsNICHOLAS CRENSHAW ’20/THE COWLNICHOLAS CRENSHAW ’20/THE COWLPHOTO COURTESY OF PROVIDENCE.EDUNEWS4 The Cowl February 16, 2017Day One Supports Survivors of Sexual Assault by Sabrina Guilbeault ’18Assistant News EditorON CAMPUSIn an effort to create greater advocacy for victims of sexual assault, Providence College has partnered with Day One: The Sexual Assault & Trauma Center, a non-profit organization whose mission is to reduce the prevalence of sexual abuse and violence, as well as to offer support to those who have been affected by it.  The partnership is a memorandum of agreement, and links Courtney Miner, an advocacy coordinator at the agency, to the College as the Victim Advocacy, Support & Education (V.A.S.E) coordinator. “The relationship we’ve built with Day One is authentic and trustworthy and is one that is helping the College,” said Dr. James Campbell, Title IX coordinator and assistant vice president for student development. According to Dr. Campbell, PC has had connections with the agency for a long time, and has referred students to use their statewide services. Some services Day One offers include: a 24-hour Helpline and legal advocacy, law enforcement advocacy programs, individual and group counseling, and prevention education workshops. Miner’s role as the V.A.S.E. coordinator began after the College reached out to Day One to get their professional opinion on what PC could do better with their response to sexual assault on campus. Her new role officially began this past November. “Since the first time they approached me, something that I’ve seen at PC that I do not necessarily see on other campuses is a real devotion to making sure they are doing the best they can to prevent sexual assault,” said Miner. “They are more than willing to take advice from Day One, and I am very excited by the open communication between us and PC.” Dr. Campbell explained that with partnering with Day One, the College can benefit from their resources and expertise. “We’ve been able to fine tune our procedures,” he said. “We’ve made strong connections with their Law Enforcement Advocates which makes it easier when there is a sexual assault for students to file complaints to the police.” Miner explained that the Law Enforcement Advocates is something that makes her most proud of being part of an agency like Day One. According to Day One’s website, Law Enforcement Advocates are “Advocates employed by Day One and other victim service agencies in the state, but are physically based out of local police departments.” The advocates have access to the police Department’s reporting system and follow-up with every sexual assault (or domestic violence) victim that has reported to the police. Dr. Campbell explained a huge benefit to Law Enforcement Advocates is that they help to minimize the number of times victims have to tell their stories. “If someone who is interviewing a victim is not trained, the interview process can be traumatic,” he said. As for her role as the V.A.S.E. coordinator, Miner explained she can go with victims to any hearings, meet with them on or off campus, and is willing to speak with them at any time. “My main purpose is to make sure victims are informed so they can make informed decisions,” she said. “I’m not making decisions for them, but helping them make informed decisions during the process and support them through that.”According to an article published by The Cowl in December 2015, Student Affairs held a community gathering to explain the College’s role in dealing with matters of sexual assault, and presented results from the previous spring’s Sexual Misconduct and Relationship Violence Campus Climate Survey. The survey was meant to cover the “scope and nature of violence and experiences of sexual assault on campus.” Dr. Campbell explained that the survey held the most comprehensive data regarding sexual assault at Providence College, but it is not entirely accurate as not everyone took the survey. Presented at last year’s community gathering, the survey had a 28 percent response rate and found that “21 percent of those surveyed experienced at least one form of unwanted sexual conduct since the onset of the 2014-2015 school year.” “Unwanted sexual conduct” can include oral sex, sex, attempted oral sex, attempted sex, and unwanted fondling. Dr. Campbell explained that a follow-up town hall like meeting is likely to be held this April, during Sexual Assault Awareness Week. Both Dr. Campbell and Miner explained that they would like to see more bystander training programs, violence prevention talks, and student advocacy on campus. “The biggest task now is getting the word out there,” said Miner. She explained the prevalence of in person outreach and how she is glad she has gotten to meet with student groups, such as Residence Life, Student Congress, and Women Will. “When students call the V.A.S.E number, I want them to know they are not just calling a number, but calling a person you know.” “Courtney has been great,” said Dr. Campbell. “She’s very receptive and always available to meet with student groups to discuss her role.” He also stated that he has met with her and other member of Day One on collaborative measures at least once a month. Dr. Campbell mentioned that he recognizes that it is easy to assume what is or is not happening on campus in regards to sexual assault. “Most of our process is confidential, so from the outside our polices may not make sense, but that is because a lot of work is being done behind the scenes,” he said. “Trust and credibility helps people feel more confident that things are being handled.” He went on to explain how easily trust is shattered after a sexual assault, and therefore it is beneficial working with a V.A.S.E. coordinator with credibility, as it gives greater confidence to victims. “There’s a huge benefit in working with Courtney because [there is an]  increased confidence that people have in the process,” he said. “I am very excited to start this and be a part of the community,” said Miner. “I am so impressed with how kind and supportive the staff and students have been. Even of its just a question or comment, I definitely encourage students to reach to me, because that’s what I’m here for.” Miner can be contacted at (401) 280-0564 .

Claire Kleinschmidt ’17 is one of these students. When asked about her thoughts on allowing students of different class years to live together, Kleinschmidt responded, “Living with seniors as a junior allowed me to meet and engage with a new group of PC students and really become more a part of the campus community.“I learned so much from them and their experience transitioning out of PC that I felt really prepared for senior year,” she continued. “Now, as a senior with a few junior roommates, I have really enjoyed being able to live with people I have formed close relationships with, regardless of their class year.”In addition to this change, an entire floor in Fennell Hall will be reserved for first year students. In the past, freshmen have requested single rooms and Residence Life was unable to accommodate. With this   change, special programming and community building will take place in order to ensure a comfortable community for first year students living alone. Residence Life hopes that these changes will give students better living environments and allow them to dedicate more time and energy to other pursuits,  ensuring that stresses of college do not revolve around housing.constantly preoccupies students’ minds. With all of these concerns floating around, the Office of Residence Life is doing its part to make housing one less problem for students at Providence College. Residence Life is making a few changes to housing. Next year is the first year that juniors are not permitted to live off campus, which means that more juniors will need on-campus housing than ever before. Junior year housing is already difficult due to the fact that many juniors go abroad for a semester, and Residence Life acknowledges that it can be extremely difficult for juniors to form full groups to fill rooms.In an effort to aid students, Residence    sdLi fe  i s  a l lowing sophomores and juniors to live together to give students a larger pool to pick from for housing. Jana Valentine, director of the Office of Residence Life, said that in the past, students have asked if it was possible for juniors and sophomores to live together and were told no. Now, Residence Life is accommodating these students.Valentine and Steven Sears, dean of students and the associate vice president for student affairs, discussed the change and sought out student feedback. Sears stated that he asked Student Congress for their thoughts on the matter, and that both resident assistants and hall directors were also consulted.While the decision was made in the hopes of filling gaps in junior housing, that is not the primary concern of Residence Life. Valentine stated, “I want students to live with other students that they’re compatible with. I want students to have great experiences with their roommates. Sometimes that doesn’t happen because of class year restrictions. Having first year students live with other first years is a very positive experience, but I believe that there is a lot of mentoring that can happen within class years at levels above first year.” In past years, juniors and seniors have been permitted to live with one another. The feedback from students who have taken advantage of this opportunity has There are many factors that affect what an average college student worries about throughout the day.

Victoria Palmer ’18, secretary, said, “Everyone donates during Thanksgiving and Christmas and forgets about the giving season in January and February, the coldest months.”Deciding what to put in the bags and how many to make was a difficult process. Comber, Ventura, and Palmer, along with Treasurer Keaundra Lawson ’18 and Public Relations and Media correspondent Grace George, spent weeks researching what items to include and hunting down the best bargains.In the end, the club made 50 blessing bags that included toothbrushes, floss, cough drops, band-aids, tissues, soap, toothpaste, snacks, and Valentine’s Day candy, among other items. The bags also had gender-specific items, adding chapstick for men and gloves and pads for women.When asked if there were any items that especially stuck out to them, Ventura said buying tampons had the biggest impact on her because “[they are for] a personal need that women don’t have control over.”Overall, the club members felt the mission was a huge success. The idea for the blessing bags originated last year when exec member Kristen Perelli ’16 saw Facebook and Pinterest posts about people keeping bags of supplies in their cars for homeless people they saw on the street. At the time, SSA did not have funding from Student Congress and was unable to carry out the event.The idea was not forgotten, however, and club members this year decided it was worth continuing the work that past members started. They decided to take the individual act and make it a group effort for homeless centers in the area. “It was just an idea last spring semester and this spring semester we actually followed through with it and only hope to make it bigger next year,” said Ventura.The supplies from the shopping trip were later packaged by an assembly line of club volunteers. The blessing bags will now be donated mainly to Crossroads Homeless Shelter and, if there are extra, potentially to the people of Riverwood Mental Health and House of Hope.SSA hopes to make next year’s event even bigger, gaining more donations from the PC community and local stores. They look forward to continually talking about social issues and finding events to support in the coming semester, whether it is talking about sexual assault on campus or showing support for the Providence Women’s March.  A trip to Walmart or packaging drinks into a bag may seem like a small act but, as Comber pointed out, “most students don’t work with the homeless,” and these events  “bring awareness to social issues happening on campus and off campus too.”For Providence College students, the month of February signals that the semester is well underway. Students have memorized their class schedules, figured out homework and gym routines, and—more often than not—kept an eager eye on the weekly snow forecasts. All too frequently, however, February also announces the arrival of something a little less welcome: flu season. To help students both prevent and care for the flu, The Cowl sat down with the Student Health Center’s physician, Dr. Suzanne Bornschein, M.D., who came armed with advice on how to best combat this virus.Cowl: A couple of weeks ago the student body received an email warning about a flu outbreak. Do we know what particular flu strain we have here at PC?Suzanne Bornschein: With support of Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) we were able to determine that we have an Influenza A -H3 strain. There may also be a secondary B strain present, but for the most part it appears that our students are sick with an A strain. This is good news because the flu shot this year has protection against the A-H3 strain.Cowl: How can you prevent and treat the flu?SB: Flu shots are the single best way to prevent the flu. The earlier the better. Health services offered sdssseveral on-campus student flu shot clinics during the fall, and if students missed those they can always go to their primary care doctors or to local pharmacies. The CVS and Walgreens on Admiral Street are  the perfect places to get the shot.Cowl: dsdHow doesfdf the government determine  which strains to protect against in  the flu shot?SB: The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) works with the World Health Organization (WHO) to track influenza strains throughout the world and determine what strains are most likely to be the predominant strains for the coming year.  There are  three different strains in each flu shot. The CDC also has a flu tracker that is updated weekly and shows where the flu is, how prevalent it is, and what the particular strains are.Cowl: Once a person receives the shot, how long does it take for him or her to become immune to the flu? How long does your flu shot last?SB: It takes two weeks to reach full immunity. But during those two weeks you have partial immunity, so that’s still something. [It lasts] all year. A great time to get your flu shot is in August before you go back to school. Cowl: You said that the shot lasts all year, but when specifically is the peak flu season?SB: The peak season is in February, but numbers are still very high in January and March. We predict that the flu season will go into March and even April, so it’s definitely not too late to go get a flu shot!Cowl: Some people have mentioned something called Tamiflu. What is it, and what does it do?SB: I do get asked about Tamiflu a lot. Tamiflu is an anti-viral drug—an oseltamivir—that can be taken as both a preventative drug and a treatment for the flu. If someone comes in with flu-like symptoms, we can offer them Tamiflu as a treatment strategy that will reduce the length of the illness and make them less contagious. It is a different dosage—once a day for 14 days—and it definitely decreases the likelihood of getting the full flu-like illness. Tamiflu, however, is no substitute for a flu shot.Cowl: How can someone differentiate between the cold and the flu?SB: Classically, flu presents itself with a fever, headache, and body ache—it’s really just a malaise, that beautiful French word for not feeling well. Upper respiratory symptoms, like coughing, sneezing, and even sore throat are also very common. When people come in with flu-like symptoms, initially we offer testing for the flu. Once there is a certain percentage of positive flu swabs, we can become an outbreak site. The RIDOH determined a flu outbreak site here around three weeks ago, and so now we’re past swabbing. Flu swabs are not sensitive tests, which means that there is a 30-50 percent chance of a false negative. At this point, if students come in looking like they have the flu, we treat them for the flu. Cowl: How is the illness spread?SB: In a college community, population density makes it so much easier to share germs and viruses. If you have multiple people sharing a room or a kitchen, you increase the chances of catching something. The flu is aerosolized, meaning that it is transmitted through airborne droplets. This means that, rather than sterilizing surfaces, students should practice proper cold techniques. Covering your sneezes and coughs with your elbow is the best way to do this.Cowl: Who is most susceptible to the flu?SB: The people we worry about are people with underlying illnesses—for example, patients with diabetes, asthma, and people taking immunosuppressant drugs, because these are the people who can  get complications from the flu. We want to make sure they come forward and take preventive medication!Cowl: Finally, what should people do if they are indeed diagnosed with the flu?SB: To put it simply, we want them to socially isolate and wear a face mask in public settings until the fever is under 100 degrees for 24 hours. Communicate with your professors, alert your RAs, and get a “flu buddy” to bring you food and medicine. We have a kind, caring community here at PC—ask a friend or roommate to bring you Gatorade, Tylenol, flu bags from the health center, etc. Practice self-care; give yourself time to rest and recover so you can be up and moving again as soon as possible.PHOTO COURTESY OF SEEDTOFEEDME.BLOGSPOT.COMDon’t wait!

Dorn was lucky enough to join the TFA team to help recruit PC’s best and brightest aspiring teachers. The program requires participants to commit two years after college to teach students in impoverished school districts where 80 percent of students do not go on to attend college. Along with full benefits, teachers are given extensive cultural agility training and proper course certification instruction. Students of all majors are encouraged to get involved, as they believe a core of diverse teachers leads to success in the classroom. For students who are interested, please contact jdorn@friars.providence.edu by March 3. AnnouncementsThis coming Friday, several members of the 67th will be attending a lunch with Father Shanley, O.P., to discuss many topics; from the upcoming Black & White Ball to the recent diversity initiatives PC has undertaken. The Class of 2017 will be holding their “117 Nights ’Till Graduation” event on Feb. 24, with tickets being sold at $5 and semi-formal dress encouraged. Sophomores were encouraged to join the SRW Core, and all those who are interested should contact Caroline Cook ’19, as soon as possible. Old & New BusinessPublicity member Sabrina Guilbeault ’18 continued to work on her New Student Coupon Booklet. Guilbeault shared that PC Card Office could not make the coupon booklet accessible via PC ID swipes, but was optimistic it could happen in the near future. The piece was also changed to include not only freshmen, but all new students (transfers included). The legislation was passed. New Business was introduced this week by Class of 2018 Representative Mike Bartels ’18 in regard to changing the language of the student handbook pertaining to alcohol paraphernalia. Bartel’s goal was to minimize the grey area that currently exists, and hopes that the legislation will lighten up stress and paperwork for both students and residence life. The legislation will be voted on next week. Next WeekNext week, Fr. Peter Martyr, O.P., will be attending the meeting to continue discussions from his visit last semester. All students are welcome to attend at 5:30 p.m. in Ruane LL05.Last week the city of Providence experienced a mild 50 degree day followed 24 hours later by a blistering cold snowstorm. Changes in the environment have been apparent all across the country, and it is imperative to start paying attention to them.  At Providence College, the Student Environmental Action Coalition (SEAC) is not only conscious of these environmental changes, but they are striving to take action. “Our mission is to educate ourselves and the greater PC community about existing environmental issues, to make PC a more sustainable campus, and to increase interest in and respect for our environment,” said Co-President Angela Mascena ’17. Mascena,  along with  C o - P r e s i d e n t Shannon Law-Clark ’17, leads a club of about 20 members.T h e  c l u b sponsors a  series of events every year such as decorating a recycling bin, activities in honor of world water week, and local beach cleanups. The club also hosts other special events that differ from year to year. “This past December we held an info session and Q&A about the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy,” said Mascena. “We had two guest speakers from the Fighting Against Natural Gas (FANG) Collaborative who lived and worked at the camps and protested at Standing Rock earlier in 2016.” SEAC also organizes regular trips to local farmers’ markets and sponsors nature hikes to promote environment appreciation.  In looking towards environmental issues on a national level, SEAC believes that these events cannot be dismissed. “We are genuinely concerned about the lack of attention the environment is currently getting from the White House,” said Mascena. “We believe that, for the sake of our planet and the future of the species that reside on it, sustainability needs to be a priority on the national and international level.” SEAC meets most Thursdays at 6:30 p.m. in Feinstein 315. For those who are interested in joining, email SEAC secretary Mitch Schrich ’18 at mschrich@friars.providence.edu. Tension increased this past week between North Korea and the United States and its allies as North Korea successfully tested a new nuclear missile. The new missile is called the Pukguksong-2, and it was launched Sunday about 310 miles into the Sea of Japan. The distance is short of the estimated rage of the missile, which is around 1,864 to 3,417 miles.The development of the Pukguksong-2 missile has caused the United States and its allies anxiety because the new technology of the missile makes it much harder to have a preemptive warning of a missile launch. The new missile is a solid-fuel rocket, meaning it does not require the long process of fuel-loading in order to function properly. It can be stored on mobile launchers, rolled out, and prepared for launch within minutes, if the North Korean reports are to be believed. This would make it much harder to receive warning of a missile launch through satellite technology. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-Un, claimed, “Now our rocket industry has radically turned into a high-thrust solid-fuel-powered engine from liquid-fuel rocket engine and rapidly developed into a development and creation-oriented industry, not just copying samples.” Defense officials in the area say that North Korean missiles do not yet have the ability that Kim Jong-Un claims, but that the launch of the Pukguksong-2 represents significant advances in the stealth and range of these missiles.The test took place while a state dinner was being held between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe. Aides interrupted the dinner at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to bring both leaders reports of the missile test. Abe called the missile test “absolutely intolerable.” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, meanwhile, echoed Abe’s words, stating that the test was a “clear provocation to Japan and the region.”A United Nations Security Council meeting was requested by the United States, Japan, and South Korea in response to the missile launch. The United States Security Council responded that it plans to hold consultations on an “urgent basis.” Tokyo has lodged protests against North Korea through its embassy in Beijing.Despite being allies of North Korea, both China and Russia also spoke out against the missile launch. China denies the need to take any greater responsibility in curbing the actions of North Korea, but the Foreign Ministry said that China is opposed to launch activities that are in violation of UN resolutions. China is North Korea’s most important ally, and helps to keep it afloat economically amidst crippling sanctions. Yet, the recent rhetoric concerning the launch of the Pukguksong-2 reflects a trend in which China has begun to take a tougher stand on the North Korean nuclear program.  The Foreign Ministry of Russia, another important North Korean ally, said that the missile launch was in “defiant disregard” of UN resolutions. This missile test is the first since Trump’s inauguration, and it can be seen as the first foreign challenge to the Trump administration. So far, the response of President Trump has been to issue a joint statement with Abe, in which he said that he had “100  percent support” for Japan, and called them “a great ally.” PHOTO COURTESY OF GARBHO.COMThe map above shows the range of the new Pukguksong-2 missile’s trajectory.

As the head of the Department of Justice, Sessions will be in charge of preventing crime and terrorism within the United States and ensuring that all those who break the law are prosecuted. For American citizens who care about equality and justice, the two national virtues that Sessions is now obliged to uphold, the appointment of a bigoted racist and a staunch conservative who believes in the elimination of many civil rights acts should create an enormous angst about the future of all minority Americans.Trump’s decision to appoint Sessions extends his growing lack of concern for issues such as the treatment of the LGBTQ community and civil rights. Just as Trump removed the LGBTQ rights page from the website hours into his presidency, his choice of Sessions as the new attorney general shows how by Kevin Copp ’18Opinion StaffPOLITICSlittle respect members of the LGBTQ community will receive during the Trump presidency. During his last complete Senate term, from early 2015 to early 2017, Sessions received a rating of zero from the Human Rights Campaign, which measures how Senators vote on amendments and acts that would improve the rights of LGBTQ Americans. From this rating, it is clear how little concern Sessions has for protecting the rights of a huge segment of the American population. Now that he is in charge of deciding much of what is considered “right,” it will be frightening to see how Sessions will manipulate his power to continue to oppose the LGBTQ community. His controversial stances on race also presage the coming difficulties American minorities will face. Sessions has commented that he thought the KKK was okay until he heard they smoked marijuana, and he has been accused of Racism Is Now In Session(s)calling a black assistant attorney “boy” and telling the man to be careful how he talks to “white folks.” He has also been alleged to have called the NAACP “un-American.” Although he denies the latter claims and says that his KKK comment was a joke, the simple abundance of the swirling controversies that follow Sessions should be sufficient to make a rationally-minded American uncomfortable. How does it make sense to have someone who has been reproached for so many racial remarks at the head of the organization that determines what justice is in this country? A man who has already been denied a federal judgeship and who possesses a history filled with such rampant racial insensitivity can only steer America back to the path of discriminatory voter laws. This bodes negatively for the south, where many minority citizens already deal with laws that make it difficult for them to register to vote. This pushes America backwards and threatens the existence of democracy itself. If  Sessions is able to push his agenda across and prevent many minorities from voting, who knows if there will be enough people who prioritize equality that are able to vote to prevent an authoritarian from winning his second term in office?No Check, No BalanceIsn’t it the worst feeling to get the mail from your mailbox at home and see that envelope with those three words that can ruin your entire day: “official juror summons?” No one likes to go to jury duty, but the courts are a necessary part of life in a democracy and most of us can recognize that fact, even as we bemoan our civic duty. Most of us, that is, except our president. As the country struggles through this rather long adjustment period to the new presidency, it is becoming increasingly clear that the new leader of our nation is a big fan of executive power. He has issued 12 executive orders in the first three weeks that he has held office. What the president is having more trouble with—and what should be the most concerning—is the complete lack of regard he has shown for the judicial branch.Trump’s most publicized executive order was his immigration ban, blocking citizens from seven Muslim majority countries from entering the U.S., as well as halting the refugee program. There has been a serious outcry against this ban, and while those protestors are right to be angry, Trump’s response to the backlash and the subsequent judicial reviews is possibly even more concerning than the order itself.Trump’s administration has shown serious disrespect and even disdain for the United States’ court system. Trump has questioned the authority of a federal judge who ruled against his travel ban as well as belittled the power that the court has over his actions and decisions. Trump may think that winning the presidency means obtaining absolute power over the entire country, but that is not how the government ever has or hopefully ever will function.Last Thursday, a federal appeals panel denied Trump’s bid to reinstate his travel ban after a federal judge blocked parts of it. According to The New York Times, the decision stated that Trump did have the power to create such executive orders, but he could not claim that “national security concerns are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections.” The courts reaffirmed their right to check presidential power and settle problems of constitutionality.The Founding Fathers lived under a government that did not listen to them and a single monarch with a great deal of power. They created a three-branch government with a system of checks and balances to avoid the very thing that Trump seems to want. Without these checks, there can be no balance. An unbalanced government is not a government that will help its people, but it might actually hurt its people if it does not follow the rules that have been set down for it.Without the judiciary, the government would have a single ruler with no checks. Without the judiciary, the United States would not be the democracy for which our founders fought so dearly. Without the judiciary, and especially with a Republican Congress, the role of the president would look a whole lot like a dictatorship.After the rejection of his ban, the president tweeted, “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” and for one of the few times in his campaign or presidency, he was actually right. The courts will and must continue to question and check Trump’s executive orders and actions, because if they do not, the safety of the entire country truly will be at stake.by Taylor Godfrey ’19Asst.

Lady Gaga’s individuality is admirable. Her confidence shines on the stage, and she serves as a positive role model for all of her fans.Unfortunately, the responses to Gaga’s performance were extremely pessimistic, and not for the reasons one would expect. People loved her show, saying it may have even been one of the best halftime shows of all time. So if people were not shaming her performance, then what bad things did they have to say? It’s called  body shaming.Tweets following her performance said things such as, “Gaga needs to do some crunches if she wants to show her flabby belly,” and “Tried to enjoy Gaga’s performance, was distracted by the flab on her stomach swinging around.” Tweets, like these, came from individuals hidden behind their computer screens.Gaga performed incredibly and looked beautiful during her show. The standards put on women to be stick-thin have gone too far. What people are calling fat is actually called skin, and we need it to survive. Without it, we would all be skeletal zombies.The pressure put on women to fit into a size two is outright disappointing.  According to the Multi-Service Eating Disorders Association (MEDA), approximately 20 percent of college women suffer or have suffered from some form of an eating disorder. Why do girls who weigh 135 pounds fear that they are “fat” and get nervous after eating one slice of pizza?Society has created an unrealistic body image for females. Insecurities and nerves run rampant when people are not comfortable in their own skin. So what should we take away from this distasteful after-effect of Gaga’s performance?In response to these disrespectful tweets, Gaga said,“I heard my body is a topic of conversation so I wanted to say, I’m proud of my body and you should be proud of yours too.” Her pride and confidence in her own body is one of the many reasons she is such a role model. Gaga is happy in her own skin and encourages everyone to be proud of his or her own body. She advises, “Be you and be relentlessly you.”We are all unique. We are all different shapes and sizes. It is our differences that define each and every one of us. If we were all the same size as Victoria Secret models, then there would be no individuality. It is not only extremely unrealistic and impossible for all women to be Barbie-sized, but it would also make for a boring world.Let’s embrace our differences. Stand tall and be proud of our bodies. No one has the right to put you down. You are beautiful, and you should never let anyone tell you otherwise.Trump Looks To Trim FDA by Kelsey Dass ’18Opinion StaffSOCIETYAs Americans watch the evening news during dinnertime, they may be paying more attention to the headlines than what is on their own plates. However, the Trump administration has as much of an effect on the food we eat as it does on foreign policy. Therefore, it is time we turn our focus to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The FDA exists on a large scale; its responsibilities range from making sure that pharmaceutical drugs to dietary supplements to vaccines are safe. In relation to foods, its job is to protect and promote public health through the control and supervision of food safety.When shopping in groceries stores, we often scan the aisles and feel at ease when picking up a product that is stamped “FDA approved.” The belief is ingrained in our minds that the FDA is our protection against foods that are not up to standard. Sounds good enough, right?The problem lies in the standard. Our general standards for food set in place by the FDA are already lower than those in European countries. The EU recently passed more regulations on food, requiring an updated “food labeling rule.” They now ensure that customers receive accurate and clear information on food content in order for European citizens to make informed choices on what they purchase.This all may seem very simple—the food in America is labeled too. Yet, to what degree? In 64 countries, including in the EU, there are restrictions and bans on genetically modified products or “GMOs.” The United States does not require the labeling of these types of products. Much of the food put in supermarkets contains GMOs, has come in contact with pesticides, and is pumped with hormones, yet is still labeled as FDA approved. It is concerning that Americans are putting their trust in this federal administration, empowered by the United States Congress, when it appears that they are not doing enough work to keep us safe. One would hope that with the new presidency, regulations on food would increase. Following the “Make America Great Again” campaign, should bettering the country not involve making the food safer as well? by Allison LaBelle ’20Opinion StaffSOCIETYPHOTO COURTESY OF JASON REED / REUTERSLADY GAGA PERFORMS AT THE SUPERBOWL LI HALFTIME SHOW ON FEB 5.Unfortunately, President Trump is doing just the opposite by lowering the regulations on food even more than they are now. One of the specific regulations planned to be eliminated is The FDA Food Police, which dictates how the federal government expects farmers to produce fruits and vegetables and even dictate the nutritional content of dog food. The rules govern the soil farmers use, farm and food production hygiene, food packaging, food temperature, and even what fields animals may roam and when. They also have greatly increased inspections of food facilities and levied new taxes to pay for this inspection overkill.  The FDA creates its standards based on a person telling them what the standards should be. The FDA is not God, and cannot protect us. They listen to their leaders; they do what they are told. Their job title may read “to protect and promote public health,” yet to the degree they do so is completely up to the government. Our government is now run by a person who does not have a moral obligation to ensure the safety of our foods. Did people think about this factor when casting their vote? Did they think about raising children in a world where the food they purchased is masked by a blanket of dishonesty?Illness will rise once people begin ingesting more foods covered in pesticides, and the people of this country will realize that “FDA approved” no longer means anything. OPINION The Cowl 11February 16, 2017The newsroom never sleeps. The newsroom never stops thinking of ways to stay on top because once the newsroom stops, everything stops with it. During the 82 years of The Cowl’s newsroom, we’ve made steady strides to match the pace of changing times. This week, we’re proud to unveil a new piece of The Cowl’s history: a redesigned logo, the invention of a newsroom that never sleeps. When the Dalmatian was introduced as the mascot of the College in 1935, he became a beloved member of our Friar Family for 66 years from 1935-2001. Sixteen years later, the dog has found his way back into our hearts as the College’s second mascot, and now as a part of The Cowl’s new logo. by Katherine Puzycki ’17 and Jacquelyn Kelley ’17 Editor-in-Chief and  Associate Editor-in-Chief EDITOR’S COLUMNThis goes in tandem with the tradition of the Dominicans, who, at their start, came to be known as the “watchdogs of the Lord”—Domini canes, in Latin. It is said that when St. Dominic’s mother was pregnant with him, she had visions of a dog carrying a torch. After the foundation of the Order, the black and white dog was depicted in church artwork and the Dominicans later adopted its colors. The Dalmatian on the front page was adapted from a previous PC illustration and sketched by Portfolio Editor Joey Aiello ’17, with the old tradition of the College in mind. It also features the original typeface The Cowl used during its early years of publication. Additionally, he will answer to the name of Huxley, a nod to the new Friar Athletics’ mascot whose name was officially announced on Feb. 15. The Cowl now has its very own watchdog—a protector of the news. Tangents TiradesPublisher: Kristine GoodwinCo-Publisher: Dr. Steven A. SearsAdvisor: Richard F.

They are the hidden heroes who come through for us every day and take care of the little things that we tend not to  think about. Their work usually goes unnoticed or underappreciated,but that does not mean we should treat it as such. Contrary to popular belief, it isn’t too difficult to use the right sink to wash dishes in, and it isn’t any harder to avoid leaving food residue in that sink. It is not as though we are incapable of abstaining from spitting toothpaste everywhere, and we certainly have the capability to throw food away in the trash, which surprisingly is where overwhelming consensus tells us it belongs—as opposed to, say, the floor, which for some reason seems to some to be more reasonable. We may just be human, prone to mistakes time and again, and we may just barely be on the brink of adulthood and complete independence, but it isn’t too much to ask that we be respectful, not just of each other but of the people who spend so much of their time making our home away from home a better place to live.-Hannah Paxton ’19The past couple of weeks I have noticed a recurring pattern in my life. On a typical weeknight I happily collapse in my bed around 11 or 11:30 p.m. and immediately grab my iPhone or iPad and start mindlessly scrolling. After getting my nightly fill of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, I turn out the light and try to fall asleep—but that often doesn’t happen for another 30-45 minutes. The next morning I feel even more tired, reluctant to roll out of my bed and venture outside to class. It has dawned on me that maybe my screen time at bedtime is messing with the quality of my sleep. And honestly, I take sleep very seriously, so this was a distressing realization. It turns out that the negative side effects of staring at a screen before you hit the sack are the real deal. Studies show that the light emitted from phones and tablets actually decreases levels of melatonin, a sleep-promoting hormone, in your brain and can make you feel as if you’re hungover the next day. A good night’s sleep is too precious—and important for our health—for us to waste it by spending another hour or so on our phones. So for the sake of all things good in the world, sleep being one of them, don’t take your phone into bed with you.-Carolyn Walsh ’17Huxley: Where Tradition Meets Transition GRAPHIC DESIGN BY JOEY AIELLO ‘17/THE COWLBlind with rage, I screamed as I took my pathetic ice scraper to the mountain of snow and ice that buried my car. I frightened several people in the process, including the person I was supposed to pick up at the train station. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to free my VW bug the day after the snow day—but the sunny day five days later was a different story. Clearing away the snow from all of the paths and parking spaces is a large job, especially when the snow refuses to stop falling. Even though the main roads within the Glay and Fennell parking lots were plowed, the parking spaces themselves were untouched, leaving all the students who pay for parking and lot maintenance marooned in misery. Although plowing individual spaces or removing snow from cars is not feasible, there has to be a better system than individual students swearing with scrapers. Those responsible for parking lot maintenance should be paid to make sure that the lot is actually maintained. It also took several days to clear the walkways on campus, leaving students slipping and sliding on ice in order to simply go to class. Meanwhile the public schools in the area were cancelled for the day. Oh, and I almost ran over someone with my car after I finally scraped away enough snow to floor it out of the parking lot, my tires slipping on the ice, making the unplowed lot and pathways a safety issue as well. After five days without snow, safety should be guaranteed and not a request. Just ask my car. -Brianna Abbott ’17ADVERTISEMENT12 The Cowl February 16, 2017Got Something to Say?Send Letters to the editor to commentary@thecowl.comInterested in joining The Cowl?Apply to the section of your choice online at www.thecowl.com/joinPHOTO COURTESY OF WWW.STOCKPICTURES.IOSee Your Ad Here!Email our Managing Editor at cowlads@providence.eduPage 13February 16, 2017Photography               Photos Compiled by Nicholas Crenshaw ’20, Photo EditorABOVE: Emily Smith ’20 and Laura Chadbourne ’20 celebrate Valentine’s Day at Crazy in Lové, an event featuring desserts, crafts, and Beyoncé-themed trivia, sponsored by BOP.

PHOTO COURTESY OF THEDAILYFREEPRESS.COMEntertainmentArts&Always Welcome to Singby Blaine Payer ’18A&E StaffMUSICIt seems like everyone knows at least one song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Their unique-brand of funk-rock has been captivating audiences for years, and after their sold-out show at TD Garden last Wednesday, it is easy to see why they are still so popular. The band can captivate a crowd like no other, but mostly with their older material from masterpiece albums like Californication. Their two most recent albums, including last year’s highly anticipated The Getaway, were poorly received and remain fairly absent from live performances. With each of the three original members well into their fifties, 2009’s controversial change in personnel, and no noteworthy material since 2006, many are beginning to speculate about the future of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and wonder if their best days are behind them. Although many people will identify themselves as Chili Peppers fans, not many know the extensive and troubled history of the often controversial group. Since their formation in 1983, the Los Angeles-based band has put out 11 full length albums, have been nominated for 16 Grammys (and have won six), sold 80 million records worldwide, and are credited with producing 13 number one radio singles. Those numbers place them at an echelon high above nearly every other band in the history of rock and roll. They are also well-known for their onstage gimmicks, including playing shows while wearing nothing but tube socks covering certain parts of their anatomy. Amidst their success and popularity, the band has also dealt with the death of founding members, a trying period of drug addiction (and subsequent recovery), and several lineup changes starting from their early days all the way up to 2009, when guitarist John Frusciante left the group to pursue a solo career. The departure sent shockwaves through the music industry, since Frusciante was a key component in creating the Chili Peppers’ signature and beloved sound, and was integral to their international success. The two albums released since Frusciante’s sudden leave of absence have become the bands two most poorly received albums since 1991’s masterpiece Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Many attribute the change in sound to the replacement guitar player, Josh Klinghoffer, while others predict that the band is simply past its prime. Their onstage success, on the other hand, has yet to skip a beat. The Rock and Roll Hall of Famers played a nearly two-hour set to 19,000 adoring fans full of favorites like “Otherside” and “By the Way,” as well as some throwback tracks like their cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Higher Ground” from their 1989 album Mother’s Milk. A striking feature of the show (other than the crazy light setup) was that they only played five of the songs off of their new album. It is never a good sign when only five out of eighteen songs are from the album that the tour is actually in support of. Of course, with a career that spans more than 30 years and has produced 11 albums, it is difficult to decide on a good survey of songs to include in a single show. The energy level of each member is also reminiscent of the height of their career in the 90s and early 2000s. Anthony Keidis was his usual hyperactive self, jumping around the stage like a wild animal and losing his shirt for the high-intensity closer, “Give It Away.” Bassist Flea was also as wild as ever, engaging the audience in witty (and very odd) banter and re-entering the stage for the encore while doing a handstand. While their new material may not live up to their former glory, Keidis recently assured his fans in an Alternative Nation interview that he will be writing music until the day he dies, leaving the possibility of future success hopeful. Regardless of the success or failure of their new material, it seems unlikely that the Red Hot Chili Peppers will ever stop knocking the audience’s socks off, though we certainly hope that they keep theirs on. Numerous alumni, across a broad range of graduation years, were welcomed to perform with their former groups. With just a few hours of practice that morning, they not only learned several songs, but some also took solos. The groups performed both classic and modern hits, such as “Stand by Me” and “Uptown Funk,” and through them connected an entire venue of Friars past and present.Ralph Tavares ’01, the current assistant dean of undergraduate studies and a former member of Special Guest, worked on inviting former A cappella members. When asked if many alumni were interested in coming back, Tavares said, “Everybody was crazy about it.” He said the group chat he created “spiraled out of control” and created “social media frenzy.” Tavares attributes this raving reaction to the strong communal spirit in the A cappella groups.Since its founding, PC’s A cappella Club has frequently welcomed alumni to perform alongside current members. According to Matthew Maurano ’06, former member of Special Guest, coming back to perform has become a kind of tradition. “Alumni Weekend was always something to look forward to,” said Maurano, “Alumni would always come back and sing…it was always a lot of fun.” Due to the tradition, members in A cappella groups have had the opportunity to meet and bond with alumni across a range of ages. “[Tavares] didn’t even go here when I did, he graduated before I was a freshman,” said Maurano, “But I still got to meet and know him through A cappella.” For current Anaclastic member Colleen L’Etoile ’17, meeting former members was a promising glimpse into the future. “To see all these past members come back, people with jobs and families, it was just nice to see they still have that passion for A cappella,” said L’Etoile, “I hope I have that.” After graduating, there are plenty of reasons to visit PC. Alumni come back for good company, to reminisce on old times, and even to share about their experience beyond campus walls. Members of the A cappella Club come back for all these reasons and more; back at PC, they can share their passion with a number of others, and perhaps pretend they never left.

SCHABEN/LOS ANGELES TIMESAdele poses with her trophies at The Grammy Awards.by Kerry Torpey ’19A&E StaffTELEVISIONAsk any literature lovers about the relationship between Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and you will hear about the tumultuous nights of drinking, partying, and adultery. Amazon’s new series, Z: The Beginning of Everything, attempts to capture the inception of the legendary couple with a specific spotlight on Scott’s muse, Zelda Sayre.The recently released Amazon series, created by Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin, is based on the historical fiction novel, Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald by Therese Anne Fowler. Dubbed the “first American flapper” by her husband, Zelda Sayre was born in Montgomery, Alabama in 1900. In July 1918, she met future American novelist and writer of The Great Gatsby, Francis Scott Fitzgerald. The two became engaged in 1920, and the rest is history. Zelda is played by Golden Globe and Emmy nominee, Christina Ricci and Fitzgerald is played by David Hoflin.The pilot episode begins with a shot of a fluffy pink heel in the midst of what looks to be the remnants of a fire. With Zelda as the narrator, the viewer sees right from the start that Zelda’s story will not be a happy one, despite the juxtaposition of her colorful and jazzy lifestyle.Whispers in the streets and calls from men all over Montgomery emphasize Zelda as not only a sought-after figure but a criticized one. Her stern father, Judge Anthony Sayre (David Strathairn), proves to be an antagonist for Zelda as his more traditional views and expectations clash with her unapologetic attitude, which makes her “[want] to go someplace shiny and new that’s not obsessed with the past.”Amongst many critics, Ricci’s performance as Zelda seems to be one of the few redeeming factors about the series. Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire.com  says, “Ricci commits to the role like it’s the role of a lifetime, and honestly, that might be the case. It’s certainly not hard to imagine her scoring a few nominations for this performance.” Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe states, “Zelda wanted to break away from society’s expectations, and so Ricci plays defiance with a capital D.” However, he does feel that Ricci “looks a little too old to play Zelda as a teen.” Critics like Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times cited a lack of chemistry between Ricci and Hoflin as a major issue within the series. Genzlinger says the co-stars, “are entirely devoid of the thing that the real Fitzgeralds apparently had in abundance: chemistry. Without any sign of a romantic spark, it is not clear why they would endure one another and stay together.”Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire.com also commended the high production budget, saying that it made the “period elements,” as in the 1920s costume, makeup, and set design, impressive with “seemingly no detail” spared. Despite some harsh criticism, there is a light at the end of the tunnel for Z. Jen Chaney of Vulture expects the show to go on and feels that Zelda “deserves to have her story fully told with the kind of detail that episodic television is uniquely equipped to provide.” by Elizabeth Jancsy ’18A&E StaffMUSICAdele Won, Beyoncé DeservedThe biggest names in Hollywood and music packed the Staples Center Sunday night for the 59th year of The Grammy Awards. The show featured a variety of performances and a number of winners. However, it was clear there were truly only two contenders Sunday night: Adele and Beyoncé. After a groundbreaking year for both female artists, as Adele and Beyoncé went head-to-head in four categories Sunday night. They were both up for for the coveted award of Album of the Year. Adele released her album 25 on November 20, 2015, featuring her hit single of the album, “Hello.” The album was a massive success ,following that of her second studio album 21, which eventually became certified diamond and sold over 10 million copies in the US. Beyoncé released her album Lemonade, along with a full visual album on April 23, 2016. In typical Beyoncé fashion, she released not only the recorded tracks but also a full music video to accompany each song, following in the style of her 2013 self-titled album. With hits such as “Formation” and “Hold Up,” Lemonade sold over 1.52 million copies in the U.S. Receiving such high praise for both pieces of work, it can be hard to judge which album is worth the most recognition from music’s most prestigious awards ceremony. It seems The Grammy’s didn’t have a hard time deciding, as it became evident as the night progressed that Adele would snag each category away from Beyoncé. Both women were nominated for Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Pop Solo Performance. Adele won every category and many people were not happy about it. Beyoncé is no stranger to losing the Album of the Year title, as she lost it against Beck in 2013 with her previous album. But after taking the loss again this year, many fans are questioning where the respect is that Beyoncé deserves. Following the biggest upset of the night, The Rolling Stone released an article with an opinion on why Adele won Album of the Year over Beyoncé. They suggested reasons such as presentation becasue Adele released her album the old fashion way in a standard and non-downloadable way, while Beyonce streamed her music off the music site Tidal. This relates to another suggestion that the Grammy voters are simply old and therefore are less connected to the powerful and culturally significant tracks Beyoncé put out, compared to the timeless messages of Adele. They also suggest it may have come down to facetime. Adele and Beyoncé both went on tour this past year to promote their albums, with Adele playing over 107 shows, as opposed tto Beyonce’s 49. Nobody can say for sure the reasons why Adele was able to pull the win over the Lemonade movement; not even Adele wasn’t sure how she beat ‘Queen Bey’. “But I can’t possibly accept this award. And I’m very humbled and I’m very grateful and gracious.The artist of my life is Beyoncé. And this album to me, the Lemonade album, is just so monumental. Beyoncé, it’s so monumental. And so well thought out, and so beautiful and soul-baring and we all got to see another side to you that you don’t always let us see. And we appreciate that. And all us artists here adore you. You are our light,” said Adele as she accepted Album of the Year. It cannot be an easy task to decide between two of the greatest albums this generation has been exposed to, but there has been widespread agreement that Adele’s win was Beyoncé‘s win. Adele dedicated her win to Beyoncé, and even broke off a piece of the award for her.

PHOTO COURTESY OF IMBD.COMA plastic toy and former hitman are not exactly how you imagine heroes—well, unless you are in Hollywood. Lego Batman and John Wick: Chapter 2 have essentially rescued the legacy of sequels and spin-offs, the Hollywood customs of continuation that have often suffered scrutiny for making bland and unoriginal films. Both Lego Batman and John Wick: Chapter 2 defy the stigma of film continuations, receiving rave reviews from fans and critics alike. According to Rotten Tomatoes, Lego Batman has a 91 percent  fresh rating, with John Wick: Chapter 2 following closely behind with 90 percent. The numbers, however, only point to the more poignant impact in these films: showing how to make a successful sequel. Lego Batman’s superpower is its originality. It adds a substantial amount to The Lego Movie, demonstrating a cleverness and creativity as it does so. All Lego Batman takes from its predecessor is the character and concept of Lego Batman with the amusing art style of the Lego universe. Everything else about the film was original or at least based off of Batman’s impressive and well-known history. What the Lego Batman movie does so well is combine the premise of the Lego universe with the deep mythos and landscape of Batman’s world. Lego Gotham City is both accurate to other adaptations of the character and adorably constructed from Lego bricks. The film also brings the same heart, wit, and humor that made The Lego Movie rise above commercialism towards praise and accolades. Described in The Rolling Stone as “action-movie fireworks,” John Wick: Chapter 2’s greatest strength is its explosive violence. There is nothing Netflix Gives Another ‘Reason Why’ to WatchA lot has happened in President Trump’s first 100 days; executive orders and protests seem to dominate the news reel every day. One unprecedented change, however, is the surging popularity of Saturday Night Live (SNL). With Alec Baldwin playing President Trump and Melissa McCarthy as the White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, satirical impersonations of the new administration have propelled Saturday Night Live to its most popular season in over 20 years. Since the beginning of this season, SNL has averaged a viewership of 10.64 million, numbers the show has not achieved since 1994. This past Saturday’s episode recorded 10.8 million viewers, which was its most watched episode since January  8, 2011. One of the most impressive feats this season is SNL’s rating among adults under 50. Including DVR replays, this season’s ratings are up 20 percent from last season—a statistic that starkly counters the notion the show is failing. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Political Analyst Larry Sabato said SNL’s recent success can be explained through its role as an outlet. “People who hate Trump need to gather together,” he said. “Sometimes it’s in the streets and sometimes it’s watching a show like ‘Saturday Night Live.’” Unlike angry Facebook posts or Tweets, Sabato says outlets like the sketch-comedy show are “a kind of Pepto-Bismol for the bile that’s building all week long.”SNL, the 1975 brain child of Lorne Michaels, is no stranger to the political scene. It has proven to be popular around the water cooler every Monday morning since its founding, especially during election seasons. The show has even been credited with the “Saturday Night Effect,” the electoral influence attributed to the show’s political coverage. This influence became even more evident in the 2008 election when SNL heavily satirized the then Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Due to Tina Fey’s impression of Palin, “I can see Russia from my house” was widely attributed to the VP candidate even though she never said it. The current season seems to be just as impactful, having even caught the attention of President Trump himself. In reaction to portrayals of himself and his administration, the President has recurrently tweeted severe criticisms of the show. President Trump has called SNL “really bad television,” “not funny,” and Baldwin’s impersonation of him “unwatchable.” For some, the heavy political satire in this season of SNL exemplifies its comedic genius, whereas others think the show is picking low hanging fruit. Regardless of how the satire is received, however, one thing is indisputable: it’s working.bland about this adrenaline-inducing sequel, which defeats common expectations attributed to similar franchises. In fact, John Wick: Chapter 2 goes so far as to outstrip the original John Wick, which only received a score of 85 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics attribute this increased success to the sequel’s ability to dazzle audiences with creatively choreographed fight sequences. These sequences, which revamp the strong points of the film’s predecessor, give fans what they have come back for—but with an exciting twist. Although it would be easy to basically remake John Wick, this sequel only builds on the strengths of the original and reinvents the rest. When creating sequels and spin-offs, there is always the temptation to justs recreate the original and live through past success.  That is what many expect to see in continuations, and exactly what Lego Batman and John Wick: Chapter 2 did not do. Critics and fans agree that this is what sets these films apart and makes them heroic.

PHOTO COURTESY OF INDIEWIRE.COMPHOTO COURTESY OF IMBD.COMby Brigid Walshe ’19A&E StaffNetflix Gives Another ‘Reason Why’ to WatchTELEVISIONAfter the immediate success of some of its original series, such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, Netflix has put more focus—and money—into producing their own original shows. In 2017 alone, Netflix is planning on spending $6 billion on 20 new original series, one being 13 Reasons Why, based on the young adult novel Thirteen Reasons Why written by Jay Asher. The novel is centered on the suicide of Hannah Baker and the reasons behind it. Hannah leaves behind cassette tapes, each centered on an individual who played a role in her death. She leaves Clay, who had a crush on her, in charge of the cassettes, and Clay pieces together the mystery of her death throughout the novel. Of course, the subject of this novel is very dark and mature for a young adult book, yet it discussed topics of life and death that are difficult for young adults to talk about and more importantly, gives a prime example of how treatment of others impacts their lives. The book has been given numerous awards and accolades, including a spot on The New York Times Best Sellers list and it was named one of the “Best Books for Young Adults” in 2008. More importantly, the novel has made a direct impact on fans reading it. Author Jay Asher has said that he receives many reader emails and is thrilled that this book has made a difference in so many lives. Therefore, after such a success, it was only a matter of time until the book would be adapted to the screen. Universal Pictures originally bought the rights for the film back in 2011, and cast Selena Gomez as Hannah, the main character. The movie was put on standstill until 2015, when Netflix announced its plan to make it into a miniseries, with Selena Gomez signing on to be the executive producer. Gomez, who took some time off from the industry for physical and mental health reasons, has stated that she is emotionally attached to the project, saying, “Kids have to see something that’s frightening, I want them to understand I definitely relate to everything.” Although the cast is mostly newcomers, the team behind the production is pretty impressive. The series is directed by Tom McCarthy, who was the director of the film Spotlight, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture at last year’s Oscars. The creator and writer of the series, Brian Yorkey, is both a Tony and Pulitzer Prize winner. Hopefully, behind the guidance of these professionals, the show can do the book and its message of justice. More importantly, this could add to the list of Netflix originals that have received critical acclaim. This is a big year for Netflix, and hopefully 13 Reasons Why can prove that Netflix’s shows will continue to impress audiences now and in the future.

Do I go with jeans or khakis? Are jeans too casual? And if I wear the khakis, do I go with the red shirt or the blue shirt? Definitely blue. Khakis with the red shirt makes me look like a sales associate at Verizon. But, then there’s the classic white shirt, dark jeans combo. Yes, that’s it, it’s casual yet classy. That’s what I’ll wear.I was extremely nervous to go on one of these dates. My friends had been pushing me to “get out there” for months, but I don’t really thrive “out there.” I like here. Nevertheless, they convinced me to sign up for a dating service, but Steve practically made my account. I don’t like half of the things he posted that I did, but he assured me it didn’t matter how honest my account was. I guess he was right because I got my first match and now I had to meet her.***I entered the restaurant she suggested. It was a dimly lit Asian fusion place. I saw a woman who appeared to resemble the flattering profile picture anxiously seared into my brain. I realized my staring had become prolonged and I began to get nervous. Should I wave? If it wasn't her, I’d likely be waving to someone else’s date or friend and I’d look like an idiot. Dating is not for the anxious. Suddenly she caught my gaze, smiled and waved, thus releasing me from the existential torment I was experiencing in the lobby of an Asian fusion bistro. I cordially reciprocated her wave and began my descent into terrifyingly uncharted waters: the table. As I approached the table I repeated the advice Steve had given me, which had since become a sort of panicked mantra, “What’s the worst thing that could happen?” I could think of lots of things I’d always say back to Steve.“Amber,” I squeaked timidly.“And you must be Brian!” “Guilty as charged!” my attempt at a corny joke, which I guess worked because she giggled.“So tell me about yourself, Brian.”Goddamn it. This. This was the worst thing that could happen.“Uh— I like movies and I work for a consulting firm.” And I’m a stock photo of a human male who also has hair, two eyes, and a nose. Way to go, Brian, sick response.“Believe it or not, I like movies too.”I laughed; she didn’t kill me over that terribly bland response.“So what do you do for work?” I asked.“I kill people, mostly,” she said so candidly it almost wasn’t funny.“Good one!” I laughed. “No, I’m serious. I kill people for money.”“Oh? Like bad people? For the government?”“Sometimes. Depends.”“On…”“Who’s hiring.”“So you’re a murderer?”“Woah, murderers are reckless and emotion-driven. They have no code or craft.”“So you’re a gun for hire then?”“We in the industry prefer ‘contractual assassin.’”“The industry?”There was a long awkward pause before Amber returned with, “So, mister movie guy, what was the last movie you saw?”“Oh! It’s uhh—It’s this one—well it’s in theaters now and it’s about this guy… who uhh… kills people… for money… and uhh… it was okay…”“You seem really hung up on my job.”“Well it’s just not every day that you—” “Okay, cards on the table, I’m here on a job, that’s why I suggested this restaurant.”Before this moment I couldn’t tell if this was a joke and she had just dragged out the bit for humor longer than she should have, but there was no question anymore. She was deadly serious. Also, I told Steve that dating site was bullshit.“So this isn’t even a real date?” Why this was my initial reaction to this is beyond me.“Look, Brian, my job comes first. You seem like a nice guy, though, and once this is all said and done I wouldn’t mind going on a real date with you!”“I’ll keep that in mind.”We ordered our dinner and continued our date. She spoke effortlessly and comfortably as if we were the best of friends. Meanwhile I was waiting for an exchange of gunfire every time she stopped talking for a moment. Suddenly her friendly demeanor disappeared and she motioned to the waiter for the check. “We need to go,” she stated. “I don’t know if I want to—”“You won’t,” she interrupted, “But you need to leave with me so I don’t arouse suspicion by getting up and hastily leaving my date at the table.”For whatever reason, I followed her lead. “Grab my arm,” she demanded. I took her by the arm as if she were my regular, boring, girlfriend rather than a murdere—contractual assassin.Outside the restaurant she broke free of my arm and began to lightly jog after a man trying to hail a cab, but not before stopping to turn around and say,“Oh, I almost forgot to say, I had a nice time! Call me!” She dashed off and down an alley adjacent to the restaurant. I began walking towards the subway station when my phone rang.“Hello,” I said.“How was your date, stud?” Steve’s obnoxious, drunken voice boomed out of the phone’s speaker.“It was—uhm, Steve I don’t think this dating stuff is for me.”“Come on, how bad could it have been, what’d she try to kill you?” he joked.CRACK. I nearly dropped my phone in terror. “Well, no.”PORTFOLIO February 16, 201722 The Cowl It’s not going so well, thanks for asking Honestly, I can only do so much multitasking.My résumé needs a lot of work, and don’t even ask about my cover letter I just keep going, silently willing things to get better.

Head Coach Bob Deraney became the winningest coach in Women’s Hockey East history with 154 league wins. On top of that, the Friars also held a ceremony to retire the jersey of number 21 Cammi Granato '93. Granato was the greatest women’s hockey player to ever lace up the skates for the Friars, playing from 1989-1993 and tallying a whopping 256 points (139 goals and 117 assists) in 99 games. She then went on to captain Team USA in the 1998 and 2002 Olympics (the first time women competed in Olympic hockey) and brought home gold and silver medals respectively. Granato was also the first woman to ever get inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2010.With just two games remaining in the regular season, the Friars are beginning to set their sights on the postseason. The team currently sits at fourth place in the Hockey East standings with a 10-9-3 conference record and a 15-14-3 overall record. Providence is situated at 16th place in the PairWise Rankings, a position that, if maintained, will enter them into the NCAA Tournament. It would be the first time since the 2004-2005 season that the program qualifies for the tournament. The Friars will play their last regular season series against the Boston College Eagles this upcoming weekend. The Eagles sit in first place in Hockey East and are number five in the PairWise Rankings. Saturday afternoon’s game will be held at 2 p.m. at Schneider Arena and will honor the program’s graduating seniors: goaltender Alanna Serviss ’17; defensemen Ariana Buxman Athlete of the Week: Anthony Florentino ’17by Meaghan Cahill ’20Sports StaffMEN'S HOCKEYLast weekend was a weekend of firsts for Providence College Men’s Ice Hockey player Anthony Florentino ’17. He scored his first ever career hat trick during the Friar's 5-3 win over Univeristy of Maine. When asked what that feeling must have been like, Florentino stated, “It’s cool to say I’ve finally scored a hat trick in my hockey career…15-17 years of playing and it’s my first one.\"  It was this that earned him his first Hockey East weekly nod as he was named Hockey East Defensive Player of the Week. Florentino is only the second Friar defenseman to score a hat trick throughout Hockey East this season and the seventh to do so in the past three seasons. Before the UMaine game, the last Friar to score a hat trick was Jake Walman ’18 on October 30, 2015 against Colgate. He was very humbled when speaking about this honor, giving all of the credit to his teammates. “Realistically, that wouldn’t have happened without my teammates. It came from the game I had a hat trick in, but if you look at the three goals it was all generated by forwards…they made everything happen.\" As a senior on the team, Florentino has quite the career under his belt, including a National Championship win and two appearances in Fenway Park’s “Frozen Fenway.” As a Boston native, Florentino said the past ’17, Arianna Reed ’17, Kendra Goodrich ’17, and Lauren Klein ’17; and forward Cassidy Carels ’17.Carels leads the team in scoring with 18 goals and 14 assists to make up 32 points, a career high for the forward. Throughout her 136 games in the Friars uniform, Carels has amassed 48 goals and 55 assists to give her a total of 103 points so far.With Carels leading the offense, the Friars will look to players like Whitney Dove ’20, Kate Friesen ’19, and Rachel Rockwell ’20 to lead by Lauren Altmeyer ’17Sports StaffWOMEN’S ICE HOCKEYWomen's Ice Hockey: Playoff Aspirationsexperience of playing in America’s beloved ballpark, even though the game resulted in a loss, was “awesome.” It was also a game that held meaning for him as a player, “My brother’s boot camp went out for the Coast Guard, and it was the last game he saw me play, as a Friar, so it was a pretty special experience being at Fenway.” With this being his last season as a Friar, Florentino is setting his goals high and expecting nothing less than perfection as the season enters its final four games before the Hockey East tournament. When questioned about his goals for his final season, there was no hesitation in his voice, as he quickly stated, “I want another National Championship.” He went on to say, “Obviously that’s the ultimate goal. Gotta win Hockey East first though. End result for my senior year: going out on top.” He does not want the Championship just for himself but “for the school, the team, the city even.” Florentino was on the team that won that National Championship in 2015 against Boston University, a memory that he says is his favorite as a Friar. Reflecting back on the game, Florentino says, “That team was pretty special...[winning] was an amazing experience.”Florentino, who was drafted during the fifth round of the NHL Draft by the Buffalo Sabres in 2013, has no regrets when it comes to his career at Providence College. “Not a thing,” was his answer when asked if there was anything he would have done differently, “Best three years of my life so far.\" However, the season is not over yet. Ranked fifth overall in Hockey East and 10th overall in the country with a nine game win streak, the men’s hockey team will have back-to-back away games against Notre Dame (ranked third in Hockey East and 15th in the country) Feb. 17-18 before they come back to Massachusetts  to face off with UMass Amherst at Amherst on Feb. 24. The Friars will conclude their regular season in Schneider Arena on Feb. 25 against UMass Amherst. “Focus on the games we have to play,” Florentino states, regarding what needs to be worked on going into the final few games and the tournament. “We started off pretty slow, a little up and down, but lately we’ve been putting it all together, a five-man effort out there. The younger guys are stepping up and everyone is coming together as one and playing a complete game.”When asked if he had any last words he would like to say before the interview concluded, Florentino acknowledged the fans who have always supported the team and with a big smile said, “Go Friars!”SPORTS The Cowl 27February 26, 2017As nervous as I am to say this, I believe this is finally the year that the Washington Capitals will bring home the coveted Stanley Cup trophy. The Capitals are undoubtedly the hottest team in the NHL right now, leading the entire league with a record of 39-11-6, including an incredible mark of 18-3 since the start of the new year. Center Nicklas Backstrom has been sensational and is currently tied for second in the NHL in points with 60. Braden Holtby has also elevated his game this year, and is second in the NHL with a 2.02 GAA, and a record of 29-8-4. But perhaps the biggest The Minnesota Wild are currently sitting at the top of the Western Conference standings with a record of 37-13-6 (7-2-1 in their last 10 games), hoping to continue their momentum and capture the franchise’s first Stanley Cup. The Wild possess excellent veteran leadership, a plethora of scoring talent, and a hot goaltender which concocts their recipe for success. Captain Mikko Koivu has emerged as one of the league's best leaders, as well as his co-leaders, assistant captains Ryan Suter and Zach Parise. Eric Staal, who captained the 2006 Carolina Hurricanes to a Stanley Cup,  has proved Minnesota WildWashington Capitalsreason why I am so confident in the Capitals to win it all this year lies in three-time Hart Trophy winner Alex Ovechkin.  Ovechkin is having another incredible year, already recording 26 goals to go along with 25 assists, for a total of 51 points.  Since Ovechkin entered the league in 2004, the Capitals have been to the playoffs eight times and won their respective division six times. However, despite the division titles and playoff appearances in the past 13 years, the Capitals have never advanced past the second round since Ovechkin has been there, leading many to criticize the star ’s clutch factor. I believe Ovechkin is on a mission to prove his doubters wrong this year and will put the team on his back in the postseason. Ultimately, it will be up to him to get Washington to bring home their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. by Max Anderson ’19Sports StaffOP-EDto be a key off-season acquisition to provide additional veteran leadership. Comprising the majority of the offensive talent are Parise and 24-year-old offensive weapons Charlie Coyle, Nino Niederreiter, and Mikael Granlund.Goaltender Devan Dubnyk is currently leading all NHL goaltenders in both wins and save percentage. Goaltending is essential for a deep playoff run, and with the way Dubnyk has been performing this season, he has proven to be tough to beat. With their recent disappointment in playoff appearances and performance, the Wild have a chance to finally click this post-season. Minnesota stands atop the highly competitive Central Division that includes Mid-West powerhouses Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues. With a deep and talented roster, along with great success thus far, the Minnesota Wild are making a name for themselves in the Stanley Cup conversation.by Sam Scanlon ’19Sports StaffOP-EDWho will win the Stanley Cup?PHOTO COURTESY OFLOGODATABASE.COMView from the crowd during the game against Butler.After a heartbreaking loss to the Villanova Wildcats at a jam-packed Dunkin’ Donuts Center on Feb. 1, the Providence College Men’s Basketball Team fell to 14-10 overall and 4-7 in the Big East, a very disappointing drop from their 10-3 mark in nonconference play. After three straight seasons of  making the NCAA tournament, the Friar men will need a great run in order to go dancing again during March Madness in 2017.After a week off, the Friars flew to Newark to challenge the Seton Hall Pirates, a team they had previously beaten at home. PC enjoyed an early 17-2 run and sprinted out to a 27-12 lead. However, the hosts quickly clawed their way back to a 41-36 deficit at halftime. Throughout the duration of the game, the Friars looked in control, leading for 26 minutes. However, the Pirates just would not back down and finally took the lead with a minute left. Trailing 60-59, Rodney Bullock ’18RS hit a jumper to put his team out in front with 43 seconds left. Seton Hall knocked down a free throw to tie it, and Kyron Cartwright ’18 could not get a shot off before the clock ran out. In overtime, the Friars took an early lead, but the Pirates fought their way back and put the game away on a layup with nine seconds remaining to win 72-70. Providence returned to the Dunkin’ Donuts Center on Saturday, February 11, for the annual Alumni & Family Weekend matchup against the No. 22 Butler Bulldogs. With 12,746 students, alumni, families, and prospective students and parents in attendance, the game started off very slowly. Only 20 points were scored in the first 12 minutes, and Butler led by a slim 25-23 margin at the half. During the break, the school honored two program greats by raising their jerseys to the rafters: the late Bruce “Soup” Campbell ’78, who was was represented by his family, and Otis Thorpe ’84, a former All-Star and NBA champion after PC, who walked out to loud cheers. In a contrast to the Seton Hall game, the Friars trailed for 27 of 40 minutes, keeping it close, but never feeling secure. Butler raced out to a 47-41 lead, but Cartwright directed a 9-2 run and hit a three to take a 50-49 lead with 7:25 minutes left. Alpha Diallo ’20 stepped up for the hosts, scoring 15 points and making a bid for SportsCenter’s Top 10 Plays with a ferocious dunk off of a missed free throw. Emmitt Holt ’18 scored from under the basket to take a 65-60 lead with 39 seconds left, and later dunked with authority to cap off a strong 71-65 win for the Friars. Saturday marked PC’s second victory against a by Jeff Williams ’17Sports StaffHOCKEY Men’s Basketball Defeats No. 22 Butlerranked opponent this season; the first was over No. 21 University of Rhode Island on Dec. 3. While the Seton Hall loss was devastating, the Butler win represents Providence’s first signature win. With another win against Xavier under their belt, the Friars appear to be rolling. The only four games that remain are, home games against Marquette and DePaul, and away games versus Creighton and St. John’s. The Friars may need to win each of them (or at least go -1) to get back into the tournament conversation. It will be tough, as they are 1-4 against those teams this season, but given recent history, no one should ever doubt a team coached by Ed Cooley.NICHOLAS CRENSHAW'20/THECOWLPHOTO COURTESY OFLOGODATABASE.COMto be a color analyst for a New York Knicks game, the first woman to be an analyst for a Big East men’s game, and the first woman to be the primary analyst on a men’s college basketball conference package. Her sideline reporting on professional men’s and women’s basketball has earned her innumerable praises (including becoming Drake’s woman crush every day). Burke’s number 11 was retired for women’s basketball.When asked what being honored by Providence College and having her number retired meant to her, Burke explained, “I had such an amazing time at Providence, it truly has part of my heart. I carry PC with me everywhere. I was provided with an education I could not have otherwise afforded. I could cry just thinking about how much it means to me.” Burke certainly grasped that opportunity and took it to its full advantage.Basketball was not the only sport that had legends visiting. Both men’s and women’s hockey retired numbers—including Lou Lamoriello ’63 and Ron Wilson ’77 for the men’s team and Cammi Granato ’93 for women’s. Lamoriello was honored as both a player and a coach for PC. During his time as coach of the hockey team, he led the 1982-1983 team to a national best record of 33-10-0, bringing the Friars to the Frozen Four that year—their first since 1964. After his tenure as coach, he served as PC’s athletic director and was integral in getting together the Hockey East Association, which the hockey team is still part of today. Lamoriello's effort to bring PC to the forefront of college hockey did not stop there. As Athletic Director, he negotiated the first TV package in college hockey history. This helped put PC hockey on the map and solidify its spot as a top hockey program. Beyond Providence College, Lamoriello also became the first commissioner of the Hockey East, and as a result, had the Hockey East championship trophy named after him. After his stint in collegiate hockey, Lamoriello made the jump to the NHL, serving 28 years as the New Jersey Devils GM and President of Hockey Operations. During this time, the Devils won nine division championships, five conference championships, and three Stanley cups, a truly SPORTS28 The Cowl February 16, 2017Honoring Friar Athletic LegendsWhen Men’s Basketball Head Coach Ed Cooley was asked about what this tradition of greatness means to him and this program, he said, “It’s all about the Friar Family, that’s what this is celebrating. It creates a tradition that is long lasting and truly special for everyone here.” It was clear by the tremendous attendance of not only the games where the jersey retirements occurred, but also at the event itself held at the Omni Hotel, that alumni and Friars alike agreed.  Another basketball legend who was honored was Doris Burke ’87. She was a standout player while at Providence, playing point guard and ranking second in all-time assists. But this was just the beginning for Burke in sports. Burke has gone on to be a trailblazer for women in the sports analyst business. She was the first woman impressive run. Lamoriello is definitely one of the all-time greats to ever come through the halls of PC.  Number four, Wilson’s number, was retired in Schneider Arena along with Lamoriello’s on Feb. 10. Wilson is another Friar great who not only excelled during his time at PC, but long afterwards as well. Even though he was a defenseman, Wilson excelled offensively during his four years, scoring over 16 goals and 38 points in each of his years here. His peak year was his sophomore year, where he made an astounding 87 points for the Friars in only 27 games. His hockey career did not end there, as he played for a few different teams professionally both in the United States and in Switzerland. His most notable achievement, however, came long after his playing career ended in 1988. Leading the United States national team in both the 1998 and 2010 Winter Olympics, Wilson brought the team to the finals before losing to Canada in a devastating overtime loss, which resulted in a silver medal. There is no doubt that Wilson was deserving of being memorialized with the retirement of his number. Lastly, and certainly not least, Cammi Granato ’93’s number 21 was retired. Granato could be considered one of the best women’s hockey players of all time. Her stats during her tenure at PC are absolutely astounding. She had 24 goals and 22 assists her freshman year, and 26 goals and 20 assists her sophomore year. But it was her junior and senior year that she truly shined. In her junior year, she had 48 goals and 32 assists for a total of 80 points. She followed this with her best season ever as a hockey player. In the 1992-1993 season, Granato had 41 goals and 43 assists for 84 points in 28 games—an average of about 3.07 points per game. To compare, Haley Wickenheiser, considered one of the greatest women's hockey players, had a storied career that included time in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) league, comparable to U.S. college hockey. In her 68 games there, she averaged 1.97 points per game. Clearly, Granato’s season was truly something special. Like the rest of these Friar legends, her story did not end when she walked across the stage. With the U.S. National Team, she was named the Women’s Player of the Year in 1996. Only two years later, she helped the team win gold. Granato was the first U.S. woman’s player to score an Olympic goal and remains the United States’ all-time leading scorer. But perhaps what best encapsulates Granato’s career, is what happened in 2008. It was announced that year that Granato, along with 2 other women, would become the first women to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Granato was undoubtedly more than deserving to be honored this weekend with her jersey retirement.With all these legends present, the Friar athletics did not disappoint. They won the weekend at home, with men’s hockey beating UConn in a thrilling 4-3 win and men’s basketball pulling off the upset of the season, beating No. 22 Butler 71-65. It seemed that having all that star power inspired our athletes to strive to become legends themselves. But as all the athletes honored showed, to become part of the Friar tradition, excellence continues beyond just Providence College.Father Shanley ’80 and Coach Cooley present Burke her retired number.The honored athletes and their relatives holding the plaques dedicated to their retired numbers.NICHOLAS CRENSHAW'20/THECOWLContinued from front page InductionsNICHOLAS CRENSHAW '20/THECOWL",
