In 2017, the Trans Sistas ofColor Project-Detroit (TSoCP) launched a emer-gency assistance program, which consists of an un-conditional grant, up to $500, for transgenderwomen of color. TSoCP’s emergency assistance pro-gram provides immediate funds to transgenderwomen to address economic insecurity. During theCOVID-19 pandemic, TSoCP and other transgender-1Department of Health Behavior and Health Education, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.2Trans Sistas of Color Project, Detroit, Michigan, USA.3Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.4Department of Pediatrics, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan, USA.5Department of Applied Health Sciences, Indiana University School of Public Health, Bloomington, Indiana, USA.*Address correspondence to: Kristi E.

Microeconomic interventions reduce HIV riskin low- and middle-income countries and have been re-cently assessed for feasibility in U.S. settings.12 How-ever, transgender persons have largely been omittedfrom microeconomic interventions.13 Therefore, weconducted an initial pilot evaluation of TSoCP’s emer-gency assistance program to understand strengths,challenges, and areas for improvement.MethodsProceduresThese data were collected as part of a community-academic partnership called the Love Her Collective.The Love Her Collective began in 2018 through a col-laboration between University of Michigan andTSoCP.14 The Love Her Collective has conductedfocus groups, in-depth interviews, and survey researchto better understand and address the needs of transgen-der women of color in Detroit.8,14,15In November 2020, the Love Her Collective re-ceived funding to provide emergency assistance totransgender women of color due to the COVID-19pandemic in Detroit and to evaluate TSoCP’s emer-gency assistance program. The grant was designedto allocate $7,000 directly to TSoCP to use as partof their existing emergency assistance program and$1,300 to be used for the evaluation of the emergencyassistance program.Between November 2020 and March 2021, TSoCPprovided emergency assistance to 30 transgenderwomen of color in Detroit through this grant. TSoCP’semergency assistance program has a strong reputationin the community and is designed to provide all trans-gender women of color with emergency assistancewithout requiring paperwork.15Consistent with TSoCP’s existing programming, in-terested individuals reached out to TSoCP throughtext, e-mail, or social media to request emergency assis-tance. TSoCP processed payments through a mobilebanking app (i.e., Cash App). Those who requestedfunds were then invited to participate in the pilot eval-uation. TSoCP explained the purpose of the evaluationand informed individuals that their decision to partic-ipate would not have any impact on receiving funds.TSoCP sent them a survey that included the consentform, baseline survey, and asked for their contact infor-mation for follow-up. The pilot evaluation included aself-administered baseline survey (before grant receipt)and a 1-month follow-up survey (after grant receipt),which each took 5–10 min.At baseline, participants were asked their age,race/ethnicity, gender identity, monthly income, andhow often participants did not have safe place to sleepat night in the past month with response options rangingfrom ‘‘Never’’ to ‘‘Always’’ on a 5-point Likert scale. Bothbaseline and follow-up surveys inquired about strengthsand challenges of the program with write-in responses.At baseline, participants were asked to describe the fund-ing application process with response options rangingfrom ‘‘very easy’’ to ‘‘very difficult’’ on a 5-point Likertscale. At follow-up, they were asked the same questionregarding receiving the funds. The follow-up surveyalso asked how participants used program-providedfunds with check-all responses (e.g., housing, food, healthcare, or medications).Participants received a $50 gift card for completingeach survey ($100 total). The study was deemed ex-empt by the University of Michigan InstitutionalReview Board.ParticipantsEight transgender women who received emergency as-sistance agreed to participate in the evaluation. Partic-ipants ranged in age from 23 to 50 years (mean[M] = 33, standard deviation = 9). All participants iden-tified as a Black transgender woman. At baseline, themajority (87.5%, n = 7) reported that they had earnedless than $1,000 in the past month (i.e., 30 days). In ad-dition, half (50%, n = 4) ‘‘sometimes’’ or ‘‘always’’ wor-ried about having a safe place to sleep for the night overthe past month.Data analysisDescriptive analyses (e.g., frequencies and means) wereconducted to examine participant characteristics, easeof requesting and receiving funds, amount received,and how funds were used. A thematic analytic ap-proach was used for open-ended responses in the base-line and follow-up survey.16 The first and secondauthor first familiarized themselves with the open-ended responses. Next, these authors devised a the-matic framework for coding by reading the data and196 GAMAREL ET AL.Downloaded by 165.225.59.49 from www.liebertpub.com at 06/28/23. For personal use only. then inductively identifying and creating codes foremergent themes. They discussed and refined the the-matic framework, separately applied these final codesto the data, wrote analytic memos (i.e., more detailednotes) about the identified themes, and resolved dis-agreements through conversations.ResultsMost respondents completed both baseline and 1-month follow-up surveys (87.5%, n = 7). At baselineand follow-up, participants described requesting andreceiving emergency funds as ‘‘neither easy nordifficult’’ ‘‘somewhat easy,’’ and ‘‘extremely easy’’(M = 4.75 and M = 4.50, respectively, on a 5-pointscale). All participants reported that COVID-19 af-fected their need for emergency assistance. Participantsreceived $100 to $500 (M = $200). Funds were used topay bills (62.5%), buy food (62.5%), pay rent or forshelter (50%), or pay for medications (12.5%), house-hold necessities such as toilet paper (12.5%), gender af-firmation products (12.5%), or school (12.5%).We next present qualitative findings from the write-in responses that were categorized into perceived ben-efits, concerns, and improvement areas. The mainthemes identified based on our thematic analyseswithin each category are italicized.Perceived benefitsParticipants described being satisfied with the effi-ciency of the process of requesting and receiving emer-gency funds. Participants highlighted the quickresponse and minimal screening procedures as condu-cive to receiving urgent support. Funds distributionwas described as seamless and professional (e.g.,‘‘never have to wait,’’ ‘‘always get answers/responsesquickly,’’ ‘‘it was so easy receiving the funds, I didn’thave to wait a long time,’’ and ‘‘simply professional’’).Others noted that the program provided a sense ofcommunity where participants did not feel alone dur-ing the pandemic. For example, participants noted‘‘they have made this pandemic not feel so hard,’’ andthat the best part was ‘‘reaching out and gettinghelp,’’ and ‘‘reaching out and knowing someonewould respond and truly help.’’ Participants alsonoted that the program helped build community bycontributing to safety and survival (‘‘Keeping us safeand alive,’’ ‘‘Because when in need they help as muchas they can and it shows they care’’) and contributedto community empowerment (‘‘All of my great Blacktrans sisters, wanted to help other Black trans sisters,’’‘‘it’s a connection of sisterhood and the process isword of mouth’’).Perceived concernsSeveral participants (46.5%) reported no program-related concerns. However, at baseline, three partici-pants (37.5%) noted challenges in asking for help. Spe-cifically, participants felt shame around experiencingfood insecurity, not being able to pay a bill, or findinga safe place to sleep. One participant stated ‘‘I thinkpride is the hardest part’’ when asked about difficultiesin requesting emergency assistance.Two participants at baseline (n = 25%) and four par-ticipants at follow-up (50%) noted they were nervousabout potential delays or ineligibility since there are alack of other sources of financial support if assistanceis delayed or if the requestor is deemed ineligible. Forexample, one participant at baseline reported, ‘‘Iguess the hardest part would be if you can’t receive ser-vices then there’s no other place for you to be able tocall to get help being a trans woman, especially ifyou’re banned from organizations that usually helpyou then you’re kind of just left in the wind.’’Similarly, the hardest part about the process for an-other participant was, ‘‘Thinking that I wouldn’t get areply asking for help especially being transgenderwoman of color.’’ One participant also noted that a po-tential concern is that some people of color in theircommunities, including trans people who are not out,were excluded from the program: ‘‘The only qualifieris that you MUST be a transgender woman. It’s hardbecause you don’t want others from the communitytaking advantage when someone has more need.’’Areas to strengthenParticipants were also asked what other services shouldbe included in a program to help transgender womenof color improve their financial security. At the baselineand follow-up, participants noted the importance ofaugmenting emergency assistance with other neededservices, which included access to legal gender affirma-tion, safe housing, viable employment, and financial lit-eracy (e.g., establishing good credit). For example, oneparticipant stated, ‘‘I believe we should have more pro-grams for housing and more jobs that are trans-friendlyand help people with the name change and help cleanup their criminal record.’’Two participants noted the importance of gainingskills in financial literacy, money management, andCOMMUNITY-LED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 197Downloaded by 165.225.59.49 from www.liebertpub.com at 06/28/23. For personal use only. establishing good credit: ‘‘Financial literacy!! Thebenefits of having good credit and low to nonedebt ratio.’’DiscussionReceiving funding for emergency assistance allowedTSoCP to distribute critical resources to meet the essen-tial survival needs of their communities that would haveotherwise gone unmet during the COVID-19 pandemic.In this pilot evaluation, we found emergency assistanceprovided transgender women with resources to surviveand connect with their community. Recipients wereable to avoid getting behind on their rent, obtain emer-gency shelter, avoid food insecurity, access medications,and continue education during the 1-month evaluationperiod. Our pilot program evaluation provided key in-sights into aspects of the program that are workingwell and some areas for improvement.TSoCP’s emergency assistance program was de-scribed as an efficient model that provided a sense ofcommunity for Black transgender women who havebeen continuously forced into dispossession due to sys-temic racism and transphobia.4 Participants describedthe importance of incorporating access to legal genderaffirmation and other microeconomic interventioncomponents into TSoCP programming. For example,a promising U.S.-based microeconomic interventionwith Black cisgender young adults includes micro-grants toward income generation paired with educa-tional workshops and mentorship on financial andcareer planning.12Thus, a multicomponent intervention in future stud-ies could build upon TSoCP’s emergency assistanceprogram and include microeconomic componentssuch as microgrants, group workshops, and mentor-ship on economic empowerment. In addition, wehope to develop a medical-legal partnership to providelegal gender affirmation and assistance with other legalissues combined with emergency assistance in Detroitusing rigorous evaluation procedures.17Despite the potential promise of TSoCP’s emergencyassistance program, it is important to note that leadersin transgender-led organizations are not exempt fromthis same systemic oppression yet continue to heal theconsequences for their communities. Our findings un-derscore the importance of investing in and providingadequate resources to transgender-led organizations toserve as the blueprint for effective community-led inter-ventions to dismantle intersectional oppression and re-sultant inequities.11LimitationsParticipants were recruited when they were requestingemergency funds. Individuals were informed that re-ceiving emergency assistance was not contingent onparticipating in the evaluation. It is plausible that non-respondents were in crisis and did not have the time orability to complete surveys. Individuals were told thatTSoCP members would not see their responses orknow whether they participated; however, transgenderwomen in Detroit are a close-knit community; thosewho did not participate may have had concernsabout confidentiality. The use of a survey to gatherqualitative data minimized participant burden but didnot allow us to capture rich narratives. Finally, thiswas a small group of participants who agreed to partic-ipate in the evaluation; therefore, larger studies arewarranted to more rigorously evaluate emergency as-sistance programs.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic and visibility of violence di-rected at transgender women of color has brought intofurther focus the intersectional injustices plaguingsociety.2 Our study highlights the importance ofcommunity-led strategies to alleviate the negative se-quelae of racism and transphobia experienced by trans-gender women of color. Public health research,programming, and policy must acknowledge these in-justices and position transgender women of color asleaders in forging solutions.DisclaimerThe content is solely the responsibility of the authorsand does not necessarily represent official views ofGroundswell Fund.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to all of the study participants,the Trans Sistas of Color Project board members andother transgender-led organizations who remained onthe front line of the COVID-19 pandemic connectingtheir communities to emergency assistance, deliveringcare packages, and providing critical social support.We are indebted to our Program Officer, Bré Rivera,for her vision and tireless work to ensure black transjoy and liberation.Author Disclosure StatementNo competing financial interests exist.198 GAMAREL ET AL.Downloaded by 165.225.59.49 from www.liebertpub.com at 06/28/23.
