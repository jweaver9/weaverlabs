While a framework of LGBTQ youth social support and \nnonsupport exists (e.g., Kiperman, Varjas, Meyers, & Howard, 2014), findings were exploratory and \ndemonstrated limited generalizability. A transformative framework indicates research should include \nLGBTQ youth without parent consent in addition to those with consent, as they have limited \nrepresentation in literature.  \n            Chapter one is a systematic review of counseling/psychotherapy interventions practices with \nLGBTQ youth overtime. Inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded a full review of n = 15 studies from N = \n3,025 sources. Some reviewed variables include: recruitment methods, consent procedures, treatment \ntype, design/measurement, and outcomes.  Results identified (n = 2) studies that practiced behavior \nmodification in the 1970’s and 1990’s, while studies meeting current ethical treatment types (e.g., \n \n \naffirmative, culture specific, strength based) (n = 8), occurred from the 2000’s to present day. Few studies \nidentified consent procedures (n = 4). This chapter is among the first to explore characteristics of \ncounseling/psychotherapy for LGBTQ youth chronologically. \nChapter two’s qualitative analysis explored whether LGBTQ youth experiences confirmed and/or \ndisconfirmed an existing model of LGBTQ youth social support/nonsupport types (Kiperman et al., \n2014). A total of (N = 42) LGBTQ youth with (n = 21) and without (n = 21) parent consent were \ninterviewed. Unique contributions included replacing Kiperman et al.’s (2014) \nconcepts, support and nonsupport types with support and nonsupport actions (what support/nonsupport \nwas enacted) and descriptions (traits or mannerisms of a provided support/nonsupport or person). \nFindings compared experiences of youth with and without parent consent. Samples discussed social \nsupport and nonsupport similarly, permitting use of the same codebook across samples. More youth with \nparent consent endorsed experiencing appraisal, tangible/instrumental, and informational social support \nactions compared to youth without parent consent; however more youth without parent consent \nendorsed emotional social support actions. Social nonsupport descriptions codes were endorsed with \ngreater frequency by youth without parent consent or equally among both samples.  Implications inform \nhow support/nonsupport actions and descriptions may interact. Analyses of sample differences validated \nthe need to include LGBTQ youth without parent consent in research. \n\t\nINDEX WORDS: LGBTQ youth, Social support, Nonsupport, Psychotherapy, Counseling, \nTransformative framework, In loco parentis, Parent consent  \n \n \nEXPLORING A MODEL OF SOCIAL SUPPORT AND NONSUPPORT AMONG  \nLGBTQ YOUTH WITH AND WITHOUT PARENT CONSENT \nby \nSarah Elizabeth Kiperman \n \nA Dissertation \n \nPresented in Partial Fulfillment of Requirements for the \nDegree of \nDoctor of Philosophy \nin \nSchool Psychology \nin \nDepartment of Counseling and Psychological Services \nin \nthe College of Education and Human Development \nGeorgia State University \n \n \n \nAtlanta, GA \n2017 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \nSarah E.

A Systematic Review of Counseling and Psychotherapy Provisions for Lesbian, Gay, \nBisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ) Youth: A Chronological \nAnalysis \nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ) youth often experience \nmarginalization via bullying (Button, O’Connell, & Gealt, 2012), teasing (Espelage, Aragon, \nBirkett, & Koenig, 2008), harassment (D’Augelli & Patterson, 2001), and negative school \nclimate (Kosciw, Greytak, Bartkiewicz, Boesen, & Palmer, 2012). LGBTQ youth also encounter \nstressors such as negotiating their identity development and coming out (Varjas, Kiperman, & \nMeyers, 2016). It has been reported that perceived discrimination among LGBTQ youth can \naccount for increased depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and self-harm compared to \nHeterosexual, non-transgendered youth (Almeida, Johnson, Corliss, Molnar, & Azrael, 2009). \nWhile many LGBTQ youth have access to supportive relationships and lead fulfilling lives \n(Kiperman, Varjas, Meyers, Howard, 2014; Munoz-Plaza, Quinn, & Rounds, 2002), it is \nimportant these youth have access to effective counseling and psychotherapy, which may impact \ntheir susceptibility to mental health concerns.  \nThe American Psychological Association (APA, 2016) defines psychotherapy as \n“…collaborative treatment based on the relationship between an individual and a psychologist. A \npsychologist provides a supportive environment that allows you to talk openly with someone \nwho is objective, neutral and nonjudgmental, [… where goals aim to] help people of all ages live \nhappier, healthier and more productive lives”.  Counseling is defined by APA (2016) as a service \nthat helps people with physical, emotional and mental health issues alleviate feelings of distress \nand resolve crises while improving their sense of well‐being.  The American Counseling \nAssociation (ACA, 2016) added that counseling involves a professional relationship that \n2 \n \nempowers diverse people to achieve mental health, wellness, education and career aspirations. \nCounseling and psychotherapy are the mental health services practiced within the American \nPsychological Association (2016) and will be the focus of discussion in this chapter.  \nIt is important that mental health professionals treating LGBTQ youth practice \ncompetent, ethical, and beneficial counseling and psychotherapy (American Psychological \nAssociation, 2009; DeLeon, 1998). Professionals can inform their practice by reviewing \ndocumented examples (e.g., research articles, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses) of \ncounseling and psychotherapy with LGBTQ youth. Mental health professionals should also be \ninformed about issues in counseling and psychotherapy that are particularly relevant to LGBTQ \nyouth clients such as consent procedures. LGBTQ youth may be harmed if they prematurely \ndisclose their sexual orientation/gender identity to their parents by the requirement that parents \nsign forms to consent for their child receiving counseling or psychotherapy. Learning about \nconsent procedures and options can inform practitioners how to ethically engage LGBTQ youth \nin counseling and psychotherapy practice and research. Furthermore, a historical review of \npsychotherapy and counseling implementation with LGBTQ youth could inform how context \nmay greatly inform service provision. The current study seeks to review counseling and \npsychotherapy practices enacted with LGBTQ youth, how these youth are recruited and can \nconsent, and how these practices have contextually occurred.  To address these aims, the \nremainder of this introduction reviews of three areas: (1) prior systematic reviews on counseling \nand psychotherapy with LGBTQ youth, (2) consent procedure practice with LGBTQ youth, and \n(3) historical perspectives on counseling and psychotherapy with LGBTQ youth community.  \n3 \n \nSystematic Reviews of LGBTQ Populations and the Provision of Counseling and \nPsychotherapy \nVarious systematic reviews have explored aspects of counseling and psychotherapy for \nLGBTQ adults (e.g., Byrd & Nicolosi, 2002; King, Semlyen, Killaspy, Nazareth, & Osborn, \n2007; Serovichet al., 2008; Woodward & Willoughby, 2014); however, Woodward and \nWilloughby (2014) conducted the only study to convey findings relevant to LGBTQ youth. \nSpecifically, counseling and psychotherapy treatment recommendations for practicing family \ntherapy with LGB youth were made and included: using psychoeducation to inform parents of \ntheir child’s coming out, meeting the child client’s needs, being culturally sensitive and \naccepting, promoting family cohesion and acceptance, fostering new, affirming traditions, \nincluding family members in therapy, and assessing the their ability to communicate and handle \ncrises.  \nKing and colleagues (2007) systematic review explored counseling and psychotherapy \nprovisions with LGBT adults. While the King et al. (2007) had a table reviewing sample \ncharacteristics, recruitment techniques, sample sizes, definitions of sexual orientation and gender \nidentities of participants, the type of counseling/therapy, study outcomes of interest, and \nprevalence/findings section. Key findings from this review found “gay affirmative” therapies to \nbe common, where gay affirmative therapy refers to “therapists regard[ing] LGBT lifestyles \npositively, were knowledgeable and non-prejudiced about LGBT issues and provided therapy \nthat did not pathologies minority sexual identities” (King et al., 2007, P. 8).  Studies rarely \nindicated how these practices were implemented or how they adjusted their curriculum to meet \nthe cultural needs of LGBT clients.  \n4 \n \nWhile Woodward and Willoughby (2014) review recommendations for therapy with \nLGB youth and King et al (2007) review counseling and psychotherapy practices with LGBTQ \nadults, there remains a dearth of research that reviews how counseling and psychotherapy have \nbeen implemented with LGBTQ youth. This chapter seeks to inform what counseling and \npsychotherapy methods/techniques have been implemented, as the King et al (2007) exclaims, \nhowever, this study seeks to understand these experiences with LGBTQ youth. \nRecruitment and Consent for Counseling and Psychotherapy \nAn ethical concern researchers and practitioners may confront with LGBTQ youth clients \nis how to recruit and provide counseling or psychotherapy for them when asking their parents for \nconsent may prematurely out them or bring them harm. Having effective recruitment methods for \nyouth without parent support is important as these youth may have limited access to resources \nand mental health support. Varjas et al. (2008) discuss the importance of innovative recruitment \ntechniques of LGBTQ youth for research, given that many have not come out. More distant, \nanonymous recruitment methods (e.g., posting in chat rooms) were discussed as potential \nrecruitment methods by Varjas et al. (2008) to promote youth’s willingness ad confidence to \ndiscuss their lives and identities. This study, however, calls for a closer examination of \nrecruitment strategies to inform efforts to include these youth in research. Expanding this \ndiscussion to counseling and psychotherapy practice could help provide youth with more \ninformation to access services they may need.  \nObtaining consent from a parent or guardian for youth under 18-years-old to participate \nin counseling or psychotherapy is typically a mandatory practice, however, the federal mandate \n45 CFR 46.408(c) now allows for researchers to waive traditional consent and use in loco \nparentis procedures instead.  In loco parentis procedures are designed to protect the rights of \n5 \n \nminors where an accepting adult figure, independent of the counseling or psychotherapy study is \ninformed of a youths’ involvement in lieu of their parent (e.g., Varjas et al., 2008). Currently, \nthere is a dearth of research that has systematically reviewed consent practices for LGBTQ youth \nin research or counseling and psychotherapy. This review explores whether consent and \nrecruitment methods are discussed differently for research compared with counseling and \npsychotherapy; as well as identifies current practices used in research on counseling and \npsychotherapy practice with LGBTQ youth.  \nThe History of LGBTQ in the context of Counseling and Psychotherapy Provisions \nLaSala (2013) documented that the psychology community has been transitioning from a \nfrom an agenda that blames LGB youth towards a more supportive agenda. A ‘blaming’ agenda \nhas referred to problems as exiting within the child, such as the American Psychiatric \nAssociation’s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) considering homosexuality a \ndisorder until 1973. The blaming agenda has also referred to counseling and psychotherapy’s \npractice of attempting “to ‘cure’[ing] Homosexuals by transforming them into Heterosexuals” \n(e.g., conversion or reparative therapies) (Hicks, 1999; Serovich et al., 2008). In contrast, the \ntransition to a more supportive agenda has begun to emphasize treatments adopting an \naffirmative framework (that fosters acceptance), where LGBTQ youth clients are encouraged to \naccept and integrate their sexual orientation and gender identities into their sense of self and \nwhere families are included in the therapeutic process to learn how to affirm their child. Gender \nDysphoria persists as a classified disorder in the current DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Gender Dysphoria \nrefers to individuals’ experiencing clinically significant distress for at least six months due to not \nidentifying with the gender identity (male or female) others perceive them to be. The presence of \nGender Dysphoria in the DSM-5 may suggest a more progressive social agenda around sexual \n6 \n \norientation issues (e.g., removing ‘homosexuality’ from the DSM-5), compared to gender \nidentity, which has continued pathology.  \nTo illustrate the transition towards acceptance and away from blaming the LGBTQ youth \ncommunity, several organizations have actively sought to clarify their ethical stance against \nLGBTQ pathology.  Just the Facts Coalition stated their rejection of reparative therapy, that \nhomosexuality was not a mental disorder, and that a cure was not necessary (APA, 2009). The \nAmerican Psychological Association addressed reparative therapy with a Task Force on \nAppropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation statement that conveyed these \npractices yield ineffective and harmful results (APA, 2009). APA Task force on Appropriate \nResponses to Sexual Orientation (2009) published a resolution that opposed portrayals of LGB \npeople as mentally ill who seek treatment for their sexual orientation. APA’s (2009) official \nrejection of reparative therapy was necessary as previous practices (during the LGBTQ blaming \neras) had limited commentary as it was consistent with societal norms and expectations. The \nsocietal shift towards acceptance and away from blaming of the LGBTQ community deemed \nthese practices unethical and in dissonance with societal expectations- thus calling on APA’s \nneed to clarify their stance on counseling and psychotherapy (LaSala, 2013).  \nThis section depicts a historical perspective by pairing actions of APA with the social \ncontext in which they occurred. The historical (and ongoing) shift from blaming to acceptance of \nthe LGBTQ community could greatly relate to the counseling and psychotherapy experiences of \nLGBTQ youth, however limited research has explored these practices while accounting for the \nhistorical context in which they occurred. This chapter seeks to inform this gap by bringing \nattention to article content related to its publication year.   \n7 \n \nRationale for Study \nThe previous introduction indicates that there is a dearth in systematic reviews that \nevaluate the consent procedures, recruitment methods, measurement, outcomes, and \ncharacteristics of implemented counseling and psychotherapy with LGBTQ youth. In addition, \nthere has been limited documentation of historical issues in counseling and psychotherapy for \nLGBTQ youth. This chapter presents a systematic review of implemented counseling and \npsychotherapy with LGBTQ youth. This study seeks to address gaps in the literature by \nanswering the following research questions:  \n1. What counseling and psychotherapy practices documented in research have been \nimplemented with LGBT youth and how have they evolved over time? \n2. What recruitment and consent procedures have been used for investigations of counseling \nand psychotherapy when treating LGBTQ youth clients?  How have these practices \nchanged over time? \n3. How have studies that investigate counseling and psychotherapy with LGBTQ youths’ \ndescribed research designs and measurement strategies used.  How have these research \ndesigns and measurement strategies changed over time?  \n4. What counseling and psychology services were found to evoke significant change in \nLGBTQ youth, and how have reports of significant change evolved over time? \n5.  What recommendations were made to suggest how counseling and psychotherapy \nprovisions could yield the most effective experiences for LGBTQ youth clients? \n8 \n \nMethods \nPhases of the Systematic Review \nThis systematic review followed recommendations from the Preferred Reporting Items \nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines by Liberati and colleagues \n(2009).  These guidelines recommend conducting systematic reviews via a four phase process: \n(1) identification, (2) screening, (3) eligibility, and (4) included. The PRISMA methods were \nused to clearly depict how articles were systematically included in this study using this four-\nphase process, as shown in Figure 1.1.  \n9 \n \n \n10 \n \nIdentification. In the identification phase, researchers used web-based databases and search \nengines to identify sources to review.  First, Boolean search terms were entered into the \nEBSCOhost system to search the following databases: PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Medline, \nCINAHL, ERIC, LGBT Life, Social Work Abstracts, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences \nCollection. The first author modeled this search based on similar search techniques conducted by \nWoodward and Willoughby (2014). The remaining authors edited and agreed upon the search \nterms.  Three independent criteria (separated by “and”) were used in the Boolean search that \naddressed (1) sexual orientation and gender identity labels, (2) the youth population of interest, \nand (3) counseling and psychotherapy provisions. The Boolean search terms were: (LGBT OR \nHomosexual OR Gay OR Lesbian OR Bisexual OR Transgender OR \"sexual orientation\" OR \n\"sexual minority\" OR Queer OR YMSM OR YFSF OR MSM OR FSF) AND (Youth) AND \n(Psychoanalysis OR Treatment OR Counseling OR Therapy OR Psychotherapy). The search \nterms YMSM, YFSF, MSM, and FSF refer to “young men who have sex with men”, “young \nfemales who have sex with females”, “men who have sex with men”, and “females who have sex \nwith females” respectively. \nSecond, researchers used the web-based database Publish or Perish to identify sources \n(Harzing, 2010). In the Publish or Perish program, the researchers used two sets of search terms: \n(1) LGBT Youth AND Psychoanalysis, Treatment, Counseling, Therapy, Psychotherapy; (2) \nSexual Minority Youth AND Psychoanalysis, Treatment, Counseling, Therapy, Psychotherapy. \nThese terms were identified based on recommendations by Harzing (2010) for conducting search \nresults in Publish or Perish. After all of the articles were retrieved (N = 4,025), duplicate copies \nwere eliminated using endnote’s “find duplicate” feature, and then by importing all sources into \n11 \n \nexcel and reviewing similar sources by hand. Concluding this process, the total number of \nunique, merged sources produced was (n = 3,025) as indicated in Figure 1.1.  \nScreening: Setting limits; applying inclusion criteria. In the screening phase, \nresearchers began with the unique, merged sources identified in the identification process (n = \n3,025). Researchers eliminated sources by assessing whether information from abstracts met the \ninclusion criteria. The following inclusion criteria were developed by the research team. First, \nthe studies had to include one of the following methodologies: qualitative (methodologies such \nas interviews, open-ended questions, or formal qualitative methodologies such as \nphenomenology or narrative frameworks), quantitative (methodologies using statistical \nanalyses), or case studies (commentary by the narrating author/service provider). Both published \n(e.g., peer reviewed articles) and unpublished sources (e.g., theses and dissertations) were \nincluded. Second, the studies had to be written in English. Third, the studies had to implement \nand evaluate counseling or psychotherapy. Studies were viewed as implementing counseling and \npsychotherapy, when the words “therapy” “psychotherapy” “counseling” or “treatment” were \nused to describe the intervention, or when a therapy approach/technique is explicitly \nimplemented (e.g., cognitive-behavioral approach or desensitization techniques). Various terms \nwere included in the search (e.g., therapy, psychotherapy, counseling and treatment) to account \nfor sources that referred to counseling or psychotherapy by a different label (e.g., treatment or \nintervention).  Nevertheless, “treatment”, when referring to medical findings and not counseling \nor psychotherapy, was viewed as not relevant to this search. Implementation refers to \nparticipants actively receiving an intervention rather than proposing an intervention or treatment \nwithout active implementation. Fourth, studies had to describe the targeted population for change \nas LGBTQ youth. This inclusion criterion was not met when a study’s sample population \n12 \n \ncontained a normative culture sample (e.g., Heterosexual or Cisgender youth), when one or more \nparticipants were younger than 10 or older than 25, or when the target of change was family \nmembers of LGBTQ youth or others who were not the youth themselves. Fifth, studies had to \nidentify a behavior, emotion, or environmental concern being modified and/or addressed via \ntherapy for LGBTQ youth. Sixth, researchers had to conduct the study in the United States. This \ninclusion criterion was not met when studies conducted cross-national analyses, even when a \nrepresented culture was the United States.    \nThe researchers applied the inclusion criteria sequentially, using each criterion in the \nsame order to note whether an article met each criteria. The first time an article did not meet an \ninclusion criterion it was excluded, and further eligibility criteria were not explored. The \nresearcher documented which criterion item yielded each source ineligible in Figure 1.1, per \nmethodology recommendations of Liberati et al. (2009) . The higher criterion frequencies found \nin Figure 1.1 related more to their sequence in determining eligibility rather than the frequency \nof each criterion’s presence in each article. In the screening phase the first author found 37 \nsources met inclusion criteria and 2,988 were excluded. \nEligibility: Reviewing full text. For the eligibility phase, researchers reviewed the full \ntext of sources retained in the screening process. If researchers were unsure whether articles met \ninclusion criteria from the screening phase, they were retained. Whole texts were evaluated in the \neligibility phase with the same inclusion criteria as the screening phase since some criteria may \nnot have been included in the abstracts. Two researchers independently evaluated the 37 articles \nfor review.  They determined the criterion item, (from the screening phase) where each article \nwas no longer eligible. Researchers compared whether they indicated the same criterion for each \narticle to be excluded and also identified articles that did not meet exclusion criteria, and were \n13 \n \nregarded as included (Maggin, Johnson, Chafouleas, Ruberto, & Berggren, 2012). Their findings \nyielded a percent agreement index (Maggin et al., 2012), which depicted how well the \nresearchers matched in their coding and data analysis decision-making. Percentage agreement \nindices are calculated by dividing each unit of agreement by the total units upon which one can \nagree. In the eligibility phase’s percentage agreement index, a unit of agreement refers to \nresearchers identifying the same criteria at which an article is excluded or included. This index \naims to depict the authors’ ability to yield similar, reliable findings. The percentage agreement \nindex attained was 100% where there were 37 articles for researchers to match in their agreement \nof inclusion and exclusion criteria, and all 37 were agreed upon (Maggin et al., 2012).   \nInclusion: Included articles for review and analysis. The inclusion phase references \nthe total number of relevant sources that are included in the systematic review analyses. As \nindicated in Figure 1.1, a total of 15 sources met inclusion criteria, while 22 were excluded at \nthis phase.  \nData Coding  \nThe researchers conducted descriptive analyses to yield a detailed summary of findings \nfrom the 15 included articles, found in the appendix. The descriptive analyses present similar \ncategories as previous studies that have reviewed counseling and psychotherapy and LGBTQ \nculture (e.g., King et al., 2007; Liberati et al., 2009; Woodward & Willoughby, 2014). The \ncategories included in this chapter from previous studies include the following: Participant \nInformation, Population Label, Participant Recruitment, Consent Procedures, Treatment, \nTreatment Type, Treatment Beneficiaries, Targeted aspect of change, Treatment Goal, Sample-\nSpecific Goal, Research Design/Measurement, Outcomes, and Recommendations (King et al., \n2007; Woodward & Willoughby, 2014). The authors included additional categories they viewed \n14 \n \nas important in understanding the counseling and psychotherapy experiences of LGBTQ youth. \nThese categories include the following: Participant Recruitment, Consent Procedures, and \nTreatment Beneficiaries. The researchers used inductive coding within each category by \nreviewing the articles and generating codes that represented the included data (Nastasi, 2009). \nThe codes are depicted in chronological order in Table 1.3 while Table 1.4 depicts each code’s \nfrequency.  \nPublication year. Publication year, references the year each source was published. The \narticles are presented in chronological order in Table 1.3 (inductive-deductive coding) and Table \n1.6 (descriptive analysis).   \nParticipant information. The participant information category refers to how the study \ndescribed participants. Included in the participant information categories are Population Label, \nParticipant Age Range, and Sample Size.  \nPopulation label. The population label category refers to how the study labels the \nrecipients of treatment (e.g., LGBT youth). In Table 1.3 and Table 1.4, Population labels were \ncoded with the following codes: H = Homosexual, P = a pathological reference found in the \nDSM (e.g., Gender Identity Disorder, Gender Dysphoria), LGBTQ = When participants are \nreferenced with terms including Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, or Questioning, \nGN = Gender nonconforming, or MR = when Multiple labels were used (e.g., LGBT and \nethnicity). Note that “Homosexual” was not included within the “pathological” code because it \nwas removed from the DSM, but at one point was considered a pathological label (APA, 2013). \n15 \n \nParticipant age range. Participant age range was reported as the range in ages or school \ngrades (e.g., 8th grade) of the participants in the study. When age ranges were unspecified but \nstudies explicitly stated participants were high school aged, the code HS was applied. \nSample size. The sample size was reported as the total number of participants receiving \nan intervention in each study.  \nParticipant Recruitment.  Participant recruitment refers to how participants became \ninvolved in the study. Participant recruitment included the following codes: ITP = In prescribed \ntreatment (where the psychologist discussed a completed counseling or psychotherapy case \nwhere the client was placed in therapy by a parent or others), ITV = In treatment voluntarily \n(where the psychologist discussed a completed counseling or psychotherapy case where the \nclient was already seeing the clinician voluntarily or by their own choosing), CI = Convenience \nsample (where participants are located where the study is taking place, such as in school, but \nthey are not actively involved in therapy prior to the study’s implementation), CA = Commercial \nadvertisement (e.g., flyers, brochures, advertisements, commercials), and S = Snowballing (when \npeople in a study refer other people to participate in the same study).  \nConsent Procedures. Consent procedures refer to the consent practices used by each \nstudy. Consent procedures were analyzed via the following codes: IP = In Loco Parentis (youth \nadvocates, allies to the LGBTQ community sign a form in lieu of parent consent acknowledging \nadult awareness of participation), WC = Waived consent (parental consent not required and \nalternative procedures not specified), PC = Parental consent (parent/guardian consent required \nfor youth to participate), and NA = Not Addressed (consent procedures not discussed).  \n16 \n \nTreatment. The treatment category references characteristics of the overall treatment. \nIncluded in the Treatment category are Treatment Type and Beneficiaries.  \nTreatment type. The category, treatment type, refers to how the studies label the type and \nsubtypes of therapy, counseling or psychotherapy being provided. The codes are titled with the \nsame discourse used by the studies, but the researchers also operationalized each code to clarify \ntheir meaning. The treatment types were analyzed via the following codes Table 1.3 and Table \n1.4: BM= Behavior modification (altering behavioral patterns via techniques such as \nbiofeedback and positive/negative reinforcement), P= Psychoanalysis/Psychodynamic (therapy \ntechniques that call on interactions between the conscious and unconscious elements of the mind \nto evoke change), PE= Psychoeducational (inclusion of teaching components in treatment aimed \nat empowering clients and their families), C= Counseling (general, unspecified type), MI= \nMilieu (therapeutic community with whom clients receive therapy), ME= Medicinal (when \nmedicine was used as a part of treatment), A= Affirmative (promoting acceptance of self rather \nthan changing one’s identity to Heterosexual or Cisgender and not diminishing their  identity), \nSB= Strength based (promoting awareness and fostering of one’s strengths), CI= Culture \ninformed therapy (explicit modifications to treatment that make it culturally relevant to the \nclient) , QT= Queer theory informed therapy (discussing gender and sexual orientation as \nnormed social constructions), CC= Client centered (understanding and incorporating the client’s \nworld views, where they are actively involved in their treatment), CBT= Cognitive behavioral \ntherapy (specific therapy used to challenge negative thoughts of self and the world to alter \nunwanted behaviors and/or thoughts), TGS= True gender self-therapy (views gender \nnonconforming as healthy; encourages parents to ask kids about gender and to foster their \n17 \n \nidentity), AB= Attachment based family therapy (relies on attachment theory and enforces secure \nattachment style for parents with their child, grounded in trust and empathy). \nBeneficiaries. The category, beneficiaries, refers to which individuals or groups are \ntargets of the treatment. This category was not included in Table 1.6 as descriptive data since it \nwas combined within treatment goal. Beneficiaries were parsed out into its own category in \nTable 1.3 and Table 1.4. Researchers concluded that the Beneficiaries category was important \ninformation to include following their descriptive analysis that has not typically been presented \nin reviews on similar topics, so they developed inductive codes to explore this aspect of \ncounseling and psychotherapy.  In Table 1.3, these data were coded with the following codes: F= \nFamily Involvement (when any family members is involved in the treatment plan), S= School \nPeers Involvement (when any peers from the school community are involved in the treatment \nplan), C= Community Involvement (when any community involvement outside of school \nsettings are involved in the treatment plan), or AC= Adolescent client (when only the adolescent \nis involved in the treatment plan). \nTargeted aspects of change. The categories within targeted aspects of change refer to \nwhat the studies aim to change for the LGBTQ youth. These categories include Treatment Goals \nand Sample-Specific Goals. \nTreatment goals.  The treatment goals category refers to what the treatment aims to \nchange for the participant when it is implemented. Treatment goals was analyzed via the \nfollowing codes: M= Mainstream to culture norms (goals of assimilating the client to normative \nculture by addressing their nonconformity); AI= Affirm Identity (goals of fostering acceptance of \noneself in contrast to idealizing a Heterosexual or Cisgender ideal, not diminishing their \nidentity), MO= Modify Environment (goals of changing aspects within the environment to \n18 \n \nbenefit LGBTQ youth); PE= Psychoeducate (goals of instilling knowledge or skills through \nexplicitly stated psychoeducation), and O= Other (goals of treatment are unclear or not stated).  \nSample-specific goals. The sample-specific goals category refers to each article’s \ndescription of the symptomologies, diagnoses, cognitions, and/or behaviors unique to \nparticipants prior to and throughout treatment that would be addressed through therapy. The \nfollowing codes were used to depict the trends in sample-specific goals: EB= Effeminate \nbehaviors (goals of reducing traits that were considered more feminine by nature, in males), D= \nDrug Use (goals of eliminating or reducing drug and/or substance use), I= Internalizing concerns \n(goals of reducing the presence of internalizing concerns such as anxiety and depression), SE= \nSelf Esteem (goals of improving one’s self esteem or self-worth), S= Suicidal (goals of \neliminating suicidal ideation, enactments of suicide, or suicide attempts), US= Unsafe Sex \nBehaviors (goals of reducing unprotected sex and improving safe sex habits), IH= Internalized \nHomophobia/Heterosexism (goals of addressing biases and judgments related to homophobia \nand heterosexism), FC= Family concerns (goals of reducing family related stressors), RP= \nResilience Promotion (goals of increasing and strengthening one’s ability to cope with potential \nstressors), and DR= Dropout (goals of preventing youth leaving school before graduating). \nResearch Design/Measurement. The category, research design/measurement, refers to \neach assessment that was used to evaluate change in the LGBTQ youth (e.g., qualitative \ninterviewing, BASC social emotional measures). For inductive-deductive coding in Table 1.3 \nand Table 1.4, the codes for research design/measurement included: CS= Case study (a \ntherapist’s descriptive recount of individual cases), QUAL= Qualitative (using only qualitative \nmethodology or open ended answers), QUAN= Quantitative (using only quantitative \nmethodology or measures/scales to depict the results), and MM= Mixed methods (using a \n19 \n \ncombination of qualitative and quantitative methods for research design). Table 1.5a, 1.5b, and \n1.5c also pertains to the research design/measurement category, and depicts the scales used in \neach quantitative study along with the operationalized terms that the scale aims to quantify and \ndepict.  \nOutcomes. The outcomes category refers to the reported outcomes of the treatment. For \nthe inductive-deductive coding process, in Table 1.3 and Table 1.4, outcomes were analyzed \nwith the following codes: CH= Change noted (findings only indicated change), NCH= No \nchanges noted (findings only indicated no change), CH&NCH= a combined notation of changes \noutcomes (findings indicated a combination of detected change and no change in the client). \nRecommendations. The recommendations category indicates what each study explicitly \nendorses as a result of implementation of their intervention. The inductive-deductive coding \nincluded the following codes: B= Behavior change (using operationalization, reinforcement, and \npunishment to foster Heterosexual lifestyle/behaviors), Ed= Education (calling for cultivating \nknowledge of the LGBTQ youth and/or others), Prev= Prevention (recommending prevention \nefforts, e.g., for HIV via safe sex), CS= Culture Specific Framework (encouraging modifications \nof therapeutic methods originally intended for use with normative culture to ensure relevance for \nthe LGBTQ youth population), PP= Pop Culture (incorporating pop culture into therapy), PD= \nprofessional development (Urging therapists to seek professional development opportunities), \nR= Client/therapist relationship (Fostering and valuing the relationship between the client and \ntherapist), SB= Strength-Based (Calling for a focus on what is going right in someone’s life in \ntherapy), Eco= Ecological Involvement (Incorporating parents, schools, GSA’s etc. into therapy \nto promote a healthier environment for the LGBTQ youth), and CT= Continued therapy \n20 \n \n(encouraging practitioners to not discontinue therapy following one coming out or transitioning \nas ongoing stressors may persist following these major events). \nData Collection \n All included studies were imported and reviewed in an excel spreadsheet by a research \nteam member. The same author conducted screening, eligibility, and inclusion steps in the \nPRISMA eligibility process. The devised inclusion and exclusion criteria from the section, \nScreening: Setting limits; applying inclusion criteria in the methods, were used to eliminate and \ninclude sources in the screening, eligibility, and inclusion phases (Liberati et al., 2009). A \nresearcher developed the coding domains for the descriptive (Table 1.6) and coding analyses \n(Table 1.3) and reviewed them with the research team. Codes were reviewed by enacting the \npercentage agreement index. The researchers used an inter-rater reliability percent agreement \nindex (Maggin et al., 2012) that was described in the Eligibility: Reviewing full text section to \nconvey how well the coders agreed in each inductive-deductive coding domain. Percentage \nagreement indices were calculated for each code from Table 1.3, however indices were not \napplied to the open coding in Table 1.6. In the descriptive summary analyses (Table 1.6), \nresearchers collaborated on each article for the summary table to ensure code operationalization \naccuracy, and used methods to obtain consensus (collaborated discussion, until consensus \nreached) for all articles (Larsson, 1993). For results in Table 1.3, researchers independently \ncoded each article, compared their results to reach a percentage agreement index, and used \nconsensus coding to address codes where disagreements occurred (Larsson, 1993). As a result, \nall coding presented in this study depict 100% agreement via collaboration between raters. An \nupcoming section (Inductive-Deductive coding, Table 1.3) discusses the achieved inter-rater \nreliability percent agreement index for the inductive-deductive coding.  \n21 \n \nDescriptive Analysis, Table 1.6. In descriptive analysis, the research team \noperationalized the following categories: publication year, population label, participant age \nrange, sample size, treatment type, treatment beneficiaries, targeted aspect of change, treatment \ngoal, sample-specific goal, research design/measurement, outcomes, and recommendations. \nThese categories definitions are located within the data collection section of the methods. \nThe research team enacted an iterative coding process (Miles & Huberman, 1994).  An \niterative coding process involves redefining open code definitions until both researchers’ \nreported findings match based on their understanding of the code definition and what to report. \nResearchers collaborated following every article and implemented an iterative process of editing \nthe codebook and reassessing their coding (Miles & Huberman, 1994). After completing this \nprocess with each article, researchers independently provided summaries for each descriptive \ncode and collaborated to achieve consensus in the reported codes (Larsson, 1993; Miles & \nHuberman, 1994).   \nCoding, Table 1.3. The coding scheme developed out of the descriptive analysis in Table \n1.6 (Nastasi, 2009).  The findings from the descriptive analysis were reviewed and developed \ninto a coding scheme based content within each article and based on how findings have been \npresented in articles with similar content (e.g., King et al., 2007; Woodward & Willoughby, \n2014). Open codes, (distinct concepts or categories) were operationalized by the research team \n(Miles & Huberman, 1994). The researchers applied the codes to the first five articles to assess \nthe quality of the codebook. In applying the codebook, researchers consulted the summarized \nfindings in Table 1.6, and then consulted the original article if more information was needed.  \nThe codes were revised for clarification purposes using an iterative coding process (Miles & \nHuberman, 1994). No changes in the codebook were noted after reviewing the fifth article. Once \n22 \n \nthe codebook was clarified, the research team independently coded all articles but compared their \nresults after completing their independent coding of each source. When comparing their \nindependent coding, percentage agreement indices were attained where each article was \ndesignated as an opportunity to match within each code. Given that some codes could have \nmultiple codes that applied (e.g., a treatment goal could include modifying the environment and \npsychoeducating the clients), the research team needed to report the same combination of codes \nfor each article to be considered a unit of match within the percentage agreement index. There \nwere a total of 15 opportunities to match within each code as there were 15 studies included in \nthis review. Researchers set the coding threshold of 80%, based on standards assigned by \nBakeman and Gottman (1987) meaning if they reached at least 80% in their percentage \nagreement index for each unit described above, they could continue independently coding. If the \nresearchers demonstrated a percentage agreement index below 80%, they would review the next \narticle together to ensure sufficient codebook development. They compared their results and \nyielded the following percent agreement indices for each code: Study Type (100%), Recruitment \nType (100%), Consent Procedures (100%),  Population Label (93%), Participant Age Range \n(100%), Treatment Type (86%), Treatment Beneficiaries (93%), Treatment Goal (93%), Sample-\nSpecific Goal (86%), Research Design/Measurement (100%), Outcomes (86%) and \nRecommendations (80%).  \nResults \nThe results of this study are structured to inform the research questions that guide this \ninvestigation (e.g., what counseling and psychotherapy methods have been practiced over time, \nwhat consent and recruitment procedure have been used over time, how have they been \nmeasured over time, what studies yielded change in their clients over time, and what \n23 \n \nrecommendations have been provided for treating LGBTQ youth over time).  Findings present \neach category, their definition, the codes within them, the codes’ frequency, along with the year \nand context in which the codes occur. Table 1.3 uses the first column to depict the categories \ndiscussed in the results. The first row in the table depicts the article number that corresponds to \neach source, found in Table 1.1. The second row of Table 1.3 lists the publication year of each \narticle. Articles in this review are presented in the chronological order in which they were \npublished to underscore the “over time” aspect of all research questions.

These \ncodes inform the sample and treatment characteristics provided. Research question two (What \nrecruitment and consent procedures have studies implementing counseling and psychotherapy \nused when treating LGBTQ youth clients and how have these practices changed over time?) was \nanswered via the codes: recruitment and consent procedure. Research question three (How have \nstudies that use counseling and psychotherapy with LGBTQ youths’ described research designs \nand measurement strategies used and how have research designs and measurement changed over \ntime?) was addressed by the following code: research design/measurement. The fourth research \nquestion (What counseling and psychology provisions were depicted as evoking significant \nchange in their clients, and how have reports of significant change evolved over time?) was \naddressed by the code: outcomes. The fifth research question (What recommendations were \nmade to inform how counseling and psychotherapy provisions could yield the most effective \nexperiences for LGBTQ youth clients?) was addressed by the code: recommendations. \nPublication year was documented to account for change over time.  \n \n \n26 \n \n \n \n27 \n \nPublication Year. \n Search limits were set from 1900-present day. The first included article within this search \nappeared in 1978. Of the 15 included sources, two articles reported on counseling and \npsychotherapy in the 1970’s (n = 2; 13%), with no sources identified in the 1980’s. \nDocumentation of counseling and psychotherapy with LGBTQ youth was present in the 1990’s \n(n = 4; 27%), 2000’s (n = 2; 13%) and the 2010’s (n = 7; 47%). The initial presence of studies in \nthe 1970’s could relate to the greater attention to Homosexuality’s removal from the DSM while \nthe greatest frequency of studies in the 2010’s could speak to the acceptance of the LGBTQ \nyouth and their need for mental health services (Office of Surgeon General, 2001). \nThrough the remaining results, codes will be discussed by the decades in which they \noccurred. To convey each code’s prevalence by decade, frequency counts will be reported as (n = \na of b), where a denotes the number of studies indicating that code in the stated decade, and \nwhere b indicates the total number of studies included in this review from that decade. The \nfollowing seven codes will address the first research question: what counseling and \npsychotherapy practices documented in research have been implemented with LGBT youth and \nhow have they evolved over time?  \nParticipant Information \nPopulation label. Population label refers to the terms used in articles to denote the \npopulation of interest being studied. The Pathological code (n = 2) appeared once in the 1990’s \nas Gender Identity Disorder (Babinski & Reyes, 1994) and once in the 2010’s. The later study \nused the non-pathological label, “Gender Nonconforming youth”, but also referenced “the \ngender dysphoric child”, which is currently in the DSM-5 (Ehrensaft, 2013; APA, 2013). The \ncode, Homosexual (n = 2), was referenced only in the 1970’s. A majority of studies (n = 7) \n28 \n \nreferenced the population they serve as Lesbian, Gay Bisexual, Transgender and/or Queer \n(LGBTQ). This label appeared in the 1990’s (n = 3 of 4), 2000’s (n = 1 of 2) and 2010’s (n = 3 of \n7). Furthermore, some studies applied multiple label use (n = 4), where participants were labeled \nwith their sexual orientation or gender identity, and with an additional identity characteristic such \nas their ethnicity (e.g., “multiethnic sexual minority”). Multiple label use was first referenced in \n2008, with the remaining three references appearing in the 2010’s. Since 2000, researchers (n = 8 \nof 9) have used population labels (e.g., multiple label use or LGBTQ) that are less laden with \npathology while studies with publication years closer to Homosexuality’s removal from the DSM \nin the 1970’s may use more pathological terms for the participant label.  \nAge range. The age range code conveys how studies have historically conceptualized \n“LGBTQ youth” in terms of age. Some studies (n = 2) discussed youth as being high school \naged, while others provided actual age ranges (n = 5). Studies that reported age ranges (n = 4 of \n5) were from the 2010’s and the 1990’s (n = 1 of 2) (Remafedi, 1994). The span of LGBTQ \nyouth participant age ranges across all studies included ages from 10-21 years.  \nSample size. Several studies had a single participant design (n = 8). Single case design, \nincluded case studies (descriptive analyses of a single client in therapy, based on the perspective \nof the researcher) and approaches like applied behavior analysis with one participant. These \nstudies were present in the 1970’s (n = 2 of 2), the 1990’s (n = 2 of 4), the 2000’s (n = 2 of 2), \nand in the 2010’s (n = 2 of 7). Harvey and Fish, (2015) had two participants while other studies \ncontained larger sample sizes (n = 6). Larger sample sizes ranged from 10 participants to 392. \nThese studies were documented in the 1990’s (n = 2 of 4) and the 2010’s (n = 4 of 7). Studies \nwith larger sample sizes may appear more frequently in the 1990’s and 2010’s as demands for \nadvanced quantitative methodology grow among the research community.  \n29 \n \nTreatment Information \nTreatment type. Eight studies used a single treatment type (n = 8), while the remaining \nstudies (n = 7) used a combination of treatments to inform their counseling and psychotherapy \napproach. Additional treatment types that are not counseling and psychotherapy (e.g., medicinal \nand psychoeducation) were included, to inform what services are provided in tandem. Behavior \nmodification (n = 2) was present in the 1970’s (n = 1 of 2) and 1990’s (n = 1 of 4), which aimed \nto decrease effeminate behaviors associated with Homosexuality or Gender Nonconforming \nindividuals (Babinski & Reyes, 1994; McKinlay, Kelly, Patterson, 1978). Studies used \npsychodynamic/psychoanalysis (n = 2) in the 1970’s (n = 1 of 2) and 1990’s (n = 1 of 4), \n(Gonzalez, 1979; Stone, 1999) where therapists related client self-report to their subconscious \ndesire for same sex relations. One study combined behavior modification with milieu and \nmedicinal treatments to control his aggressive behaviors (which included “homosexually acting \nout”) (Babinski & Reyes, 1994).  \nPsychoeducation (n = 3) was present in the 1990’s (n = 2 of 3) and focused on HIV \nprevention of LGBTQ clients, while promoting education and community settings to amend their \ndiscrimination-based perspectives on LGBTQ issues. Both of these studies also used counseling, \nwith specific techniques unspecified (n = 2) as a combined provision of \ncounseling/psychotherapy (Uribe & Harbeck, 1992; Remafedi, 1994). The most recent study that \nincorporated psychoeducation aimed to equip LGBTQ youth with coping skills to manage their \nexperiences of marginalization (Heck, 2015).  \nSeveral studies exhibited culture focused and affirmative methods (n = 9), with \nprevalence in the 2000’s (n = 2 of 2) and 2010’s (n = 7 of 7). These studies exhibited the \nfollowing treatment types: attachment based family therapy (n = 1), affirmative approach (n = 1), \n30 \n \nclient centered (n = 1), cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 2), culture informed therapy (n = 3), \nstrength-based (n = 2), queer culture informed therapy (n = 1), and true gender self-therapy (n = \n1). A study exhibiting attachment based family therapy worked with LGBTQ youth and their \nfamilies to understand their family dynamics (Diamond et al., 2013). Youth were taught to have \nlimits with their parents (e.g., knowing when to walk away to avoid overwhelming stress), while \nremaining empathetic to their parents’ needs (e.g., learning the coming out process is significant \nfor parents and to give them time to adjust). Parents were conversely informed about coming out \nand how to be supportive of their child.  \nCulture-specific counseling and psychotherapy treatments (e.g., culture informed therapy, \ntrue gender self-therapy, queer culture informed therapy, and client centered) aimed to address \nthe culture specific needs of LGBTQ youth clients that may be overlooked in typical therapy \n(Wynn & West-Olatunji, 2008).  One study used culture informed therapy and a client centered \nframework to foster the client’s values and norms and to accentuate interconnectedness, cultural \nawareness, and authenticity (Wynn & West-Olatunji, 2008). Nyland’s (2007) study used queer \nculture informed therapy and asked clients to identify a pop culture/fictional icon as a role model \nto help clients make meaning and take action in their own lives. True Gender Self Therapy was \nused by Ehrensaft (2013) to address stressors related to client body changes, to affirm their \npresent gender identity, and to build coping strategies. True Gender Self Therapy made a point of \nkeeping clients in therapy after their gender transition, to help them cope with unanticipated \nstressors associated with this part of the developmental process. \nThe treatment types, affirmative (n = 1; 1 of 7) and strength based (n = 2; 2 of 7) were \npresent in the 2010’s. Affirmative and strength based treatment types aimed to validate LGBTQ \nyouth clients’ identities as LGBTQ and focus on the positive aspects of themselves, respectively.  \n31 \n \nCraig, Austin, and McInroy, (2014) used affirmative treatment with multiethnic sexual minority \nyouth who were taught resilience tools to manage unsupportive environments given their likely \nexposure to marginalizing experiences. Harvey and Fish (2015) conducted a strength-based study \nwhere youth cultivated their personality, resilience, and resource strengths to promote their self-\nworth. This practice aimed to lessen effects of their exposure to oppression.  \nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was present in the 2010’s (n = 2; 2 of 7).  CBT \naimed to amend negative views based on experiences of rejection, negative societal views, and \nidentity struggles (e.g., concealing who participants were). Cognitive tools helped reframe how \nparticipants perceived stressors, while not changing their sexual orientation or gender identity. \nWithin the context of this review, both studies attempting to modify participants’ \nbehaviors occurred in the 1970’s and 1990’s, while nine out of nine studies exhibiting culturally \nresponsive practice occurred in the 2000’s and onward. LaSala (2013) and the Office of the \nSurgeon General (2001) noted an American societal shift towards acceptance of the LGBTQ \ncommunity, which could relate to the later presence of these studies in the review.   \nTreatment beneficiaries. The code, treatment beneficiaries informs who actively engaged \nin counseling and psychotherapy as clients over time. All studies (n = 15) provided counseling \nand psychotherapy to the primary client (the LGBTQ youth); however, several studies also \nincorporated family members (n = 2), the community (n = 1), and the LGBTQ youths’ schools (n \n= 2). Uribe and Harbeck (1992) reported findings on educating the public about LGBTQ youth to \npromote awareness among community and school environments in the 1990’s. The remaining \nstudies with additional beneficiaries (e.g., family members, community, and schools) were \ndocumented in the 2010’s (n = 3; 3 of 7).  \n32 \n \nSchool involvement in counseling and psychotherapy served to develop their \nacceptability and sensitivity to LGB issues (Uribe & Harbeck, 1992). Uribe & Harbeck (1992) \nimplemented Project 10, a counseling program aimed to influence the discriminatory perceptions \nof communities and schools. The community was involved in this study via publicity about the \nintervention. They were educated with brochures in community, articles in the newspaper (The \nLos Angeles Times), and media coverage on television. Content of the coverage was related to \nthe intervention being implemented in a school setting. Project 10 attempted to break through the \n“wall of silence” with LGB issues to normalize views of LGB culture (Uribe & Harbeck, 1992, \npg. 19). School involvement included: training teachers, administrators, and counselors how to \nadminister the intervention and how to address discrimination. Students were directly involved \nvia discussions in health classes, and by watching the documentary “What if I’m Gay” (Uribe & \nHarbeck, 1992, pg. 24). These activities fostered acceptance and understanding. \nFamilies were involved to reconcile their beliefs about their child’s sexual orientation (or \ngender identity), their own religious influences, their own fears, family rejection due to others’ \ndisappointment in their child, and concerns about their child’s welfare (Diamond et al., 2013). \nCounseling occurred alone with parents, to allow candid discussion about their shame, fear and \nanger. One study described family (particularly parents) inclusion in one-on-one \ncounseling/psychotherapy using attachment-based family therapy as a way to develop empathy \nand support of their children (Diamond et al., 2013). Studies that involved only the adolescent as \nthe client in counseling or psychotherapy were present in the 1970’s (n = 2 of 2), the 1990’s (n = \n3 of 4), the 2000’s (n = 2 of 2) and the 2010’s (n = 4 of 7). While client only sessions appear \nthroughout the decades of included articles, a majority of studies in this review with additional \nbeneficiaries occurred in the 2010. This finding could refer to LaSala’s (2013) indication of \n33 \n \nsocietal acceptance of the LGBTQ community, and could represent the accepting modern \nperspective of incorporating others (e.g., family) in counseling and psychotherapy rather than \nassuming ‘problems’ are only within the LGBTQ client. \nTreatment Targeted Aspects of Change \nTreatment goal. Treatment goals were documented to understand the objectives of \ncounseling and psychotherapy for their LGBTQ youth clients and how these goals have changed \nover time. Two studies documented goals of mainstreaming (n = 2) clients to normative culture \nand away from their Heterosexual tendencies. Techniques used to achieve mainstreaming \nincluded modeling masculine (gender appropriate) behaviors, providing videotaped feedback, \nand repetitive rehearsal (behavior modification techniques) (McKinlay et al., 1978).  Babinski \nand Reyes (1994) implemented mainstreaming goals in a hospital setting. These studies appeared \nin the 1970’s (n = 1 of 2) and the 1990’s (n = 1 of 4). \nPsychoeducation was described as a treatment goal (n = 2) in the 1990’s (n = 2 of 4). \nPsychoeducation goals served to inform LGBTQ youth about combating feelings of inadequacy \nor how to manage self-destructive behaviors. Community settings benefited from \npsychoeducation goals, which aimed to directly lessen perceptions of discrimination towards the \nLGBTQ community and to indirectly develop a more positive social climate for LGBTQ youth \n(Uribe & Harbeck, 1992).  \nEach study from 1999 onward had goals of affirming LGBTQ youths’ identities (n = 10; \n1990’s n = 1 of 4; 2000’s n = 2 of 2; 2010’s n = 7 of 7). Affirming identities refers to \nencouraging youth to work through issues, while promoting acceptance and pride in their \n34 \n \nLGBTQ identity. The goal, modifying LGBTQ youth’s environment (n = 2) co-occurred with \nother treatment goals (e.g., mainstreaming or affirm identity) when it was reported in the review. \nOne study had a treatment goal, “other” and was only present in the 1970’s (n = 1 of 2) \n(Gonzalez, 1979). The study’s primary purpose was to address the client’s psychosis, however, \naddressing their sexual orientation through therapy was a targeted behavior as well. The presence \nof affirmative studies in more recent years within this review could align with the acceptance and \nnormalization of LGBTQ culture in society, while goals of mainstreaming clients toward \nnormative culture demands was present in studies from the 1970’s and 1990’s could relate to the \nlabeling of “homosexuality” as a disorder by the DSM until the early 1970’s, the marginalization \nof LGBTQ community with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the lacing acceptance of the LGBTQ \ncommunity at during these decades. \nSample-specific goals. Sample specific goals depict how studies described participants’ \npresenting concerns and how they changed over time. Counseling and psychotherapy were most \nfrequently sought to remediate internalizing concerns (n = 9) and to foster resilience (n = 9). \nStudies also conveyed clients as presenting with internalized homophobia/heterosexism (n = 7), \nfamily concerns (n = 6), drug use (n = 3), suicidal actions or thoughts (n = 3), effeminate \nbehaviors (n = 2), self-esteem (n = 2), unsafe sex behaviors (n = 1), and dropout risk (n = 1).  \nOf the discussed sample specific goals, addressing effeminate behaviors appeared in the \n1970’s (n = 1 of 2) and 1990’s (n = 1 of 4) (Babinski & Reyes, 1994; McKinlay et al., 1978), \nwhile family concerns (fc) and resilience (rp) appeared in the 2000’s (FC n = 1 of 2; RP n = 2 of \n2) and 2010’s (FC n = 4 of 7; RP n = 6 of 7). Family concern refers to worrying about a client’s \nidentity, or struggling with values that perceive homosexuality as sinful (Duarté-Vélez, Bernal, \n35 \n \n& Bonilla, 2010). Sample specific goals of resilience were addressed by working on problem \nsolving and developing coping skills (Craig et al., 2014). Resilience was discussed as a \npreventative tool, for situations that had not yet occurred, and as an intervening mechanism for \nsituations that have already transpired. \nInternalized homophobia and internalizing concerns was documented in each decade. \nInternalized homophobia frequencies include: 1970’s (n = 1 of 2), 1990’s (n = 1 of 4), 2000’s (n \n= 2 of 2), 2010’s (n = 3 of 7); and internalizing concerns frequencies include the following: \n1970’s (n = 1 of 2), 1990’s (n = 2 of 4), 2000’s (n = 1 of 2), 2010’s (n = 5 of 7). Articles from the \n1970’s and 1990’s tended to discuss participants’ internalized homophobia or internalized \nconcerns (n = 4 of 6) as mental illness due to sexual orientation and gender identity (e.g., \nBabinski & Reyes, 1994; Gonzalez, 1979; McKinlay, Kelly, Patterson, 1978). Conversely, a \nstudy from the 2010’s (Diamond et al., 2013, p. 98) discussed how treating internalizing \nconcerns via attachment based family therapy was thought to change parent’s parenting \ntechniques to be more supportive of their youth, as LGBTQ youth’s internalizing concerns were \nrelated to stress from their parents.  \nAmong the included articles in this study, addressing effeminate concerns appeared in \narticles from earlier decades, where stigmatization around ‘being more manly’ was the ideal and \neffeminate men were viewed as deviant (LaSala, 2013). Targeting family concerns and resilience \nin the 2000’s and 2010’s could relate to the acceptance agenda around LGBT youth where \nfamilies are incorporated into therapy to learn to accept their LGBTQ youth member. Resilience \ncould relate to societal trends of strength based empowerment of the LGBTQ community rather \nthan blaming them for their identity.  \n36 \n \nParticipant Recruitment \n The participant recruitment category and the consent procedures category answer \nresearch question two: What recruitment and consent procedures have studies implementing \ncounseling and psychotherapy used when treating LGBTQ youth clients and how have these \npractices changed over time? A total of ten studies reported recruiting youth from therapy where \nthe authors of the articles were the therapists discussing their sessions and findings. The youth in \nthese treatments received counseling and psychotherapy voluntarily (n = 6) or by prescription \nfrom someone else (e.g., parents) (n = 4). Voluntariness was interpreted when therapists would \nnote that a client “came to see me of his own volition” or when indication of free will was \ninvolved in their counseling and psychotherapy participation (Gonzalez, 1979, pg. 64). \nPrescribed treatment referred to when youth attended therapy involuntarily, per the demand of \nsomeone else such as a parent (e.g., Babinski & Reyes, 1994; McKinlay, Jelly, & Patterson, \n1978) or when parents would initiate their therapy (e.g., Ehrensaft, 2013). Youth who were in \ntreatment voluntarily appeared in articles from the 1970’s (n = 1 of 2), 1990’s (n = 1 of 4), \n2000’s (n = 1 of 2), and 2010’s (n = 1 of 7). Also, youth were in prescribed treatment for articles \nfrom the 1970’s (n = 1 of 2), 1990’s (n = 1 of 4), 2000’s (n = 1 of 2), and 2010’s (n = 3 of 7). \nYouth’s voluntary or involuntary inclusion in counseling and/or psychotherapy appears without \npatterns over the decades. This could indicate youth continue attending counseling and/or \npsychotherapy both voluntarily and involuntarily.  \nConvenience sample recruitment methods were implemented (n = 6) in the 1990’s (n = 1 \nof 4) and the 2010’s (n= 5 of 7). Convenience samples were attained from schools’ GSAs (e.g., \nHeck, 2015) or students within a school piloting a counseling and psychotherapy program (Uribe \n& Harbeck, 1992). Snowball recruitment techniques were implemented (n = 2) in the 1990’s (n = \n37 \n \n2 of 4) where participants recommended therapy to others (e.g., Remadfedi, 1994). Commercial \nadvertisement (n = 2) occurred in the 1990’s (n = 2 of 4) where newspaper articles and \ncommercials garnered interest from the community (Uribe & Harbeck, 1992). Presence of media \nrecruitment in the 1990’s could relate to media coverage related to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of \nthis time, while convenience samples occurring in most of the documented articles from the \n2010’s could relate to further developments in ways to recruit LGBTQ youth in ways limiting \npotential outing or disclosing of their identity. Limited discussion in articles was provided to \ninform how the specific recruitment methods were enacted. \nConsent Procedures \n Consent procedures were often not discussed or available in articles (n = 11). Four \narticles discussed consent procedures. These four articles indicated using assent procedures with \nyouth participants (n = 4) and appeared concurrently with either parental consent (n = 2) or \nwaived consent (n = 2) procedures. Articles that mentioned implementing waived consent and \nassent procedures occurred in the 1990’s (n = 1 of 4) and the 2010’s (n = 1 of 7). Parental \nconsent and assent procedures appeared in the 2010’s (n = 2 of 7). None of the articles specified \nusing in loco parentis, where a youth advocate or adult ally to the LGBTQ community signed a \nform in lieu of parent consent. Details around the procedures of waived consent were limited and \nindicated “parent consent was not required” (Remafedi, 1994).  \nResearch Design/Measurement  \n Research design and measurement was reported to convey the methodology used to track \nand report progress of clients in counseling/psychotherapy over time, and was the single category \nused to depict research question three: How have studies that use counseling and psychotherapy \nwith LGBTQ youths’ described research designs and measurement strategies used and how have \n38 \n \nresearch designs and measurement changed over time? The most frequent methodology used to \ntrack clients’ progress was via case study where therapists’ enacted their own descriptive \nnarrative of progress (n = 8) based on their perceptions. While a case study is a  can be a type of \nqualitative data, it was differentiated as its own research design category to note its vast \nrepresentation among the included studies. This was followed by quantitative methods where \nscales and statistics were identified units of data analysis (n = 3), mixed methods, the \ncombination of qualitative and quantitative methods (measures/scales and statistics) (n = 3), and \nqualitative methods (n = 1), where participants were asked open-ended questions in surveys and \ninterviews where data enlisted analyses beyond a descriptive narrative account. Case study \nmethodology was documented through all decades, while a majority of articles (n = 5 of 7) with \nmore empirical results (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methodologies) appeared in the \n1990’s (n = 2 of 4) and 2010’s (n = 5 of 7). The later presence of qualitative, quantitative, and \nmixed methodologies articles in this review could be due to increasing research standards and \nrigor as these methods incorporate more rigorous methodology. \nQuantitative methods were used to track change in participants, therapists’ perspectives, \nand parents’ well being. These changes were documented via measures, which are included in \nTables 1.5a, 1.5b, and 1.5c. These tables include the operationalized constructs that were \nassessed and the corresponding scales used to measure the constructs’ change. Qualitative \nanalyses were often gathered via interviews and surveys with closed and open-ended questions. \nThe questions aimed to understand LGB youths’ experiences, problems and attitudes related to \nschool settings (Uribe & Harbeck, 1992), their experiences related to physical/domestic abuse \nand home life (Craig, 2012), and to attain feedback about an implemented intervention \n39 \n \ncurriculum (Heck, 2015). The methods for analyzing qualitative data were often not included in \nthe articles.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1.5b.

Many studies had self-reported findings by the therapist, where the discussed \nchange comes from their perspectives.  Studies noted change as occurring (n = 7), not occurring \n(n = 2), and as having mixed outcomes (with some change and no change reported) (n = 5). One \nstudy reporting no outcomes regarding the mental health gains made in their participants, but \nreported outcomes related to participants’ satisfaction with the intervention components.  Change \nwas reported in the 1970’s (n = 1 of 2), in the 1990’s (n = 2 of 4), 2000’s (n = 2 of 2), and in the \n2010’s (n = 2 of 7). No change was reported in the 1970’s (n = 1 of 2) and 1990’s (n = 1 of 4). \nWhile one study demonstrated mixed findings in the 1990’s, the remaining mixed findings \nstudies were documented in the 2010’s (n = 4). \nOf the 7 studies that noted change, a majority (n = 6) were case studies with therapist \nself-reported descriptive analysis as the methodology. A majority (n = 6) of these studies also \nhad sample sizes of one or two LGBTQ clients. Conversely, most of the studies (n = 4) with \n41 \n \nmixed findings used mixed methods, as well as qualitative and quantitative methodologies; and \nhad greater sample sizes to denote statistical significance and saturation of qualitative data.  \nRecommendations \n Recommendations were reported to answer research question five, to identify what \npractitioners and researchers should reportedly do when providing counseling and psychotherapy \nto LGBTQ youth. One study recommended using behavior modification (n = 1) in the 1970’s (n \n= 1 of 2) to foster mainstream behaviors (e.g., more masculine behaviors for Gay men or \nconsistent dress with one’s gender designated at birth). Studies that called for a prevention \nframework (n = 2) occurred in the 1990’s (n = 2 of 4). Both studies informed safe sex promotion \naround HIV and AIDS.   \nSome studies recommended educating LGBTQ youth about their identity and related risk \nfactors (n = 2). These two studies occurred in the 1990’s (n = 1 of 4) and the 2000’s (n = 1 of 2). \nOne study suggested incorporating pop culture into counseling and psychotherapy in the 2000’s \n(n = 1 of 2). Other studies recommended continued therapy (n = 2), where practitioners and \nresearchers were urged not to end treatment prematurely.  Continued therapy appeared in a case \nstudy that focused on resolving psychosis in the 1990’s (n = 1 of 4) and in a case study involving \ngender identity in the 2010’s (n = 1 of 7) (Ehrensaft, 2013). Ehrensaft (2013) indicated treatment \nshould not end immediately following the completion of one’s gender transition as identity \ndevelopment and new, marginalizing experiences may come up that require processing. Babinski \nand Reyes, (1994) recommended continued therapy since their client was not responding to \npsychotherapy and continued showing symptoms of psychosis.  \nStudies also recommended enacting a culture specific framework (n = 3) in the 1990’s (n \n= 1 of 4) and 2010’s (n = 2 of 7). Studies called for interventions to address developmental and \n42 \n \nsocial issues unique to LGBTQ youth (e.g., Remafedi, 1994) and due to youths’ exposure to \nmarginalization and discrimination (Duarté-Véle et al., 2010; Craig et al., 2014).  \nSeveral articles from the 2010’s recommended incorporating others from the LGBTQ \nyouths’ environment into treatment (n = 4 of 7). Two studies recommended working with parents \nto help them accept their child’s sexual orientation or gender identity, to educate them about their \nchild’s oppressed experiences, and to foster their support of their LGBTQ youth (Diamond et al., \n2013; Harvey & Fish, 2015). The other studies suggested schools should foster accepting \natmospheres for their LGBTQ students (Craig et al., 2014; Heck, 2015). Heck (2015) discussed \nGSA’s as ideal places to offer LGBTQ youth services since they are considered safe spaces in \nschools to access services and find supportive relationships.  \nStudies that emphasized the importance of having a meaningful client/therapist \nrelationship (n = 3) were identified in the 2010’s (n = 3 of 7). Another study by Craig (2012) \nrecommended enacting a strength-based approach in the 2010’s (n = 1 of 7), where focusing on \nclients’ strengths (e.g., hobbies, school performance, etc.) helps to build rapport and develop \npositive self perceptions.  \nIn considering how these findings appear across time, recommendations for behavior \nmodification were present in earlier studies of this review, and accord with the standards of \nmarginalizing the LGBTQ community and favoring heterosexual lifestyles (LaSala, 2013). The \nstudies that recommended educating LGBTQ youth about risk factors were present in the 1990’s \nand 2000’s, when HIV/AIDS intervention and prevention were prevalent conversations. Finally, \nrecommendations to incorporate others into the LGBTQ youths’ therapeutic experience (e.g., \nfamily) and for the LGBTQ youth to have meaningful relationships with their therapist calls on \nthe societal acceptance of the LGBTQ community where the focus turned from changing the \n43 \n \nLGBTQ youth client and towards altering their environment to better suit their mental health  \n(LaSala, 2013). \nBelow is Table 1.6, which depicts the descriptive analysis of the included studies.  \n44 \n \n45 \n \n46 \n \n47 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nLGBTQ youth may seek out counseling or psychotherapy related to their experiences of \nmarginalization, and identity development with regard to coming out and the disclosure process \n(Goodrich & Luke, 2009). Given the historical stigmatization of the LGBTQ youth community \nin America, practitioners and researchers should be informed of the counseling and \npsychotherapy implemented with these youth so they can provide services that are ethical, \nrelevant and culturally appropriate. This chapter is the first to systematically review counseling \nand psychotherapy provisions for LGBTQ youth and to explore both the chronological context \nand the characteristics of the service provisions received by these youth.  \nThere are several unique contributions from this study. First, it’s important to consider \nthat only 15 studies were found eligible to be reviewed. This indicates the urgent call for more \nresearch in the area of LGBTQ counseling and psychotherapy so researchers and practitioners \ncan have access to more empirical and evidence based practices to inform their work. The dearth \n48 \n \nof studies on LGBTQ youth counseling and psychotherapy could relate to LaSala’s (2013) point \nthat society has recently demonstrated acceptance towards the LGBTQ youth community. This \ncould indicate recent acceptability of enacting counseling and psychotherapy with these youth. It \ncould also relate to recruitment or consent/assent limitations with this population (Varjas et al., \n2008). \nAlthough this chapter is limited in its ability to make generalizable claims about the \nhistorical context of each study, it is among the first to contextualize LGBTQ youth counseling \nand psychotherapy practice findings within a historical framework. LaSala’s (2013) commentary \non the societal shift from a blaming agenda towards an affirming one for LGBTQ youth mirrors \nseveral of the articles included in this review. While the King et al. (2007) article shares each \nstudy’s publication date, a historical context was not provided.  \nAnother unique finding of this chapter is that it is among the first to explore enacted \ncounseling and psychotherapy practices with LGBTQ youth. While King et al. (2007) presents a \ndescriptive analysis of counseling and psychotherapy practices with LGBTQ adults, this study \nuses a combination of descriptive and coded findings with LGBTQ youth. The current study \noffers unique findings with regard to each research question answered.  \nThe first research question, what counseling and psychotherapy practices documented in \nresearch have been implemented with LGBT youth and how have they evolved over time, this \nstudy was the first to systematically identify the types of implemented therapy for LGBTQ youth.  \nIn considering similar studies (e.g., King et. al., 2007), types of counseling and psychotherapy \nwere considered as whether clients used mainstream services or specialized services rather than \nexploring the specific types of psychotherapy or counseling in which the clients engaged. In the \ncurrent chapter, specific practices such as behavior modification (McKinlay, Kelly, & Patterson, \n49 \n \n1978) and psychodynamic/psychoanalysis (e.g., Gonzalez, 1979) were implemented to reduce \nhomosexual or gender diverse tendencies in the client. It is important to note that behavior \nmodification and psychoanalysis have been used to evoke positive change with youth in other \ncircumstances (e.g., Skinner, Shapiro, Turco, Cole & Brown, 1992; Weitkamp et al., 2014). \nAffirmative, culturally responsive methods were also implemented and include: True Gender \nSelf Therapy (Ehrensaft, 2013), Queer Culture Informed Therapy (e.g., Nylund, 2007), and \nCognitive Behavioral Therapy with Cultural Modifications (e.g., Duarte-Velez, Bernal, & \nBonilla, 2010).  \nThe second research question focused on recruitment and consent procedures. King et al. \n(2007) summarized the recruitment methods for each included study. Since their study was \nfocused on LGBT adults and often targeted venues specific to adult populations (e.g., bars) there \nremained a dearth of research on recruitment methods for LGBTQ youth. The current chapter \nidentified recruitment methods for LGBTQ youth as including convenience samples through \nGSA’s, snowball sampling, commercial advertisement, and proposing research participation \nwhile youth were in therapy for LGBTQ relates issues. As indicated by Varjas et al. (2008), \nstudies either asked youth or their parents directly to participate when their identity was already \ndisclosed in therapy or a GSA, or via indirect methods of youth sharing study information with \nother youth who they knew were out or via mass advertisement. Studies that provided \ninformation on their recruitment methods included minimal information about the steps/process \nimplemented to replicate their practices.  \nThe King et al. (2007) did not discuss consent procedures, likely due to the samples being \nable to consent for themselves as adults. The current chapter is among the first to review consent \nprocedures for LGBTQ youth involvement in counseling and psychotherapy informed research. \n50 \n \nFour articles in this chapter discussed consent procedures and only two studies used waived \nconsent. The limited conversation around informed consent in this review points to the need to \ndevelop this conversation. Researchers and practitioners should not assume that LGBTQ youth \ncan use typical parent consent procedures as acquiring their consent could lead to disclosing \none’s sexual orientation/gender identity before they are ready to disclose (Varjas et al., 2008). \nWhile only two studies waived consent, future studies should aim to replicate their procedures \n(e.g., in loco parentis/waived consent) to ensure voices of youth without access to parent consent \nrepresented in research.  \nThis study is also among the first to inform what measures have been used in research to \ndetermine counseling and psychotherapy effects with LGBTQ youth. Case studies were \nimplemented and relied on researcher’s descriptive recount of the provided counseling and \npsychotherapy. Case study results should be interpreted with caution as the authors in these \narticles did not discuss implemented methods to limit their biases and to promote objectivity in \ntheir report of findings. Case studies composed six of the eight studies from the 1970’s, 1990’s \nand 2000’s. Mixed methods and quantitative methods were in five of the seven studies from the \n2010’s. The implemented methodologies from studies in this review could relate to historical \nmethodology standards (Nastasi et al., 2007). Nastasi et al. (2007) called for interventions with \ndiverse populations to use a mixed methods approach to assess progress with quantitative \nmethods and to describe cultural relevance via qualitative methods.  \nThis study also provided a list of measures and the constructs they are designed to \nconvey. While researchers and practitioners should reference these tables to inform the measures \nused in prior research with LGBTQ youth, it is important to note that the measures included were \nnot constructed with LGBTQ youth populations.   The reported measures in this chapter were not \n51 \n \nculture specific to LGBTQ youth. To gain further insight and a thorough understanding of what \nmeasures convey, researchers and practitioners should used mixed methods approach to evaluate \ncounseling and psychotherapy (Nastasi et al., 2007, Office of the Surgeon General, 2001). \nThe findings from the fourth and fifth research question inform which counseling and \npsychology methods have been found to result in positive change in clients and about which \nrecommendations were made to promote effective work with LGBTQ youth in counseling and \npsychotherapy. The scope of this chapter is limited in its ability to deduce what aspects of the \nstudies related to detected change in the results. However, certain studies presented as meeting \nthe ethical standards of practice by the American Counseling (2016), American Psychological \n(2016) and the American Psychiatric (2013) Associations. The articles from this review that met \nthe ethical standards of practice were the following in chronological order: Uribe & Harbeck, \n1992; Remafedi, 1994; Nylund, 2007; Wynn & West-Olatunji, 2008; Duarté Vélez, Bernal, & \nBonilla, 2010; Craig, 2012; Ehrensaft, 2013; Diamond et al., 2013; Craig, Austin, & McInroy, \n2014; Harvey & Fish, 2015; Heck, 2015. These articles practiced cultural responsiveness, used \naffirmative practice, incorporated prevention efforts in addition to intervention components, and \nincorporated an ecological component where people in the LGBTQ youths’ lives were included \nin counseling and psychotherapy sessions. These components of counseling and psychotherapy \nwere also noted as recommendations that researchers and practitioners should enact in their own \npractice.  \nStudies that did not meet ethical standards of American Counseling (2016), American \nPsychological (2016) and/or the American Psychiatric (2016) Associations included (in \nchronological order): McKinlay, Kelly, & Patterson, 1978; Gonzalez, 1979; Babinski & Reyes, \n1994; Stone, 1999. While we would not expect studies from the 1970’s and 1990’s to reflect the \n52 \n \nsame ethical values of current standards, the differing expectations may inform how social \nexpectations of each decade or timeframe may relate to the counseling and psychotherapy \npractice. These studies pathologized LGBTQ youth based on their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity when other aspects should have been documented as the primary concern (e.g., drug use \nor mental illness).  \nLimitations \nCaution should be exercised when reaching conclusions from this review as only 15 \nstudies met criteria for inclusion. The types of treatment and content of each study varied within \nthe systematic review. The limited number of included studies and the variation of content make \nit difficult to discuss chronological trends within the data and to generalize findings beyond this \nstudy. Nevertheless, when considering each study in this review within a historical context, \nresearchers and practitioners can make sense of certain practices that occur but conclusions and \ngeneralizations about historical contextualization cannot be made from the current study.   \nMeta-analysis was unable to be used since a majority of the included studies lacked pre-\ntest/post-test data and since a majority of them were case studies with descriptive data. Samples \nfrom the studies in this review typically included high school aged youth with sexual orientation \ndiversity. There was limited representation of youth with gender diversity and from younger age \nranges. Even though sexual minority youth and gender diverse youth are included the LGBTQ \nyouth construct, they are different, unique cultures (Office of the Surgeon General, 2001). Only \nsamples from the United States were included, limiting this study’s ability to be generalized \ninternationally. \n53 \n \nImplications for Practice \n Findings from this review indicate several implications for counseling and psychotherapy \npractice with LGBTQ youth. Most importantly, this study identified potentially harmful \ntechniques when working with LGBTQ youth (e.g., invalidating their identity or seeking to \n“cure” their sexual orientation or gender identity). Practitioners should review these studies \n(Babinski & Reyes, 1994; Gonzalez, 1979; McKinlay, Kelly, & Patterson, 1978; Stone, 1999) to \nnote practices they should avoid enacting. Conversely, several studies presented ethically sound \ncounseling and psychotherapy with LGBTQ youth, and practitioners are encouraged to review \nthese articles as well. These studies accord with APA (2016), ACA (2016), and APA (2016) \nethic standards that indicate practice should enact cultural responsiveness. Methods identified as \nculturally responsive in this review include Queer Culture Informed Therapy and Cognitive \nBehavior Therapy with Culture Modifications. The PCSIM model is an intervention method that \nadapts existing interventions to include culture modifications, which incorporates client \nperspectives in the intervention development process. For more information on PCSIM \nimplementation, please reference Nastasi, Bernstein and Varjas (2004). Ethical practice also calls \non practitioners enacting affirmative practice that validates LGBTQ youths’ identity as opposed \nto invalidating their identity (e.g., Babinski & Reyes, 1994). Studies can also enact prevention \nefforts to defend against potential concerns such as marginalization by surrounding LGBTQ \nyouth with supportive environments (e.g., gay straight alliances or engaging in family therapy to \npromote safe and healthy relationships for youth).   \nPractitioners are urged to continue exploring recruitment methods for youth to engage in \ntherapy. Many youth who need counseling and psychotherapy services may not have the support \nof their parents to help them access these services (if they are not already out to them or if \n54 \n \nparents disapprove of their identity).  King and colleagues (2007) identified recruitment \ntechniques such as snowball techniques, posting flyers, convenience samples in LGBTQ \ncommunity groups, or going to bars that are explicitly supportive of the LGBTQ community. \nThe current chapter identified recruitment methods such as approaching youth in GSAs, or \ninvolving youth in therapy per their parent’s (voluntarily or not). Practitioners should consider \nethical ways to advertise their counseling and psychotherapy services for LGBTQ youth, \nparticularly those without parents who are not supportive of their identity and who know about \ntheir child’s identity. Recruiting LGBTQ youth for counseling and psychotherapy via coming to \ntalk during a GSA meeting, having flyers, or leaving contact information with LGBTQ youth \ngroups may be an appropriate methods to engage youth in these services who may have a need.  \nPractitioners should also consider waiving consent in counseling and psychotherapy for \nLGBTQ youth.  Practitioners are ethically obligated to promote beneficence and nonmaleficence. \nFor LGBTQ youth who may need counseling and psychotherapy, requiring parent consent may \nbring them harm by prematurely outing them to their parents. Varjas et al. (2008) call for \nresearch to enact waived consent in research, and this chapter encourages counseling and \npsychotherapy providers to follow practices that medical doctors have enacted that allows youth \nto seek services if it will assist in improving their health and will not bring them harm (Society of \nHuman Resource Management, 2016).  \nPractitioners are encouraged to measure client progress in counseling and psychotherapy \nwith measures. Measures found to document progress in this chapter were normed on general \npopulations, rather than specifically with LGBTQ youth (The Office of the Surgeon General, \n2001). To account for potential cultural variations from the measure and to ensure validity, \npractitioners are encouraged to use mixed methods to track progress. Practitioners can use mixed \n55 \n \nmethods by asking participants about constructs being measures, so counseling and \npsychotherapy providers can understand the specific experience of their culturally diverse clients \n(Mertens, 2007).  \n While this study is limited in making generalizable conclusions based on chronology, the \ncontext in which service is delivered may influence our thoughts and biases, related to \ncounseling and psychotherapy practice. Practitioners are encouraged to challenge their biases and \nto have an awareness of their own identity, when working with LGBTQ youth. While self-\nawareness cannot guarantee practitioner objectivity, it challenges practitioners to question the \nethics and effectiveness related to their client’s counseling and psychotherapy experience. \nFuture Directions for Research \nThis study presents preliminary findings on counseling and psychotherapy provisions for \nLGBTQ youth that have been documented in research. As there are several articles in this review \ndepicting ethical practice, additional studies should be implemented, where the practices \nconsidered ethically sound are included (e.g., culture responsive treatment and incorporation of \nfamily and others into counseling and psychotherapy). Several articles, dissertations, and theses \nwere excluded from this review because they did not implement counseling and psychotherapy, \nbut included informative content regarding other mental health services for LGBTQ youth. \nParticularly, Martinez (2012) and Rosnik (2001) developed curricula to address high-risk \nbehaviors and internalized homophobia in gay youth. Other studies focused on mission \nstatements that promoted the termination of certain practices, such as reparative therapy (e.g., \nGrace, 2005). Future systematic reviews should be conducted on the mission statements of \nreparative and conversation therapy to inform the potential harm these practices can bring to \nLGBTQ youth and to inform the implications of counseling and psychotherapy that does not \n56 \n \nfoster the ethical obligation of nonmaleficence (ACA, 2005; NASP, 2010). Future systematic \nreviews should also review the content components of developed counseling and psychotherapy \ncurricula, that have been implemented and not implemented with LGBTQ youth. Such a review \ncould identify curriculum components, structures, or entire interventions worth implementing to \ninform evidence-based practice with LGBTQ youth. \nResearchers should continue implementing and evaluating counseling and psychotherapy \nprovisions with LGBTQ youth. As marginalized minors, LGBTQ youth lack representation in \nresearch. Providing a voice for these youth in research promotes further understanding of their \nunique experience and how to inform their counseling and psychotherapy services (Mertens, \n2007).  Future studies should replicate the psychotherapies implemented in the studies they deem \nethically appropriate with LGBTQ youth using mixed methodology, pretest/posttest findings, a \ncontrol group, and random assignment (when possible) to yield meta-analysis results.  \nFuture studies should explore recruitment procedures in greater detail for LGBTQ youth. \nRecruiting LGBTQ youth can be challenging as they are minors and/or they may not be out to \ntheir friends or family. By developing researcher’s understanding of ways to recruit LGBTQ \nyouth for research, we can inform our ability to represent their voices more frequently in \nresearch. Similarly, future research should explore waived consent practices, and whether youth \nwho implement this practice differ in their experiences from youth with access to parent consent. \nYouth without parent consent have limited representation in research due to minors needing \nparent consent to participate (Varjas et al., 2008). While including these youth and the practice of \nwaived consent in research is important to provide these youth with a voice, comparing them and \nyouth with access to parent consent can further depict their unique cultural experience. and the \nuse of waived/in loco parentis consent with the LGLBTQ youth community.  \n57 \n \nReferences \nAlmeida, J., Johnson, R.

Exploring a Model of Social Support and Nonsupport Among LGBTQ youth with \nand without Parent Consent  \nAs Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ) youth negotiate \ntheir identities, they are often confronted with unique challenges (e.g., disclosure to self and \nothers, and the coming out process) (Varjas, Kiperman, & Meyers, 2016). LGBTQ youth may \nalso experience discrimination related to their sexual orientation and/or gender identity via \nbullying (Almeida, Johnson, Corliss, Molnar, & Azrael, 2009; Button, O’Connell, & Gealt, \n2012), teasing (Espelage, Aragon, Birkett, & Koenig, 2008), harassment (D’Augelli & Patterson, \n2001; McCabe, Dragowski, & Rubinson, 2013), and negative school climate (Kosciw, Palmer, \nKull, & Greytak, 2013). Despite these negative experiences, many LGBTQ youth lead well \nadjusted, fulfilling lives when they perceive having access to supportive relationships \n(Kiperman, Varjas, Meyers, & Howard, 2014; Munoz-Plaza, Quinn, & Rounds, 2002). For \nexample, LGBTQ youth who report positive social supports have had higher educational \naspirations (e.g., Kosciw, Greytak, Bartkiewicz, Boesen, & Palmer, 2012), engaged in less drug \nuse (Button et al., 2012; Espelage et al., 2008), and exhibited greater mental health compared to \nLGBT youth without these supports (Teasdale & Bradley-Engens, 2010). Since findings such as \nMunoz-Plaza et al. (2002) indicate that social support positively contributes to LGBTQ youths’ \nlives, it may be important to understand how these youth experience social support.  \nSocial Support and Nonsupport \nStudies by Munoz-Plaza et al. (2002) and Kiperman et al. (2014) and have yielded \nqualitative findings about the supportive experiences of LGB youth. Munoz-Plaza and \ncolleagues’ (2002) findings informed who provided support to LGB youth (sources) and what \nwas provided (types). They specifically noted peers and non-family adults as being more \n65 \n \nsupportive than their family members via two primary types of support: emotional (expressions \nof love, caring, trust, listening and other similar affective behaviors) and instrumental support \n(expressions of tangible resource or aid, including money, labor, time, and barter). Participants’ \nperceived limitations to the emotional support they received from heterosexual friends to whom \nthey disclosed their sexual orientation. Participants felt their heterosexual friends could not fully \nrelate or understand their experience. LGBTQ youth also received valuable informational \n(expressions of advice or suggestions) and appraisal support (expressions of positive feedback \nor affirmation) from peers and adults who identified as LGBT. Parents were described as \nproviding minimal support related to participants’ sexual orientation.   \nMunoz-Plaza and colleagues (2002) discussed types of support consistent with the House \n(1981) model.  Kiperman and colleagues (2014) also discussed similar support types, but created \na model depicting a continuum of social support and nonsupport experiences- when in the past \nthese constructs were studied independently of one another (e.g., Munoz-Plaza et al., 2002; \nNeufeld & Harrison, 2003). In this continuum, one end reflected positive experiences of support \nand the other end depicted poor experiences, characterized by nonsupport. An example of the \ncontinuum can be depicted via opposing constructs: open-minded (support) and close-minded \n(nonsupport). In Kiperman et al. (2014), participants discussed receiving support where people \nwere open-minded and nonjudgmental (e.g., emotional support) while also discussing \nnonsupport experiences where participants viewed others as judgmental and close-minded (e.g., \nnegative perceptions).  \nKiperman et al. (2014) included nonsupport codes concurrently with support to present a \nmore complete understanding of youths’ social context, as people and/or experiences are rarely \ndiscussed as only supportive. Blumer and Murphy (2011) depicted poor provisions of social \n66 \n \nsupport and negative interactions as nonsupport. The Kiperman et al. (2014) model confirmed \nNeufeld and Harrison’s (2003) types: unmet expectations (unfulfilled offers of assistance, or \nunmet expectations in social interactions) and negative interactions (disparaging comments, and \ncriticism of one’s decisions). Kiperman and colleagues’ (2014) data analyses included an \nadditional component, negative perceptions (perceptions of others that lead participants to reduce \ntheir willingness to seek support from them) to inform experiences that were not depicted in \nNeufeld and Harrison’s (2003) nonsupport types.  \nThe Kiperman et al. (2014) model was developed using grounded theory qualitative \nmethodology where the goal was to depict perspectives of LGBTQ youth and their perspectives; \nhowever the research on which it was based did not ask directly about support and nonsupport \nand did not include gender diverse youth in the sample. Further investigation is needed to inform \nthis model’s validity and depiction of LGBTQ youth perspectives by asking directly about \nexperiences of support and nonsupport.  \nLGBTQ Youth With and Without Access to Parental Consent \nLGBTQ youth have demonstrated that one in four LGB youth have reported some type of \nparental maltreatment during their childhood (Paul & Khale, 2016) and some LGBTQ youth \nhave reported on their parents’ negative response to their coming out (Varjas, Kiperman & \nMeyers, 2016). These adverse experiences may prevent youth from wanting to ‘come out’ or \ndisclose their identity to their families in general.  Additionally, parents have been documented \nas one of the most significant relationships from which youth receive social support- which \nrelates to both positive and negative impacts on youth mental health (Rueger, Malecki, & \nDemaray, 2010).  Obtaining consent from a parent or guardian for youth under 18-years-old to \nparticipate in research is typically a mandatory research practice. Many youth may be excluded \n67 \n \nfrom research because having their parents or guardians sign a consent form would ‘out’ them \nand possibly provoke a harmful or uncomfortable experience (Valentine et al. 2001). Informed \nconsent for LGBTQ youth can be a barrier that prevents them from participating in research.  \nIt is important to include silenced voices of youth without access to parental consent \nbecause of the hardships they may encounter with their parents could lead to a significantly \ndifferent lived experience for these youth when compared to those who have access to parent \nconsent. Additionally, prior research on LGBTQ youth often depicts results based on a limited \nsample of youth with access to parent consent. Conclusions from such research should not be \nassociated with the entire population of LGBTQ youth when findings specific to those without \naccess to parental consent are unknown (e.g., Almeida et al., 2009; Kiperman et al., 2014). To \ncombat challenges of absent voices from research, the federal mandate 45 CFR 46.408(c) allows \nfor researchers to waive traditional consent and use in loco parentis procedures instead (where an \nadult- not associated with the research study, but typically from a community venue that serves \nLGBTQ youth- signs for a youth to participate in research that has minimal risk). In loco \nparentis procedures are designed to protect the rights of minors where an accepting adult figure \nis informed of youths’ involvement in a study in lieu of their parent (e.g., Varjas et al., 2008). \nSeveral studies have used in loco parentis procedures (e.g., Maguen, Armistead, & Kalichman, \n2000; Pilkington & D’Augelli, 1995; Rosario, Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2012; Rotheram-Borus, \nHunter, & Rosario, 1994; Whitbeck, Chen, Hoyt, Tyler & Johnson, 2004), where parent consent \nwas waived for youth under 18, and an adult at a Community Based Organization (CBO) served \nin loco parentis to safeguard the rights of each minor in the study. These adults have been \nreferenced as youth advocates, where they serve to verify youth participants understand their \nrights, the assent procedures, and the voluntary nature of the project. Youth advocates are \n68 \n \ntypically not active researchers, but are members of the CBO’s, know about the research project \nand can answer questions without investment in the research. Including youth without access to \nparent consent in research via alternate consent procedures affords these youth an opportunity to \nbe heard. \nRational for Study \nThis study explores the supportive and not supportive experiences of LGBTQ youth with \nand without access to parent consent from a transformative framework (Mertens, 2007). \nTransformative theory addresses social justice through culturally competent and sound research \nmethodology. The transformative framework views reality as constructed by social, political, \ncultural, economic, and racial/ethnic values where power and privilege greatly influence the \nreality and lens with which we consume and create research.    \n In a transformative framework, LGBTQ youth are valued participants as their voices \nhave previously been underrepresented in research and society. This study incorporates a \ntransformative framework by representing silenced voices, enacting sound qualitative \nmethodology, including participant groups of youth with and without access to parent consent, \ncomparing these groups to convey their unique voices, and presenting the research using their \nown quotes to convey findings.  \nAlthough there has been research regarding LGBTQ youths’ experience of support and \nnonsupport (e.g., Kiperman et al., 2014), there are two agenda items to address with the current \nstudy. First, Kiperman et al. (2014) proposed model should be confirmed or modified by \nresearch that explicitly asks about both support and nonsupport. Second, this model should \ninclude perspectives of LGBTQ youth with and without access to parent consent to compare \ntheir experience of social support and nonsupport. This study is designed to provide a richer \n69 \n \nunderstanding of Kiperman and colleagues’ (2014) model of LGB youth support and nonsupport \nexperiences by addressing the following research question: \nHow do the types of social support and nonsupport that LGBTQ youth (with and without \nparental consent) report receiving confirm, disconfirm, or extend the Kiperman et al. \n(2014) model?  \nMethod \nParticipants and Recruitment \nSample recommendations by Creswell (2002) suggested 15-20 participants for each \npresented group of people should be interviewed when using grounded theory methods. The \nresearcher recruited 42 participants to interview where one group included (n = 21) individuals \nwith parent consent and the second group included those without (n = 21). In order to participate, \nyouth needed to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., be between ages 14-17, identify as an LGBTQ \nyouth, be enrolled in any kind of high school experience, and have an email address where youth \nwould feel comfortable receiving emails pertaining to this study).  \nThe researcher utilized purposive sampling, where members who meet specific criteria \nwere sought out to be in the sample (Tongco, 2007). The primary researcher contacted more than \n32 community based organizations (CBOs) and schools who have statements or reputations of \nproviding support for the LGBTQ youth community. The majority of organizations were based \nin a major metropolitan city in the Southeast United States and others were based in metropolitan \ncities in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States. Of the 32 contacted sites, six \nsites agreed to participate in this project. Youth were invited to attend recruitment presentations \nby the researchers at the CBO’s and schools and were given flyers that described the study. The \nCBOs’ Facebook pages posted the flyers as well. The researcher attended events hosted by the \n70 \n \nCBOs’ where the study set up a recruitment table with study flyers and business cards. At these \nevents (e.g. PRIDE, Gay Straight Alliance GSA Youth Summit) youth were screened and could \nparticipate in the study immediately on site. Recruitment also occurred via snowball sampling \nwhere participants told people they knew about the study (Biernacki & Waldorf, 1981). They \nshared the primary researcher’s contact information that was on flyers posted in CBOs to their \npeers. Their peers contacted the researcher and reported hearing about the study from someone \nwho participated.

Other options youth used to identify their gender \nidentity included Genderfluid, Nonbinary/Agender, Stem, Genderqueer, Gender-nonconforming, and Nonbinary.  \n \nInstruments \n Participants completed a 20-minute survey, which was a part of a larger study, and then \napproximately an hour-long interview, where the shortest interview was 31 minutes and 48 \nseconds, the longest interview was 83 minutes and 25 seconds, and the mean interview time was \n54 minutes and 16 seconds. The semi-structured interview sought to understand how the LGBTQ \nyouth participants perceived their social support and nonsupport experiences. The main questions \nasked in the interview were: “Tell me about a time when you experienced others… supporting \nyou/ being unsupportive of you, or when others acted in an unsupportive way”; “Tell me about \nsituations that come to mind where you know others would support you if needed”; “Tell me \nabout situations that come to mind where you know others would not support you, or when you \nknow others would act in an unsupportive way”. Participants were asked, “Tell me what terms \nyou use to label your sexual orientation and gender identity. Tell me what those mean”. These \nprobes sought to understand how LGBTQ youth self identify and define their sexual orientation \n72 \n \nand gender identity. Additional probes included “tell me more about that/tell me what that \nlooked like/tell me what … means” to gain clarity and/or additional details from the participants. \nProcedures \n Research procedures were reviewed and approved by the university’s institutional review \nboard. Youth interested in participating contacted researchers via the phone number or email \naddress listed on recruitment materials. The first author conducted a scripted eligibility screening \n(See Appendix A) with these youth to ensure they met the study criteria and to identify whether \nthey had access to parent consent. The researcher also scheduled their interview and survey \nduring this call. Youth were either sent a consent form for their parents to sign before they could \nparticipate or identified a youth advocate (a designated person at each CBO that partnered with \nthis study) in lieu parent consent. Youth advocates answered questions and reviewed the research \nwith youth and did not have direct investment in the study’s outcomes. In loco parentis was \nenacted when prospective participants comprehended their involvement and posed minimal \nconcern about the study. All participants provided assent and turned in their signed forms prior to \ntheir study participation.  \nParticipants interacted with one of four research assistants for their survey and interview \nsession. Each research assistant was trained to conduct the interview and survey session by the \nfirst author in a one-on-one training with scripts, modeling, and role-playing (Bandura, 1977). \nThe scripts (Appendix B) indicated what the research assistants should say throughout the \nsession and interview, along with what probes to use. The first author modeled what a session \nshould look like for the research assistants.  \nResearchers enacted various interview procedures to help reduce power differentials and \nbuilt rapport with participants (Thornberg et al., 2012). Specifically, researchers attributed the \n73 \n \nrole of “expert” to the participant and expressed the study’s interest in conveying participant \nperspectives. Participants were told they did not have to share anything they did not want to and \ncould stop their study involvement at anytime. Researchers limited their evaluative or \njudgmental statements by reviewing transcripts to note judgmental statements and examples of \nsuccessful interview responses to foster participants’ willingness to be honest and to talk about \ntheir experience. Research assistants established and maintained rapport via open body posture, \npaying attention to participants throughout their interview via paraphrasing and summarizing \ntheir thoughts, using nonjudgmental verbal and nonverbal cues, and making casual friendly \nconversation (Kortesluoma, Hentinen, & Nikkonen, 2003; Mayall, 2008).  \nParticipants met one of these researchers at their CBO, the researcher’s university, or if \nout of state via Skype with a login created by the study. The participants met the researcher in \nperson or over Skype and were emailed a link to take the survey utilizing the Qualtrics program \n(Snow & Mann, 2013) while meeting with the research assistant. Participants opened the survey \nfrom a computer or their cell phone, assented electronically, and completed the survey.  \nResearch assistants then conducted semi-structured interviews in person or via Skype \nwith participants. Interviews were audio-recorded by the researcher assistants. Participant \ninvolvement concluded by receiving a $15.00 stipend for their time. In person, participants \nreceived $15.00 cash and signed a receipt while Skype participants were paid via PayPal or were \nmailed cash. Participants who interviewed via Skype were sent receipts with their cash for them \nto sign and return to the researcher. They would return their signed receipt via mail or via email \nas a scanned image. \nFour research assistants conducted the survey and interview sessions and six research \nassistants transcribed the audio-recorded interviews verbatim. Research assistants were provided \n74 \n \na template for the transcription and the audio recording. The first author reviewed all transcripts \nfor accuracy. The transcripts were imported into MAXQDA software, a program that manages \nqualitative data and its analysis (Saillard, 2011). \nData Analysis  \nCoding. Three research assistants (including the first author) conducted coding. Coder \none was a Caucasian school psychology graduate student, Heterosexual female; coder two was a \nmixed (Black and White) undergraduate psychology student, Gay male; and coder three was a \nBlack school psychology graduate student, Heterosexual female. These research assistants coded \ntypes of support and nonsupport that confirmed, disconfirmed or extended the types identified in \nthe Kiperman et al. (2014) model. The research assistants also coded for ways in which these \ncodes may be experienced as similar or different by LGBTQ youth with and without parental \nconsent.  Coding occurred as a recursive, inductive-deductive process where researchers \ninductively derived themes from the data reflective of the participants’ perceptions, deductively \nincorporated existing research such as the Kiperman et al (2014) model to develop additional \nthemes, recursively revisited data when ideas were amended (Glaser, 1965; Schensul, Nastasi, \n2009; Schensul, & LeCompte, 2013; Strauss & Corbin, 1990). The inductive-deductive coding \nprocess consisted of the following steps: open coding for codebook development, continued \ncodebook development, and applying the finalized codebook.  \nPhase 1: Open Coding for Codebook Development. Open coding refers to identifying and \ncategorizing main ideas in interview text by asking oneself, what is happening here or what is \nthe main idea (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Saldaña, 2013). Open coding developed from interview \ncontent rather than theory and served as the inductive content for codebook development in \nphase 2. The three research assistants conducted open coding while transcribing and reconvened \n75 \n \nweekly to discuss the following process. They compared their open codes, developed definitions \nfor these codes, agreed on applying certain open codes to similar units of data, and exposed each \nother to new open codes they had not considered in their own transcript review. Researchers \nmaintained an ongoing table with a list of the open codes, their definitions, and examples from \ntext to inform their inductive findings for codebook development. The researchers reached \nsaturation (which refers to the point at which no new ideas can be generated due to repetition of \nalready identified themes or the point at which all data has been reviewed) as they stopped \nidentifying new open codes before reviewing the final transcripts (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).  \nAlthough open coding tends to be an inductive process, the research assistants acknowledged \ntheir awareness of the study’s research question and of the existing Kiperman et al. (2014) model \nthrough this process. Researchers’ open codes also included support and nonsupport types from \nthe Kiperman et al. (2014) model, as the research questions and current study would be based on \nthis work. Thus, deductive coding occurred when researchers identified themes with which they \nwere familiar, but they also open coded for novel ideas consistent with an inductive approach. \nPhase 2: Continued Codebook Development. The second phase of data coding involved \ndeveloping a codebook with inductive and deductive concepts. Codebooks function as guides or \nmanuals to researchers that help them independently identify the same qualitative analyses \n(Bakeman & Gottman, 1986; MacQueen, McLellan, Kay & Milstein, 1998).  Codebooks \ntypically include the code name, a brief definition (to summarize the code), a full definition (to \naddress nuances), guidelines for when to apply or not apply the code, and examples (MacQueen \net al., 1998).  \nThe three research assistants were guided by consensual qualitative research (CQR) \nguidelines in codebook development (Hill, Thompson, & Williams, 1997). CQR calls for \n76 \n \nmultiple researchers working together, reaching consensus, and acknowledging the \nrepresentativeness of codes across cases. Researchers first reviewed the research question and \nconsidered what open codes from phase one were relevant. They deductively compared the open \ncodes to existing concepts and models of social support and nonsupport to yield an inductive-\ndeductive codebook. Researchers included codes that both support and contradict existing \ntheory, to account for negative case analysis, which refers to including data that may contradict \nor not support the overall data scheme (Miles & Huberman, 1994). By applying negative case \nanalysis to the data, researchers can better understand the complete experiences of participants, \nreduce their bias of looking only to confirm established theories, enhance validity of data \ninterpretation and emerging theories, and provide direction for future research (LeCompte & \nSchensul, 2013; Morse, 2015). \nCodebooks were established as reliable when researchers could independently review the \nsame transcript and yield similar codes. Prior to this process beginning researchers designated \ncoding blocks and methods for assessing interrater reliability. Coding blocks are predetermined \nsegments of text to promote reliability of coding by multiple researchers (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; \nSaldaña, 2013). For this study coding blocks were identified as entire segments when a \nparticipant speaks, beginning after the researcher stops talking and ending before a researcher \nstarts talking. An exception to this rule was when a participant’s response could only be coded \naccurately by considering the researcher’s question or probe to inform the participant’s response. \nInter-rater Agreement (IRR) refers to the extent to which coders agree, determined by \ncomparing their coding decisions to determine the percentage of coding agreements (Bakeman & \nGottman, 1986; Nastasi, 2009). IRR helps researchers develop and refine their codebooks. \nBakeman and Gottman suggest the standard 90% agreement. Researchers continued clarifying \n77 \n \nthe codebook (e.g., sharpening definitions, providing examples) until at least 90% IRR was \nattained, which occurred at transcript 10 (91.26% IRR attained). Researchers applied the \nfinalized codebook to all transcripts, including those that were coded with previous versions of \nthe codebook. The final IRR value depicts all transcripts coded with the final codebook. \nPhase 3: Applying the Finalized Codebook. The third phase involved coding data with \nthe finalized codebook while maintaining adequate reliability among coders. Each of the three \nresearch assistants were assigned a third of the transcripts to code independently, including \ntranscripts that were coded with former versions of the codebook as they were not coded with \nmost updated codebook. To address concerns of independent coding, researchers incorporated an \naccountability technique to account for possible coder drift (Bakeman & Gottman, 1986). Coder \ndrift refers to the tendency of coders to change their interpretations of the coding scheme as they \ncode independently. The researchers monitored coder drift by calculating IRR for 10% of each \nindividually coded interview (Bakeman & Gottman, 1986; Nastasi, 2009). The remaining \ninterviews were coded with 90% or higher IRR (n = 27 interviews, coder drift IRR = 92.23), \nwith a final total IRR of 91.68%. All discrepancies were discussed by researchers and compared \nto the codebook definition until 100% consensus was reached (Miles & Huberman, 1994).   \nTrustworthiness.  The current study incorporated multiple procedures to address the \ntrustworthiness of the data. Trustworthiness refers to the steps taken to ensure data validity (the \nextent to which findings are consistent and other explanations can be ruled out), reliability (the \nextent to which findings are replicable), and objectivity of researchers (limiting researcher bias \nand subjectivity) (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Miles & Huberman, 1994). The particular actions \nenacted by researchers to ensure trustworthiness included training research assistants for the \nfollowing: interview procedures (e.g., reducing power differentials, attuning to participants, and \n78 \n \nlimiting evaluative statements) (Kortesluoma et al., 2003; Mayall, 2008), bracketing researcher \nbiases (Miles & Huberman, 1994), IRR methods (Bakeman & Gottman, 1986), and developing a \ncodebook (Bakeman & Gottman, 1986; MacQueen et al., 1998). Additional methods used to \nimplement trustworthiness included an audit trail and peer debriefing (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). \nBracketing refers to a phenomenological concept that asks researchers be aware of their \nunacknowledged preconceptions that relate to the research or that may taint a researchers motive \nin their work (Saldaña, 2013). The first author had awareness of her identity as a straight female \nally of the LGBTQ youth community completing her school psychology dissertation in \nacademia. She acknowledged her transformative orientation that informs her motive to further \nsocial justice agendas for this community as a limit that could skew her interviewing, \ninterpretation, and reporting.  The research team was trained to enact bracketing to account for \ntheir unique lens during live interviews and data analysis phases of research. Two of the three \nadditional research assistants identified as straight female allies of the LGBTQ youth community \nand were seeking their school psychology specialist degree at the time of their involvement. The \nthird research assistant identified as Gay male and an ally of the LGBTQ youth community.  He \nwas an undergraduate student who ran an LGBTQ youth group in the Southeast United States. \nSome ways in which the research team attempted to bracket involved using participants’ own \nwords when probing in interviews. Using participants own words is considered bracketing, as \nusing similar words denotes being on a similar page regardless of external circumstances or \npreconceptions (e.g., unique values or experiences).  \nThe researchers who coded and conducted interviews enacted audit trails (Lincoln & \nGuba, 1985) that included detailed documentation of procedures including data gathering and \ncoding. The audit trails included detailed summary of each interview with specific regard for \n79 \n \nparticipant affect or unique qualities (e.g., one participant stated they had autism, which was \nnoted in the audit trail), changes made to the interview protocol, and each version of the \ndeveloped codebook with notes indicating where revisions were made. The researchers who \nengaged in each step of the study maintained audit trails.  \nPeer debriefing refers to the review of data and research process by someone familiar \nwith the research or phenomena being explored (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). The first author’s \nfaculty advisors engaged in peer debriefing with the first author as experts in the methodology. \nOne of the faculty advisors is a female full-professor in school psychology, who identifies with a \ntransformative research framework, and actively advocates for the LGBTQ youth community. \nThe second faculty advisor is a male Regents’ professor in school psychology whose research \naddresses consultation, marginalized populations, and preventative mental health services in \nschools.  They supported the first author by questioning her assumptions and interpretations. \nPeer debriefing among the first author and faculty advisors was an ongoing process from study \ndevelopment, data collection, data analysis and interpretation and dissemination. \nPeer debriefing also occurred between the first author and the research assistant with \nwhom she transcribed and coded. Their debriefing typically involved discussions of what \ninformation they hoped to convey via findings from their research. The researcher also engaged \nin peer debriefing following each time a research assistant conducted an interview to review their \nexperience and prepare them for future interactions with participants.  These debriefings \noccurred as either in-person or over the phone as conversations. \nResults \nThe results of this study are structured to inform the study’s research question: How do \nsocial support and nonsupport experiences of LGBTQ youth (with and without parental consent) \n80 \n \nconfirm, disconfirm, or extend the Kiperman et al. (2014) model? These coding schemes are \npresented in Figures 2.2 and 2.3 where coding schemes for social support and nonsupport actions \nare depicted in Figure 2.1, and social support and nonsupport descriptions are in Figure 2.2. The \nfollowing analysis includes 4 level 1 codes: social support actions, social nonsupport actions, \nsocial support descriptions and social nonsupport descriptions. Each level 1 code and their \nsubcodes are discussed in the following results sections. Codes and subcodes are illustrated with \ndirect quotes from participants. Prevalence of codes and subcodes are reported by including the \nfrequency and percent of the sample that discussed each. Each code has a sentence that discusses \nhow codes confirm, disconfirm and extend the Kiperman et al. (2014) model. \n In exploring how experiences of youth with and without parent consent may be similar or \ndifferent, similarities were noted as participants discussing the same social support and \nnonsupport, allowing researchers use one codebook/series of codes to guide the results for each \npopulation. Differences were documented as frequency variations, where youth with parent \nconsent reported experiencing social support/nonsupport actions and descriptions more or less \nfrequently than youth without access to parent consent. These findings are discussed last in the \nresults section and are depicted in Table 2.2. \n81 \n \nSocial Support Actions (Level 1) \nSocial Support actions were coded to depict ways participants perceive receiving support \nfrom others.  Social support actions included the following level 2 codes: emotional, appraisal, \nand tangible/instrumental. The code, tangible/instrumental contained the level 3 code, \ninformational. These codes are presented in Figure 2.3 and are defined and discussed below. \nEmotional (Level 2). Emotional support was coded when participants perceived groups \nor individuals as providing them with warmth, nurturance, assurance or an opportunity to talk \n(i.e., expressions of empathy, love, ‘you matter’). Emotional support was further defined based \nFigure 2.1 Coding Hierarchy: Social Support and Nonsupport Actions \n82 \n \non motives to foster warmth between the participant and others. Findings confirm emotional \nsupport as support LGBTQ youth perceive receiving. Emotional support was reported by \n97.62% of participants (n = 20/21 with parent consent; n = 21/21 with in loco parentis consent). \nA 14-year-old White female who was Bisexual and used in loco parentis consent procedures \nreported her girlfriend as providing emotional support as follows: “Well she is willing to be seen \nwith me and put her arm around me in public or like that. She’ll tell people… She will be like, \n‘this is my girlfriend, I’m proud to be with her’, and I do the same thing with her”. A 16-year-\nold, White, female, participant who identified as Lesbian and had parent consent shared the \nfollowing about her girlfriend:  \n“…She knows me inside and out, like completely, like if we’re Skyping, and I’m doing \nhomework - and that’s often what happens because we Skype every single day. […] You \nwould think that at that time, when you’re at your lowest and you feel like you’re gonna \ndo something stupid, […] you think […] someone needs to hold me down, or hug me, or \nwipe my tears for me, or be the shoulder that I cry on, but she completely was, without \nbeing there physically, and that’s what’s really beautiful about the situation”. \nAppraisal (Level 2). Appraisal support was coded to depict a participant’s perception that \ngroups or individuals provided them with evaluations that either enhanced their self-perceptions, \nfacilitated their accomplishments/identity development, or gave constructive feedback that was \nexperienced positively. Appraisal support was coded when motives were to offer guidance, \nrather than fostering the emotional connection. Findings disconfirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) \nmodel’s depiction of affirmation, as the article explicitly noted constructive feedback as not \nbeing identified as supportive. This study includes appraisal support, as a support LGBTQ youth \nperceive receiving. Several participants reported experiencing appraisal support (71.43%) (n = \n83 \n \n16 parent consent; n = 14 in loco parentis). A 16-year-old Hispanic participant who identified as \nGenderfluid and Pansexual and used in loco parentis consent procedures reported the following \nexperience of appraisal: “I had a […] Spanish teacher, she was just so nice and so supportive. \nWhen I did come out to her, she was respectful of it and she said it doesn’t matter to me who you \nare because you are a good person and that is was matters”. Another example of appraisal \nsupport was stated by a 17-year-old White Pansexual female with parent consent who stated:                    \n“I was at a friend’s house, and we were being stupid teenagers and we were drinking and \nsmoking and I was supposed to drive home. And I was like ‘I don’t know what to do [… \nso I called by brother and he said] ‘You’re making bad decisions and I want you to make \ngood decisions. So either you are going to stay there or you are going to walk home’. So I \nwalked home, I walked home and um when I got home, my brother […] just like made \nme feel better about myself because when I sat on the couch, he stood in front of me, and \nsaid ‘Listen, you’re not allowed to make these decisions’. And just, ever since that night \nhe has made sure that everything I do is always something that I will have a plan and I’ll \nhave some way to help myself”.  \nTangible/instrumental (level 2). Tangible/Instrumental support was coded when \nparticipants perceived groups or individuals as providing them with goods, services, help, or \nassistance (not inclusive of feedback- which was coded as appraisal). Such tangible/instrumental \nsupport could include mentorship, advocacy, fiscal assistance, shelter, car rides, etc.  \nTangible/instrumental support was reported by 83.33% of participants (n = 19 parent consent; n \n= 16 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model to include \ntangible/instrumental support, as a support LGBTQ youth perceive receiving. A 15-year-old \nWhite female who identifies as Bisexual and used in loco parentis consent procedures reported \n84 \n \ntangible/instrumental support as the following from her stepmom: “She’s taking me to go to a bi \nparade or a Pride Parade. […] She takes me there and she will sit there and cheer on with me or \nhold my hand and be right next to me and go watch the parade”.  A 16-year-old, White \nparticipant who identified their gender as “other”, was heterosexual, and who used parent \nconsent reported the following experience of tangible/instrumental support:  \n“I hate thinking this, but I’m one of the lucky ones. […] I might not always be the most \naccepting of their [my parents] love and returning it, but […] at the end of the day, I have \na bed to sleep on, that I know I can come back to, if I go and do drugs or alcohol I have \nsomeone I can call for a ride. Not that I’m saying I will. \nInformational (level 3): Informational support was coded as a subtype of \ntangible/instrumental as receiving information was considered a service/help others provided. \nInformational support refers to participants’ perception that groups or individuals provided them \nwith new, helpful knowledge or advice to address problems, questions or knowledge gaps. \nInformational support was reported by 57.14% of participants (n = 13 parent consent; n = 11 in \nloco parentis). Findings extend the Kiperman et al. (2014) model to include informational \nsupport, as a support within tangible/instrumental support that LGBTQ youth reported receiving. \nA 17-year-old, White female to male Transgender participant who identified as Pansexual and \nused parent consent reported his friends as providing the following informational support:  \n“Um, they sent me, like, um, resources that help, um, help you find labels for yourself. \nThey, uh, sent me positivity quotes and stuff, and they, uh, also since I’ve been come, \nlike, coming out as Trans, they’ve sent me a lot of, um, resources as well, especially for \ntransition and finding doctors”.   \n85 \n \nSocial Nonsupport Actions (Level 1) \nSocial Nonsupport actions were coded to depict ways in which participants perceive not \nbeing supported by others.  Social nonsupport actions included the following level 2 codes: \nunmet expectations, appraisal, tangible/instrumental, and negative interactions. The code, unmet \nexpectation contained the level 3 codes, no follow through and emotional; while the code \ntangible/instrumental contained the level 3 code informational; and the code negative \ninteractions contained the level 3 subcodes verbal, physical, relational, and cyberbullying. These \ncodes are presented in Figure 2.3 and are defined and discussed below. \nUnmet expectations (level 2). Unmet expectations were coded when participants reported \ngroups or individuals as not meeting their expectations or when the participants preferred that \nothers act differently than they did. Unmet expectations were reported by 80.95% of participants \n(n = 18 parent consent; n = 16 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) \nmodel to include unmet expectations, as a nonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving. A 17-\nyear-old, White Transgender (female to male) participant who identified as Pansexual and used \nparent consent reported having the following experience of an unmet expectation:  \n“Uh, I mean, it, whenever people use the wrong pronouns or, like, assume that I’m just, \nyou know, a girl and don’t even really think anything of it, uh, it makes me feel kinda \ndisappointed, I’m just, like, “Uh huh!” It’s not even worth the fight, though, most of the \ntime. It’s not worth correcting people, because you never know how they’re gonna be on \nthat, and if they aren’t completely okay with that then you’re gonna end up having a ten \nminute discussion with your grocery clerk, and that’s just, it’s not fun”.   \n86 \n \nAnother participant who was 14 years old, White, Genderfluid, Pansexual, and who had parent \nconsent reported the following unmet expectation from a religious facility: “I went there for a \npositive service, and all I got was negativity.”  \n No follow through (level 3). Researchers coded no follow through when participants \nreported groups or individuals as not following through on an explicitly stated previous \ncommitment they made to the participant.  No follow through was reported by 30.95% of \nparticipants (n = 7 parent consent; n = 6 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the Kiperman et al. \n(2014) model to include no follow through, as a nonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving. A \n17-year-old, White Transgender (female to male) participant who identified as Pansexual and \nused parent consent reported no follow through as the following: “Oh, my God. My principal. \nDead names me ALL the time. Dead name’s when you call someone, um, uh, by the name that \nthey were given at birth, and not necessarily the one that they, um, have told you ten-thousand \ntimes that they wanna be called.”  \n Emotional (level 3). Emotional nonsupport was coded when participants perceived \ngroups or individuals as not providing emotional support when it is expected. Emotional \nnonsupport was coded when explicit statements of others not caring about the participant or \ndisowning them were discussed. Emotional nonsupport was reported by 66.67% of participants \n(n = 13 parent consent; n = 15 in loco parentis). Findings extend the Kiperman et al. (2014) \nmodel to include emotional nonsupport, as a nonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving. A 14-\nyear-old female of mixed race, who identified as female and Pansexual, who used in loco \nparentis consent procedures reported emotional nonsupport as the following: “[When my sister \nwears headphones] it feels like they are not actually listening to you, like they are listening, but \nat the same time they don’t care enough to give you attention”.   \n87 \n \nAppraisal (level 2). Appraisal nonsupport was coded when participants perceived groups \nor individuals provided evaluations that either hurt their self-perceptions, degraded their \naccomplishments, or gave feedback that was experienced negatively. Appraisal nonsupport was \nreported by 71.43% of participants (n = 15 parent consent; n = 15 in loco parentis). Findings \nextend the Kiperman et al. (2014) model to include appraisal nonsupport, as a nonsupport \nLGBTQ youth report receiving. A 14-year-old White female participant who identified as \nbisexual and used in loco parentis consent procedures reported experiencing appraisal as the \nfollowing: “My mom told me that I am too young to know what I am, like parents usually say… \nthat I am too young to know what I am and she expresses that she doesn’t’ like [my girlfriend] \ncause she knows we are in a relationship, so she doesn’t support it”.   \nTangible/instrumental (level 2). Tangible/instrumental nonsupport was coded when \nparticipants perceived that groups or individuals provided goods services or assistance in ways \nthat devalued their identity or was experienced negatively. Tangible/instrumental nonsupport \nwas reported by 42.86% of participants (n = 10 parent consent; n = 8 in loco parentis). Findings \nextend the Kiperman et al. (2014) model to include tangible/instrumental nonsupport, as a \nnonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving. A 14-year-old White female who identified as \nBisexual and used in loco parentis consent procedures reported tangible/instrumental as the \nfollowing:  \n“She’s tried to force it on me, like when I thought I was male she tried to force femininity \non me, she would get me make up and try to take me to church and her church is like \nvery strict because males wear suits and women wear dresses. I don’t mind wearing a \ndress, but I don’t want to be forced into wearing a dress, and she tried to force me. She \ndefinitely tried to force me to do my nails and wear make up and yeah”.   \n88 \n \n Informational (level 3). Informational nonsupport was coded when participants perceived \nthat groups or individuals provided new knowledge or advice that devalued their identity, \nconflicted with their beliefs/identity, or was experienced in a negative way. Informational \nnonsupport was reported by 35.71% of participants (n = 8 parent consent; n = 7 in loco parentis). \nFindings extend the Kiperman et al. (2014) model to include informational nonsupport, as a \nnonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving. A 17-year-old White female who identified as \nLesbian and had parent consent reported informational nonsupport as the following:  \n“It was bad. Um, he talked about how he had all these gay friends and they lived the gay \nlifestyle and a lot of them decided to change their lifestyle and now they’re really happy \nand umm yeah. That’s what he said I mean he was like they decided that they wanted to \nchange their gay lifestyle like he was saying they converted like into being straight. Like \nto enlighten me I don’t know maybe he was like ‘she’s so young, maybe she can \nchange’”.   \nNegative Interactions (level 2). Negative Interactions was coded when participants \nperceived groups or individuals as engaging in negative acts against them, which typically \nappeared as bullying either online or in person. Negative interactions could include exclusion \nbullying, hurtful comments/verbal abuse, or spreading rumors. Level 3 subcodes of negative \ninteractions included verbal, physical, relational, and cyberbullying. Negative Interactions was \nreported by 71.43% of participants (n = 15 parent consent; n = 15 in loco parentis). Findings \nconfirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model to include negative interactions, as a nonsupport \nLGBTQ youth report receiving. One 14-year-old youth who identified as a Gay White male and \nused parent consent reported that he experienced the following as negative interactions from his \nclassmates:  \n89 \n \n“During class, they would like to pull pranks on me, they would try to get me in trouble, \nthey would like… we weren’t allowed to have our phones at school but we could like \nhave them in our backpacks. And um, people would take my phone and try to put it on \nthe ground where the teacher was standing to try to get me in trouble”.  \n Verbal (level 3). Verbal negative interactions was coded when participants perceived that \ngroups or individuals verbally insulted them with homophobic or general slurs, verbal abuse, \nhurtful comments, criticism, curse words, or threats in person or in writing (not electronic). \nVerbal was reported by 80.95% of participants (n = 17 parent consent; n = 17 in loco parentis). \nFindings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction of verbal nonsupport, as a \nnonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 16-year-old participant who identified as White, \nLesbian, and female who used parent consent reported verbal negative interactions as the \nfollowing: “There was this gym teacher last year that like didn’t, that like checked all the girls \nout and hit on ‘em, and eventually I spoke up and uh, he ended up calling me a faggot, cause I \ntold him that he needs to respect women”.  Anther youth who was 15 years old and identified as \nHispanic, Genderqueer (when people do not subscribe to conventional gender distinctions but \nidentifies with neither, both, or a combination of male and female genders), and Pansexual \n(attraction preference is not limited with regard to biological sex, gender or gender identity) who \nhad parent consent shared the following from her school-based peers:  \n“Uh I was in class with them and uh, I think the day it started was when I was walking \ndown the hallway and they were like “hey fat ass, what’s up?” and I was like “what?” \nAnd then like it continued happening, and I think it got a little more serious when they \nwere like “oh you should just go kill yourself” like “I don’t even know why you’re here,” \nand honestly its just stupid”.  \n90 \n \nPhysical (level 3). Physical negative interactions was coded when participants perceived \nthat groups or individuals physically assaulted participants (e.g., hit, kick, punch, push). Physical \nwas reported by 21.43% of participants (n = 3 parent consent; n = 6 in loco parentis). Findings \nconfirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction of a physical negative interaction, as a \nnonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 17-year-old Hispanic participant who identified \nas Transgender (female to male) and Gay who used in loco parentis consent procedures reported \nphysical negative interactions as the following:  \n“Yeah my mom’s best friend said she thought I was my step dad’s daughter for a second \nand she started going off on me and I told my mom I wanted her out of the house. My \nmom got her out of the house but my mom was mad that I told her that so she grabbed me \nby my shirt and she hit my back a few times and I turned around to look at her and she \ngave me a bloody nose. And she made me clean it up afterwards too”.   \nAn example of physical negative interactions occurring in school was mentioned by a 15-year-\nold White, Bisexual Female who used in loco parentis consent procedures: “My peers make fun \nof me because of they know … that I’m bisexual and um … that they would try to hurt me you \nknow sometimes physically you know hit me on my back or try to trip me up or anything like \nthat”.  \nRelational (level 3). Relational negative interactions were coded when participants \nperceived groups or individuals as targeting them through exclusion or rumor spreading. \nRelational negative interactions were reported by 21.43% of participants (n = 5 parent consent; n \n= 4 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction of \nrelational negative interactions, as a nonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 14-year-old \n91 \n \nWhite, Genderfluid, Pansexual youth who used parent consent reported relational negative \ninteractions as the following:  \n“These guys said ‘you’re actually a cool person but I can’t talk to you when other people \nare around because we don’t want to be made fun of’. I mean, I don’t even know how it \nstarted. It was just something that someone made up. And then, I got surrounded so fast \nthat I had no friends and even new people were coming to school, people would tell them \nabout me. I had no friends. A bunch of other stuff spread off of that, so it was, there were \nso many things”.   \nCyberbullying (level 3). Cyberbullying was coded when participants perceived groups or \nindividuals as targeting them through electronic means of bullying. Cyberbullying was reported \nby 2.38% of participants (n = 0 parent consent; n = 1 in loco parentis). Findings extend the \nKiperman et al. (2014) model’s by depicting cyberbullying negative interactions, as a nonsupport \nLGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 15-year-old White Bisexual Female who used in loco parentis \nconsent procedures reported cyberbullying as the following:  \n“These people [on social media] Facebook, Kik, and Instagram, they were like stuck up \nyou know they did not really care if you try to talk to them or spend time with them, \nthey.. they wouldn’t give a crap about you. …Um they would say if you know you’re \nbisexual or transsexual or any kind of sexual, you know you should go and kill yourself \nand you know telling me things like that”.  \n92 \n \nSocial Support Descriptions (Level 1) \nSocial support descriptions (Level 1) was coded to depict how participants perceived the \nmannerisms or traits of those who provided support to them (description-based, rather than \naction based like support actions).  Social support descriptions included the following level 2 \ncodes: open-minded/nonjudgmental, connected, available, sameness, unconditional regard, and \ngenuine/authentic. The coding hierarchy is depicted in Figure 2.2 with social nonsupport \ndescriptions. \nOpen-mindedness/nonjudgmental (level 2). Open-minded/nonjudgmental support was \nFigure 2.2 Coding Hierarchy: Social Support and Nonsupport \nDescriptions \n93 \n \ncoded when participants perceived groups or individuals as being able to talk about anything, in \na nonjudgmental way, not caring about the participant’s identity. Open-\nmindedness/nonjudgmental support was reported by 85.71% of participants (n = 20 parent \nconsent; n = 16 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction \nof open-mindedness/nonjudgmental, as a support LGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 17-year-old \nBlack, Nonbinary Lesbian who had parent consent reported open-mindedness/nonjudgmental \nsupport from her parents:  \n“They like, we have like open communication about it. Like, if they have questions, they \nask me. Sometimes their questions are a lil ignorant, but I mean they are just trying to \nfigure it out. Cuz they don’t know much about it. Cuz like it was never taught and no one \nknows really”.   \nConnected (level 2).  Connected support was coded when participants perceived groups \nor individuals as understanding them. Connected support was reported by 73.81% of participants \n(n = 16 parent consent; n = 15 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) \nmodel’s depiction of connected support, as a support LGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 17-year-\nold, White Pansexual female with parent consent reported feeling connected as the following: \n“She and I have been in such similar situations our whole lives, that she can just understand me \nand I can understand her really easily. […] And it’s like middle school girls. I don’t know she is \njust pretty important”.  In this example, being similar does not refer to their sexuality or gender \nidentity, so it was not coded as sameness.  \nAvailable (level 2). Available support was coded when participants perceived groups or \nindividuals as being available, “always being there” or as going out of their way to be present for \nthe participant. Available support was reported by 50% of participants (n = 10 parent consent; n \n94 \n \n= 11 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction of \navailable support, as a support LGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 15-year-old, White Gay male \nwho used in loco parentis consent procedures reported available as the following from his sister: \n“Ya know, like if I text her and say hey can we talk, she’s like sure even if she’s at work she’ll \nmake a few minutes to just sit down and talk to me and ask what’s going on and how can she \nhelp”.   \nSameness (level 2). Sameness support was coded when participants perceived groups or \nindividuals as having an LGBTQ+ identity that is viewed as a shared experience. Sameness \nsupport was reported by 78.57% of participants (n = 18 parent consent; n = 15 in loco parentis). \nFindings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction of sameness, as a support \nLGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 15-year-old White Lesbian female who used in loco parentis \nconsent procedures discussed sameness support in the following manner: “I have some friends \nthat are gay that are supportive of course. They know what I’m going through and like what’s \nhappening and like how I feel. So they know like exactly what to say and if we want to talk \nabout it, they know. It’s just really good to have other people like you”.   \nUnconditional regard (level 2).  Unconditional regard was coded when participants \nperceived groups or individuals as loving them no matter what, doing anything for them, or still \ncaring despite presented conditions (e.g., disclosure of one’s sexual orientation). Unconditional \nregard was reported by 54.76% of participants (n = 12 parent consent; n = 11 in loco parentis). \nFindings extend the Kiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction to include unconditional regard, \nas a support LGBTQ youth report receiving.   A 14-year-old Lesbian Hispanic female who used \nin loco parentis consent procedures reported unconditional regard as the following:  \n95 \n \n“Um, because um, even though [my mom and I have] been through like, some situations \nbefore, um, she’s always stood by me even though there’s always been like, I’m getting \nkind of off-track here laughter but like she, she’s just always by my side and she’s \nalways defending me no matter what”.   \nGenuine/authentic (level 2). Genuine/authentic support was coded when participants \nperceived groups or individuals as being honest or real. Genuine/authentic support was reported \nby 30.95% of participants (n = 9 parent consent; n = 4 in loco parentis). Findings extend the \nKiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction to include genuine/authentic, as a support LGBTQ \nyouth report receiving.  A 16-year-old White Lesbian female with parent consent reported \ngenuine/authentic support as: “I think [our GSA] is […] most definitely more […] honest and \n[people can] be truthful about how they’re feeling. And it does mean a lot because I don’t have a \nlot of people that are like super close to me in my life”.   \nTrustworthy (level 2). Trustworthy support was coded when participants perceived \ngroups or individuals as people to whom they could confide. Trustworthy support was reported \nby 33.33% of participants (n = 8 parent consent; n = 6 in loco parentis). Findings extend the \nKiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction to include trustworthy support, as a support LGBTQ \nyouth report receiving.  A 16-year-old youth who identifies as Nonbinary/Agender Pansexual \nand White who used in loco parentis consent procedures reported trustworthy support as the \nfollowing: “Well we’ve known each other for like over four years now we talk, we talk like \nevery single day, so I trust him with like everything and he trusts me too”.   \nSocial Nonsupport Descriptions (Level 1) \nSocial nonsupport descriptions (Level 1) were coded to depict how participants perceived \nthe mannerisms or traits of those who provided nonsupport to them (description-based, rather \n96 \n \nthan action based like nonsupport actions). Social nonsupport descriptions included the \nfollowing level 2 codes: close-minded/judgmental, limited connection, unavailable, \nuntrustworthy, and homophobic. These codes are presented in Figure 2.2 and are defined and \ndiscussed below. \nClose-minded/judgmental (level 2). Close-minded/judgmental nonsupport was coded \nwhen participants perceived groups or individuals as having a limited understanding and \nunwillingness to acknowledge new/different perspectives. Close-minded/judgmental was also \ndescribed as people being stuck in their ways or as being condescending. Close-\nminded/judgmental was reported by 85.71% of participants (n = 18 parent consent; n = 18 in loco \nparentis). Findings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction of close-\nmindedness/judgmental, as a nonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 16-year-old youth \nwho identified as Hispanic, Pansexual and Genderfluid and used in loco parentis consent \nprocedures reported close-minded/judgmental support as:  \n“There are times when I don’t feel comfortable like peering out of my window, like my \nblinds are always shut and I haven’t really come out to anybody in my neighborhood. It’s \njust uncomfortable because I just don’t feel like I can really express myself and be myself \nwithout feeling like this constant judgment”.   \nA 14-year-old who identified as a White, Lesbian female and had parent consent reported of \npeople in her neighborhood:  \n“If they don't know me, they're judging the way I look because I have short hair and I \ndon't dress in a very feminine way so they could be judging me based upon that and \nmaking assumptions that I'm not like them. Assumptions that I'm not a good person or \n97 \n \nI'm going to try to turn them and make them identify with how I identify. They're going \nto assume my identity and judge me and think that I'm a terrible person”.  \nLimited Connection (level 2).  Limited connection was coded when participants \nperceived others as not understanding or getting them. Limited connection was reported by \n61.90% of participants (n = 11 parent consent; n = 15 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the \nKiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction of limited connection, as a nonsupport LGBTQ youth \nreport receiving.  A 16-year-old White Bisexual female who used in loco parentis consent \nprocedures reported limited connection as: “Um, I avoid a lot of things with a lot of people \nbecause they don’t know-- like I don’t know how to come out to them. I don’t know how they’re \ngonna react”.  The same youth reported of her grandmother, “I mean my grandmother’s always \nbeen really supportive of me, it’s just that her roommate really isn’t that supportive, like her \nroommate doesn’t understand what it’s like to be bisexual”.  \nUnavailable (level 2). Unavailable nonsupport was coded when participants perceived \nothers as being notably less present than they would like. Unavailable nonsupport was reported \nby 42.86% of participants (n = 8 parent consent; n = 10 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the \nKiperman et al. (2014) model’s depiction of unavailable nonsupport, as a nonsupport LGBTQ \nyouth report receiving.  A 15-year-old Black Lesbian Female who used in loco parentis consent \nprocedures reported unavailable nonsupport as the following:  \n“My dad doesn't live with me, he lives in Florida with his other family. So like he'll like \nwe really only like talk about school… We don't really talk about my personal life. Like, \nwe used to talk everyday but now we talk like maybe twice a week after school \nparticipant wipes a tear”.   \n98 \n \nUntrustworthy (level 2). Untrustworthy nonsupport was coded when participants \nperceived others as people to whom they would not confide due to prior breaching of trust or \nassumed limitations in their ability to trust. Untrustworthy nonsupport was reported by 28.57% \nof participants (n = 6 parent consent; n = 6 in loco parentis). Findings extend the Kiperman et al. \n(2014) model to include untrustworthy, as a nonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 14-\nyear-old White Genderfluid, Pansexual youth with parent consent reported an example of her dad \nas untrustworthy as the following: “My dad doesn’t support me in so many ways. He lies and \nsays ‘you have to do something’ and then he says ‘I just don’t care’. Its like, distrust, and I don’t \nfeel like if you have distrust with someone if they actually care, or that they will be there for \nyou”.   \nHomophobic (level 2). Homophobic nonsupport was coded when participants perceived \nothers as being explicitly hateful/judgmental or condescending of the LGBTQ community, where \nexplicit reference to homophobia is made. Homophobic was reported by 50% of participants (n = \n10 parent consent; n = 11 in loco parentis). Findings confirm the Kiperman et al. (2014) model’s \ndepiction of homophobic nonsupport, as a nonsupport LGBTQ youth report receiving.  A 15-\nyear-old White Bisexual male who used in loco parentis consent procedures reported his \ngrandparents presenting with homophobia as follows: “I haven’t told them. They don’t know that \nI’m, uh, I’m Bisexual. Neither does my, uh, mother. Uh, they’re homophobic and I’m living at \ntheir house. I would fear that they would kick me out. That would, that would really suck”.  \nYouth with and without Access to Parent Consent: Comparisons in their Experiences \nComparing the two sample groups of youth with and without parent consent were \nconducted in two ways: (1) identifying whether they endorse similar constructs related to their \nexperience of social support/nonsupport actions and descriptions; and (2) using frequency counts \n99 \n \nto inform how many people from each sample groups endorsed specific social \nsupport/nonsupport actions and description.  The researchers’ analyses identified the participants \nas discussing the actions and descriptions of social support and nonsupport similarly. This \nfinding allowed the researchers to apply the same codebook used to inform Figures 2.1, 2.2, and \n2.3.  \nThe researchers used frequency counts to compare the experiences of youth with and \nwithout parent consent and are presented in Table 2.2. Results in this section are descriptive due \nusing frequency counts. While both sample groups contained 21 participants (parent consent n = \n21; youth advocate- youth without parent consent- n = 21), comparing the different frequency \ncounts of each are not generalizable and should be interpreted with caution.  \nTable 2.2 Participant Overall Report: Social Support/Nonsupport Actions and Descriptions by Parent Consent \n(youth with and without)- Frequency (Percent) \n Parent Consent \nn  \nYouth Advocate  \nn \nTotal \nn (%) \nSocial Support Actions    \n  Emotional 20 21  41 (92%) \n  Appraisal 16 14 30 (71.43%) \n  Tangible/Instrumental 19 16 35 (83.33%) \n  Informational 13 11 24 (57.14%) \n    \nSocial Nonsupport Actions    \n  Unmet Expectations 18 16 34 (80.95%) \n  No Follow Through 7 6 13 (30.95%) \n  Emotional 13 15 28 (66.67%) \n  Appraisal 15 15 30 (71.43%) \n  Tangible/Instrumental 10 8 18 (42.86%) \n  Informational 8 7 15 (35.71% \n  Negative Interactions 15 15 30 (71.43%) \n  Verbal 17 17 34 (80.95%) \n  Physical 3 6 9 (21.43%) \n  Relational 5 4 9 (21.43%) \n  Cyberbullying 0 1 1 (2.38%) \n    \nSocial Support Descriptions    \n  Open-minded/ Nonjudgmental 20 16 36 (85.71%) \n  Connected 16 15 31 (73.81%) \n  Available 10 11 21 (50%) \n  Sameness 18 15 33 (78.57%) \n  Unconditional Regard 12 11 23 (54.76%) \n  Genuine/Authentic 9 4 13 (30.95%) \n  Trustworthy 8 6 14 (33.33%) \n    \n100 \n \nSocial Nonsupport Descriptions    \n  Close-minded/ Judgmental 18 18 36 (85.71%) \n  Limited Connection  11 15 26 (61.90%) \n  Unavailable  8 10 18 (42.86%) \n  Untrustworthy 6 6 12 (28.57%) \n  Homophobic 10 11 21 (50%) \n \nFrequency counts were similar among youth with and without parent consent. \nResearchers elected to consider a difference of four or more between the two sample’s \nfrequencies as worth reporting. The codes where frequency differences were four or greater \namong each sample were: Social Nonsupport Description code, Limited Connection (PC n = 11; \nYA n = 15) and Social Support Description code, Open-minded/Nonjudgmental (PC n = 20; YA n \n= 16).  \nDiscussion \nIn pursuing further development of the Kiperman et al. (2014) model of a social support \nand nonsupport continuum, this investigation established multiple findings that confirmed, \ndisconfirmed, and extended it. Codes within the Kiperman et al. (2014) social support and \nnonsupport model that were confirmed and retained were originated from the House (1981) \nsupport themes: emotional, information, tangible/instrumental; and the Neufeld and Harrison’s \n(2003) nonsupport themes of unmet expectations and negative interactions. Within the Neufeld \nand Harrison’s (2003) nonsupport negative interaction themes, subcodes: verbal, physical, and \nrelational were confirmed. Additional social support codes confirmed included: open-\nmindedness/nonjudgmental, connected, available, and sameness. Social nonsupport codes \nconfirmed included: No follow through, close-minded/judgmental, limited connection, \nunavailable, and homophobic. The confirmation of the previous codes indicate that youth with \nand without parent consent discussed these constructs as part of their experience of social \n101 \n \nsupport and nonsupport from others similarly to those youth from the Kiperman et al. (2014) \nmodel. \nA finding that disconfirmed the Kiperman et al. (2014) model in this study involved \nusing the social support code, appraisal rather than affirmation as indicated by the previous \nstudy. Munoz-Plaza et al.’s (2002) and Kiperman et al.’s (2014) articles documented affirming \nresponses as supportive, and did not reference critical feedback. Despite House’s (1981) \ndepiction of appraisal as support, the Kiperman et al. (2014) replaced this concept with \naffirmation since affirmation depicts the experience of being affirmed by others rather than \nreceiving critical feedback. Nevertheless, youth in this sample discussed critical feedback as a \nhelpful experience (e.g., being told they were making bad choices or that they are hanging out \nwith the ‘wrong crowd’ where they were guided to self reflect on their choices), which could \nindicate the validity of conceptualizing appraisal as including critical feedback and not limiting it \nto affirmative statements. Thus, the current study and House (1981) reference appraisal, which \nincludes critical feedback as a supportive feature.  \nSeveral findings extended findings from the Kiperman et al. (2014) model. Social support \ncodes were added to the current study and include: unconditional regard, genuine/authentic, and \ntrustworthy. These codes were not mentioned in the Kiperman et al. (2014) model, but were \ndiscussed by several participants in this study as a part of their supportive experiences, and were \ntherefore included as support codes.   \nCodes that were added to the current study, which also extended findings of the \nKiperman et al. (2014) model included: emotional, appraisal, tangible/instrumental, and \ninformational. These codes depict nonsupport experiences that were initially only conveyed as \nsupport codes from the House (1981). By depicting these concepts as both supportive and not \n102 \n \nsupportive, the researchers informed how one construct can be experienced in both positive to \nnegative ways.   \nAdditional nonsupport codes included that extend findings include the subcode, \ncyberbullying of negative interactions. Cyberbullying was discussed by youth in this sample and \nare considered a type of bullying similar to verbal, physical, and relational. Cyberbullying was \nincluded to comprehensively depict the experiences of negative interactions. Untrustworthy was \nalso added as a nonsupport code, to depict the negative, nonsupportive, opposing experiences of \nLGBTQ youth when compared to trustworthy support. Including the code, untrustworthy helped \nconvey how the concept of trust could be perceived as both supportive (trustworthy) and not \nsupportive (untrustworthy).  \nThis study further extended the Kiperman et al. (2014) model, where it revised the \nconcepts of support and nonsupport types by parsing them into support and nonsupport actions \nand descriptions. In the Kiperman et al. (2014, p. 79) article, types was defined as “when \nparticipants perceived someone or a group as having a positive [or negative] impact or \ninteraction based on verbal or nonverbal cues”. The researchers accounted for the broad \ndefinition of support and nonsupport types and posit two distinct codes that could inform this \nchapter’s model (i.e. actions and descriptions) in Figure 2.3. Codes such as emotional and \ninformational social support or unmet expectations of nonsupport depicted actions enacted by \npeople to the participant. Researchers included support codes such as open-\nmindedness/nonjudgmental and nonsupport codes like close-minded/judgmental as descriptions, \nwhich depicted participants’ descriptions of people providing support or of the support bring \nprovided.  While these codes were all discussed as support and nonsupport types within the \nKiperman et al. (2014) model, the current chapter developed two distinct groups of codes to \n103 \n \ninform a more comprehensive model of LGBTQ youth experiences to demonstrate how these \nconcepts may interact found in Figure 2.3 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.3 The final model: A Continuum Depiction of Social Support/Nonsupport Actions and \nDescriptions \n104 \n \nFigure 2.3 also presented the depiction of LGBTQ youths’ continuum of experiences. \nStudying social support and nonsupport together was posed in the Kiperman et al. (2014), \nfollowing the independent exploration of these two constructs by Munoz-Plaza (2002), House \n(1981), and Neufeld and Harrison (2003). The Kiperman et al. (2014) conveyed a continuum of \nexperiences to depict how one idea (e.g., judgment) could be presented as supportive (e.g., \nnonjudgmental/open-minded) and as nonsupportive (e.g., judgmental/close-minded).  Similarly, \nthe current model in Figure 2.3 shows the opposing nature of social support and nonsupport \nactions and descriptions, by having social support and nonsupport at opposing sides of the figure \nfor each construct.  \n  While previous studies have used in loco parentis consent procedures (e.g., Maguen et \nal., 2000; Pilkington & D’Augelli, 1995; Rosario et al., 2012; etc.), this was the first study that \nthe researchers could identify that depicted a sample with equal groups of youth without parent \nconsent. From a transformative framework, including LGBTQ youth without parent consent in \nresearch is important to depict voices that have been underrepresented. This study confronts the \nassumption that perceptions of LGBTQ youth with parent consent represent the perceptions of \nall LGBTQ youth by voicing their experiences and presenting exploratory findings of how youth \nwith and without parent consent compare to one another. Previous research has had limited \ndepiction of LGBTQ youth without access to parent consent, likely due to the rigorous process of \nimplementing in loco parentis procedures, when institutional review boards have parent consent \nfor minors as a standard expectation (Varjas et al. 2008). The researchers could only have in loco \nparentis consent procedures approved by the university institutional review board if researchers \ncould demonstrate that there was limited risk for youth who participated in this study, if \nrecruitment venues formally signed on to this project, and if a youth advocate was identified with \n105 \n \neach site to sign a form in place of parent consent (but that was not consent itself) for youth to \nparticipate (Bankert & Amdur, 2006).  \nLimitations and Future Directions \nThis study overcame limitations of the Kiperman et al. (2014) article by including \ntransgender youth in the sample, by having a sample where all youth were under 18 years of age, \nand where youth without access to parent consent were included. Despite these gains, there were \nlimitations in the recruitment methods this study used. This study is one descriptive study using \nqualitative methodology. Additional studies are needed especially quantitative studies that can \naddress the factor structure of this model will make results more generalizable. The results of the \ncurrent chapter should be interpreted with caution due to its exploratory intent to inform a model \nof social support and nonsupport for LGBTQ youth.  \nTransgender youth were included, and their quotes were able to reflect their unique \nexperiences, however, given the Creswell (2002) requirement of having 15-20 participants to \nrepresent a qualitative sample group, there were not enough youth included in the sample to yield \nan analysis to inform group differences of youth with diverse gender identities compared to \nyouth with diverse sexual orientations. Future studies could explore this difference, as the \nexploratory findings informed social support experiences unique to gender diverse youth (e.g., \nwhen others would provide youth with information on chest binders and doctors who work with \ntransgender youth).  \nAnother limitation applied to recruitment procedures. Recruitment occurred in approved \nsites that signed contracts that were submitted to the university IRB. Many sites were \napprehensive to participate because they had to sign a form that indicated their formal affiliation \nwith the study to the IRB. These sites said they would have participated without a signed form, \n106 \n \nwhich limited the researcher’s ability to recruit more participants (e.g., LGBTQ schools in the \nsoutheast, neighborhoods with LGBTQ support and residence). The sample in this study was a \nmajority White/Caucasian and resided in suburbia.   Future studies should include a greater \nproportion of youth with diverse race/ethnicities and from different community environments \n(e.g., urban and rural). This study’s sample included a majority middle class LGBTQ youth \naccording to their self report survey data used in other studies. There is a significant homeless \nyouth population that was not included in this study due to IRB limitations of requiring a formal \nsign on process for recruitment to occur at each site, and the sight was not willing to sign on. \nFuture studies should aim to include these youth in their sample, which would likely require \nfuture use of in loco parentis consent procedures.  \nWhile enhancing the diversity of this sample is a goal, it is beyond the scope of this study \nto determine how various marginalized identity descriptions interact to inform how participants \nexperience social support and nonsupport. Future research could address these questions where \nparticipants with multiple diverse identities are systematically recruited to explore the different, \nrelative role each identity component contributes to their LGBTQ youth experience of support \nand nonsupport.  \nFuture research should be conducted to inform the proposed model (Figure 2.3) of social \nsupport and nonsupport actions and descriptions. This is the first study to identify the revised \nmodel in Figure 2.3, and further exploration is needed to confirm the actions and descriptions \nidentified using qualitative methods. Additionally, more qualitative and preliminary quantitative \nwork is needed to inform the continuum of support and nonsupport experiences. What remains \nunclear is at what point a support become not supportive and visa versa, as well as clarifying \nhow supportive and not supportive actions and descriptions interact. \n107 \n \nAdditional quantitative work could inform scale development of the model’s social \nsupport/nonsupport actions and descriptions to see how they fit into factors. Developing factors \nfor support/nonsupport actions and descriptions with likert values could validate the developed \nconstructs and would allow researchers to quantitatively inform how the factors in Figure 2.3 \ninteract.  Developing scales out of this model could present a continuum of experiences via likert \ndepiction where experiences could range from extremely supportive/nonsupportive to not \nsupportive at all.  The quantitative studies could benefit from qualitative components, by \nenacting a mixed methods approach to develop an in-depth understanding how social support \nand nonsupport influence the lives of LGBTQ youth. A mixed-methods approach is the preferred \nmethodology of a transformative approach (Mertens, 2007), to ensure the quantitative methods \nare informed by the context of the culture specific sample to whom the results are applied. \nQuantitative study designs should explore differences of youth with and without consent, \nas they relate to their experiences of support and nonsupport. Differences between groups could \nbe assessed through significance and effect size testing to inform generalizability. Multilevel \nmodeling could explore how social support and nonsupport inform LGBTQ youths’ diverse \nexperiences.  \nImplications for Practice \nThe proposed conceptual model in Figure 2.2, provided practitioners and researchers with \na blueprint with regard to how LGBTQ youth with and without parent consent conceptualize \ntheir experiences of social support and nonsupport. It is important for practitioners to understand \nhow LGBTQ youth’s perspectives may differ from a typical youth so practitioners can address \ntheir unique needs (Office of the Surgeon General, 2001; Sue & Sue, 2013). For instance, many \nyouth in this sample discussed coming out to others as a supportive or not supportive experience. \n108 \n \nPractitioners should be prepared to provide supportive responses (e.g., having informational \nsupport by recommending LGBTQ resources and support groups or being open-\nminded/nonjudgmental throughout this discussion). Practitioners should display genuine \nunconditional regard and open-mindedness. If one a practitioner or researcher is judgmental \ntowards LGBTQ youth, either educating oneself on the lived experiences of these youth could \nbuild cultural competence and likelihood of being an informed source of support. \n It is also important for practitioners to have an awareness that there are youth without \naccess to parent consent in the school system in need of services. Youth may be unwilling to \nreach out to others in fear of being ‘outed’. Practitioners can make conscious efforts to recruit \nyouth to confidential services via snowball recruitment, as this study enacted and via flyers in \napproved settings. Once LGBTQ youth without consent are recruited, it may be important to find \nout what prevents them from accessing consent, to inform what kind of support they need (e.g., \nemotional, tangible/instrumental, appraisal or informational).  Practitioners are encouraged to \nexhaust efforts of advertising their services in a way that all youth can be informed of what they \ncan access.  LGBTQ youth without access to parent consent services is critical, as they may have \nlimited supports and access to services without the support or consent of their parents. \nThis paper’s presentation of support descriptions indicates that providers of support \nshould be cognizant of how they provide support to LGBTQ youth and how these findings can be \na basis for consulting with educators, parents and others about how to provide LGBTQ youth \nwith support. Social support and nonsupport descriptions can be experienced with each support \nand nonsupport action, respectively. While the model of social support and nonsupport actions \nindicate what practitioners can do to be helpful, providing support could likely be more effective \nif it is provided in a way LGBTQ youth view positively. Conversely, by knowing what LGBTQ \n109 \n \nyouth view as not supportive, practitioners can make conscious efforts to avoid actions that \nconvey nonsupport.  \nThe sample in this study included youth without access to parent consent. Research on \nLGBTQ youth often generalize results to the entire LGBTQ youth community, when a critical \npart of the sample has been left out (youth without access to parent consent). Like researchers, it \nis practitioner’s responsibility to advocate for all LGBTQ youth and to seek out youth who may \nnot have the support other youth may have. Not having access to parent consent could prevent \nyouth from engaging in activities that may heighten their parent’s awareness of their sexual \norientation or gender identity (e.g., a Gay Straight Alliance field trip or involvement in LGBTQ \nyouth groups) due to parents’ possible disapproval of the youth’s LGBTQ identity. While \npractitioners may not necessarily be able to identify LGBTQ youth without access to parent \nconsent, one way to show one’s open-mindedness and lack of judgment could be to have flyers \navailable that remind students of the confidential services available or having a symbol by one’s \ndoor showing their support of the LGBTQ community. Having these items displayed could allow \na youth who is not out to their parents or peers identify a safe space to seek help. Youth without \naccess to parent consent could not feel comfortable reaching out unless they feel safe in doing so. \nBy accounting for youth without access to parent consent, we can enact more preventative \nmeasures to protect youth who may otherwise not seek out services when needed.\t\n110 \n \n \nReferences \nAlmeida, J., Johnson, R.

    "abstract": "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ) youth can benefit from protective factors (e.g., social support). While a framework of LGBTQ youth social support and nonsupport exists (e.g., Kiperman, Varjas, Meyers, & Howard, 2014), findings were exploratory and demonstrated limited generalizability. A transformative framework indicates research should include LGBTQ youth without parent consent in addition to those with consent, as they have limited representation in literature.\nChapter one is a systematic review of counseling/psychotherapy interventions practices with LGBTQ youth overtime. Inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded a full review of n = 15 studies from N = 3,025 sources. Some reviewed variables include: recruitment methods, consent procedures, treatment type, design/measurement, and outcomes. Results identified (n = 2) studies that practiced behavior modification in the 1970’s and 1990’s, while studies meeting current ethical treatment types (e.g., affirmative, culture specific, strength based) (n = 8), occurred from the 2000’s to present day. Few studies identified consent procedures (n = 4). This chapter is among the first to explore characteristics of counseling/psychotherapy for LGBTQ youth chronologically.\nChapter two’s qualitative analysis explored whether LGBTQ youth experiences confirmed and/or disconfirmed an existing model of LGBTQ youth social support/nonsupport types (Kiperman et al., 2014). A total of (N = 42) LGBTQ youth with (n = 21) and without (n = 21) parent consent were interviewed. Unique contributions included replacing Kiperman et al.’s (2014) concepts, support and nonsupport types with support and nonsupport actions (what support/nonsupport was enacted) and descriptions (traits or mannerisms of a provided support/nonsupport or person). Findings compared experiences of youth with and without parent consent. Samples discussed social support and nonsupport similarly, permitting use of the same codebook across samples. More youth with parent consent endorsed experiencing appraisal, tangible/instrumental, and informational social support actions compared to youth without parent consent; however more youth without parent consent endorsed emotional social support actions. Social nonsupport descriptions codes were endorsed with greater frequency by youth without parent consent or equally among both samples. Implications inform how support/nonsupport actions and descriptions may interact. Analyses of sample differences validated the need to include LGBTQ youth without parent consent in research",
