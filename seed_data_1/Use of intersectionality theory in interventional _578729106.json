The extentto which intersectionality has been used within interventional health research has not been system-atically examined. This scoping review aimed to map out the use of intersectionality. It exploresthe use of intersectionality when designing and implementing public health interventions, or whenanalysing the impact of these interventions. Methods: We undertook systematic searches of Medlineand Scopus from inception through June 2021, with key search terms including “intersectionality”,“interventions” and “public health”. References were screened and those using intersectionality andprimary data from high-income countries were included and relevant data synthesised. Results: Afterscreening 2108 studies, we included 12 studies. Six studies were qualitative and focused on alcoholand substance abuse (two studies), mental health (two studies), general health promotion (one study)and housing interventions (one study). The three quantitative studies examined mental health (twostudies) and smoking cessation (one study), while the three mixed-method studies examined mentalhealth (two studies) and sexual exploitation (one study). Intersectionality was used primarily to anal-yse intervention effects (eight studies), but also for intervention design (three studies), and one studyused it for both design and analysis. Ethnicity and gender were the most commonly included axesof inequality (11 studies), followed by socio-economic position (10 studies). Four studies includedconsideration of LGBTQ+ and only one considered physical disability. Intersectional frameworkswere used by studies to formulate specific questions and assess differences in outcomes by inter-sectional markers of identity. Analytical studies also recommended intersectionality approaches toimprove future treatments and to structure interventions to focus on power and structural dynamics.Conclusions: Intersectionality theory is not yet commonly used in interventional health research, ineither design or analysis. Conditions such as mental health have more studies using intersectionality,while studies considering LGBTQ+ and physical disability as axes of inequality are particularlysparse. The lack of studies in our review suggests that theoretical and methodological advancementsneed to be made in order to increase engagement with intersectionality in interventional health.Keywords: intersectionality; health inequalities; health interventions; evidence synthesis1. IntroductionThe Marmot Review 2020 found that there has not been the expected reduction inhealth inequalities in the UK and some inequalities have widened [1]. This picture is similaracross many other high-income countries, with strategies having limited success in dealingwith the long term consequences of the financial crisis of 2008, among other structuralissues [2].These difficulties have given rise to new forms of framing health inequalities and anincreased desire for strategies to overcome identified barriers and help to theorise andInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6370. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20146370 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerphInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6370 2 of 20communicate their nature, causes and solutions [3]. Intersectionality explicitly considersmultiple axes which may give rise to health inequalities and represents a potentiallypromising way forward on these issues [4]. The concept was first developed by Crenshawin 1980 and is rooted in Black feminist and critical legal theory [5]. It is based on the premisethat there are multiple social forces, social identities and ideological instruments throughwhich power and disadvantage are expressed and legitimized [5]. While there is no clearconsensus about the exact definition of intersectionality, a key focus on social justice andmutually cross-cutting and interacting dimensions of identity are commonly used [6,7].Core principles include: (1) an explicit focus on structural factors or social determinantsof health; (2) consideration of discrimination, particularly across more than one axis ofinequality; (3) a focus on an equitable power dynamic with communities and users ofservices [8].Intersectionality has been adopted in research to consider and assess ‘intersections’ of awide range of identities and positions, including ethnicity, socioeconomic position, gender,LGBTQI+ and physical disability [9]. Intersectionality has been described as an essentialtheoretical framework that may be particularly useful to address health issues and theirimpact on the most vulnerable populations [6]. There are a range of analytic and theoreticalframeworks that come under the concept of intersectionality, with substantial heterogeneitybetween these. Prominent examples such as the Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis(IBPA) attempt to set out policy-based frameworks that support the decision-makingprocesses among stakeholders working in health-related sectors [7,10]. This frameworkhas provided a structure to critically analyse policy, to understand policy contexts andto generate innovative equity-focused policy solutions. Other frameworks aim to offer acontext for conceptualising and interpreting intersectionality at the individual level for bothquantitative and qualitative research [11]. However, despite the strong theoretical rationalefor adopting intersectionality within public health research and a suite of developedframeworks for researchers to employ it, little is known about whether intersectionality(either these noted frameworks or other manifestations) is being translated into health-related interventional research. Mapping out the extent of intersectionality’s use within thefield will help ascertain whether researchers are adopting this potentially useful conceptinto their applied research, or whether intersectionality may remain stagnant as a purelytheoretical concept. Scoping out the current evidence base will also identify successful(or unsuccessful) adoption of intersectionality, to provide learning for other researchersdeveloping or evaluating interventions. Until we have an idea of the extent of use, we areunable to make assessments of its interventional utility and make recommendations forimplementation.Within public health, the possibility of interventions exacerbating health inequalitieshas been highlighted and is beginning to be investigated through subgroup analyses [12,13].However, interventions which focus on only one axis of inequality are similarly limitedand risk worsening inequalities by not sufficiently tailoring delivery to different groups orevaluating the effects to account for interactions. Intersectionality could thus prove usefulin designing and evaluating public health interventions, allowing researchers to determinethe equitability of their intervention in a way that accounts for multiple interlockinginequalities, yet review evidence is lacking and the extent to which it is being employedis relatively unknown. One systematic review published in 2021 mapped the presenceof intersectionality in quantitative health research [14]. However, this study did notexplore the use of intersectionality in studies of health interventions, a gap we intend toaddress. Further, an overview by Heard et al. [15] provides some direction around howintersectionality is beginning to be incorporated into public health promotion and givesexamples related specifically to public health interventions. For instance, consulting peoplefrom minority ethnic backgrounds at the start of intervention development to recognisealternative consequences for people who sit at unique social positions. Crucially for ourreview, Heard et al. reiterate that applying intersectionality to methodology remainsInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6370 3 of 20under-explored, but there are innovative modelling methods emerging which may advancequantitative intersectionality-informed analysis [15,16].Given this potential utility of intersectionality for interventional research, our scopingreview seeks to clarify how intersectionality is being used within interventions throughsystematic scoping methods. It is hoped that, through doing this, we will gain a better ideaof the landscape of interventions using intersectionality and can begin to identify successes,challenges and recommendations to help researchers design more equitable interventions.Our review provides an initial step in this process, through examining the extent to whichintersectionality frameworks are used within interventional health research.Review AimOur review aim was: To explore what evidence is there on the use of theoreticaland analytical intersectionality frameworks when designing and analysing public healthinterventions. Our scoping review set out to explore the use of intersectionality theoryand/or frameworks when designing or implementing public health interventions. We alsoaimed to identify intersectionality-based analytical approaches to examining the impact ofinterventions on health inequalities.2. MethodsGiven the nature of our aim, we used a scoping review to allow flexibility to capture arange of intersectionality frameworks. Scoping reviews summarise evidence to convey thebreadth and depth of a field, and may involve some analytical reinterpretation of the re-search literature [17,18]. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviewsand Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) reporting guidelines andalign with recommended methods for scoping reviews [17,19–21].We used a configurative approach to identify intersectionality frameworks supportinginterventions. Configurative syntheses focus on gathering evidence to elucidate certainprocesses rather than testing any intervention effects. We thus aimed to organise availabledata to better understand and answer our review question.2.1. EligibilityWe included studies exploring the utility of intersectionality frameworks either todesign/implement or to analyse the impacts of public health interventions. We onlyincluded interventional health-related studies that aimed to effect physical or mentalhealth outcomes. In line with the core concepts of intersectionality, our health inequalitysearch terms included ethnicity, socioeconomic position, gender, LGBTQI+ and disability.We included studies which directly mentioned intersectionality theoretical or analyticalframeworks within the paper.2.1.1. Inclusion CriteriaTo be included in our review, studies should address intersectionality when designing,implementing and/or evaluating interventions. We remained open to a range of uses ofintersectionality, expecting heterogeneity between studies in both the degree to which it wasemployed as either a framework for design or analysis, as well as the way it was interpretedand applied. Therefore, there may be studies that mention that they use intersectionality asa lens in their early discussions during the design of the intervention as well as studies thatemploy intersectionality as a guiding framework throughout the whole of the design andevaluation process—and both these would be included under our criteria. All study typeswere accepted, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method approaches.We limited our inclusion criteria to high income countries for a few reasons. First, theintervention implementation context between high income countries (HICs) and low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) can be quite different, and reviews regularly separateinclusion criteria in this way. While intersectionality is a potentially useful concept for bothcontexts, the systems of power and oppression are likely different in different contexts, anInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6370 4 of 20idea beginning to be explored through applying intersectionality with the consideration ofgeographic and socioeconomic contexts [22]. One article highlights the second reason forreviewing HICs separate from LMICs, in that studies employing intersectionality in LMICstend to be focused on immunization, HIV and violence and sexual abuse [23]—all publichealth topics quite different to health behaviour and mental health topics typical of HICinterventions. Finally, the recent systematic review on intersectionality in public healthresearch cited in the background did include studies from both high and low-and-middleincome countries and found that the vast majority of studies were conducted in highincome countries [24]. Therefore, while our scoping review is limited by this omission, wedo not expect there would have been many additional studies to include, yet a considerableamount more studies to screen.To be included, we restricted studies to being health-related studies (i.e., measuringor analysing any indicator or topic related to physical or mental health of populations, aswell as health system related outcomes), as opposed to educational or social outcomes,providing original results.2.1.2. Exclusion CriteriaWe excluded studies that were commentaries, editorials, book reviews or studiesexclusively focused on educational, sociological or judicial issues.2.2. Search StrategyThe main search strategy was conducted in Medline and Scopus in June 2021. Thesearch strategy was initially designed for Medline and then adapted to be replicated inScopus. The search terms used were related to “intersectionality”, “interventions” and“public health” (Appendix A for full search strategy). The searches were not limited byyear or language. In addition, the citations of identified key papers were screened to findrelevant studies that had not been captured by the search strategy. The retrieved referenceswere stored and managed using EndNote X9 (Clarivate, Emeryville/Berkley, CA, USA).References were exported to the web-based software Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation,Melbourne, Australia) for screening.2.3. ScreeningThe screening was conducted by two researchers (ARG and LT). Initially, the titles andabstracts of articles identified from the search strategy were screened against the inclusionand exclusion criteria. Then, the same process was carried out with the full text of selectedarticles. Any disagreement was solved through discussion with a third researcher (AAL).2.4. Data ExtractionA data extraction form was created including the following fields: study design, set-ting, number of participants, year of publication, country, target population, inequalitiestargeted, areas of intervention, summary of quantitative and qualitative outcomes, descrip-tion of intersectionality framework, intersectionality approach and any additional notes.2.5. Synthesis of the ResultsResearch evidence from quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies wassummarised narratively. We described studies according to their target populations andaxes of inequality addressed. Studies were categorised into those where intersectionalityframeworks were used (1) in order to design their interventions from the outset, and(2) after interventions were implemented in order to analyse effects.2.6. Selection ProcessThe search strategy retrieved 2568 references, of which 460 were duplicates (Figure 1).The titles and abstracts of 2108 references were screened, resulting in 383 references includedin full text screening. The most common reasons for exclusion were “studies not usingInt. J. Environ. Res.

Includedpopulations were: health researchers [25]; Polish migrants [26]; mental health serviceusers [27]; women on (or previously on) opioid substitution treatment [28]; single adults inreceipt of welfare for housing [29]; pregnant/postpartum women [30]; Asian men affectedby mental illness [31]; people who smoke tobacco [32]; people receiving individual mentalhealth counselling [33]; youth at risk of sexual exploitation [34]; homeless women [35];Latina women who had experienced interpersonal violence [36]. The number of participantsvaried between 17 and 415, with lower sample sizes in the qualitative studies.The most commonly addressed individual axes of inequality were ethnicity and gender,which were considered by 11 studies each (Table 2 and Figure 2). SES was considered by10 studies. LGBTQ+ was considered by four studies and disability by one study. Of ourfive pre-defined axes of inequality, only one study considered all five, with two studiesconsidering four of these axes. Six out of the twelve studies considered three out of five ofour pre-defined axes of inequality. There was heterogeneity regarding which intersections(e.g., sex X ethnicity X age), although SES, ethnicity and gender were considered by eightout of the twelve included studies.Table 2.

Eight studies used intersectionality to analyse the association between inequality axes and intervention outcomes [26–29,31–33,35]. The role of intersectionality within these studies was mainly related to the interpretation of the findings in terms of cross-cutting inequalities. Four of these studies analysed mental health related problems [27,31,33,35], one study focused on smoking cessation [32], one on housing [29], one on alcohol abuse and one on drug abuse [26,28]. There were considerable differences in the use of intersec-tionality. Whilst, in some studies, intersectionality clearly structured the analysis of the results [28,31,32], other papers only used intersectionality as one option for the interpre-tation of the findings [27]. Three studies utilised intersectionality to design interventions with an aim to en-hance their effectiveness on reducing health inequalities [25,34,36]. In these studies, inter-sectionality was consistently used to guide the design of the interventions across the stud-ies. One study used intersectionality for both the design of the intervention as well as the interpretation of findings [30] (Table 2).  3.1.1. Use of Intersectionality to Analyse Impacts of Interventions (Eight Studies) Four of the studies which used intersectionality to analyse the effects of interventions were on mental health. These studies examined various intersections using gender, eth-nicity, SES and LGBTQ+ indicators. In addition to analysis of intervention effects, one study used intersectionality to decide what axis of inequality should be used to measure effects [33]. The other three studies concluded their analyses by proposing intersectional-ity as a useful framework for improving or tailoring services in the future. These studies demonstrate an awareness and use of the key tenets of intersectionality: three of them use such frameworks from the outset, including Kivlighan et al. [33], which addresses the question of whether intersecting identities effect treatment outcomes. All of these studies conclude that the use of intersectional frameworks is beneficial in maintaining suitable awareness of social dynamics and recommend their further use. In one study by Lloyd et al. [27], issues of intersectionality were raised by the participants as a way to improve treatments.  024681012SESEthnicityOther(s)LGBTQ+DisabilityGenderInequality axes considered in studiesFigure 2.

All of these studies conclude that theuse of intersectional frameworks is beneficial in maintaining suitable awareness of socialdynamics and recommend their further use. In one study by Lloyd et al. [27], issues ofintersectionality were raised by the participants as a way to improve treatments.Of these studies on mental health, Lloyd et al. [27] interviewed and surveyed LGBQ+patients who had completed a cognitive behavioural programme to overcome mental healthissues specifically designed for sexual minorities. An important suggestion for developingand improving this therapy from the patients was the use of an intersectional lens toacknowledge the totality of people’s experiences and to move beyond a predominant focuson male sexuality and identity. Kivlighan et al. [33] used an intersectionality framework toinvestigate therapist–client interaction in relation to gender and ethnicity. Their analysis of415 clients treated by 16 therapists found that there were differences in therapists’ abilityto reduce psychological distress depending on the intersection of ethnicity and gender.Morrow et al. [31] used intersectionality as an analytical framework to explore Asian men’sdiverse experiences of stigma and mental health, including how this is mediated by a rangeof other identities and experiences of racism, inequality and immigration. They report thatparticipants understood and experienced their stigma as linked to their social identitiesand that intersectional frameworks must feature prominently in attempts to reduce mentalhealth stigma. David et al. [35] used an intersectional framework in their mixed-methodevaluation of mental health services delivery for women who are homeless. Their findingshighlight the importance of tailoring treatments to account for the multiple forms ofoppression faced by these women and assuming a culturally sensitive therapeutic stance intreatment. They specifically reference the intersectional oppression faced by these homelesswomen and advocate the use of an intersectional perspective in providing treatment.The remaining four studies using intersectionality to analyse the impacts of interven-tions targeted smoking cessation, housing and alcohol and drug misuse. These studiesall used intersectionality frameworks to assess whether the interplay of social identitiesis more important to consider than individual axes of inequality. Three of these studiesexamined whether outcomes differed according to intersectional markers of identity, andone recommended the consideration of intersectionality as a method to improve services.They did not, however, contain explicit reference to power dynamics or discrimination.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6370 9 of 20Potter et al. [32] used an intersectional framework to assess how the interplay of multi-ple marginalised attributes contributes to smoking cessation. This study found that lowhousehold income was related to continued smoking but identified no interaction betweenmarginalised attributes and relapse. Gleeson et al. [26] explored associations between socialattitudes towards gender and access to services related to migrant status and social classaccording. Their findings suggested that Polish female migrants accessing alcohol-relatedservices face barriers including social stigma and sexist attitudes towards women, and thatthese interact to create negative outcomes. Medina-Perucha et al. [28] studied the inter-section of different types of inequalities in women receiving opioid substitution treatmentwith a focus on issues of stigma and discrimination. They highlighted that stigma inter-acts with other aspects of the women’s identities, including drug use and homelessness,to create negative outcomes. Wilkinson and Ortega-Alcázar [29] studied the impact ofshared housing on young people and their wellbeing using an intersectional perspective.Their findings stressed the importance of considering the intersection of different types ofinequalities on physical safety and violence, mental health and isolation.3.1.2. Intersectionality as a Tool to Design Interventions (Four Studies)Three studies used intersectionality to design interventions [25,34,36]. We have in-cluded Stevens et al. [30] in this category, which used intersectionality for both design andanalysis. The main value of intersectionality in these studies was to provide the appropriatemechanisms to culturally adapt interventions, in order to cover the intersection betweendifferent types of health inequalities. In these studies, intersectionality was specifically usedto address social factors related to ethnicity and gender [25,30,36], and to a lesser extentsocioeconomic position and LGBTQI+ [34], within intervention design. In general, thesestudies applied key tenets from intersectionality frameworks with a focus on structuralfactors and power dynamics.Liu et al. interviewed 26 health researchers and promoters to explore their viewson adapting interventions for ethnic minority women [25]. Researchers interviewed inthis study were clear that intersectionality was helpful in understanding the combinedinfluence of ethnicity and gender among other factors in health promotion interventions.They highlight that intersectionality, as well as the concepts of representation and con-textual experiences, are all useful in understanding how adapting interventions works inpractice. Bounds et al. [34] and Kelly and Pich [36] both used intersectionality frameworksto acknowledge and address issues of power and discrimination, in line with the key tenetsof intersectionality. Bounds et al. [34] aimed to adapt an intervention for newly homelessyouth to be used to reduce risk factors for sexual exploitation. Participants recognisedthe importance of acknowledging experiences of structural violence, while the authorsconcluded that focus groups and intersectionality are useful in considering the uniqueissues of disempowered youth. Kelly and Pich [36] aimed to reduce post-traumatic stressdisorder and improve quality of life, social support and self-efficacy among Latinas whoexperienced intimate partner violence. The authors integrated both biomedical and in-tersectional approaches throughout their study, adapting a family intervention to reducerisk factors for sexual exploitation and acknowledging issues of power and invisibility.They concluded that that interventions helped to improve mental health related symptoms,with an intersectional approach being key to this, although there were limited impacts onother outcomes.The only study which used intersectionality to design and analyse their interventionwas Stevens et al. [30]. This study used intersectionality to assess the effectiveness of acoordinated perinatal mental health care model focused on socially disadvantaged ethnicminority women. They use the framework to conceptualise the ‘vulnerability’ of thesewomen as influenced by a range of interacting structural factors. They found similartreatment outcomes among ethnic minorities as in White patients and concluded that theirtreatment model based on intersectionality has promise to reduce inequalities in this area,over and above approaches without an intersectionality framework.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6370 10 of 204. DiscussionThis scoping review aimed to explore the use of intersectionality in the design and/orassessment of interventional health research. Our findings suggest that intersectionalityframeworks are not yet explicitly used in this body of research, as we identified only12 studies in total. In the studies we identified, the axes of inequality gender, ethnicity andsocio-economic position were commonly assessed, but there was less attention paid to othermarkers of inequality. In our included studies, intersectionality frameworks were usedto pose questions about intervention effectiveness and interpret differences in outcomes,and were recommended for use in tailoring and delivering future treatments. We foundthat intersectionality frameworks were more commonly used to assess the impacts ofpre-existing interventions, rather than to use these frameworks to develop new methods oftackling health inequalities.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review studying the use of intersectional-ity frameworks within interventional health research. Some previous research has exploredthe association between intersectionality and health through theoretical, qualitative andobservational studies, without considering health interventions specifically [14]. Oneprevious review analysed evidence on the use of intersectionality in health by mappingits presence [14]. This review pointed to significant room for improvement in explicitlyconnecting research methods and reporting to intersectionality frameworks in studies andfocusing more on interventions. Our scoping review builds on this work and the fact thatwe found so few studies suggests there is still some way to go before intersectionality iscomprehensively incorporated into interventional research.Other work by Harari and Lee has identified limitations in quantitative researchusing intersectionality, including the prioritisation of certain groups and not others, anda lack of consideration of underlying processes [37]. While we found only a limitednumber of studies, those quantitative studies which we did identify chime with Harariand Lee’s assessments. Promisingly, however, there was also evidence that the includedstudies had taken care to consider diverse identities and drivers of inequality, includingstigma, power dynamics and identity. However, some characteristics were included morecommonly than others: we found ethnicity and gender to be the most commonly includedintersections, but a comparative lack of consideration of LGBTQi+ and disability. This,perhaps, is unsurprising given that intersectionality was borne out of an interest specificallyin the position of Black women, and that gender and ethnicity are common demographiccharacteristics collected in intervention research [5,38].Researchers have warned against intersectionality work sliding into ‘oppressionOlympics’ [39], in which we try to determine which characteristic is most important for ahealth outcome instead of appreciating the nuance and complexity of people’s intersectionalpositions. Our finding that gender and ethnicity were the most commonly included charac-teristics, while expected given the recognition of these as key dimensions of inequality andthus greater data availability, reflects the debates around differentiating categories withinintersectionality [40]. There are three approaches to this: intra-categorical approachesthat focus on complexity of experience within a particular social position or intersection,inter-categorical approaches that focus on heterogeneity across a range of intersections andanti-categorical approaches that critique rigid social categorization itself [14]. There is anargument that interventional research needs to categorise to some extent to determine thesuccess of the strategy, with gender and ethnicity being core categories by which researcherswant to understand intervention effects. Interventional research has therefore mostly usedinter-categorical approaches, working within a traditionally positivist paradigm [15]. Tobegin to address this challenge and to uncover inequalities in a more nuanced way, thereis a need for innovative and mixed methods that can explore the richness and detail ofpeople’s experiences while also conducting intervention effect comparisons.The studies included used a range of methods to employ intersectionality, drawing ondifferent concepts dependent on their methods. Although intersectionality is increasinglyhighlighted as a promising framework for public health research, there is still uncertaintyInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6370 11 of 20and challenge about how to operationalise it methodologically [3]. It is therefore unclearhow to determine whether intersectionality was appropriately applied to the differentmethods used by the included studies. What we can say is that all the included studies usedintersectionality as an analytic framework, rather than approaching the presence or absenceof intersectionality as a testable hypothesis [41]. This finding is positive, given calls forintersectionality to be used analytically, rather than purely descriptively. Regarding topicarea, we found that mental health accounted for half of the included studies, which couldbe related to the burgeoning field of research that has identified social inequalities in mentalhealth across multiple dimensions of inequality, such as socioeconomic position, genderand sexual orientation, among others [42]. Further, within mental health research, there hasbeen increasing focus on how these dimensions of inequality may need to be incorporatedinto analysis to identify complex and potentially unexpected patterns in the distribution ofhealth [42]. Finally, mental health research is well suited to intersectionality, as the peopleand groups occupying positions of multiple disadvantages may well experience identityissues, stigma, discrimination and disempowerment.We found limited evidence on the explicit use of intersectionality frameworks to sup-port the development of interventions. Those studies which did, however, had a strongrecognition of the issues of power, structural dynamics and discrimination, and they consid-ered these in intervention development. There is an inherent complexity in addressing theseissues, which may explain in part why we found a limited number of studies. Furthermore,some of these components have been recognised as useful elements to tackle inequalitieswithout being mentioned as part of any intersectionality framework [43]. Hence, ratherthan being underrepresented, intersectionality might be to some extent underreported,since many of its main components may be currently used in health interventions, eventhough they are not framed as intersectionality in any theoretical background.The benefits of incorporating intersectionality into public health research are well-established in theory and have been championed by scholars over the past fewdecades [5,10,11,14]. What our scoping review intended to contribute was evidence as towhether intersectionality is being actively used by researchers in the development andevaluation of interventions. What we found was limited use of intersectionality withininterventional research, perhaps as a result of some of the points we have discussed. Thereis motivation from many within the public health community to adopt intersectionalityas a way of reducing health inequalities but translating it into methodological approachesremains a challenge. While our small sample size limits what we can recommend in termsof intersectionality and intervention research, we would suggest that incorporating in-tersectionality in the design of interventions (not as a post-intervention analysis), wouldstrengthen the equity focus. As fewer studies used intersectionality in this way, our reviewconveys that there is still some way to go before this becomes more commonplace. Wewould direct researchers to resources such as Hankivsky et al.’s [44] primer and Heardet al.’s paper [15], which both provide case study examples of innovation using intersec-tionality frameworks in public health research. Additionally, the ‘For-Equity’ website alsoprovides tools and resources related to intersecting inequalities to enable researchers tothink about this when developing and evaluating interventions [45].Strengths and LimitationsThis review presents a timely review of research on the use of intersectionality ininterventional health research. It identifies that intersectionality is not yet commonly usedin this body of research. The reduction of health inequalities is a core component of publichealth and has been since its inception, and so this is a highly relevant topic within publichealth research. Our most recent search was undertaken in June 2021, so there may berelevant studies missing from our analysis. Staff changes affected our capacity to updatethe searches. We used a broad, pre-defined comprehensive search strategy using two of themain biomedical databases, and the citations of identified key papers were also screened.Nonetheless, the main limitation of this review is that we only included papers explicitlyInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 6370 12 of 20mentioning intersectionality or related terms. We did pilot searches in an attempt toidentify papers which used key tenets of intersectionality. This, however, was not feasible,as almost all papers would have to be read at full text stage in order to assess if they hadused intersectional ideas or those of interacting identities in the consideration of theirresults. This means that we may have missed studies which did not use the term explicitly,but which used strategies in line with intersectionality frameworks. As such, our resultslikely constitute an underestimate of the extent of use of intersectionality frameworks ininterventional health research.A further limitation of our scoping review is that we limited our inclusion criteriato high income countries only. This means our findings are non-transferrable to low-and-middle income countries. There is work that explores intersectionality use in research inlow-and-middle income countries [23], and also a review that does not separate in thisway [24]. We would suggest that future work seeks to compare these two intervention con-texts, as it may have implications for the extent and ways intersectionality is implemented.Our scoping review intended to map out the extent to which intersectionality isbeing used in interventional health research and highlight some examples of its use. Anextension of this work would assess whether and how intersectionality impacts on thequality of the interventional health research comparative to the use of other theoretical andanalytical frameworks. Finally, as this was a scoping review focused on exploring the useof intersectionality, we did not conduct formal critical appraisal of included studies.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, this scoping review has revealed there is a lack of evidence on the useof theoretical and analytical intersectionality frameworks when designing and analysingpublic health interventions, with only a small number of studies identified. Where inter-sectionality was adopted, frameworks were used to pose questions about interventioneffectiveness or interpret differences in outcomes, rather than in the design or implementa-tion of interventions. Therefore, intersectionality within this small sample was primarilyused as an analytical framework. Public health research is increasingly highlighting thevalue of intersectionality frameworks for attempting to reduce inequalities. The lack ofstudies in our review suggests that theoretical and methodological advancements needto be made in order to enhance engagement with intersectionality as part of the healthintervention development and assessment cycle.Author Contributions: Methodology, L.T., D.H., S.E.-M. and A.A.L.; validation, D.H., S.E.-M. andA.A.L.; formal analysis, L.T. and A.A.L.; investigation, L.T. and A.A.L.; data curation, L.T. and A.A.L.;writing—original draft, L.T.; writing—review and editing, D.H., S.E.-M. and A.A.L.; visualization,L.T. and A.A.L.; supervision, A.A.L.; funding acquisition, A.A.L.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intersectionality theory posits that considering a single axis of inequality is limited and that considering (dis)advantage on multiple axes simultaneously is needed. The extent to which intersectionality has been used within interventional health research has not been systematically examined. This scoping review aimed to map out the use of intersectionality. It explores the use of intersectionality when designing and implementing public health interventions, or when analysing the impact of these interventions. METHODS: We undertook systematic searches of Medline and Scopus from inception through June 2021, with key search terms including \"intersectionality\", \"interventions\" and \"public health\". References were screened and those using intersectionality and primary data from high-income countries were included and relevant data synthesised. RESULTS: After screening 2108 studies, we included 12 studies. Six studies were qualitative and focused on alcohol and substance abuse (two studies), mental health (two studies), general health promotion (one study) and housing interventions (one study). The three quantitative studies examined mental health (two studies) and smoking cessation (one study), while the three mixed-method studies examined mental health (two studies) and sexual exploitation (one study). Intersectionality was used primarily to analyse intervention effects (eight studies), but also for intervention design (three studies), and one study used it for both design and analysis. Ethnicity and gender were the most commonly included axes of inequality (11 studies), followed by socio-economic position (10 studies). Four studies included consideration of LGBTQ+ and only one considered physical disability. Intersectional frameworks were used by studies to formulate specific questions and assess differences in outcomes by intersectional markers of identity. Analytical studies also recommended intersectionality approaches to improve future treatments and to structure interventions to focus on power and structural dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: Intersectionality theory is not yet commonly used in interventional health research, in either design or analysis. Conditions such as mental health have more studies using intersectionality, while studies considering LGBTQ+ and physical disability as axes of inequality are particularly sparse. The lack of studies in our review suggests that theoretical and methodological advancements need to be made in order to increase engagement with intersectionality in interventional health",
