Introduction \n \nEquality. History has taught that the striving for equality is a \nsignificant catalyst for change. It has stirred revolutions, reversal of political \nsystems and the restructuring of socio-political concepts. It is the incentive \nthat has galvanized billions of people over the course of human history. But \nit is also a pawn in the hands of the powerful. Suppression, the denial of \nequality, keeps systems alive and it secures the power of the ruler. Violence \nbecomes an instrument in the trial of power. It has the force to preserve or \nstrengthen hierarchies but it also possesses the force to subvert them. \nHowever, violence is not limited to its physical essence; it can also be \nexercised indirectly without causing physical harm; simply by preserving \ndetrimental systems and applying elementary rhetoric serving this cause. \nThe late nineteenth century has seen such a manifestation. The 1860s have \nintroduced categories of sexuality that ultimately led to a hierarchy \nsubordinating those people who were identified with the expression \n“homosexual”.  \nThe terms “homosexual” and “heterosexual” were coined in 1868 \nand laid the foundation for the concept of heteronormativity, the rule of the \nexpectation that people identify as heterosexual and live accordingly in \nopposite-sex relationships. All these centuries before, sexual and emotional \nrelationships among same-sex couples were part of European, Asian and \nAmerican societies. Even though same-sex intercourse was already \ncondemned and in some cases persecuted during the Middle Ages it was \nstill practiced in the subsequent centuries. On the American continent, the \nNew England colonies introduced anti-sodomy laws during the sixteenth \ncentury. However, the essence behind the laws was not a feeling of \nsuperiority by people living in opposite-sex relationships but a pragmatic \none. The settlers’ intention to populate the American colonies was tied to \nreproduction and therefore they opposed intercourse that could not result in \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    2 \n \nnewborns.1 It was not until the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of \nthe twentieth century that same-sex intercourse and relationships were \nedged into a subordinate role and encountered massive rejection of major \nparts of societies. The invention of the terms of “homosexuality” and \n“heterosexuality” created categories that were pressured into a dichotomy \nand rivalry. They established an imbalance that resulted in a hierarchy and \nled to an unequal treatment of those constituting the minority. The early \ntwentieth century saw the ultimate establishment of a system that inscribed \ndiscrimination against all those, desiring and loving women and men of the \nsame sex. The system of heteronormativity led to ostracism of homosexuals. \nActs of sodomy were punished with imprisonment; police raids at local gay \nbars saw the use of brutal police violence; homosexuals were laid off at \nwork and faced exclusion from the U.S. military. Gays and lesbians were \ndenied equal treatment and their aspiration to put an end to discrimination \nand violence and instead achieve the fundament right of equality stirred \ntheir revolution.  \nThe Stonewall Riots in June and July 1969 represent the moment in \nhistory when gays, lesbians and transsexuals collectively rebelled against \nthe system of subordination. The gay rights movement was finally \nconstituting itself and initiating a fight against harassment and violence. The \nriots starting in the night of June 28, 1969 were the response to a multitude \nof brutal police raids and they also represented a reaction to the bitter \nhumiliation and degradation lesbians, gays and transsexuals had had to \nendure for decades. Stonewall sparked a movement that was growing in \nintensity and that was achieving victories – slowly but steadily. Soon, \nactivists tried to create the foundation for an efficient movement. Gay Pride \nand Gay Power were embraced and served as resources for creating \nawareness. A year after the Stonewall Riots, activists in New York City as \nwell as Chicago and Los Angeles celebrated their first gay pride parades – a \npractice that has spread around the world and repeats itself every year since. \nThe community became political and that step was aligned with \nadvancements.  \n                                                 \n1 Jonathan Ned Katz, The Invention of Heterosexuality, (New York: Penguine Books, \n1995), 37. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    3 \n \nIn 1973, the American Psychiatric Association removed \nhomosexuality from its official list of mental disorders. In 1977, Harvey \nMilk, an icon of the gay rights movement, was elected to the San Francisco \nBoard of Supervisors and became the first openly gay man in public office \nin California. Activists tried to challenge sodomy laws on a variety of \noccasions in court; ultimately, 34 years after Stonewall, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt ruled in Lawrence vs. Texas that sodomy laws were unconstitutional – \na milestone for the U.S. gay rights movement. It laid the basis for all \nadvancements that were yet to come.  \nStonewall sparked a movement. The experience of violence and \nostracism united lesbians, gays and transsexuals in a way that is still \nsustaining this cohesion nowadays. However, the focus of the gay rights \nmovement has shifted over the last two decades. It has advanced its strategy \nand taken the fight to the next level. The pursuit of equality in all spheres \nhas become the core motivation for activists. After Lawrence vs. Texas, the \nefforts to achieve recognition of civil unions and same-sex marriages came \nto the forefront of the movement’s ambitions. LGBTQ*s’ visibility and \nactivists’ determination have led to advancements in the legal sphere. A \ncombination of strategic litigation and social education constitutes the \nfoundation for the current successes activists achieve. Visibility, the creation \nof awareness, and the subtle subversion of society’s heteronormativity play \na major part in achieving the movement’s goals.  \nThe concept of neoliberalism initially appeared to possess vast \npotential to promote equality. Its objective to secure human rights by \nimplementing an economic system that helps to protect equality, freedom \nand peace was noble in its intention but failed to succeed. Instead, \nneoliberalism created a social climate revolving around individualism, greed \nand egotism. It has become the foundation of the weaknesses the LGBTQ*2 \ncommunity is characterized by in their struggle for equality. It has become \nthe danger that threatens the revolution of LGBTQ*s who are crusading for \nequal rights. Major parts of the LGBTQ* community are currently neglected \nby the equality movement of major gay rights organizations.  \n                                                 \n2 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning. The star is supposed to represent \neverybody who is not conforming to cis-gender heterosexuality.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    4 \n \nThis thesis will illuminate the struggle of the modern gay rights \nmovement over the course of the presidency of Barack Obama and the first \n100 days of the Trump administration. It will concentrate on the questions \nwhich role social media plays in the movement for equal rights and which \nstrategies are applied by major gay rights organizations. The main focus will \nbe on an approach that might have the potential to transform the discourse \nof the LGBTQ*’s current socio-political struggle and that could help unite \nneglected groups into the mainstream movement and shift the focus to the \nappliance of violence to keep the heteronormative system alive. This thesis \nwill unite two major injustices that have almost exclusively been treated as \nseparately from each other by major gay rights activists: inequality and \nviolence. While the Stonewall Era and the decades after were characterized \nby a struggle against LGBT violence, the recent years have been dedicated \nto the achievement of equality in the legal sphere. Physical violence against \nLGBTQ* people faded into the background while legal equality dominated \nthe public as well as the academic realm. This development was well-\nrepresented and shared in the academic sphere. \nIn the 1990s, academics contributed a lot to the research on violence \nagainst gay, lesbian and bisexual people – particularly in the field of \nsociology. Additionally, the rise of the new research fields of gender and \nqueer studies contributed to the discussion and laid the basis for new \napproaches. Several monographies as well as journal articles discussed the \nhistorical dimension of anti-gay violence in the context of the pre- as well as \npost-Stonewall era.  \nGary David Comstock was among the first academics analyzing the \nproblem of anti-LGB violence in his book Violence Against Lesbians and \nGay Men published in 1991.3 Additionally, the editors Gregory M. Herek \nand Kevin T. Berrill published a comprehensive overview of anti-gay \nviolence with a detailed analysis of the social context between 1984 and \n1990 and a psychological assessment.4 The editors also included a case \nstudy for anti-lesbian assault and harassment in San Francisco. These works \n                                                 \n3 Gary David Comstock, Violence Against Lesbians and Gay Men, New York: Columbia \nUniversity Press, 1991.  \n4 Gregory M. Herek and Kevin T. Berrill, ed., Hate Crimes: Confronting Violence Against \nLesbians and Gay Men, Newbury Park, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc, 1991.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    5 \n \nwere followed by further discussions of violence as well as social injustice \nagainst LGBs in the decade of the 1990s.  \nViolence and Social Injustice Against Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual \npeople\n5 (1999) provides an overview of hate crimes in the United States and \nhas a strong focus on LGB youths and suicides as well as same-sex marriage \nand job discrimination. Same-sex rape committed by men has also been \nincluded into the debate in 1997 when Michael Scarce published his book \non Male on Male Rape: The Hidden Toll of Stigma and Shame.6 He thereby \nfilled a void that existed to that day and illuminates male rape by men in a \nvariety of settings including institutional environments like the military and \nprisons. A major focus is on the power dynamic male rape bears but also on \nthe intersection of HIV and same-sex rape.  \nThis assessment by sociologists is almost all-inclusive and represents \na cohesive reappraisal of the violence LGBs had to endure in the 1990s and \nthe decades before. What has been hardly covered was the intersectional \nnature of hate violence and hate crimes. The factor of race and gender was \noften neglected and it took some more years until academics shifted their \nfocus on these aspects. However before this trend unfolded, the beginning of \nthe 2000s initially showed an abandonment of discussions of anti-LGB \nviolence within the academic realm. Instead, the examination of the struggle \nfor same-sex marriage attracted more attention. The constitution of a \nmovement for same-sex marriage was analyzed in a variety of books.  \nQueering Marriage: Challenging Family Formation in the United \nStates by Katrina Kimport discusses the early beginnings of the movement \nfor same-sex marriage.7 Mary Bernstein and Verta Taylor contributed to the \nevaluation by publishing the book The Marrying Kind? in 2013.8 They \ndiscuss political strategies and mobilization techniques of the early \nmovement until the year 2009.  \n                                                 \n5 Lacey Sloan and Nora Gustavsson, ed., Violence and Social Injustice Against Lesbian, \nGay, and Bisexual People,  New York: The Haworth Press, 1999. \n6 Michael Scarce, Male on Male Rape: The Hidden Toll of Stigma and Shame, Cambridge: \nPerseus Publishing, 1997.  \n7 Katrina Kimport, Queering Marriage: Challenging Family Formation in the United \nStates, New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2014.  \n8 Mary Bernstein and Verta Taylor, ed., The Marrying Kind?, Minneapolis: University of \nMinnesota Press, 2013. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    6 \n \nSimultaneously, another research topic attracted much interest: the \nlegal interpretation of sodomy laws shifted into focus which was \npredominantly the result of the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence vs. Texas \n(2003). Most academic works contributed to the legal analysis of the court \nruling.  \nDavid A. J. Richards interprets the constitutional right to privacy and \nthe judicial meaning of the court decisions in Bowers vs. Hardwick and \nLawrence vs. Texas.9 Bowers vs. Hardwick represented the Supreme Court \ndecision which declared sodomy illegal in 1986 and therefore constituted \nthe legal foundation for the penalization of sexual relationships among \nsame-sex partners – even in spheres of privacy. It took 17 years until the \nSupreme Court negated the ruling and laid the basis for future advancements \nfor lesbians and gays in the United States.  \nAn even broader approach to the gay rights organization’s legal \nstruggle for equality was provided by Scott Barclay, Mary Bernstein and \nAnna-Maria Marshall in Queer Mobilizations: LGBT Activists Confront the \nLaw.10 The editors provided deep insight into the legal strategies of the \nactivists in the movement’s struggle against sodomy laws and into the early \nlawsuits against the denial of same-sex marriage.  \nAnother significant contribution to the field of academics is \nCharlotte Knight and Kath Wilson’s work on lesbian, gay, bisexual and \ntrans people (LGBT) in the criminal justice system.11 They delineate the \nexperiences of LGBT people as offenders, victims and staff and analyze the \nrole of homophobia in sentencing of alleged perpetrators. Furthermore, they \nexamine same-sex domestic violence and abuse and the disproportionally \nhigh number of lesbians on the death row in the United States.  \nAfter a period of almost ten years, it was specifically the researcher \nfor Women, Gender & Sexuality Doug Meyer who re-shifted the focus on \nanti-LGBTQ* violence in his article “An Intersectional Analysis of Lesbian, \nGay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) People’s Evaluations of Anti-\n                                                 \n9 David A. J. Richards, The sodomy cases: Bowers v. Hardwick and Lawrence v. Texas, \nLawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2009. \n10 Scott Barclay, Mary Bernstein and Anna-Maria Marshall, ed., Queer Mobilizations: \nLGBT Activists Confront the Law, New York: New York University Press, 2009. \n11 Charlotte Knight and Kath Wilson, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans People (LGBT) \nand the Criminal Justice System, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    7 \n \nQueer Violence” in 201212 and who published an even broader research in \n2015.13 Doug Meyer examines the contribution of intersectionality to the \nexperience of violence by taking a closer look on specific case studies. He \nthereby fills the gap that most assessments of the 1990s have left and offers \na more comprehensive and accurate research of LGBTQ* violence.  \nHowever, what most studies of the 1990s and 2000s have in \ncommon is that violence and the striving for equality have been \npredominantly examined separately. It was hardly perceived – neither by \nresearchers nor by the movement itself – that the two topics are closely \ninterrelated and should be treated respectively. The equality movement can \nbe examined with the help of a theory of violence which provides intriguing \napproaches to a new assessment of the LGBTQ* movement and new \nstrategies for future aspirations. In addition, researchers’ studies have not \nyet considered the construction of a collective identity via social media by \nthe LGBTQ* movement – even though social media movements have \nbecome the most influential way to gain the support of the public. These \nvoids will be filled by this thesis. I will illuminate how the major gay rights \norganizations as well as independent activists use social media to crusade \nfor LGBTQ* rights. There has not been a comprehensive study analyzing \nthe social media activism of the LGBTQ* community. This analysis of case \nstudies of LGBTQ* activists will be a major contribution to a so far \nneglected academic terrain. This thesis will additionally include a new \napproach to the academic field by integrating Johan Galtung’s violence \ntriangle into the discourse – an approach that has been chosen only rarely \nand exclusively in the debate surrounding HIV-infected LGBTQ* people \nand imprisoned LGBTQ*s. Still, applying the violence triangle to \nmanifestations of inequality like the denial of same-sex marriage, workplace \ndiscrimination, bullying or homelessness is unprecedented. However, it is \nexactly this approach that could transform the LGBTQ* movement since it \nilluminates the movement’s shortcomings and provides innovative strategies \n                                                 \n12 Doug Meyer, “An Intersectional Analysis of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender \n(LGBT) People’s Evaluations of Anti-Queer Violence,” Gender & Society 26(6) (2012): \n849-873. \n13 Doug Meyer, Violence against Queer People: Race, Class, Gender, and the Persistence \nof Anti-LGBT Discrimination, New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2015.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    8 \n \nto change the discourse. Moreover, this thesis links the shortcomings of the \nLGBTQ* movement to the concept of neoliberalism. While there have been \nstudies on the positive effects of neoliberalism for the integration of \nLGBTQ* people into the economic and simultaneously the socio-political \nsphere, no studies have considered the negative effects of this concept on \nthe movement’s spirit and inclusiveness. However, this thesis will be \nintegrating these factors as well. It is supposed to be a comprehensive \nanalysis of the LGBTQ* movement’s social media activism between 2008 \nand spring 2017 that analyzes the shortcomings in depth, relates them to \nsocio-political and economic circumstances and suggests a different \napproach to counter these developments by applying a theory that has never \nbeen used in the debate before. It closes the voids in this research field that \nexist because the LGBTQ* equality movement and the activism against \nviolence have always been treated separately from each other.  \n \n1. Social Media Activism, Neoliberalism and the \nViolence Triangle – Thesis \n \nThe following thesis will be divided into two major parts: an analysis \nof the LGBTQ* movement’s social media activism during the Obama \npresidency and a socio-economic as well as a socio-political analysis that \nshows in what way the movement has been influenced by social as well as \nneoliberal virtues and politics and vice versa.  \nOver the course of the first part, it will be illuminated which \nstrategies the LGBTQ* movement has applied to expose inequality and \nviolence and how these methods have contributed to the construction of a \ncollective identity. It will outline in what way the major social media \nnetworks – Facebook, Twitter and YouTube – serve the purpose of creating \nawareness and securing visibility. It will be shown how manifestations of \ninequality and violence are used to appeal to potential supporters and to \nconstruct a social media movement targeting inequality and violence. The \nchapters of the first part will delineate the strategic attempt to inscribe self-\nworth and to secure power by exposing the unequal structures affecting the \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    9 \n \ncommunity. It concentrates on the appliance of social media tools by gay \nrights activists to expose inequality and violence and to transform these \nmanifestations into a source of power for the LGTBQ* movement. \nHowever, this analysis will also expose the shortcomings of the current \nmovement especially in regards to physical violence and manifestations that \naffect only particular vulnerable individuals of the LGBTQ* community.  \nOver the course of this thesis, I will analyze the movement’s \nactivism in the light of the construct of Johan Galtung’s violence triangle. \nThe sociologist’s approach integrates a broader and more-inclusive \ndefinition of violence that is not exclusively restricted to physical acts. \nInstead, it acknowledges acts of violence that can be defined as “structural” \nimplying that a society’s system and structure disadvantages specific groups \nin a way that leads to mental as well as physical implications harmful for the \ngroup and any individual who is part of it. I will delineate in the second part \nthat the application of the violence triangle bears a variety of opportunities \nthat have not been recognized by LGBTQ* activists so far. An accurately \ndefined movement against direct and structural violence could be the \nmanifestation of politics that would not exclusively work on deconstructing \nheteronormativity but would also have the far-reaching effect of \ndiversifying the movement and counteracting certain virtues nurtured by a \nneoliberal society. Even though the era of neoliberalism has contributed to \nthe visibility and tolerance of homosexuals and transsexuals, since the \nLGBTQ* community has been attributed a huge potential as a major \nconsumer group14, the virtues facilitated by the politics of neoliberalism are \nbecoming a threat to gay rights in the United States. The era of \nneoliberalism has promoted individualism but also inequality and a climate \nof competition. Egotism and self-interest have become the core values of \nWestern societies, including the United States. This has not only been \npromoted by individuals but also by the U.S. legislative, executive and \njudicial bodies themselves. Egotism and ignorance also penetrates the \n                                                 \n14 More on the construction of LGBTQ*s as consumers by the neoliberal developments in: \nMichael Kimmel and Cheryl Llewellyn, “Homosexuality, Gender Nonconformity, and the \nNeoliberal State,” Journal of Homosexuality, 59:1087–1094, 2012. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    10 \n \nmovement and is a major threat to the cohesion and success of the LGBTQ* \ncommunity which will be exposed over the course of this thesis.  \nHowever, I will also illuminate how the LGBTQ* movement has the \nability to counter the climate of egotism and non-intervention by adapting \nthe language of structural and direct violence. Moreover, it will be exposed \nthat the rhetoric of the violence triangle could be the necessary tool to \ncounteract the peril of the emerging conservative movement and populist \npolitics. It will also show that the violence triangle could contribute to \nraising awareness for the essential inclusion of direct violence into the \nLGBTQ* movement’s social media activism. The violence triangle is \ntherefore a potential tool to challenge the shortcomings of the LGBTQ* \nmovement and this paper will clearly illuminate this capability.   \nIn the second part, it will ultimately be shown that the theory of \ncultural, structural and direct violence can be efficiently applied to the \nLGBTQ* movement and even strengthen its cohesion and diversity. Still, I \nwill also state that an overemphasis and an incorrect application of the \nviolence triangle can and must be prevented since this would otherwise \ncome at the risk of the radicalization of the movement which would make it \nvulnerable and polarize society even further. Nevertheless, under the right \ncircumstances, the adaptation of the violence triangle bears the chance to \ntighten the movement, to challenge its shortcomings and to create a strategy \nthat can work efficiently against the imminent anti-LGBTQ* legislations \nand conservative movement in the United States. This thesis is supposed to \nbe a comprehensive analysis of the LGBTQ* movement’s struggle against \nthe victimization of gays and lesbians and also of the attempt to counteract \nthe movement’s evolution towards egotism and radicalization. \nThe urgent need for the appliance of the violence triangle will be \nascribed to the social and economic developments during the term of the \nObama administration which will be also examined closely in the thesis’ \nsecond part. The purpose for integrating an analysis of the socio-political \nand economic developments is twofold: It will expose the close relationship \nbetween the Obama administration and the LGBTQ* movement as well as \nthe community’s dependence on the administration’s support which has now \nbeen eliminated. Moreover, it will eventually serve the purpose of \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    11 \n \nexplaining the political transformation that has led – among others – to the \nelection of Donald Trump; an election that jeopardizes the rights of \nLGBTQ* Americans. The coming years will see political and judicial \nchallenges to LGBTQ* rights and bear the risk that the community will face \nopen revulsion by opponents and simultaneously ignorance by Donald \nTrump and his administration. These developments imperil the \nachievements of the LGBTQ* community and must therefore be countered \nby applying efficient strategies. The violence triangle represents one \npotential tool. \n \n2. Methodology and Scope of the Study \n \nSocial media constitute the sources from which a majority of people extract \nlatest information nowadays. The importance of social media and its \nrelevance in political discourses has steadily increased over the last \ndecade.15 Politicians as well as interest groups have harnessed social media \nto influence the public. Barack Obama was the first presidential candidate to \nimplement Twitter in his election campaign in 2007 and many politicians up \nto Donald Trump followed. Social media provides a synopsis of reactions to \nsocial, political, economic and cultural circumstances and developments. \nThus, the analysis of social media content distributed by gay rights activists \nis a reaction to the rising importance of these tools and its reflection of \ninternal and external conditions that affect the United States.  \nThis dissertation will approach the topic of violence against LGB*s \ninterdisciplinary since I feel that focusing on only one branch of academia \nleads to the misrecognition of the interconnectedness of social and political \ndevelopments in a globalized world and would not adequately serve the \nanalysis of the LGBTQ* movement’s struggle against violence. \nNevertheless, the main focus will be on the construction of a collective \nidentity, the raising of awareness in social media and the potential \n                                                 \n15 Maeve Duggan and Aaron Smith, “The Political Environment on Social Media,” Pew \nResearch Center, October 25, 2016, accessed February 25, 2017, \nhttp://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/25/the-political-environment-on-social-media/. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    12 \n \ncontainment of neoliberal virtues by acts of political activism and an \nintegration of Galtung’s violence triangle. I will exclusively explore the \nstrategy of LGBTQ* activists but thereby also analyze the evolution of \nviolence initiated by LGB opponents. I will solely concentrate on the three \nmost influential social media networks nowadays: Twitter, YouTube and \nFacebook. All three of them have been founded between 2004 and 2006 and \nkicked off the era of the participatory internet, Web 2.0. Instagram, that \ncurrently has even more users than Twitter, is not part of the analysis since \nthe service only started in 2010 and did not provide any profile pages until it \nhas been absorbed by Facebook in 2012. Since this thesis focuses on the \nyears between 2009 and 2017 the inclusion of Instagram would entail a gap \nof three years (2009 to 2012) during which an analysis would not be \napplicable. In addition, Facebook and Twitter have established themselves \nas the most important social media forums in the political context; a \ndevelopment that Instagram has not experienced so far.16  \nStatistics about social platform users are difficult to extract since \ncompanies keep information vague and hardly offer any detailed \ndemographic data.17 However, according to a Pew Research from November \n2016, 79 percent of online U.S. Americans18 use Facebook. The Research \nCenter states that in November 2016 86 percent of Americans used the \ninternet. This means that 255,939,959 of the United States’ resident \npopulation were using Facebook at that moment in time.19 The percentage \nof those U.S. Americans who are online and use Facebook saw an increase \nof 13 percent from 2010.  \nAt the same time, the Pew Research Center found that 24 percent of \nonline U.S. Americans were using Twitter which constitutes about \n77,753,912 of the United States’ resident population.

More: U.S. \nCensus Bureau, “National Population Totals Tables: 2010-2016 – Monthly Population \nEstimates for the United States: April 1, 2010 to December 1, 2017,” accessed February 24, \n2017, https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2016/demo/popest/nation-total.html.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    13 \n \nTwitter users comes to 16 percent within six years (2010 to 2016). We do \nnot know how many LGB people use Twitter or Facebook but if we \nassumed that the number is proportional to its share of the overall LGB \npopulation in society, we can presume that 8,957,898 LGB people use \nFacebook and 2,721,387 use Twitter.20 However, these are only vague \nestimates that do neither include LGB’s online consumption habits nor \nfactors like age, gender, place of residence, standard of education et cetera \nthat influence the use of social media and one’s behavior online.  \nStill, surveys have shown that the percentage of Facebook and \nTwitter users is higher among younger generations. While only 62 percent \nof those people online actively use Facebook, this share already reaches 72 \npercent among 50 to 64 year old Internet users. Furthermore, the number \nincreases to 84 percent of those between the ages of 30 and 49 years and \nculminates to 88 percent among those between 18 and 29 years of age. The \nlatest figures for adolescents using Facebook were stated as 73 percent for \nthose between 12 and 17 years in 2014.21 Numbers for adolescent Twitter \nusers are not known. \nWhile it is already challenging to find statistics on Facebook and \nTwitter users, it is almost impossible to determine how many people \nactively use YouTube. This platform has always defined itself as an open-\naccess platform one does not have to register with for watching video clips \n(only for uploading those). According to YouTube, the platform has over a \nbillion users worldwide. However, narrowing down this figure to YouTube \nusers in the United States is unfeasible and any attempt to do so as part of \nthis thesis would only result in inaccuracy.  \nThe approach to the primary sources included in this thesis is \nstrongly tied to the accessibility of the material. The principal focus was laid \non the detection of social media content that had a high relevance within the \nrealm of social media. Social media content is only valuable if it shows a \nhigh distribution among users and can be easily accessed, shared and \ncommented on. This condition can only be guaranteed if Twitter or \n                                                 \n20 Taken that 3.5 percent of the U.S. population identifies as LGB.  \n21 Aaron Smith, “6 New Facts About Facebook,” Pew Research Center, February 3, 2014, \naccessed February 25, 2017, http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/6-new-\nfacts-about-facebook/.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    14 \n \nYouTube searches list tweets and videos among the first results. Moreover, \nthe relevance of tweets, videos and Facebook posts were additionally \nconsidered as factors determining the potential of sources to be included in \nthis thesis. The number of clicks, likes, favorites, re-tweets and comments \nhelped to define the significance of these primary sources. Furthermore, \ncoverage of online news magazines on specific cases of direct violence in \ncombination with a Twitter search for hashtags helped to determine the \nrelevance of these acts of violence. It is important to note that this thesis \ndoes not lay claim to statistical representativeness. In fact, aspirations to \ngain statistics on the prominence of hashtags and its development failed due \nto a shortage of Twitter analytics tools that provide information that go back \nfurther than a year ago. The primary sources included must be understood as \ncase studies that are supposed to integrate a broad cross-section of methods \nand strategies of activism. The analysis will expose the diversity and \nspectrum of strategies to reach social media users. It will be argued that \neach post, tweet or video fulfills a specific role in activating LGBTQ*s and \ntheir allies. The sources value is not restricted to its wide outreach but to the \ndiversity of emotions stimulated. They are exemplary for different ways to \nreach social media users. Those primary sources used are representative for \na certain strategy but they are not all-inclusive. The analysis of primary \nsources will always include an interpretation of its specific significance and \nrepresentative character. In addition, I will provide a contextual analysis of \nsocial and political circumstances which contribute to the value of these \nexemplary sources. \nThis thesis understands itself as not limited to a specific geographic \narea. Demographic characteristics are often hardly discernible on Facebook, \nTwitter and YouTube and in fact lose their relevance due to the conscious \ndecision to connect people all over the United States and worldwide \nirrespective of their origin. However, all primary sources subtracted \nexclusively concentrate on social media discourses in the United States. \nWhat can be said is that Twitter users are slightly (by a margin of 2 \npercentage points) more likely to be from urban centers than the rural area; \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    15 \n \nFacebook users, however, are as likely to be from urban centers as from a \nrural region.22  \nThis thesis also tries to integrate the diversity the LGBTQ* \ncommunities embody and to address categories of race, ethnicity, gender \nand class. The expression “communities” is used intentionally since one can \nnot assume that LGBTQ*s are part of a homogenous group.  \nNevertheless, social media does not always disclose these categories \nand the analysis has additionally indicated that gay white men are likely to \nbe disproportionally overrepresented in social media activism. Therefore, \nthe concept of intersectionality always has to be factored in while closely \nexamining primary sources. The theory of intersectionality was first \nintroduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw in the beginning of the 1990s. It states \nthat diverse identity categories are correlating and that not only one form of \noppression but many different kinds thereof act on a person and its body.23  \nI am fully aware that one can not be reduced to a single identity \ncategory. LGBTQ*s can and must not be understood as a homogenous \ngroup. Movements and its participants are diverse and goals as well as \nstrategies to reach them differ. It is undeniable that apart from the \nmainstream activism, radical movements are still to be found and contribute \ntheir share to the deconstruction of heteronormativity. The usage of the \nexpressions “community” and “movement”, however, will in the context of \nthis thesis primarily refer to the mainstream activism coordinated by the \nmajor gay rights organizations in the United States, the Human Rights \nCampaign (HRC), the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation \n(GLAAD) and Freedom to Marry. These organizations are those with the \nhighest total numbers of members and social media supporters24 and have \nshaped the course of action over the last years and decades. The \norganizations’ activism is the foundation for the analysis of social media \n                                                 \n22 Shannon Greenwood, Andrew Perrin and Maeve Duggan, “Social Media Update 2016,” \nPew Research Center, November 11, 2016, http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-\nmedia-update-2016/.  \n23 Sabine Hess, Nikola Langreiter, Elisabeth Timm, Intersektionalität Revisited, (Bielefeld: \ntranscript Verlag, 2011), 30. \n24 The Human Rights Campaign states on its website that it has more than 1.5 million \nmembers and supporters while GLAAD and Freedom to Marry have never published any \nfigures.

Any reference to “the community” refers to LGBTQ* online \nactivists on social media platforms.  \nAs stated before, strategies of individuals to counter direct violence \nare selected on basis of their representativeness for social media activism \nand combined with factors as number of clicks, likes, favorites, re-tweets \nand comments as well as their significance in LGBTQ* specific as well as \nnon-LGBTQ* specific online news magazines. Therefore, this thesis will \nnot achieve a full representation of all LGBTQ* people and it is also not its \nintention. Its intention is the depiction of the mainstream movement and its \nactivists’ strategies that determine LGBTQ*s social media activism by using \nrepresentative primary sources. \nThis thesis will almost exclusively focus on cultural, direct and \nstructural violence against gay, lesbians and bisexuals. The latter category \nunfortunately still remains underrepresented within the mainstream \nmovement. Moreover, even though transsexual people25 belong to the group \nwhich is targeted most commonly by violence it will not be part of the \nfollowing study. I am well aware of the debate of the “othering” of \ntranssexual people within the LGBTQ* community and I am very sensitive \nabout it. However, transsexuals face violence in a different way than gay, \nlesbian and bisexual people do. They are more often subject to physical \nviolence which usually exceeds the intensity, brutality and mortality of \nviolence LGBs are confronted with.26 While homosexuals often pass as \nheterosexuals to strangers, transsexuals – especially MTFs27  – are \nfrequently not able to hide the sex they were born with and are more easily \ntargeted. The reason why I will nevertheless exclusively focus on violence \nagainst homosexuals is that the dissertation thesis analyzes violence against \npeople who are not corresponding to the heterosexual sexual orientation. \nTranssexuals, however, often identify as heterosexual and comply with the \nheterosexual maxim after they have undertaken reassignment surgery. \n                                                 \n25 I do use the expression “transsexual” intentionally instead of “transgender” as the later is \nan umbrella term and can also refers to gay and lesbian people whose physical appearance \nand overall behavior do not comply with society’s expectations of someone of a certain sex. \nFor example, a lesbian’s appearance might be masculine and her behavior might not be \neasy to distinguish from a male but still she does identify as a lesbian cis-gender woman. \n26 Doug Meyer, Violence against Queer People, 83. \n27 Male-to-Female  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    17 \n \nTherefore, they are not necessarily affected by manifestations of structural \nviolence like the long-term denial of same-sex marriage and Don’t Ask, \nDon’t Tell. Instead, they face different acts of structural violence like the \ntransgender military ban which was in place since the 1970s and was only \nrepealed in 2016; or bathroom bills that have stirred debates in many U.S. \nstates for years and intend to exclude transgender people from public or \nprivate restrooms which conform to their gender identity. Analyzing \nstructural and direct violence against transsexual people adequately, requires \na comprehensive research exclusively dedicated to the discriminatory and \noffending treatment of transsexual people. This topic has to be approached \nurgently; nonetheless this thesis will not be part of the challenging project to \nanalyze violence against transsexuals satisfactorily. However, I will use the \ninclusive umbrella term LGBTQ* over the course of this thesis where it \napplies; specifically in reference to the movement fighting violence. Even \nthough I will almost exclusively use the abbreviation LGB and the \ncategories lesbian, gay and bisexual in connection with the violence \nexperienced, the mainstream movement dominated by the major gay rights \norganizations predominantly has to be understood as broad, diverse but also \nto some extent unifying; a movement in which LGBs struggle for \ntransgender rights and vice-versa. It is the LGBTQ* movement that leads \nthe fight against violence and I will be referring to it accordingly. The \nabbreviation LGB is supposed to include cis-gender people as well as \ntransgender that identify as non-heterosexual after reassignment surgery.  \nThe following dissertation thesis is structured into four major \nchapters. The first one will introduce the theoretical framework that is the \nfoundation for the analysis of primary sources and the socio-political \ncontext discussed in the following chapters. This chapter will discuss not \nonly concepts of collective identities but also of power, violence and \nultimately neoliberalism. The basis will be laid with the theory of the \nviolence triangle introduced by Johan Galtung.  \nBased on this theory, the following chapter addresses different \nmanifestations of structural and direct violence and relates it to the concept \nof cultural violence. The essence of this part will be detailed discussions of \ncase studies that illuminate the strategies or the lack thereof of major gay \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    18 \n \nrights organizations. The analysis of case studies will be divided into \nactivism surrounding manifestations of inequality that can be determined as \nstructural violence and those that can be seen as part of the category of \ndirect violence.  \nThe third part will provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and \nshortcomings of the organized activism against LGB inequality. \nAdditionally, it will offer a detailed discussion of the applicability of \nGaltung’s violence triangle. Furthermore, this part will provide a synopsis \nof the socio-political climate of the years coinciding with the presidency of \nBarack Obama, which will culminate in an examination of the changes that \nhave contributed to the rise of populist politics and the election of Donald \nTrump. Simultaneously, I will elaborate on the implications these \ndevelopments had on the LGBTQ* community. The third part concludes \nwith an analysis of the first 100 days of the Donald Trump presidency and \nhow the political climate requires a change of strategies in pursuing the \nstruggle for equality, the deconstruction of heteronormativity and the \ncontainment of violence against LGBTQ* people.  \n \n3. Theoretical Framework \n3.1 Johan Galtung’s Violence Triangle, Collective \nIdentity and Social Media  \n \nDiscussing the LGBTQ* movement’s politics requires a profound \nknowledge of the basic concepts of violence as this is the most extreme tool \nindividuals and the state can apply to demonstrate their power and exercise \nit. Therefore, diverse approaches towards violence are essential. It can not \nbe enough to define violence exclusively by a standard of physical damage \nthat can be inflicted. An important contribution to a broader and more \ninclusive differentiation represents Johan Galtung’s theories on violence in \nwhich he distinguishes violence in three different major types: Cultural, \nstructural and direct violence. Implementing the concept of “cultural \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    19 \n \nviolence” in the year 1969, Galtung created a crucial theory which is still \nvalid and fundamental for the discussion of violence nowadays. Even \nthough Galtung provides his theories of violence in the context of peace \nstudies and therefore predominantly relates them to war and martial \nsituations it is reasonable to approach his theories from a perspective that \nfocuses on questions that are not directly related to armed conflicts. \nGaltung’s definition depicts violence as something that “is present when \nhuman beings are being influenced so that their actual somatic and mental \nrealizations are below their potential realizations”28, meaning that a human \nbeing’s present situation does not correspond to her or his possible physical \nor psychological state if certain circumstances matched common \nexpectations of feasible conditions of a human being’s existence in society. \nFurthermore, this overall definition is amplified by his differentiation of \nviolence and creation of a violence triangle. Galtung starts by pointing out \nthe well-known type of physical violence on the one hand. To define the \nnature of violence as physical presupposes that a human being is hurt by a \nparticular person which results in discernible bodily impacts. An object is \nbeing harmed by a specific action conducted by a certain subject as Galtung \nconcretizes – direct violence is connected to an actual event that is taking \nplace at a particular moment.  \nOn the other hand, Galtung indicates that it is also possible to \nexercise violence in ways that do not imply physical consequences per se. \nInstead of constituting an actual event this kind of violence is considered a \nprocess. The expression he uses for this construct is structural violence. This \nconcept of violence is “built into the structure and shows up as unequal \npower and consequently as unequal life chances.”29 Structural violence is \nnot related to an immediate action but can be linked to the definition of \n“social injustice” as Galtung says.30 In his later discussion on cultural \nviolence Galtung also includes “exploitation” as part of structural violence \nsaying that exploitation either means that there exists an “unequal \nexchange” leading to a disadvantage resulting in death or a “permanent, \n                                                 \n28 Johan Galtung, “Violence, Peace, and Peace Research”, Journal of Peach Research, Vol. \n6, No. 3 (1969), 168.  \n29 Ibid., 171. \n30 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    20 \n \nunwanted state of misery”31. The means of implementing and sustaining \nviolence in its structural form are the penetration of society’s structure and \nthe subsequent segmentation. Furthermore, the targeted group is \nmarginalized and kept from other groups; a condition which results in a \npermanent role of being a victim of structural violence sometimes even \nwithout any knowledge of the overall situation. This strategy of structural \nviolence leads to severe somatic as well as psychological impacts. In \naddition, as this type of violence is part of society’s structure it presents \nitself as a stable constant which is not easily overturned or replaced by \naltering conditions that re-define society or its present concept. Structural \nviolence is usually inflicted by certain actors that are organized within a \nsystem and interact with each other. An example for an actor could be a \nstate’s government or different institutions within a state. Eventually, this \nwill become important with regards to structural violence against LGBs.  \nBesides direct and structural violence, Galtung depicts cultural \nviolence as the third component of his concept’s definition. Cultural \nviolence “can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence \n[...] and can make direct or structural violence look, even feel, right – or at \nleast not wrong.”32 Consequently, cultural violence is all about the \nlegitimization of direct and structural violence. The foundation for justifying \nboth forms of violence in our culture is diverse: religion as well as ideology, \nempirical science and formal science are potentially used as a basis. \nExploitation and repression are considered natural or normal due to these \ncultural manifestations. As a result, direct and structural violence lead to a \ndeficit of essential needs and eventually to the experience of a trauma which \nis a collective experience since it does not only affect an individual but a \ngroup of people sharing a common identity.  \n \nJohan Galtung’s violence triangle theory is not beyond dispute. \nCriticism is often directed against the difficulty of defining structural \nviolence. When does discrimination become structural violence? What \n                                                 \n31 Johan Galtung, “Cultural Violence,” Journal of Peach Research, Vol. 27, No. 3 (1990), \n293. \n32 Ibid, 291.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    21 \n \npreconditions must be fulfilled? Can every outgrowth of inequality be \nconsidered structural violence? Or to re-phrase it: Can inequality be \nconsidered structural violence at all? If so, does the definition of inequality \nas structural violence not lead to a radicalization of the discourse? All these \nremarks are valid to some extent and have to be integrated into the discourse \nof the violence triangle. \nThe German historian Jörg Baberowski, who dedicated his work to \nthe study of phenomena of violence, is among the critics of structural \nviolence. In his book “Räume der Gewalt/Spaces of violence” Barberowski \nstates: “Macht, Hierarchie und soziale Differenz sind keine Synonyme für \nGewalt [...] Die ungleiche Verteilung von Machtressourcen ist ein Modus \nder sozialen Organisation, nicht der Repression.”33 Additionally, he says: \n“Gewalt braucht Täter, um Gewalt zu sein, und Opfer, die wissen wer ihnen \nSchmerzen zugefügt hat. Niemand kann eine Struktur als Täter \nidentifizieren, und eine Struktur kann nicht handeln.”3435 Barberowski’s \ndiscussion of the violence triangle does almost exclusively focus on \ninequality resulting from class distinction and the emergence of dominant \nclasses that rule over others. This might derive from the fact that Johan \nGaltung himself concentrated on unequal structures through the persistence \nof the category of class in his essays on violence. However, this approach is \ntoo narrow and will ultimately lead to a misapprehension of the violence \ntriangle.  \nPower and violence penetrate all structures of society and the case \nstudy of violence against LGBTQ* illuminates clearly in which way \nstructural violence has to be perceived: As an unequal treatment manifested \nin a society’s institutional body and its individuals’ thoughts. It will appear \nin multiple forms but will always have an impact on a person’s well-being. \nEven though a single aggressor is not visible, contrary to Baberowski’s \nargument of the invisibility of actors, those who do not reverse the unequal \n                                                 \n33 Translation of the author: Power, hierarchy and social differences are not synonymous \nwith violence [...] The unequal distribution of power resources is representative for the \norganization of society, not for the repression [of parts of it]. \n34 Translation of the author: Violence necessitates an actor (a perpetrator) to be considered \nviolence and it requires victims who know who has hurt them. Nobody can define a \nstructure as an actor; a structure can not act.  \n35 Jörg Baberowski, Räume der Gewalt, (Frankfurt a. Main: S. Fischer Verlag, 2015), 123.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    22 \n \nstructures, those that contribute to the preservation and enforcement of \ndisadvantages of certain groups, indirectly constitute themselves as agents \nof structural violence. Subordinating LGBTQ* people can not be a tool for \norganizing society. What reason could sufficiently justify this \nsubordination? The violence triangle has to be contemplated in a broader \nsocial context. Baberowski explains that the unequal distribution of power is \ndue to different abilities and competences. Those who have received an \nexcellent education will ultimately be in a superior position than the ones \nwho did not receive an equivalent education or who do not have the same \ncapabilities.36 However, the legitimacy of this distribution of power is not \nquestioned as long as the preconditions were similar. Instead, if the \nsubordinate offers a similar performance and comparable abilities but came \nfrom a different racial background the reasons for subordination might be – \nin specific cases – disputable. If the subordinate also faces consequences \nwhich have a direct impact on his or her physical or mental well-being due \nto the subordination, one might take the concept of the violence triangle into \nconsideration.  \nNot each subordination or power imbalance must be seen as \nstructural violence. There are power imbalances that are the result of \n“organization”, that are related to one’s abilities and performance and that \nare not resulting in mental or physical impairments. To pick up on \nBaberowskis comparison of the power imbalance between students and \nprofessors: Since the latter has worked for years on his or her professional \ncareer and has acquired knowledge a student will hardly posses at the early \nbeginning of his or her academic life, the subordination of the student is a \nnatural consequence and the only reasonable one. However, the student does \nhave the chance to strive after a similar position in the academia, though, \nand definitely has to go through the same or at least a similar process of \nsubordination as the professor once had to do.  \nYet, the validity of defining the denial of same-sex marriage as \nstructural violence is in fact given. It will be illuminated in Chapter II that \nthe denial of same-sex marriage resulted in a variety of negative impacts for \n                                                 \n36 Baberowski, Räume der Gewalt, 123. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    23 \n \nhomosexual couples and their children. Not only a feeling of inferiority and \nmental problems that could result from the unequal treatment, but also the \nlegal implications, became threats to the affected LGBs’ well-being. The \nU.S. Supreme Court acknowledged an immense burden and crushing \ninsecurity that was imposed upon LGB families – often resulting in a \nclimate that was unacceptable for a loving LGB couple and their children. \nAdditionally, the loss of health-insurance coverage like in the case of the \nMcLaughlins (Chapter II, 3.2) could become life-threatening. The denial of \nsame-sex marriage contributed to a climate of heteronormativity that was \nimplemented in the legislative and judicial structures of the United States. \nThe implications of a heteronormative society for homosexuals will be \ndelineated; the assumption that heteronormativity imposes minority stress or \ngay-related stress is hardly contested among academia anymore. A diversity \nof studies came to the result that mental disorders and substance use are \ndisproportionally high among LGBTQ*s and that minority stress is most \ncertainly the cause. The existence of structural violence becomes even more \nobvious in terms of bullying of homosexuals and bisexuals as well as in the \nprevalence of disproportionally high rates of homeless LGBTQ* youths. \nThere is no “organizational reason” for subordinating same-sex couples to \nheterosexual ones as well as there is none that justifies the bullying and \nsuppression of LGBTQ* youths. Except from their sexual desire one will \nnot be able to find any significant differences – the prerequisites are \nidentical to the ones of heterosexuals. In addition, homosexuals do perceive \nan agent of the unequal treatment – the political and judicial representatives \ndenying equality and those individuals that do contribute to the preservation \nof a concept of heteronormativity.  \nThe question remains: Where is the limit in defining structural \nviolence? The key parameters have already been given by Galtung’s theory. \nOnly if the foundation for unequal treatment was laid in a society’s \nstructure, in its legislative and judicial body, can the existence of structural \nviolence be considered. Additionally, there must be a negative mental or \nphysical effect detrimental to a person’s well-being. No minority status can \njustify the structural and systematic disadvantage and the denial of equal \nrights of said minorities. Are African-Americans victims of structural \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    24 \n \nviolence because they constitute a disproportional high number of \nprisoners? If, for example, their imprisonment can be traced back to unequal \nlife-chances because they have never seen a different life than the one in the \nghettos, in which delinquency is among the only ways to make a living, then \nit appears to be reasonable to define this as a manifestation of structural \nviolence – at least if the affected African-Americans or their family suffer \nmentally or physically from the condition. Does the fact that women still \nearn less than 30 percent of the wage their male counterparts earn mean that \nthey suffer from structural violence? Well, as long as there is no clear \nindication that women’s mental or physical well-being is influenced to an \nextent that constitutes a dramatic limitation in the fulfillment of their life-\nchances, the answer is no. Here lays also the difference between structural \nviolence and structural discrimination. I would consider the fact that women \nstill earn 30 percent less than their male counterparts a manifestation of \nstructural discrimination. Structural discrimination does not necessarily \ndiscuss the consequences of its persistence. It assesses that there is an \nunequal structure that implies unequal treatment. Structural violence, \nhowever, does focus on the effects of unequal structures; it always discusses \nhow unequal treatment affects the psychological and physical well-being of \nthe ones affected; it recognizes the long-lasting impacts and the mortal force \nthat inequality might have and it lays the foundation for change.  \nDiscrimination is manifold and all the manifestations of unequal \ntreatment of LGBTQ*s that will be discussed in this thesis have to be \nconsidered as acts of discrimination. However, discrimination of LGBTQ*s \nmight be individual, institutional or structural to name only some categories \nof distinctions. Fred L. Pincus, Professor Emeritus of Sociology, who \npublished a variety of books and articles on discrimination, including \nreverse discrimination, defines individual discrimination as a behavior of an \nindividual human being of one specific identity group that intends to have a \ndifferential and/or harmful effect on the members of another identity \ngroup.37 Individual discrimination, the intentional act of one human being \nthat imposes an unequal treatment on someone else, can be found in the \n                                                 \n37 Fred L.

Institutional discrimination \nwhich Pincus defines as intentional policies of a dominant identity group or \ninstitutions targeting minority identity groups and imposing differential \nand/or harmful effects on this group can be detected in the denial of same-\nsex marriage or the implementation of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (Chapter II, 1.3 \nand 1.2). Both policies served the ambition to treat gays and lesbians \ndifferent from heterosexuals. The preservation of the legislations denying \nLGBs equal treatment was an active maintenance of policies that were in its \nessence discriminatory. The ignorance to acknowledge and to counter \nhomelessness among LGBTQ* youth (Chapter II, 1.6) or the \nheteronormative system can be considered as manifestations of structural \ndiscrimination. Structural discrimination refers to the preservation or \nimplementation of policies of a dominant identity group or its members in \ninstitutions that are neutral in intent but entail a differential or harmful effect \non minority groups. Thus, each of the manifestations of unequal treatment \nof LGBTQ*s represent some form of discrimination – it might be \nindividual, institutional or structural. What all manifestations have in \ncommon is its harmful effects on LGBTQ* people. The foundation of the \ndiscrimination LGBTQ*s have to face is in the individuals belonging to an \nidentity group that is distinctive for its sexual orientation or gender identity. \nTheir affiliation to this identity group is the source of the policies and acts \nthat inflict harmful effects. As Galtung states, structural violence is “built \ninto the structure and shows up as unequal power and consequently as \nunequal life chances.”38 LGBTQ*s often do not have the same life chances \nand equal power as heterosexual individuals and are subject to \ndiscrimination and its harmful consequences. Heteronormativity constitutes \nthem as human beings that are vulnerable to policies that entail higher rates \nof mental illnesses or HIV infections, increased risks of suicides, lower \nchances to finish school which forces homeless LGBTQ* youths into \npoverty. The advantage of Galtung’s violence triangle is that it is \ncompulsory to speak about the detrimental effects discrimination and \n                                                 \n38 Galtung, “Violence, Peace, and Peace Research,” 171. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    26 \n \ninequality have on specific identity groups. The discourse automatically \nturns to the negative implications and stirs debates surrounding solutions. \nThe violence triangle acknowledges that the responsibility lies with \neverybody who preserves or helps to implement unequal structures.   \nThese factors possess the power to construct a broad movement that \nhas the ability to confront all forms of violence against LGBTQ* people. \nViolence is always related to power and therefore, studies about power and \nits connection to violence have to be considered while analyzing violence \nagainst LGB people. Theories of the most influential philosophers in this \nsphere, like Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault are part of the theoretical \nfoundation of this thesis.39  \nThe conclusion that can always be extracted from any of these \ntheories is that power can be most effectively reached and maintained if a \nbroader movement or construct – and not an individual – is trying to \nimplement its ambition and is trying to influence and shape society’s \nstructure. Consequently, an essential step to be successful in influencing \npeople and changing structures is to organize activists in a dominant \nmovement which has the resources to promote its agenda. There are \ndifferent factors why people become part of a social movement. Francesca \nPolletta and James M. Jasper, who are both sociologists, define the construct \nof a collective identity as the most important reason for individuals to join a \nmovement. A collective identity is “an individual’s cognitive, moral, and \nemotional connection with a broader community, category, practice, or \ninstitution”40, as they state in their academic article “Collective Identity and \nSocial Movements”. The French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs has already \ndelineated the concept of a collective memory which is the essential basis \nfor the construction of a collective identity in the 1920s. The German \nacademics Jan and Aleida Assmann have further contributed to the \nelaboration of this concept and to the direct connection to the theory of \ncollective identities. A collective memory of a shared history, cultural \n                                                 \n39 For more information on these theories I recommend to read: Arendt, Hannah. On \nViolence.

Jasper, “Collective Identity and Social Movements,” \nAnnual Review of Sociology 27 (2001): 285. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    27 \n \nbackground or a mutual fate constructs a bonding that has the potential to \ncreate a collective identity.  \nEven though the collective identity differs from a person’s individual \nidentity, there are nevertheless major intersections and correlations. Still, it \nis important to remember that neither social groups nor social movements \nare homogenous. There are diverse identity categories a person combines. \nReferring to this assumption, Doug Meyer outlines in his analysis of Anti-\nQueer Violence and Intersectionality that “anti-queer violence, [...], can \ntypically be explained not only by sexuality but also by gender41, as many of \nits forms occur when LGBTQ* people “do gender” inappropriately.”42 This \ngoes back to the theory of intersectionality that was introduced by Kimberlé \nCrenshaw. Power structures penetrate a variety of identity categories and the \nculmination of specific categories influenced by these structures determines \nthe probability and strength of acts of violence. Sexual identity alone is \nusually not the exclusive trigger which makes perpetrators attack LGBTQ* \npeople. The combination of diverse categories can increase the level of \nviolence and as a consequence also the resulting damage. Every individual \ncombines several identities and their sexual one is only part of it – even \nthough it is still a major one. Therefore, every individual experiences \noppression and violence to some extent differently. Nevertheless, the \nchallenge for activists is to construct a common ground for a collective \nidentity so that LGBTQ*s can react as a coherent group against oppression. \nStill, it can and will never be a homogenous group but instead is supposed to \nbe one that is embracing its diversity. This fact requires a sensible inclusion \nof intersectionality, the consideration of categories intensifying oppression, \nthe different outgrowths of violence and the unequal level of intensity of \nviolence. Additionally, it forces activists to integrate all kinds of LGBTQ* \npeople irrespectively of gender, class, race, age and nationality. It is \nimportant to integrate as many individual stories of LGBTQ*s as possible to \ncreate a tight collective identity. A specific part of the core values the \nmovement’s activists are intending to promote and spread within society has \n                                                 \n41 And many other categories as race, class, age, nationality etc. \n42 Meyer, “An Intersectional Analysis of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) \nPeople’s Evaluations of Anti-Queer Violence,” 851. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    28 \n \nto appeal to the targeted person and create a feeling of solidarity and \nbelonging. Even though members of social movements are not alike and \ncome from different backgrounds and have definitely different attitudes to a \nrange of subjects they are still connected by the same ethics regarding a \nparticular issue; and these moral principles and beliefs create the collective \nidentity of a group. People want to contribute to the ultimate goal the \nmovement has and are thus highly motivated. Additionally, the activists’ \nintention is also to profit from the results their actions will have eventually: \n“Participation is a rational bid to gain the benefits that accrue to those who \nshare a collective identity“.43 Oppression, discrimination and violent acts are \nespecially fertile grounds for organizing people and creating a collective \nidentity. Andrew J. Pierce says: “[T]he claim that a fundamental right \npossessed by groups is the right not to be oppressed or […] the right to self-\nascription”44. In addition, groups’ members always distinguish themselves \nfrom the opposition by referencing to opponents’ acts or values negatively. \nFor that reason, the concept of oppression is also a “relational concept”, as \nPierce explains.45 In Foucault’s terms, the concept of oppression is a \nmanifestation of power relations which can be influenced by activists. If \napplied to the topic of violence against LGBs it is conclusive to say that gay \nrights activists as well as their opponents try to implement their values and \nbeliefs in society’s structure. Opponents of gay rights endeavor to protect \ntheir moral ethics by maintaining the domination and superiority – and \nviolence in its diverse forms constitutes a tool contributing to that effort. On \nthe other hand, gay rights activists organize themselves around social \ninjustices like discrimination and violence against LGB people, taking these \nrealities as a means of constructing a collective identity that is inclusive and \nvalues the community. The struggle to end oppression, the promise to profit \nfrom the positive outcome attracts people to join the battle against violence \nand discrimination. Judith Butler clarifies the influence of violence and its \npolitical meaning in „Undoing Gender“: \n \n                                                 \n43 Polletta and Jasper, “Collective Identity”, 19. \n44 Andrew J. Pierce, Collective Identity, Oppression, and the Right to Self-Ascription, \n(Lanham: Lexinton Books, 2012), 39. \n45 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    29 \n \nWe [gays and lesbians] are, as a community, subjected to violence, \neven if some of us individually have not been. And this means that we \nare constituted politically in part by virtue of the social vulnerability \nof our bodies; we are constituted as fields of desire and physical \nvulnerability, at once publicly assertive and vulnerable.46 \n \nTo get organized and to create awareness involves another concept – \nthe concept of visibility which is directly related to power. Visibility is a \ntool to control the balance of power and to adjust discrepancies. “There is \nno need for arms, physical violence, material constraints. Just a gaze. An \ninspecting gaze, a gaze which each individual under its weight will end by \ninteriorising to the point that he is his own overseer, each individual thus \nexercising this surveillance over and against himself”.47 However not \neverybody is applying “the gaze” described by Foucault correctly or even at \nall and instead, people are frequently using other means to influence power \nrelations: violence. Homosexuals’ bodies are constantly subject to society’s \nevaluation and are therefore marked by the resulting scars: „The body \nimplies mortality, vulnerability, agency: the skin and the flesh expose us to \nthe gaze of others but also to touch and to violence. [...] Constituted as a \nsocial phenomenon in the public sphere, my body is and is not mine.“48 At \nthe same time, bodies are instruments assigned with political meaning. Gay \nrights activists’ intentions are to liberate themselves, cease discrimination, \nsuppression and act against their vulnerability. Gays, lesbians, bisexuals and \ntransgender people are trying to realize their right of self-ascription by \ngaining self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem. The philosopher \nAndrew Pierce and the distinguished academic Axel Honneth, whom Pierce \nis referring to in his book Collective Identity, Oppression, and the Right to \nSelf-Ascription, have discussed the right of self-ascription extensively. For \nindividuals who are constantly subject to violence and rejection it is \nimportant to find self-confidence – meaning that an individual has to accept \nand appreciate his or her needs and wishes – and implement these as a \n                                                 \n46 Judith Butler, Undoing Gender, (New York: Routledge, 2004), 18. \n47 Michel Foucault, “Power/Knowledge,” in Power/Knowledge, ed.

At the \nsame time, self-esteem is also essential as this is the feeling that makes \npeople realize their own value, their uniqueness and turn these perceptions \nto their advantage.49 Homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender people have to \nacknowledge their own identities and undergo the process of self-ascription \n– only then will they be able to become part of a movement and a collective \nidentity. Activists have to integrate individuals in a broader movement and \nthe easiest way how to do this is by exposing every individual’s political \nimplication. Violence against LGBTQ* people transforms every individual \nhomosexual, bisexual or transgender person into a political being that has a \npoliticized body. After accepting this fact it is easy to integrate an individual \ninto the gay rights movement. However, activists have to sort out how to \nincrease the awareness of LGBTQ*s to persuade them to realize that they \nare political and that they have a massive potential to influence society. The \neasiest way to raise this particular kind of awareness is by creating visibility \nand persuading individuals that they share a collective identity that is tying \nthem together. As soon as these goals are reached, it will be possible to act \non power relations and to try to shift the power balance to the activists’ own \nadvantage. The instrument to master this challenge is by using the most \ninfluential tool that guarantees a wide range of people reached: Social \nmedia.  \n \nSo how do activists use social media to promote their cause and \nrecruit new activists? To reach people via social media demands a certain \nrepetition of the discussion of the respective issues at heart. The repeat of \nthe same pattern – in this case the high-lighting of acts of oppression – in its \nmanifold manifestations will create sensitivity for the topic over a long \nperiod of time. A recursive displaying of the matter and the elaboration of \npossible solutions will ultimately resonate in a certain action by the \nconsumer of these Facebook, Twitter or YouTube posts. In the spirit of \nAnthony Giddens, sociologist and structuration theorist, intentional actions \nlike the discussion of certain topics in social networks are acts of \n                                                 \n49 Pierce, Collective Identity, Oppression, and the Right to Self-Ascription, 60. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    31 \n \nperformances which can influence a specific process and consequently \ntransform circumstances and conditions.50 Resources like social media \ncontain the power to influence structures by performing specific actions on a \nregular basis. The power of media has an enormous potential to change \nopinions, influence people’s worldview, mobilize activists and achieve \nsocial change. Media are tools to spread information, and the incredible fast \ndevelopments of the last decades have assured the potential to cross \nboundaries. Information is no longer limited to a particular space or time. \nDigital media provides information almost regardless when and where \npeople are trying to access its content – at least in democratic, developed \ncountries. According to Giddens’ theory, media are resources and therefore \nstructures that distribute information and established opinions. Agents, \n“people who use digital media, thus conferring or withholding their \nattention”51, are restricted in their attention that they can offer for media \nconsumption. This leads to a selectivity of social media content which is \nconsumed by users and also intentionally driven by social media platforms. \nUltimately this will become important for the last part of this thesis.  \nSocial media platforms have changed the settings in which LGBTQ* \nactivists have to struggle for equal rights and an end of oppression. The \ndistribution of information has become easier and also the approach of \npotential activists. Individual beings are able to contribute to the cause and \nsimultaneously movements are able to integrate every individual into their \nstructure without them ever having met personally. At the same time, the \nhigh volume of social media content makes it difficult to stick out among \nthe masses. Gay rights organizations have to compete for the attention of \nsocial media users. An appealing collective identity that promises \nadvantages or attractive prospects for the one who joins a movement has the \npotential to reach various people. The elimination of direct and structural \nviolence can be an influential goal by which activists can be recruited via \nsocial media. Exercising violence is a demonstration of power but fighting \nviolence is as well. Social media networks are the battleground of the \n                                                 \n50 See more: Anthony Giddens, The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of \nStructuration, Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1984. \n51 James G.

This virtue and the transformation of society into an \negoistic and ignorant construct will be a significant factor of this thesis and  \nwill therefore be extensively discussed. The egotism of our time threatens \nthe mobilization of activists and the coherence of the movement. Moreover, \nit has successfully stimulated a climate that creates individuals whose \nconcern is exclusively focused on their own well-being and personal \ndevelopment and aspirations. A precondition to comprehending the socio-\neconomic occurrences of the last years is the understanding of the neoliberal \nsystem dominating Western societies. Neoliberalism is the philosophy that \nhas impacted our current economic system most severely.  \nThe theory of neoliberalism first arose at the beginning of the 20th \ncentury when the U.S.’ political leaders and its citizens were agonized by \nthe Great Depression. However, neoliberalism as a fluid economic concept \ndid not exist until the easing of the next major economic crisis affecting the \nWestern industrial world. The 70s and 80s witnessed the rise of a neoliberal \nphilosophy which was destined to dominate the political and economic \nsystem for the next decades – not only in the United States but also in \nEurope and Australia and in some parts of Asia. From the 70s onwards, the \nChicago School of Economics influenced the philosophical theory of \nneoliberalism and aligned it with economic empiricism. The expression \nneoliberalism consists of the Greek word “neo” which means “new” and \n“liberalism” – a political and moral philosophy that has reigned the U.S. \nsince Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency. The policy of liberalism was \nmeant to implement distinctive liberal values like freedom of expression, \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    33 \n \nhuman rights, rule of law and the freedom of choice. However, liberal \nthinkers, especially the Austrian Friedrich von Hayek and the philosophers \nof the Chicago School, realized that liberal values can only be maintained if \nspecific instruments and mechanisms serve as protections:  \n \n[T]echnical instruments can defend political ideas and values, but the \nreverse is not true.  […][M]arket competition could be a guarantor of \ndemocracy, but not vice versa; consumer rights could be a guarantor \nof human rights, but not vice versa; economic choice could guarantee \npolitical freedom, but not vice versa.52 \n \nTherefore, neoliberalism stands for a fluid project to protect liberal values \nby imposing an economic system that highlights the values it is supposed to \nprotect. It correlates with economic concepts that contain the approaches of \nthe free society and the free market. Over the course of the 20th and 21st \ncentury, the dominant economic concepts were the theory of neoclassical \neconomics and the Keynesian economics. The neoclassical economics’ \nbasic principle is the rule of supply and demand. Individuals choose specific \nproducts and thereby ascribe a certain worth to it. The total of the demands \ncontributes to the determination of the product’s value. The correlation of \nsupply and demand was thought of as the manifestation of liberal values. \nIndividuals practice their freedom of choice in the open market-economy \nand become a formative factor in assessing products’ prices. In addition, \nderegulation and the liberalization of entry were consequences of the \nneoclassical concept. Restrictions on financial transactions were almost \ncompletely removed.53 Privatization was promoted and implemented; the \nU.S. education system was one of the spheres where privatization was most \nmassively spread. According to the neoclassical economics, the government \nis only supposed to pursue an active role if exceptional cases accrue such as \nan economic depression.  \n                                                 \n52 William Davies, “The Emerging Neocommunitarianism,” The Political Quarterly, 2012, \nVol. 83, No. 4, 770. \n53 Heikki Patomäki, “What Next? An Explanation of the 2008–2009 Slump and Two \nScenarios of the Shape of Things to Come,” Globalizations, 2010, Vol. 7, Nos. 1–2, 70. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    34 \n \nThe approaches of the Keynesian economics integrated the \nlikelihood of economic fluctuations due to the trend towards economic \nspeculations anticipated by John Maynard Keynes. The economist has \nalways been a proponent of governmental intervention to counteract \ndepressions – especially by following the strategies of deficit spending. \nHowever, the neoclassical and neoliberal system which dominates our \ncurrent economy determined economic crises as the only exceptions – apart \nfrom that, the market should balance itself. In theory, neoliberalism, in \ncombination with neoclassical economics, would therefore be dominated by \nindividuals who efficiently use the economic conditions and try to achieve \nthe greatest possible satisfaction for themselves as individual beings. The \nconcepts presume that individuals will not exceed the level of basic needs to \nlive a fulfilling and happy life. Nevertheless, the assumption that “self-\ninterest and markets are mutually supportive”54 to realize this concept has \nbeen inaccurate. “Selfishness can spiral out of control, to the point where \nthe price system is unviable.”55 The trust system, which is a precondition of \nthe functionality of neoliberalism, was proven to be frail. Greed and \nhedonism have destabilized the system and contributed to the failure of the \ninitial aspiration inherent in the concept of a symbiosis of neoliberalism and \nneoclassical economics. The economic depression of recent times, which \nultimately emerged in late 2007 and early 2008, was a reflection of the \nselfish and ravenous economic conduct of billions of citizens worldwide. \nThe catalysts of the economic crisis were manifold. However, the housing \nprice bubble was the one which eventually sparked the global financial \ncrisis to its fullest. Speculations and subsequent increases of housing prices \nas well as high interest rates created a bubble that burst when the debtors \nwere unable to repay mortgages. The ensuing effect was a chain reaction \nthat destabilized real estate companies as well as the financial sector – first \nin the United States and soon afterwards worldwide. Major investment \nfunds as well as major stock indexes were shaken and the indexes sharply \ndeclined. In addition, the market value of commodities and housing suffered \n                                                 \n54 Davies, “The Emerging Neocommunitarianism,” 771. \n55 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    35 \n \nlarge reductions worldwide.56 Among many other consequences, the \nensuing financial crisis entailed a soaring unemployment rate in the United \nStates which reached almost ten percent in 201057, a drop in consumer \nspending and the loss of housings since debtors were unable to pay back \ntheir loans. In addition, the overall socio-political situation became unstable \nand feelings of insecurity started to dominate. Feelings of panic, anxiety and \nfear were evoked more intensely by the economic situation and might have \nbeen related to the fear of job loss.58 Frustration due to unemployment not \nrelated to one’s own job performance led to a more aggressive behavior.59 \nThe socio-political climate became rougher in the aftermath of the financial \ncrisis; a polarization among different groups within the United States \nbecame visible. The economic crisis, but also the system that has been \nprevailing over the last decades, contributed to a climate of inequality and \ninner conflict within the U.S. society. Economics explained that markets are \npareto-optimal which means: “no arrangement can improve the position of \nanyone without making worse the position of somebody else. The implicit \nbackground assumption of pareto-optimality is that markets distribute \nwealth in a just way: those who contribute the most are equally rewarded the \nmost.”60 Hence, the practical implementation of neoclassical economics \nimplicates the development of unequal structures. The gap between the poor \nand the rich population has increased over the course of the last years. The \nfact that the bottom half of the world’s population own less than one percent \nof the global wealth while the richest one percent possess more than 40 \npercent of the total assets has gained dominance.61 The Occupy Wallstreet \nMovement embraced this as its slogan emphasizing the unequal structures. \nFurthermore, this division is additionally aggravated by “changing patterns \n                                                 \n56 Patomäki, “What Next?

Selfishness became socially acceptable; the concept of hate crept \ninto politics and social interactions. The division of the U.S. citizens has \namplified and manifested itself in a multitude of social and political \ndevelopments. The era of neoliberalism is the era of individualism but also \nof egotism. While the freedoms that came with the concept of individualism \nhave been contributing to one’s individual fulfillment, the related egotism \nhas corrupted these positive effects. The cohesion of society and the aspired \nachievements for minority interest groups are at hazard. We were raised in a \nsociety that accepts and even promotes egotism. The rise of social media \neven magnified this development. One’s participation in social interaction \non Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are often simply autotelic. Self-staging \nis the core of participation. Selectivity of consumers also confines the range \nof information incorporated into ones stock of knowledge. While the \nneoliberal era also led to the advancement of gay rights as it constituted \nLGBTQ*s as consumers on the market and therefore challenged \ninequality64, it has constructed a climate that simultaneously threatens the \nperseverance of the achievements and the advancement of more rights. As \nthe social media analysis of direct violence will show, victims of direct \nviolence can not expect much support of the LGBTQ* movement.

Even though Galtung’s theory is contested, structural violence \nis, as well as direct violence against LGBs, a scenario that can be applied to \nthe discourse of oppression which could serve the LGBTQ* movement as a \nresource for the construction of a collective identity and a diversified \nmovement. Structural violence is interrelated to persisting discriminatory \nand exploiting policies within the bureaucratic, institutional and political \nstructures. The long-time sustainment of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (DADT) \npolicy and the denial of same-sex marriage constituted social injustices and \nspheres of inequality that fulfilled the conditions necessary to define these \nmanifestations as acts of structural violence. Being closeted and forced to \nlead a life of dishonesty and denial eventually culminated in a state of \nmisery for everybody affected by the DADT policy. The negligence of \nimplementing laws against the common practice of dismissing employees \ndue to their sexual orientation is as much part of the overall structural \nviolence against LGB people as the implementation of Religious Freedom \nActs in many different U.S. states that create a feeling of inferiority – \nsimilar to the denial of same-sex marriage. Additionally, the enormous and \ndisproportionally high rate of homeless LGBTQ*s is also an expression of \nstructural violence and so is the criminalization of LGBTQ* people that is \nstill happening in the United States. On the next pages I will present the \ndifferent realms in which the theory of structural violence against LGBs can \nbe applied. Furthermore, I will analyze the activists’ methods of integrating \nmanifestations of structural violence in these realms in their movement’s \nstrategy – even though they do not use the term “structural violence” \nthemselves when discussing these manifestations. In the following analysis, \nI will recursively apply the expression “structural violence” and also \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    39 \n \ndistinguish the movement’s strategies in respect to direct and structural \nviolence. This analysis will show that the LGBTQ* movement already \nsuccessfully utilizes an indirect distinction between structural and direct \nviolence which’s effect could be even intensified by integrating the terms \ninto the discourse. I will distinguish between various measures activists \nhave been taking from 2009 to 2017.  \nThe most important tactic LGBTQ* activists have been adapting to \ncommunicate oppression is by ensuring the support of influential celebrities. \nWhile the representation of direct violence has been strongly focusing on \nthe homosexual “common man” who has been experiencing direct violence \nhim- or herself, the strategy of spreading knowledge about all topics, to \nwhich one can refer as structural violence, additionally concentrates on the \ndistribution of information by heterosexuals. The representation of structural \nviolence relies massively on celebrities but not exclusively. Celebrities \nconstitute attractive agents since they have more power in reaching and \ninforming people about issues not directly related to the heterosexual \nindividual; and history has shown that LGBTQ* activists essentially need \nthe support of heterosexuals. A minority will always be as successful as it \nwill be able to gain the committed support of the majority. Celebrities have \nthe power to influence billions of people. They are constantly in the public \neye and therefore subject to evaluation. They are destined to become role \nmodels or deterrent examples. How they perform, what they say and how \nthey act can influence generations. The U.S. sociologist C. Wright Mills \nstates in his book The Power Elite which has already been published in 1956 \nthat celebrities have the power to raise awareness, to bring topics to public \nattention, establish them in the public discourse and additionally influence \nsaid discourse. The preconditions to achieve all the delineated perspectives \nhave never been better than nowadays. Social media – Twitter, YouTube \nand Facebook – are the resources which provide the basis to enact \ncelebrities’ “soft power”. The political scientist Bastian Timm explains: \n“Celebrities füllen die von [Joseph S.] Nye treffend beschriebene \nAkteursrolle in Zeiten der Informationsrevolution gut aus. Akteure nämlich, \ndie Informationen nutzen können, um ihre soft power-Ressourcen zu \nverstärken und Regierungen so direkt als auch indirekt beeinflussen können, \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    40 \n \nindem sie die Öffentlichkeit mobilisieren.”65 Timm as well as the political \nscientist Joseph S. Nye who has first introduced the theory of soft power \nconsiders the application of the concept as the ability to reach certain goals \nby using attraction, not coercion.66 The attraction people feel towards \ncelebrities and gossip can be harnessed to start a public discourse and subtly \nraise awareness. On these grounds, I will analyze the representation of \nstructural violence by the movement. I will show that celebrities – \nhomosexual and heterosexual alike – have a major role in the movement’s \nactivism but also that the “common man” is of immense value. The \ndiscourse of these analyses will be embedded in the examination of the \ndiverse manifestations of structural violence.  \nI will start by looking closely at the manifestations of structural \nviolence that were among the first challenged by the LGBTQ* movement \nduring the years of the Obama administration: The military ban on \nhomosexuals – Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. After that I will focus on the \ncontested debate of same-sex marriage in the United States which was one \nof the strongest revelations of oppression until the Supreme Court decision \nin Obergefell v. Hodges was reached in the year 2015; the ruling that has \nultimately legalized same-sex marriage in every single state of the United \nStates. Subsequently, I will delineate structural violence affecting the daily \nlife of homosexuals before I will illustrate manifestations of structural \nviolence on the basis of suicides of gay and lesbian Americans. Eventually, \nthis thesis will also discuss structural violence that can be found in the \nperseverance of a high number of homeless LGBTQ* youths and also in the \npersisting discrimination of LGB people in the workplace.  \n \n \n                                                 \n65 Bastian Timm, Die Macht der Stars: Celebrities in der Weltpolitik, (Opladen & \nFarmington Hills: Verlag Barbara Budrich, 2009), 23. \nTranslation of the author: During the era of information revolution, celebrities fulfill their \nrole expounded by [Joseph S.] Nye namely the role of important players very efficiently. \nThey are players with the capabilities to use information to increase their soft-power \nresources, influence governments directly or indirectly by mobilizing the public.  \n66 Ibid., 33. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    41 \n \n1.1 Fighting Heteronormativity – Cultural \nViolence: The Foundation of Structural and Direct \nViolence \n \nThe term “heteronormativity” was first introduced by Michael \nWarner in his publication Fear of a Queer Planet in 1991. The term is \ndescribing Judith Butler’s idea of the “heterosexual matrix” which Butler \nhas defined a year earlier, in 1990. The basic concept is the general \nperception of a binary which only acknowledges a direct connection \nbetween sex and gender. The concept of sex ascribes people a female or \nmale attribute when they are born. Gender, however, defines how people \neventually behave and present themselves in their daily interactions. The \n“heterosexual matrix” determines that if a person is born male, the general \nexpectation is that the person will have a masculine appearance and also \ndesire accordingly, meaning that he will desire women. The scenario is \nequally adaptable for people born with a female sex who are accordingly \nexpected to desire the opposite sex as well. The desire for the same sex is \nnot valid within the “heterosexual matrix”. Butler explains: “Certain kinds \nof ‘identities’ cannot ‘exist’ – that is, those in which gender does not follow \nfrom sex and those in which the practices of desire do not ‘follow’ from \neither sex or gender.”67  \nThe “heterosexualization of desire” has become the rule.68 The \nrejection of homosexuality has been practiced for several decades and long \nbefore Judith Butler created the term of the “heterosexual matrix”. The \nrejection of homosexuality and the privileging of heterosexual people have \nalso been described as sexual othering by Brian L. Ott and Robert L. Mack: \n“Here homosexual couples represent the abnormal, the other, and the non-\nideal.”69 Heteronormativity has thus been established in society’s culture, \nhas become the manifestation of cultural violence par excellence and is \ntherefore the most distinctive breeding ground of structural violence. \n                                                 \n67 Judith Butler, Gender Trouble, (New York: Routledge, 1990), 24. \n68 Ibid. \n69 Brian L. Ott and Robert L. Mack, Critical Media Studies – An Introduction, (Malden: \nBlackwell Publishing, 2010), 199. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    42 \n \nFighting the stigmatization as homosexual and abnormal requires the \ndeconstruction of the concept of heteronormativity.  \n \nThe possibility of subverting and displacing those naturalized and \nreified notions of gender that support masculine hegemony and \nheterosexist power, to make gender trouble, not through the strategies \nthat figure a utopian beyond, but through the mobilization, subversive \nconfusion, and proliferation of precisely those constitutive categories \nthat seek to keep gender in its place by posturing as the foundational \nillusions of identity.70 \n \nJudith Butler’s intention is the performance of gender trouble according to \nthe concept that someone is born with a specific body, and therefore able to \ncreate an identity and develop desires that are not predefined. Neither the \nsex someone is born with nor gender should be compulsory. Instead, gender \nis generated by repeatedly acting in a specific way and should not be \ndepended on a common expectation, an alleged natural precondition or \nsocial norm. The aspiration is that homosexuality should never again be \ndominated by a superior heterosexuality.  \nConsequently, structural violence against LGBTQ*s can only be \neliminated if heteronormativity is contested and subverted. The concept of \nheteronormativity or the heterosexual matrix is being used to justify and \nlegitimize direct and structural violence against LGBTQ*s. Cultural \nviolence is the foundation so that direct or structural violence looks and \neven feels right. The concept of heterosexuality complies with these criteria. \nDestroying the concept would result in the subversion of the justification of \ndirect and structural violence.  \nGay rights activists apply multiple forms of subverting \nheteronormativity. Gay Prides worldwide serve the purpose of \ndeconstructing this concept. The political demonstrations create visibility \nand represent the implementation and application of Judith Butler’s gender \n                                                 \n70 Butler, Gender Trouble, 46. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    43 \n \ntrouble. Gay men and women in drag subvert the common expectations of a \nperson’s gendered behavior and appearance: \n \nI would suggest […] that drag fully subverts the distinction between \ninner and outer psychic space and effectively mocks both the \nexpressive model of gender and the notion of a true gender identity. \n[…] In imitating gender, drag implicitly reveals the imitative structure \nof gender itself – as well as its contingency. […] In the place of the \nlaw of heterosexual coherence, we see sex and gender denaturalized \nby means of a performance which avows their distinctness and \ndramatizes the cultural mechanism of their fabricated unity.71 \n  \nDrag, gay pride celebrations and political demonstrations are conductive to \nthe deconstruction of the heterosexual matrix, the heteronormativity. \nHowever, gay prides and political demonstrations’ outreach – even though \norganized on regular basis – usually remains restricted to an isolated group \nthat already internalizes political activism. Therefore, the LGBTQ*’s \nmovement via social media has a higher potential to reach out to people less \npolitical who represent a group of new political activists; an activist that can \nact from home; that does not have to demonstrate on the streets. This new \ngeneration of activism is not tied to a specific location – it can be exercised \nfrom anywhere and at any time. It can be easily organized and its content is \ndistributed faster than ever before. It reaches more people and is hardly \nlimited to a geographical realm. It also has the potential to reach all those \ndiverse groups of LGBTQ*s and include the community’s diversity – even \nthough this capability has not been utilized adequately so far. This new \nactivism can stir visibility and a public debate on a daily basis. It can target \nthe heterosexual matrix but also socio-political developments of our times.  \n                                                 \n71 Butler, Gender Trouble, 186-188. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    44 \n \n1.2 Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell: Structural Violence in \nthe U.S. Military \n \nThe movement for gay rights and the fight against oppression has \nbeen subject to an immense evolution over the course of the Obama \npresidency. Activists struggling for the suspension of sodomy laws and the \nimplementation of civil unions as well as hate crime laws in the United \nStates still had to work on a grassroot basis, using the conventional media \nlike newspapers, magazines and later on online magazines. Technology was \nlimited and reaching people was by far slower and not as immediate as it is \nnowadays when someone is using social media to raise awareness. The rise \nof social media for LGBTQ* activists started with the debate about the \nhighly discriminatory Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue, Don’t Harass \npolicy that had affected gay and lesbian service members for almost two \ndecades. \nThe U.S. military has had a high standing among Americans since \nthe United States were founded. Especially during the 20th century, the \nimportance of the military has been boosted even further. Two world wars, \nthe conflicts during the Cold War, the arms race with the Soviet Union, the \ninterventions in Korea and Vietnam72 and the Gulf War contributed to the \nprominence and inviolability of U.S. service members within society. \nVeterans are not only paid tribute to on November 11th, the Veterans Day, \nbut they also receive special appreciation almost every time they reveal their \nprofession. Support for the ones who serve is expected from every loyal and \npatriotic citizen. Nevertheless, for almost 90 years one group within the \nmilitary was deprived from equal treatment and forced into denying their \nidentity or not serving at all.  \nGay soldiers have served the military as long as the United States \nexists – openly and closeted. Until World War I, gays were not necessarily \n                                                 \n72 It is undeniable that particularly the Vietnam War has stirred a debate about the \nrelationship of the American society to its military. The Anti-War as well as the \nCounterculture Movement have created a critical environment and contested the standing of \nthe U.S. military. Nonetheless, the U.S. military and its members are still greatly respected \nby a major part of U.S. society to this day. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    45 \n \ndischarged from the military: “Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth \ncenturies, the military neither officially excluded nor discharged \nhomosexuals from its ranks, and, until the late nineteenth century, neither \nhomosexuality nor the homosexual person existed as a concept.”73  \nNevertheless, the military discharged many soldiers who were \ncaught while performing oral and/or anal sex with a person of the same sex. \nHowever, in 1920 the U.S. Congress laid the basis for the enshrinement of \nthe unequal and discriminatory treatment into law by modifying Article 93 \nof the Articles of War of 1916.74 From the passing of the bill in 1921 \nonwards, sodomy was considered a criminal offense according to Article 93 \nof the Articles of War. A further step to eliminate homosexuals from \nmilitary ranks was the implementation of Article 125 of the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice. Part (a) which covered all military branches found “any \nperson … who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person \nof the same or opposite sex or with an animal” guilty of sodomy.75 \nConsensual sodomy acts were not eliminated from the definition above of \n“unnatural carnal copulation” until December 2013 when President Barack \nObama signed a legislation that abolished this particular part from Article \n125.  \nIt was also Barack Obama who eventually signed the law that \nrepealed Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (DADT). The law, which was instituted in \nFebruary 1994, was the result of an inevitable compromise of President Bill \nClinton. The presidential candidate promised to revoke any discriminatory \npolicies and codes banning homosexuals from service. This was a direct \nresponse to an order from the Department of Defense. Directive 1332.14 \ndeclared homosexuality as incompatible with military service in 1982.76 For \nhomosexuals, serving their country became aligned with the requirement to \nremain closeted, to conceal their identity and also with the fear of being \nouted and expelled from the military. Bill Clinton had the intention to ease \n                                                 \n73 Gary L.

However, Clinton’s ambitions were not \ncompliant with the intentions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the majority of \nthe U.S. Congress. The debate and the failure to challenge the ban \ncompletely resulted in a compromise, the “U.S. Code, Title 10, Section 654. \nPolicy Concerning Homosexuality in the Armed Forces” or as it is \ncommonly known: Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. The Department of Defense \nDirective 1304.26 stated that: \n \nApplicants for enlistment, appointment, or induction shall not be \nasked or required to reveal their sexual orientation. Applicants also \nwill not be asked or required to reveal whether they have engaged in \nhomosexual conduct, unless independent evidence is received \nindicating that an applicant engaged in such conduct or unless the \napplicant volunteers a statement that he or she is a homosexual or \nbisexual, or words to that effect.77 \n \nHowever, the Directive also clarified that homosexual conduct would be \ngrounds for discharging a soldier. Therefore, the Department of Defense \nmade it clear that if a service member engaged in homosexual conduct, \nsolicited someone else to engage in homosexual acts, made comments that \nindicate that he or she will engage in homosexual acts or intends to marry \nsomeone of the same sex, the service member would be discharged from the \nmilitary. The Directive defined homosexual acts as any behavior serving the \npurpose of satisfying sexual pleasure. Hand-holding, kissing, or any other \nphysical contact of a sexual nature were considered as such.78 \nEven though President Clinton’s intentions were well-intentioned the \nrealization of his idea was disastrous for the gay and lesbian service \nmembers. Albeit the fact that homosexuals had to hide within the ranks of \nthe U.S. military since the 1920s, DADT was the manifestation of anti-\n                                                 \n77 Department of Defense, Enclosure 2 of DODD1304.26: Qualification Standards for \nEnlistment, Appointment, and Induction, accessed June 13th, 2016, \nhttp://dont.law.stanford.edu/statutes-regulations/. \n78 U.S. Department of Defense, Attachment to DODD1304.26: “Applicant Briefing Item on \nSeparation Policy, 13th, 2016,” http://dont.law.stanford.edu/statutes-regulations/.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    47 \n \nLGBTQ* oppression that was discriminatory in all its aspects. Homosexuals \nwere accepted to serve their country as long as they did not come out. \nRisking their lives, fighting for the freedom of the United States, serving the \npolitical ambitions of the powerful elite was welcomed but only if gays and \nlesbians served closeted and nobody would ever realize that a homosexual \nwas supporting and even protecting them. Homosexual service members \ndecided to selflessly give their lives and serve with distinction but they did \nonly receive dignified treatment as long as they were not out. Instead they \nwere forced into hiding their identity and it was not even possible for them \nto act on their natural desires in private. Although, there was criticism and \nattempts to challenge the law, the movement against DADT was not \nefficiently organized. During the 90s and early 2000s the focus shifted \nmainly on hate crime legislations and the challenge of the sodomy law \nwhich was ultimately successfully repealed in the Supreme Court’s \nLawrence vs. Texas decision in 2003. The major attempts to revoke DADT \nwere legal challenges initiated by the ServeOut-Service Members Legal \nDefense Network which were mostly unsuccessful. The Supreme Court \nnever admitted a challenge to DADT and rejected to review the military’s \npolicy on multiple occasions.79 Furthermore, only one federal court has \nruled that DADT is unconstitutional (Log Cabin Republicans v. United \nStates, 2010). The decision was stayed afterwards by the 9th Circuit Court of \nAppeals after the Obama administration entered an emergency motion to \ntemporarily stay the decision.80 ServeOut was founded as a direct response \nto the implementation of DADT in 1993 and became the most important \norganization facing the injustices of the legislation. Since 1993 the \norganization has responded to more than 12,000 requests for assistance of \nservice members facing unequal treatment and oppression within the \nmilitary forces.81  \nIn the 2000s the importance of the Internet increased quickly. \nBetween 2004 and 2006 YouTube, Twitter and Facebook were founded. \n                                                 \n79 Jody Feder, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’: A Legal Analysis,” Congressional Research \nService, August 6, 2013, accessed June 16th, 2016, \nhttps://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40795.pdf.

In 2008 and 2009 all three \norganizations, which have established themselves as the major gay rights \norganizations, joined Twitter. Nevertheless, it took a few more years until \nthe organizations could use the value of social media professionally. \nServeOut also joined Facebook in 2009 and Twitter in 2010. Yet, the \norganization’s engagement in recruiting new activists via these social media \nplatforms was almost non-existent at that time. The few tweets bearing the \nhashtag #DADT were hardly retweeted and “liked”. In addition, there were \nno responses by other users.82 The organization lacked substantial support \nfrom society due to its ineffective use of social media. On the one hand, the \nstruggle to speak out against the legislation was also negatively influenced \nby the sheer impossibility for serving soldiers to raise their voice since they \nwould have risked their career if they had openly criticized the policy. On \nthe other hand, more than 13,000 service members have been discharged \nwhile DADT was in effect composing a group that would have qualified to \nraise awareness. Nevertheless, neither ServeOut nor any other gay rights \norganization did acquire the strategies to profit from these fates.83 Instead, \ntheir focus remained on legal challenges and protests.  \nThe power of social media was primarily attained on May 27, 2017 \nafter the House of Representatives had voted with a majority of 234 to 194 \nfor the adoption of an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act \n(NDAA) that would lead to the repeal of DADT in early 2011. The bill was \nsent to the Senate in September 2010 as well as in December 2010. \nHowever, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) filibustered the entire NDAA and \nmade it impossible for the Senate to vote on the bill on both days \n(September 10, 2010 and December 9, 2010). Instead, the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate passed the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act \nof 2010 in December 2010.

The law was certified on July 22, \n2011 by the administration’s new Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen. The struggle \nfor the repeal of DADT in 2010 was the beginning of the movement’s \nadaptation of social media as a tool to raise awareness and recruit new \nsupporters. Interestingly, no gay rights organization initiated the symbiosis \nbetween the movement’s ambitions and targets and the multiplicity of \nopportunities that social media provides. The person who laid the \nfoundation for the future effort to profit from social media outreach and its \nincredible potential to gain new supporters was the U.S. vocalist and artist \nLady Gaga.  \nStefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, or Lady Gaga as she is \nprofessionally known as, has been a supporter of gay and queer84 rights for \nyears. Shortly after Senator John McCain’s filibuster speech Lady Gaga \nresponded to the strenuous resistance towards the repeal of DADT. On \nSeptember 16, 2010 she decided to upload a video statement on YouTube in \nwhich she asked everybody supporting the repeal to call their senators and \nleave a message soliciting them to vote with Senators Harry Reid and Carl \nLevin to repeal DADT and oppose John McCain’s filibuster. In her initial \nspeech she referred to the injustice and the structural violence implicit in \nDADT.  \nAccording to SLDN more than 13,000 Americans have been \ndischarged from the armed forces between 1993 and 2009 due to DADT.85 \nPeople who were marginalized and had to rebuilt a professional existence. \nThe discharge was paralleled by the outing of the soldiers.86 It represented \nan intrusion in one’s sphere of privacy and could ruin one’s reputation or \nlife. Even though the legislation stated that the military will not “ask” \nsoldiers if they were gay, soldiers’ sexual orientation was investigated as \n                                                 \n84 An expression which is nowadays used for emphasizing the deviance from the \nheterosexual and/or cis-gender norm. It is used in a broader context than categories like \ngay, lesbian, bisexual or transsexual and understands itself as independent from \nstereotypical thinking.  \n85 The Williams Institute, “Discharges under the Don’t Ask/Don’t Tell Policy: Women and \nracial/ethnic minorities,” accessed June 18, 2016, http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/Gates-Discharges2009-Military-Sept-2010.pdf. \n86 While the term coming-out refers to a voluntary exposure of one’s sexual identity, outing \nis always involuntary and forced onto the outed individual.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    50 \n \nsoon as any implications gave reason to believe that someone was gay or \nlesbian. This also represented a leverage point for potential emotional \nblackmailing and harassment as in the case of Barry Winchell, a U.S. soldier \nwho was killed for being gay by one of his comrades in 1999. In the \naftermaths the Secretary of Defense William Cohen was required to review \nDADT, clarifying if it created a homophobic and detrimental climate.87 The \nresults of the survey indicated that anti-gay harassment was a substantial \nproblem. “80% of service members reported having heard derogatory anti-\ngay remarks in the preceding year. 37% indicated that they witnessed or \nexperienced targeted incidents of anti-gay harassment – of those, 14% \nreported antigay threats or anti-gay physical assaults.”88 DADT created a \nclimate of fear and harassment. Many gay and lesbian soldiers opted for \nhanding in a coming-out letter with the intention of being discharged. Lady \nGaga referred to all these facts in her first public outreach to LGBTQ* \nsupporters and activists: “SLDN’s advocacy proves that these soldiers are \nbeing searched. Superior’s are going through their emails and private \nbelongings; calling family members and operating based on assumptions. \nUltimately, the law is being enforced using gay profiling. And gay soldiers \nhave become targets. In short, not only is the law unconstitutional, but it’s \nnot even being properly or fairly enforced by the government.”89 The U.S. \nmilitary violated their service members’ right to privacy and created an \natmosphere of fear by conveying that the military would prosecute anybody \nwho might be homosexual. DADT criminalized gay soldiers irrespective of \none’s performance, their contribution to the successfulness and efficiency of \nthe troops or their outstanding behavior; none of these aspects could \ninfluence investigations positively. If someone was convicted for \nhomosexual conduct there was no pardon. Soldiers faced a dishonorable \ndischarge and no compensation.  \n                                                 \n87 Nathaniel Frank, Unfriendly Fire: How the Gay Ban Undermines the Military and \nWeakens America, (New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2009), 196. \n88 Sharon E.

Distinguished soldiers were unable to reveal \nwho they really were and if the truth was detected they had to cope with the \nconsequences. Lady Gaga illuminates how long-serving or promising \nsoldiers lost their job due to the DADT policy and were ostracized:  \n \nSergeant First Class Stacy Vasquez, after twelve years of service was \nouted by the wife of a cadet to whom she gave a negative report based \non his bad performance in the unit. West Point Cadet Katie Miller \nopted to leave West Point Academy because she felt pressured to \nmask her identity in school. The most shocking discovery for me was \nto hear them all say, how much they missed serving and protecting our \nnation; how they joined the Armed Forces because they believed in \nAmerica. 90 \n \nProcessing DADT equaled violence that was exercised from within \nstructures of the U.S. Defense Department. Homophobia and \nheteronormativity justified the unequal treatment of gay and lesbian soldiers \nand even granted the U.S. government the right to destroy people’s \nvocational – and oftentimes private – lives. The legislation provided \npoliticians and military personnel with the power to interfere with LGBs \nhappiness and their mental well-being. It provided them with the power to \naffect people’s minds. DADT fed lesbian and gay soldiers with society’s \nconviction that loving people of the same sex and spending your life with a \nsame-sex partner was abnormal and a legitimation for treating one \ndifferently from heterosexual people – and even a legitimation for \nexercising violence. Gay and lesbian service members experienced a \ntreatment that stimulated a feeling of inferiority and therefore constituted \nstructural violence. Lady Gaga’s video clip represented her contribution to \nlay the foundation for a better and more accepting world for homosexual \nsoldiers as well as homosexual civilians. Her call to increase the pressure on \nsenators was the first effective use of social media for gay right issues. More \n                                                 \n90 Lady Gaga, “A message from Lady Gaga to the Senate Sept 16, 2010.”  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    52 \n \nthan three million views were documented and according to the YouTube \nstatistic for this video, the peak was reached right after the clip was \nuploaded (current clicks: 3.030.326; date: June 3, 2017). People who have \nnot spent a thought on the situation of homosexual soldiers were suddenly \nstimulated to empathize with gay and lesbian service members. Lady Gaga \nset off a chain reaction. On September 18, 2010 she uploaded a playlist \nshowing eighteen videos of people that use the method the vocalist \ndelineated to influence the senators. Mostly young women and men were \nfilmed while calling their senators asking them to vote for the repeal of \nDADT. Lady Gaga initiated a movement via social media that influenced \npolitics, people’s opinion and that raised awareness. A single person used \nher soft power as a celebrity and influenced millions. She voiced the service \nmember’s emotions and pains and thereby counteracted the spirit of \negotism. Lady Gaga decided to take a stand for all homosexual soldiers \nliving closeted. She deciphered that having a liberal government behind that \nwas willing to eliminate DADT presented a major chance and that using \nsocial media would impose pressure on it. The gay rights organizations had \nnot sensed the potential of social media yet or were not able to use it \nefficiently. Therefore, the Italio-American singer decided to take even \nfurther actions.  \nOn September 20, 2010, Lady Gaga held a speech at a convention of \nthe SLDN in Portland, Maine and called her address “The Prime Rib of \nAmerica”. In her speech Lady Gaga criticized DADT in a very emotional \nand remarkable way. She started by pointing out the double standard \nimplied in the military’s policy: Serving the country, supporting and \ndefending the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \nfulfilling the oath taken when joining the military; every single aspect that \nwas a soldier’s duty and free will. However, according to DADT the high \nstandards of morale, good order and discipline as well as unit cohesion \nwould be endangered if homosexual soldiers were serving openly.91 Lady \nGaga concludes from this argumentation: “So what this means is, that \n                                                 \n91 Stanford University, “Section 571 of the National Defense Authorization Act,” Stanford \nLaw School, accessed June 20, 2016, \nhttp://dont.stanford.edu/regulations/pl103-60.pdf. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    53 \n \nthey’re saying that straight soldiers feel uncomfortable around gay soldiers, \nand sometimes it causes tension, hostility and possible performance \ninadequacies for straight soldiers who are homophobic.”92 Therefore, DADT \ncan be interpreted as a law that is based on the assumption that openly \nserving LGB soldiers would have been a burden for heterosexual service \nmembers. It implies that heterosexual soldiers are only willing to take the \noath as long as no gay soldiers are part of the unit. If so, many heterosexual \nsoldiers would claim that they were not able to serve their country due to the \ntension resulting from that. Homophobia was the foundation of DADT. \nHomophobia that resulted from heteronormativity was used to justify the \ndischarge of gay soldiers – because heterosexual service members allegedly \nwere not able to concentrate on their duty while gay or lesbian soldiers were \nin their unit. Lady Gaga delineated how heterosexual service members were \nvictimized while homosexuals were seen as the perpetrator. The vocalist \ntried to expose the contradictoriness of DADT and the Constitution of the \nUnited States: \n \nDoesn’t it seem to be that, based on the Constitution of the United \nStates, that we are penalizing the wrong soldier? Doesn’t it seem to \nyou that we should send home the prejudiced, the straight soldier who \nhates the gay soldier, the straight soldier whose performance in the \nmilitary is affected because he is homophobic, the straight soldier who \nhas prejudice in his heart, in the space where the military asks him to \nhold our core American values, he instead holds and harbors hate – \nand he gets to stay and fight for our country? He gets the honor, but \nwe gay soldiers, who harbor no hatred, no prejudice, no phobia, we \nare sent home?93 \n \nLady Gaga applies a very emotional rhetoric, one that emphasizes the \ninjustice and that appeals to the empathy inherent in all human beings. She \nshouts and gestures and accentuates her allegiance with the gay and lesbian \n                                                 \n92 Lady Gaga, “Lady Gaga’s Portland Speech,” YouTube video, 16:38.

She \nidentifies herself with the LGB soldiers that suffered from the legislation \nand her account of the harmful effects sound honest and are inspiring and \nthought-provoking. Her speech illuminates clearly – although she does not \nsay it – that DADT can not only be seen as the manifestation of injustice but \nalso of violence within one of the most important institutions of the United \nStates; DADT can actually be perceived as the manifestation of structural \nviolence. In addition to the implausibility of the law and the \nheteronormativity within the U.S. military, DADT was highly violent \ntowards the soldiers’ mental and emotional condition. Lady Gaga points out: \n“We are going to war for you and you and you and you – but not you, \nbecause you’re gay. You can risk your life for this country, but in the end, \nyou are not fighting for yourself; you are fighting for straight people. … \nYou are not included. You are not included when we say ‘equal.’ You are \nnot even fully included when we say ‘freedom.’” Gay and lesbian soldiers \nwere denied equal treatment. They could serve their country, fight for their \nprinciples but the principle of equality did not include their own rights. \nTheir service for the United States military was constrained to the condition \nthat they decided to cover and deny their true identity. They were reduced to \nsecond-class human beings and had to face injustice every single day while \nthey served, or coped with the fact that they were discharged or decided to \nleave the military due to their own homosexuality. Serving openly was not \nan option and therefore the U.S. leadership accepted the fact that thousands \nof potential soldiers did not receive the chance to protect their country. The \nmilitary leadership risked their soldier’s well-being as they were willingly \nnot accepting gay and lesbian soldiers’ manpower and sent them into hiding. \nThe stigma of being different and inferior became part of homosexual \nsoldiers’ identity – and it also influenced their daily life. A RAND94 study \nconducted in 2010 showed that LGB “respondents attributed a range of \n                                                 \n94 The RAND Corporation is a research organization that develops solutions to public \npolicy challenges.

However, studies like this one were predominantly read \nby politicians. They did not reach the general public. Instead, Lady Gaga \nwas the first person who pointed to this unjust treatment and the detrimental \neffects in social media and who openly challenged the status quo. She \nreached millions of people with her YouTube videos and speeches, she \nstipulated the course of the social movement for the repeal of DADT, she \ninspired masses and she mobilized new activists. Lady Gaga heralded the \nage of social media for LGBTQ* activists.

In the \nfollowing years more and more LGBTQ* organizations efficiently utilized \nsocial media to reach and influence people all around the world. The Human \nRights Campaign as well as Freedom to Marry became the most active \norganizations on social media platforms. Eventually, the struggle to repeal \nDADT was successful and as of July 2011 gay and lesbian soldiers have \nbeen able to serve openly in the U.S. military. However, the fight for equal \nrights was far from over. The full implementation of the new policy needed \nsome time and additionally, oppression and injustices remained on behalf of \nArticle 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Article 3 of the Act \ndefined the institution “marriage” as a relationship that could be exclusively \nentered into by two people of opposite sexes. As long as DOMA was part of \nthe federal laws it remained impossible for homosexual soldiers serving \nfederal government to receive same benefits for their spouses. This aspect of \nstructural violence U.S. military members had to face is closely aligned with \nthe topic of same-sex marriage which will be discussed in the following \nparagraphs.  \n \n \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    57 \n \n1.3 The Denial of Same-Sex Marriage and the \nWell-Being of Children: A Manifestation of \nStructural Violence? \n \nWhile the fight for the elimination of DADT represented the first \nsteps towards a more active incorporation of social media into the \nmovement, the struggle for the legalization of same-sex marriage and joined \nadoption rights on a federal level became the defining topic in this process. \nThe prohibition of same-sex marriage in many U.S. states until July 2015 as \nwell as the resistance of the opponents of the legalization was probably the \nmost obvious manifestation of unequal structures in the United States. Until \nthe U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, that codified the \nimplementation of same-sex marriage in all U.S. states, the contested debate \naffected the life of thousands of lesbian and gay couples and their well-\nbeing. In the majority opinion delivered by Justice Anthony McLeod \nKennedy on June 26, 2015 the justices emphasized:  \n \nHere the marriage laws enforced by the respondents are in essence \nunequal: same-sex couples are denied all the benefits afforded to \nopposite-sex couples and are barred from exercising a fundamental \nright. Especially against a long history of disapproval of their \nrelationships, this denial to same-sex couples of the right to marry \nworks a grave and continuing harm. The imposition of this disability \non gays and lesbians serves to disrespect and subordinate them.96  \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged that the denial of same-sex \nmarriage was harmful to every individual homosexual who did not have the \npossibility to marry his or her loved one or who had to suffer from legal \ndivergences between the different states. Obergefell v. Hodges was based on \nseveral lawsuits; among others, James Obergefell sued the state of Ohio for \n                                                 \n96 U.S. Supreme Court, “Obergefelle et al. v. Hodges, Director, Ohio Department of Health \net al.” No. 14–556, argued April 28, 2015 - Decided June 26, 2015, 22. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    58 \n \nrecognition of his marriage with John Arthur in Maryland in 2013 when \nArthur was already suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a \ndisease that eventually led to his death three months later. Since Ohio did \nnot grant homosexuals the right to marry at that time, the state’s officials did \nnot list Obergefell as the surviving spouse on Arthur’s death certificate. The \nexperience of this unequal treatment, the “othering” and the non-\nrecognition as a couple that stood together until the final end, was \nexcruciating for James Obergefell. Anthony Kennedy also referred to the \nimmense pain Obergefell must have felt: “By statute, they must remain \nstrangers even in death, a state-imposed separation Obergefell deems \n‘hurtful for the rest of time.’”97 These feelings related to the non-recognition \nas the spouse of his partner of 21 years by state and federal officials were \nthe detrimental effects of an unequal treatment that left emotional scars. The \nsame was experienced by the co-plaintiffs in this case.  \nApril DeBoer and Jayne Rowse were two of the co-plaintiffs in \nObergefell v. Hodges. DeBoer and Rowse were not allowed to get married \nin Michigan so they decided to celebrate a commitment ceremony to honor \ntheir permanent relation in 2007. Over the years, the couple became the \nfamily of three adopted children. However, Michigan does only grant full \nadoption rights to opposite-sex families or single parents. Consequently, \nonly one of the two women could become the legal parent of the children. If \nanything ever happened to the legal parent her spouse would not have any \nlegal rights when it came to their children. Additionally, the parent without \nlegal rights could not officially receive any information from schools, \nhospitals or any bureaucratic institution. The judges state in their majority \nopinion: \n \nExcluding same-sex couples from marriage thus conflicts with a \ncentral premise of the right to marry. Without the recognition, \nstability, and predictability marriage offers, their children suffer the \nstigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser. They also suffer \nthe significant material costs of being raised by unmarried parents, \n                                                 \n97 U.S. Supreme Court, “Obergefelle et al. v. Hodges, Director, Ohio Department of Health \net al.,” 5. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    59 \n \nrelegated through no fault of their own to a more difficult and \nuncertain family life. The marriage laws at issue here thus harm and \nhumiliate the children of same-sex couples.98 \n  \nIn addition to the effects on homosexual couples, the denial of same-sex \nmarriage resulted in severe emotional burdens forced on children of same-\nsex families. Instability and the feeling of inferiority as well as unequal life \nchances had negative impacts on children living in same-sex families. These \nresults recognized by the Supreme Court can be closely analyzed in the \ncontext of structural violence and might fall under the definition if certain \nmental impacts are given. Humiliation and instability can lead to an unstable \nmental condition and influence the family members’ lives negatively.  \nUltimately, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the denial of same-\nsex marriage did not fulfill the rights promised by the Equal Protection \nClause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which \nstates that it is illegal to “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, \nwithout due process of law.” Life and liberty – both were impaired by \nstructural violence enforced by the rejection of homosexuals’ desire to \nmarry and to construct a stable bondage that secures the family’s stability. \nIn addition, facing constant rejection and obstacles eventually leaves \nimprints on one’s mental state. Structural violence can result in \npsychological traumas, depressions, anxiety problems, substance abuse and \nsuicides. Studies suggest that homosexuals have a higher prevalence of \nmental disorders than heterosexuals. Explanations are often based on the \nconcept of social stress and minority stress. The assumption is that minority \nstress is unique, chronic and socially based.99 Unique implies that “minority \nstress is additive to general stressors that are experienced by all people, and \ntherefore, stigmatized people are required an adaptation effort above that \nrequired of similar others who are not stigmatized.”100 Moreover, minority \nstress is defined as chronic in respect to the understanding that social and \n                                                 \n98 U.S. Supreme Court, “Obergefell et al. v.

King et al. revealed that the risk for \ndepression and anxiety disorders as well as alcohol and other substance \ndependence over a period of 12 months or a lifetime on meta-analyses were \nat least 1.5 times higher in lesbian, gay and bisexual people. While lesbian \nand bisexual women were particularly at risk of substance dependence gay \nand bisexual men showed a prevalence of an especially high rate of suicide \nattempts.102 Mental disorders like depressions, anxiety problems, panic \nattacks and psychological distress affect the quality of life negatively. In \n2010, Bostwick et al. conducted a study that showed that a lesbian, gay or \nbisexual identity was associated with a higher probability of any mood or \nanxiety disorder. Especially gay men had a higher prevalence than \nheterosexual men of any lifetime mood disorder (42.3% vs 19.8%) and of \nany lifetime anxiety disorder (41.2% vs 18.6%). Bisexual men and women \nsuffer particularly from a “double stigma”: “Those who identify as bisexual \nface a unique stigma, which is qualitatively different than the stigma \nexperienced by lesbian and gay persons. Pervasive stereotypes and negative \nattitudes about bisexuality are present not only among the “dominant” \nheterosexual population but among lesbian and gay populations as well, \nresulting in a “double stigma” for bisexuals.”103 Lesbian women reporting \nexclusively same-sex sexual partners in their lifetime had the lowest rates of \nmost disorders among sexual minorities.104 This result might be directly \nlinked to Wendy Bostwick study in 2014 which provided further evidence \n                                                 \n101 Meyer, “Prejudice, Social Stress, and Mental Health in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual \nPopulations,” 678. \n102 Michael King et al. “A systematic review of mental disorder, suicide, and deliberate self \nharm in lesbian, gay, and bisexual people,” BMC Psychiatry. 2008, August 18; 8 (70), \naccessed January 19, 2017, doi:10.1186/1471-244X-8-70. \n103 Wendy B.

This \nfact became most obvious two months after the U.S. Supreme Court \ndecision. The county clerk Kimberly (Kim) Jean Bailey Davis decided to \nrefuse the issuance of marriage licenses for homosexual as well as \nheterosexual couples in Rowan County, Kentucky. Additionally, she did not \nallow her deputies to issue licenses either. Four couples, homosexual as well \nas heterosexual, sued Kim Davis for her refusal of issuing licenses and the \nresponsible district judge David L. Bunning ordered her to comply with the \nlaw based on the court decision Miller v. Davis. Since Davis decided not to \nobey the ruling afterwards, she was jailed in contempt of the court for five \ndays. After her release she stated that she would not interfere with her \ndeputy chief’s issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. \nNevertheless, Davis has not issued a marriage license to homosexual \ncouples since. Her behavior undermines the jurisdiction of the United States \nand subordinates judicial and administrative regulations to her religious \nbeliefs. The case has covered the news all around the world and shows that \neven though same-sex marriage has been implemented in the United States \nit is still controversial and thus affects gays and lesbians alike.  \nIn the following chapter I will analyze the contested debate \nsurrounding same-sex marriage and focus on social media activism of the \nmajor gay rights organization promoting the cause of marriage equality. \n                                                 \n105 Wendy B.

While the NGOs \nwere not yet prepared for a social media struggle at times of the subversion \nof Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell they organized themselves rapidly and efficiently \nover the subsequent years. Social media became the battleground for the \nimplementation of marriage equality. Gay rights organizations like the \nHuman Rights Campaign, GLAAD and especially Freedom to Marry \nadapted strategies that integrated all resources that could potentially \ncontribute to raising awareness. Celebrities but also the “common man” \nbecame part of the movement’s social media activism. Facebook and \nTwitter posts covered the topic of same-sex marriage, photos and collages \ncirculated all over the organization’s social media sites. The Human Rights \nCampaign, GLAAD and Freedom to Marry created a broad social media \nmovement. Founded in 2003, the organization Freedom to Marry has \nbecome one of the most influential gay rights organizations. This NGO has \nalmost exclusively been dedicated to ensuring the implementation of same-\nsex marriage. Freedom to Marry was founded by the lawyer Evan Wolfson \nwho soon established, in corporation with many ambitious professionals as \nwell as volunteers, the so-called Roadmap to Victory whose central focus \nlaid on grassroot campaigns and strategic litigation. The latter means the \ncarful preparation of lawsuits with the intention of bringing major change to \nthe legislative status quo. Freedom to Marry has usually combined the \npreparation phase for strategic litigation cases with an extensive coverage in \nsocial media. While, for example, OutServe – The Service Members Legal \nDefense Network did not adapt the potential of the social media as part of its \nstrategy to bring an end to DADT, Freedom to Marry embraced the \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    63 \n \nopportunities which Facebook, Twitter and YouTube offered. The issue of \nsame-sex marriage was the one that triggered the inclusion and extensive \nincorporation of social media in the strategy of raising awareness and \ncreating a collective identity. The rise of influential gay rights organizations \nand the adaptation of effective strategies in combination with the increased \nuse of social media by the general public laid the basis for a successful \nsame-sex marriage movement. The strategy of pursuing strategic litigation \nresulted in a strong incorporation of YouTube videos in the movement’s \nactivism. Those video clips were the most efficient tool to reach out to the \nLGBTQ* communities and the general public. They contributed essentially \nto the construction of a collective identity and the strengthening of the \nmovement. The organization appealed to the viewers’ aspiration to profit \nfrom the outcome. The videos created a bond and simultaneously spread \nLGB people’s visibility.   \n This was also the reason why personal stories and incidents of \noppression experienced by homosexual couples have been shared frequently \non social media networks over the last couple of years. It actually \nconstituted one of the most important strategies to deconstruct \nheteronormativity and raise awareness. The most efficient way to reach a \nwide coverage is by placing emphasis on unjust and unequal treatment by \nusing the resources NGOs are providing.  \nA case which clearly exposes this strategy is the video covering the \nstory of Mark Maxwell and Tim Young. Freedom to Marry uploaded the \nvideo clip “Tale of Two Dads” which delineates the experiences of the \nhomosexual couple on YouTube in June 2013.106 The Afro-American \nMaxwell had met his partner almost 23 years before the video was filmed. \nThe couple is currently raising four children who were between 13 and 24 \nyears of age at the time of the video’s release. The two gay men have made \nevery effort to start their own family and to lead a happy and fulfilling life. \nNevertheless, it was exactly this aspiration that was so difficult to achieve as \nMaxwell and Young have faced extreme difficulties in getting married and \nadopting their sons.

Instead, the state’s \nlegislative body had even implemented an amendment to its constitution \nbanning same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships in 2011. \nConsequently, at the time the clip was filmed it was neither possible for two \nmen to get married nor to jointly adopt children in their home state. The \nchallenge was thus exactly the one the U.S. Supreme Court was referring to \nin their majority opinion: Only one parent could become the legal parent of \nthe children leaving the other one without any legal rights. In addition, \nNorth Carolina denied the recognition of their marriage that was licensed in \nWashington D.C. The result was the intentional infliction of instability to a \nfamily and a derogatory treatment of a couple that was willing to take \nresponsibility for all family members’ lives and well-being. The clip became \npart of the Campaign for Southern Equality's “We Do” Campaign \ndelineating unequal treatment and seeking strategic litigation. The video \nshows Maxwell and Young as loving parents that are fulfilling every cliché \nof a functioning family. The only visible difference to a traditional family is \nthe gender of the parents. However, on a legal basis the difference was \nmuch more pronounced. The couple accentuated the violence implicit and \nthe harmful effects the legislation – especially the federal Defense of \nMarriage Act – had. DOMA was implemented in 1996 and granted every \nU.S. state the right to deny same-sex marriage via amendments to the states’ \nconstitutions. Furthermore, Article 3 of the Act defined the institution \n“marriage” as a relationship that could be exclusively entered into by two \npeople of opposite sexes. Maxwell explains the violence of the legislation:  \n \nIt [DOMA] was passed with the intent of placing groups of \nindividuals at the back of the bus to say that you are not worthy of \nbeing heard. That your voices do not count. That you do not matter. \nAnd we deeply believe that if we as LGBT couples do not demand \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    65 \n \nthat this is repealed, couples, families and children will continue to be \nharmed.107 \n \nConsequently, both take a stance against the inequality homosexuals face \nand define their intention as subverting the heteronormativity of society and \nheteronormative institutions that are so detrimental for lesbians, bisexuals \nand gays. They clearly state that they perceive the law as an instrument that \ndegrades their relationship and their family; an instrument that effects \nhomosexuals and their children and puts them in an inferior position. \nMarriage was an instrument that differentiated between people, between \nheterosexuals and homosexuals, and that imposed a hierarchy on society. At \nthat time, marriage was not only an institution that united two people who \nlove each other, it was also the manifestation of the heteronormativity that is \ndominating society and it represented the domination of heterosexuality. \n \nWeddings play out and illustrate in practice the heterosexual matrix; \nthey map it better than any diagram could possibly hope to do. A male \nwho desires a female dresses up like a man – after spending the night \nbefore with a large group of other men engaged in thoroughly \nmasculine activities. A female desires this male in such a way as to \nmake her a woman, and she spends her own night out exclusively with \nwomen, engaged in stereotypically feminine activities. [...] Thus to see \nthe heterosexual matrix, just go to a wedding.108 \n \nTherefore, the re-definition of marriage constituted a major step in \nchallenging heteronormativity and the subordination of LGBTQ* people. \nIlluminating the inequality that is embedded in the denial of homosexual \nweddings was part of the process of ending the reign of heteronormativity. \nMaxwell and Young are the parade example of gay men who are willing to \ncommit, who have started a family and who are ready to fight for their \n                                                 \n107 “Mark and Tim Continue Advocating for Same-Sex Couples,” Freedom To Marry, \naccessed May 25, 2016, http://www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/mark-and-tim-\ncontinue-advocating-forsame-sex-couples-and-families-by-marry. \n108 Samuel A.

The moment when the couple is at the County’s office asking for \ntheir marriage license and being denied this right shows the whole force of \nthe inequity and degradation. Simultaneously to a clip of their wedding in \nWashington D.C., the video of the rejection by the County Clerk to wed the \ncouple appears on the screen. Giving people affected by the structural \nviolence a face and delineating them as charismatic and lovely people that \nsimply want to marry the person they love is highlighting the injustice. The \nvideo clip has been watched 24,783 times (date: June 3, 2017) and shared \nmore than a hundred times, it was discussed on Facebook and Twitter and \nhad an impact on people. Even though 25,000 clicks do not seem to be \nmuch compared to more than 230 million U.S. citizens it has to be taken \ninto account that the mass of video clips, postings, pictures and articles \nwhich are shared and retweeted, liked and discussed is what will eventually \nbring attention. Homosexuals sharing Maxwell’s and Young’s fate will feel \nthe detrimental force of their story and will recognize the similarities to their \nown experiences. The couple demonstrates that there is a way to fight both – \nthe cultural violence that is the breeding ground and the structural violence \nthat is affecting LGBs lives. Pursuing strategic litigation and speaking out \nagainst any kind of unequal treatment is a device to gain power and change \none’s own fate. Therefore, the representatives of the NGOs participating in \nthe grassroot and social media movement are chosen wisely. The agents’ \nstory has either to be one easily to identify with or it should illuminate the \nunequal treatment of people having an impressive reputation, held in high \nesteem. Thereby, the movement tried to attract new activists and create \nawareness. \nFor that reason, the organization Freedom to Marry started a \ncampaign illustrating the unequal treatment of LGB military members and \ntheir families – often in collaboration with OutServe. Married homosexual \nemployees serving on a federal state level were denied more than 1,100 \nrights and benefits while DOMA’s Article 3 was in effect.109 This applied \nuntil the Supreme Court decision in Windsor vs. US in 2013. Thus, when \n                                                 \n109 “The Respect for Marriage Act,” Freedom to Marry, accessed May 7, 2017, \nhttp://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/Ending-Federal-Marriage-Discrimination-The-\nRespect-for-Marriage-Act. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    67 \n \nDADT was annulled, gay and lesbian military members still faced unequal \ntreatment and disadvantages. Even though they were no longer requested to \nserve closeted and to keep their relationships with their same-sex partners \nsecret, they still did not receive the same benefits after marrying their \npartners as their heterosexual colleagues did. One of the videos circulating \nin social media was the one of Captain Steve M. Hill and his husband \nJoshua Snyder. It was posted on YouTube in June 2012 and has reached \nalmost 66,000 views over the last years (clicks: 65,911; date: June 3, \n2017).110 Hill had become a public figure in November 2011 at a \nRepublican Candidacy Debate when he has been sending in a question from \nIraq asking how the candidate – in this particular case, Rick Santorum – \nwould treat homosexuals in the military. Hill was booed and Santorum \nstated that he would reinstate the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy. Freedom to \nMarry released a video in which the couple explains the consequences of \nthe Defense of Marriage Act which was still in effect in 2012.  \nHill joined the army in 1988 and has served in two wars – the Gulf \nWar (1990-1991) and the Iraq War which started with the invasion in 2003. \nHill had struggled a long time with his identity as a gay man and had faced \nmany difficulties since Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell has prohibited coming-out as \ngay and performing any homosexual acts. Nevertheless, Hill stayed in the \nU.S. Army and participated in combats always knowing and accepting that \nhe might not survive a mission. In 2010, he met his future husband Joshua \nSnyder and the two of them fell in love. A year later, the couple decided to \ndrive from Ohio which still did not permit same-sex marriage to \nWashington D.C. where they got married. Even though, the repeal of Don’t \nAsk, Don’t Tell became ultimately effective four months after their \nmarriage, in September 2011, Hill and Snyder had to suffer from \ninequalities and discrimination. In the clip, the couple refers to diverse \ndisparities they had to face while DOMA was still in place. Since Article 3 \nof DOMA defined marriage as an institution that is exclusively available to \nopposite-sex couples their marriage in Washington D.C. was not recognized \n                                                 \n110 “Booed Soldier and Husband Boo the Defense of Marriage Act,” YouTube video, 03:08. \nPosted by Freedom to Marry, June 11, 2012, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZDzOLeCWfQ. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    68 \n \nby the federal government. Therefore, Josh was not accepted as Steve’s \nspouse on a federal level; a treatment that was completely unequal to the \none Hill’s comrades experienced. As Snyder explains: “You don’t get to be \nthe first one to know that something happened. You may not find out for \nweeks that it happened. And that was tough – though that was the reality. \nThose calls [when mortar fire started] were two of the hardest moments of \nmy life.”111 The consequence of Article 3, DOMA was that spouses of same-\nsex couples were simply not recognized. They did not receive the same \nbenefits, could not list their partners as next-of-kin and they were not able to \ntake emergency leave if something happened to their partners at home. \nFederal government treated the marriage between same-sex couples as if it \nhad never been licensed and did not exist. Even though Hill spent his whole \ncareer in service for his country, defended American values such as \ndemocracy and freedom and always did his duty even in expectation of \nlosing his life, he and his partner did not receive what they were longing for: \n“A special privilege is not hiding pictures in my house or God forbid, taking \nmortar fire again and not knowing if Josh will be recognized. I’m fighting \nevery day to protect everyone’s rights as human beings, and it seems \ncounterintuitive for me to be fighting for those rights and not have them.”112 \nThe unequal treatment has left scars. Psychologically, both Hill and Snyder \nhad difficulties with coping with the given situation. The latter was always \nin fear of losing his husband and at the same time not being informed. Days \nwithout messages from Hill were excruciating and imposed a detrimental \npressure. Hill, on the other hand, was emotionally hardly able to depart from \nhis husband twice when being deployed as he had to leave Snyder in a state \nof instability and misery always knowing that Josh did not have the same \nrights as other soldier’s partners. In addition to the natural pressure \nundoubtedly tied to the deployment of a loved one, Hill and Snyder had to \nface inequalities that could not be justified in any way. The Federal \nGovernment as well as the U.S. military intentionally exposed Hill and \n                                                 \n111 “Booed Soldier and Husband Boo the Defense of Marriage Act.”  \n112 GLAAD, “Military Shows Support for Fellow Soldier, Stephen Hill,” November 21, \n2011, accessed May 30, 2016, http://www.glaad.org/blog/military-shows-support-fellow-\nsoldier-stephen-hill. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    69 \n \nSnyder as well as many more homosexual couples to anguish they were \nhardly able to bear.  \nMatthew Phelps and Ben Schock experienced the same degree of \nunequal treatment like Hill and Snyder did. The Marine Captain Matthew \nPhelps proposed to his boyfriend in 2013 when DOMA was still in effect. \nFreedom to Marry reached out to Matthew Phelps and Ben Schock to tell \ntheir story shortly after their engagement (clicks: 54,829; June 3, 2017). \nPhelps publicly criticized the double standard implied in the treatment of \ngay and lesbian soldiers: “There seems to be a contraction between serving \nmy country and my country not fully supporting my relationship with Ben. \nOurs is not the type of military family things happening easily for. The law \nprohibits the government of providing the same benefits to me and my soon \nto be husband.”113 Phelps who actively decided to join the forces after 9/11 \nto serve his country and who was deployed to Iraq from 2007 to 2008 \npointed out that his upcoming deployment to Japan bore some difficulties. \nPhelps and Schock wanted to get married before the date of the deployment; \nnevertheless, moving to Japan would have been associated with diverse \nchallenges. Schock would not have qualified for a spouse visa which meant \nthat the denial of a visa would have resulted in a protracted procedure. \nSchock would have had to leave the country every 90 days after the \nrecurring expiration of his tourist visa; simply to reenter the country and \nstart the process all over again. In addition, Phelps and Schock would have \nhad to bear the financial burden themselves. Furthermore, while the spouses \nof heterosexual service members receive assistance in finding a job in the \nnew country, Schock would not have been eligible to any support. The \nmilitary also would not have covered the costs for housing as they do for \nheterosexual couples. All these aspects were pointed out by Phelps and \nSchock and they concluded with Phelps saying: “Every day I’m reminded \nthat my marriage to Ben is different from everyone else’s marriage – and \nthat’s just not right.” Phelps and Schock were among the first families of \nhomosexual service members talking about the unequal treatment and the \n                                                 \n113 “A Marine and his soon to be husband on DOMA,” YouTube video, 02:25.

Shannon \nMcLaughlin has served in the U.S. military since 1999. Immediately after \n9/11, she was deployed as part of the Navy Reserve to the Middle East. In \n2011, she had to prepare for deployment to Afghanistan that eventually was \nnot undertaken. At this point, Major McLaughlin was already married to \nCasey and the couple was planning on starting a family. Their decision to \nmarry was – even though out of love – also a pragmatic one as Shannon \nMcLaughlin explained:  \n \nOne of the reasons that getting married was so important to both \nCasey and I was that we knew we wanted to have children. We knew \nthat it was very important to us to do all that we could to legally \nprotect our family. And there are so many protections that go along \nwith being married when you have children that happen automatically. \nYou’ll hear people say that it’s just a piece of paper, but it’s so much \nmore than that.114 \n \nUltimately, Casey was the one who became pregnant with twins and had to \ngo on maternity leave. After the children were born, she decided to stay \nhome. The couple expected that Casey would fall under Shannon’s health \ncare plan since this is applicable for heterosexual families as well. Instead, \nCasey lost her health insurance completely because Shannon’s health care \nprovider did not recognize their marriage since Article 3 of DOMA was still \neffective. “I was excluded from being a part of the family plan because I \nwas – although legally her spouse – I was a woman.” The unequal treatment \nof the family resulted in a burden that could have easily been a threat to \nCasey’s and the unborn children’s physical health or even their lives. At the \nsame time it stimulated a feeling of inferiority and created an emotional \nburden for all family members. As long as the adoption of the children was \n                                                 \n114 “A Major and Her Wife on the Effects of DOMA,” YouTube video, 04:04.

The McLaughlins eventually decided to sue Shannon’s \nemployer, the U.S. military and the federal state, in a class-action lawsuit. \nThe decision to speak about the treatment they had received resulted from \ntheir wish to gain equal rights and to eradicate their status as second-class \ncitizens. Casey stressed this aspect: “I am as much a military wife as \nanybody else who is in the military. I want to be recognized. And I want our \nkids to understand that they are the same as well.” Furthermore, Shannon \nspecified her ideal scenario for the treatment of same-sex couples within the \nU.S. military: “I [want to be] able to take my wife to military family events \nand know that she is respected, and that there is no single doubt that she is \nas good as any other military wife or husband that is there.”115 The \ndefinition of the institution “marriage” as being exclusively between \nopposite-sex couples resulted in multiple disadvantages for the lesbian \ncouple. Shannon perceived her relationship as subordinated in comparison \nto heterosexual ones’ and considered herself as a second-class soldier whose \nservice for the country was neither acknowledged nor compensated in an \nappropriate way. These feelings were shared by the other couples whose \nstories were delineated above. Facing this kind of unequal treatment on a \ndaily basis leads to a collective feeling of inferiority. Being reminded of the \ndisparities, being subject to discrimination will result in social stress and \nwill have psychological impacts at some point. What connects all these \ncouples is the decision to speak out and thereby attain power. They perceive \ntheir experiences of unequal treatment as a leverage point for their \nparticipation in the gay rights movement. The foundation for their \ninvolvement was laid by the gay rights organizations’ decision to \nincorporate social media platforms into their agenda. The creation of \nawareness was thereby tremendously increased and the severity of the \npsychological impacts and its injustice could be fully exposed. The \nmomentum of social media as a tool for gay rights organizations’ struggles \nto fight against inequality and oppression started after Lady Gaga had \n                                                 \n115 “A Major and Her Wife on the Effects of DOMA.” \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    72 \n \nhighlighted the power of social media. However, the issue that really \ntriggered the usage of social media was the struggle for the legalization of \nsame-sex marriage. Illuminating the shortcomings and the violation of \nhomosexuals’ basic rights and working for the reversal of these detriments \nis the core of the movement. Activists try to create visibility and awareness \nin addition to a collective identity that eventually turns victims of inequality \ninto activists themselves. They escape victimization by turning the \ndisadvantages they experience into a source of activism. People that live \ntheir ordinary life, that do not intend to receive any special treatment, that \nsimply want to be accepted and treated like heterosexuals generate a feeling \nof a shared fate. They convey the feeling that it is possible to influence the \npublic opinion; that everyone is able to participate in the effort to erase \ninequality and sources of structural violence. Social media are the \nfoundation of NGOs to spread this awareness and to mobilize the “common \nhomosexual” who is facing inequality day-to-day. Video clips like the one \nof Steven Hill, the McLaughlins or Mark Maxwell and Tim Young were \nproduced and distributed regularly. As a result, thousands watched the \nmanifestations of structural violence, became aware of inequalities and \nstarted to identify with the movement. The potential to easily identify with \nthe movement was laid by the telling of stories like the ones discussed. The \nvideos conveyed the impression that everybody could contribute to the \nmovement and had a voice. It created a bond and integrated a huge diversity \nof LGB people suffering from the denial of same-sex marriage.  \n \n1.3.2 Heterosexual Celebrities and their Contribution to \nRaising Awareness \n \nSharing personal experiences, creating visibility, elaborating on \nviolence that was experienced, are strategies of LGBs who are affected by \nstructural and direct violence themselves. As important as the work of \nbisexual, gay and lesbian activists is, it is indispensable to create a network \nthat also involves heterosexuals who are willing to support LGBTQ* rights, \nwho have the ability to reach heterosexuals that have never been involved \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    73 \n \nwith the movement, have never thought about the violence implicit in so \nmany structures of society. As mentioned with respect to Lady Gaga, \ncelebrities reach a wide coverage. Their soft power has the power to win \nnew supporters, to establish a broad and diverse movement, to make \nactivists’ strikes more effective. The gay rights movement in the United \nStates had to accept the reality that being joined by heterosexual activists \nwould not destroy one’s identity but strengthen the community and assure a \nfaster progress. It has taken almost thirty years to create a substantial group \nof supporters within the community that is in favor of this strategy. \nHowever, the struggle over these past decades, the developments that would \nhave never been made without the support of heterosexuals, the millennium \nof social media, all these advances contributed to the decision to amplify the \nmovement’s strategy. While we have seen that the means of raising \nawareness for the harm conducted by Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell were limited, \nthe fight for achieving marriage equality reached a completely new level. \nHomosexuals and heterosexuals alike used the social media in an \nunprecedented way and were led by major gay rights organizations. NGOs \nwere created all over the United States and became million dollar \nenterprises that reached out to celebrities, gained their support and \ndistributed the testimonies of their encouragements and endorsements.  \n \nThe U.S. vocalist Macklemore is among those celebrities who have \nillustrated the structural violence implicit in the refusal of same-sex \nmarriage and the unequal treatment of homosexuals. In February 2012, \nMacklemore released his album The Heist which included one of his most \nfamous songs Same Love. The singer who himself is heterosexual is \ndedicated to the hip hop genre – the genre which has been coined the most \nby patriarchal, sexist and homophobic views. \n \n[M]asculinity is equated with patriarchy and homosexuality is itself \nconsidered a sin, a sign of sexual deviance. [...] Hip Hop reflects the \nimportant role that homophobia plays in defining masculinity. Women \nwho are considered too independent, tough, or powerful are negatively \nlabeled as lesbians. Men insulted for being too weak are often called \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    74 \n \n‘faggots’. In this version of heterosexual masculinity, the parameters \nof manhood are being protected when homosexuality is equated with \n‘femininity’ and both are designated as weak and subordinated.116 \n \nTherefore, Macklemore’s song Same Love can be seen as an attack on the \nhomophobic and patriarchal hip hop culture. The singer who was born in \n1983 and grew up with gay uncles has illuminated the structural violence – \nnot only the one inherent in hip hop – but also in every niche of society and \nespecially in the denial of marriage equality.  \n \nA culture founded from oppression \nYet we don't have acceptance for 'em \nCall each other faggots behind the keys of a message board \nA word rooted in hate, yet our genre [Hip Hop] still ignores it \nGay is synonymous with the lesser \nIt’s the same hate that's caused wars from religion \nGender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment \nThe same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins \nIt’s human rights for everybody, there is no difference! \nLive on and be yourself.117 \n \nMacklemore covers diverse fields which are still contested, still dominated \nby discrimination and violence; the subordination of homosexuality, and the \ndominance of heteronormativity are among them. He is even referring to the \nheritage of the American people who once fought for the people’s freedom \nfrom the crown’s oppression, from ideologies and structures that \nsubordinated African-Americans. He is calling on people’s ethic and \nmoralist feelings, to the inherent will to protest against inequalities. The \nofficial video shows simultaneously illustrations of all the episodes of U.S. \nhistory, the protests against segregation, right-wing extremists like the Ku-\nKlux-Clan and the successes achieved. This might be seen critical since \n                                                 \n116 Tricia Rose, The Hip Hop Wars, (Philadelphia: Basic Books, 2008), 237. \n117 “Macklemore & Ryan Lewis – Same Love,” YouTube video, 07:03.

However, this sequence can also be \nconsidered as an indication that liberal and progressives have to rectify the \nwrong as several times before. The injustice might not be comparable in its \nintensity and malice with the racism and segregation of previous decades \nbut it is nevertheless an injustice that requires a mentality of public \ndiscourse and activism that was the foundation of fighting inequality before. \nMacklemore is appealing to peoples’ endorsement and their vigor in \nfighting the unequal treatment lesbians and gays are subject to every single \nday:  \n \nWhen everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless \nRather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen \nI might not be the same, but that's not important \nNo freedom ‘til we’re equal, damn right I support it.118 \n \nThe video clip in itself is a challenge to the denial of marriage equality. It \nshows the life of an African-American gay man living in a society that has \nstill reservations against homosexuals. It mediates the pain he had been \nfeeling as a teenager when he was not able to identify with the heterosexual \nsociety that surrounded him. The confusion and the sorrows that was \nomnipresent. It reveals the difficulties the man’s parents had when he came \nout to them, the violence he and his boyfriend faced on a daily basis, the \nstarring, the verbal vilifications, the aggression of strangers, the isolation \nand the structural violence directed against him and his partner. \nNevertheless, the video also shows the strong and loving relationship of the \nprotagonist and his partner. Additionally, it displays Mackelmore’s \naspirations, his wishes for the transformation of society into an accepting \nand diverse one in the future, for the development to the better and for the \npossibility to marry for heterosexuals as well as homosexuals:  \n                                                 \n118 “Macklemore & Ryan Lewis – Same Love.”  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    76 \n \n \nAnd a certificate of paper isn’t gonna solve it all \nBut it’s a damn good place to start \nNo law is gonna [sic] change us \nWe have to change us \nWhatever God you believe in \nWe come from the same one \nStrip away the fear \nUnderneath it’s all the same love \nAbout time that we raised up119   \n \nThe video received a wide coverage and reached hundreds of millions of \npeople.

The number of views has further increased \nover the last years so that currently 169,568,727 clicks (date: June 3, 2017) \nhave been listed on the YouTube page presenting the official clip. \nAdditionally, there are further uploads showing the video and Macklemore’s \nsong which have also received several million views. The number of \ncomments on YouTube reaches 362.933 (date: June 3, 2017) and they reveal \nthe whole range of opinions that come with the debate of same-sex marriage \nand homosexuality.  \nMacklemore has reached the general public and additionally people \nwho are usually influenced by a rather conservative and patriarchal genre; \nhe stirred a debate and shifted the focus on same-sex marriage, \nheteronormativity and sexual diversity. This effect was multiplied, when \nMacklemore’s song was incorporated in an unprecedented stance for same-\nsex marriage during the Grammy Awards in 2014. The producers and \norganizers of the Grammy Awards decided to broadcast the weddings of 33 \nhomosexual as well as heterosexual couples live on-air. The Grammy \nAward is the most important award in the music business and therefore \nattracts millions of viewers in the United States.

In addition, \nseveral video clips of the performance were uploaded to YouTube. The \nGrammy Awards’ ceremony was one of the most discussed topics in social \nmedia over the next days. Starting with Mackelmore singing Same Love, the \nhip hop singer, actress and TV host Queen Latifah wedded the 33 couples in \nan emotional ceremony which was followed by a performance of Madonna \nwho has been endorsing LGBTQ* rights for decades. The support of \ninfluential heterosexual allies is inestimable. The discussions on social \nmedia following the Grammy Awards were not exclusively positive but the \nperformance started a conversation. The issue of the restrictions same-sex \ncouples still had to face at that point was brought to light. The Grammy \nAwards was a demonstration of how society should engage with the topic; it \nwas a demonstration of how homosexuals should be treated: As equals. A \nmajor group of artists and producers allied and worked on a strategy to \nsubvert the oppression resulting from the denial of same-sex marriage. The \nperformance contributed to the destruction of heteronormativity and reached \nmillions of people who otherwise would probably never detect the violence \nimplicit in such discriminatory structures that deny gay and lesbian citizens \nequal treatment under the law. \nApart from heterosexual celebrities, gay rights organizations also \nsought to integrate the “common heterosexual (wo)man” in their movement \nfor the implementation of same-sex marriage. This campaign also \ncomprised the “Straight Allies for the Freedom to Marry” crusade. It \nincludes several video clips that show heterosexuals supporting the freedom \nto marry – often due to having a direct connection to the community but not \nexclusively. Freedom to Marry spread a diversity of video clips showing \ndifferent social groups – current or ex-military members speaking out \nagainst DOMA, Latinos emphasizing their support for homosexual family \nmembers, young conservative politicians speaking out in favor of the \nfreedom to marry or simply common students trying to recruit supporters for \nthe movement. All these short videos are the results of successful attempts \nto integrate individuals into the movement. The earliest ones uploaded are \nfrom the year 2012 when the same-sex marriage movement grew steadily \nstronger. Even though common heterosexuals do not receive nearly as much \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    78 \n \nresonance as their celebrated counterparts, their videos still recorded several \nthousands of views. Merely the fact that they, as heterosexuals, support the \nmovement and are able to identify to some extent with the virtues as well as \nwith the collective identity already constitutes a success for the LGBTQ* \nactivists. The gay rights organizations created a broad movement whose \nactivism was integrating all potential social media strategies one could \nimagine. The LGBTQ* community found a way to embrace its diversity and \ntransform it into activism. It ultimately was so efficient that the legalization \nof same-sex marriage was successfully achieved. The grassroot activism of \nheterosexuals in combination with the initiatives of heterosexual celebrities \nand homosexuals contributed to a massive social media movement \nunprecedented in respect to LGBTQ* campaigns and have been the example \nfor future struggles that were yet to be faced by the social media \ncommunity.   \n  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    79 \n \n1.4 “Maybe I can make a difference”: Structural \nViolence in Daily Life \n \nSurprisingly, lesbian and gay celebrities do not represent a major \nbasis for the organization’s struggle for marriage equality. As pointed out, \ncommon homosexuals, heterosexuals and straight famous allies became the \nfoundation of the fight of gay rights organizations for the recognition of \nsame-sex marriage. Even though individual homosexual celebrities \ncontributed to the promotion of marriage equality, there has never been a \nbroadly based crusade which singularly focused on same-sex marriage. \nInstead, lesbian and gay celebrities concentrated their effort on turning the \nmedial attention to manifestations of the overall structural violence they are \nconfronted with in daily life; and the major gay rights organizations \ncontributed strongly to the distribution of content showing celebrities’ \ninvolvement in gay rights. Homosexual celebrities’ intention has always \nbeen the deconstruction of heteronormativity by performative acts. Raising \nawareness and influencing the public discourse with the aim of changing the \ngeneral perception of LGBTQ*s serves the destruction of heteronormativity. \nInequality and violence have to be presented in a way that exposes the flaws \nof the concept of heteronormativity. Consequently, the activism of \ncelebrities is targeted on creating visibility as well as on highlighting \ninjustice. Structural violence in daily life can be best illuminated by \nhomosexual celebrities who suffer from all forms of inequality and \ndiscrimination themselves. Since 2010, the increase of homosexual \ncelebrities positioning themselves in the public debate and fighting for equal \nrights has become steadily more visible – concurrent with the rise of the \nsame-sex movement. It is not a coincidence that this development correlates \nwith the rise of the gay rights organizations’ initiated movement for equality \nin the sphere of social media. Homosexual celebrities and the major gay \nrights organizations established an efficient collaboration. \nA measure to promote the cause of equality was the performative act \nof “coming out”. In recent years there has been a massive increase of \ncelebrities coming out as homosexual or bisexual. As Foucault states the \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    80 \n \n“gaze” is the tool to keep oneself and everybody else under surveillance.120 \nThe deviation from the given norm can be detected and efficiently \ncorrected. Hannah Arendt explains: “Power is never the property of an \nindividual; it belongs to a group and remains in existence only so long as the \ngroup keeps together.”121 Each individual contributes to the preservation of \npower and simultaneously has the potential to weaken groups by \nabandoning support. Therefore, the subversion of the virtues of the \ndominating group – in this case everybody supporting the concept of \nheteronormativity – can be reached by implementing a worldview which \nrecognizes a variety of sexualities. The concept of diversity targets each \nindividual and aims to deconstruct the belief in the superiority of a \nheteronormative society. As a result, the group of the sustainers of \nheteronormativity would be impaired. The invisibility of homosexuals and \ntheir suffering must be replaced by visibility. “Devoid of visibility, power \nbecomes powerless.”122 The establishment of a concept of sexual plurality \ncan only be successfully reached if visibility is created. Visibility is the \npower that is concentrated within the LGBTQ* movement and that is \nprobably the strongest tool to subvert the existing concepts. In 2007, a poll \nof the Pew Research Center has already indicated that the acceptance of \nhomosexuals and the likelihood of people endorsing gay rights increases if \nthose know someone personally who is affected by the aligned injustices: \n“People who have a close gay friend or family member are more likely to \nsupport gay marriage and they are also significantly less likely to favor \nallowing schools to fire gay teachers than are those with little or no personal \ncontact with gays.”123 Consequently, coming out is a way of creating and \nincreasing visibility and raising acceptance as well as gaining support. \nEvery single time someone comes out to family, friends and the public the \nconcept of heteronormativity is shaken in its very foundation. A similar \neffect is provoked if a celebrity comes out to the public as a range of people \n                                                 \n120 Foucault, “Power/Knowledge,” in Power/Knowledge, 155. \n121 Arendt, On Violence, 44. \n122 Neve Gordon, “On Visibility and Power: An Arendtian Corrective of Foucault,” Human \nStudies, Vol. 25, No. 2 (2002): 137. \n123 “Four-in-Ten Americans Have Close Friends or Relatives Who are Gay,” Pew Research \nCenter, accessed May 16, 2016, http://www.pewresearch.org/2007/05/22/fourinten-\namericans-have-close-friends-or-relatives-who-are-gay/. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    81 \n \nis reached and the coverage is much higher. The era we live in makes it \npossible to reach millions of people within a short time.  \nEllen Page is a celebrity who had a wide coverage of her coming out \nat the Human Rights Campaign’s convention in Las Vegas in February \n2014. Even though the actress is Canadian, her coming out took place in the \nU.S. as her life and career’s hub are situated in the United States. Page \nstared in many different productions and received a nomination for the \nOscar award for her role in “Juno” in 2008. In 2014, Page decided to join \nthe Time to THRIVE conference of the Human Rights Campaign which is \nconstantly working on increasing the security, inclusion and mental as well \nas physical health of young LGBTQ*s. Ellen Page’s speech has been one of \nthe most emotional and touching coming outs of celebrities of the recent \nyears and exposed implicitly the violent effects from which homosexuals \nhave to suffer due to social constructs:  \n \nIt’s weird because here I am, an actress, representing at least in some \nsense an industry that places crushing standards on all of us – and not \njust young people, everyone. Standards of beauty, of a good life, of \nsuccess; standards that I hate to admit have affected me. You have \nideas planted in your head – thoughts you never had before – that tell \nyou how you have to act, how you have to dress, and who you have to \nbe. And I’ve been trying to push back, to be authentic and follow my \nheart, but it can be hard.124 \n \nPage illuminates the heteronormative standard dominating U.S. society to \nwhich the film industry has contributed as well. Hollywood has been \ndominated by white, heterosexual, Anglo-Saxon and mostly protestant \nvalues for decades. It influenced society’s expectations and standards and \nPage hints at the fact that she suffered from these principles as much as \neverybody else who is not compliant with these expectations, \nheteronormativity and the associated sex-gender-binary. However, the \n                                                 \n124 “Ellen Page Joins HRCF's Time to Thrive Conference”, YouTube video, 08:38.

And \nI’m tired of lying by omission. I suffered for years because I was \nscared to be out. My spirit suffered, my mental health suffered, and \nmy relationships suffered. And I am standing here today, with all of \nyou, on the other side of that pain. And I am young, yes. But what I \nhave learned is that love – the beauty of it, the joy of it, and yes, even \nthe pain of it – is the most incredible gift to give and to receive as a \nhuman being. And we deserve to experience love fully, equally, \nwithout shame, and without compromise.125    \n \nEllen Page tries to contribute her share to a diverse and accepting society. \nShe exposes the pain she has felt for years; the heaviness of the concept of \nheteronormativity that imposes a cruel standard on her as well as on all \nhomosexuals, often resulting in physical and psychological traumata. Her \nvoice is shaking throughout the speech and in the end she is even crying. \nWhile watching her speech one can anticipate the pressure she must have \nfelt and how difficult and simultaneously liberating her coming-out must \nhave been for her. She does not ask for being treated differently than \nheterosexuals – she demands the right to be herself.  \nSimilar experiences are also well presented by the actor Wentworth \nMiller. The protagonist of the TV show Prison Break gave a speech at the \nHuman Rights Campaign’s convention in Seattle in September 2013. A \ncouple of weeks before the event, he had come out in a letter addressed to \nthe organizers of the film festival in St. Petersburg as they had invited \nMiller to join the event. However, the actor decided to show his \ndissatisfaction with and protest against Russia’s legislations against \nLGBTQ*s by not participating as a guest of honor at the festival. Miller’s \nexperiences as a young homosexual growing up in a rural town have \naffected him deeply:  \n                                                 \n125 “Ellen Page Joins HRCF's Time to Thrive Conference.” \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    83 \n \n \nAlso, like many of you here tonight, growing up I was a target. \nSpeaking the right way, standing the right way, holding your wrist the \nright way. Every day was a test and there were a thousand ways to \nfail. A thousand ways to betray yourself. To not live up to someone \nelse’s standard of what was acceptable, of what was normal. And \nwhen you failed the test, which was guaranteed, there was a price to \npay. Emotional. Psychological. Physical. And like many of you, I paid \nthat price, more than once, in a variety of ways.126 \n \nMiller exposes the pressure homosexuals have to endure, the consequences \nof betraying the concept of heteronormativity of failing to comply with the \nexpected norm. Homosexuals often have to lead a secret life, to deny their \nidentity, to act heterosexual and to surrender every day to these acts of self-\ndestruction. Especially children, who have not found their way yet and are \nstill in the process of maturing, are confronted with this pressure. They \nadopt patterns and behaviors helping themselves to pass as heterosexual \nwhich simultaneously harm themselves. Miller was fifteen years old when \nhe tried to commit suicide for the first time; he was fortunate enough to \nsurvive. Nevertheless, he stayed depressive and suicidal even when he grew \nolder. In May 2016, Miller responded to the publication of a paparazzi \nphoto that pictured him in bad shape and overweighed six years earlier. He \nexplained via Facebook that he had still been suicidal at that time, indicating \nthat it had been difficult for him to cope with the consequences of being \nhomosexual in a heterosexual society. A variety of researches conducted \nover the last decades have indicated that the rate of suicide attempts is much \nhigher among LGB people than those identifying as heterosexual: “Since \nthe early 1990s, population-based surveys of U.S. adolescents that have \nincluded questions about sexual orientation have consistently found rates of \nreported suicide attempts to be two to seven times higher in high school \nstudents who identify as LGB, compared to those who describe themselves \n                                                 \n126 “Wentworth Miller Talks About Being Gay,” YouTube video, 10:43.

The \nparticular moment, when Miller started to accept himself and opened up to \nadapt a positive stance on his own identity was when he joined the ManKind \nProject, which “embraces multiple expressions of masculinity”130, in 2012. \nThe new insights he acquired with the help of the ManKind Project laid the \ncornerstone for his decision to come out and to tell the world about the \nstructures he has mentally suffered from: \n \nI thought if even one person notices this letter [to the Russian film \ncommittee] in which I speak my truth, and integrate my small story \ninto a much larger and more important one, it is worth sending. I \nthought, let me be to someone else what no one was to me. Let me \nsend a message to that kid, maybe in America, maybe someplace far \noverseas, maybe somewhere deep inside, a kid who’s being targeted at \nhome or at school or in the streets, that someone is watching and \nlistening and caring. That there is an ‘us,’ that there is a ‘we,’ and that \nkid or teenager or adult is loved, and they are not alone. \n \nFinally, Wentworth Miller experienced the feeling of a shared collective \nidentity and pride. These experiences helped him to adapt the strength to \nbecome visible to fight against the concept of heteronormativity that \nreinforces violence against LGBTQ*s every single day. Just like Ellen Page, \n                                                 \n127 Ann P.

He became part of the Human Rights Campaign \nand made a huge contribution to reveal the mortal force of structural \nviolence. The Human Rights Campaign uploaded Miller’s and Page’s \nspeeches on YouTube, both went viral all over social media and received \nmillions of clicks. They shifted the focus on injustices against LGB*s and, \nas a consequence, visibility rose, heteronormativity was subverted and the \nLGBTQ* movement against manifestations that generate structural violence \nstrengthened.  \nHowever, not only homosexuals but also bisexual celebrities have \nstarted to create awareness and become visible. In 2012, the actress Evan \nRachel Wood came out as bisexual on Twitter. Additionally, she provided \ninsights into the experiences of bisexual women in her acceptance speech \nfor the HRC Visibility Award in 2017 (clicks: 24,376; date: June 3, 2017) In \nher speech, she delineates her own confusion when she realized as a \nteenager that she felt attracted to women as well as men. She explains the \nfeeling of loneliness because she could not sort out what her feelings \nactually meant and ultimately describes her relief when she first heard of the \nconcept of bisexuality. Still, Wood struggled with her identity as a bisexual \nwoman and experienced revulsion from heterosexual as well as homosexual \npeople: \n \nStatistics about suicide, addiction, sexual harassment, rape, and \nintimate partner violence specifically rang true for me. And I wracked \nmy brain as to why, why were bisexuals so susceptible to these kinds \nof things? And I figured there was no better person to ask than myself, \nand the only answer that I could come back with was self-esteem. \nThere was shame about what I felt and how I identified, from outside \nthe community, and unfortunately as well as in at times.131 \n \n                                                 \n131 “Evan Rachel Wood Receives the HRC Visibility Award,” You Tube video, 13:49. \nPosted by Human Rights Campaign, February 7, 2017, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xLYTun4KaU.   \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    86 \n \nBisexuals often face lack of understanding – surprisingly not only from \nheterosexual people but also from the gay and lesbian community. She \nclearly states that it sometimes feels like there is a “competition of \nsuffering” among the LGBTQ* community and that combined with the \nrepulsion by the heteronormative society an immense pressure weighted \nheavily on her. When Wood came out on Twitter in 2012 she was \nconfronted by a Twitter user132 who could not conceive her sexual \norientation: \n \n \n \nThe messages illuminate the difficulties the user roy efc encounters and \nconcurrently expose the ignorance that is causing so much harm for \nbisexuals. Wood’s reply “Believe me, by now I am not bothered by it. :)” \n[sic] implies that there has been indeed a time when comments like the ones \nby roy efc affected her and caused negative implications. Especially in her \nearly teens Evan Rachel Wood faced hardship when it was on her to come at \nterms with her own identity: \n \nBut later in life as a teenager who had bore witness to hate speech and \ntaunting of the LGBT community I instinctually buried these feelings \n                                                 \n132 Roy efc, Twitter Post, August 23, 2012, 17:20 p.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/evanrachelwood/status/238791671553351681.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    87 \n \n[her attraction to women], I silenced my voice because I thought it \ncould safe me. On top of that there were inconsistencies to my \nfeelings because I also thought men were beautiful. And I had no way \nto put what I felt into word, I had no role model. The only thing I \nknew was fear and confusion and loneliness; how can you be who you \nare when you do not understand what you are feeling.133 \n \nWood was terrified and her self-esteem faded. Eventually she struggled with \nall the negative implications that were mentioned earlier: Suicide attempts, \naddiction, sexual harassment, rape and intimate partner violence. The \nexpression “bisexual” which she first heard in an interview by an actress \ninitiated a healing process. “The word didn’t make me feel marginalized, it \nmade me feel less crazy, it made me feel less alone; it gave me hope. […] It \nmade a world of difference in my life and in my identity.”134 The feeling of \nbelonging, of a shared – bisexual – identity contributed its share to the \nstabilization of Wood’s mental and physical situation. It ultimately helped \nher to survive. Social structures and expectations made Wood as well as \nmillions of LGBTQ*s suffer. This is also why the actress decided to create \nawareness, to use the power of visibility. She highlights that visibility \ncreates hope and that “[w]ords matter. Your voice matters. How you use it \nmatters and why you use it matters.”135 She embraces her soft power and \nsees her popularity connected to a responsibility to speak out. She envisions \nherself as the one who can speak out for those who are too terrified and \npetrified. Her coming-out as well as her speech at the HRC event does not \nonly expose the scars she has suffered but also the power she has gained \nfrom these experiences and that entitle her to subvert the heteronormative \nstructures manifested within the society of the United States.  \nHowever, not only celebrities engaged in the show business have the \npower to expose structural violence. Athletes are also in a position that is \npredestined to reach millions of people who are not aware of particular \nsituations since they are not directly involved and who would hardly engage \n                                                 \n133 “Evan Rachel Wood Receives the HRC Visibility Award.”  \n134 Ibid. \n135 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    88 \n \nin deeper analyses about these injustices. They have the power to shift the \npublic’s focus on political debates: “There is a rhetoric in sport and games: \nthey are persuasive communications, texts that, intentionally or \nunintentionally, influence the social and political attitudes held by the \npublic. [...] Sport and games rhetorically influence how we think about some \nmajor social issues.”136 Athletes participating in sport engage in a \nperformative act that has a wide range and reaches a broad coverage. “The \nathlete entering an arena is much like the teacher entering a classroom.”137 \nTherefore, openly out athletes have the ability to establish a new era in \nwhich homosexuals in sports are as common and as accepted as \nheterosexuals. Nevertheless, most professional athletes who came out \ndecided to do so after retiring from their career. The first openly \nhomosexual athletes who participated in sports were mostly female soccer \nplayers; Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe are only two to name who \nhave been part of the national team for many years (Wambach finished her \ncareer for the U.S. national team in 2015 after having been part of the team \nfor fourteen years). Rapinoe still plays in professional leagues and the \nnational team. However, the four most prestigious U.S. sport leagues are the \nMajor League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), \nthe National Football League (NFL) and the National Hockey League \n(NHL). The coverage and the influence are vividly higher if an athlete of \none of these leagues comes out as gay. The first to do so while still playing \nas a basketball player was Jason Collins in 2013.  \nOn May 6, 2013 Sports Illustrated published an article written by \nCollins himself exposing his battle of being a gay, black man who is always \nin the spotlight and trying to fulfill society’s expectations of complying with \nthe concept of heteronormativity: “When I was younger I dated women. I \neven got engaged. I thought I had to live a certain way. I thought I needed to \nmarry a woman and raise kids with her. I kept telling myself the sky was \n                                                 \n136 Rachel Kraft and Barry Brummett, “Why Sport and Games Matter: Performative \nRhetoric in Popular Culture,” Sporting Rhetoric: Performance, Games & Politics, (New \nYork: Peter Lang Publishing, 2009), 11. \n137 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    89 \n \nred, but I always knew it was blue.”138 Society’s norms and standards forced \nCollins into denial; denial of his own identity. As a consequence, the \nbasketball player became alienated from everybody he could not come out \nto – and he even became alienated from his true self: “By its nature, my \ndouble life has kept me from getting close to any of my teammates. Early in \nmy career I worked hard at acting straight, but as I got more comfortable in \nmy straight mask it required less effort. In recent days, though, little has \nseparated ‘mask on, mask off’.”139 Keeping distant is a logical reaction as it \nreduces the danger of revealing one’s own identity. Collins pursued this \nstrategy for as long as he was able to and suffered from the consequences. \nOver time he realized that he was on the wrong track and that he could not \ncontinue to uphold his masquerade for the rest of his career or even his life:  \n \nNo one wants to live in fear. I’ve always been scared of saying the \nwrong thing. I don’t sleep well. I never have. But each time I tell \nanother person, I feel stronger and sleep a little more soundly. It takes \nan enormous amount of energy to guard such a big secret. I’ve \nendured years of misery and gone to enormous lengths to live a lie. I \nwas certain that my world would fall apart if anyone knew. And yet \nwhen I acknowledged my sexuality I felt whole for the first time.140 \n \nThe concept of heteronormativity pressured Jason Collins into living a life \nof fear, desolation and emotional stress. Coming out was a performative act; \nperformative insofar that Collins finally acknowledged his own identity and \ndecided to subvert the concept that forced him into isolation and self-\nrejection. Collins’ process of deciding to come out publicly had taken a \ncouple of years. In 2012, he already felt the desire to march at gay prides \nand show his true self: “I want to do the right thing and not hide anymore. I \nwant to march for tolerance, acceptance and understanding. I want to take a \n                                                 \n138 Jason Collins and Franz Lidz, “Why NBA center Jason Collins is coming out now,” \nSports Illustrated, April 29, 2013, accessed May 17, 2016, http://www.si.com/more-\nsports/2013/04/29/jason-collins-gay-nba-player. \n139 Ibid.  \n140 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    90 \n \nstand and say, ‘Me, too.’”141 Hiding was no longer an option. Instead, \nCollins decided to take a stance, make a contribution to fight the structures \nthat imposed so much pain, that have made his life as a gay man so tough. \nCollins changed the discourse in professional sports and was finally ready to \ndefend himself, acquire power over his life and show that homosexuality is \nnot a flaw and should be just as accepted as heterosexuality is: “I’m a \nveteran, and I’ve earned the right to be heard. I’ll lead by example and show \nthat gay players are no different from straight ones. I’m not the loudest \nperson in the room, but I’ll speak up when something isn’t right.”142 He is \nthe athlete who enters the arena and educates society, the one who exposes \nthe injustice and the emotional scars lesbian, gay and bisexual people \nreceive every day by facing rejection. Social media are instrumental for \naccomplishing his fight for becoming visible and influencing people’s \npolitical attitude regarding homosexuality. The reactions on Twitter after the \npublication of the article were widespread. Not only Collins himself but \nmany of his fellow teammates, athletes, celebrities and politicians \ncommented and showed their support and appreciation. The former \npresident Bill Clinton was one of them as well as the reporter David \nAldridge, the former basketball player Kobe Bryant and many other famous \nand influential people.  \n \n \n \nThe range of people reached via social media platforms like Twitter was \nenormous and it started a public debate. Kobe Bryant’s tweet alone has been \n                                                 \n141 Collins and Lidz, “Why NBA center Jason Collins is coming out now.” \n142 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    91 \n \nretweeted more than 36,000 times.143 Posts like this spread the word and \ncreate publicity. Kobe Bryant has obviously gone through a process himself. \nTwo years before Collins’ coming-out, Bryant made news because he had \ncalled a referee “fucking faggot” during a match. His positioning in the \ndebate after Collins coming-out negated his former behavior. Celebrities \nlike Kobe Bryant influence opinions and facilitate the transformation of \nsocial structures and his tweet contributed to that. Twitter is an instrument \nthat has the potential to trigger a chain reaction and that is exactly what has \nhappened right after Collins’ coming out.  \nEllen Page, Wentworth Miller, Evan Rachel Wood and Jason Collins \nare not the only ones who stirred the discourse of heteronormativity and \nunequal treatment as well as violent structures. Over the last years the \nnumber of LGBTQ*s coming out has increased steadily. The vocalist Miley \nCyrus, the actresses Maria Bello and Kristen Stewart, the actor Jim Parsons, \nand the football player Michael Sam are only a few examples of celebrities \nwho came out as LGBTQ*. Each individual’s coming-out has contributed to \nthe boost of visibility of homosexuals and bisexuals. In many cases, the \ncoming-out was combined with a harsh criticism of the heteronormative \nsystem and an illumination of the personal consequences. The coming-outs \nalways received wide social media coverage and have sometimes been \ndebated for weeks and months. However, the most thoughtful statements \nwent public in the context of events organized by the gay rights movement. \nIt was also this combination that led to the implementation of same-sex \nmarriage. The coming-out of homosexual celebrities and the highlightening \nof the heteronormativity, of daily structures that restrict lesbians, bisexuals \nand gays; these tactics contributed to a strengthening of the social media \nmovement and created a collective identity to which many LGBTQ* people \nfelt attracted. The exposure of heteronormativity within structures such as \nfamilies, the show business or sports serve the purpose of deconstructing \nthis concept. The deconstruction of this concept in one sphere also serves \nthe subversion in another sphere.  \n \n                                                 \n143 Kobe Bryant, Twitter post, April 29, 2013, 09:01 a.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/kobebryant/status/328901917507989504.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    92 \n \n1.5 “Bye, bye mother monster”:  Anti-LGB \nBullying and Suicides \n \nThose who profit particularly from celebrities’ coming outs are \nLGBTQ* youths. As Wentworth Miller mentioned, not too long ago \nLGBTQ*s grew up without anybody to identify with and without being able \nto experience a feeling of belonging. The loneliness and the \nacknowledgment of being different and not part of the “community” led to \nalienation and a hidden life for most LGBTQ* youngsters. Suicide attempts \nwere and are still rather common during adolescence as these are the years \nin which teenagers figure out their own identity and are subject to a long \nprocess of finding their true self and their true identity. They are still \nunstable and easily influenced. Rejection is perceived more intensely than it \nwould be years later when someone has already embraced her or his identity \nand accepted oneself as lesbian or gay. Multiple studies concluded that the \nrisk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, suicide attempts, and suicide \namong LGB youngsters is significantly higher than among heterosexual \npeers. The reported suicide attempts among LGB students are twice to seven \ntimes higher than among heterosexual counterparts.144 Additionally, there \nare indications that substance use and mental disorders are more common \namong homosexual teenagers as well.145 The increased rates of suicidal \nideation and suicide attempts among LGB adolescents and young adults \nhave also been exposed by further studies.146 \nHomosexual celebrities, with whom young LGBTQ*s can identify, \ntherefore have a massive potential to face direct and structural violence and \nto improve the life of several thousands of gay and lesbian youngsters. The \nTrevor Project was already starting to encounter the undeniable threat to \nLGBTQ* youth’s lives in the late 1990s. Founded in 1998, the national \n                                                 \n144 Haas et al., “Suicide and Suicide Risk in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender \nPopulations,” 17.  \n145 Youth.gov, “Behavioral Health,” Youth.gov, accessed December 20, 2016, \nhttp://youth.gov/youth-topics/lgbtq-youth/health-depression-and-suicide.  \n146 Vincent M.B.

It offers free and \nconfidential intervention services via phone, instant messages and text \nmessages for adolescent LGBTQ*s who are considering suicide. The Trevor \nProject primarily uses social media to promote their crisis intervention \nservice; a service which is invaluable. The organization tries to influence the \nspirit of vulnerable LGBTQ*s positively and demonstrates that teenagers \ncan always reach out for support from the Trevor Project. An even broader \ninitiative to counteract consequences of direct and structural violence \nagainst the youth is the It Gets Better movement. It was started by a \nYouTube video of columnist and author Dan Savage and his partner Terry \nMiller whose intention it was to inspire hope for young people facing \nharassment, bullying and violence.147 The major difference compared to the \nTrevor Project is that It Gets Better only acts via social media with the \nintent to foster the knowledge that even though life might be tough as a \nLGBTQ* youngster, it eventually will get better. In contrast to the Trevor \nProject there is usually no direct contact on a personal level with the \nendangered teenagers. It Gets Better perceives itself as an organization that \ndistributes videos, tweets and Facebook posts with the intention of \npersuading teenaged LGBTQ*s that their future life offers many \npossibilities and that they will succeed in overcoming any hardship and \nchallenges just like millions of LGBTQ* people before. Their \npredominating strategy is the circulation of celebrities’ messages stating that \nthey have made it and that the addressees will be able to cope with all \ngrievances and drawbacks. It Gets Better does not exclusively focus on the \nUnited States but rather sees its mission to improve the life of young \nLGBTQ*s as a global undertaking. Nevertheless, the origin of the project \nwas in Los Angeles, CA in 2010. Over the last couple of years, celebrities’ \nstatements have become the most appreciated form of promoting the cause \nof the organization.  \nJason Collins was actually one of the icons that decided to \nparticipate in the joint project of the It Gets Better Project and L/Studio \n                                                 \n147 It Get’s Better Project, “What is the It Get’s Better Project”, accessed July 26, 2016, \nhttp://www.itgetsbetter.org/pages/about-it-gets-better-project/. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    94 \n \nwhich pictured celebrities’ struggles to come out and the ensuing \nimprovement of their lives in short video clips: The so-called It Got Better \nvideo series. In 2014, Jason Collins became part of the It Got Better series \nand told the younger generation his story always intending to give hope and \ncreate a positive prospective. The It Got Better Project delineates the \nimportant steps during the lives of the protagonists. It accentuates the \nmilestones the person has achieved over the years that have ultimately \ncontributed to the process of improvement. For Jason Collins, who has \nalways been reluctant to accept his identity and come out, a clip of the \ncomedian Keith Anthony in which he contributed to the It Gets Better \ncampaign, was finally the catalyst that triggered Collins’ coming out. \nDuring the shooting of the short clip, Collins describes the process he had to \ngo through to become a self-confident sportsman who is out and proud. The \nfootball player acknowledges: “Being gay is just another part of my \npersonality that I’m being proud of. And it took me a long time to get to that \npoint in my life.”148 Collins’ intention is to ease the burden many lesbian \nand gay teenagers have to bear by providing them with a positive example. \nEven though direct and structural violence are still imminent, there have \nbeen advances for the LGBTQ* community and there is more acceptance \nfor lesbian and gays which always correlates with meeting someone who \nsupports you. Providing youngsters with this knowledge can help prevent \ndesperation, depression, self-hatred, self-destruction and even suicides. \nSocial media has increased the avenues to name the problems within society \nand in the same instance to provide support for all those affected by unequal \ntreatment and violence. The availability of so many different tools to reach \npeople via social media facilitates the enlargement of the number of \ndifferent stories that can be shared. Jason Collins had to struggle with his \ngay identity as a black male athlete; the actress and model Portia De Rossi \nwho is married to the comedian Ellen DeGeneres shared her story revolving \naround her true identity that she had to keep closeted for decades. The result \nwas an eating disorder that De Rossi relates directly to the psychological \npressure she had to endure because of her need to keep her sexual \n                                                 \n148 “It Got Better Featuring Jason Collins,” YouTube video, 07:37.

The actor George Takei’s story is also tied to his fear of \ndestroying his career if he came out and was additionally complicated by the \nresentment he had to face as a Japanese-American citizen. Every single \nindividual who contributed to the project had a story to tell that was affected \nby personal challenges and the fear of how families, friends and society \nwould perceive oneself after coming out. Emotional tension, pretense, the \ncompulsion to hide and the fear and experience of rejection and even \nharassment and violence are always crucial parts of the videos. \nNevertheless, every single one of the participants pictures the relief after \ncoming out, the process one has to undergo to acknowledge one’s own \nidentity, the comfort they start to feel for themselves after a while and the \nhealing of the wounds received over all those years. The defining attribute \nthat is definitely necessary to start this process is “fortitude” stimulated by \nhope; and It Gets Better tries to provide the essentials to believe in one’s \nown inner strength. It also integrates a diversity of individuals into a \ncollective that is supportive of each other and focuses on saving the lives of \nthe younger generation. It incorporates the stories of common homosexual \npeople, thereby making It Gets Better an inclusive project. Suicides of \nLGBTQ* people are the point of intersection between structural and direct \nviolence. Direct violence can not only be furthered by cultural violence but \nalso by the experience of structural violence. Self-inflicted injuries and \nsuicides are acts of direct violence someone performs against oneself. Their \norigin lies in deep-rooted self-hatred that was stimulated by external forces. \nHeteronormativity, constant encounters of unequal structures, degradations \nand bullying are major factors that contribute to these developments. It Gets \nBetter seeks to create a community that stabilizes young LGBTQ*s who are \nstruggling. The project also tries to get them involved.  \nJamey Rodemeyer was among those who participated in the project. \nIn May 2011, the fourteen year old boy uploaded a video message as part of \nthe It Gets Better project. In this video, Jamey covers his coming-out story \nand emphasizes that it actually does get better. He describes the bullying he \nconstantly faced in school and online but also the support he received after \ncoming-out to his friends and from people he did not even know before, \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    96 \n \nwhich probably refers to the LGTBQ* online community.149 He repeatedly \nclaims that he reached the point that eventually has brought progress and \neased his situation as a young gay teenager who has been facing \nhomophobic slurs and bullying for years, who was told that he will burn in \nhell and that he should commit suicide. However, the repetition of his \nstatement “It gets better” always sounds more like a credo, an inner hope, a \npretension that might become true if he says it often enough. Only a month \nbefore Jamey Rodemeyer posted the It Gets Better video, he had uploaded a \nclip to his YouTube channel in which he talks about the anti-gay bullying he \nhad been facing in school. Responding to the task of answering a \nclassmate’s question more than half of the respondents replied to Jamey’s \nquestion if same-sex marriage should be legal in all 50 states with a negative \nresponse. The explanations ranged from “It goes against the bible” to “I \nthink it’s disgusting, wrong and against the bible.” Jamey states in the video \nclip that he considers the latter one “rude and hurtful” and that responses \nlike these are the reason why many LGBTQ*s feel “unwanted, not loved \nand not good enough”. He even points out that “things like this is [sic] why \npeople kill themselves”.150 Jamey’s situation did not get better within the \nmonth that lay between this video and his It Gets Better message; it also did \nnot get better the following months until the release of his second It Gets \nBetter video. In September 2011, Jamey uploaded another video to his \nTumblr page, a blogging website, and it was also added to YouTube by a \ndifferent user nine days later. In his second message, that was only 39 \nseconds long, Jamey re-emphasizes that it gets better. However, this time it \nis more than obvious that Jamey does not really believe in what he is saying. \nHe even admits that he is currently in a very difficult state saying “For me it \nis shitty as hell”151 and shows his arms that reveal cuts from self-inflicted \ninjuries. His voice is shaking and he seems to be close to tears. Still, he \nrepeats the It Gets Better credo right after showing his arms and it becomes \n                                                 \n149 “It Gets Better, I promise!,” YouTube video, 02:04.

You were born this way.” Right before \nJamey ends the video you can still hear him say: “No point in the video but \n...” Five days after he had uploaded this video, Jamey took his own life. In \nthe aftermath, it appears as if his last clip was already foreshadowing his \nsuicide. The constant derogatory comments, the hate Jamey had to face \nbrought him down. The It Gets Better project could not safe him but his \ndeath shifted the focus on violence against LGBTQ* kids nationwide. The \nnight before his death, Jamey posted a message equivalent to a suicide note \nto the Twitter page of the vocalist Lady Gaga. In almost all of the videos he \nposted, Jamey was referring to Lady Gaga as an inspiration and a source of \nstrength. Her song “Born this way” which Rodemeyer often cited \naccentuates self-worth and the beauty of diversity: \n \nThere’s nothing wrong with loving who you are \nShe [mother] said, ‘cause he made you perfect, babe \nSo hold your head up girl and you’ll go far, \nListen to me when I say \nI’m beautiful in my way \n‘Cause God makes no mistakes \nI’m on the right track, baby I was born this way \n \nDon’t hide yourself in regret \nJust love yourself and you’re set \nI’m on the right track, baby \nI was born this way152  \n \n \nJamey Rodemeyer embraced Lady Gaga’s lyrics and the virtues she \npromoted. In his first It Gets Better video, Jamey mentions “Lady Gaga – \n                                                 \n152 “Lady Gaga - Born This Way,” YouTube video, 07:19.

It goes back to Lady Gaga’s \npromise to protect minorities and everybody disadvantaged in society. Lady \nGaga soon learned of Jamey Rodemeyer’s suicide and responded to it \nimmediately on Twitter. With an empathy she has shown the LGBTQ* \ncommunity before she spread the news of Rodemeyer’s suicide. She \ncombined her sadness with political activism and called for actions but did \nnot hesitate to show her pain, frustration and anger that preceded her \ntweets.154155 \n \n \n \n                                                 \n153 Misguided Jamey, Twitter post, September 17, 2011, 10:27 p.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/hausofjamey/status/115295838594535424.  \n154 Lady Gaga, Twitter post, September 21, 2011, 03:03 p.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/116633801706323969?lang=de.  \n155 Lady Gaga, Twitter post, September 21, 2011, 03:00 p.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/116632826979422208. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    99 \n \nHer posts set off another chain reaction. Twitter users responded to her \nposts, retweeted them, tweeted messages themselves and created the hashtag \n#MakeALawForJamey thereby calling for a federal anti-bullying legislation. \nThe respondents were diverse and they all expressed their sadness, anger \nand desperation that it is still so common that adolescents – especially \nLGBTQ* adolescents – commit suicide because of intense experiences of \nbullying.  \n \n \n \n \nSocial media and Twitter in particular provides every user with an \ninstrument to create visibility and point to injustice to utter believes and \nconcerns. Both tweets above show the attempt not only to create visibility \nbut also to position oneself politically. The Twitter user Dean @Rebelcetti \ncalls for an end of hate156 while Toni A already clearly distinguishes \nbetween herself and “them” by saying “Yet they say homophobic remarks \nare ‘just words’”.157 Both users speak their mind and try to provoke \nreactions – similar to Lady Gaga who uses her soft power to reach million of \npeople. She even strengthened that effect when she dedicated the song \n“Hair” to Jamey at her concert in Las Vegas on September 25, 2011 – only \nsix days after Jamey’s death. She said: “I wrote this record about how your \nidentity is really all you’ve got when you’re in school – so tonight, Jamey, I \nknow you’re up there looking at us, and you’re not a victim.”158 In a very \n                                                 \n156 Dean, Twitter post, September 21, 2011, 03:39 p.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/Rebelcetti/status/116642791022526465.  \n157 Toni A, Twitter post, September 21, 2011, 04:13 p.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/Toni_hime/status/116651230264172544.  \n158 “Lady Gaga - Hair (A Jamey Rodemeyer Tribute),” YouTube video, 08:19.

The \nLGBTQ* community was shaken by the suicide of the teenager. The suicide \nvisualizes the mortal force which the combination of cultural, structural and \ndirect violence can unleash. The choice of the expression “victim” in Lady \nGaga’s statement is striking as this is exactly what the LGBTQ* community \nhas been fighting against for decades. The community pivots on the \naspiration to end the victimization and instead aspire to the acquisition of \npower. It is what connects LGBTQ*s nation- and worldwide. Lady Gaga’s \nperformance and her embracement of Jamey’s tragic life and death were \nultimately the steps that were necessary to transform the story of \nvictimization into a story of empowerment. Jamey Rodemeyer’s death \nshifted the focus on LGBTQ* suicides and stirred attention and a \nnationwide debate. His parents attended a TV show a week after the suicide, \ntelling the TV host about the anti-LGBTQ* bullying that even continued \nafter Jamey’s death when the bullies chanted “You are better off dead – we \nare glad you are dead” at a school dance during home-coming week which \nJamey Rodemeyer’s sister attended.160 Lady Gaga’s reaction to the suicide \nmade it an incident of public interest. In the aftermath, a lot of It Gets Better \nmessages on YouTube were dedicated to Jamey Rodemeyer. Lady Gaga’s \neffort was also acknowledged by the LGBTQ* community. On December 4, \n2011 the vocalist received the Trevor Project Hero Award. In her \nacceptance speech, she aligned the community to fight against anti-\nLGBTQ* bullying. Jamey Rodemeyer’s death brought the community \ncloser together; it also depicted that more has to be done to support young \nLGBTQ* kids who are full of self-hatred and/or despair.  \nA year before Jamey Rodemeyer’s death, another suicide related to \nanti-LGBTQ* bullying had made the news since the entertainer Ellen \nDeGeneres spoke out about it on public television. In September 2010, 18-\n                                                 \n159 In 2012, Lady Gaga and her mother, Cynthia Germanotta have founded the Born This \nWay Foundation, dedicated to “connecting young people in safe ways and empowering \nthem with the skills and opportunities that will inspire them to create a kinder and braver \nworld”. (https://bornthisway.foundation/about-the-foundation/) The ultimate goal is to fight \nbullying and the hateful climate children have to face. \n160 “Parents Of Jamey Rodemeyer Say After Suicide, He's Still Being Bullied,” YouTube \nvideo, 09:45.

She asks for direct action against the climate of hate and the \nrising numbers of LGBTQ* teenage suicides. The entertainer also tried to \nappeal to the teenagers’ sense of a community: “I want anyone out there \nwho feels different and alone to know that I know how you feel. There is \nhelp out there. You can find support in your community. [...] Things will get \neasier, people’s minds will change, and you should be alive to see it.”161 \nNevertheless, the number of suicides related to anti-LGBTQ* bullying that \nactually come to public attention is low. Initiatives like the ones that intend \nto codify bullying as a hate crime do not receive widespread support and \ntherefore bills do not get passed. In addition, both cases – the one of Tyler \nClementi and Jamey Rodemeyer – demonstrate that social media also poses \na threat since bullying reaches a completely different level. It is no longer \nrestricted to a specific space or time. It even affects LGBTQ* youths in \nalleged “safe spaces”, namely their homes. Its vehemence is increasing \ndramatically. Still, social media must be also seen as a tool that has the \npotential to delineate injustices, unequal treatment and violence. It fulfills \nthe role of bringing the community closer to the individual. The process of \nidentifying oneself with the community and its collective identity is ensuing \nfaster and the scars LGBTQ* people have received from structural and \ndirect violence might tighten that knot. Nonetheless, the challenge of anti-\nLGBTQ* bullying is enormous and the community has to adapt a more \nefficient strategy to pursue the implementation of anti-bullying legislation \nthat might additionally save teenagers from committing suicide. It must \nstress the importance of legislations against anti-LGBTQ* bullying. It has to \nrefer more persistently to the detrimental effects these actions have on \nadolescents. An instrument to pursue this task could be the violence triangle. \nActivists’ voices must be heard. \n                                                 \n161 “An Important Message - From Ellen DeGeneres (Gay Suicide),” YouTube video, \n01:45.

The median age of LGB*s when they first realize they might not \nbe heterosexual is 12 years.162 41 percent of LGBTQ*s had first told a \nfriend or family member about their sexual orientation or gender identity \nbefore they reached the age of 19 years.163  \nWhile it is already often challenging to come-out to liberal and open-\nminded parents, it must be even more difficult for a child to discern one’s \nown sexuality and simultaneously be sure that one’s parents will never \naccept that part of one’s identity. It seems to be so challenging that a \nconsiderable number of LGBTQ* youths end up on the streets. A survey \nconducted in 2012 shows that LGBTQ* teenagers are disproportionally \nrepresented among homeless youths in the United States. Estimates say that \n“between 240,000 and 400,000 LGBTQ* youths go through at least one \nperiod of homelessness each year in the United States.164 LGBT youths \ncomprise approximately 40 percent of the clientele served by agencies \ndedicated to the support of homeless people that participated in the study.165 \nThe estimated percentage of self-identified LGBTQ*s among the U.S. \nsociety has been consistently around three to four percent over the last \ncouple of years.166 Consequently, 40 percent of LGBTs among the total \n                                                 \n162 “A Survey of LGBT Americans Attitudes, Experiences and Values in Changing Times,” \nPew Research Center, June 13, 2013, accessed, February 2, 2017, \nhttp://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/06/13/a-survey-of-lgbt-americans/. \n163 Ibid.  \n164 Geoffrey L.

Gates, Serving Our Youth: Findings from a National Survey of \nService Providers Working with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth who are \nHomeless or At Risk of Becoming Homeless (Los Angeles: The Williams Institute with \nTrue Colors Fund and The Palette Fund, 2012), 2. \n166 “Americans Greatly Overestimate Percent Gay, Lesbian in U.S.,” Gallup, accessed \nFebruary 2, 2017, http://www.gallup.com/poll/183383/americans-greatly-overestimate-\npercent-gay-lesbian.aspx.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    103 \n \nyouths affected by homelessness is a dramatic overrepresentation. The 40 \npercent include teenagers categorized as officially homeless but also those \nnon-homeless LGBT teenagers who are living in shelters. Teenagers who \nare considered non-homeless LGBTs are those that would be destined to \nshare the fate of living on the streets if they did not have the opportunity to \nprofit from a housing program. The number of non-homeless LGBTs is \nrecorded by organizations that offer so-called housing programs including \npermanent housing and projects that try to prevent homelessness by \nintervening before a teenager runs away or gets kicked out. The Williams \nSurvey showed that the predominating reasons for homelessness of LGBT \nyouths are that teenagers ran away because of their family’s rejection of \ntheir sexual orientation or gender identity (46 percent) or were forced to \nmove out by their parents because of their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity (43 percent). Additionally, physical, emotional or sexual abuse at \nhome often stirred the adolescents’ decisions to leave their homes \nvoluntarily.167  \nA variety of organizations intend to counter homelessness among \nLGBTQ*s with a diversity of measures. The strategies range from drop-in \ncenters to mobile outreach programs as well as emergency housing and \ntransitional living. In the case of the Ali Forney Center, a New York based \norganization, drop-in centers predominantly offer medical checkups \nincluding psychiatric evaluation, HIV counseling and testing and medicaid \nenrollment as well as warm meals, hot showers and clean clothing. \nFurthermore, many organizations offer counseling and therapy groups, \nworkshops and recreational activities. The mobile outreach programs \nusually provide homeless LGBTQ*s with safer-sex and hygiene supplies, \nunderwear and socks, food and water, but also with information about \nshelters, drop-in centers and HIV/STI prevention. These programs try to \nease the burden of homelessness and to make life on the streets easier.  \nEmergency housing and transitional living, instead, focus on \neliminating homelessness altogether. The Ali Forney Center (AFC) provides \nemergency housing sites with a total of 47 beds. The program lasts from one \n                                                 \n167 Durso and Gates, Serving Our Youths, 4. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    104 \n \nto six months and aims at integrating LGBTQ* youths into transitional \nliving. However, the waiting list for emergency housing often record the \nnames of up to 200 young LGBTQ*s and some might have to wait for \nmonths until finally being able to move into a facility of the AFC. The \nultimate goal of the organization is to integrate LGBTQ*s into transitional \nhousing, a two-year program that helps young LGBTQ*s to lay the \nfoundation for a successful future. Teenagers in transitional living can stay \nat a shared apartment while finishing school and starting a vocational life. \nPrograms like these are crucial in assisting homeless LGBTQ* youths. \nThere are a range of organizations in multiple cities in the United States that \nhave perceived the need for LGBTQ* specific programs. The reasons for \nthis development are diverse. It has become apparent that LGBTQ* \nteenagers do not only suffer from a disproportionally high probability of \ndrifting into homelessness but also from harassment and an increased risk of \nbecoming victims of violence on the streets. Years ago, reports indicated \nthat LGBT homeless youths are up to seven times more likely than their \nheterosexual peers to become victims of a crime.168 Additionally, shelters \nhad proven to be unsafe spaces for LGBTQ* youths and accounts of \nLGBTQ*s illustrating that they had been “threatened, belittled and abused \nby staff and other youths because of their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity”169 indicated that organizations and facilities serving the specific \nneeds of homeless LGBTQ*s are essentially required.  \nIn the 2000s, not only the Ali Forney Center dedicated itself to the \nmission of providing assistance to homeless LGBTQ* youths. Many \nmetropolitan areas offer facilities for LGBTQ* youths that came into \nexistence in the late 2000s and early 2010s. In 2008, the Wanda Alston \nFoundation became the only housing program in Washington D.C. solely \ndedicated to offering transitional living and support services to homeless or \nat-risk LGBTQ youths. In Los Angeles, the LA LGBT Center has extended \nits service to homeless youths. However, the most critical factor in securing \nan expansion of services and an increase of the availability of facilities \n                                                 \n168 Nicholas Ray, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth: An Epidemic \nof Homelessness, (New York: National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy \nInstitute and the National Coalition for the Homeless, 2006), 3. \n169 Ibid., 5. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    105 \n \nremains the funding of organizations. In addition, it would be necessary to \nprevent young LGBTQ*s from becoming homeless at all. An attempt to \naccomplish this aspiration was the introduction of the Reconnecting Youth \nto Prevent Homelessness Act in 2011 by the U.S. Senator of Massachusetts \nJohn Kerry. The bill also targeted the high rate of homeless LGBTQ* \nyouths and was supposed to give the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices authority to “establish a demonstration project to develop programs \nthat are focused on improving family relationships and reducing \nhomelessness for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth.”170 \nHowever, the bill was not passed in Congress and information about further \nactions is rare. It appears as if legislation against youth homelessness does \nnot stand a chance at being introduced or passed. Therefore, it is plausible to \nconclude that pressure on the legislative body to implement respective laws \nis low. This is also underpinned by the poor degree of social media activism \nagainst homelessness by major gay rights organizations. The Human Rights \nCampaign exclusively offers a singular page on its website dedicated to \nhomeless LGBTQ* youths. The information provided has not been updated \nfor several years. A Twitter search for the expression “homeless LGBTQ*” \nresulted in a list of nine tweets posted by the Human Rights Campaign \nduring the period from 2010 to 2017. The last tweet was added on April 15, \n2015. The results for GLAAD were likewise modest. GLAAD posted only \napproximately 30 tweets addressing homeless LGBTQ*s. Most of these \ntweets were uploaded in 2014 and since then activism has remained low. A \nYouTube search also quickly indicates that homeless LGBTQ*s are not a \nkey topic of major gay rights organizations. While the Human Rights \nCampaign has not uploaded a single video covering LGBTQ* homelessness \nsince it started using YouTube, GLAAD has only provided one clip on its \nchannel. On December 1, 2014, the organization uploaded the video “All \nAccess: Taking in homeless LGBT youth for a living” in which GLAAD \nbroadcasted an interview with Rick Westbrook, Executive Director of Lost-\nn-Found-Youth, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting homeless \n                                                 \n170 “S.961 - Reconnecting Youth to Prevent Homelessness Act of 2011”, 112th Congress \n(2011-2012), accessed February 3, 2017, https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-\ncongress/senate-bill/961.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    106 \n \nLGBTQ* youths up to the age of 25 years in Atlanta. Its primary goal is to \nassist adolescents to achieve permanent housing after a transitional phase. \nAs part of the video the organization and its key goals are introduced. \nHowever, this video clip remains the only one approaching the topic of \nhomeless LGBTQ* youths that GLAAD broadcasted via its channel. Instead, \nnews outlets or smaller organizations uploaded videos depicting the daily \nroutine of homeless LGBTQ*s, illustrating the reasons for their misery, and \nshowing how organizations like the Ali Forney Center try to ease the \nsituation for youngsters. In The Life Media was among those that created \nvideos about homeless LGBTQ*s and uploaded the clips to YouTube. In \n2011, the television newsmagazine, which existed between 1992 and 2012, \nadded two videos to its playlist. In The Life Media was dedicated to the \nproduction of videos portraying the life of LGBTQ*s or documenting topics \nof importance to the community.  \nOne of the video clips called “A Day in Our Shoes” depicts the life \nof a young homeless lesbian woman in New York City. The catalyst for \nshooting this video was the cutback of state funding for a $65 million \ncontribution to a rental assistance program in New York City called \nAdvantage. The program provided homeless families with the ability to rent \ntheir own apartments and supported them with a rental voucher for up to \ntwo years given that the homeless adults found a job. However, only 30 to \n40 percent of the income had to be spent on rents. The remaining costs were \nborn by the cities. The program facilitated the transition between people’s \nlives in shelters and self-sufficiency. The cutback of funding led to a \ndramatic financial aggravation of the situation of homeless people in New \nYork City.  \nIn The Life Media tried to raise awareness and provide an \nunderstanding of the situation of LGBTQ* teenagers living on the streets or \nin homeless shelters. The young lesbian woman Tiffany “Life” Cocco \nillustrates her daily routine on the streets and emphasizes the “need to be \nheard”. The clip contrasts the comfort that shelters provide with the risk that \ncomes along when youngsters are forced to stay on the streets at night. To \naccentuate this disparity, Tiffany Cocco provides insight into where she \nspent many nights: On benches all over the city, in parks, in abandoned \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    107 \n \nbuildings, irrespective of freezing temperatures. Cocco says that she had \nbeen homeless for seven years at the time the video was taken. She \ndelineates how difficult life on the streets is – especially if you identify as \nLGBTQ*. “When you’re gay and homeless and it’s obvious that you are a \npart of the LGBTQ* community, you get discriminated on – hard. […] In \nour homes we’re not free to be who we are – but the streets are a lot \nworse.”171 Cocco describes how she usually does not get a lot of sleep at \nnight because she is always checking her surroundings to make sure that she \nis safe. Instead, she tries to sleep during the day. Cutting funding for shelters \nhits organizations severely and Cocco feels that this is even intensified by \nthe reality that “nobody shows that they care.” The clip illustrates the protest \nagainst the cutback of funding and shifts the focus on the cruelty resulting \nfrom financial curtailments. The displaying of the protests against the \ncutback are intended to generate cohesion among the community; a \ncohesion that could trigger a movement. Nevertheless, it becomes obvious \nthat the currently active organizations are mainly local chapters involved in \ncounteracting homelessness. A reality that is startling, since LGBTQ* youth \nhomelessness is a major manifestation of structural violence. Carl Siciliano, \nExecutive Director of the Ali Forney Center, highlights in the clip that he \ndoes not think that “there is a more terrible example of homophobia in our \ntimes.”172 Even though agonies can and should not be compared with each \nother, LGBTQ* homelessness is among the most severe manifestations of \nstructural violence resulting from heteronormativity. LGBTQ* teenagers are \noften either so afraid of coming-out to their families that they decide to run \naway or are even forced out of their homes by their family because of their \nsexual orientation or gender identity. Furthermore, they are assaulted and \nharassed on the streets and in a variety of shelters. They are completely \ndependent on the work of some minor organizations that acknowledge the \ndesperate need for special facilities for LGBTQ* people. Nonetheless, \nhardly any initiatives to fight the detrimental situation of LGBTQ* youths \n                                                 \n171 “A Day in Our Shoes - Homeless LGBT Youth,” YouTube video, 05:45, Posted by In \nThe Life Media, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXv1-fHd6Ug.  \n172Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    108 \n \nare launched. On the contrary, the few organizations that exist have to \nstruggle constantly to keep their funding.  \nIn The Life Media additionally assessed the situation of LGBTQ* \nhomelessness in a seventeen minute clip in 2011.173 It starts with Sassafras \nLowrey who ran away from home at the age of seventeen and who later \npublished books on LGBTQ* homelessness. Ze174 highlights that \nhomelessness has never been embraced by the LGBTQ* community, \nbecause the topic is simply not as striking for many activists as same-sex \nmarriage. This correlates with the major tool to create a collective identity: \nThe benefit one could gain from one’s own commitment. While same-sex \nmarriage is an attractive goal, since it promises one the possibility to get \nmarried, homelessness does only affect a small, voiceless minority of the \ncommunity. Sassafras Lowrey criticizes that “LGBTQ* homelessness really \nhappens in every community yet this is something that so few people are \ntalking about.” The video further delineates the situation at homeless \nshelters like “The Crib”, a LGBTQ* program in Chicago, IL and shares the \nstories of LGBTQ*s that are dependent on assistance to overcome \nhomelessness. The producers illuminate the challenges the young people \nhad to face and the chances that come with shelters and transitional living. \nThey portray initiatives started by organizations to provide homeless \nLGBTQ*s with a place to stay until they finish their education. The clear \nintention is to support homeless LGBTQ* teenagers in creating a social \nnetwork that also functions as a safety net and in constituting preconditions \nthat will ultimately serve as a point of origin for a successful life. The focus \nof the clip is on the contributions that organizations can provide for \nhomeless LGBTQ* youths. The video accentuates the essential need for \nsupport systems that create the basis for LGBTQ*s’ fresh starts. It is an \nimportant contribution to raising awareness but the outreach of the clip \nremained moderate (105,526 clicks; date: June 3, 2017). \nThe Los Angeles LGBT Center chose a different strategy to shift the \nfocus on homeless LGBTQ teenagers. In October 2013, the organization \n                                                 \n173 “Kicked Out: LGBT Youth Experience Homelessness,” YouTube video, 16:55. Posted \nby In The Life Media, October 27, 2011, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUhqodigPFk.  \n174 Sassafras prefers non-traditional pronouns to emphasize hir gender-fluidity.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    109 \n \nuploaded a video depicting the story of a fictional young gay man who is \nforced out by his parents after they found out about his homosexuality.175 \nThe protagonist embodies a gay homeless teenager who undergoes a \nstereotypical process. After he was kicked out of his home, he faces \nbullying and assault on the streets due to his homosexuality. Without a place \nto go, he finally engages in survival sex; sex in exchange for money that he \ndesperately needs for survival on the streets. A survey conducted in 2011 \nindicates that homeless LGBTQ*s between the ages of 10 and 25 years are \n70 percent more likely than homeless heterosexual youths to engage in \nsurvival sex.176 Survival sex does not exclusively mean that homosexual \nhomeless teenagers engage in sex in exchange for money. Many homeless \nteenagers also look for one-night stands, so that they can spend the night at \ntheir sex partner’s place. Nowadays, social media apps make it easier to get \nin contact with people and engage in survival sex.  \nFurthermore, “LGBT homeless youths are more likely than their \nheterosexual counterparts to trade sex with a stranger, have more than 10 \nsexual partners who are strangers, have sex with a stranger who uses \nintravenous drugs, have anal sex with a stranger, have unprotected sex with \na stranger, and have sex with a stranger after using drugs.”177 In addition, \nstudies suggest that runaway LGBTQ* youths have 3.3 times the risk of an \nHIV infection compared to nonrunaways.178 Moreover, LGBTQ* youths are \nat a higher risk of physical and sexual victimization which is also depicted \nin the video clip, when the protagonist gets raped. The young man in the \nclip ultimately starts to consume drugs and obviously struggles with mental \nproblems in an intensity that brings him to the edge of suicide. This \ndevelopment reflects a variety of studies that show the increased risk of \ndrug consumption, depressions and suicidal behavior of homeless LGBTQ* \nyouths.179 The intention of the video is to illuminate the challenges that \n                                                 \n175 “Parents abandon him for being gay; what happens next is too common,” YouTube \nvideo, 06:30.

Additionally, it also \nshows the support network that has developed over the years. At the end of \nthe clip, a range of celebrities appear on the screen providing the viewer \nwith facts on homeless LGBTQ* youths. Among them are the musician \nElton John, the actors Jamie Foxx and James Woods and the CNN reporter \nLisa Ling. The Los Angeles LGBT Center tried to use the soft power of \ncelebrities to raise awareness for homelessness. The video clip has been \nwatched 1,333,605 times (date: June 3, 2017) since it was uploaded on \nOctober 17, 2013. The discussion in the commentary section of the video \nhas not ceased over the years. Among those comments were messages \nwhich condemned the behavior of the parents who forced their child out of \ntheir home for being gay. The user AnimeLionessMika commented: “if you \nhate your child all of sudden for being gay, then you have never loved them \nat all. you only hold them as a trophy of your fake-perfect life, and this is \nobviously not what parenting is about.”180 [sic] The user Jesse T responded \nto this post by saying181: \n \n \nThis post exposes, again, the heteronormativity that still dominates society. \nThe video’s protagonist is perceived as a disappointment to his parents due \nto his homosexuality. The “parents’ expectations” are framed as a natural \nbelief that their child would be heterosexual and would eventually marry a \nwoman and procreate. A deviation from the norm is perceived by people \nlike Jesse T as a justification to reject one’s child. This narrow concept \ncompletely neglects the fact that gays and lesbians are able to reproduce and \n                                                 \n180 “Parents abandon him for being gay; what happens next is too common.” \n181 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    111 \n \nexclusively focuses on a stereotypical view of how people are supposed to \nlive their lives. It is the rule of heteronormativity and individuality that is \nreflected in Jesse T’s comment. He perceives something as personal that \ndoes not influence his life. He perceives someone’s homosexuality as \nthreatening to his way of life, his heteronormative concept. Because of this, \nhe is even willing to justify the misery of thousands of LGBTQ* youths and \nthe consequences that homeless people have to bear. The same attitude is \nreflected in Darth Septimus’ post182: \n \nThe YouTube user argues in a stereotypical way that not only exposes his \nheteronormative beliefs, but also his sexism and ignorance. “Being gay is \njust a phase” is often the response to a teenager’s or young person’s coming-\nout. This phrase embodies the conviction that the heteronormative system \ncan not be frail and resembles the assurance of the utterer’s own believes \nthat his/her social concept is legitimate. Moreover, the comment clearly \nshows how predominantly gay men are seen as a threat to one’s \nheteronormative world view. Lesbians, instead, receive the role of “girls” \nthat satisfy the sexual fantasies of males like the user Darth Septimus. The \nsentence “I have nothing against lesbians; I like girls” depicts the sexism \nand the patriarchal system that dominates their world. It reduces lesbians to \nobjects by the implication that the user “likes” the imagination of two \n“girls” in bed. The expression “girls” is a symbol of the patriarchal view. \nDarth Septimus denies lesbians their raison d’être as two independent \nhuman beings that love and desire each other free from any male’s fantasies.  \nThus, what reactions do videos like the one of the Los Angles LGBT \nCenter stir? They stir the revulsion of people who do not support the \nheteronormative system; they illuminate the potential of the masses that can \nbe unified in a movement. However, they also elicit the advocates of the \n                                                 \n182 “Parents abandon him for being gay; what happens next is too common.” \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    112 \n \nheteronormative system that oppose any different concept and that sustain \nthe concept that causes mental and physical pain on LGBTQ* people. The \ncomment section below the video exposes that most discussions surround \nthe topics of heteronormativity, although the expression is hardly used. \nPeople discuss the foundation of all this hate and homophobia and therefore \ncontribute to the creation of a social system that is all-inclusive and less \nprejudiced. While the topic of same-sex marriage stirred a powerful and \nbroad movement, homeless LGBTQ* teenagers do not have an influential or \nefficient pressure group. The major gay rights organizations hardly engage \nin raising awareness or in the coordination of activism. Even though the \npower of social media activism has already been proven, homeless \nLGBTQ* youths are neglected and not included in the discourse of major \norganizations. Discussions like the one in reaction to the video of the Los \nAngeles LGBT Center are hardly started, because organizations like the \nHuman Rights Campaign and GLAAD do not engage in activism. Moreover, \nthe refusal of the major organizations to spread a movement against \nhomelessness implicates that the chance of implementing legislation \nchallenging homelessness among young people remains low. This was also \nillustrated by the failure of the Reconnecting Youth to Prevent Homelessness \nAct in 2011 and also by cutbacks in funding of shelter programs in different \nU.S. states. Instead, organizations committed to easing the situation for \nhomeless LGBTQ*s have to find ways to raise awareness themselves. \nHowever, most of these organizations lack funding and manpower and are \nunable to foster efficient lobbying campaigns that additionally target the \nimplementation of legislation. The activism against LGBTQ* homelessness \nis dependent on individuals and minor organizations and therefore lacks \ntremendous resources that could be catalyzed into creating an influential \nmovement supported by the LGBTQ* community. The few video clips that \nwere uploaded received a decent amount of views. “A Day in Our Shoes” \nwas watched 261,263 times (date: June 3, 2017) while the statistics for \n“Kicked Out” show 105,525 views (date: June 3, 2017). However, In The \nLife Media was a TV newsmagazine, and not a political pressure group that \ncould unify the support of the community and transform it into activism. \nThe Los Angeles LGBT Center is a local chapter and only engages in \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    113 \n \npolitical activism in California. Homeless LGBTQ* youths need \norganizations that work on a federal level, reach millions of people, and \nhave the ability to influence the general society as well as politicians.  \nThe role of major crusaders is currently filled by a few celebrities \nthat regularly shift the focus on LGBTQ* homelessness. In November 2016, \nthe vocalists Madonna and Lady Gaga visited the Ali Forney Center in New \nYork. On Thanksgiving, Madonna spent some time with the homeless \nyouths and tweeted about her day at the Center. A day later, on Black \nFriday, Lady Gaga met LGBTQ* teenagers at the Ali Forney Center and \nperformed her song “Million Reasons”. Both vocalists tweeted about their \nvisits at the Center and informed the public about their mission. Lady Gaga \nwas also accompanied by a team of the TV Show Today for its \n#ShareKindness campaign which aired on television on December 5, \n2016.183 The video shows Lady Gaga engaged in conversations with young \nLGBTQ*s and how she opened up about her own post-traumatic stress \ndisorder she had developed after being raped at the age of 19. She thereby \nstarted a dialogue about mental illnesses which many of the homeless \nLGBTQ* teenagers face due to their experience of being neglected by their \nown family, ostracized and assaulted on the streets.  \nMiley Cyrus is also among those celebrities who try to shift the \nfocus on homeless LGBTQ*s. In September 2014, the musician founded the \nHappy Hippie Foundation, an organization committed “to rally young \npeople to fight injustice facing homeless youths, LGBTQ youths and other \nvulnerable populations.”184 The main focus is on homeless LGBTQ* \nteenagers and the organization offers support services, education and \nemployment opportunities. It also cooperates with a variety of local \norganizations. However, the activism is predominantly restricted to active \nsupport of homeless youths and less so on political activism. The Happy \nHippie Foundation has a YouTube channel as well as a Facebook and \nTwitter account. The YouTube channel almost exclusively lists music clips \n                                                 \n183 “Lady Gaga talks about rape and PTSD, encourages young people to ShareKindness,” \nYouTube video, 05:28.

Even though she performs the songs as part of the \nfoundation’s channel, hardly any viewers discuss the work of the \nfoundation. The channel’s page features two videos directly linked to Miley \nCyrus’ foundation and her activism: The first one is the clip introducing the \nHappy Hippie Foundation in the U.S. TV show The Voice in which Cyrus \nhad been fulfilling the role of a jury member.185 The second clip that was \nuploaded is her acceptance speech given after receiving the Power of \nWomen Award of the magazine Variety. The vocalist also took the chance \nand introduced her foundation in her speech.186 These two videos – apart \nfrom the music clips – were those most often watched. Still, the views of \nboth videos combined remained below 310,000 clicks. Those clips that were \ndedicated to educating the public and informing about the foundation’s \nwork only received between 81 and 879 views (date: June 3, 2017).187 The \nHappy Hippies Foundation’s Facebook and Twitter accounts are mere \ninstruments of redistribution of tweets and posts added to social media \nplatforms by other organizations. From tweets of the Human Rights \nCampaign regarding the impact of Trump’s immigration ban on LGBTQ* \nrefugees over reports to Hurricane Matthew’s devastating effects on Haiti \nup to tweets on the Pulse shooting – the foundation’s twitter page lists \nmessages on a diversity of issues. Although most of these issues are \ninterrelated and must be addressed to ultimately deconstruct \nheteronormativity, the Foundation does not fulfill the role of an organization \nthat contributes new approaches to the discourse. Their manifesto states: \n“We will challenge each other and the world & will stop pointless \njudgment.”188 [emphasis in original] However, to challenge world views and \nsocial norms requires more pointed and creative measures than re-tweeting \nsocial media posts of other organizations.

The Foundation does have the \npotential to add an important share to this task, since they could profit from \nMiley Cyrus’ soft power, but to this day they have not been able to trigger \nsignificant social media activism.  \nThe implications resulting from the insufficient activism are severe. \nNot only mental and physical impacts result from homelessness. A study \npublished in 2014 suggests that 39.3 percent of homeless LGBTQ*s do not \nfinish high school – even though the Education of Homeless Children and \nYouth Program that was established by the McKinney-Vento Homeless \nAssistance Act in 1986 improved funding and the availability of public \nschools to homeless children. Administered by the U.S. Department of \nEducation, it is supposed to provide every homeless adolescent with an \neducation that qualifies them for vocational life. Nonetheless, as indicated in \nthe chapter on bullying, LGBTQ* youths face a higher degree of bullying, \nsexual harassment and/or physical abuse at school compared to their \nheterosexual counterparts.189 This can result in negative academic and \nemotional implications, including non-attendance of classes, poor academic \nperformances which ultimately result in lower grades and worse life \nchances.190 The study additionally indicated that “LGBT homeless youths \nare at heightened risk for psychosocial problems as well as experience levels \nof verbal and physical school harassment comparable to non-homeless \nLGBT youths.”191 Passivity and the prevalence of a lack of efficient \nlegislations threaten the well-being of thousands of LGBTQ* youths that \ndrift into homelessness. This behavior has even more far-reaching \nimplications: A disproportionally high number of homeless LGBTQ* \nyouths drop out of school and weaken their chances to escape a life of \nhardship, poverty and jeopardy. \nIt is alarming that those LGBTQ*s who are suffering tremendously \nfrom the impacts of a heteronormative society are also those who experience \n                                                 \n189 Markus P. Bidell, “Is There an Emotional Cost of Completing High School? Ecological \nFactors and Psychological Distress Among LGBT Homeless Youth,” Journal of \nHomosexuality, 61 (2014): 369.  \n190 Ibid. \n191 Ibid., 372.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    116 \n \na substantial amount of neglect by their own community. The pressure \ngroup of homeless LGBTQ* youths is inefficient and social media activism \nis vanishingly low. Homeless youths do get neglected in the face of \nmainstream topics like the implementation of same-sex marriage. While the \nlatter basically affects the life of each individual lesbian and gay community \nmember, homelessness affects a minority of the LGBTQ* community. The \npersonal gain is not clearly visible for many potential activists and the bond \nwith the homeless youths is hardly perceived. The fact that it could have \nbeen oneself, if the circumstances were different, is ignored as well as the \ninterconnectedness with all the other major topics that entail activism. The \nmovement does not embrace the potential that an active struggle against \nLGBTQ* homelessness could have on the deconstruction of \nheteronormativity. One could even say that major parts of the LGBTQ* \ncommunity are guilty of complicity in respect to the mental and physical \nconsequences that homelessness entails for LGBTQ* people.  \nThe reluctance of major gay rights organizations in raising \nawareness and their decision to leave it to local chapters to face the \nchallenges that homelessness implicates is dangerous. The neglect of \nhomeless LGBTQ* people ostracizes them from the community. Homeless \nLGBTQ* are remaining voiceless and often desperate.    \n \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    117 \n \n1.7 LGBTQ*s in the Workplace: Inequality and \nNeglect \n \nIt is not surprising that the topic of same-sex marriage received so \nmuch attention in comparison to – for example – homelessness. Its \nrelevance for the whole community has been the unifying factor that created \na movement. Each individual LGBTQ* might potentially be affected by the \ndiscriminatory essence of any laws or regulations that denied same-sex \ncouples the right to marry. After the reversal of sodomy laws, it quickly \nbecame the central topic of the movement – also, because of the prevalence \nof the Defense of Marriage Act which the LGBTQ* community intended to \ndestruct by applying strategic litigation. However, another manifestation of \ninequality that, at first sight, one would characterize as an issue affecting all \nLGBTQ*s was embedded within the workplace.  \nSince 1973, the LGBTQ* community fights for the implementation \nof a federal bill protecting LGBTQ*s from workplace discrimination. To \nthis day, though, no federal bill was passed in Congress and successfully \nturned into law. The protection LGBTQ* people have is restricted to several \nstate laws and, on a federal level, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nTitle VII defines it as unlawful to discriminate on the basis of sex. In 1998, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court decided to follow a broader interpretation of the \nterm “sex” in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc. in which a male \nheterosexual oil-rig worker filed a complaint against his employer for \ntolerating and endorsing constant sexual harassment. In his delivery of the \nopinion of the court, Justice Scalia stated that: “[W]e conclude that sex \ndiscrimination consisting of same-sex sexual harassment is actionable under \nTitle VII.”192 Even though this decision granted LGBTQ* people a legal \nbasis that has the potential to serve as a precedent, workplace discrimination \nstill remains a major threat to LGB employees. The last two decades have \n                                                 \n192 U.S. Supreme Court, “Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,” No. 96—568. \nargued December 8, 1997, decided March 4, 1998. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    118 \n \nshown that not all circuit courts recognize a broad interpretation of sex \nstereotypes.193  \nTherefore, the LGBTQ* community actively pursued several \nattempts to implement a piece of legislation that specifically protects \nLGBTQ* people, among the latest were the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act (ENDA) and the Equality Act. The primary intention of \nENDA, which was last introduced into Congress in 2013, was to “address \nthe history and persistent, widespread pattern of discrimination on the basis \nof sexual orientation and gender identity by private sector employers and \nlocal, State, and Federal Government employers.”194 While the Senate \npassed the bill, the House of Representatives never voted on it, since House \nSpeaker John Boehner and many Republicans opposed the potential \nlegislation and did not initiate a vote in the House.  \nThe second legislative attempt, the Equality Act was introduced in \n2015 and was meant to prohibit discrimination or segregation in places of – \namong others – public accommodation, the education system, federally \nfunded programs and also in the workplace. It was supposed to amend the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 to include sex, sexual orientation, and gender \nidentity among the prohibited categories of discrimination.195  \nThese initiatives are the result of major discrimination against \nLGBTQ* people on the job. The 2008 General Social Survey (GSS), \nconducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of \nChicago, showed that 42 percent of the nationally representative sample of \nLGB-identified people were subject to at least one form of employment \ndiscrimination because of their sexual orientation at some point in their \nlives. 35 percent of those who were out at their workplaces reported that \nthey had been harassed during their career and 16 percent were even laid off \ndue to their sexual orientation. One third (33 percent) of LGB employees \n                                                 \n193 Yeongsik Kim, “Using Collective Bargaining to Combat LGBT Discrimination in the \nprivate-sector workplace,” Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender & Society Vol. 30, 1 (2015): \n81.  \n194 “S.815 - Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2013, 113th Congress (2013-2014),” \nU.S. Congress, accessed February 11, 2017, https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-\ncongress/senate-bill/815/text.  \n195 “H.R.3185 - Equality Act, 114th Congress (2015-2016),” U.S. Congress, accessed \nFebruary 11, 2017, https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3185/text.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    119 \n \nwere not open about being LGB at their workplace.196 Several studies \nindicate that discrimination and the fear of discrimination force LGBTQ* \npeople into hiding their identities from co-workers. As a consequence of \napprehension of getting outed at work, LGBTQ* people are hesitant of \ntaking employment opportunities at companies that might not pursue \nLGBTQ*-friendly policies. Furthermore, several studies indicated that \nhomosexual men earn ten to 32 percent less than their heterosexual \ncounterparts.197 However, studies on pay gaps also lack from shortcomings \nand have to be scrutinized. A recent study published in 2016 delineates the \ninaccuracy of these research findings. The major criticism by the sociologist \nTrenton D. Mize is that there has never been a distinction between bisexual \nand homosexual men. He therefore concludes that the findings were most \nlikely falsified. While Mize would explain the wage gap between \nhomosexual and heterosexual men as manifestations of a “preferential \ntreatment of married men and fathers”198, he instead detects a higher wage \ngap for bisexual men and women. Still he also emphasizes that these \nfindings are not integrating any further intersectional categories like race, \nethnicity or class.199 Thus, there is an urgent need for more comprehensive \nstudies that disclose the full extent of potential wage gaps between \nheterosexual and homosexual employees.  \nWhile the implications of one’s homosexuality on the salary are still \nnot completely uncovered, it has been affirmed by a variety of researches \nthat discrimination of LGB people in the workplace contributes to minority \nstress.200 Apart from the effects on homosexual’s mental wellbeing \ndiscussed in the previous chapters, studies have also demonstrated that \nminority stress directly influences one’s physical health outcomes, such as \nimmune function, AIDS progression, and perceived physical health.201 It \n                                                 \n196 Jennifer C.

Not only sociologists \nbut also researchers of law have dedicated their works to the study of \nworkplace discrimination that analyze cases of strategic litigation, the \nlawmaking process and strategies of collective bargaining. The issue of \nemployment discrimination and the potential effect that it might have on \naffected LGBTQ* employees also establishes the subject as one of the most \npolitical ones within the realm of political lobbyism.  \nThe Human Rights Campaign has been engaged in advancing \ndiscrimination protection on the grassroot level for years. On its website, the \norganization provides information about sample employment non-\ndiscrimination policies, the Equality Act and required steps for the \nadvancement of equality legislation. In 2009, the Human Rights Campaign \nalso published its Degrees of Equality Report that illuminated the \nprevalence of an anti-LGBTQ* climate in the workplace.202 The report \nincludes statistics surrounding experienced discrimination, one’s coming-\nout at work, the degree of inclusion and interactions with colleagues as well \nas the impacts that one’s sexual orientation might have on social relations in \nthe workplace environment. In addition, the Degrees of Equality Report \noffers assessment questions to employers that facilitate the evaluation of a \ncompany’s inclusiveness and LGBTQ*-friendliness. It further provides \nadvice for managers about how to improve the workplace climate and how \nto create awareness for LGBTQ* topics that eventually will prevent \ndiscrimination from spreading or even erase it completely.  \nThe Foundation also pushed for the implementation of essential \nlegislations by using social media, publishing informational sheets and \ncalling their followers to engage in direct actions like influencing their \nSenators. The Equality Act was among those topics that were boosted by the \n                                                 \n202 The Human Rights Campaign Foundation, Degrees of Equality: A National Study \nExamining Workplace Climate for LGBT Employees, Washington, D.C: The Human Rights \nCampaign, 2009.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    121 \n \norganization; the Human Rights Campaign even introduced the hashtag \n#equalityforward. However, the discourse circulating around these \ninitiatives has always remained limited. The tweets received hundreds of re-\ntweets as well as “likes”, but discussions in the commentary section have \nnever developed prolifically. Most Twitter users exclusively posted their \nconsent to the endorsement of laws and protections but a decision to engage \ninto organized activism was not perceptible – also because the HRC did not \nprovide any guidance.  \nThe Human Rights Campaign additionally relied on YouTube videos \nto promote their cause. In 2015, two clips explaining the essence of the \nEquality Act were supposed to educate viewers and to impose pressure on \npoliticians to implement the act. The clip “HRC Leads Call in Fight for \nFederal Equality for LGBT Americans on Capitol Hill” summarized the \nopinions of important supporters, among them political leaders of the \nDemocratic as well as Republican parties. Furthermore, Luke Peterson, a \ngay man who was fired three times for being gay, and Carter Brown, a \ntransgender Texan man who experienced workplace harassment, testified in \nthe video. The testimonies were followed by a statement of the President of \nthe Human Rights Campaign Chad Griffin who highlighted: “In most states \nin this country still today, a couple who gets married at 10 a.m. is still at risk \nof being fired from their jobs by noon and evicted from their home by 2 \n[p.m.]. All on the same day. Simply for posting that wedding photo on \nFacebook. This is fundamentally wrong and it needs to change.”203 Griffin \ndirectly refers to the success of gaining marriage equality, but also to the \nfact that there are still manifold shapes of inequality that make a LGBTQ*’s \nlife burdensome. Sean Patrick Malony, U.S. Representative for the State of \nNew York, ended the video by appealing to the conscience of \nRepresentatives and Senators. He stressed the prospect that, ultimately, \ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity will be \nbanished by a federal legislation and that it is only a question of time: \n \n                                                 \n203 “HRC Leads Call in Fight for Federal Equality for LGBT Americans on Capitol Hill,” \nYouTube video, 04:53.

Were you standing \nin the doorway or were you opening the door? And to those who still \noppose us, we ask you to look into your hearts and to look into the \nfuture. Because history will judge very harshly your decision in the \nnext few weeks about your position on this bill. There is still time to \ndo the right thing – join us and let’s move forward together.204 \n \nMalony’s statement simultaneously subtly refers to the last time history has \njudged politicians very harshly, after denying their support for civil rights: \nThe time, when the civil rights movement brought the end of segregation, \nthe time, when the Civil Rights Act was implemented into law – the last \nmajor federal piece of legislation that bans discrimination on the basis of the \ncharacteristics of race, color, religion, sex or national origin.  \nNevertheless, the number of YouTube videos posted by the major \ngay rights organizations is lower than expected. GLAAD, for example, \nhardly focused on employment discrimination. In 2013, the organization \nuploaded a clip fostering the implementation of the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act.205 The video is composed of a conference call in which \nLGBTQ* activists participated and that intended to analyze the reasons, \nwhy the Employment Non-Discrimination Act has not been passed to that \ndate and why it is so essential to implement it in the future. Even though the \ntopic is crucial and should be a major one within the movement, GLAAD did \nnot endeavor to create an appealing clip. The audio quality is poor and the \nvideo takes more than 30 minutes. The probability that someone might \nwatch the clip to the end is low. This is neither the way to convince people \nto join a movement nor to educate them, since hardly anybody will watch 30 \nminutes of that low-quality video clip.  \nAlmost the same applies to the YouTube presence of the Human \nRights Campaign. The video clip that was discussed above is the best \nattempt of reaching the LGBTQ* community and medial awareness. But \nbesides that, videos that focus on employment discrimination have been \n                                                 \n204  “HRC Leads Call in Fight for Federal Equality for LGBT Americans on Capitol Hill.” \n205 “The time is now: Pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,” YouTube video, \n31:35.

This has become one \nof the central pieces of the Foundation’s focus, apart from political \nlobbyism.  \nIn 2013, the HRC’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities \n(HBCU) Leadership and Career Summit addressed LGBTQ* adolescents \nand provided them with information regarding their job entrance as \nLGBTQ*s and behavioral strategies after entering the workforce.206 A year \nlater, in 2014, the Human Rights Campaign distributed a clip, together with \nthe U.S. Small Business Administration, that provides advices on how to \nmake a small business LGBTQ*-inclusive.207 Deena Fidas, Director of the \nWorkplace Equality Program, briefs a number of small business owners on \n– among other points – non-discrimination, equitable benefits for LGBTQ* \npeople and transgender health care coverage. However, the clip that takes \nalmost an hour is the recording of a conference call that is also of poor \nquality. Each of the two YouTube videos has been watched less than 3,000 \ntimes (date: June 3, 2017). Still, what both of these videos illuminate is that \nthe Human Rights Campaign is seeking an active cooperation with business \nowners and LGBTQ* employees and tries to ease the challenges that \nLGBTQ* people face on a grassroot level.  \nHowever, what has been shown by the efficient movement for same-\nsex marriage is that celebrities and personal stories by people who face \ninequality on a daily basis is the key to creating a collective identity, raising \nawareness and influencing politicians. So why has this strategy never been \nadapted by major gay rights organizations? The few Twitter posts that \nGLAAD as well as the Human Rights Campaign have circulated indicate \nthat they actively favor an employment non-discrimination act and \nsupported the Equality Act. Why do these organizations not promote the \nrealization of their goals with more precise social media activities? The \npressure could certainly be intensified and the political process accelerated. \n                                                 \n206 “Generation Equality: Entering the Workforce, a Twitter Town Hall,” YouTube video, \n1:05:54.

The primary \nmotive was the users’ ambition to pressure President Obama into issuing an \nExecutive Order that was supposed to protect LGBTQ* employees. \nAlthough the Employment Non-Discrimination Act was introduced into \nCongress the same year, it was almost certain that it would not pass the \nHouse of Representatives, in which the Republicans had the majority. \nTherefore, individual Twitter users engaged in the endorsement of an \nExecutive Order that was ultimately issued by President Obama in 2014. \nAdditionally, 200 Democratic Congress members issued a letter to President \nObama in March 2014, urging him to sign an Executive Order and fulfill his \npromise of a “year of action”.208  \nUltimately, President Obama signed Executive Order 13672 on July \n21, 2014 and thereby amended Executive Order 11478 from 1969 (Equal \nEmployment Opportunity in the Federal Government) and Executive Order \n11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity) from 1965. Executive Order 11478 \nwas accordingly adjusted, so that, after Barack Obama’s Executive Order \nwas issued, it also guaranteed non-discrimination in federal employment \nunder the categories of sexual orientation and gender identity. Executive \nOrder 11346 prohibited “federal contractors and federally–assisted \nconstruction contractors and subcontractors, who do over $10,000 in \nGovernment business in one year from discriminating in employment \ndecisions on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender \nidentity or national origin.”209 The categories of sexual orientation and \ngender identity were appended by President Obama’s Executive Order. The \nExecutive Order issued in 2014 assured equal treatment in the federal \nworkspace and for federal contractors for the years it was in effect. But the \nmost profitable companies, to which federal contractors belong \npredominantly, have anti-discrimination policies anyway – at least on paper. \n                                                 \n208 “Pallone Calls for Executive Order to Protect LGBT Workers from Workplace \nDiscrimination,” pallone.house.gov, accessed February 24, 2017, \nhttp://pallone.house.gov/press-release/pallone-calls-executive-order-protect-lgbt-workers-\nworkplace-discrimination.  \n209 Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), “Executive Order 11246 — \nEqual Employment Opportunity,” United States Department of Labor, accessed February \n23, 2017, https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/regs/compliance/ca_11246.htm.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    125 \n \nIn 2010, 87 percent of the 500 largest publicly-traded companies, which \ncollectively employ nearly 25 million people,210 had anti-discrimination \npolicies that included sexual orientation, 46 percent of them also covered \ngender identity or expression. LGBTQ*s can therefore revert to policies \nimplemented by their employers, given that they are enforced by the \ncompany’s officials. A breach of internal policies can be persecuted \ninternally while chances to succeed with a lawsuit on a legal level in the \njudicial system are low.211 Moreover, the number of companies covering \ngender identity should be increased and policies efficiently enforced.  \n \n \nNonetheless, the most persistent employment discrimination of \nLGBTQ* people can probably be found in small businesses in rural areas. \nThese employees are those most in need of the community’s support. These \nare the people that would profit from an active campaign by major gay \nrights organizations and from the implementation of anti-discrimination \nlaws. However, these LGBTQ*s are destined to remain voiceless and are \nnot integrated into the pursuance of political action. Comments on Twitter \nare rare and, as mentioned before, neither GLAAD’s nor the Human Rights \nCampaign’s approach affected LGBTQ*s positively and they also did not \nhelp them to make their voices heard. There are certainly reservations and \ndoubts LGBTQ* people would have if they were asked to speak out; the risk \n                                                 \n210 “LGBTQ Equality at the Fortune 500,” Human Rights Campaign, accessed February 23, \n2017, http://www.hrc.org/resources/lgbt-equality-at-the-fortune-500.  \n211 If above mentioned Executive Orders get violated judicial consequences could be \nenforced. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    126 \n \nof coming out and being discriminated against is still high and, after \nexperiencing discrimination before, it is probably a frightening idea to \nendanger one’s integrity again. Nevertheless, there are LGBTQ*s who \nwould join the movement and contribute to the task of raising awareness \ndespite any potential negative consequences.  \nThe Center for American Progress, a progressive policy research \nand advocacy organization, in fact, applied the strategy of sharing \nLGBTQ*s’ stories in their YouTube video series on workplace \ndiscrimination against LGBTQ* people. In 2013, when ENDA was \nintroduced into Congress, the center uploaded eight clips delineating the \nunequal and discriminatory treatment of transgender people, gay men and \nlesbian and bisexual women. All of them were targets of harassment and \ndiscrimination, after colleagues or employers had found out about their \nsexual orientation or gender identity. The Center for American Progress \nhelped to share their stories and to raise some awareness.  \nAshland Johnson, a black lesbian woman, illuminated how she had \nbecome a victim of discrimination at a company in Atlanta that actually had \nan internal anti-discrimination policy. However, when her supervisor found \nout that she was in a relationship with a woman, Johnson was asked to \nresign which she denied. From that point on, Johnson had to face overt \ndiscrimination and was ultimately fired while she had to stay at the \nIntensive Care Unit for a week. The termination letter even amplified the \nstress that she had already felt due to the financial burdens that her hospital \nstay had entailed. In the beginning, Johnson was certain that she could sue \nher employer for the discrimination and harassment she had experienced: \n“Finding out there was nothing I could do just surprised me. I think a lot of \ntimes people look at internal policies and think that is enough, but it took \nthat experience for me to realize that policies don’t mean anything unless \nsomeone is willing to enforce them.”212 Johnson had to face overt \ndiscrimination that impacted her life and brought her in a threatening \nsituation when she was laid off while being hospitalized. Still the only steps \nshe could take were sharing her story and thereby emphasizing the need for \n                                                 \n212 “Workplace Discrimination Series: Ashland Johnson,” YouTube video, 02:29.

Call me names, make fun of it, say \nthey wish all faggots would die.213 \n \nHall’s complaints to his supervisor had never been persecuted and he \nultimately learned that he had no rights and that there was no judicial basis \nfor taking any legal actions against workplace discrimination based on his \nhomosexuality.214 He spent his time at the company in fear of becoming a \nvictim of direct violence and, at the same time, had already faced a \ntreatment that left mental scars. After he had decided to leave the mining \ncompany, Hall regained his strength and decided to fight for his rights and \nfor all those who are not able to do it for themselves: “[...] I just don’t want \npeople going through what I had to go through; because I know how painful \n                                                 \n213 “Workplace Discrimination Series: Sam Hall,” YouTube video, 05:12. Posted by \nseeprogress, July 16, 2013, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6VX_oZmJII.  \n214 Even though he eventually tried to sue his former employer which led to a confidential \nagreement in 2012. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    128 \n \nit is. I know what it is to sit in your truck and cry, going to work, coming \nhome. How miserable it is. You just want to lay down and say heck with it, I \ndon’t want no more of it. You just got to dig down deep and find it. And just \nkeep going.” Sam Hall’s story shows that LGBTQ* people are willing to \nspeak out and to share their stories; that it is important to let all those who \nstill suffer from harassment and violence know that they are not alone; that \nthere is a community backing them up. The Center for American Progress \nshowed that there are LGBTQ*s who are willing to talk about what they \nexperienced. The challenge is to spread the stories to an influential and large \npublic that is able to influence politicians. All these videos that were part of \nthe “Workplace Discrimination Series” hardly received more than 2,000 to \n3,000 views (date: June 3, 2017). An initiative by the Human Rights \nCampaign or GLAAD would have the potential to reach distinctly more \npeople and the distribution of a higher amount of videos could even \nmultiply this effect. \nThus the question prevails why major gay rights organizations do not \nembrace actions against employment discrimination more tightly. The \npresumption that a climate of ignorance and egotism penetrates this specific \nissue is sustainable. The mental and physical implications workplace \ndiscrimination can have on LGBTQ* people are not instantly obvious. If \nsomeone is not directly affected by workplace discrimination or the fear of \nbecoming subject to harassment, the matter is quickly erased from one’s \nmind. Furthermore, the assumption that not coming-out and hiding one’s \nsexual orientation is always a potential tool to prevent discrimination seems \nto be a valid solution for many people. At the same time, mental \nconsequences are being ignored.  \nThis is where the debate, or the lack of a debate, also results in self-\ninflicted structural violence; self-inflicted, because the major gay rights \norganizations do have the potential and the resources to initiate social media \nactivism that can unify the community and increase the pressure on political \nactors. It can give LGBTQ* people a feeling of belonging and ease the \nburden they experience. It is striking that the Human Rights Campaign and \nGLAAD – in cooperation with Freedom to Marry – have constructed an \nefficient movement for same-sex marriage and against inequality that \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    129 \n \ncharacterizes the U.S. society and that defines the perception of LGBTQ*s \nin the public sphere every single day. But when it comes to issues that do \nnot necessarily affect each individual LGBTQ*, the organizations stay \nreluctant. Bullying of LGBTQ* youths and resulting suicides are targeted by \norganizations that exclusively focus on these challenges and that sometimes \nface support by the Human Rights Campaign and GLAAD. Homeless \nLGBTQ* youths, however, face total neglect from the majority of the \ncommunity and especially from the most influential gay rights \norganizations. It is peculiar that primarily local organizations lead the \nstruggle against homelessness and it is also interesting that the Human \nRights Campaign and GLAAD seem to have the impression that traditional \ngrassroot activism and political lobbyism will be enough to advance \nequality in the workplace. However, the last years have shown that their \nactivism is not efficient enough to endorse federal bills that could ultimately \nprovide LGBTQ* people with a legal basis to fight workplace \ndiscrimination. Yet in relying on these tactics, they jeopardize LGBTQ*s \nmental and physical health. The social media movement has to spread its \nstrategy to use the whole variety of tactics targeting different emotions. \nThey have to create a strong grassroot that integrates the different ways to \nreach people. The diverse approaches discussed above show that celebrities \nand the common man are as valuable in pursuing equality since they all \nstimulate feelings that are appealing for potential activists: While the \ncommon man usually creates a bond of a shared fate, celebrities have the \npower to motivate people who are not experiencing violence on a daily \nbasis. At the same time homosexual celebrities can also create a feeling of \nunderstanding and belonging among LGBTQ*s. Fear, anger, despair as well \nas frustration, the shocking realization to be affect oneself or to be a \npotential target – all these emotions can be stimulated and utilized for the \nmovement’s cause. Even a single post or tweet can be valuable - irrespective \nof the ultimate amount of people reached. Sometimes a single post of \nsomeone affected by violence might lead to the desire of dozen of people to \nengage in activism. The value and relevance of the posts and tweets can not \nbe compared – and as mentioned before, this is also not the intention of this \nthesis. The diverse forms of social media activism complement each other. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    130 \n \nIt is the combination of different tactics that transforms the movement into \nan efficient body. And it is this strategy that has to be applied and extended \nto ensure successes for the social media movement. \n \n \n \n  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    131 \n \n2. Direct Violence \n2.1 Bringing Attention to Direct Violence \n \n“He wanted to make a difference. Did he? You tell me.” \n- Dennis Shepard, father of Matthew Shepard. Statement to the \nCourt on 11/4/99. \n \nViolence is diverse in its appearances and also in its effects. It might \nbe invisible to one’s glance and gradually spreading its impact. Or it might \nbe institutionalized and hard to discover. It might affect a group of people – \nor it might simply hit a single person with an immense and visible outcome \nthat one is hardly able to conceal from the general public. Direct violence, \naggression that is affecting gays and lesbians physically, has been a life-\nthreatening challenge for LGBTQ*s for decades. The first gay rights \nmovement was born out of a revolution against violence against LGBTQ*s. \nStonewall was the result of decades of massive intimidation, physical \ndegradation and enduring traumas that LGBTQ*s had to experience \nindividually as well as collectively. However, the Stonewall Riots were only \nthe beginning. Still, advancements during the first couple of decades after \nStonewall have been rare. Even nowadays, violence is still custom and \nexperienced on regular basis by individuals and therefore at the same time \nby the whole community. Any attack against an individual conducted \nbecause of one’s sexual or gender identity is an attack against the LGBTQ* \ncommunity. Any attack motivated by the sexual orientation or gender \nidentity of the target is a rejection of the community, of the life LGBTQ*s \nlead. Direct violence is hurtful – not only for the one who experiences the \nviolence personally but also for everybody else sharing the gender identity \nand/or sexual orientation. Direct violence will always leave scars and it will \nalways trigger a reaction. The Stonewall Riots were a sudden outburst of \nemotions originating from violence endured for years. At the same time, \nStonewall was supposed to be the trigger to fight for progress and it was \nsupposed to eventually initiate a healing process. Time has shown that the \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    132 \n \nfight for advancements is a tough one which needs resilience and absolute \ncommitment. Time has also shown that the healing process will have to \ncontinue for an indefinite period and that it will be characterized by the \nrecurrence of events that constitute a backlash. Scars will burst open and \nstart bleeding again. The murder of Matthew Shepard was such an incident. \nOn the night of October 6, 1998 the 21-year-old student was given a ride by \nAaron McKinney and Russell Henderson whom he had met at the Fireside \nLounge in Laramie, Wyoming, a bar well-known to be predominantly \nfrequented by gays. McKinney and Henderson drove to a rural area outside \nof Laramie, robbed Shepard, tortured and beat him, tied him to a fence and \nleft him to die in the freezing night. Matthew Shepard never regained \nconsciousness and died six days later in hospital. McKinney and Henderson \nwere charged with first degree murder, kidnapping, and aggravated robbery. \nMedia attention increased steadily and soon worldwide attention was paid to \nthe brutal killing of Matthew Shepard. At the same time, Shepard’s \nsexuality was spotlighted and the murder was soon perceived as a hate \ncrime. Over the course of the trial the hate crime allegations were never \nfully clarified – also because hate crime legislations were absent not only \nfrom the federal but also from the state laws at that time – but evidence \nsuggests that Matthew Shepard’s sexual identity had a dominant role in his \nmurderers’ motivation to kill the 21-year-old.215 The demeaning reactions of \nseveral religious groups right after the emergence of the facts and the \npresenting of the murderers even highlighted the role of Shepard’s \nhomosexuality. The funeral was accompanied by protests coordinated by \nreligious and conservative groups. Statements like “No Tears for Queers”216 \nand “Matt in Hell” were broadcasted all over the world and elicited \nreactions from gay rights activists. Matthew Shepard’s killing was an act \nthat hit the whole LGBTQ* community. And so did the anti-gay protests in \nthe aftermath. The murder of Matthew Shepard became a key moment for \n                                                 \n215 Over the last two decades, the media has contributed to the speculations that Shepard’s \nmurder had not been stipulated by homophobic feelings but by a disagreement between \ncrystal meth addicts - even though there has hardly been any evidence provided which \ncould underline this theory. According accusations have tried to demote Shepard’s role as a \nsymbol of the LGBTQ* community.  \n216 The ultra-conservative Westboro Baptist Church especially fostered slogans like “No \nTears for Queers” and “God Hates Fags” and gained attention for its blatant anti-LGBTQ* \nattitude and radicalism.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    133 \n \nthe gay rights movement. It illuminated that successes and improvements \nsince the 1960s were short-lived and that LGBTQ* lives were still under \nthreat. Furthermore, the circumstances in Wyoming showed that masses of \npeople even justified the torture and killing of homosexuals. Matthew \nShepard made a difference: He showed the world that LGBTQ* people are \nstill a target and that the struggle for LGBTQ* rights has to be led more \nintensely. This also implied that the gay rights movement has to reinvent \nitself constantly. One – and almost the only – reaction to the Matthew \nShepard murder on a legislative basis was the fight for hate crime \nlegislations all over the United States. One of the most important initiators \nwas Shepard’s mother, Judy Shepard, who led an intense lobbying \ncampaign in favor of hate crime legislations which eventually succeeded in \n2009 when Congress passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate \nCrimes Prevention Act. The act defines any offenses due to actual or \nperceived religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender \nidentity, or disability as hate crimes. The passage of the act was more than \njust symbolic; the act guarantees the ability of the federal law enforcement \nto prosecute hate crimes and it additionally grants financial resources to \nlocal and state authorities in order to investigate and prosecute respective \ncrimes more effectively. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) 18.7 percent of the 6,727 single-bias incidents were motivated by the \nvictim’s sexual orientation in 2014.217 The number of victims targeted due \nto their gender identity was reported as 109 people (1.6 percent). In 2015, \nthe FBI reported 1,263 hate crime victims (17.7 percent of total amount) \ntargeted due to sexual-orientation and 122 victims (1.7 percent) of gender-\nidentity bias.218 The report for the year 2016 has not been published so far.  \nThe FBI statistic is far from transparent and complete, and \nadditionally, the percentages of the 2014 report do not match the actual \nfigure of people mentioned in the report. Nevertheless, the reported hate \ncrime victims by the FBI slightly coincide with the number of 1,359 (2015: \n                                                 \n217 Federal Bureau of Investigation, “2014 Hate Crime Statistics,” Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, accessed August 29, 2016, https://ucr.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-\ncrime/2014/topic-pages/victims_final. \n218 Federal Bureau of Investigation, “FBI Releases 2015 Hate Crime Statistics,” Federal \nBureau of Investigation, accessed January 26, 2017, https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    134 \n \n1,253)219 incidents of hate violence from LGBTQ* and HIV-affected \nsurvivors220 reported by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs \nin 2014.221 Both figures apply to the incidents reported in the territory of the \nwhole United States. Nevertheless, the FBI reports hate crimes while the \nNCAVP refers to hate violence. This implies that the incidents listed by the \nNCAVP were not necessarily reported to the police and that their nature as \nhate crimes not legally determined. In contrast, the FBI only includes bias \nattacks for which “law enforcement investigation reveals sufficient evidence \nto lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the offender’s \nactions were motivated, in whole or in part, by his or her bias, should an \nagency report an incident as a hate crime.”222 Yet, the National Coalition of \nAnti-Violence Programs emphasizes that the number of hate violence \nreported by their organization as well as hate crimes by the FBI is probably \nway below the real figure and that the majority of hate violence often \nremains un-reported. The NCAVP, on the one hand, sees its own inability to \ncover more acts of hate violence as part of a decline in its outreach and \nstaffing as a result of a transition phase they had gone through. On the other \nhand, the reasons for the inability of the FBI to cover all hate crimes are \nmanifold. Statistics of the NCAVP indicate that only half of the survivors of \nhate violence who are part of the NCAVP survey report the incident to the \npolice due to negative experiences like hostility and excessive force with \nlaw enforcement.223 In 2015, the number of those who have reported the \nincident to the police has dropped from 54 percent in 2014 to 41 percent. In \naddition, even the Bureau of Justice Statistics, another federal agency, also \nestimates that the hate crimes reported to the FBI on a national basis are \n                                                 \n219 National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, Lesbian, Gay, Bissexual, Transgender, \nQueer, and HIV-Affected Hate Violence in 2015, (New York: Arcus Foundation, 2016), 14. \n220 This number includes all “survivors” that identify as LGBTQ* or are HIV-affected. \nTherefore, it can not be compared directly to the FBI statistic since the methodology as well \nas the composition of those identity categories integrated into the reports does not \ncorrespond.  \n221 National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, Lesbian, Gay, Bissexual, Transgender, \nQueer, and HIV-Affected Hate Violence in 2014, 8.  \n222 Federal Bureau of Investigation, “2015 Hate Crime Statistics – Methodology”, accessed \nJanuary 26, 2017, https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/resource-pages/methodology_final. \n223 National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, Lesbian, Gay, Bissexual, Transgender, \nQueer, and HIV-Affected Hate Violence in 2014, 11.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    135 \n \nabout 40 percent less than the ones really conducted.224 Another striking \nfactor contributing to the low numbers of reported hate crimes could be the \nambiguous definition of “hate crime” per se and the difficult differentiation \nbetween the mere intention to commit a hate crime and potential other \nfactors triggering the crime. The FBI even confirms that due to the fact that \n“motivation is subjective” it is difficult to determine which crimes constitute \na hate crime and therefore a criminal offence.225 Being robbed and beaten as \na gay man is often statistically considered a robbery and not treated as a hate \ncrime – even if some indications, like homophobic slurs, would suggest \notherwise. Furthermore, there seems to be a lack of adequately trained \npolice officers which results in an insufficient awareness of homophobic \nhate crimes and an inappropriate handling of the situation.226  \nAnother concept to be factored into the reporting and analyzing of \nhate crimes is the concept of intersectionality. If a black, lesbian woman is \nsubject to direct violence it would not be sufficient to consider the attack \nexclusively as a hate crime due to homophobia. Instead, it would be \nnecessary to evaluate the impact of the woman’s racial background to the \nact of violence. Inequality and violence rarely result from a single factor; in \ngeneral the culmination of different identity categories and power structures \nconstitute the foundation of violent acts. Therefore, violence against \nhomosexuals always has to be investigated in regard to the racial \nbackground of the victim as well. In addition, homophobic hate crimes \nusually do not exclusively stem from the victim’s sexual orientation but also \nfrom his or her gender performance. As Doug Meyer has indicated in his \nwork on intersectional analysis of anti-queer violence “lesbians and gay \nmen both experience violence for violating gender norms”.227 The concept \nof heteronormativity and the resulting homophobia is not the sole trigger for \nanti-lesbian violence; sexism as well as misogyny contributes to the \ndecision to use direct violence against a lesbian woman. So, how is it \n                                                 \n224 National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, Lesbian, Gay, Bissexual, Transgender, \nQueer, and HIV-Affected Hate Violence in 2014, 18. \n225 Federal Bureau of Investigation, “2015 Hate Crime Statistics – Methodology.” \n226 National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, Lesbian, Gay, Bissexual, Transgender, \nQueer, and HIV-Affected Hate Violence in 2014, 62. \n227 Meyer, “An Intersectional Analysis of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) \nPeople’s Evaluations of Anti-Queer Violence,” 851. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    136 \n \npossible to built a coherent LGBTQ* activism in spite of their differences \nand the diverse identity constructs that contribute to violence? How can one \nconstruct a functional movement that aims to fight structural as well as \ndirect violence? Is the struggle for the disbanding of the concept of \nheteronormativity far-reaching enough?  \nThere might be multiple approaches to integrate the diversity of the \ncommunity into a movement and pursue the multiplicity of goals. However, \ndissolving the concept of heteronormativity is still the logical starting point. \nHeteronormativity is the concept that links all homophobic violence – \nregardless of other factors. Not targeting society’s heteronormativity would \nresult in a total devastation of LGBTQ*s aspirations. The unification of the \nLGBTQ* community is realistic but always has to be adapted to the current \nsocial, political, economic and technological conditions. Social media \nbroadens the space of interaction, the possible outreach and the diversity in \nwhich objectives can be illuminated. Every single individual is able to share \nhis or her or someone else’s story. The coverage can be enormous if \nsomeone knows how to use social media efficiently. Gay rights \norganizations have developed efficient strategies targeting some \nmanifestations of unequal structures. Surprisingly, LGBTQ* organizations \nare hesitant to canalize more resources into the medial discourse of direct \nviolence.  \n \n2.2 “I Take Bullets”: Direct Violence and Social \nMedia Activism \n \nAfter Matthew Shepard’s murder hardly any acts of direct violence \nagainst LGB people have received much media attention for precisely a \ndecade. Shepard actually remains the most significant symbol of direct \nviolence against the LGBTQ* community to the present day.  \nHowever, another murder which attracted much public attention in \n2008 was the shooting of the fifteen year old Lawrence “Larry” King at \nE.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, California. Larry King had come \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    137 \n \nout as gay at the age of ten and never hid his sexual orientation afterwards. \nHe was subject to bullying since the day he came out and his gender non-\nconformity probably enhanced the intensity of the bullying he experienced. \nTeachers’ and classmates’ reports indicate that King started to wear \nwomen’s clothing, high heels and makeup shortly before he was murdered \nand thereby did not comply with the general public expectations of gender \nnorms. It appears as if Larry King and his murderer and classmate Brandon \nMcInerney were facing an ongoing conflict and that McInerney had intense \nfeelings of repugnance towards King. While McInerney bullied King on a \nregular basis, King seems to have started to provoke him with comments \nlike “Love you, baby” and valentine’s proposals at some point. On February \n11, 2008 Brandon McInerney pulled out a gun from his backpack and shot \nKing twice in the back of his head. Afterwards, McInerney dropped the gun \nin the computer lab where the two had a class and left the building. Larry \nKing was declared brain-dead on February 13, 2008 and was taken off life \nsupport shortly after that. Heteronormativity and gender norms have cost \nLarry King his life and have led to the imprisonment of Brandon McInerney \nwho was seventeen at the time of his conviction.  \nThe trial showed that convicting someone on the additional basis of \nthe hate crime legislation is not easily done – even though hate crime \nlegislations were in effect in California. The first trial was a mistrial due to \nthe failure of the jury to find a consensus if a manslaughter conviction or a \nfirst- or second-degree murder conviction should be reached. At the \nbeginning of the second trial the hate crime charges were dropped to avoid \nanother failure of the trial. Eventually, Brandon McInerney pleaded guilty to \nsecond-degree murder and his attorney bargained a sentence of 21 years \nimprisonment. The case has received coverage by several U.S. TV stations \nand newspapers. However, in the sphere of social media there was almost \nno coverage at all. The rise of social media was still at its inception and the \nLGBTQ* community had not been able to utilize the potential of social \nmedia platforms yet. It still took two more years until Lady Gaga promoted \nthe repeal of DADT via social media and illuminated the vast power that \nYouTube, Twitter and Facebook contain. Nevertheless, Larry King’s \nmurder did receive public attention due to Ellen DeGeneres’ decision to \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    138 \n \nmake a statement against violence only two weeks after the killing.228 The \ncomedian, who already created a lot of visibility by coming out as gay in \n1997, criticized the homophobic, heteronormative and aggressive social \nclimate in a very emotional speech: \n \nAnd, somewhere along the line the killer, Brandon, got the message \nthat it’s so threatening, so awful, and so horrific that Larry would want \nto be his Valentine that killing Larry seemed to be the right thing to \ndo. And when the message out there is so horrible that to be gay, you \ncan get killed for it, we need to change the message. Larry was not a \nsecond-class citizen. I am not a second-class citizen. It is ok if you’re \ngay.229 \n \nEllen DeGeneres’ approach has always been to deconstruct \nheteronormativity and demand equality instead. Even though her show is \nusually characterized by joyful and funny moments she regularly speaks out \nagainst violent acts with the intention to initiate change. Here she addresses \nthe sensitive issue of cultural violence – even though she does not use the \nactual expression: \n \nI would like you to start paying attention to how often being gay is a \npunchline of a monologue or how often gay jokes are in a movie. And \nthat kind of message, laughing at someone ‘cause they are gay, is just \nthe beginning. It starts with laughing at someone; then it’s verbal \nabuse, then it’s physical abuse, and then it’s this kid Brandon killing a \nkid like Larry. We must change our country.230 \n \nCultural violence and direct violence are closely interrelated. As long as it is \nacceptable to joke about homosexuals, as long as they are perceived as \nsecond-class citizens, citizens without equal rights, direct violence will be \n                                                 \n228 “Ellen DeGeneres on 15-year-old boy, Larry King, killed for being Gay,” YouTube \nvideo, 02:38.

Therefore, Ellen appeals to the \nconsciousness of her audience to consider wisely for whom they will vote in \nNovember 2008 when the U.S. presidential election was held. Ultimately, \nEllen’s statement was basically the only contribution to a social media \nrepresentation of Larry King’s murder. In the months of March and May \n2008, two different YouTube users uploaded the video and thereby made it \naccessible for viewers worldwide (clicks: 1,380,129; date: June 3, 2017). \nNevertheless, a real dialogue and debate was missing and progress did not \nevolve. Still, Ellen’s decision to speak out shifted the focus on direct \nviolence against homosexuals and created some visibility for a short period \nof time.  \nOver the next four years the representation of direct violence against \ngays and lesbians in social media was vanishingly low. The occasion that \nactually stimulated the highest degree of social media activity after the \nLarry King murder was the attack on a lesbian couple in Portland, Texas in \nJune 2012. Mollie Judith Olgin and Mary Kristene Chapa were robbed and \nsexually assaulted in Violet Andrews Park. Afterwards, the assailant shot \nboth execution-style which left Mollie Judith Olgin dead and her girlfriend \nMary Kristene Chapa severely injured. Chapa survived and has put great \neffort in regaining her physical and mental health since the assault. She is \nstill recovering even though her physical shape is steadily improving. In \n2014, David Strickland was arrested for the alleged assault on the lesbian \ncouple and the murder of Mollie Olgin and the attempted murder of \nKristene Chapa. The trial was delayed until September 2016 when he was \neventually sentenced to life in prison without parole. Right after the attack \nwas brought to public attention in 2012, Twitter users started to send tweets \nbased on this act of violence. The tweets were dominated by condolences \nand appeals for fundraisings to support the recovery of the surviving Mary \nKristine Chapa financially. In addition to the diverse tweets the Gay & \nLesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) started raising awareness \nand spreading the story of the violence the two young women had to face. In \n2015, Chapa shared her story at the 26th Annual GLAAD Media Awards in \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    140 \n \nNew York.231 The young woman, who was 18 years of age at the day of the \nattack, still showed signs of her severe head injury. Her left hand seemed to \nbe paralyzed and her voice indicated that she still has trouble talking. Both \nis not surprising since her left side had gotten paralyzed and Chapa had to \nre-learn walking as well as speaking. Nevertheless, Chapa contributed to \nGLAAD’s Southern Story Tour by telling her mother’s experiences right \nafter Kristene Chapa and her girlfriend were brutally attacked. Her mother \nwas restlessly waiting for her to come home all night, not knowing that her \ndaughter had been sexually assaulted and shot in the head, not knowing that \nKristene was with her girlfriend that evening since her daughter had not \ncome out to her yet. Finally, the next day at 4 p.m. a police officer was at \nher door, behaved quite uncomfortably and had a strange look on his face. \nHe eventually started by saying: “Your daughter was with a girl – she is \ngay”. Even though Kristene Chapa was struggling to survive in this \nparticular moment due to being victim of a cruel act of violence, the police \nofficer decided to start by telling her mother that Kristene was gay which \nled to Chapa’s mother’s response: “I don’t care that she’s gay. I just want to \nknow that she’s ok.” The fact that the police officer started the conversation \nby informing Grace Chapa about something negligible must be seen as a \nmanifestation of heteronormativity and homophobia rooted deeply in U.S. \nsociety. What else would trigger someone to start a conversation like this \nthe way the police officer did? There is no logical explanation.  \nThe alleged perpetrator was not charged with a hate crime and it \nremains uncertain what prompted him to choose the two young women as \nvictims. During the trial, Strickland denied that he had been the perpetrator \nand therefore neither Chapa nor the public received any information as to \nwhether the girls’ homosexuality was a decisive factor. Nevertheless, the \npossibility that the women’s homosexuality might have been a cause for the \nattack stirred the debate and demonstrated that homosexuality has to be \nconsidered a potential catalyst of direct violence. The Twitter user Jozette \nMorales (@143zettey) tried to stir some activism after Strickland was \n                                                 \n231 “Kristene Chapa shares her story at the #glaadawards,” YouTube video, 07:00.

She tries \nto stimulate a movement and to appeal to the collective identity of the \ncommunity when she uses the expression “rainbow family”. Nevertheless, \n                                                 \n232 Jozette Morales, Twitter post, November 15, 2014, 09:39 a.m. \nhttps://twitter.com/143zettey/status/533675679657623552.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    142 \n \nthis remained the only explicit attempt to unite the community in active \nsupport for Kristene Chapa on Twitter. Still, due to the re-tweeting of \narticles and condolences, the attack received the highest social media \ncoverage of an attack against gays or lesbians since the murder of Larry \nKing. Kristene Chapa’s decision to speak out about the difficulties of being \na lesbian in the Southern part of the United States contributed to raising \nawareness and maybe also to accelerating acceptance. However, neither \nLarry King nor Kristene Chapa’s and Marry Olgin’s agony have launched a \nmovement against direct violence LGBs have to face on a regular basis.  \nAnother atrocity that was only superficially dealt with was the brutal \nbeating of Aaron Keahey, a gay man from Texas in 2013. Keahey had been \nchatting with a man on an online dating site and eventually arranged a \npersonal meeting. In September 2013, he went to the apartment of his date \nand was immediately ambushed by the 18-year old. He was severely beaten \nand suffered skull and facial fractures and brain injury. The aggressor Brice \nJohnson assumed that he killed Keahey and therefore put him in the trunk of \nhis car, drove to a friend’s place where Keahey was able to rouse attention \nby screaming and alerting neighbors. Johnson was eventually pressured by \nhis friend and neighbors to transport the injured man to the hospital and was \narrested while Keahey went into surgery. In November 2015, Johnson was \nsentenced to 15 years in prison after he had pled guilty in exchange for the \ndrop of hate crime charges. Nevertheless, the act of violence was undeniably \na hate crime motivated by homophobia. Still, media coverage was low. \nDuring the first four months after the attack only two dozen tweets referring \nto the incident were registered on Twitter. All of them simply re-tweeted the \ncoverage of some local news stations. A man lured someone else into \nmeeting him with the intention to beat him up and even risk killing him – \nsimply for the fact that the victim was gay. Where was the outrage among \nthe LGBTQ* communities? Neither the communities nor the rest of the \nsociety responded to the attack compassionately. Why is it that the fate of \nindividuals is ignored while, at the same time, a very active movement \nagainst particular outgrowths of structural violence was already developed \nand promoted by the community? In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign and \nFreedom to Marry already used Twitter, Facebook and YouTube very \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    143 \n \nefficiently in their struggle for nationwide marriage equality. Direct \nviolence, however, was underrepresented and neglected. \nOne of the few moments in which direct violence received more \nattention and also stimulated a response of a major group of the LGBTQ* \ncommunity was the occurrence of multiple atrocities in New York City \nwithin several months only. The outrage against a series of direct violence \nagainst gays was initiated by the killing of the black gay man Mark Carson \non May 18, 2013. That particular night, Mark Carson and a friend were \napproached by a Latino man in New York’s Greenwich Village, the gay \ntown of the city. The Stonewall Inn, where the Gay Rights Movement got \nstarted, was only a few streets away. The offender Elliot Morales started to \nshout anti-gay slurs at the two men, clearly intending to provoke a reaction. \nIn a dark corner of the street he pulled out a gun and shot Mark Carson in \nthe face while Carson’s friend was still on the phone alerting the police and \nasking for help. Mark Carson died at the crime scene and the perpetrator \nwas arrested. The crime was considered a hate crime as soon as \ninvestigations were started and Elliot Morales was charged on this basis in \naddition to a second-degree murder charge. In June 2016, Morales was \nsentenced to 40 years to life in prison. During the trial he decided to defend \nhimself and argued that the murder was not motivated by him being \nhomophobic, as he once dated a transsexual woman and would consider \nhimself “trisexual, bisexual – multiple.”233 In addition to the fact that \nMorales is obviously not familiar with constructs of sexual orientation and \ngender identity and the appropriate terminology, his homophobic motive \nwas confirmed by his behavior prior to the crime and had been witnessed by \nseveral people in the Village. The reactions in social media right after the \ncrime were, for the first time, remarkable. Compared to the atrocities \nmentioned before, Twitter results with the hashtag #MarkCarson \nskyrocketed. The news about the crime spread quickly via social media and \nLGBTQ* activists started to organize vigils. Even though many tweets \nsimply re-tweeted the coverage of news stations, countless additional users \n                                                 \n233 Joe Williams, “Man found guilty of homophobic murder sentenced to 40 years in \nprison,” PinkNews, June 14, 2016, accessed September 3, 2016, \nhttp://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/06/14/man-found-guilty-of-homophobic-murder-\nsentenced-to-40-years-in-prison/.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    144 \n \nstarted to tweet political statements. The user Talia noted on May 18, 2013: \n“We’re going to stand. We’re not going to hide our love. We’re going to \nspread it.” The tweet was followed by the hashtags #truth #markcarson \n#solidarity.234  \n \n \nThis was one side of the responses uttered by the community and its \nsupporters: Resilience and pride, total commitment and oaths to cohesion \nand solidarity. It was this response that stimulated the vigils and marches \nthat were organized after the murder of Mark Carson. The other side that \ncontributed to that spirit of protesting was despair and frustration. LGBTQ* \npeople in the United States face direct violence almost each day. There is a \nconstant threat of becoming targeted. Nevertheless, the murder of Mark \n                                                 \n234 Talia Hilm, Twitter post, May 18, 2013, 09:37 p.m.,  \nhttps://twitter.com/HiImTalia/status/335977458119634945. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    145 \n \nCarson was the first incident since Matthew Shepard that stimulated such \nintense reactions. One of the major reasons for this development is reflected \nin Shea Richards’ Twitter post from May 21, 2013. The Twitter user posted \na photo of the crime scene and voiced “If you can’t be gay in the goddamn \nvillage, where can you? #MarkCarson”.235  \n \n \n  \nThe question is legitimate. The Village has always fulfilled the role of a \n“safe space” and a place where the LGBTQ* community could exist \nwithout being constantly judged by the heteronormative society. The murder \nof MarkCarson was a violent intrusion into this particular safe space and \ninflamed fear. The LGBTQ* community started to indicate publicly that \nthey were attacked – it was the first time after the killing of Matthew \nShepard that the murder of a gay man was brought to the attention of the \nmajority of society. The call for reforms became louder – education and \nraising awareness was shifted into focus. Vigils and marches were held and \nsocial media were used as a tool of distribution. The community moved \ncloser together and became pro-active.  \n                                                 \n235 Shea Richards, Twitter post, May 21, 2013, 12:39 a.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/shearichards/status/336929372218990592.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    146 \n \nPatrick J. Hamilton was one among many people who tweeted the \nphotograph of a sign stating “Marriage means nothing if we are gunned \ndown” which was used during a rally in memory of Mark Carson in New \nYork.236 The reasoning to express a statement like this is understandable. \nThe possibility to marry will only bear deeper meaning if you are able to \nprofit from it; getting killed will automatically thwart someone from this \nexperience. However, the right to marry – which was already in place in \nNew York in 2013 – represents an important step towards equality. It leads \nto a deconstruction of heteronormativity and weakens the foundation of \ncultural violence which always justifies structural as well as direct violence. \nStructural and direct violence have to be fought simultaneously with the \nidentical amount of vigor and commitment. The reality has always been that \nthe community puts much more effort in fighting unequal structures than \nfacing the threats of direct violence.  \nOnly two weeks prior to the killing of Mark Carson, two gay men, \nNick Porto and his partner Kevin Atkins, were attacked during daylight on \nthe streets of New York City. Both suffered facial injuries as well as injuries \ncovering the whole body. The vehemence and the impudence of the attack \nwere tremendous. The couple tried to alert the public, raise awareness and \nshow that direct violence against gays and lesbians remains to be an \nimmense challenge that will not disappear if it is not faced. However, the \ndegree of response was alarming as is also exposed by the post of a blogger \nspread via Twitter:  \n \nTalking with them I learned that they attempted to bring their story to \nany national media outlet, to get the conversation going about the need \nto protect our community, but no one seemed to be interested. Not \neven now, where a man has been murdered in cold blood on the streets \nof NYC just for being gay and walking on the street.237 \n \n                                                 \n236 Patrick J.

Not the community but a news outlet \nchose to bring the story to national attention. The video recorded more than \n247,508 views (date: June 3, 2017).238 The clip opens with the statement \n“An Attack on Equality” and illuminates the experiences the couple had \nfaced: For them it started with hearing anti-gay rhetoric, being shoved to the \nground and beaten in the face while both were still crouching on the ground. \nThey were passed by many pedestrians but no one intervened or called the \npolice. Nick Porto decided to share their story on Facebook. Even though he \nreceived many compassionate responses, he was shocked by several \nreactions which implicated that he should “man up” and “grow balls”.239 \nDisturbingly, these comments came from gay men – a reality that suggests \nthat resignation has already spread within the community and that it comes \nin different shades. This was also affirmed by several further messages of \ngay men responding to Nick Porto’s Facebook post240 of the gay bashing of \nanother man in New York City, Dan Contarino: \n \n                                                 \n238 “An Attack on Equality: Gay Couple Tells of Their Assault | Op-Docs | The New York \nTimes,” YouTube video, 05:45.

Jimmy Tunstall’s \ncomment “I never advocate violence. Never. Well I used to never … but I \nam just so sick and tired of this. And No one seems to take it seriously” \nreveals the desperation of many LGBTQ* people. This development is \nthreatening the cohesion of the movement and also its peaceful nature which \ncan only be hurtful to its course. It is essential to counteract this trend. \nResignation should not be fostered by the movement’s hesitance to embrace \nthose affected by direct violence. In the NY Times video, Nick Porto \nexpresses his feelings after having experienced the attack: “[It] is kind of \nincredible having to worry of somebody to beat us up – for holding hands.” \nPassing for straight men and hiding their own identity in the public has \nbecome a daily task since the offence. In contrast to the gays who have lost \nhope that the situation will eventually improve, the attack made Porto and \nhis partner realize that remaining silent will not alter the conditions and that \nfighting violence and inequality in all its manifestations is inevitable: “We \nhave marriage now, yay, yay, fight is over? No! Fight has never been over. \nIt has never been about that. We still are not being treated equal. That’s all \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    149 \n \nit’s coming down to: The fight is certainly not over.”241 As a consequence, \nPorto posted several comments on Facebook relating to his own experiences \nas well as to other felonies which took place in New York over the \nfollowing weeks. His desperation and craving for solidarity and support \nbecame more and more observable. On May 19, 2013, a day after the \nshooting of Mark Carson, Porto posted242: \n \n \n \n \nNick Porto tried to raise awareness, to create some kind of solidarity within \nthe community and to urge everybody to start fighting – the successes were \nmarginal.

On the Internet, the news about the sentence was difficult to find. \nHowever, Nick Porto shared the court decision as well as his thoughts and \nfeelings he had since the attack. On August 17, 2016 he delineated his well-\nbeing, his post-traumatic stress disorder and how he has relived the moment \nof the attack every single day since May 2013.243 In the subsequent \ndiscussion, during which several other gay men shared their stories of direct \nviolence, Porto sheds light on his psychological state in more detail:  \n \nAnd I’ve not been myself since. I am constantly triggered, in a \nperpetual state of fight or flight. I would lash out at work even. When \nI worked for Runway I was almost fired for talking back to some bitch \nwith a superiority complex. I was suicidal, and my direct superiors \nhad a laugh about it with my ex saying I should kill myself. \nSometimes I wish I had. I’ve lost myself in this process. I’ve spent \nyears trying to be me, and I don’t think I know who I am anymore.244  \n \nThe impact of direct violence is extreme and there are many victims willing \nto talk about their experiences, willing to support a strategic movement \nagainst direct violence which gays and lesbians have to face regularly. They \nrefuse to be victimized and instead see themselves as “survivors” who want \nto share their story and initiate change. The Facebook user Daniel J Cartier \ndecided to share his experience of direct violence as a response to Nick \nStryker’s post:  \n \nWhen I was 19 years old, six “men” beat me, and a guy I was on a \nfirst date with, to the point of blacking out. I had a rock smashed over \nmy head and I was dragged across the sidewalk while they took turns \nkicking me. They made me watch while they strangled my friend until \nhe passed out. I thought they’d killed him. I thought I was next. \nStaring death in the face... is just a concept until you’re actually \n                                                 \n243 Nick Stryker, Facebook post, August 17, 2016, 04:01 p.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/nick.j.stryker/posts/10100498398542679.  \n244 Nick Stryker, Facebook post, August 19, 2016, 15:58 p.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/nick.j.stryker/posts/10100498398542679. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    151 \n \nstaring it down for real. No fear I’ve felt since that night 27 years ago \ncan match the fear I felt at that moment. It exists in a world all it’s \nown. [sic] \n \nI don’t remember how I got away. One second I was being beaten, the \nnext second I was running down a crowded street with shocked \nonlookers gawking at me. My clothes were all torn, and I was \nscreaming. I ran up to some kids standing outside a movie theater and \ngrabbed one of the girls [sic] arms. “Where’s the police???” I \nscreamed. I took my hand off her arm and saw I’d left a bloody \nhandprint on her shirt. I had no idea where my friend was - but \nwherever he was - I thought he was dead. It wasn’t until hours later \nwhen he found me at the hospital that we realized we’d survived. We \ncouldn’t speak to one another. It was like there was this massive wall \nof shame that had been erected between us. Years later I bumped into \nhim in NYC and we exchanged awkward small talk. We didn’t \nmention the incident.245 \n \nAn act of violence against gays or lesbians is always an attempt to impose \nthe heterosexual matrix on those targeted. The exercise of violence due to \none’s sexuality often triggers an irrational feeling of shame; a feeling one \nhas to fight against for years. The experience of a collectivity and the \nadaption of a collective identity might help to overcome this phase. Daniel J \nCartier emphasizes that it was on the gay pride parade in Seattle – probably \nin 2004 – when he took the microphone and shared his story for the first \ntime: \n \nLadies and Gentlemen... Years ago, six men tried to beat the gayness \nout of me. Well, I want them all to know - wherever they are - that \nthey failed miserably. I’m still here. I’m still queer... and and [sic] I’m \nyelling it on a stage into a microphone! I’m not afraid to say loudly to \nall you fine people - and the entire park for that matter - that what \n                                                 \n245 Daniel J Cartier, Facebook post, August 18, 2016, 12:43 p.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/nick.j.stryker/posts/10100498398542679. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    152 \n \ndoesn’t kill us makes us fabulous... and honey... I am FUCKING \nEXTRA FABULOUS!246 \n \nStories like these and the discourse surrounding similar experiences stir the \nfeeling of a shared fate, a collective identity. It does not really matter if \nviolence was experienced the week before or years ago. The binding string \nis the experience of harm due to the same catalyst – homophobia and the \nenforced heteronormative concept. This shared fate contains the potential to \nresonate in activism. People like Nick Porto or Daniel J Cartier try to come \nto terms with their experiences by engaging in political actions. However, \ntoo often, they share Porto’s experience: Porto was left on his own – neither \nthe society nor – which is even more dramatic – major parts of the \ncommunity provided any guidance or support. This amplifies the impact \ndirect violence has on its victims; it makes them more prone to negative \nmental consequences. Nick Porto’s intention was to try to make a difference \nand to create a broader movement against direct violence – but all \nindividuals who have tried to initiate a broader movement are basically left \nall on their own. Shocking killings like the one of Larry King, Mollie Olgin \nor Mark Carson initiate a small momentum but they could not ignite an \nefficient and long lasting movement. Seven hate crimes in New York City \nwithin the month of May 2013 stirred the debate – but only for a short \nperiod of time. Despite the potential social media entails to organize \nmovements and reach out to people, the LGBTQ* movement remains \nreluctant.  \nAnother severe incident of direct violence that took place in New \nYork City over the next months was the beating of Dan Contarino which \nNick Porto mentioned in one of his Facebook posts. The 45-year-old was \nbrutally attacked by an acquaintance after the man learned that Contarino \nwas gay. This hate crime took place two days after the murder of Mark \n                                                 \n246 Daniel J Cartier, Facebook post, August 18, 2016, 12:43 p.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/nick.j.stryker/posts/10100498398542679. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    153 \n \nCarson. Contarino posted a photograph of his smashed face on Facebook \nand commented247:  \n \n \nThe response on Facebook was immense. Many users were shocked and \nshared the story on their Facebook page. However, a consensus that an act \nof defiance is necessary was missing and so was a reaction by a broad \nmovement to confront direct violence against lesbians and gays. This \nmatches Dan Contarino’s Facebook post: “U JUST WANNA CRY N \nMOVE ON…” Contarino shared his story because he felt the urge to do it in \nthis particular moment but ultimately he just wanted to forget what \nhappened. He obviously does not see a reasonable chance of success in \ndefeating direct violence against LGB people. Just like the community had \nnot reacted with a widespread movement after the beatings of Nick Porto or \nDan Contarino the same scenario became visible in the case of Josh \nWilliams, Tony Maenza and Ben Collins.  \nOn June 2, 2013 a gay man was arrested by police officers without \nsufficient elements of an offense. The police officer assumed that Josh \nWilliams, who was on his way home at 4 a.m. after spending the night out, \nwas urinating at the side of the stationhouse. Williams as well as his \n                                                 \n247 Dan Contarino, Facebook post, May 21, 2013, 01:04 a.m. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151479192758445&set=a.10150219917393\n445.325295.710738444&type=3&theater. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    154 \n \nroommates who accompanied him deny that the young man was actually \nurinating. Still, the officer called five additional policemen and arrested \nWilliams in a very brutal way which led to a laceration in his face, bruised \nribs, a black eye, and scrapes on his torso. In the process of the arrest one of \nthe officers called the three men “faggots” which led to an exchange of \nabusive language on both sides. Tony Maenza, one of the roommates, \nvideotaped the incident and the arrest with his cell phone camera.248 After \nhe indicated that he had videotaped the situation several police officers, who \ninitially told them to go home, changed their minds, followed them and \narrested Maenza and Ben Collins without sharing the legal basis for the \narrest. They were held in custody for more than 24 hours before they were \nallowed to go home. The video was still on the cell phone since the officers \nwere not able to get past the security password. Eventually, the New York \nCity Anti-Violence Project uploaded the video clip on YouTube seven days \nafter the incident. In the meantime more than 61,111 views have been \nrecorded (date: June 3, 2017). However, apart from this step hardly any \nsocial media activity was noticed. Twitter, for example, does not list any \nTweets with the hashtags #JoshWilliams #policeviolence. Only a few local \nnewspapers reported about the confrontation. The community remained \nalmost completely silent.  \nAnother video clip that went viral on YouTube in 2013 was an \nincident in a New Yorker subway train at the day of the gay pride parade in \nNew York City. A group of young LGBTQ*s was faced with homophobic \ninsults expressed by two men on the train. In addition, one of them \nthreatened to rape the young lesbian women. Hearing the insults and threats, \na female bystander started to videotape the incident with her phone. One of \nthe perpetrators attacked the woman who was videotaping after grasping her \nintention and tried to destroy the phone. He injured the woman slightly \nwhile doing so. The gay bashing continued, became more intense and \nultimately also physical when one of the offenders put his hand around the \nneck of a young queer woman. After a few more minutes of a heated \n                                                 \n248 “Anti-LGBTQ police violence in Bed-Stuy Brooklyn, Sunday June 3, 2013,” YouTube \nvideo, 03:08.

The video circulated on YouTube and was watched more than \n1,137,418 times (date: June 3, 2017).249 It is not possible to determine which \nfeelings stirred the viewers’ decision to watch the video: widespread \nconcern or craving for sensation. It might have been a combination of both. \nWhat can be said for sure is that, except from the uploaded video and local \nnews reports, no outcry was discernable and the perpetrators were never \ncaught – at least no reports on an arrest were published in online media. It \nappears as if the community has drifted towards a state of isolation; an \nemotional isolation from the heteronormative society as well as from one \nanother; an isolation that is serving the intention to protect oneself from the \nmental implications that might result from the confrontation with acts of \ndirect violence. The initiator to upload the video was the initial bystander \nwho started to videotape the situation – not the affected gays and lesbians. \nBoth cases discussed show that incidents like these have resulted in \nexhaustion and stimulated a skepticism that the situation can be changed; \nthey are endured by the community because they have become part of \nLGBTQ*s’ daily life. \n \nThe following year, 2014, has seen many incidents of direct violence \nagainst lesbians and gays. Similar to the incidents of the previous years, \nsocial media representation remained in most of the cases low. The beating \nof J.P. Masterson in a subway in New York City was hardly discussed – \nonly a few LGBTQ* online newspapers published a minor amount of \narticles. Social media activity regarding direct violence against gays and \nlesbians was hardly detectable over the next few months. The felony that \neventually stirred the public outrage and social media activity was the \nbeating of two gay men in Philadelphia, PA. Philadelphia is known among \nthe community as very LGBTQ* friendly and liberal. The brutal beating \nthat occurred on September 11, 2014 raised much criticism. Zachary Hesse \nand his boyfriend, Andrew Haught, were verbally harassed by a group of \n                                                 \n249 “LGBT Hate Crime New York Subway,” YouTube video, 05:30.

The physical injuries included multiple \nfractures of the face, a broken jaw which required the victim’s mouth to be \nwired shut for eight weeks, and several other bleeding wounds. The \nperpetrators were caught on a surveillance camera and the shots were \nreleased to the public a few days later. The Philly hate crime was the first \natrocity against LGBTQ*s that was solved with the help of social media. \nAfter the photographs of the offenders were released, a Twitter user called \nGreg Bennett posted a picture of a group having dinner at a restaurant which \nhe had received from a friend at third-hand. Some of the young men and \nwomen were obviously the same as in the photographs which the police had \nreleased. Another Twitter user, FanSince09, therefore decided to re-tweet it, \nhoping that someone of his several thousand followers would be able to \nidentify one of the people or at least the place where they had spent the \nnight on this particular day. Shortly after posting the tweet he received the \ninformation that the restaurant was La Viola, an Italian place in Center City. \nFanSince09, who wants to remain anonymous, was subsequently able to \nidentify three of the perpetrators via the restaurant’s Facebook page. The \noffenders had “checked-in” at the restaurant’s page, meaning that they had \nshared on La Viola’s Facebook page that they visited that place at that night \nin question.251 Social media became the tool to find the alleged suspects. \nThe story spread quickly and the medial attention rocketed. The positive \neffect was definitely that people were confronted with the reality of hate \ncrimes against gays and lesbians and also that the focus shifted to the \nabsence of hate crime laws regarding sexual orientation and gender identity \nin Philadelphia’s city legislation. In the aftermath of the gay bashing, \nCouncilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown and Councilman Jim Kenney \n                                                 \n250 David Chang, “Gay Couple Speaks Out After Brutal Assault in Center City,” NBC \nPhiladelphia, September 19, 2014, accessed September 6, 2016, \nhttp://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Gay-Couple-Speaks-Out-After-Brutal-Assault-\nin-Center-City-275226821.html. \n251 Enid Shaw, “Philly Hate Crime Suspects Tracked Down by Anonymous Twitter Hero,” \nGawker, September 16, 2014, accessed September 9, 2016, http://gawker.com/philly-hate-\ncrime-suspects-tracked-down-by-anonymous-tw-1635661609.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    157 \n \nintroduced a new hate crime bill including sexual orientation, gender \nidentity and disabilities. On October 30, 2014, more than two months after \nthe respective assault in which the District Attorney was unable to prosecute \nit as a hate crime due the lack of the necessary legislation, the City Council \nunanimously passed the bill. Councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown \ndeclared:  \n \nWe are not brought into this world with hate in our hearts; that is \nsomething learned along the way. This is a teaching moment not only \nfor the bullies out there, but for the parents of bullies. We all have a \nresponsibility to protect one another. My heart hurts for all people \nwho are targeted because of who they are. No one has a right to \ndiminish someone else’s shine, and our message today is, if you think \nit is appropriate to hurt someone with hate in your heart, there will be \na price to pay.252 \n \nThe beating of the two gays had a positive side-effect. It created awareness \nand it stirred people to reflect on the current situation LGBTQ*s are facing. \nFurthermore, it led to the City Council’s decision to charge people also for \nthe hate penetrating their thoughts and behavior, that provokes violence and \nthat destroys any empathy. This particular hate crime and the social media \nactivity in the aftermaths initiated a change. This is exactly what the \nrepresentation of direct violence in social media should invoke. The \nsuspects were eventually charged. Philip Williams and Kevin Harrigan both \npleaded guilty to conspiracy and – in the case of Philip Williams – \naggravated assault, and in Kevin Harrigan’s case simple assault. Both \nreceived sentences on probation and were banned from downtown \nPhiladelphia during their probation time. Kathryn Knott, who had also been \ncharged, was found guilty of simple assault, conspiracy and reckless \n                                                 \n252 Blondell Reynolds Brown, “Hate Crime Bill Passes City Council,” City Council \nPhiladelphia, October 30, 2014, accessed September 9, 2016, http://phlcouncil.com/hate-\ncrime-bill-passes-city-council/.  \n \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    158 \n \nendangerment.253 Knott had a prominent role in the case that was exploited \nby the media. As she was the daughter of a police chief, she became the face \nof the hate crime attack. This was additionally stirred by the fact that she \nhad tweeted anti-gay messages even before the incident occurred.254 \nUltimately, Knott was sentenced to five to ten months in prison from which \nshe was released on July 12, 2016 after serving a bit more than five months \nof her sentence. The outstanding fact of the Philly hate crime was that social \nmedia were the decisive tool to find and prosecute the offenders and that it \nhas simultaneously created awareness.255 Furthermore, the hate crime has \ncreated change. The city of Philadelphia passed its own hate crime \nlegislation which opens up the opportunity to charge someone with a hate \ncrime in district courts. In contrast, New York City, which had been facing \nso many hate crimes against gays and lesbians in 2013, had already had hate \ncrime legislations since the Hate Crimes Act of 2000. A reaction to the wave \nof violence would have had to involve new strategies to find perpetrators or \nsecure districts which showed a high number of violent attacks. However, \nnone of this has happened.  \nAnother striking case became the murder of Dionte Greene, a 22-\nyear old black gay man from Kansas City, Missouri. Green was shot dead in \nOctober 2014 and it became one of the atrocities against lesbians and gays \nthat made the social media news. Greene intended to meet a “trade” on \nOctober 30, 2014. The expression “trade” is almost exclusively used in the \nblack LGBTQ* community and “describes a man who doesn’t ‘appear gay’ \nbut who engages in sex with men unbeknownst to his family and most of his \n                                                 \n253 Associated Press, “Philly hate crime update: Kathryn Knott convicted of simple assault \nand reckless endangerment,” LGBTQ Nation, December 18, 2015, accessed September 9, \n2016, http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/12/philly-hate-crime-update-kathryn-knott-\nconvicted-of-simple-assault-and-reckless-endangerment/.  \n254 LGBTQ Nation, “Philly hate crime: Kathryn Knott sentenced to 5-10 months in prison,” \nLGBTQ Nation, February 8, 2016, accessed September 9, 2016, \nhttp://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/02/philly-hate-crime-kathryn-knott-sentenced-to-5-10-\nmonths-in-prison/. \n255 There have been voices criticizing the use of the social media for the search of \ndelinquents because it is so easily possible to prejudge alleged suspects in a public sphere \nwhich could ruin an innocent’s reputation and life. This is definitely something one has to \nbe careful with and which has to be considered by the police before releasing any \ninformation to the public.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    159 \n \nfriends.”256 After being killed in his car while waiting for the man Greene \nwanted to meet, it appeared as if the young black gay man was shot by his \n“trade” for being gay. This was the story that made the news – even though \nonly limited. However, Greene’s murder is noteworthy for several reasons: \nDionte Greene was an African-American man who was murdered at a \nmoment in U.S. history when the whole world’s focused on violence against \nAfrican-Americans. The killing took place in the same state that became site \nof massive protests against violence once the young black man, Michael \nBrown, was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. \nHowever, the outrage after the murder of Dionte Greene was not \ncomparable to the reactions after the shooting of Michael Brown. There \nmight be two explanations for this fact: Firstly, it was quickly assumed that \nthe perpetrator was black himself as the “trade” was supposed to be a black \nman and all evidence suggested that Greene’s date was the murderer. It \nstands to reason that the media would have been more interested and \ntherefore the public would have been much more agitated if the killer had \nsupposedly been white or if police violence had been involved. Secondly, \nthe victim was a gay black man in a Midwestern state dominated by rural \nareas and cities that do not exceed the population of 500,000. Among the \nAfrican-American community homosexuality is still a contested topic. Polls \nhave shown that African-Americans are less likely to support same-sex \nmarriage.257 Additionally, the proportion of black Americans who believe \nthat people are born gay or lesbian is half the number (26 percent vs. 52 \npercent) of those defined as white.258 More than half (58 percent) of those \nAfrican-Americans questioned stated that they would be upset if they had a \ngay child.259 Consequently, the fundament for creating a popular outrage \nwas not promising at all. Social media activity was low and the hate crime \n                                                 \n256 Zach Stafford, “Black, gay and shot dead in his own car: this is another Missouri killing \nwe should talk about,” The Guardian, December 2, 2014, accessed September 16, 2016, \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/02/-sp-missouri-killing-dionte-\ngreene?CMP=twt_gu.  \n257 Pew Research Center, “Support for Same-Sex Marriage at Record High, but Key \nSegments Remain Opposed,” Pew Research Center, June 8, 2015, accessed December 20, \n2016, http://www.people-press.org/2015/06/08/support-for-same-sex-marriage-at-record-\nhigh-but-key-segments-remain-opposed/.  \n258 Ibid. \n259 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    160 \n \nallegations were eventually dropped from the charges that the two alleged \nperpetrators – one of them was the man Greene intended to meet – had to \nface. The offenders stated that their intention was to rob Greene and that his \nhomosexuality was not decisive. The case shows, like many others before, \nthat the hate crime legislation is insufficient and ineffective. The number of \nstates that provide hate crime legislations on a state level is still moderate.260 \nAdditionally, hate crime prosecutions entail the challenge to extract \nevidence for one’s true intention to perform an act of direct violence. On a \nsubjective level it will also be difficult to prove the perpetrator’s motivation \nto act violently.  \n \n                                                 \n260 “State Maps of Laws & Policies – Hate Crime Legislation,” The Human Rights \nCampaign, accessed June 11, 2017, http://www.hrc.org/state-maps/hate-crimes.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    161 \n \nMissouri is one of the states that have hate crime laws which cover sexual \norientation and gender identity. Nevertheless, reality shows that hate crime \ncharges are often dropped or bargained in exchange for a plea of guilt. The \nreason for this development is easily explained with the concept of \nintersectionality. Using the case of Dionte Greene as an example, it becomes \napparent that most victims contain several characteristics that might \nconstitute someone as a target: Greene was black and gay, but the fact that \nhe was attacked by two black men might also suggest that the crime could \nbe attributed to the category of class as a determining factor. Crimes are \noften simply defined as gang rivalries if black men are involved.  \nIt is difficult to delineate which features led to the perpetrator’s \ndecision to choose Greene and to pull the trigger. The same applies to the \nvicious attack on the lesbian couple Mollie Judith Olgin and Mary Kristene \nChapa mentioned before. As the offender still denies his guilt and has not \nmade a public statement, it remains unclear if Olgin and Chapa became \nvictims due to their sexual orientation or simply because of the fact that they \nwere female. There are always several characteristics that might correlate \nand induce a reaction – intentionally or not. This is also well-represented by \nthe case of Stephanie Dorceant, a black lesbian woman in her twenties who \nwas attacked in July 2015 by an off-duty cop. Stephanie Dorceant and her \ngirlfriend Nandi Allman were on their way home after a night out when a \nwhite man crossed their path and bumped into them. According to \nDorceant’s Facebook post she asked him if he was okay when he started to \nshout “mind [your] own business ‘you fucking dyke!’”261 Immediately \nafterwards he allegedly attacked Dorceant who eventually ended up in \ncustody after several police officers had arrived at the scene and arrested \nDorceant and her girlfriend. Several characteristics correlated in this case: \nDorceant was not only black but also lesbian and not exactly gender-\nconforming. One might ask which category has led to the man’s reaction but \nthis question misses the point. All these categories combined might have \ntriggered the man’s reaction and Dorceant was aware of that: \n                                                 \n261 Made Moiselle, Facebook post, July 13, 2015, 06:51 p.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/StephanieGPD/posts/10106430134850063.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    162 \n \n \nHer Facebook post on July 16, 2015262 states a variety of hashtags including \n#lgbt, #blacklivesmatter, #womensrights and #sayhername. The later one \nrepresents a campaign that tries to raise awareness for disproportionally \nhigh gender-based anti-black police violence against black women with a \nstrong focus on gay or queer women.263 All hashtags combined represent the \nidentity categories that probably led to the attack on Stephanie Dorceant. \nTherefore, all of them have to be approached. Strategies must be developed \nto face all challenges ahead. Distinguishing between potential causes is \nneither possible nor useful. Being homosexual increases the risk of \nbecoming a victim of violence and the interplay with other characteristics \nshould not negate the fact that sexual orientation might have additionally \ntriggered a violent act. This correlation between several aspects can not be \nthe grounds for neglecting an essential motivation to use violence against \nanother person; especially, as the consequence is the inefficiency of a law \nthat is supposed to diminish direct violence against a minority group.  \n \nThe year 2015 was dominated by a similar pattern in social media \nactivity on violence against lesbian and gays as the years before. Selected \nincidents made headlines due to some distinguishing factors. The majority \nof cases, however, did not receive any social media coverage. The \ndominating debates remained the same, progress was rare. The first act of \nviolence that received some social media attention in 2015 was the beating \n                                                 \n262 Made Moiselle, Facebook post, July 16, 2015, 10:42 p.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/StephanieGPD/posts/10106441269052033.  \n263 “#SayHerName,” African American Policy Forum, accessed January 27, 2017, \nhttp://www.aapf.org/sayhername/.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    163 \n \nof a gay couple in Huntington, West Virginia. The reason for making \nheadlines was that the offender was a young black college football player by \nthe name of Steward Butler. Butler allegedly used anti-gay slurs and \neventually attacked Zackery Johnson and Casey Williams after he had seen \nthe couple kissing. The football player, who was dismissed from the team \nafter the incident had gone viral, is being charged with violating an \nindividual’s civil rights and a misdemeanor battery charge. Even though the \nattack was obviously a hate crime, it was not possible to indict Butler with a \nhate crime charge. West Virginia does not have sexual orientation included \nin its hate crime legislation. Still, the district attorney tried to charge him on \na hate crime law condemning crimes due to a person’s sex saying that the \ncouple would never have been attacked if one of them had been female. The \ncourt did not see any admissibility and thereby highlighted the necessity of \nimplementing hate crime laws based on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity in West Virginia. The trial is still pending and even though a \ncelebrated college football player was involved, media representation was \nlimited to posts of individuals and re-tweets of online articles. Instead \nderogatory statements via Twitter supporting Steward Butler and harassing \nthe gay couple, implying that they deserve what they had gotten spread.264265  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n264 OleFanwvu, Twitter post, May 6, 2015, 12:02 a.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/olefanwvu/status/596027342465716224.  \n265 EclecticMan, Twitter post, May 6, 2015, 07:51 p.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/ManEclectic/status/596145207705346050.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    164 \n \n \n \nAll these cases exposed, that the representation of direct violence in \nsocial media remains low if the survivors do not speak out themselves. \nInstead, individuals post occasional messages – either to condemn the act of \nviolence or to justify it. However, they hardly provoke a deeper debate as \nseen in the case of the above posts supporting Steward Butler. Instead, the \nincidents soon vanish from notice.  \nThe alternative scenario discernible was the emergence of small and \nspontaneously activated movements if an atrocity was extremely violent and \nshocking for the community. However, the activism against LGB violence \nemerged quickly, reached the surface and evaporated shortly afterwards. \nThe murder of Mark Carson had such an effect and it remained the only one \nthat resulted in such an outcry since the brutal killing of Matthew Shepard – \nat least until June 2016. In the meantime, the attempted beating of another \ngay couple reached some social media attention. Again, the decisive cause \nfor the public perception was a Facebook post by one of the attacked gay \nmen266.  \n \n                                                 \n266 Larry Lennox-Choate III, Facebook post, August 2, 2015, 04.50 a.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/larry.choate/posts/10100220517647780.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    165 \n \n \n \nLarry Lennox-Choate III and his husband were assaulted by a stranger in a \nstore in Soho. However, Lennox-Choate III and his husband Daniel Lennox-\nChoate, who are both West Point graduates, were able to defend themselves. \nAfter the incident took place, Larry Lennox-Choate III decided to speak out \nand take action against LGB violence and hate crimes in general. In his first \nFacebook post right after the beating he refused to be victimized and \nilluminated his intention to respond with strength and vehemence. \nNevertheless, he also stated clearly that he is well aware that not everybody \nis able to defend him- or herself. Therefore, he calls for vigorous activism \nagainst hate crimes and violence:  \n \nInstead of hashing it out in the comments section of a news article, \nreach out to your political representatives and call for zero tolerance \npolicies that aim to make good on the promise that all men (and \nwomen, of course) actually are created equal in this country. Find an \norganization, either local or national, that takes up this cause and tries \nto stand up for every victim of this sort of heinous crime. Let's be the \ngeneration that says ENOUGH!267 \n                                                 \n267 Larry Lennox-Choate III, Facebook post, August 5, 2015, 06:03 p.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/larry.choate/posts/10100221432354700. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    166 \n \n \nBoth Facebook posts were shared – the first one even 328 times. The initial \npost has received 6,515 likes (date: June 3, 2017) while the second one was \nclose to a thousand likes (date: June 3, 2017 – 916 likes). If victims reach \nout to the public, direct violence receives the attention that would be needed \nto build a strong and effective movement against it. Those affected have to \nbe the ones who call attention to these incidents but they also have to be \nsupported by the community.  \nAnother case that proves this right is the beating of the student John \nMateer. In October 2015, Mateer spoke out after he had become a victim of \ndirect violence in the aftermath of a fraternity party at the Sigma Nu house \nat Pennsylvania State University on October 4, 2015. He was verbally and \nphysically attacked by a stranger and ended up unconscious on the street. \nAfter he was able to get home, Mateer tweeted “Don’t let a frat guy know \nthat you’re gay”268, assuming that he had been attacked by a fellow frat \nmember. The tweet was deleted after it ultimately turned out that the \noffender was not a member of the fraternity. Nevertheless, after tweeting \nabout the atrocity and including photographs of his facial wounds the social \nmedia community startled. John Mateer’s tweets were re-tweeted several \nhundred times and additionally, his Facebook friend Matt Weyl posted an \naccount of the attack which was shared over a 1,500 times (date: September \n21, 2016 – 1,501 times; date: June 3, 2017 – 1,496 times).269 \n \n                                                 \n268 Daniel Craig, “Man says he was beaten by PSU fraternity member because he's gay,” \nPhillyVoice, October 5, 2015, accessed September 21, 2016, \nhttp://www.phillyvoice.com/man-says-beaten-psu-fraternity-brother-gay/.  \n269 Matt Weyl, Facebook post, October 4, 2015, 06:20 p.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/mattweyl/posts/10205153528261769. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    167 \n \n   \n \nAgain, the reactions ranged from shock to anger and sadness as well as \ndisbelief. The exposure of photographs of obvious injuries amplifies the \noutrage and the yearning for change and improvements.  \nEvery single incident of direct violence reported on social media \nintends to provoke a reaction. The endeavor can only be to reach out to the \nLGBTQ* community as well as to the general public and force them to \ndiscern the reality and stimulate the feeling that a proactive attitude is \nneeded. The attempts of individuals to raise awareness and to expose the \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    168 \n \ndirect violence gays and lesbians experience on a regular basis can only be \nthe beginning. The vulnerability gays and lesbians have to live with and the \nhighlighting of a shared fate and sorrow is a significant bond that ties the \ncommunity to a collective identity and which therefore has the potential to \nestablish a fundament for an effective movement against direct violence \ncomparable to the one focusing on structural violence. To reach this effect a \nstruggle for power and self-determination has to be fought and the \ncommunity has to actively engage in this battle by harnessing social media. \nJohn Mateer, Larry Lennox-Choate III, Nick Porto and all those affected by \ndirect violence who have been speaking out have one thing in common: \nThey refuse to be victimized and instead try to regain power over their lives \nand destinies. Becoming a victim of direct violence will always result in a \nloss of trust; the trust in society, in the community, in the belief that there is \na line nobody will cross; the line of physical integrity. Direct violence not \nonly breaks bones, but also the faith in the good will of people. One’s body \nis harmed and the only way to conquer the fear, the loss of trust and the \nvictimization is by speaking out. Violence is about power and exercising \nviolence, harming a person is the ultimate act of subordinating the one \ntargeted. This subordination can only be overturned if the “victim” fights \nback by engaging in a public discourse aiming at subverting the fundament \nof violence. Violence has to be conquered by raising awareness and thereby \nchallenging society’s heteronormativity and simultaneously finding virtues \nthat ally LGBTQ*s despite their differences. The reason why acts of direct \nviolence do not have the same binding effect like the experience of \nstruggling for marriage equality is that it does not directly affect each and \nevery individual LGBTQ* personally. Even more: The human being is \nsteadily constraining any thought that might suggest that direct violence \ncould affect oneself. This act of self-protection is crucial to maintain the \ntrust into one’s own integrity and the good nature of humanity. Loosing this \ntrust would result in a life of fear and misery. However, not engaging in a \nmovement against direct violence means that the people directly affected are \nleft without any structures that support them and will face tremendous \ndifficulties to regain power and escape the destiny of victimization. \nPsychological studies have shown that acts of direct violence will have \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    169 \n \nlong-lasting effects on the ones affected. Posttraumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD) are common and especially high among LGBTQ*s.270 The higher \nrisk is directly linked to sexual orientation minorities’ greater exposure to \nviolence as well as their exposure to potentially more traumatic events – \nespecially at early ages.271 As shown above, the representation of direct \nviolence against LGBTQ*s in social media suggests that the community’s \nsupport is low. Even though the reasons for this are slightly understandable \nin respect to the intention of self-protection, it still shows that the LGBTQ* \nmovement is also infiltrated by the neoliberal virtues of ignorance and \negoism. While the experience of unequal treatment has become the \ndominating unifying construct for the development of a collective identity, \ndirect violence is neglected. The manifestations of structural violence in \ndaily life or in the denial of same-sex marriage affects every LGB(TQ)*. \nEngaging in a movement will be an act of empowerment and ultimately lead \nto the realization of one’s own aspiration. However, participating in a \nmovement against direct violence does not necessarily bring benefits if the \nperson who takes an active part in the interest group has never been affected \nby direct violence her- or himself. The advantage remains abstract and the \nsatisfaction will not reach the same level as in some cases of structural \nviolence. The individual LGBTQ* acts egoistically – exactly how the \nneoliberal system has taught society.  \nThe refusal to embrace direct violence and transform it into a \npotential source of stimulus for the LGBTQ* movement for empowerment \nhas weakened the community altogether. Even though the discussion of \ndirect violence against LGBTQ*s is tough, it has to be led ultimately. And \nthe time has come: The year 2016 saw a horrific outburst of direct violence \nagainst LGBTQ*s that possessed the power to transform the movement \ncompletely. On June 12, 2016, 49 people of the LGBTQ* community lost \ntheir lives in a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The club that epitomized the \ncenter of a vibrant gay Latin-American culture became a place of death. 29-\nyear old Omar Mateen entered Pulse Nightclub around 2 a.m. while the \n                                                 \n270 Andrea L. Roberts et al., “Pervasive Trauma Exposure Among US Sexual Orientation \nMinority Adults and Risk of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,” Am J Public Health, \nDecember 2010; 100(12): 2433–2441. \n271 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    170 \n \nparty-goers celebrated Latin night and immediately started shooting, using a \nsemi-automatic weapon. 49 women and men were hit mortally; 53 were \nseriously wounded. The shooting has gone into history as the most \ndestructive shooting in the United States’ recent history – up until 2017. The \nLGBTQ* community has never had to face a deathlier single act of direct \nviolence. The Pulse and Orlando will always stand for a moment that has \nchanged the community – but will it also represent a turning point for the \nLGBTQ* movement? Suddenly, becoming a victim of direct violence was \nno longer an abstract scenario. Orlando exposed its vulnerability to the \ncommunity. It showed lesbian and gays the insufficiency of the current level \nof aspired equality. It showed every single individual of the community that \nLGBTQ*s are targets and that the successes achieved are jeopardized. It \nalso exposed that there lays a long way ahead before equality can be reached \nand a social climate be created that does not encourage violence against \nLGBTQ*s. And it additionally illuminated that the current political and \nsocial situation is more multifaceted and difficult than imagined which will \nbe discussed in the next chapter.  \nThe impact and the destructiveness of the mass shooting are \nprobably difficult to imagine for people not identifying as gay, bisexual, \nlesbian or transgender. As delineated before, living in a heteronormative \nsociety is tied to structural and direct violence in multiple of outgrowths. \nAny kind of displaying affection, like holding hands or kissing, can be the \ntrigger that makes someone else comment on you, shout at you, harass and \nbully you or even hurt you physically. Living openly as a homosexual \nindividual and/or couple is always tied to negative responses and \nreservations. There is hardly a day on which you will not perceive \ndisapproving looks or face any derogatory comments. It has definitely \ngotten better over the last decades but still: This is the reality of LGBTQ*s \nliving in the 21st century in Western societies. Over the years, lesbian and \ngays have created safe havens; spaces where they can be themselves, where \nno one will question your sexual and/or gender identity, your way of living \nyour life, your right to love someone of the same sex. The concept of safe \nspaces has been applied gradually to those places and spaces which have an \nimmense importance to the LGBTQ* community. Originating from a \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    171 \n \nconcept constituted within the educational sector, safe spaces depict a \nwelcoming space free of “homophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism.”272 \nThe LGBTQ* community adapted the concept of safe spaces to all spaces \nwhere lesbians and gays were protected from violence and could be \nthemselves. Most urban centers have seen the development of gay-towns \nand, – if not – have at least gay bars that create a feeling of belonging and \nconstitute a safe space. No gay or lesbian person will ever forget the feeling \nof relief, inner peace and happiness that one has experienced when spending \nthe first night in a queer safe space. Suddenly, you realize that this is it and \nthat you belong amidst the people surrounding you; that no one in this space \nwill question your sexual orientation or gender identity. You are safe and \nfree.  \nOmar Mateen destroyed that safe space within a few seconds that \nstretched into hours – not only for the more than a hundred people in Pulse \nbut also for the rest of the LGBTQ* community. This is the decisive reason \nwhy the mass shooting in Pulse has prompted the reaction of the LGBTQ* \ncommunity that has become visible in social media immediately after the \nnews of the shooting was released. The agony and the shock were \ncrucifying, the frustration and anger were growing steadily. Especially the \nabuse of the shooting from conservatives like the Republican presidential \ncandidate Donald Trump in particular led to an extreme outrage within the \nLGBTQ* community. Degrading the shooting to an attack motivated solely \nby a radical-Islamic sentiment of the offender is definitely one-sided and \nwould be dishonoring the victims of the event. Donald Trump quickly \nembraced the shooting and called it a terrorist attack even before condoling \nthe victims and family members. One of his first tweets after the incident \nstated: “Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, \nI don’t want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!”273 \nThe LGBTQ* community responded quickly to remarks like the above or \nother feigned sympathies:  \n                                                 \n272 Catherine O.

Noah Michelson’s post274 \nmediates all emotions he felt after Pulse; it mediates grieve but also disgust \nfor those people who have ostracized the community for a long time. The \nconstant degradation and revulsion coming from conservative right-wingers \nand radical religious leaders have contributed to a climate of disrespect, hate \nand disapproval of homosexuality. Hearing and seeing exactly these people \nabusing the hate crime for their political agenda was too much to bear for \nmany LGBTQ*s. They started to shift the focus to the real problem \nmanifested in U.S. society – heteronormativity and homophobia. The \nTwitter user @EffyDxn re-tweeted a Facebook message on June 15, \n2016275:  \n \nYou weren’t the gunman, but you didn’t want to see gay people \nkissing in public. You weren’t the gunman, but you don’t like gay \ncharacters on TV. You weren’t the gunman, but you think gay people \nare sinful and need saving.  \n \n                                                 \n274 Noah Michelson, Facebook post, June 13, 2016, 00:37 a.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153582231872823&set=a.215722862822.13\n1915.548627822&type=3&theater.  \n275 Elyssa Edwards, Twitter post, June 15, 2016, 10:48 a.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/EffyDxn/media.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    173 \n \nYou weren’t the gunman, but you were upset when gay people gained \nthe right to marry. You weren’t the gunman, but you use slurs for gay \npeople. You weren’t the gunman, but you would vote against legal \nprotections for gay people. \n \nYou weren’t the gunman, but you’re the culture that built him. You’re \nthe bullets in his gun.276 \n \nThe culture that built him; the culture that fostered a structure \ndisadvantaging lesbians and gays; the culture that subordinated \nhomosexuals and implemented a rule of heteronormativity; structural and \ndirect violence closely correlate with each other. Where structural violence \ndominates society, direct violence will be easily justifiable. If politics is not \nable to implement laws protecting minorities efficiently, direct violence will \nnot be prosecuted to its fullest that might entail the power to prevent hate \ncrimes. Lesbians and gays all over the United States (and worldwide) \nilluminated the challenge that comes along with a culture that makes it easy \nto judge and to hate and that alienates people from one another; their posts \nshow how this climate fuels the discourse with hate that frustrates LGBTQ* \npeople to an extent that creates despair and isolation; isolations that leads to \nmessages like the one above. \nThe shooting at Pulse was too much for many lesbians and gays. It \nwas the incident that forced them to speak out openly against violence in all \nshades. It forced lesbians and gays to acknowledge that not everything has \ngotten better and that it is not even certain if it will ever get better at all. It \nmade many lesbians and gays aware that a stronger and more efficient \nmovement is needed. At the same time, resignation and hopelessness \nbecame more and more visible between the lines.  \n \n                                                 \n276 Elyssa Edwards, Twitter post, June 15, 2016, 10:48 a.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/EffyDxn/media. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    174 \n \n \n \nThe desperation that James Cerne must have felt while writing this message \nand especially his last paragraph is easy to detect: “You can be as \nenlightened as fuck but you still have to carry all of that with you. All the \ntime. All the hate and all the reasons why you don’t measure up. 50 dead. I \nwant to fucking explode.”277 Cerne, as well as many other users, did not \nnarrow the incident down to its physical nature but instead identified its \nsocio-political context. Pulse was not exclusively about the shooting per se \nbut also about society’s reaction to it: hypocritical phrases and condolences, \na misrecognition of the treatment of LGBTQ*s in society, a mother who is \n                                                 \n277 James Cerne, Facebook post, June 12, 2016, 08:08 p.m., \nhttps://www.facebook.com/james.cerne/posts/10153654710641099.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    175 \n \nworried for her child and asks him not to join the gay pride parade; a \nreaction that simultaneously illuminates that she does not apprehend the \nimportance of her gay child’s participation in the parade; his urge to live his \npride and to be himself no matter what. Pulse imposed a state of emergency \non LGBTQ* people and it hit them with full force. Many Facebook and \nTwitter posts of LGBTQ*s and their supporters exposed a consistent \nresponse: Shock, disbelief, grieve and the consensus that direct violence has \nto stop, that it is enough, but also that the tools for containment are \nambiguous. The struggle against structural and direct violence has been \nfought for so many decades and still advances regarding the restraint of \ndirect violence are low. Only 16 states possess a hate crime legislation \ncovering sexual orientation and gender identity, 14 states address sexual \norientation only.278 All remaining 20 states do not cover sexual orientation \nor gender identity in its hate crime legislation or do not even offer any hate \ncrime laws. The political and social reality is not comforting and satisfying. \nIncidents like Orlando lead to an aggravation of the psychological state of \nlesbians and gays as they are suddenly no longer able to ignore the points \nthat do not get better. Suddenly, the illusions that improvements have led to \nless violence against lesbians, gays and bisexuals were destroyed. Their \nworld and safe heaven were shaken. The reaction of individuals was \ntherefore much higher and more extreme than in all cases of direct violence \ndiscussed before. Additionally, gay rights organizations started reacting and \nrealizing that direct violence has to be recognized and opposed. Two weeks \nafter the atrocity, the Human Rights Campaign, the organization which had \ntremendous impact on undermining manifestations of unequal structures, \nposted a YouTube video that was shifted into the spotlight via Facebook and \nTwitter (clicks: 1,837,095 – date: October 13, 2016; clicks: 1.970.457 – \ndate: June 3, 2017). With the slogan “Stop the Hate”, 49 celebrities honored \nthe 49 victims of the Orlando shooting.279 The video starts with the simple \nmessage: “The victims live in our memories. These are their names. These \n                                                 \n278 “Maps of State Laws and Policies – Hate Crime Legislation,” Human Rights Campaign, \naccessed October 13, 2016, http://www.hrc.org/state_maps.  \n279 “Stop the Hate: 49 Celebrities Honor 49 Victims of Orlando Tragedy in Ryan Murphy-\nProduced Tribute,” YouTube video, 18:08.

The viewer of the video catches a glimpse of the lives \nof the 49 victims. The clip that lasts 18 minutes illuminates the past and the \nfuture that would have lain ahead of all of them. It demonstrates that the \nlives they led were similar to one’s own and that one could have been \namong the victims if the circumstances had been different. The clip ends \nwith the message expressed by Lady Gaga: “It’s time to stop the bleeding” \nand is followed by appeals to stop the hate and the slogan that love conquers \nhate. Both slogans are used by the social media community to circumscribe \ncalls against hate crimes and direct violence. The Human Rights Campaign \nmade some effort to revive their “Love conquers hate” campaign and \nadditionally adapted the hashtag #stopthehate more often than before the \nPulse shooting. Four months after the shooting HRC remembered the \nvictims and affirmed their intention to fight more efficiently against direct \nviolence and therefore called for supporters.  \nFurthermore, Pulse generated many public statements of celebrities \ncondemning violence against LGBTQ*s. One of them was again Lady \nGaga, who spoke out at a vigil in Los Angeles a day after the shooting. The \nvocalist condemned the attack and called it an “attack on humanity”.280 She \nalso stressed her solidarity with the LGBTQ* community:  \n \nBut tonight I will not allow my anger and outrage over this attack to \novershadow our need to honor those who are grieving truly for their \nlost ones; lost members of the LGBT community. I hope you know \nthat myself and so many are your allies. Not only me, but everyone \nhere. We represent the compassion and the loyalty of millions of \npeople around the world that believe in you. You are not alone, you \nare not alone.281 \n \n                                                 \n280 “Lady Gaga honors Orlando victims at Los Angeles vigil,” YouTube video, 09:42. \nPosted by Los Angeles LGBT Center, June 14, 2016, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0XODPy8zPE.  \n281  Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    177 \n \nThe sense of solidarity, the sense of a shared identity and of common values \nis visible between the lines. Lady Gaga showed many times that she is \naware of the meaning of a celebrity’s support and also of the power of the \nsocial media. Still, her support and her emotions always feel honest. Her \nvoice is heard all over the world by millions and millions of people – and \nshe can influence them. The Human Rights Campaign’s video has \neffectively used celebrities’ standing and their voices to promote their aims. \nDirect violence has to be addressed on a regular basis – not only mass \nshootings but also singular incidents that take place every single day. \nIndividuals targeted for their sexual orientation have to be shifted to the \nspotlight; they need to voice what they had to experience. But they also \nneed the support of celebrities that communicate the message to everybody \nnot affected by direct violence due to their sexual orientation. This is the \nmost promising way of raising awareness, undermining structures that foster \ndirect violence. This was exactly the strategy that was eventually successful \nin respect to legitimizing same-sex marriage. On a long-term basis, it will \nalso achieve successes in regards to direct violence.  \nAnother organization that also contributed to the highlighting of \ndirect violence against homosexuals and particularly Orlando was GLAAD \n(Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation). They organized vigils and \nspeeches the days after the shooting. Kristene Chapa, the young lesbian \nwoman who was attacked together with her girlfriend Molly Olgins in \nTexas, spoke at a rally for the victims of Pulse.282 This videoclip was \nuploaded to YouTube as well as the speech of the actor Wilson Cruz whose \naunt was killed in the shooting when she shielded her gay son, saving his \nlife.283 GLAAD also engaged in the production of a song in honor of the \nvictims. “Hands” calls for the end of hate and for promoting acceptance. It \nwas produced in honor of the victims of the shooting and financially \nbenefited their families. The song featured vocalists like Selena Gomez, \nP!nk, Jennifer Lopez and Adam Lambert and both uploaded videos received \n                                                 \n282 “Kristene Chapa speaks at rally for victims of Orlando shooting,” YouTube video, \n03:35.

They represent the diversity of sexual orientation and gender \nidentity without clearly pointing at it. These pictures are taking turns with \nsome photographs taken at vigils for the victims of the Pulse shooting, that \nshow the sorrow but also the solidarity. The striking message is that hate has \nto cease and that every individual deserves living a happy and fulfilling life \nand that this will only be achieved by standing together. The cooperation \nbetween gay rights organizations and celebrities in targeting direct violence \nhas thus been initiated in the aftermath of the shooting.  \nAdditionally, celebrities have also raised awareness without the \nimpulse of gay rights organizations. The song “The Greatest” by the \nAustralian vocalist Sia has been a tribute to the 49 people killed in Pulse. 49 \ndancers represent the victims of the shooting in the official video clip. It \nappears as if the protagonist, the ballet dancer Maddie Ziegler, tries to safe \nthe other dancers but eventually fails to do so. In the light of the music \nvideo the refrain, “Don’t give up; I won’t give up. Don’t give up, no no no”, \ndescribes the fight for survival, just like the men and women who fought for \ntheir lives in Pulse. However, the refrain also sounds like a credo for the \nsurvivors of the shooting as well as the LGBTQ* community altogether to \nstay strong and to continue the fight for equality and against direct and \nstructural violence. The video was watched more than 250 million times by \nDecember 2016 (254,813,048; date: December 5, 2016) and the comments \nsection recorded 130,421 posts (date: December 5, 2016).285 The number of \nviews increased to almost 445,000,000 by June 2017. It was additionally \nwidely discussed on other social media channels. \nThe lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres has also approached Pulse in \na – for her – typical way. DeGeneres had already addressed direct violence \nbefore – not only in the aftermath of the killing of Larry King by his \nclassmate Brandon McInerney but also at a vigil for Matthew Shepard. In \nher show on September 8, 2016, Tony Marrero, a Pulse survivor, joined the \n                                                 \n284 “Hands,” YouTube video, 04:24.

Marrero was \nshot four times in the back and miraculously survived. He was rescued by a \npolice officer who helped Marrero to drag himself out of the club. On the \nway to hospital Marrero’s heart stopped beating but he received two \nadrenalin shots and got reanimated. In the show, Marrero shared his \nexperiences and also the story of his heterosexual friend Luis Vilma’s who \ngot shot in Pulse. DeGeneres eventually surprised the young man with the \nappearance of the singer Katy Perry who was an essential support for \nMarrero’s recovery as he gained a lot of strength from her song “Rise”, as \nhe explained. The story of Tony Marrero clearly had an emotional impact on \nthe viewers of the show. Being shot four times and making a recovery from \nsuch a tragic event, in which Marrero lost one of his best friends, definitely \naffects anybody watching the clip of his journey. The combination of \nphotographs of the worldwide solidarity and Marrero’s speech in front of \ncolleagues that were mourning the death of their friend Luis Vilma creates \ndismay and compassion at the same time. Surviving an atrocity like the one \nin Orlando and facing the devastating reality of what happened to oneself \nand to beloved ones, represents, to some extent, heroism. Heroism is one of \nthe concepts that are upheld in American culture and society as very \ninfluential and defining. The county’s pop culture is dominated by the film \nindustry in Los Angeles. Hollywood has created masses of “heroes” over \nthe last decades and the symbolism of heroism within society has a high \nstanding and is a bonding tie. It often correlates with patriotism and the \nreputation of the U.S. military troops but is also perceived as an action that \nis characterized by facing circumstances that demand an extra-ordinary \namount of courage. Highlighting the personal grief and tragedy as well as \nthe recovery and retrieval of one’s life constructs a bond between the person \nwho is represented in the media and the viewers. This is exactly the result of \nthe appearance of Tony Marrero in the Ellen DeGeneres Show. The \nportrayal of Marrero’s story generated emotions among the viewers that \nmade them aware of the injustice, the horror and the pain lesbians and gays \nhave to face. At the same time, Marrero was depicted as a human being that \nlives, loves and has dreams like everyone else irrespective of his or her \nsexual orientation. The interview with Tony Marrero had the same effect as \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    180 \n \nthe video of the Human Right Campaign that has portrayed the victims of \nthe shooting: It breaks down barriers and it humanizes gays and lesbians. \nHomosexuality, which probably remains an abstract identity for many \nheterosexual people not familiar with gays, bisexuals or lesbians, becomes \nmore sizable and might even loose the awkwardness it sometimes might \nhave created. The structure justifying violence is destabilized, \nheteronormativity is undermined and a major step is taken to educate society \nand change social order. The shooting in Pulse had the effect that a range of \nindividuals as well as organizations adapted strategies similar to those \nacquired in the struggle against structural violence in daily life or the denial \nof same-sex marriage. Not only Twitter and Facebook users spoke out \nagainst the violence. Also Ellen DeGeneres and Lady Gaga, the Human \nRights Campaign and GLAAD have accepted the challenge the LGBTQ* \ncommunity faces every single day and reacted accordingly. They are the \nones who are able to empower the LGBTQ* community, who can stop the \nvictimization and instead, contribute to the implementation of change. They \ncreate visibility and awareness and they are the ones who can construct a \ncollective identity.  \nThe years prior to the rise of social media, the tools for fighting \ndirect violence have not been methodologically sound and a coherent \nmovement could not be developed. Orlando has initiated a broader and \nstronger response than all acts of direct violence since the murder of \nMatthew Shepard. The LGBTQ* movement has to maintain the vigor and \nthe acknowledgment that a united front to fight direct violence is as much \nneeded as a movement focusing on issues that can be classified as structural \nviolence. The organization and the players who are able to influence the \nsociety are out there and they have the capacity to additionally focus on \ndirect violence. Social media has proven to be of immense value; it \nconstitutes the tool that can influence people, create a collective identity and \nan influential movement. It might be the moment in time that the LGBTQ* \nmovement’s fight against direct violence is taking the next step. It is on the \nLGBTQ* movement to assure that the 49 LGBTQ* people as well as the \nstraight allies who have lost their lives in Pulse have not died in vain. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    181 \n \nIII. The Violence Triangle, Socio-Political \nInfluences and the Era of Donald Trump \n1. Past Influences on the LGBTQ* Movement \n \nThe way of LGBTQ* activism has changed over the last decades. It \nshifted to an activism dominated by a strong egotism and self-staging of the \nactors. Activism against LGBTQ* violence moved from the streets into the \nrealm of social media and the World Wide Web. As the analysis of social \nmedia activism has shown the social bond among activists is restricted to a \nshared experience of violence. Once LGBTQ* people are not directly \naffected by a certain form of violence, they hardly engage in social media \nactivism. \nThis has been proven by Nick Porto’s experiences when he shared \nhis story on social media. His posts conveyed that he felt neglected, isolated \nand desperate after he experienced direct violence. However, people’s \nresponses to his Facebook posts were a reflection of egotism and \nsuperficiality that has become so prominent in our times. Most reactions \nwere short messages of condolences but lacked honest emotions. Those \nmessages that transferred feelings of emotions and honest sympathy were \nposted by LGBTQ*s that experienced direct violence themselves and \ncriticized the community’s reluctance to challenge acts of direct violence. \nThe circumstance that Nick was told “to man up” and “grow some balls” by \ngay social media users is an excellent example for the deeply entrenched \negotism and ignorance of many members of the LGBTQ* community. \nMoreover, the discussions of the major gay rights organizations’ \nneglect of minorities within the communities has also illustrated that the \nsocial media movement and the LGBTQ* movements in general are \ncorrupted by a strong and pervasive egotism. Discrimination that affects the \nmajority of the community defines the activism on social media. The denial \nof same-sex marriage and manifestations of discrimination encountered on a \ndaily basis have become the core of the major gay rights organizations’ \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    182 \n \nstruggle. Activists have allocated much energy and resources to the \nexposure of these injustices – however, other LGBTQ* people are being \ncompletely marginalized and neglected. Topics that affect the majority of \nthe LGBTQ* communities receive the support that is necessary for political \nactivism. The attraction of a collective identity that ties the individual to the \ncause increases the base of activists. The expectation of benefiting from the \nmovement’s cause stimulates an individual’s disposition to contribute their \nshare. However, which profits arise for a lesbian or gay couple that earns \nmore than 80,000 US Dollar a year and is planning on getting married and \nraising children, if they engage in activism against homelessness among \nLGBTQ* youths? Apart from a feeling of satisfaction that might be stirred, \nthere is no striking revenue. Nowadays, one’s individual happiness and \naspirations always exceed the need to support minorities and fight for their \nrights while they have no voice. One’s personal gain is too low and \ntherefore engaging in time and energy-consuming activism does hardly \nentail any attraction. It is this kind of egotism that has been resulting from \nthe neoliberal culture; it is this egotism that is a major aspect of the \nneoliberal values cherished nowadays – even though the original intention \nwas a different one. Combined with ignorance it is also the stimulator for \nindividuals’ rejection of engaging in activism against workplace \ndiscrimination. If one has never been subject to bullying or denunciation at \nthe workplace, the very need to support those suffering from these \nmanifestations remains far-fetched. Those whose voice is currently not \nheard among the dominating group within the LGBTQ* movement could \nprofit from the integration of the violence triangle. The imminent threat of \ngetting fired from one day to the other due to ones homosexual or \ntransgender identity could be faced by integrating the violence triangle into \nthe discourse. Even though it is a major manifestation of structural violence, \nthis manifestation is still not contested; simply because one can protect him- \nor herself by hiding his or her sexual or gender identity or by switching jobs.  \nFurthermore, the difficult access to health care coverage for gay men \nis also among the neglected topics. An HIV infection has often been a \nreason for health insurance providers to deny coverage. Still, the LGBTQ* \nmovement does not adapt any major strategies to counter this injustice. As \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    183 \n \nmentioned in the beginning of this thesis, egotism is one of the most \ninfluential factors that stirred this trend. Combined with the era of social \nmedia which is also the age of self-staging, superficiality and ignorance, the \nneoliberal side-effect of egotism also turned the LGBTQ* movement into a \nfragmented construct unable to integrate the diversity of the community. \nThe results range from isolation and frustration to radicalization and despair. \nThis fragmentation is a major threat to the internal stability and success of \nthe movement. In addition to that, external factors imperil the achievements \nof the last years. While the policies implemented by the Obama \nadministration created a climate of hope for LGBTQ*s, conservatives \nexperienced frustration and repudiation. This stipulated a climate that \ncreates the basis for a backlash for the LGBTQ* movement. U.S. politics as \nwell as the society as such have become more polarized over the last two \ndecades. Combined with the liberal minority politics of the Obama \nadministration, these developments will rise to a major threat to all \nLGBTQ* people. It is essential to understand the socio-political climate for \nanalyzing the current LGBTQ* movement and assessing future \ndevelopments. Therefore, the next paragraphs will discuss the socio-\npolitical developments during the Obama Era and expose in which way \nthese evolutions have influenced U.S. society and to which extend these \ndevelopments impair the LGBTQ* movement nowadays and in the \nupcoming years.  \n \nThe polarization of the U.S. society in the midst of the Obama \npresidency becomes evident while studying reports of the Pew Research \nCenter. The number of people “who express consistently conservative or \nconsistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades from 10 \npercent to 21 percent.”286 The ideological overlap between the parties has \ndisappeared almost completely. The findings show that 92 percent of \nRepublicans are to the right of the median Democrat, and at the same time \n94 percent of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican. \n                                                 \n286 “Political Polarization in the American Public,” Pew Research Center, June 12, 2014, \naccessed December 21, 2016, http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-\npolarization-in-the-american-public/. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    184 \n \nFurthermore, partisan animosity has increased severely over the last twenty \nyears, but especially during the Obama presidency. While 16 percent of \nDemocrats were very unfavorable of Republicans in 1994, twenty years \nlater the number has risen to 38 percent. The percentage of Republicans \nvery unfavorable of Democrats has increase by 26 percent to 43 percent in \nthe period from 1994 to 2014. 36 percent of that number even considers the \nDemocratic Party a threat to the nation’s well-being. President Obama was \nperceived extremely negatively by the opposition; 84 percent of \nRepublicans disapproved his policy, 71 percent of them very strongly.287 In \nDecember 2016, the disapproval rating of Republicans has reached 68 \npercent.288 The percentages sample those of the Democratic approval rate \nfor President George W. Bush in 2008. The disapproval ratings among the \nopposite party with which Obama and Bush have been confronted have been \nthe highest, modern presidents received for more than have a century. No \npresident since 1953 had comparably high disapproval ratings among \nmembers of the opposite party as President Obama.289 What triggered this \ndevelopment over the last two decades? The list of reasons contributing to \nthis phenomenon is long. However, the evolution of the economic situation \nthat we are facing nowadays combined with the globalization have probably \ncontributed extensively. Neoliberalism alienated people from each other. It \nnot only widened the gap between rich and poor but also between those \nmeasuring up to the globalized world and those who feel estranged from the \nsocial, political and economic developments of the last years. Nowadays, \nlife and virtues are changing fast. Barack Obama has not only encouraged \nand supported progressive legislations in minority politics; he was also a \nsymbol of the fast-changing world. The election of a black man – even \nthough this does not mean that the institutionalized racism within the \npolitical and social structures has been dissolved290 – was a renunciation of \nthe rule of “white, old men”. The election already symbolized the citizens’ \n                                                 \n287 “Political Polarization in the American Public.” \n288 “Obama Leaves Office on High Note, But Public Has Mixed Views of \nAccomplishments,” Pew Research Center, December 14, 2016, accessed December 21, \n2016, http://www.people-press.org/2016/12/14/obama-leaves-office-on-high-note-but-\npublic-has-mixed-views-of-accomplishments/.  \n289 “Political Polarization in the American Public.”  \n290 Any discussions in the aftermaths circulating around the heralding of the era of post-\nracism had been naïve and were proven wrong by the Ferguson riots.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    185 \n \ndesire for change291, for the subversion of the “establishment”. Barack \nObama stirred change in a variety of spheres – even though it might not \nhave been in the way many had wished for. However, what will always \npersist is his ambitious pursuit of the improvement of U.S. minority rights. \nThe legacy of the first black president of the United States in domestic \npolitics is that of a pioneer in opening the door for many – but not all –\nAmericans who had to struggle with inequality, discrimination and disdain \nby major parts of the society. It will also be the fact that alienated his \nopponents even more strongly and contributed to a rising polarization.  \nSo what distinguished the minority politics of the Obama \nadministration? The explicit integration of minority interests into broader \nagendas was one point. During the financial crisis of 2008/2009, the policies \nimplemented were also supposed to benefit African-Americans in particular. \nFor instances, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) was \namong the measures to counter the spiral that drove the United States deeper \nand deeper into the financial crisis and also assured that almost 1.4 million \nAfrican Americans were kept out of poverty as a report of the Obama \nAdministration emphasized.292 Besides that, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act (2010), generally known as Obamacare, and its \namendment, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, \nwere also – albeit certainly not exclusively – supposed to diminish the \ndiscrepancy between the availability of health care for white and black \nAmericans. The Obama administration always thoughtfully integrated the \nspecial needs for the advancement of African-Americans. The Department \nof Justice Civil Rights Division continuously received slight increases of \ntheir budget.293 Also, the Community Development Financial Institutions \nBudget was increased with the intention to “finance community \n                                                 \n291 “Change we can believe in” was also Barack Obama’s slogan during the election \ncampaign in 2008. Even though, the rallying cry became “Yes, we can”.  \n292 “Obama Administration Record for the African American Community,” The White \nHouse, February 29, 2012, accessed November 9, 2016, \nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/african_american_community\n_record.pdf.  \n293 “FY 2016 Performance Budget Congressional Submission,” U.S. Department of Justice \n– Civil Rights Division, February 1, 2015, accessed November 9, 2016, \nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/pages/attachments/2015/02/01/14._civil_rig\nhts_division_crt.pdf.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    186 \n \ndevelopment projects in distressed areas” which can be predominantly \ndefined as city centers showing a majority of black poor inhabitants.294 \nAdditionally, conservatives were further alienated by Obama’s \nwillingness to pursue the spreading of minority rights by executive orders. \nWhen Obama started his first term as president of the United States his \nintention was to reform the U.S. immigration legislation. During his first \nyears in office Obama worked on passing the Development, Relief, and \nEducation for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. The essence of this bill was the \ngrant of a legal status to undocumented immigrants who entered the country \nunder the age of 16 – given that they fulfilled a variety of preconditions.295 \nHowever, the opposition by politicians of the Republican Party was \ntremendous and therefore passage of the bill was prevented. Instead, the \nObama administration successfully implemented the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (DACA) program by passing an executive order. The \nDACA was supposed to realize some major endeavors targeted by the \nDREAM Act. On the forefront were children who immigrated into the \nUnited States over the last years. The executive order pursued the strategy \nof deferred actions, meaning that immigrants, predominantly young adults \nages 15 to 30, who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, receive a \ntemporary reprieve from deportation and a two-year work permit to obtain a \nprofessional qualification.296 However, the Obama administration’s decision \nto pass an executive order was widely opposed by the Republicans which \nresulted in the symbolic decision to defund DACA by the House of \nRepresentatives in 2013; a decision that was overturned by the Democratic \ncontrolled Senate.297 Furthermore, the Obama administration set an end to \nthe Secure Communities Program that contributed to the arrest and \ndeportation of immigrants who committed minor offenses without \n                                                 \n294 “Obama Administration Record for the African American Community.”  \n295 “The Dream Act: Good for Our Economy, Good for Our Security, Good for our \nNation,” The White House, November 22, 2011, accessed November 10, 2016, \nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/DREAM-Act-WhiteHouse-\nFactSheet.pdf.  \n296 Mark Hugo Lopez and Jens Manuel Krogstad, “5 facts about the Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals program,” Pew Research Center, August 15, 2014, accessed November \n10, 2016, http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/08/15/5-facts-about-the-deferred-\naction-for-childhood-arrivals-program/.  \n297 Marcia Zug, “The Mirage of Immigration Reform: The Devastating Consequences of \nObama’s Immigration Policy,” Kansas Law Review, 2015, Vol. 63, Issue 4, 956. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    187 \n \nconviction. Instead, the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP), implemented \nin 2015, was supposed to prioritize the deportation of undocumented \nimmigrants depending on the severity of the crime committed.298 It is \nunquestionable that the implementations of the immigration programs also \nhad negative effects: Undocumented immigrants who came to the United \nStates after January 1, 2010 had almost no chance of staying in the country. \nAs a consequence, the numbers of deported immigrants rose drastically and \nreached record heights since the implementation of the DACA program.299 \nImmigrants who were waiting for deportation were locked up in detention \ncenters – adults and children alike. Human rights violations such as denial \nof food and medical care, lack of due process, and allegations of sexual \nassault were common.300 Despite these facts, conservatives’ perception of \nBarack Obama’s immigration policy is defined by a strong liberalism which, \nin parts, was actually its initial intention. However, the progressive ideas \nObama might have had, were corrupted by a legislation that responded to \nhis initiatives with rejection. Nevertheless, conservatives will always \nperceive Obama as a liberal president who was weak on undocumented \nimmigrants. \nHowever, the most significant point that distinguished President \nObama’s support for minorities was his rhetoric; his firm stance on specific \nminority rights and his announcements of these to the American people. \nBarack Obama was straight forward in responding to the civil unrest \nerupting after the killing of the African-American teenager Michael Brown \nand the acquittal of the shooter, the white police officer Darren Wilson. In \ncontrast to President George Bush Sen., whose response to the civil unrest \nin Los Angeles after the brutal beating of the African-American Rodney \nKing (1991) was evidence of his and the Republicans ignorance, Obama \n                                                 \n298 Jeh Johnson, “Priority Enforcement Program – How DHS is Focusing on Deporting \nFelons,” Homeland Security, July 30, 2015, accessed November 10, 2016, \nhttps://www.dhs.gov/blog/2015/07/30/priority-enforcement-program-%E2%80%93-how-\ndhs-focusing-deporting-felons.  \n299 Ana Gonzalez-Barrera and Jens Manuel Krogstad, “U.S. deportations of immigrants \nreach record high in 2013,” Pew Research Center, October 2, 2014, accessed November 10, \n2016, http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/02/u-s-deportations-of-immigrants-\nreach-record-high-in-2013/.  \n300 Sarah Lazare, “Hundreds of Women in Immigrant Prison on Hunger Strike for \nImmediate Release,” Common Dreams, November 3, 2015.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    188 \n \nunderstood the socio-political dimension behind the Ferguson Riots. He \ntook a stand on supporting the cause but not the violent tactics. Obama tried \nto de-escalate, but also to lay the foundation for progress – exactly as he did \nafter the killing of the 17-year old African-American Trayvon Martin in \nFlorida in 2012. His support for African-Americans was undeniably strong \nand was perceived accordingly by the conservative population. A research \npublished by the Pew Research Center in June 2016 shows the \ndissatisfaction of white Americans – especially Republicans. 32 percent of \nall white respondents stated that Obama had made race relations worse. \nAmong supporters of the Republican Party the share rose up to 63 percent \n(in contrast to five percent among Democrats). In addition, more than half \nof white Republicans (59 percent) interviewed said too much attention was \npaid to race and racial issues nowadays. The minority politics of the Obama \nadministration led to an obvious alienation of white conservatives. \nStill, the minority group Obama has been most supportive of over \nthe course of his presidency was actually the LGBTQ* community. Never \nbefore has the LGBTQ* community had such a persistent ally in the White \nHouse who was so determined to contribute his share to LGBTQ* equality. \nThe only president who was willing to initiate legislative measures to \nfacilitate gay rights before was President Bill Clinton who terribly failed, \nsince neither the U.S. citizens nor its politicians were progressive and open-\nminded enough to accept and promote a society distinguished by its \ndiversity in the 1990s. When Barack Obama ran for president in 2008 and \npledged to repeal Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, the LGBTQ* community might \nonly have slightly anticipated how central he would be as an ally in the \nWhite House. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was repealed in 2010, exactly as he had \npromised two years before, and in the subsequent year the Obama \nadministration decided to no longer back up the discriminatory Defense of \nMarriage Act in court and to propose a bill to Congress that was supposed \nto repeal DOMA. This decision was the pathway towards the U.S. Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Windsor v. United States in 2013 which declared Article \n3 unconstitutional. The Supreme Court’s decision defined that homosexual \ncouples who were married under state law had to receive the same benefits \nand protections as heterosexual couples did. Even prior to the ruling in \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    189 \n \nWindsor v. United States, Barack Obama affirmed his tie with the LGBTQ* \npeople when he stated in an ABC News Exclusive Interview that he \nsupports same-sex marriage. Even though Obama had still been hesitant on \nthe issue a few years before and the endorsement for the implementation of \ngay marriage came right before the presidential election in 2014, he proved \nhis commitment over the next years. The President was always on the \nforefront when the LGBTQ* community needed support, constantly \nreminding the U.S. people that the principle of equality, on which the nation \nwas founded, also applied to the LGBTQ* community. In 2009, Barack \nObama gave a speech at the Human Rights Campaign Dinner emphasizing \nthat he stood with every LGBTQ* in that fight and that he would assure the \npassing of a hate crime legislation.301 The Matthew Shepard and James \nByrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was signed into law the same month. \nIn 2011, Obama returned to the HRC Dinner and gave another speech, \nconfirming his persistence in the endeavor to spread equality and sending \nout the message that all Americans should be endowed with the same rights. \nBarack Obama’s support for the LGBTQ* community was unprecedented. \nThe LGBTQ* community quickly realized that they had an ally in Barack \nObama who would support their initiatives. The movement’s share had to be \nto continue their work of strategic litigation and lobbying and they even had \nto spread it. The movement had to reach out to the community as well as the \nU.S. people. They had to create awareness, construct a collective identity \nand gain energetic supporters and advocates for their cause. “The cause” \nwas more or less predefined due to the encouragement of the Obama \nadministration; it had to be the issues which can be categorized by the term \n“structural violence” – particularly same-sex marriage. As shown before, the \nLGBTQ* movement engaged more and more in social media activities \npursuing their goals of equality. Same-sex marriage became the core of their \nstruggle and their agents to promote it were diverse.  \nThe Obama administration’s support coincided with a strengthening \nof the LGBTQ* movement; and even more it contributed to its success.

The movement chose the right channels to \nreach millions of people and influence them – and simultaneously they \nbenefitted from the President’s allegiance. Yet, while the LGBTQ*’s social \nmedia movement was so enthusiastic about these advancements, they \nmissed the emergence of virtues and strategies that were threatening the \ncohesion and the success of the movement. Simultaneously to the \nconstitution of egotism as a threatening concept, an alienation of \nconservative and overwhelmed segments of society led to a major \npolarization of the U.S. people. Obama’s minority politics transformed the \nsocio-political landscape as much as the economic developments resulting \nfrom the rule of neoliberalism. While neoliberalism as well as President \nObama’s policies had undeniably positive effects on LGBTQ* rights they \nalso created sentiments that led the United States towards an isolated and \nreactionary existence. Among the outgrowths are polarized and irrational \npolitical actors. The American people is as divided as it has not been for \ndecades and the LGBTQ* communities are among those groups who will be \nsuffering from it.  \n \n \n2. The Future of the LGBTQ* Movement  \n \nCurrent political and social developments have been built up over a \ncertain period of time. Already in the aftermath of President Obama’s \ninauguration, a countermovement to the progressivism dominating domestic \npolitics emerged. The Tea Party movement, which was mostly supported by \nright-wing politicians of the Republican Party, dedicated itself to the \nimplementation of conservative goals. Originally, the Tea Party started as a \ngrassroots movement preoccupied with heralding an economic \nconservatism. The politicians representing the Tea Party movement on a \npolitical level have additionally adopted a populist rhetoric that completely \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    191 \n \nlacked strategies to implement their goals pragmatically.302 However, the \nTea Party Movement is not merely aligned with economic conservatism, but \nhas also stood for social conservatism over the course of their political \nactivism. Politicians like Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, Marco Rubio, \nand Ted Cruz, who sided with the Tea Party and became the face on a \nfederal level, hold tremendous social conservative beliefs. A Pew Research \nalso found that Tea Party supporters tend to have very conservative opinions \non social matters as well.303 Additionally, the Tea Party and the religious \nright are closely linked and the latter has explicit influences on views of \nsame-sex marriage and abortion as the survey showed. The Tea Party \nMovement was a manifestation of the attempt to give conservatives a place \nof belonging, to unite them in a movement that would bring change and that \nwould stir up the establishment. However, what the movement actually \naccomplished was the immense fractioning of the Republican Party.   \nThe polarization within the political and social landscape which has \nbeen illuminated before was spread even more and additionally \naccompanied by the expansion of a harsh and hateful rhetoric. Especially \nthe Tucson shooting in 2011, in which the Democratic Representative \nGabrielle Giffords barely survived an assassination attempt and six other \npeople were wounded, gave rise to criticism of the evolving hateful \nenvironment in the United States. Nevertheless, the socio-political climate \neven aggravated and reached its momentum during the last two years of the \nObama presidency. The candidacy of Donald J. Trump has changed the \npolitical discourse. Trump, a man without any political experience, fought \nan election campaign that was unprecedented. His campaign as well as the \nnomination and election process was characterized by hate, contempt of \nminorities and women and the attempt to set groups against each other. The \nradicalism he has stirred divided the nation to a degree that has not been \n                                                 \n302 For instances, the Tea Party Patriots organization’s major ambition is, according to their \nown definition, the conservation of the American Dream and the creation of the economic \nbasis that helps to achieve it. The Tea Party Patriots have adopted a traditional, narrow \nagenda that concentrates on the limitation of federal power, tax cuts and “fiscal \nresponsibility”.

Women, immigrants, African-Americans, \nand disabled people were humiliated and verbally harassed. Since the \nelection of Donald Trump, minorities fear for their rights in the United \nStates. The Republican Party was shaken as well as the American people. \nDonald Trump appealed to all those who were dissatisfied with the politics \nof the past years. 78 percent of his supporters claimed that a continuation of \nthe Obama politics under a potential Clinton administration would be a “bad \nthing”.304 On top of the rejection of Obama’s economic policies, \nRepublicans and Republican leaners disproportionally do not perceive \ndiscrimination against racial minorities, immigrants, Muslims, women or \nLGBTQ*s. Additionally, they are also disproportionally sure that no further \nprogress is needed in e.g. racial equality.305 The irrational striving for a \ndefeat of the political establishment, for which Hillary Clinton was one of \nthe most distinguished representatives, led to the election of a radical \npopulist. The voters’ decision for opposing the established politicians must \nbe associated with an insufficient knowledge of the political system. The \nelection of the U.S. president will never bring a total change to the political \nsystem and will never extinguish the establishment because the legislative \nbody always consists of people that are part of the so-called establishment \nwith whom the executive branch will have to cooperate. Eventually, the \nlaws passed and the decisions made are those approved and supported by \nthe legislative branch – the “establishment”.  \nThe decision-making power of the executive branch is limited but \nstill, its rhetoric and its symbolism are influential. The cabinet which \nDonald Trump appointed does not only have prominence for a strong focus \non economic politics it is also infamous for its conservative values and \nespecially its anti-LGBTQ* stance as well as its ignorance regarding \nminority politics. Donald Trump’s cabinet does not include a single \nLGBTQ* ally. On the contrary – among its members are politicians that \nbelong to the most dedicated anti-LGBTQ* politicians in the United States. \n                                                 \n304 “Clinton, Trump Supporters Have Starkly Different Views of a Changing Nation,” Pew \nResearch Center, August 18, 2016, accessed December 21, 2016, http://www.people-\npress.org/2016/08/18/clinton-trump-supporters-have-starkly-different-views-of-a-changing-\nnation/.  \n305 Ibid. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    193 \n \nThe Attorney General Jeff Sessions has casted votes against every single bill \nbenefiting LGBTQ* people. He not only voted to ban same-sex marriage by \nan amendment to the U.S. constitution but also co-sponsored the First \nAmendment Defense Act that would guarantee the right to discriminate \nagainst LGBTQ*s on grounds of religious beliefs. The essence of the bill \nsays that the act would: \n \nProhibit the federal government from taking discriminatory action \nagainst a person on the basis that such person believes or acts in \naccordance with a religious belief or moral conviction that: (1) \nmarriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one \nwoman, or (2) sexual relations are properly reserved to such a \nmarriage.306 \n \nThe First Amendment Defense Act would enshrine another piece of \ndiscriminatory practice into law and thereby constitute itself as part of a \nstructure that would contribute to ostracizing LGBTQ* people. If passed by \nCongress, Donald Trump has already promised to sign the bill into law.307 \nAdditionally, Sessions opposes the inclusion of LGBTQ* people as a \nvulnerable group into U.S. hate crime legislations.308 However, the Attorney \nGeneral has to sign off on federal hate crime prosecutions, which makes it \nvery likely that over the course of the Trump administration no crimes will \nbe prosecuted as federal hate crimes. This weakens the fight against hate \ncrimes and violence tremendously.  \nBut not only the office of the Attorney General is held by a \ncommitted anti-LGBTQ* official, also Tom Price, Trump’s initial Secretary \nof Health and Human Services309, has a clear standing that opposes gay as \nwell as transsexual rights.

While the Attorney General is essential for the protection of \nminority rights, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the \nresponsibility to ensure the funding of anti-HIV researches – a topic that is \nespecially significant for the LGBTQ* community. Donald Trump \nendangered these major topics by appointing Price. \nHowever, the number of anti-LGBTQ* politicians within the cabinet \nwas even higher: Betsy DeVos, a billionaire who has been the chair of the \nWindquest Group, an investment management firm, and has been appointed \nSecretary of Education has previously funded organizations that are \ncommitted to restricting LGBTQ* rights.310 Among those was the group \nFocus on the Family, a conservative Christian group that supports \nconversion therapy.311  \nJames Mattis, the former four-star general who served in the U.S. \nMarine Corps from 1969 to 2013 and was appointed as Secretary of Defense \nhas openly opposed the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. In his confirmation \nhearing as Secretary of Defense, Mattis avoided any clear positioning when \nhe was questioned by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on his stance on LGBTQ* \npeople serving in the U.S. military.  \nApart from the ministers that have the ability to impact LGBTQ* \nrights directly, the remaining cabinet also has a strong anti-LGBTQ* \nstanding. Ben Carson, Rick Perry, Elaine Chao, Wilbur Ross as well as \nTrump’s initial Chief of Staff Reince Priebus312 – they all have a history of \nsupporting anti-LGBTQ* legislations and voicing disapproval and contempt \nfor homosexuality.  \n                                                 \n310 Benjamin Wermund and Kimberly Hefling, “Trump’s education secretary pick \nsupported anti-gay causes,” POLITICO, November 25, 2016, accessed January 15, 2017, \nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/betsy-devos-education-secretary-civil-rights-gay-\ntransgender-students-231837.  \n311 Conversion therapy rests on the belief that a person’s “abnormal” sexual orientation can \nbe adjusted by providing psychological treatment or spiritual counseling. The result is \nsupposed to be the conversion of a homosexual or bisexual orientation into a heterosexual \none. In the past (predominantly before the 1980s), aversive treatments like electro-shock \ntherapy or chemical castration with hormonal treatment and ice pick lobotomies were used \nwith the intention to adjust ones sexual orientation. More on conversion therapies: Garnets, \nLinda and Douglas Kimmel, ed. Psychological Perspectives on Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual \nExperiences. New York: Columbia University Press, 2002. \n312 Priebus was replaced by John F. Kelly in July 2017. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    195 \n \nVice-President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, has not only \nvoted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, the repeal of Don’t \nAsk, Don’t Tell and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act but has also signed a Religious Freedom Restoration Act \nduring his term as Governor of Indiana. Furthermore, Pence has a record of \nsupporting conversion therapy even though his current attitude on this \nprocedure is not clear. Moreover, the close alignment of Donald Trump with \nhis key advisor and strategist Stephen Bannon over the course of the \nelection process and the first days in office was alarming. Bannon has \nformerly been the executive chair of the far-right online magazine Breitbart \nNews, a website that is well-known for its extremist conservative, right-\nwing opinions that fuels hate against immigrants, minority groups and \nliberals. Even though Trump has distanced himself from Bannon which \nbecame especially apparent when the strategist was removed from the \nSecurity Council in 2017 and ultimately also in 2018 when Trump openly \nbroke with Bannon, his cabinet choices and the selection of his closest \nadvisors have already exposed right after his election that LGBTQ* equality \nwill be under threat for the next years. The election in 2016 has also secured \nthe Republican Party a solid majority in the House of Representatives as \nwell as in the Senate. During – at least – the first two years of the Trump \nadministration, anti-LGBTQ* bills can easily be passed while it is unlikely \nthat equality bills will be enacted. The threat that anti-LGBTQ* bills will be \nimplemented is imminent. It is expected that anti-LGBTQ* bills which have \nbeen introduced into state’s legislations and in the U.S. Congress on a \nregular basis will be actually passed over the next years. A potential \nimplementation of the First Amendment Defense Act on the federal level \nmight be a threat to LGBTQ* equality as well as bathroom bills to \ntransgender rights. In addition, the passage of the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Bill, which has been introduced into each Congress since \n1994, will recede into the distance. In fact, the first 100 days of Donald \nTrump as President of the United States have already set the agenda for \nminority politics.  \nExecutive Order 13769, titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign \nTerrorist Entry into the United States that was signed on January 27, 2017, \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    196 \n \nbanned citizens from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \nfrom immigrating into and/or entering the United States. This order (and \nthose to follow) already pointed towards Donald Trump and his \nadministration’s position on minority and human rights. The opposition that \nemerged after the introduction of the executive order clearly depicted the \ncommitment of liberal Americans to defy the U.S. government and its \nconservative and reactionary legislations. The election of Donald Trump has \nrevitalized liberal protest movements in the United States – and also \nworldwide. The Women’s March which was organized a day after Donald \nTrump’s inauguration in Washington D.C. as well as in major cities of all \nseven continents was in response to the hateful rhetoric Donald Trump \nutilized in his election campaign. The movement is dedicated to equality, \ndiversity and inclusion and the spreading of the understanding of women’s \nrights as human rights.313 It envisions itself as a progressive movement. The \nmagnitude of the marches worldwide was impressive and it symbolized the \ndesire of millions of people to counter the populist, anti-democratic and \npaternalistic developments. The protesters carried their fight to the streets \nand deployed a long-standing tradition that has become a symbol of the \npower of the people: A march on Washington. Multiple times revolutions \ngrew in strength and influence on the streets of Washington D.C. These \nstreets have stirred the Civil Rights Movement, the Women’s Rights \nMovement and the Anti-War Movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s. \nThis time, in 2017, the March on Washington was in opposition to \nconservatives and their values, vestiges of the past and inhuman rhetoric. It \nwas the embracement of diversity and globalism.  \nThe progressives in the United States benefit from highly motivated \nsupporters and plenty of resources constituting the foundation to oppose the \ndevelopments that might evolve over the next years. Gay rights \norganizations were among those that quickly started campaigns to affront \nany anti-LGBTQ* activities. The Human Rights Campaign initiated an \nonline study a month after the election of Donald Trump. The organization \ntried to retrieve a synopsis of the election’s effects on U.S. adolescences \n                                                 \n313 “Women's March Global,” Women’s March on Washington, accessed April 14, 2017, \nhttps://www.womensmarch.com/global/. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    197 \n \nbetween 13 and 18 years. Even though the survey is not representative it \nprovides a clear indication which impact the current political situation had \non young people belonging to minority groups. Of the 50,619 respondents, \n70 percent reported witnessing bullying, hate messages or harassment \nduring or since the 2016 election. Among young people who reported seeing \nbullying and harassment, 70 percent had seen incidents motivated by race or \nethnicity, 63 percent had observed incidents motivated by sexual \norientation, 59 percent had witnessed incidents motivated by immigration \nstatus, and 55 percent had seen incidents motivated by gender.314 Although \nit must be considered that respondents have become more sensitive about \noccurrences of bullying and harassment in the aftermath of the election, the \nstudy nonetheless shows that the socio-political situation has become tenser \nand affects minorities’ minds. The Human Rights Campaign already tried to \nraise awareness to these developments and to create the foundation for more \nwide-spread actions against anti-LGBTQ* politicians and activists in early \n2017.  \nIt was also the Human Rights Campaign that has started to post \nphotographs and charts of Donald Trump’s cabinet nominees (and later \nsecretaries) and their anti-LGBTQ* and anti-minority reputations since \nTrump had announced the candidates.  \n \n \n                                                 \n314 “Human Rights Campaign Post-Election Survey of Youth,” Human Rights Campaign, \nJanuary 18, 2017, accessed January 20, 2017, http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-\n1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/HRC_PostElectionSurveyofYouth.pdf.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    198 \n \nFurthermore, videos have been uploaded on YouTube that expose the \ncabinet member’s anti-LGBTQ* record. The Human Rights Campaign has \nadditionally published leaflets delineating the anti-LGBTQ* positions of the \ncabinet members. In January 2017, the activists uploaded a pamphlet \nheadlining “JEFF SESSIONS: A HISTORY OF ANTI-LGBTQ \nACTIONS”.315 It exposes the Attorney General’s positions on LGBTQ* \nrights and includes an open letter written by Judy Shepard, the mother of the \nmurdered Matthew Shepard. Judy Shepard has been an active promoter of \nLGBTQ* rights and has – as mentioned before – contributed particularly to \nthe implementation of the federal hate crime law which was opposed by Jeff \nSessions. On July 20, 2009 the former Senator held a long speech against \nthe Matthew Shepard and James L. Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act and \nthe pamphlet cites one of his most distinctive exclamations:  \n \nInstead of administering justice without fear or favor, this legislation \nthat has been placed on this bill creates a new system of justice for \nindividuals because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, \nproviding them with a special protection, while excluding vulnerable \nindividuals, such as the elderly or police officers or soldiers, from \nsuch special protections. I don't think we can justify that.316 \n \nThis statement among others strongly offended LGBTQ* people and \nbecame valuable in the activist’s attempts to create a cohesion among the \nmovement’s participants in its struggle against the challenges that arose \nwith the election of Donald Trump and the Republican dominated U.S. \nCongress. Images like the ones above that show the cabinet’s negative \nrecord on LGBTQ* rights are supposed to raise awareness and illuminate \nwhat might result from the current political developments. Not only the \nHuman Rights Campaign but also GLAAD has started to post similar photos \non social media.

GLAAD \nalso continued this kind of rhetoric after Trump’s inauguration. The newest \nslogan titles TOGETHER#WeResist and is followed by the exclamation \n“LGBTQ people under attack” and a clock counting the days Donald Trump \nis in office. \nHowever, will these measures be sufficient to confront social-\nconservative and reactionary legislation that lay ahead? It stands to reason \nthat the Trump administration will promote structural violence even if the \nnumber of bills intending to restrict LGBTQ* equality stays limited. The \nfact that such persistent opponents of minority rights are in possession of the \nexecutive power is a manifestation of the continued existence of structural \nviolence against LGBTQ*.

The progress \nwill stagnate and instead a backlash is likely to unfold its power.  \nThe first 100 days of Donald Trump have shown that his strategy of \npromoting legislative pieces harmful to LGBTQ* rights is subtle. On \nJanuary 31, 2017, the White House published a press release assuring \nLGBTQ* people that Donald Trump would not reverse Executive Order \n11246 which was amended by Barack Obama’s Executive Order 13672. \nAfter Obama’s amendment Executive Order 11246 prohibited “federal \ncontractors and federally–assisted construction contractors and \nsubcontractors, who did over $10,000 in Government business in one year \nfrom discriminating in employment decisions on the basis of race, color, \nreligion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.”318 As \ndiscussed in the chapter on workplace discrimination, this executive order is \nthe single federal regulation that protects LGBTQ* workers slightly. \nHowever, only two months later on March 27, 2017, Trump enforced the \nPresidential Executive Order on the Revocation of Federal Contracting \nExecutive Orders. Section 1 revoked Obama’s amendment that prohibited \nsexual orientation and gender identity discrimination for federal \ncontractors.319 The enforcement of Trump’s executive order was done \nsilently and there was a clear intention to avoid attracting too much \nattention. Interestingly, his strategy was successful. The major gay rights \norganizations hardly covered news on Trump’s order; instead they remained \nsurprisingly passive.  \nIt might be that the gay rights organizations like GLAAD and the \nHuman Rights Campaign were preoccupied with the developments that \nevolved the following day. On March 28, 2017, the criterions for the Census \n2020 were released and it became apparent that sexual orientation and \ngender identity will be erased from the survey.

This is well-illustrated by his press statement in January 2017 \nwhen he reassured the community to enforce LGBTQ workplace protection:  \n \nPresident Donald J. Trump is determined to protect the rights of all \nAmericans, including the LGBTQ community. President Trump \ncontinues to be respectful and supportive of LGBTQ rights, just as he \nwas throughout the election. The President is proud to have been the \nfirst ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his \nnomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the \ncommunity from violence and oppression.324 \n \nDonald Trump seems to perceive his stance on LGBTQ* rights as liberal \nand progressive. He perceives the United States as a place in which \ndiscrimination and violence against LGBTQ*s is only exercised by Islamic \nterrorists and immigrants. He ignores the fact that U.S. citizens are also \namong the perpetrators and that the political system has not eliminated \n                                                 \n324 “Presidential Executive Order on the Revocation of Federal Contracting Executive \nOrders,” The White House, accessed April 14, 2017, https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-\npress-office/2017/03/27/presidential-executive-order-revocation-federal-contracting-\nexecutive.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    204 \n \ndiscrimination and structural violence against LGBTQ*s. He does not \ncomprehend that social concepts like heteronormativity are still established \nand threaten the well-being of LGBTQ* people. Moreover, neither Trump \nnor Republican voters, nor Trump’s cabinet members see the requisiteness \nto initiate further steps to assure equality. A Pew Research from October \n2016 clearly indicated that 71 percent of Republicans and Republican \nLeaners favor that shop owners of wedding services are able to refuse to \nserve gay or lesbian couples. In addition, 67 percent of people identifying as \nRepublican insist that transgender people use the restroom for the gender \nthey were born into – even if the current appearance does not fit this \ngender.325 These beliefs clearly show that there is a lack of understanding \nand ignorance for the consequences of these attitudes that get manifested in \nsociety’s structure. On the day of Donald Trump’s inauguration all \nLGBTQ*-related pages of the White House website were archived and not \nreplaced by any statement by Donald Trump or the new administration. \nEven though this did not come as a surprise it is symbolic for the new era \nunder Donald Trump. LGBTQ* rights are not part of the Republican \nagenda. The decision to erase the categories of gender identity and sexual \norientation from the Census 2020 has probably not been out of viciousness \nbut out of ignorance and the belief that the level of equality already reached \nby LGBTQ*s is sufficient; that it is no longer necessary to pay particular \nattention to these categories since the progress of the last years has been \nerasing all grievances. This ignorance combined with the firm anti-\nLGBTQ* attitude of many cabinet members is threatening the community. \nThe circumstance that Neil M. Gorsuch has become the newest member of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court is not reassuring. Gorsuch has a record of \nconservative rulings and is closely aligned with religious groups. He will \nprobably be serving the court for the next decades and liberal votes from his \nside can hardly be expected.  \nThe next years will bring a backlash against LGBTQ* rights – may it \nbe intended or unintended.

An impeachment of Donald \nTrump can not be ruled out. He, himself as well as the virtues he stands for \nare too controversial to predict if Donald Trump will remain in office for the \nfull term. However, an administration led by Mike Pence would indeed be a \nmajor threat that could even lead to an aggravation of the situation for \nLGBTQ* people. Either way, the consequences LGBTQ*s will suffer from \nover the course of the next years will include an impairment of their mental \nand/or physical well-being. On March 29, 2017 the new administration sent \nits budget for the fiscal year 2017 to Congress and indicated that the \nDepartment of Defense will receive an increase in 54 billion US Dollar. \nTherefore, the budget for the health department will be cut dramatically. It \nis expected that 1.2 billion US Dollar will be cut from the National Institutes \nof Health, 50 million US Dollar from CDC HIV research and prevention \nprograms and nearly 300 million US Dollar from the global HIV and AIDS \ntreatment through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief \n(PEPFAR).326 It is this ignorance that threatens lives; the spirit of egotism \nthat leads to the ignorance of the well-being of other people. Neoliberalism \nhas not promoted human rights; instead it has given rise to a society that \noften lacks the ability empathize. Donald Trump is the embodiment of the \nneoliberal nature and combines its virtues. Moral reasoning is unbeknownst \nto him.  \n \nSo, how can the LGBTQ* community and particularly the major gay \nrights organizations confront this force of anti-LGBTQ* politicians and the \nspirit of egotism and ignorance; an egotism and ignorance that does not only \npenetrate the heteronormative society but also the LGBTQ* movement \nitself? The initial activism against Donald Trump and his administration was \npromising but the first 100 days have shown that the Trump administrations’ \nstrategy to cut back LGBTQ* rights and to subvert homosexuals’, bisexuals’ \nand transgenders’ visibility are challenging.

Donald Trump’s social media \nactivism as well as his press secretaries’ and advisors’ public performances \ntake up much space and distract the public’s attention.  \nThe reign of social media has heralded an era in which fake news \nand populist messages can be quickly and efficiently distributed. Donald \nTrump has mastered the strategies to play this game. This development has \nbeen defined as the rise of post-truth politics over the last months. The \nconcept of “post-truth politics” was already introduced by the writer Ralph \nKeyes in 2004 but has not come to much prominence until the year 2016. \nSince then the expression has undergone an impressive rise of usage. It \nwould be naïve to believe that post-truth politics represent a new \ndevelopment. History has seen the exploitation of lies and half-truths by \npoliticians. What has changed is that the distribution of these lies has \nbecome easier and more difficult to penetrate due to the rise of social media. \nDonald Trump has understood the potential of social media and has proven \nto be the pioneer, the one who demonstrated the successfulness of spreading \npopulist politics via social media. It has been his advisor Kellyanne Conway \nwho has created the term “alternative facts” and depicted it as a true \nconstruct.  \nThe propagation of superficial and incomplete knowledge, the \nexpansion of incorrect information, the tendency to consume only selected \nnews sources, or even exclusively social media posts, is a threat to the \nheritage of the enlightenment Western societies have gone through in the \n18th and 19th century. Additionally, it has become a threat to all minorities. \nManipulation can be easily achieved via social media networks and might \neven be driven by political players.327  \nMoreover, there have already been attempts to set minorities against \neach other. The Pulse shooting is probably the best example. Donald Trump \nhimself played the terrorism card and thereby tried to appeal to a construct \n                                                 \n327 Cambridge Analytica, a company that applies “behavioral microtargeting” on social \nplatforms has worked for Trump’s election campaign and might have manipulated the \ndistribution of information according to the user’s specific profile. However the impact of \nthe company’s work remains uncertain. More on that: Hannes Grassegger and Mikael \nKrogerus, “Ich habe nur gezeigt, dass es die Bombe gibt,” Das Magazine, December 3, \n2016, accessed December 21, 2016, https://www.dasmagazin.ch/2016/12/03/ich-habe-nur-\ngezeigt-dass-es-die-bombe-gibt/.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    207 \n \nthat is called homonationalism. The term was introduced by the gender \nstudies researcher Jasbir K. Puar in his book “Terrorist Assemblages” \n(2007). The concept attempts to explain why LGBTQ* people gather around \nthe nationalistic views of the far-right, the politics of which are also targeted \nagainst LGBTQ*s themselves; a behavior that seems to be contradictory but \ntraces back to the fear of some LGBTQ*s of immigrants – especially \nMuslim immigrants – assuming that these will be threatening gay rights and \nsexual diversity. In times of populism, homonationalism also becomes a \nperil for the cohesion of the LGBTQ* movement. The Pulse shooting has \nshown that the movement additionally has to confront and thwart the rising \npaternalistic behavior of white heterosexuals who depict themselves as \nopen-minded and accepting but are instead driven by ignorance and a sense \nof egotism. People who were allegedly mourning the death of the 49 victims \nand called the shooting an act of terror lack basic understanding of the \ndeeper meaning of the occurrences. Omar Mateen might have sworn his \nallegiance to ISIL but the hate for LGBTQ* people has been fed to him – at \nleast partially – in the United States. In 1986, Mateen was born in New \nHyde Park, New York to Afghan parents. He was raised in the United States \nin a moderate Muslim family. ISIL preaches predominantly hate against \ndisbelievers, namely those who are not believing in the religion of Islam, the \nradical interpretation of the Qur'an and the shariah. Even though \nhomosexuality is supposed to be punished with death in the view of radical \nIslamists, an attack on any ordinary American would have served Mateen’s \nintention. Yet he chose a gay bar. The real motivation for his choice will \nnever be unfolded but what persists is the circumstance that it is not \nsufficient to reduce the shooting to an act of terror. The people who died \nwere LGBTQ*s and their allies. Whether Mateen’s hate against LGBTQ* \npeople was stirred by radical Islamism or the heteronormative society or \neven both, either way or another, the act was a hate crime. It was an act that \nhas shown that the methods to face direct violence have to be adapted and \nthat new threats have joined the persisting ones. Some members of the \nLGBTQ* community might anticipate an increased level of violence they \nmight be confronted with. People like Donald Trump even try to stir this \nfear and abuse it for their political cause. Homonationalism and the rise of \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    208 \n \nIslamic fear additionally jeopardize the cohesion of the community. The \ncurrent socio-political developments expose LGBTQ* people to a variety of \nthreats and increase the danger of fractioning.  \nThe Pulse shooting has also uncovered an additional challenge \nimposed by the use of social media for LGBTQ* activism: fake news and \nhoaxes. Soon after the first accounts of the shooting and the offender were \nreleased, rumors started spreading that Omar Mateen was well known \namong many patrons in Pulse. Several witnesses reported independently of \none another that Mateen had been a regular visitor at the gay club. In \naddition, a couple of men claimed that they had been in contact with Mateen \nvia the gay dating apps Grindr, Jack’d and Adam4Adam.328 Mateen’s ex-\nwife was quoted to be certain that Mateen was gay and that his father had \nteased him for his allegedly feminine behavior. Furthermore, a Latin-\nAmerican man reached out to the media and declared that he had had a \nsexual relationship with Omar Mateen for several months prior to the \nshooting. The man, who wanted to remain anonymous and called himself \nMiguel, stated that he had had sexual intercourse with Mateen more than 20 \ntimes and that they had always met in a hotel room. In his opinion, the \nattack on Pulse was an act of revenge as Mateen feared to have conceived \nHIV329 from a gay Puerto Rican.330 Miguel’s credibility was immediately \ndoubted by major U.S. newspapers and the doubts were confirmed by the \nFBI which has found no evidence that Omar Mateen had had a sexual \nrelationship with another man.331 In addition, the Washington Post \nquestioned the reliability of Univision, the American Spanish language \nbroadcast television network that broadcasted the interview with Miguel and \n                                                 \n328 Molly Hennessy-Fiske, “FBI investigators say they have found no evidence that Orlando \nshooter had gay lovers,” Los Angeles Times, June 23, 2016, accessed October 8, 2016, \nhttp://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-orlando-gay-fbi-20160623-snap-story.html. \n329 According to the FBI, the autopsy showed that Omar Mateen was HIV-negative. \n330 Joe Tacopino, “Omar Mateen’s gay lover says attack was ‘revenge’ for HIV-positive \nhookup,” New York Post, June 22, 2016, accessed October 8, 2016, \nhttp://nypost.com/2016/06/22/omar-mateens-alleged-gay-lover-claims-he-hated-puerto-\nricans/.  \n331 Hennessy-Fiske, “FBI investigators say they have found no evidence that Orlando \nshooter had gay lovers.”  \n \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    209 \n \nthat usually only provides entertainment broadcasts.332 In addition, the \nInternet blog ABC news published an article in which they hinted that \nMateen’s last text message to his wife stated: “I’m Gay, That’s Why I’m \nDoing This.”333 The article was unexposed as a hoax but it illuminates that \nthe social media landscape constructs a system difficult to penetrate. The \nInternet and social media pose a major challenge; the objectiveness and \ncredibility of media outlets become more difficult to determine. The \nselectivity of consumers of social media platforms and Internet users poses a \nperil to an open and target-oriented discourse as extremism can easily be \nfostered and stir emotions that prevent dialogues between opposing \nfractions. Misinformation and misrepresentation can influence masses and \nspark reactions corresponding to a political or ideological player’s intention. \nChoosing only one source of information will automatically result in \nincompleteness and the quantity of one-sided information can easily \nstimulate polarization and radicalism. Instead of applying selective \nbehaviors consumers must be committed to question any social media \ncontent and reflect on its essence. But how can billions of social media \nconsumers be persuaded to become responsible actors in the sphere of social \nmedia? The presidency of Donald Trump will definitely not bring reforms \nthat will result in a responsible and cautious utilization of social media by \nthe common Internet user. Therefore, the challenges for the LGBTQ* \nmovement will be dominated by the development of measures to counter the \nradicalization of the rhetoric on social media platforms, the rise of \ncommitted anti-LGBTQ* politicians to public office and the containment of \nthe spirit of egotism and ignorance. And it especially has to face the \nchallenge of ensuring the cohesion of the LGBTQ* movement.  \nA potential tool to preserve its cohesion, stimulate its diversity and \nto raise awareness despite the radical rhetoric on social media platforms \nmight lie in the violence triangle. Embracing the violence triangle would \n                                                 \n332 Erik Wemple, “Univision exclusive on Omar Mateen’s secret gay life comes under fire,” \nThe Washington Post, June 24, 2016, accessed October 8, 2016, \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/06/24/univision-exclusive-\non-omar-mateens-secret-gay-life-comes-under-fire/?utm_term=.beebe44cf949.  \n333 Jimmy Rustling, “Omar Mateen’s Final Text To Wife Released: I’m Gay, That’s Why \nI’m Doing This,” ABC News, November 10, 2016, accessed December 15, 2016, \nhttp://abcnews.com.co/omar-mateens-final-text-to-wife-released-im-gay/.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    210 \n \nlead to a broadening of the movement and a higher degree of inclusiveness. \nThose who currently often feel abandoned by the movement, who do not \nreceive the degree of support, they are in need of to improve their situation – \nthose might be integrated into the collective. The violence triangle can \nspread the knowledge about the interdependency of the different \nmanifestations of violence. Only if all three branches of the triangle are \npermanently targeted with the same intensity, unequal structures and \nviolence will be subverted. As shown before, the abandonment of direct \nviolence has led to despair among those who have been targeted. Pulse has \nadditionally revealed that the fear of direct violence and the desolation \nresulting from the inner knowledge that it has not been adequately \nconfronted yet, is immanent for each individual LGBTQ* person. Pulse \nexposed each LGBTQ*’s vulnerability and it stirred a fear that is often \nsuppressed by oneself. The reactions after the shooting revealed the \nhopelessness of the community and they have also exposed the peril of \nradicalization of LGBTQ* people. The shock and the helplessness resulted \nin harsh words and a tendency towards isolating oneself. Posts like the one \nby @EffyDxn show the encapsulation one can go through.334  \n \nElyssa Edwards, who is the person behind the user name EffyDxn, named \nthe cultural violence that results from the rule of heteronormativity. \nHowever, simultaneously her post transfers feelings of despair and \n                                                 \n334 Elyssa Edwards, Twitter post, June 15, 2016, 10:48 a.m., \nhttps://twitter.com/EffyDxn/media. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    211 \n \nallegations. This reaction is legitimate as a first response to the Pulse \nshooting while shock and sorrow dominate emotions. Yet it must be \nprevented that these feelings remain at the forefront of one’s mind. The \nLGBTQ* movement, under the leadership of the most influential gay rights \norganizations like the Human Rights Campaign and GLAAD, has to \nintegrate direct violence into their social media activism more strongly – \notherwise the rapture of the movement as well as the alienation of major \nparts of U.S. society will continue. In addition, they have to engage in a \ndebate of major manifestations of structural violence that have been \nneglected so far; neglected, because they did not affect the majority of the \ncommunity. Homeless kids and teenagers need the support of the whole \ncommunity. The LGBTQ* community can not criticize the heteronormative \nsociety’s ignorance and malice while not scrutinizing their own strategies. It \nis not exclusively on heterosexual conservatives or people who do not \nquestion the heteronormative system and their deeply-rooted sense of \negotism and ignorance; it is also on LGBTQ* activists to disclose the flaws \nof their movement and to counteract negative developments. The neglect of \nminorities and victims of direct violence are among these challenges that \nmust be countered by the community. They have to be confronted if the \nLGBTQ* movement intends to succeed in their struggle for the elimination \nof all factors affecting the well-being of LGBTQ*s. The persistence of the \nvirtue of egotism within the community threatens the movement as much as \nthe opposition of conservatives fighting LGBTQ* rights. The gay rights \norganizations have to lead the way; they have to structure the movement \nefficiently and work inclusively. Otherwise, not only the lives of individuals \nare on the line but also the cohesion of the broader movement.  \nThe neglect of direct violence in social media activism will lead to \nthe inability to realize the major goals of the movement. Equality will only \nbe of value if LGBTQ*s are able to be themselves in the public sphere \nwithout being a potential target. The neoliberal society feeds us with a \nstrong affection towards egotism and ignorance. To some extent, \nparticipating in the LGBTQ* movement serves exactly these virtues. \nLGBTQ* people profit from the successes achieved; it is what forces them \nto engage and join the movement. This can be utilized and adapted to the \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    212 \n \npreexisting conditions. It will not be feasible to change the climate of \negotism near-term. Instead, the solution to the challenges the movement is \nfacing might be that social media actors must be forced into expanding their \nactivity of self-staging. Potential activists must be convinced that supporting \nthe course of fighting all manifestations of LGBTQ* violence benefits the \nindividual as well. The violence triangle is the tool of persuasion and the \nindividual’s longing for self-staging the catalyst that convinces individuals \nto engage in social media activism. The movement has to stimulate more of \nthe feelings they are already approaching. It is not sufficient to confide in \nthe empathy of social media users since only a small minority will react on \nthis and engage in activism. Instead it will be necessary to nurse such \nfeelings like the desire for self-staging; the yearning for attention and likes. \nThis strategy might activate new sources and new advocates. The LGBTQ* \nmovement has to continue and even spread their strategy of staging the fate \nof individuals. Combined with the adaption of the violence triangle social \nmedia users can be fed with the direct linkage to their own fate and act on \ntheir desire of self-staging. The goal must not be the achievement of \nuniformity of LGBTQ* activists. The movement must instead strive for the \ninclusion of diversity and integrate as many different LGBTQ* activists as \npossible. The violence triangle will demonstrate the connection between \ndifferent manifestations of violence and expose the implicit advantages each \nindividual will profit from – no matter how different they are from each \nother.  \nRaising awareness for direct violence will result in legislative actions \nthat might impact society. Hate crime legislations are symbolic for the \nsupport of the administrative body, for the inexcusability of hate. They \nsubvert the heteronormativity, since they indicate that irrespective of ones \ngender or sexual orientation335 a person’s physical and mental integrity must \nnot be harmed. And by integrating direct violence or spheres of structural \nviolence often not debated, it additionally might be mediated that the \ncollective is the movement’s strength and power each individual LGBTQ* \ncan profit from.  \n                                                 \n335 Additionally, most hate crime laws include race, ethnicity/national origin, religion, sex \nand disabilities.  \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    213 \n \nWhat is currently missing is that the LGBTQ* movement uses the \nexpressions of cultural, structural and direct violence. There is an essential \nneed to explain the violence triangle to the movement’s activists themselves \nas well as to the society in general. Facing and discussing the violence \ntriangle would result in each individual LGBTQ*’s realization of the \nimportance to embrace direct violence and implement it into the \nmovement’s strategy. And it would also expose the more deeply rooted \nstructural violence. \nThe application of the violence triangle as a tool of social media \nactivism has the power to strengthen the LGBTQ* movement. The \ninterrelationship of cultural, structural and direct violence must be the \nfoundation of a new activism. Delineating the interrelationship exposes the \nneed to approach all manifestations of violence and not exclusively the one \nthat affects oneself. The justification of unequal structures and acts of \ndiscrimination is directly linked to the tolerance of direct violence. All three \nforms of violence are interrelated and fighting one serves the deconstruction \nof the foundations for the other categories.  \nIt would be naive to believe that, if structural violence got \neliminated, direct violence would automatically be eradicated as well. The \nintention of the violence triangle was to destruct one form of violence and \ndirectly impact the others. The deconstruction of cultural violence will \nbenefit the fight against direct and structural violence but it will not \ncompletely eradicate both forms. The process of eradication of violence will \nnever be fully completed. Violence will always remain a tool for \nsubordination and for the demonstration of power. Therefore, humans will \nalways thrive for the exercise of violence. Peace is an illusion that will – \nonce temporarily reached – eventually always constitute a transition period \nbetween conflicts. However, the violence triangle must be a representative \ntool that serves the movement for emphasizing inequality. It can stimulate \nthe discourse and shift the focus on the negative impact structures and \nphysical violence have on the individuals targeted. It diversifies the \nmovement and accentuates social grievances that have an impact on \npeople’s health and it could serve the purpose of being heard despite the \nlarge-scale of information one receives via social media; especially in light \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    214 \n \nof the harsh rhetoric of conservatives and the ultra-right. The violence \ntriangle would undeniably heat up the rhetoric to some extent. It defines \nunequal structures as violence which will definitely appall opponents of \nanti-LGBTQ* rights – but those will probably get outraged no matter which \ntactic the movement will apply. It might be a risk to choose a harsher \nrhetoric that could lead to an even deeper polarization, but it might also be a \nchance. The violence triangle could gain the attention the movement \ndesperately needs in times of threats to liberal and progressive thoughts, in \ntimes that lay directly ahead of the U.S. people; in times, in which ignorance \nmarginalizes LGBTQ*s and constrains their visibility. It can be a tool to \npoint to the inequality and violence LGBTQ* people have to face \nnationwide each single day. Its potential is that it might even raise more \nawareness among those who are not directly affected by LGBTQ* topics, \nbut also among those who belong to the LGBTQ* community and who are \ndesperately needed to advance equal rights and non-violence policies. The \nviolence triangle can create visibility, it can help to empower the movement \nand reject victimization but it has to be applied carefully. There is a thin line \nbetween creating awareness and alienating those heterosexuals whom the \nmovement wants and needs to be their allies. So, how should this challenge \nbe approached? The answer can only be by openness and dialogue. The \nviolence triangle is supposed to call attention and get through the masses of \ninformation. However, to assure the realization of the movement’s goals and \nprevent alienation, the community has to communicate their situation and \naspirations clearly. The violence triangle should not be used for \ndenouncements but for a demonstration of the restrictions and \nconfrontations LGBTQ*s’ lives bear. The mental and physical effects have \nto be illuminated, but the focus has to be on approaches to solutions. The \nLGBTQ* movement must not isolate itself but has to keep an open dialogue \ngoing that integrates different perceptions. This is how further polarization \nresulting from the embracement of the violence triangle could be prevented. \nThe years ahead will be challenging for the LGBTQ* movement. \nThe current social and political situation is agonistic and the major threat is \nthe disintegration of the movement’s cohesion by the polarization of society. \nThe violence triangle could help to restructure the movement, to spread \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    215 \n \ninclusiveness and to strengthen coherence. It can prevent radicalism of \nLGBTQ*s themselves, if it is carefully applied by gay rights organizations. \nIt is probably only one approach among many that could increase the \nmovement’s efficiency but it might be the right one for the times ahead. \n \n \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    216 \n \nIV. Conclusion \nViolence – once experienced will alter everything. One’s life, health, \nhappiness and trust are on the line. The scars left will always be part of a \nhuman being and old wounds can easily be re-opened. However, being \nvictimized must not remain the response of those affected by violence. \nInstead, they are endowed by the power to strike back. Why should the act \nof violence exclusively be a tool of those who ostensibly possess power? \nWhy should the recounting of this act of violence not be a tool to regain the \npower over one’s destiny? Why not reverse the effect of violence?  \nThis thesis is supposed to be an approach to the applicability of \nGaltung’s violence triangle on the LGBTQ* movement. It is also an attempt \nto elaborate on the movement’s strategies, to counter victimization and \ninequality by the construction of a collective identity including the diversity \nof the LGBTQ* community. I have decided to include Johan Galtung’s \nviolence triangle as a tool for evaluation for specific reasons: Firstly, I \nwanted to illuminate the interrelatedness of two major struggles: The one \nagainst physical violence and the one against inequality. Both are closely \nlinked but not treated as such. Structural violence is only rarely integrated \ninto the activists’ discourse – even though it is occasionally mentioned.  \nSecondly, because I felt like the concept might become valuable for \nthe movement. Plainly as an instrument to respond to violence as well as to \nthe movement’s own shortcomings adequately: To counter power structures, \nto reverse the effect of violence, to create visibility and to destroy egotism \nand ignorance. \nAnd finally: Galtung’s violence triangle is an honest approach; an \napproach that does not limit violence exclusively to physical acts. Instead it \nrecognizes different manifestations of violence. Denying the harmfulness of \na society’s structure is an escape from any responsibility one might have for \nthe misery of those affected negatively. People are suffering from particular \nstructures; LGBTQ* people are often suffering from the heteronormative \nstructure within society. It is easy to hide from the truth and to remain \ninactive but it is also ignorant and eventually costs lives. An attitude like \nthis equals Hannah Arendt’s “banality of evil” theory: The failure to think; \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    217 \n \nthe failure to broaden one’s mind and consider consequences of one’s own \nactions - it may be an active deed or a passive one; the action to exercise \ndirect violence or to tolerate violent structures. The denial of a broader \ninterpretation of violence is a failure to assess the consequences of one’s \nown actions or passiveness; it is a failure to think.  \nEven though Galtung’s concept has often been criticized, I have \nshown that it is applicable in respect to LGBTQ* violence. The thesis’ \nsecond part has additionally exposed that the LGBTQ* movement is able to \napproach the struggle against inequality and violence via social media \nsuccessfully. The integration of social media slowly evolved. While the \nfight for the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was predominantly led by Lady \nGaga in social media networks, the struggle for same-sex marriage \nrepresented the starting point for social media activism by gay rights \norganizations. They embraced a variety of tactics that ranged from personal \nstories of homosexual couples to the support by heterosexual activists. Even \nthough their outreach varied they are all valuable in its own terms. \nSubsequently, inequality confronted by homosexuals in their daily life as \nwell as bullying became major issues. Activists were able to establish \npowerful strategies that served their ambitions to fight for equal rights and \ninfluence the U.S. people as well as significant politicians. However, the \nanalysis also indicates that the movement’s social media activism has flaws \nand that many manifestations of structural violence have been, and still are, \nneglected. Homeless LGBTQ* youths and victims from workplace \ndiscrimination are among those marginalized; simply for the circumstance, \nthat a betterment for them does not result in every individuals’ personal \nadvantage.  \nFurthermore, the representation of direct violence is weak and often \nleads to an alienation of those targeted. The collective identity which is \nbased on the mutual motivation to subvert heteronormativity and end \ninequality is thereby jeopardized. Additionally, a radicalization of some \nparts of the community has become likely and has already taken the first \nsteps.  \nIn the third part of this thesis, the analysis of the socio-economic and \nsocio-political dimension has shown that neoliberal virtues led to the rise of \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    218 \n \negotism which is also responsible for the neglect of a variety of LGBTQ* \npeople by its own major gay rights organizations and the social media \nmovement. Furthermore, the economic circumstances have contributed to a \npolarization of U.S. society that was even further aggravated by the minority \npolitics of the Obama administration. A strong focus on minority – \nespecially LGBTQ* – rights as well as the symbiosis between the LGBTQ* \nmovement and the Obama administration have alienated major parts of \nsociety. They have led to an aggravation of the polarization. The election of \nDonald Trump was symptomatic for the socio-political developments and it \npersonifies the threats the LGBTQ* movement will have to confront in the \nyears ahead: The threat of misinformation, sciolism, and populist politics; \nthe threat of the capacity to influence masses via social media and of the rise \nof conservative and populist politics; and especially the threat of ignorance \nand the loss of ethics and moral rules. \nAs illuminated, Galtung’s violence triangle might be an approach to \nconfront these challenges. Its embrace can strengthen the diversity of the \nmovement, it can – if applied correctly – prevent radicalization within the \ncommunity and it can also call attention to the inequality and violence that \nLGBTQ*s face. Moreover, it exposes the synergy of different forms of \nviolence: direct, structural and cultural. The violence triangle might be a \ntool to empower the LGBTQ* movement and to influence the power \nimbalance in their favor. It will reverse the negative effects of violence; its \nintention to victimize and thereby subordinate LGBTQ* people.  \nEven though the nature and the intensity of LGBTQ* violence has \nchanged over the last decades violence has not disappeared entirely. The \nfight against violence in all its manifestations has not become obsolete but it \nis even more important than ever before. It has to be led in order to prevent \nbacklashes and to counter any attacks on LGBTQ* rights; and also, to \nensure the community’s cohesion and diversity. The advancements of the \nlast years have lured the LGBTQ* movement into a state of fraudulent \nsafety; a safety that hid the shortcomings of the social media movement. \nDonald Trump woke up all those blinded by the achievements of the last \nyears. The LGBTQ* movement has to develop its strategies and partly \nreinvent itself. \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    219 \n \nCurrently, there is no need for LGBTQ* people to pour out to the \nstreets on a dark night in Greenwich Village and fight for their rights. \nToday’s battleground is everywhere – mastering social media is equivalent \nto influencing the masses. This is where we have to succeed; this is where \nwe have to persevere. \n \nTanja Fuchs Violence against Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals    \n    220 \n \nBibliography \n \nPrimary Sources \n \nCollins, Jason and Franz Lidz. “Why NBA center Jason Collins is coming \nout now.” Sports Illustrated, April 29, 2013.
