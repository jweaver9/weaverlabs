[Vol. XLIII In her post, Alcorn explained why she chose to take her life.6  She described the feelings of gender nonconformity she had experienced since she was four, and the joy she felt when she found an explanation for these feelings.7  “When I was 14,” Alcorn wrote, “I learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness.  After 10 years of confusion I finally understood who I was.”8  In her post, Alcorn also explained how her parents did not accept her identity, and the toll this took on her.9  Alcorn’s letter stated, “[w]hen I was 16 I realized that my parents would never come around, and that I would have to wait until I was 18 to start any sort of transitioning treatment, which absolutely broke my heart.  The longer you wait, the harder it is to transition.  I felt hopeless, that I was just going to look like a man in drag for the rest of my life.”10  Alcorn ended her post by stating: “My death needs to mean something.  My death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year.  I want someone to look at that number and say ‘that’s fucked up’ and fix it.  Fix society.  Please.”11 Alcorn’s death drew widespread attention from media outlets and advocacy groups.  Commentators wrote that Alcorn’s letter shed light on the painful experience that many transgender youth face.12  Reports of the incident cited the disproportionately high rate of suicide attempts among transgender youth.13  Prominent transgender writers and actors, such as Laverne Cox, described their own suicide                                                                                                                   6.

In the wake of Alcorn’s death, advocates petitioned Congress to ban “conversion therapy”—psychotherapy aimed at changing an individual’s gender identity or sexual orientation—which Alcorn’s parents forced her to attend.

A congresswoman drafted a Concurrent Resolution that “encourages each state to protect minors from efforts that promote or promise to change sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, based on the premise that being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender nonconforming is a mental illness or developmental disorder that can or should be cured.” H.R.

Alcorn’s death has also brought more light to the violence that transwomen are subjected to as commentators noted the disproportionate media attention that Alcorn’s death received when compared to the growing trend of murders of transgender women of color.

When we fail to illuminate the dimmed narratives of trans people of color while advocating for justice exclusively for white trans people, we further notions of white supremacy.”).  16.

[Vol. XLIII Academy of Family Physicians,21 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Psychological Association have recognized a form of anxiety, termed gender dysphoria (GD), that results from a discrepancy between an individual’s sex identity assigned at birth and their gender identity.22  Mental health experts note that GD can exist during childhood and adolescence and that gender-affirming healthcare can alleviate GD.23  Indeed, mental health organizations, such as AMA, have noted the seriousness of GD and the medical necessity of gender-affirming healthcare for certain individuals.24  Without access to gender-affirming healthcare, individuals experiencing GD may develop “clinically significant psychological distress, dysfunction, debilitating depression, and . . . suicidality.25”  Thus, gender-affirming healthcare may be necessary for at least some adolescents.  Given the experience of transgender youth like Leelah Alcorn, it is imperative for policy makers to consider adolescent access to medically necessary gender-affirming healthcare. The psychological effects of GD raise important concerns for policymakers considering whether adolescents should have access to medically necessary gender-affirming healthcare.

Transgender youth may be particularly vulnerable and in need of medical services in urban areas, as reports on runaway homeless youth populations suggest that transgender youth are disproportionally represented in the homeless population.29  These youth typically move to urban areas where identity-based homeless services organizations that are best prepared to serve transgender youth are based.30  Municipal governments and urban policymakers therefore have a particular interest in trans youth31 access to gender-affirming healthcare. Despite the medical community’s recognition that gender-affirming healthcare is medically necessary for certain transgender youth, many are unable to gain access to it.  Some, like Alcorn, are deterred from transitioning by their parents or families, while others find that they                                                                                                                   26.

[Vol. XLIII cannot afford the costly treatments and appointments.32  While many private insurers have begun to cover gender-affirming healthcare,33 the majority of state Medicaid programs do not.34  Thus, in recent years, trans-rights activists have advocated for greater access to gender-affirming healthcare.  New York, California, Vermont, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Washington D.C. have lifted the bans in their Medicaid programs for coverage of gender-affirming healthcare, but several of these states restrict coverage on the basis of age, requiring individuals to wait until they are eighteen to receive treatment.35 Given the importance of gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth, this Note considers whether age-based restrictions on Medicaid coverage of this healthcare are necessary and good policy.  Part I of this Note provides context for the policy and law regarding gender-affirming healthcare and discusses the terms and rhetorical framing that mental health experts, trans-rights advocates, and legislators use to describe gender-affirming healthcare.  In addition, it outlines the empirical research that supports the commonly held view of the mental health field that gender-affirming healthcare may be a medical necessity for transgender individuals.  Lastly, it outlines the three approaches that states have taken to cover or exclude gender-affirming healthcare from Medicaid. Part II examines the New York Medicaid program, which restricts coverage of gender-affirming healthcare on the basis of age.  This Part also identifies the ways in which an age-based exclusion for Medicaid coverage of medically necessary treatment may conflict                                                                                                                   32.

Finally, Part III of this Note asserts that amending Medicaid programs to cover gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth on a case-by-case basis would avoid the issues that an age-based exclusion presents.  This Part argues that a case-by-case approach would align with the doctrine of informed consent and its exceptions, avoid litigation by providing medically necessary coverage in a non-discriminatory manner, and prevent the negative outcomes that beset too many transgender youth. I.  MEDICAID COVERAGE OF GENDER-AFFIRMING HEALTHCARE As trans-rights advocates have pushed discussion of gender beyond a binary formulation, the rhetorical framing of gender and gender-affirming healthcare has become increasingly central.  This Part provides background on gender-affirming healthcare and the language and terms that this Note will use to describe gender-affirming healthcare and the treatment of GD.  In addition, this Part details the widely held medical consensus regarding transgender-related healthcare and the approaches health professionals have found that can alleviate the distress caused by GD.  Last, this Part describes the extent to which states have extended Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming healthcare and will describe the age-based restrictions in New York’s Medicaid regulation. A. Definitions and Terms Used to Discuss Gender-Affirming Healthcare Language that categorizes and defines people on the basis of sex and gender both frames society’s outlook on sex and is subject to society’s cultural values.36  Such language runs the risk of instilling or reinforcing systems of sexual inequality and normativity.37  For instance, a binary understanding of sex and gender that categorizes all individuals as either male or female on the basis of criteria founded                                                                                                                   36.

L.J. [Vol. XLIII on ideas of “maleness” and “femaleness” works to marginalize individuals who do not meet these criteria.38  Advocates of transgender rights have thus pushed for changes in terminology to counter this marginalization.39  In particular, trans-rights activists and queer linguists have used language as a means of challenging a binary understanding of gender and the view of gender nonconformity as a mental illness or disorder.40  In this manner, language may be viewed as not merely descriptive, but political, and some scholars argue that all language that categorizes or classifies transgender people, by its nature, is not neutral.41  The terms used to classify medical treatments that are medically necessary for many transgender individuals are similarly not neutral and risk pathologizing gender-nonconformity.42 The notion of sex is central to any discussion involving the recognition of transgender rights under the law.  A common misconception of sex is that it is assigned at birth as either male or female on the basis of external genitalia.43  Genitalia, however, is not                                                                                                                   38.

However, in order to clearly address the statutes, it will be necessary to use the terms of these regulations and even adopt their framing of gender dysphoria in a manner which may appear to pathologize the experience of gender non-conforming and transgender individuals.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Adolescent Gender Dysphoria  This section explores the medical community’s acceptance of GD as a clinical condition that requires treatment and the development of appropriate health protocols to treat it.  In addition to recognizing the occurrence of GD among adults, the medical community also recognizes that children and adolescents may experience GD.  Indeed, health professionals and psychologists who have studied GD have developed diagnostic criteria for adolescent GD and have outlined the best methods and practices for treatment. 1. Diagnosis of Adolescent Gender Dysphoria The DSM-V classifies GD as “the distress that may accompany the incongruence between one’s experienced or expressed gender and one’s assigned gender.”73  The DSM-V has two separate diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in children74 and gender dysphoria in                                                                                                                   71.

A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). 2. A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). 3.

Occurrence of Gender Dysphoria Among Children and Adolescents It is generally accepted within the medical community that children may experience GD.85  Eminent psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg suggests that children develop an understanding of their gender identity between the ages of five and seven when they realize that they will not be able to change their physiological characteristics.86  More recent studies show that the average age at which transgender participants “felt different from others” was seven and a half years old.87  Other studies indicate that individuals become aware of their “gender difference” at any age before fourteen.88  Collectively, these studies suggest that most transgender individuals are aware of their gender nonconformity during adolescence.89 While the medical community recognizes that children may experience GD, most professionals suggest that treatment is better suited for adolescents.90  Both the DSM-V and the WPATH standards note that children as young as two years old may show indications of GD,91 but that persistence of GD into adolescence and adulthood is                                                                                                                   85.

Treatment of Gender Dysphoria Among Adolescents The WPATH Standards of Care outline proper treatment for GD that could include psychological interventions, social interventions, and physical interventions.97  This “triadic therapy” approach has been embraced by psychologists.98  Psychological interventions consist of psychotherapy that is focused on reducing the distress related to GD.99  Social interventions consist of the individual taking on the cultural role of the desired gender identity so that they may appreciate the familial, interpersonal, and legal consequences of                                                                                                                   92.

Medicaid Coverage of Gender-Affirming Healthcare Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps individuals with low income or low resources pay for health services and medical treatments.105  Although states receive federal funding for Medicaid, states’ governments establish and define the scope of their Medicaid programs.106  Because gender-affirming healthcare is costly, individuals seeking to transition often cannot afford to pay for treatment on their own,107 and only a few state Medicaid programs provide coverage for gender-affirming healthcare.108  States that do not expressly cover gender-affirming treatments either expressly deny Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare or deny coverage                                                                                                                   100.

Federal and Private Insurance Coverage of Gender-Affirming Healthcare Due to the high costs of gender-affirming healthcare, most individuals who seek to transition can only do so if the treatment is covered by private insurers or Medicaid.111  A 2001 study found that the average cost for male-to-female gender-affirming surgery and hormones was close to $20,000 over the course of three years.112  That same study found that the average cost of female-to-male gender-affirming surgery and hormones was $16,512 over a three-year period.113  More recent reports vary, with some suggesting that the cumulative costs could be between $40,000 and $100,000.114  Gender-affirming healthcare is thus likely to be cost-prohibitive if covered by an individual alone.                                                                                                                   109.

L.J. [Vol. XLIII These costs present significant challenges to a large proportion of the transgender population, as many individuals cannot afford gender-affirming healthcare.  One reason for this is that transgender individuals are disproportionately subjected to employment discrimination and wage discrimination.115  In a 2011 study of transgender individuals, fifteen percent of respondents reported making $10,000 or less per year, a percentage nearly four times that of the general population.116  Transgender youth, in particular, are also less likely to have the means to meet the costs of gender-affirming healthcare, as they typically are dependent on a parent for access to healthcare coverage and because transgender youth are overrepresented among runaway and homeless youth.117 In recent years, more employers have implemented health benefit plans that cover some form of gender-affirming healthcare.118  State and municipal legislatures have created incentives for insurance companies and businesses to cover gender-affirming healthcare.119  In New York, for instance, the Department of Financial Services issued a circular in 2014 clarifying that a denial of gender-affirming treatments, where that treatment is otherwise covered, would be a                                                                                                                   115.

Three Approaches to Medicaid Coverage of Gender-Affirming Healthcare In regulating the coverage of their Medicaid plans, states fall into one of three distinct groups.  First, a minority of states have promulgated regulations that expressly exclude Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare or gender-affirming surgery.128  The language of these statutes varies in breadth: some arguably only limit the exclusion to gender-affirming surgical procedures,129 while others use broader language that clearly excludes all forms of gender-affirming healthcare.130  Second, a majority of states do not have regulations that expressly deny coverage for gender-affirming healthcare or gender-affirmation surgery, but nonetheless, they have a practice of not extending coverage on the grounds that the treatments are not “medically necessary.”131  These states have prevailed in federal court against challenges seeking coverage, as the                                                                                                                   126. “Medicaid offers the States a bargain: Congress provides federal funds in exchange for the States’ agreement to spend them in accordance with congressionally imposed conditions.” Armstrong v.

New York’s Medicaid Coverage of Gender-Affirming Healthcare Before 2014, New York statutorily excluded all gender-affirming healthcare from Medicaid coverage.135  Section 505.2 of title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) sets forth the physicians’ services the New York State Medicaid program covers.136  When section 505.2 was promulgated in 1998, it denied coverage for all care, services, drugs, or supplies rendered for the purpose of gender reassignment or any care, services, drugs, or supplies intended to promote such treatment.137  In December 2014, however, the New York State Department of Health proposed an amendment to the regulation that would authorize Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming healthcare.138  The amendment was the result of a twelve-year campaign139 by transgender-rights advocates that included the                                                                                                                   132.

The most problematic requirement imposed by section 505.2 is its limitation of coverage for hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery on the basis of age.155  Section 505.2 limits coverage for gender-affirming surgery that results in sterilization to patients who are twenty-one or older.156  Further, the regulation limits coverage for hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery that does not result in sterilization to patients who are eighteen or older.157  At least one other state, Vermont, has implemented a similar age restriction in their Medicaid program that excludes coverage for individuals under the age of twenty-one.158  New York diverges from a number of states in this regard, as many states have extended Medicaid coverage without age-based restrictions.159  In Oregon, for example, treatment                                                                                                                   152. tit. 18, § 505.2(l).  153.

Gender-affirming healthcare seeks to address GD, the anxiety that results from a discrepancy between one’s gender identity and assigned sex at birth.161  States differ in their Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare to the extent to which they recognize it as medically necessary.162  New York’s Medicaid program recognizes the medical necessity of gender-affirming healthcare for adults, but does not do so for trans youth.163  Putting aside whether this varied coverage reflects the state’s reluctance to acknowledge trans youth and notions of gender nonconformity generally, the age-based restrictions in section 505.2 may be at odds with the public health, legal, and policy goals of the state.164 II.  CONFLICTS IN DOCTRINE AND LAW THAT MAY ARISE FROM MEDICAID AGE RESTRICTIONS ON GENDER-AFFIRMING HEALTHCARE Age-based restrictions on Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming treatment find support and criticism from a number of sources.  This Part discusses the areas of dispute that provide support and opposition to section 505.2 of New York’s Medicaid program.  Section II.A describes the debate within the medical community as to whether gender-affirming treatment is medically necessary for individuals under the age of eighteen and the difficulties that the medical community has faced in determining how to treat GD during adolescence.  Section II.B describes how the doctrine of informed consent might support age-based restrictions on Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming treatment on the grounds that it presumes                                                                                                                   160. Oregon’s medical assistance program regulation provides coverage for treatments included on the prioritized list of services provided by the State’s Health Evidence Review Commission (HERC). See id.

In contrast, Section II.B also examines how the statutory definitions and exceptions to the doctrine of informed consent allow for minors to make informed health decisions and, therefore, undermine a bright-line age-restriction.  Section II.C examines the different legal claims that may result from the age-based restrictions and whether they justify removing the age-based restriction on coverage. A. The Medical Community’s View as to the Medical Necessity of Gender-Affirming Treatment for Individuals Under the Age of Eighteen Dispute amongst the medical community regarding the diagnosis of childhood GD may support the implementation of an age-based restriction on Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming treatment.  While the DSM-V, WPATH, and APA recognize that it is possible for children to experience GD, research suggests that treating children under the age of twelve for GD may be unnecessary.165  The WPATH Standards of Care note that some children may stop experiencing GD when they begin puberty and do not affirmatively recommend physical interventions for children.166  The APA also notes that it is not possible to differentiate between children who will cease to experience GD from those in whom GD will persist into adolescence and adulthood.167  Further complicating the treatment of GD during childhood is the lack of randomized controlled studies which might otherwise allow for a clear consensus to develop on the best methods of treating children who are experiencing GD.168  Thus,                                                                                                                   165.

The APA has identified two general approaches to treating GD during childhood: one which encourages a child to explore their expressed gender identity, 2016] FIXING MEDICAID TO \"FIX SOCIETY\" 101 proponents of the age-based restriction may argue that there is little support for providing Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming treatment for individuals under the age of twelve. Treating GD during adolescence also presents concerns that may support the implementation of an age-based restriction.  Adolescents may have concurring mental health conditions that may make it more difficult for a mental health expert to assess them.169  In addition, adolescents can become intensely focused on their immediate desires, which may make it difficult to assess whether they are cognitively and emotionally capable of making the decision to pursue gender-affirming treatment.170  As a result of these concerns, some health professionals are also reluctant to treat adolescent GD on the grounds that it may motivate an adolescent to seek unnecessary treatment.171 Despite these concerns regarding the diagnosis and treatment of adolescent and childhood GD, the weight of support within the medical community supports gender-affirming treatment for adolescents who need it.172  The DSM-V has recognized the unique challenges in diagnosing childhood GD by adopting a separate                                                                                                                  and another which encourages a child to adopt their assigned gender role and sex identity at birth.

The latter is based on a view that it may be less desirable for a child to adopt a non-conforming gender identity because of the social stigma that is often attached to transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.

The support for treating adolescent GD is based on studies that indicate that adolescents who experience GD throughout childhood are likely to experience those feelings into adulthood.176  Thus, unlike children, most adolescents will continue to experience GD without intervention.177  Additionally, adolescents beyond the age of twelve are more likely to have a firmer understanding of gender constancy,178 and thus are more likely to experience persistent GD.179  The growing consensus surrounding treatment of GD during adolescence is also reflected in empirical research that shows an increasing number of adolescents are seeking treatment for gender dysphoria and are living in their desired gender role upon entering high school.180  Mental health experts thus note the need to address GD earlier and,                                                                                                                   173.

Before developing the capacity for concrete operational thought, children often conflate gender identity with surface expressions of gender identity.

The suppressants, which suspend the development of unwanted secondary sex characteristics, may be a viable option for adolescents who are experiencing GD.182  The Endocrine Society has also developed guidelines for the use of these suppressants that allow patients to decide, after several years of treatment, whether to pursue further gender-affirming treatment or to develop the secondary sex characteristics of their assigned sex at birth.183  A 2010 follow-up study of seventy adolescents who began taking puberty suppressants between the ages of twelve and sixteen found that all participants continued to pursue gender-affirming treatment into adulthood and demonstrated a significant decrease in depression and emotional problems.184  More recently in 2014, a follow-up study of adolescents who began taking puberty suppressants found that those adolescents were generally satisfied with the results and had greater psychological functioning as a result.185  Thus, medical research may also support extending Medicaid coverage to gender-affirming treatments such as puberty suppressants to individuals under the age of eighteen.                                                                                                                   181. de Vries et al., supra note 94, at 2277 (“However, as secondary sex characteristics develop before the age of 16, waiting for medical interventions is highly upsetting for most younger adolescents.”); see also Cohen-Kettenis et al., supra note 166, at 263 (“Despite the early onset of the disorder, in most countries it is common practice not to start the actual SRS procedure earlier than 18 or even 21 years of age.”); Yolanda L.S.

Age Restrictions on the Access to Gender-Affirming Healthcare May be Inconsistent with Principles of Informed Consent Conflicting rationales for and against an age-based restriction on Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming treatment may also be based on the doctrine of informed consent.  The doctrine of informed consent presumes that minors do not have the capacity to fully understand health decisions and, thus, cannot give informed consent to treatment.186  The doctrine may provide support for the age-based restrictions in section 505.2 on the grounds that adolescents would not be able to provide consent to undergo gender-affirming treatment.  On the other hand, statutory definitions and exceptions to the doctrine of informed consent may suggest that a bright-line age restriction to coverage is inappropriate. 1. Support for the Age-Based Restriction as a Mechanism to Enforce the Doctrine of Informed Consent The doctrine of informed consent generally limits the kinds of decisions minors can make without parental consent on the grounds that children and adolescents do not have the capacity to make fully informed decisions.187  The Supreme Court has consistently upheld the doctrine and distinguished adolescents from fully formed adults who have a greater capacity to make decisions.188  In Roper v. Simmons, the Court held that the Eighth Amendment forbids the imposition of the death penalty on offenders who are under the age of eighteen at the time of the offense.189  The Court reasoned that the death penalty is an unnecessary and inappropriate punishment for adolescent offenders because adolescents are more likely than adults to engage in reckless behavior and are not likely to consider the consequences of their actions.190  Justice Kennedy noted that research confirms “a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in youth more often than in adults . . . .  These qualities often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions                                                                                                                   186.

Id. at 569–72. 2016] FIXING MEDICAID TO \"FIX SOCIETY\" 105 and decisions.”191  Kennedy thus reasoned that the law should treat youth differently than adults because of a discrepancy in decision-making capability.192 The Court has similarly considered the limited decision-making capabilities of adolescents in the context of health decisions.193  In Bellotti v. Baird, the Court heard a challenge to a Massachusetts statute that required minors to obtain parental consent or authorization from a court before undergoing abortions.194  While the Court acknowledged the constitutional right of a pregnant minor to choose to terminate her pregnancy, it ultimately held that the vulnerability of children, their inability to make important decisions, and the state’s interest in protecting the parental role in child rearing justified limiting the scope of a child’s constitutional rights.195  Writing for the majority, Justice Powell concluded that because “immature minors often lack the ability to make fully informed choices that take into account both the immediate and long-range consequences,”196 states may validly “limit the freedom of children to choose for themselves in the making of important, affirmative choices with potentially serious consequences.”197  The  Court thus balanced the doctrine of informed consent with an adolescent’s right to choose to terminate a pregnancy by upholding the Massachusetts requirement for parental consent on the condition that the state also allows adolescents to bypass the requirement when a court finds that the minor is mature enough to make a fully informed decision and that the decision is in her best interests.198 The Court’s decisions in Bellotti and Roper may provide support for the age-based restriction in section 505.2.  The reasoning in Roper adopted the view of adolescents as being susceptible to reckless                                                                                                                   191.

If one or both of the mother’s parents refuse such consent, consent may be obtained by order of a judge of the superior court for good cause shown, after such hearing as he deems necessary.”)   195.

Age-Based Restrictions May Conflict with Exceptions to the Doctrine of Informed Consent While the doctrine of informed consent may support age-based restrictions on gender-affirming treatment, the statutory definitions of informed consent suggest that a blanket age-restriction is inappropriate.  Although most states set the age of informed consent at eighteen, statutory definitions also generally focus on the capacity of the individual to make decisions about his or her health.201  For instance, in New York, informed consent “means that the patient has to demonstrate the intellect to understand what is being proposed, to realize and assess the risks and benefits, and to voluntarily consent to or refuse the proposed major medical treatment.”202  On this basis, some states, such as Oregon, have set the age of consent below the age of eighteen, which authorizes adolescents to give informed consent when they are fifteen.203  Thus, the age-based restriction of section 505.2 may conflict with the doctrine of informed consent as it focuses solely on the age of the individual and not his or her actual ability to make informed decisions.                                                                                                                   199.

International Population Services,219 a number of states permit minors to give informed consent to obtain contraceptives or abortions without parental consent.220  New York also allows minors to give informed consent for procedures that are not constitutionally protected, such as prenatal care, substance abuse treatment, and certain outpatient mental health services.221 Thus, statutory definitions and exceptions to the doctrine of informed consent may provide support for removing the age-based restrictions in section 505.2.  Definitions of informed consent generally focus on the decision-making capacity of individuals.222  Despite being more prone to emotionally charged situations, adolescents have been shown to have the same decision-making capacity as adults and may exercise the same or similar judgment as adults when making healthcare related decisions.223  Furthermore, states appear to have recognized that, in some health contexts, adolescents have the capacity to give informed consent.224  Although the doctrine of informed consent presumes minors are incapable of making informed decisions, the definitions and exceptions to the doctrine also suggest that adolescents may have the capacity to make                                                                                                                   217.

State programs, such as New York’s, that deny coverage of gender-affirming treatment on the basis of age may be susceptible to legal claims brought by individuals under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which prohibits programs from discriminating on the basis of gender identity.226  Likewise, states that restrict Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming treatment on the basis of age may be subject to HHS enforcement actions on the grounds that such restrictions violate 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq., otherwise known as the Medicaid Act.227 1. Age-Based Restrictions Could Give Rise to Claims Under the Affordable Care Act A Medicaid regulation that imposes age restrictions on hormone therapy and gender affirming surgery could give rise to legal claims brought under the Affordable Care Act.

First, while HHS has implied that disparate coverage for transgender individuals amounts to sex discrimination,231 federal courts have yet to recognize transgender identity as a protected status.232 The ACA’s prohibition on sex discrimination draws its authority from Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.233  Title IX prohibits programs that receive federal financial assistance from denying benefits on the basis of sex.234  Although the ACA does not explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity, the Director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights, the body that enforces the anti-discrimination provisions of the ACA, issued a letter to trans-rights advocates clarifying HHS’s view that the ACA anti-discrimination provision extends to discrimination on the basis of                                                                                                                   229.

Individual Medicaid recipients would also have a private cause of action to challenge a state’s Medicaid program under Title IX.240  The ACA expressly adopts the enforcement mechanisms of Title IX to prohibit a denial of benefits on the basis of sex,241 and the United States Supreme Court has read an implied right of action into Title IX.242  In Cannon v. University of Chicago, the Court held that while it is better for Congress to specify when a statute provides a right of action, its failure to do so is not dispositive.243  Examining Title IX, the Court used a four-factor test to find that the statute was intended to include a private right of action.244  Additionally, the Court noted that                                                                                                                   235.

However, the likelihood of success of these claims may be uncertain given courts’ interpretation of Title IX as it applies to discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Although HHS has made clear its view that discrimination on the basis of transgender identity is unlawful under Title IX, courts have not recognized transgender identity as a protected status under Title IX. 247  For instance, in Johnston v. University of Pittsburgh, the Western District of Pennsylvania held that a university receiving federal funds did not violate Title IX by prohibiting a transgender male student from using sex-segregated locker rooms and bathrooms.248  In order to determine whether the language of Title IX could be construed as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity, the court referred to Title VII claims of employment discrimination.249  Circuit Courts have generally held that Title VII does not prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity, but rather only prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of a traditional binary formulation of sex.250  Thus, while it                                                                                                                  a federal statute provides a private of action: “1) whether the statute was enacted for the benefit of a special class of which the plaintiff is a member, (2) whether there is any indication of legislative intent to create a private remedy, (3) whether implication of such a remedy is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme, and (4) whether implying a federal remedy is inappropriate because the subject matter involves an area basically of concern to the States.” Id. at 689–709.  245.

Hopkins,254 the Supreme Court held that an employer violated Title VII when it denied a female employee a promotion on the grounds that she did meet stereotypes associated with women.255  Transgender litigants might find support with this theory as the Department of Education has released letters of clarification, informing school districts that it will apply the prohibition on sex-stereotyping of Title VII to Title IX.256  Courts have also construed Title IX as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of non-conformity with gender stereotypes.257  However, it is not evident that litigants would prevail under a sex-stereotyping theory, as the court in Johnston held that the                                                                                                                   251.

In addition to facing challenges as to whether Title IX would prohibit the age-based restriction of Medicaid coverage, litigants would also have to show that the restriction did in fact discriminate on the basis of sex.260  Litigants might be able to argue that the age restrictions are discriminatory as they deny transgender youth medically necessary treatments that are otherwise offered to cisgender youth.261  Claimants could offer evidence of the surgeries such as “complete mastectomy, mammoplasty, plastic operation on breasts, reconstructive surgery of the genitalia, amputation of the penis, plastic operation on penis, orchiectomy, scrotoplasty, urethroplasty, construction of artificial vagina with or without graft, vulvectomy, episioplasty, salpingo-ooporectomy, and hysterectomy,” are all listed on the state’s schedule for reimbursement and could thus be available to cisgender minors who require these procedures for conditions other than GD. 262  In addition, claimants could offer evidence that puberty suppressors could be covered for cisgender youth but not for transgender youth as the FDA has approved use of certain hormones for the treatment of early onset puberty, diagnosed as “precocious puberty.”263  For instance, New York’s Medicaid                                                                                                                   258.

On the other hand, it is also unclear as to whether such evidence would be sufficient, even if a court considers the view of HHS.  While Zucker proved to be successful and consisted of claims under the Medicaid Act and Title IX, a case brought by transgender youth would face a number of new obstacles.  First, it may be difficult to obtain evidence that Medicaid provides coverage for hormones for cisgender adolescents or coverage for genital surgery.266  The state has also asserted that the age restriction was put in place because the FDA has not approved puberty suppressants or hormones to treat GD for individuals under the age of eighteen.267  In at least one other state, however, Medicaid would cover puberty suppressants because the FDA has approved the use of such drugs to treat precocious puberty.268  The conflicting views of the HHS and the courts as to whether Title IX would prohibit discrimination on the basis of transgender identity provide support and opposition to the assertion that the age-based restriction is vulnerable to legal challenges.  Further, it is also unclear whether or not there would be factual or legal support for a discrimination claim under the ACA and, consequently, whether the age-based-restriction on Medicaid coverage leaves the state vulnerable to legal challenges brought by individuals.                                                                                                                   264.

Morris, supra note 263. 2016] FIXING MEDICAID TO \"FIX SOCIETY\" 117 2. Age Restrictions May Be Vulnerable to Challenges Under the Reasonable Standards Requirement of the Medicaid Act In addition to claims brought by individuals, New York’s age-based restriction on Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare may also face enforcement actions by HHS for violating Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Medicaid Act).  While individuals do not have a private right of action under the Medicaid Act, the Secretary of HHS is authorized to withhold Medicaid funds from a state that violates the Medicaid Act.269  The Medicaid Act requires states to implement Medicaid programs with “reasonable standards”270 that must aim to provide medical services “sufficient in amount, duration, and scope to reasonably achieve its purpose.”271  In addition, states may not arbitrarily deny or reduce treatment solely because of the type of illness.272  Because there is some support from the medical community that gender affirming treatment is medically necessary for adolescents, the Secretary could find that the age-based restriction is unreasonable.273  In this circumstance, New York could risk the withdrawal of Medicaid funding by the Secretary of HHS. a. The Medicaid Act Conditions Federal Funding of State Medicaid Programs on Certain Requirements Medicaid regulations that limit coverage of gender-affirming healthcare on the basis of age might be viewed as failing to comply with the requirements of the Medicaid Act.274  The objective of the Medicaid Act was to enable states to provide medical assistance to those who could not afford it.275  In order to meet this objective, the Medicaid Act authorizes the federal government to disburse funds to states with Medicaid programs that provide medical assistance and treatment to individuals who meet income and categorical eligibility requirements.276                                                                                                                   269. 42 U.S.C. § 1396(c) (2012).  270.

[Vol. XLIII The Supreme Court views the Medicaid Act as a contract between the states and the federal government.277  States thus must comply with federal Medicaid statutes and regulations in order to receive federal Medicaid funds.278  Under § 1396(c) of the Medicaid Act, the Secretary of HHS is authorized to withhold all or a portion of a state’s Medicaid funds when a state “breaches” the contract by failing to comply with the requirements of the Act.279  In Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, the Court held that Congress intended § 1396(c) to be the exclusive remedy for a state’s failure to comply with the Act.280  Under this framework, the Court held that the Medicaid Act does not provide an implied right of action and, therefore, may not be enforced by private claims.281  As such, states will not face private litigation under the Medicaid Act, but could still face enforcement action from the Secretary of HHS. b. Programs That Restrict Coverage of Gender-Affirming Healthcare May Be Interpreted as Unreasonable Section 1396(a) of the Medicaid Act requires that all state Medicaid programs provide coverage for seven broad categories of medical assistance: inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, laboratory and x-ray, nursing facility, physician, nurse-midwife, and nurse-practitioner services.282  States may also provide coverage for optional services, such as prescription drugs;283 however, they must comply with federal regulations if they choose to do so.284  While the Medicaid Act broadly requires that these services be provided, states have the authority to decide the type and range of services covered and the eligibility of individuals.285  In determining the scope of coverage, states must use “reasonable standards . . . for determining eligibility                                                                                                                   277.

In Lankford v. Sherman, for instance, the Eighth Circuit held that a plan that excludes a non-experimental and medically necessary treatment from a covered service is per se unreasonable.291  Additionally, in Beal v. Doe, the Supreme Court noted in dicta that a Medicaid program seriously conflicts with the objectives of the Medicaid Act if it does not cover medically necessary treatment.292  Given that HHS has already acknowledged the medical necessity of gender-affirming healthcare for Medicare recipients,293 it may similarly view exclusion of these services from coverage as unreasonable. Section 505.2 may also be construed as unreasonable should the Secretary find that it is discriminatory.  The Medicaid Act requires that “the medical assistance made available to any individual . . . shall not be less in amount, duration, or scope than the medical assistance                                                                                                                   286. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(17); Beal v.

However, similar to a Title IX claim, the Secretary would have to find evidence that certain treatments are covered for cisgender youth, but not for transgender youth when intended to treat GD.  There may be little evidence to suggest that cisgender youth have greater access to puberty suppressors or other procedures that might also be gender-affirming treatments. The Secretary could also find that the age restrictions are unreasonable, as they contradict the Medicaid Act’s requirement that state plans provide Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT).  The Medicaid Act mandates all states to provide EPSDT for Medicaid eligible children under the age of twenty-one.296  EPSDT consists of regular screenings and treatment of “mental illnesses and conditions discovered by screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the State plan.”297  As such, EPSDT requires states to provide screening and treatment for Medicaid-eligible children.298  An adolescent could therefore be diagnosed with GD under EPSDT and require treatment but ultimately be denied treatment because of the age-based restrictions of section 505.  However, at least one court has found that EPSDT services are still subject to, and may be denied on, the basis of the state’s determination that such treatment is not medically necessary.299 The state may therefore be vulnerable to enforcement action by the HHS on the basis that the age-based restriction is unreasonable and violates the Medicaid Act.  While there is some support to suggest that the HHS could proceed with such an action, the Secretary may also be unable to do so without greater evidence of the medical necessity of gender-affirming treatments for adolescents and evidence that the age-based restriction discriminates on the basis of transgender identity.                                                                                                                   294. 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(B); 42 C.F.R. § 440.240(a).  295. 42 C.F.R. §440.230(c); Lankford, 541 F.3d at 506.  296. 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r).  297.

PROPOSAL FOR MEDICAID REGULATIONS THAT EXTEND COVERAGE TO TRANSGENDER YOUTH Given the myriad of issues that arise from Medicaid regulations that exclude coverage of gender-affirming healthcare on the basis of age, states should consider viable alternatives.  One alternative to the age-based restriction is to replace the bright-line age limit with a case-by-case assessment of the individual recipient that is aligned with the WPATH Standards of Care.300  This Part explains how replacing the restrictions would ensure that the state’s Medicaid program covers medically necessary treatment, resolve any conflicts that the Medicaid program might have with the doctrine of informed consent, and avoid the risk of litigation that the state might face under the current age-based restriction.  Further, this Part discusses the likely policy outcomes and costs that justify removing the age-based restriction. A. Necessary Provisions for a Trans-Inclusive Medicaid Program to Meet Medical and Legal Standards States would avoid the issues that age restrictions present by amending or enacting regulations that are aligned with the WPATH Standard of Care.  In so doing, states would provide for a more flexible approach that is based on the individual recipient’s need for treatment.301  Additionally, removing the blanket age restriction would allow states to comply with principles of informed consent and recognize the exceptions to informed consent.302  States would further find that aligning Medicaid regulations with the WPATH Standard of Care would provide safeguards against inadequate treatment and erroneous diagnoses of GD. 1. States Should Align Regulations with WPATH Standards States should amend their Medicaid regulations so as to align them with the WPATH Standards of Care.  By doing so, states would avoid possible HHS litigation and regulation.303  Aligning regulations to the WPATH Standards of Care would also avoid conflicts with the medical consensus on gender identity because it would determine coverage on an individualized basis, provide sufficient safeguards so as to ensure that individuals receive care they need, provide standards to determine whether health professionals are eligible to treat                                                                                                                   300.

[Vol. XLIII transgender patients, and develop contemporaneously with research in the field.304  By aligning regulations with the WPATH Standards of Care, states would remove the age restrictions for Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare and also address the concerns of cost and efficacy on which the age restriction is predicated.305 a. Aligning Regulations with the WPATH Standards of Care Would Determine Coverage on an Individual Basis Rather Than a Fixed Age By aligning their Medicaid statutes with the WPATH Standards of Care, states would determine Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming healthcare on a basis that is more consistent with the generally accepted view of the medical community.  The Standards of Care provides guidelines for mental health practitioners working with gender-nonconforming youth, noting that health professionals should work with individuals to assess their desire and medical necessity for gender-affirming healthcare.306  This approach is preferable to determining eligibility for gender-affirming healthcare on the basis of a fixed-age limit, as psychology experts have argued that “psychological and somatic maturity varies largely interindividually.”307  Given the varying levels of maturity between individuals under the age of eighteen, experts have found that a determination of treatment based on a fixed age is arbitrary and less appropriate than a determination based on individual evaluation.308 Determining Medicaid coverage on an individual basis would further avoid the potential litigation described in Part II of this Note.309  Providing coverage on an individual basis would preclude challenges under the ACA.310  Also, as noted earlier, challenges under the ACA would likely assert that state plans discriminate on the basis of gender identity by providing coverage for hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgical procedures for cisgender adolescents but not for transgender adolescents.311  Under the individualized approach of the Standards of Care, states would provide these same treatments on the permissible basis of medical necessity, allowing for some                                                                                                                   304.

Litigants would therefore be unlikely to assert that the individualized approach determines coverage on the impermissible basis of gender identity. Adopting the WPATH Standards of Care would also avoid HHS enforcement actions.  Under the Medicaid Act, the Secretary of HHS is authorized to withhold Medicaid funds when states violate the Medicaid Act.312  Under a WPATH-aligned regulation, the Secretary would not be authorized to withhold funds on the grounds that the state was failing to provide reasonable standards.  Further, if states amended regulations to expressly align with the WPATH Standards of Care, they would ensure that the Medicaid regulations remained reasonable even as the field of transgender health developed.  As an international organization, WPATH has issued new editions of the Standards of Care to remain consistent with developments in the field of transgender health.  For instance, transgender advocates and health professionals have noted that the most recent edition of the Standards of Care made a number of significant modifications and improvements.313 In addition to providing a medically sound basis for extending coverage to transgender youth, aligning regulations with the WPATH Standards of Care would provide quality control measures to ensure individuals receive proper healthcare and assessment.  The WPATH Standards of Care set forth standards of competency for health professionals working with transgender youth that exceeds standards of competency observed in New York.314  Under section 505.2, mental health professionals are authorized to refer patients for gender-affirming healthcare if they are qualified New York state-licensed professionals.315  The WPATH provides a higher standard, requiring that health professionals have knowledge of gender-nonconformity                                                                                                                   312. 42 U.S.C. § 1396c (2012).  313. Among the changes that advocates have noted in Volume 7 of the WPATH Standards of Care are: the recognition that gender nonconformity is not at disorder, that attempts to change a person’s gender identity through therapy are ineffective, and discussion of a wider range of treatment options.

L.J. [Vol. XLIII and assessment of gender dysphoria treatment and that they pursue continuing education of gender dysphoria assessment.316  These requirements would provide stronger safeguards to ensure Medicaid recipients receive gender-affirming healthcare when it is necessary.  Further, these safeguards would also encourage medical professionals to develop their cultural competency317 when working with transgender youth, and prevent litigation under the ACA’s provision prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity. 2. New York Should Align Its Regulation with the Exceptions for Informed Consent A state regulation that does not implement an age-based restriction on Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare would also avoid conflicting with the principles of the informed consent doctrine and its exceptions.  As noted in Part II of this Note, a fixed-age restriction would conflict with the doctrine of informed consent and the exceptions to informed consent.318  Age-based restrictions bar youth that have been deemed “mature minors” from accessing gender-affirming healthcare, despite the youth’s authorization to provide informed consent.  States that remove age limits in their Medicaid regulations will allow these youth, who are deemed capable of giving informed consent, the ability to make their own health choices pursuant to their status-based exception.  Further, removing the age-based restrictions would also be consistent with the procedure-based exceptions that many states have.  As noted in Part II, states permit minors to provide informed consent to certain kinds of procedures that are medically necessary but, nonetheless, require parental consent, such as contraceptives, abortions, and mental health.319  Gender-affirming healthcare could be considered comparable to these types of procedures in that they are medically necessary but are often denied as a result of parents’ refusal to consent.  In New York, youth are permitted to consent to certain kinds of mental health treatments yet are statutorily prohibited from consenting to gender-affirming healthcare, which is intended to treat                                                                                                                   316.

By removing the age-based restriction, youth would be permitted to consent to gender-affirming healthcare, as they would be permitted to consent to other forms of mental health treatment. While the removing the age restrictions would allow states to consistently recognize the exceptions to informed consent, it would not necessarily remove the requirement for informed consent.  Research suggests that there may not be an entirely objective criterion for diagnosing GD, such as chromosomes or hormonal levels.320  Moreover, because an individual’s gender identity is defined solely by his or her own intrinsic sense of gender, a regulation that did not require that the recipient be capable of understanding the consequences of undergoing gender-affirming procedures would contradict WPATH Standards, which also require the treating physician to abide by informed-consent law.  States that amend their regulations to remove the age restrictions would therefore provide access for youth who need gender-affirming healthcare and who have the mental and emotional capacity to understand their decision to pursue treatment for GD. B. Policy Justifications for Extending Medicaid Coverage of Gender-Affirming Healthcare Removing the age-based restrictions to Medicaid coverage may also have a number of positive policy implications.  Lifting the age-based restriction in section 505.2 would align New York’s Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming treatment for youths with that of state agencies responsible for youths in custody.  In addition, restricting access to gender-affirming surgery that results in sterilization may prevent transgender youth who are over eighteen from obtaining the benefits that conform with their gender identity.321  Therefore, youth may be denied benefits because they sought medically necessary treatment.  Most importantly, by denying transgender youth in New York access to gender-affirming care, the state requires them to endure mental distress and, in so doing, puts them at a greater risk of physical harm.                                                                                                                   320.

Replacing the Age-Based Restrictions Will Resolve the Disparity in Health Coverage That Youth May Receive When in Custody of the State Removing the age-based restriction of Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming treatment would avoid a negative policy outcome whereby youth find they have access to gender-affirming treatment while in the custody of the state but do not have access to those same treatments when they are covered by Medicaid.  The Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) is the agency responsible for supervising child welfare, foster care, and juvenile justice in New York City.322  ACS is required by law to provide “necessary medical or surgical care . . . for any child needing such care and [to] pay for such care from public funds, if necessary.”323  In In re Brian L., the New York Appellate Division interpreted this statute to require ACS to pay for all necessary care, including that which is not covered by the state’s Medicaid regulations.324  Following the decision in Brian L., ACS released guidelines and procedures for requesting payment for Non-Medicaid Reimbursable Treatments (NMR), which were later amended to provide reimbursements of “gender-affirming healthcare associated with Gender Dysphoria,” often referred to as “trans-related healthcare.”325 Thus, under the NMR guidelines, children in ACS foster care or in the custody of New York State may be eligible for reimbursement for gender-affirming healthcare.326  In addition, the NMR guidelines also permit ACS to override the objection of parents or foster parents to                                                                                                                   322.

Carrion,328 where the New York Supreme Court found that ACS’s denial of reimbursement for sex-reassignment surgery and hormone therapy was arbitrary and capricious.329  Similarly, youth who are in the custody of the State Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) may have access to gender-affirming healthcare.  In particular, OCFS’s Division of Juvenile Justice, which operates facilities for juvenile offenders, has its own Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning Youth (LGBTQY) policy.330  This policy allows for youth to begin hormone therapy while they are in an OCFS facility if they meet the criteria for treatment in the WPATH Standards of Care.331 By restricting Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare on the basis of age, the New York regulation may promote negative policy.  Youth who are in the custody of ACS or OCFS may be less inclined to reunite with their families and communities if they risk losing hormone therapy as a result.  Therefore, youth who are aware of the possibility of obtaining gender-affirming healthcare may also be inclined to either enter or remain in the custody of the state.  Thus, removing the age-based restrictions of Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming treatment would achieve two positive outcomes.  First, it would allow for greater uniformity between the healthcare that is covered under Medicaid and that provided by ACS and OCFS.  Second, by creating greater uniformity of coverage, the state would avoid creating incentives for youth to remain in the custody of the state or to enter into the custody of the state, where they may be able to obtain gender-affirming healthcare. 2. Removing Age-Based Restrictions Will Allow Individuals to Obtain Benefits Based on Their Legal Sex Without Delay Lifting age-based restrictions for Medicaid coverage would also allow individuals to obtain a legal-sex status that is congruent with their gender identity.  Legal sex is an individual’s sex identity as                                                                                                                   327. Id. at 7.  328. In re D.F. v.

[Vol. XLIII recognized by the law and is typically defined as one’s sex assignment at birth, based on biological genitalia.332  Legal rights and benefits are bound to legal sex as it may determine an individual’s marital rights, parental rights, placement in sex-segregated facilities such as prisons or homeless shelters, and the ability to access social services.333  Thus in order for transgender individuals to obtain benefits and rights that are congruent with their gender identity, they must first seek to obtain or amend their government identification so that it is congruent with their gender identity.334 Typically, requirements for changing gender markers on identification vary by state and form of identification.  While the federal government has amended its requirements for passports, asking for “appropriate clinical treatment for gender transition to the new gender,” states still typically require documentation of genital surgery in order to change the legal gender of a birth certificate.335  Though New York does not require genital surgery to change the gender marker on a birth certificate, an age-restriction that does impose this requirement would force transgender youth to live with an incongruent legal gender and deny them the rights and protections that a correct gender marker would confer.  Without a congruent legal sex, trans youth risk being placed in schools, foster homes, and juvenile justice centers that are incongruent with their gender identity.336 Thus, removing the age-based restriction in states that condition legal sex on GD treatment would allow individuals to obtain a legal-gender status that is congruent with their gender identity.  Doing so would result in youth obtaining gender-appropriate services, rights, and protections that they may not otherwise be afforded.                                                                                                                   332.

Mental Harm and Risk of Violence That Transgender Youth Face Without Treatment The most unfortunate result of the age-based restriction in section 505.2 is the psychological pain that it would force transgender youth to endure.  Psychological authorities, including WPATH, the APA, and the AMA, as well as experts in the field, have recognized that adolescents under the age of eighteen may experience gender dysphoria.337  For some transgender adolescents, these feelings of distress may escalate to the point where youth experience “intense mental misery, isolation and despair if they are prevented from comprehensively living out their wish to belong to the other sex.”338  For these individuals, a regulation that prevents them from obtaining puberty suppressors or other gender-affirming treatment may, thus, force them to endure great psychological pain against the recommendation of their own mental health practitioners. Evidence also suggests that delaying treatment of gender dysphoria may also allow comorbid mental conditions—distinct mental conditions that are co-occurring with GD—to persist.339  Adolescents and children experiencing gender dysphoria have shown elevated levels of emotional problems.340  In adolescents, the most common comorbid mental disorders are anxiety and depression.341  A number of studies have found that transgender youth are at an elevated risk for suicidal ideation and attempts.342  One study that focused on transgender youth, aged fifteen to twenty-one, found that forty-five percent of the participants had thought seriously about killing themselves, and half said that these thoughts were related to their transgender status.343  Another study that was not limited to                                                                                                                   337.

[Vol. XLIII transgender youth found that rates of suicidal ideation were highest amongst participants aged thirteen to nineteen.344 Studies suggest that depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation may not be caused by gender dysphoria alone but, rather, is the result of being targets of negative societal attitudes.  Mental health professionals have found that an individual’s minority status as transgender places him or her at risk of being prejudiced or discriminated against, which in turn may induce anxiety or depression.345  The negative attitudes that a transgender youth experiences can “become internalized, manifesting as negative self-concept, self-destructive behaviors, and low self-esteem.”346  In a study conducted by the Virginia Transgender Health Initiative, transgender youth who had been the victimized at school were almost four times more likely to attempt suicide than those who had not.347 New York’s Medicaid restriction on hormone therapy and gender affirming surgery will force transgender youth to endure psychological pain.  There is little evidence to show that psychotherapy alone can alleviate feelings of gender dysphoria for individuals who meet the criteria for physical intervention.348  In contrast, the general conclusion drawn from studies measuring the success of hormone therapy and gender affirming surgery is that these treatments effectively resolve the gender dysphoria experienced by transgender individuals.349  As a result, a regulation that delays access to hormone therapy and gender affirming surgery will force some number of transgender youth to endure psychological pain. Delaying access to gender-affirming care may also exacerbate any comorbid mental health issues that a transgender individual is experiencing.  The anxiety and depression resulting from the adolescent process of consolidating and forming one’s identity by evaluating it in relation to society may be exacerbated if that individual is unable to substantively acknowledge his or her identity.350  A transgender youth who is denied access to gender-                                                                                                                  344.

Puberty suppressors, gender-affirming surgeries, or hormone treatments prior to the development of secondary sex characteristics will facilitate transgender youth to outwardly express their gender identity to others, in a manner that makes them less susceptible to victimization.352  Further, a more inclusive regulation may help communities accept the existence of adolescent gender dysphoria, which in turn may reduce the negative societal attitudes concerning transgender youth. C. Cost Justifications for Extending Medicaid Coverage of Gender-Affirming Healthcare to Transgender Youth A state regulation that extended Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare to individuals on a case-by-case basis might incur some additional costs by allowing greater access to gender affirming treatment.  However, these costs would be justified because they would be only marginally greater than the cost of providing coverage with an age-based restriction.  Further, an amended regulation would avoid other costs that the age restrictions would give rise to and would provide transgender youth with necessary medical care. 1. Removing the Age Restriction Would Impose a Marginal Cost on States That Have Extended Medicaid Coverage for Gender-Affirming Healthcare States may be able to estimate the additional cost of removing the age restriction for gender-affirming coverage.  New York has estimated the cost of extending coverage of gender-affirming healthcare to individuals above the age of eighteen as $6,737,000.353  The estimate was based on the number of Medicaid recipients who receive mental health services with a diagnosis of gender dysphoria                                                                                                                  with their most profound sense of self. They need to give substance to their sense of personal identity; it cannot be a purely inner and silent experience.”).  351. Id.

[Vol. XLIII and the number of those recipients who would seek hormone therapy only, partial gender affirming surgery, or full gender affirming surgery.354  States could conceivably make similar calculations to determine the cost of extending Medicaid coverage to transgender youth. Given the basis of New York’s calculation for the cost of extending Medicaid coverage to transgender recipients over the age of eighteen, it is unlikely that extending coverage to transgender youth would create additional costs beyond what is spent on covering adults.  The WPATH standards also make clear that adolescents experiencing GD still may not be ready or need hormone therapy until they are older.355  Thus, lifting the restriction would not necessarily require the state to cover gender-affirming treatment for all adolescents who experience GD.  In addition, studies suggest that adolescents who experience gender dysphoria most often continue to experience it into adulthood and eventually seek gender-affirming healthcare.356  Removing the restrictions would therefore not add any significant new cost but, rather, would address the needs of transgender Medicaid recipients earlier.  While allowing youth to access gender-affirming healthcare would likely increase the cost to some extent, as there would be greater access to the treatment, this would likely be marginal. 2. Removing the Age Restrictions Would Avoid Other Costs While removing the age restriction would be unlikely to increase the costs of extending coverage to individuals over the age of eighteen, increasing access to gender-affirming healthcare would likely avoid costs incurred by delaying treatment.  Studies indicate that earlier treatment may be more effective at alleviating GD, as individuals have not fully developed the secondary sex characteristics that cause them distress.357  As a result, earlier treatment may prevent necessity for later, more expensive surgical procedures such as gender affirming surgery.358  Therefore, in states such as New York, removing the age restriction might avoid the cost of covering these procedures in some cases, which would be more expensive than early hormone therapy.359                                                                                                                   354.

By treating GD earlier, states would likely see savings related to mental health.360  Mental health experts have noted that the emotional and developmental arrest caused by GD is best treated earlier.361  Therefore, removing the age restrictions might avoid the costs of mental health measures, such as mental health counseling, that might otherwise be incurred where individuals experience GD for a longer period of time.  Additionally, removing the age restrictions on Medicaid coverage would avoid the costs associated with life-threatening behavior, such as suicides and suicide attempts.362  Life-threatening behavior, such as suicide attempts, also present a significant cost to medical centers and local governments.363  Nationally, the economic costs for nonfatal injuries due to self-harm are estimated at $3 billion a year for medical care.364  New York alone reported that treating suicide attempts cost the state around $200 million in 2010.365  Given the statistics that show transgender youth having a higher occurrence of suicide attempts than the cisgender population, it is likely that a reduction in suicide attempts by transgender youth would produce a significant decrease in the state’s costs associated with suicide and attempted suicides.  Research indicates that hormone therapy and gender affirming surgery greatly improve outcomes for transgender youth and reduce the rate of clinical mental conditions.366  Therefore, removing the age restrictions                                                                                                                   360.

While there are cost justifications for extending Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare to transgender youth, any cost incurred by a state may not be dispositive of extending coverage.  The purpose of the Medicaid Act is to help Americans obtain medically necessary treatment that they cannot afford.367  A cost-benefits analysis cannot therefore be determinative of Medicaid coverage.  Rather, the decision to extend Medicaid coverage to gender-affirming healthcare should turn on the recognition that it is medically necessary.  Given that the medical community and federal government recognize that youth may need gender-affirming healthcare, state Medicaid programs should extend coverage of this treatment pursuant to the ultimate objectives of the Medicaid Act.

Legal advocacy organizations, such as LAMDA, the Sylvia Rivera Project, the Legal Aid Society, and the New York Legal Assistance Group, have brought legal challenges to discriminatory practices and policies.376  Courts, in turn, have begun to recognize employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity as violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.377  Activists and allies have brought greater visibility to trans-rights issues by launching powerful direct action and social media campaigns aimed at challenging marginalizing policies, such as gendered public accommodations.378  These changes have come about rapidly, as the APA only reclassified GD so as to remove the label of “disorder” in 2012.  Thus, the trans-rights movement has fundamentally altered public policy and opinions surrounding the rights and lives of transgender individuals. Despite these advances, transgender individuals, and in particular transgender people of color, still find themselves subjected to discrimination, hate, and violence.  In early 2015, advocacy organizations noted a disturbing trend of transphobic hate crimes.379                                                                                                                   union-address-january-20-2015 [https://perma.cc/8U7U-LA9S]); Katy Steinmetz, Why It’s a Big Deal that Obama Said ‘Transgender’, TIME (Jan. 21, 2015), http://time.com/3676881/state-of-the-union-2015-barack-obama-transgender [https://perma.cc/744S-HMUZ] (noting that this was the first time a President mentioned transgender identity in the State of the Union address).  376.

Connor, supra note 1. 138 FORDHAM URB. L.J. [Vol. XLIII correspond with one’s assigned sex at birth, and that individuals, including youth, may experience clinically significant distress termed gender dysphoria.  Despite the fact that medical experts agree that gender-affirming healthcare may be medically necessary for some transgender youth, some states, such as New York, do not extend Medicaid coverage for gender dysphoria for individuals under the age of eighteen.  Age restrictions on Medicaid coverage give rise to possible violations of the Medicaid Act, legal claims under the Affordable Care Act, contradictions with principles of informed consent, and a myriad of negative outcomes.  States could avoid these issues by aligning their programs with the WPATH Standards of Care, and doing so would avoid a number of costs and provide individuals with care that they need but cannot afford. Providing transgender youth with access to affordable transition healthcare, however, would also create a lasting impact on society’s view of transgender identity.  States have already recognized the medical necessity of gender-affirming healthcare for adults, and in doing so have recognized that transitioning is a process that many individuals must go through in order to live happy and functional lives.  By extending this coverage to transgender youth, states would recognize the existence of gender non-conforming youth.  It would encourage private insurers to extend similar coverage, which in turn would motivate healthcare providers, employers, and schools to recognize gender non-conforming youth.  In short, extending Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming healthcare to transgender youth would validate gender non-conforming identities.  While the immediate impact of this validation may be seen in the healthcare that transgender youth receive, the ramifications would likely be seen on a much broader, social level.  ",
