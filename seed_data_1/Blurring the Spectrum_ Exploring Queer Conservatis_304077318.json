From the Log Cabin Republicans to far-right nationalistic \npolitics, queer conservatives underscore both diverging ideologies within the modem \nAmerican conservative tradition and the increase of far-right politics in Western societies. \nThis study argues that queer conservatism, while traditionally less explored in the broader \ncontext of sexuality politics. is consequential to an understanding of the LGBTQ \ncommunity and queer politics. Thus. an exploration of queer conservatism as a political \nideology is explored. in addition to novel quantitative analyses of this community. \nAdditionally. theories are offered to explain the rise of far-right nationalistic views within \nqueer conservatism after the 9/1 l and Pulse nightclub terrorist attacks. This study \nconcludes that. while queer conservatism is a subset of the LGBTQ community. its \nfoundations. legacies. and implications are critical to broader discussions of intersections \nof sexuality. heteronormativity. race. and post-9/11 politics. \n3 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nINTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  5 \nUNDERSTANDING QUEER CONSERVATISM . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  1 1  \nDATA AND ANALYSIS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  32 \nHOMONATIONALISM AND THE QUEER CONSERVATIVE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  .44 \nCONCLUSION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  50 \nWORKS CITED . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  53 \n4 \nLIST OF GRAPHS ANO TABLES \nGRAPH 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ........ 34 \nGRAPll 2 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  41 \nGRAPH 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  42 \nTABLE 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  35 \nTABLE 2 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  38 \n5 \nINTRODUCTION \nOn June 12. 2016. almost 47 years to the day from the LGBTQ rights movement-\nlaunching Stonewall Riots. a lone gunman opened fire on Pulse nightclub, an LGBTQ \nclub in  Orlando. Florida. After the over three-hour long standoff between the gunman, \nfirst responders, and negotiators. forty-nine were dead and fifty-three more were \nwounded - most of whom were the Latinx attendees of that evening's \"Latin Night\" \n(Rothaus 2016; Stolberg and Perez-Pena 2017). The massacre, being the deadliest act of \nviolence against American LGBTQ people, shook deeply not only the queer1 community. \nbut the wider American consciousness as well, as the Pulse massacre was the deadliest \nterror1st attack conducted on US soil since 9/11 and, until the Las Vegas shooting in \n2017, the deadliest mass shooting in American history. \nThough not as common in more contemporary times. violence and disruption \ndirected at queer people in bars, nightclubs. and other gathering spaces holds a lasting \nlegacy for lhe LGBTQ community. For decades during the early to mid-twentieth \ncentury, police raids on largely mafia-owned bars were not uncommon as these \nprotections were never treated as gospel. nor in coffee shops and restaurants where drag \n1 A note on language usage in this paper: the term '\"queer\" is used throughout. Despite \nbeing commonly known as a derogatory term originally used against the LGBTQ \ncommunity. \"'queer'· has gone through a reclamation process by the gender and sexual \nminority community and is now increasingly used within the community. Taken from the \nLGBTQ media monitoring organization GLAAD, queer is generally accepted to mean, \n··An adjective used by some people . . .  whose sexual orientation is not exclusively \nheterosexua1.·· GLAAD also notes: '·Some people may use queer. or more commonly \ngenderqueer. to describe their gender identity and/or gender expression\" (\"GLAAD'\"). \nFinally. GLAAD\"s reference guide also stipulates \"LGBTQ \n.. being the currently accepted \nand preferred acronym for the lesbian. gay. bisexual. transgender. queer. plus, \ncommunity. Because of the diversity of the LGBTQ community, \"queer•· is employed in \nthis study. --Queer\"· is also used to employ the academic sense of the word and non­\nheteronormative analyses present in this work. \n6 \nqueens, transgender people, and other queer folks gathered2 (faderman 2015).  Indeed. the \nStonewall Riots began in the early hours of June 28, 1 969 primarily as a fight against a \npolice raid. And more recently, hate crimes committed against LGBTQ individuals at \nnightclubs have been documented like the 201 4 case of a man setting fire to a Seattle \nnightclub because of his hatred of gays and lesbians (Carter 201 4 ). Regardless of the \nperpetrator's motive, the violence witnessed at Pulse fit entirely too well into the \ncollective memory of the LGBTQ community. \nWhile the attack on Pulse brought kind words and reaffirmations of support for \nthe LGBTQ community from world leaders, politicians. and activists (Chan 201 6; \nGarunay 201 6; Hunt and Jones 201 6), an unusually impassioned response came from \nsome unlikely sorts: conservatives. While many criticisms were levied at right-wing \nreligious leaders' reactions to the shooting (Bever 201 6) and the nwnber of Republican \nCongressmen leaving out the LGBTQ community in their remarks about Pulse (Weigel \n201 6), some on the right were much more explicit in both their mention and support for \nthe LGBTQ community. \nNotably, then-candidate Donald Trump made specific overtures to the queer \ncommunity in his first presidential campaign rally following the shooting. stating: \"We \nwant to live in a country where gay and lesbian Americans and all Americans are safe \nfrom radical lslam, which, by the way, wants to murder and has murdered gays and they \nenslave women\" (Corasaniti 201 6). Trump doubled down on these remarks in his \n2 The queer community and the various mafias had a curious rapport with one another \nduring this time, as the mafias could pay off police officers to ward off potential raids on \ntheir establishments. allowing the LGBTQ community a place of somewhat more security \nthan other establishments they would otherwise attend. \n7 \nnomination acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention - only a few \nweeks after the Pulse shooting - declaring: \"As your president, J will do everything in  my \npower to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful \nforeign ideology\" (Johnson 2016). These remarks were historic in that Trump became the \nfirst Republjcan presidential nominee to offer words of support for the LGBTQ \ncommunity in a nomination acceptance speech. \nYet. Trump was not the only vocal and visible member of the right to comment on \nthe Pulse shooting. the queer community. and radical Islamic terrorism. The alt-right3 and \ngay provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos wrote an article for the right-wing media outlet \nBreitbart the day of the attack titled \"The Left Chose Islam Over Gays, Now 100 People \nAre Dead or Maimed in Orlando'\" ( Yiannopoulos 2016). Meanwhile, other neo-Nazi and \nhistorically homophobic individuals and organizations began spreading Islamophobic \nmessages of support for the LGBTQ community (Falvey 2016). The overt critiques of \nIslam in the comments of Trump. Yiannopoulos. and others on the right cannot be \nunderstated. for they represent one of the most singular ties between traditionally \nhomophobic and transphobic groups. and segments of the LGBTQ community. \nThe increasing political science literature investigating sexuality politics has \nprovided many critical insights into the community. Several studies have highlighted that \nthe majority of the LGBTQ community has traditionally voted Democratic and generally \nidentify as liberal (Black et al 2000; Lewis et al 2011; Perrella et al 2012; Schnabel 2018; \n3 The term \"alt-right\" was popularized by one the movement\"s founders and leading \nmembers Richard Spencer. While still somewhat loosely understood, the alt-right is \ngenerally understood to be those supporting far-right nationalistic, white supremacist, and \nanti-Semitic politics (Stack 2018). \n8 \nSherrill 1996). Other research has considered the interactions of LGBTQ rights issues on \nboth general and LGBTQ-specific voting behavior (Abramowitz 2004; Hi l lygus and \nShields 2005; Lewis 2005; Mulligan 2008; Smith et al 2006). However, due often to data \nlimitations on the political ideologies, thoughts, and behaviors of the community. and the \ngenerally nascent and sometimes zeitgeist-focused nature of sexuality politics, research \non the LGBTQ community has sometimes been l imited in scope and purpose. Too often, \nLGBTQ individuals are treated as variables in social science research instead of being the \nfocus of said research - or, as this study seeks to underscore. the community is treated as \na monolith in our general and academic discussions. \nThus, when seeking to better understand the political beliefs of the LGBTQ \ncommunity. it is necessary to dig beyond first-order questions typified by simple \ndescriptive studies. Exploring queer conservatism is one route to this goal. Queer politics \nhas not been immune to the growing tides of far-right fascination, populism, and \nnationalism over at least the past decade. Research is beginning to note what this tide \nlooks like and how it is impacting broader politics (Bakker et al 2016; Bonikowski 2016; \nSnyder 2003). Evidenced by Trump. Yiannopoulos, and others to be expanded upon. \nmany on the right are evolving their stances on sexuality issues for their political gain, \nand the queer community is doing just the same. Queer conservatism is particularly \nfascinating due to its intersection with beliefs often seen by the mainstream LGBTQ \ncommunity as antithetical to their rights. Additionally, queer conservatism presents a \nnewer and pronounced usage of one's sexuality as a vehicle for politicaJ expression. and \nthe greater complexity with which queer conservatism shades ongoing explorations of \nfar-right populism and nationalism. \n9 \nYet, most importantly. better understanding queer conservatism allows for a better \nunderstanding of the queer community. This community is notably one of the most \ndiverse minority communities with its many intersections of multiple sexualities and \ngenders, as well as racial, class. and certainly ideological distinctions (Ferris 2006). \nObviously, queer conservatism has always existed. However. as will be argued in this \nstudy, even after the founding of conservative LGBTQ political organizations like the \nLog Cabin Republicans in 1978 (the first specifically-conservative LGBTQ political \norganization in the United States; \"Our History\") or GOProud in 2009 (a slightly more \nconservative organization than the LCRs; Zeller 20 l 0). queer conservatism has largely \nbeen left out of both political science and historiographical surveys of the LGBTQ \ncommunity. \nAnother justification comes from the political power held by the LGBTQ \ncommunity and the conservatives within. As Gates (2012) explains in his report for the \nWilliams Institute at UCLA. the 2012 LGBTQ vote was I ikely enough to swing the \nelection in favor of President Obama. as the LGBTQ vote in Ohio and Florida - key \nswing states - appeared enough to push those states into Obama·s corner. This \nimportance is magnified considering 27% of the LGBTQ community voted for .John \nMcCain in the 2008 election (Huang et al 2016 ). Moreover. Donald Trump received only \n14% of the LGBT vote - the lowest vote share among Republican nominees since 1992 \n(Huang et al. 2016). At face value. it appears Trump·s historic inclusion of LGBTQ \nrights in his platform and rhetoric did not help him gain votes from the LGBTQ \npopulation. \nCombining President Trump's historically low vote share among the queer \ncommunity with the rise of more radically nationalist members exemplifies the need to \nbetter understand this segment of the LGBTQ community. Thus, this research proposes \nmost simply the question: \"What does queer conservatism look like?\" Even though the \nquestion may be simplistic, the routes to answering are anything but. \n1 0  \nTo answer, this study is designed as follows: first, queer conservatism as an \nideology is dissected, highlighting the differences between traditional and newer \nnarratives; next findings from quantitative analysis using the 2016 Cooperative \nCongressional Election Study are discussed: then, theories of homonationalism are \noffered for greater context and exploration; and finally, broader discussions surrounding \nthe research question and data are presented. \nA note on source material is important to include. While the foundational research \nfor this study comes from scholarly works, many other sources come from news articles, \nvideo interviews published on YouTube. and other less traditional arenas. Because an \nexamination of queer conservatism requires research on the fast-changing nature of this \nLGBTQ subgroup. and because this subgroup is one not yet frequently explored by \npolitical scientists or other scholars in published works, research outside of traditional \nareas of scholarship is both necessary and important. Every effort has been made to \ninclude reputable news and media outlets, and to approach even biased sources from an \nobjective standpoint. \n1 ] \nUNDERSTANDING QUEER CONSERVATISM \nTo begin exploring the politics of the LGBTQ right, i t  is important first to \nestablish understood definitions. The ideologies discussed in this work are based more in \ncontemporary understandings of conservatism. Focuses on tradition and hierarchy. law­\nand-order, largely Christian oriented, and a heavy importance placed on small \ngovernments are at the root of these ideologies (Schneider 2009). While conservatism in  \nAmerica is  very diverse with deviations like morality-centered Christian conservatives. \nand so-called Country Club Republicans focused mostly on low taxes, fewer regulations. \nand a generally pro-business approach to politics, there are two distinct branches of \nconservatism found within the queer community: neoconservatism and \npaleoconservatism, or what may be more broadly understood as nationalism and the \nideology most often employed by the alt-right. \nNeoconservatism is often defined by spreading traditional American democracy \naround the globe and places a greater importance on US foreign affairs (VaYsse 2010 ). \nPaleoconservatism is broadly understood as those conservatives concerned with the \nprotection of a Western identity through greater economic and political nationalism. a \nrestriction on immigration. and a central focus on traditional social policies and norms \nformulated around religious. ethnic, and national identities (Foley 2007). Scaling back \nUS mil itary intervention abroad often is also encapsulated in paleoconservatism. seen \nthrough many in the Tea Party (Skocpol and Will iamson 2013). \nJust as these splits exist among mainstream conservatism. so too do they occur \nwithin queer conservatism. Thus. in this exploration of queer conservatism. this section \nseeks first to trace the political foundations and evolutions of conservatism within the \n12 \nqueer community. This section will also place the evolutions and ideologies of the queer \nright into a broader frame found within general treatments of the LGBTQ rights \nmovement and its political organizations. Understandably. because the majority of \nLGBTQ people lean towards more liberal ideologies, much of the history and political \ntreatment of the rights movement has focused more on the primarily left-leaning \norganizations like the Human Rights Campaign. Freedom to Marry. the Gay Liberation \nFront, and the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (Faderman 2015; Stryker 2017). \nPolitical differences among left-leaning queer rights groups have existed since \neven the early Homophile movement of the 1950s. Historians and political scientists have \nnoted this distinction as being assimilationist versus liberationist (Faderman 2015: \nRimmerman 2002; Rimmerman 2008). It is exactly this frame. assimilation or liberation. \nwhich can be applied also to the politics and organizations of the queer right. \nRimrnerman (2008) summarizes assimilationist LGBTQ politics as stressing the \ninherent sameness of queer and straight people. Put another way. the only difference \nbetween gay and straight America is the gender of one· s romantic and/or sexual \npartner(s). Moreover, as society generally better understands that sexuality exists on a \nspectrum. this difference is barely one at all. Huntington (2015) perhaps best exemplifies \nthe assimilationist narrative through her dissection of the same-sex marriage fight \nculminating in legalization via the Supreme Court case Oberge_fell , .. Hodges: just like \nheterosexual relationships. same-gender relationships are loving. committed \nrelationships. and same-gender couples possess the same ability as heterosexual couples \nto raise their children. \n1 3  \nConversely. liberationist thinking argues for the acceptance of queer people as a \ndistinct cultural minority. Whaf s more. liberationists identify the most important political \nstruggle as against heteronormativit/ rather than only fighting for civil equality among \nqueer and straight society. This struggle stems from the belief that queer culture cannot \nexist under straight society so Jong as heteronormativity dominates our norms and politics \n(Rimmerman 2008). To simplify. liberationists advocate an accepted difference i n  society \nakin to, though not exactly like, distinctions of race or gender. \nDue to the longer history of the LGBTQ rights movement based primarily on the \nleft. it i s  understandable that the assimilationist and liberationist frame has been well \nestablished in LGBTQ scholarship. Yet, as will be discussed in greater detail below, \nrecent evolutions within queer conservative thinking also fit within this frame. Thus. if \nwe are to understand queer conservatism. it is crucial to understand the ways in which a \nqueer person's sexuality intersects with. informs. and impacts their politics. \nNaturally. this intersection yields different results for different people. So. in \nseeking to better understand the politics of queer conservatism, it is necessary to trace \nthis ideology from the first and largest conservative LGBTQ organization. the Log Cabin \nRepublicans (hereafter '\"LCRs'\"). then turn to the rising levels of right-wing nationalist \nand white supremacist thinking (aka '·alt-right\" thinking) present in queer conservatism. \n4 Schilt and Westbrook define heteronormativity as \"\"the suite of cultural. legal, and \ninstitutional practices that maintain normative assumptions that there are two and only \ntwo genders. that gender reflects biological sex. and that only sexual attraction between \nthese ·opposite· genders is natural or acceptable·· (2009. 441). \n1 4  \nThe Log Cabin Republicans and Mainstream Queer Conservatism \nAs noted above. queer conservatism can generally be understood in two \ncamps - neoconservatism and paleoconservatism. The largest and most pervasive \nversion of queer conservatism is rooted i n  neoconservatism and the conservative \nwave introduced by President Reagan. Take. for example. Guy Benson. a frequent \ncommentator on Fox News and political editor of the conservative webpage and \nmagazine Townhall. Benson argues that his sexuality is only one facet of his \npersonhood. and that he cares more about traditionally conservative values like a \nsmall government. defense of the free market. and a strong mil i tary than he does \nabout defining h is  politics solely on LGBTQ issues ( PragerU 20 1 8 ). This argument \nis one believed and employed by similar LGBTQ conservative thinkers and \ncommentators like Dave Rubin, entrepreneur Peter Thiel. and President of the Log \nCabin Republicans Gregory T. Angelo (Drabold 20 1 6; Lloyd 20 1 6: Riley 20 1 7) .  \nI t  i s  through the Log Cabin Republicans that classical queer conservatism can best \nbe understood. As their website explains, the LCRs began as a fledgling group of gay \nconservatives opposed to what became known as the Briggs Initiative ('\"Our History\"'). \nOfficially known as California Proposition 6, the Initiative. spearheaded by California \nstate senator John Briggs, was a 1978 California referendum which. if passed. would \nhave banned gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools and would have al lowed \nfor the firing of any teacher found to be advocating for or supportive of gay and lesbian \npeople (Rimmerman 2002). The initiative came in the wake of general backlash against \n15 \nthe LGBTQ rights movement when many in the wider public believed exposing children \nto homosexuals could cause the kids to become gay. or that they may contract HIV I AIDS \n(Griffin and Ouellett 2003).  As the LCRs note, initial polling on the initiative showed the \nProposition favored 61 % to 31 % (\"Our History\"). Due to the hesitancy of many \nCalifornian Republicans and Democrats to fight the issue. many gay conservatives, gay \nliberals like Harvey Milk, and their allies rose to the challenge (McKinley 2008). \nSpecifically, gay conservatives in California chose to lobby key policy elites like \nformer Governor and Presidential-hopeful Ronald Reagan. After successful lobbying \nefforts, Reagan wrote a November 151 editorial in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner \nlambasting the Proposition. saying it '·is not needed to protect our children,'' and, \"it has \nthe potential for real mischief. What if an overwrought youngster. disappointed by bad \ngrades, imagined it was the teacher\"s fault and struck out by accusing the teacher of \nadvocating homosexuality? Innocent lives could be ruined .. (Reagan 1978. 19). \nDue to the efforts of these gay activists. Republican and Democrat alike. several \npolitical elites, like Reagan. rallied against the Proposition including former President \nFord. then-Governor Jerry Brown. and eventually. then-President Carter (LeVay and \nNonas 1997). As a result. instead of the Proposition passing 61-31. it failed 58-41. with \nover a million more Californians voting against the Initiative (School Employees 1 978). \nIn response. those gay conservatives officially formed the Log Cabin Republicans (''Our \nHistory .. ). \nSince their inception and subsequent growth, the LCRs have focused on \ntraditionally conservative ideals. As they explain, .. Log Cabin Republicans are LGBT \nRepublicans and straight allies who support equality under the law for all. free markets, \n16 \nindividual liberty. limited government. and a strong national defense\" (\"About Us.'). \nAdditionally, they note that the LCRs ''believe equality for LGBT Americans is in the \nfinest tradition of the Republican Party.'' They \"educate (their] Party about why inclusion \nwins. Opposing LGBT equality is inconsistent with the GO P's core principles of smaller \ngovernment and personal freedom:· In 2012. the LCRs boasted 45.000 members an<l 44 \nchapters (Shapiro 2012� recent membership numbers have proven very difficult to find, \nas the LCRs do not usually publicize these figures). \nThe LCR fight for both traditional Republican values and the inclusion of \nLGBTQ rights within the Republican Party has led the organization to many battles \nlargely within the Republican Party. The LCRs· next major battle post-Briggs Initiative \ncame after Pat Buchanan· s 1992 ''culture war'' speech at the Republican National \nConvention. ln response to Buchanan's statements disparaging LGBTQ rights in what he \ncalled .. a fight for the soul of America\" (Buchanan 1992), and responding more generally \nto President George H. W. Bush· s loss in 1992. the LC Rs increased both their lobbying \nefforts and their attempts to unify the Republican party around a winning strategy (\"Our \nHistory .. ). \nIt was at this point when the operationalization of the LCRs' politics became \nincreasingly succinct. Throughout the 1990s, the LCRs attempted to make in-roads with \nthe Republican establishment. As the LCRs claim. their efforts led to many Republican \nlawmakers and elites such as Governor George Pataki of New York. Los Angeles Mayor \nRichard Riordan and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani becoming \"leading voices of \ninclusion and liberty'· ( .. Our History''). However. their efforts during this decade are \nnotably more complicated than the organization claims. \n1 7  \nThe LGBTQ rights struggle during the 1 990s is often painted as one facing \nintense backlash against not only the general rights movement but broader social equality \nmovements as well (Faderman 2015). The strengthening of the Religious Right over the \ncourse of the 1 980s into the 1 990s led to the sort of ·'culture war'· described by Buchanan \n(Rimmerman 2008). So, to continue increasing their leverage within the party, the LCRs· \nleadership disavowed as well as they could the stereotypical image of the gay community \nduring those decades. \nAs Rogers and Lott (1997) explain, it's unsurprising that throughout the LCRs· \nlobbying Republican elites. the organization frequently drew ''sharp rhetorical boundaries \nbetween themselves and those individuals deemed part of the ·gay establishment\" or \nassociated with libertine l ifestyles, queer theory. or direct action. confrontational politics·· \n(500). This shirking of the image of the sexually liberal and radical gay was seen as an \nadvantage by many in the LCRs during the '90s. One president of the Los Angeles club \nnoted. ·'when [other Republicans] see that we· re sitting at the table and not wearing \nleather jockstraps, their whole image of gays and lesbians will shift\" (Rogers and Lott \n1 997, 500). In  a similar vein are the remarks of Andy Smith, president of the Austin. \nTexas club, emphasizing that the LCRs ·'have to educate people that we are not left-wing. \nearring-wearing liberals\" (Rogers and Lott 1997. 500). And another member of the \nLCRs. Jesse Walters, remarked \"I think [campaign officials] were afraid we were going \nto be a crowd of radical leather men or drag queens\"' (Rogers and Lott 1 997, 500-501 ). \nThe LCRs appeared to have gained even greater victories for inclusiveness \nduring the early 2000s and the election of President George W. Bush. As they note. then­\ncandidate Bush met with a group of gay conservatives. expressed his admiration for \n1 8  \nhearing their stories, and the LCRs note the lack of anti-gay rhetoric in the 2000 general \nelection (\"Our History\"). Moreover, President Bush's 2003 announcement of a$ l 5 \nbillion commitment to combat the global AIDS epidemic was celebrated by the LCRs \n(\"Our History''). Others have noted. however. that Bush's announcement coincided \ncoincidentally with the launching of the Iraq war (Dietrich 2007), and that the President's \nEmergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PREPF AR, included stipulations that up to a third of \nthe $15 billion be reserved for abstinence-only prevention, a method discouraged by \ndoctors and activists involved in the global AIDS epidemic (Cohen 2007). Regardless, \nBush's launching of PREPFAR was seen as a victory among the LCRs. the LGBTQ \nright, and the broader queer community. \nWhile the early years of President Bush's first term appeared somewhat fruitful \nfor the LCRs' mission. by 2003 the optimism smTounding the compassionate \nconservative·s agenda faded. In June 2003. The US Supreme Court struck down Texas· \nsodomy law in the Lawrence v. Texas case. overturning the Court's 1 986 ruling \nupholding Georgia's similar law in Bowers v. Hardwick (Spindelman 2004). And, in \n2004, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in Goodridge v. Department of Public \nHealth that the state's civil marriage laws could not discriminate based on sex. making \nMassachusetts the first state in the country to legalize same-sex marriage (Wegman \n2015). Despite these monumental gains for the LGBTQ community, the public and \npolitical backlash was swift. \nEven before the Lawrence and Goodridge cases, social conservatives sought a \nconstitutional amendment defining marriage as being strictly between a man and a \nwoman (Rimmerman 2008). As the LCRs describe. though President Bush sidestepped \n1 9  \nthe issue of marriage equality and a constitutional amendment in the initial months \nfollowing these high-profile rulings, his appointment of very conservative federal judges \n1 ike the recess appointment of anti-gay Alabama Attorney General Wi Iii am Pryor made it \nclear that Bush would endorse the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA; \"Our History\"). \nHe did just that in February 2004. \ninstead of applying a purely \"sameness\" argument or arguing about the inherent \nnature of same-gender relationships, the LCRs criticized the FMA on what they believed \nare tenants of the Republican Party: a focus on federalism, state autonomy, and liberty \n(\"Our History\"). In response to the Amendment, the LCRs launched a $ 1  million \nlobbying and advertising campaign ( .. Our History\"). With that funding, the LCRs \nconducted a national opinion poll to measure public attitudes about civil unions, same­\nsex marriage. and the proposed FMA. Their data culminated in  an advertising campaign \nwith a television ad featuring Vice President Cheney's rejection of a federal marriage \namendment at the 2000 Vice Presidential Debate, and targeted lawmakers in Washington \nD.C. and key states in 2004 like Missouri, Ohio. Florida. Arizona. and Texas. \nGauging the LCRs· impact on the FMA debate is difficult. Despite spending over \n$ 1  million on the issue and claiming that the House and Senate '\"overwhelmingly \nrejected'' the amendments (\"Our History\"). the final vote tally was 227 to 1 86 in the \nHouse (short of the 290 needed; Musgrave 2004) and 50 against to 48 in favor in the \nSenate (shy of the 60 votes needed; Allard 2004). Even though the FMA was defeated. \nthe debate would prove highly divisive not only for the nation, but for the LCRs as welt. \nIn what was called by many pundits a \"referendum on values\" (Mulligan 2008, \n1 09). the 2004 General Election was the first major outlet for public backlash against \n20 \nLGBTQ rights post-Lawrence and Goodridge. While the impact of moral issues like \nabortion and same-sex marriage has been contextualized and lessened by scholars since \nthe 2004 election (Abramowitz 2004; Hil lygus and Shields 2005), the electoral outcomes \nwere clear. 1 l states ratified marriage amendments to their state constitutions, and \nPresident Bush won reelection (Smith et al 2006). Just as the nation was divided on the \nquestion of same-sex marriage, so were the LC Rs. For the first time since the 1992 \nPresidential Election, the LCRs voted not to endorse the Republican candidate (Anderson \n2004). \nWithholding their support for President Bush ·s re-election did not keep the LC Rs \nfrom continuing their mission of changing attitudes both within and outside of the \nRepublican Party. In 2008, the LCRs endorsed John McCain in that year·s General \nElection largely because of his opposition to the FMA. and they endorsed Romney in \n2012 (Jacobson 2008; '·With Endorsement\" 2012). The LCRs defended their \nendorsement of anti-LGBTQ Romney over President Obama. who had by 2012 expressed \nhis support for same-sex marriage. by emphasizing the '·gravity of the economic and \nnational security issues currently at stake.\" The LC Rs also noted in the press release of \ntheir endorsement their optimism would eventually support the pro-LGBTQ Employment \nNon-Discrimination Act (Shapiro 2012). \nIn 2016. the LCR leadership decided not to endorse any candidate. though their \nPresident Gregory T. Angelo has been very supportive of President Trump since his \nvictory. with Angelo describing Trump as \"the most pro-LGBT Republican president in \nhistory'· (Signorile 2018). This move has understandably been met with some ire. as \nPresident Trump has proposed a ban on transgender Americans serving openly in the \narmed forces and many in his cabinet like Secretary of Education Betsy De Vos and \nSecretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar have invoked religious liberty \narguments allowing the denial of service to individuals with beliefs or l ifestyles which \nmay go against one's religious beliefs - moves deeply concerning to the queer \ncommunity (Signorile 20 I 7). \n2 1  \nNotably. the LCRs have consistently employed much more centrist politics than \nothers in the Party. Rogers and Lott ( 1 997) note that from the early days of the \norganization. the LCRs have professed the guiding Republican principles of a free market \neconomy. individual liberties, and strong foreign policy. Rogers and Lott also add that. \ndespite the \"big tent\" nature of the GOP and their claimed inclusiveness of multiple \nviewpoints. the LCRs have frequently and understandably been at odds with the Christian \nRight. Though the LCRs have never explicitly called the religious right their enemies, \nthey obviously share political differences. Moreover. in 2004. then political director of \nthe LCRs Patrick Guerriero stressed to other LCR members the importance of attending \nthe 2004 Republican National Convention (even though they did not endorse President \nBush) because they needed to \"make it clear that we are loyal Republicans.'' Guerriero \nalso saw the convention as an opportunity to show both the GOP and the country that \nthere are \"thoughtful. conservative gay Republicans.'' Yet. Guerriero also noted that if \nthey do not do so . .. the far right will be able to claim it as their convention\" (Anderson \n2 004). \nThis centrism is evident also in the LCRs· approach to high-profile LGBTQ \nissues throughout their existence. While the LCRs state their core principles are those of \nthe Republican party - a focus on individual liberties. small government. free market \n22 \ncapitalism, and a strong national defense - their lobbying and political efforts exist in a \ngray area between advocating staunchly for these principles while also taking actions \nmore in the traditional center. Take the issue leading to the LCRs' founding, the Briggs \nInitiative. The entire basis for the LCRs' opposition to the law potentially banning \nLGBTQ people from teaching was a privacy argument and individual liberties argument: \nLGBTQ people are perfectly fit to be teachers, and what they do outside of the school \nwalls isn't relevant to their professional ability. This argument can easily be interpreted \nas a classically conservative. civil liberties interpretation of one's right to privacy. \nYet, two of the most important LGBTQ issues of the 2151 century. Don·t Ask. \nDon't Tell (DADT) and the Obergefell v. Hodges case legalizing same-sex marriage, \nhighlight how the LCRs have often moved to more centrist politics. The LCRs \nsuccessfully argued before the federal courts i n  20 I 0 that DADT violated queer service \nmembers· First Amendment rights to free expression and Fifth Amendment rights to due \nprocess (Schwartz 20 I 0). Additionally. the LCRs' partner think tank Liberty Education \nForum filed an amicus brief for the Obergefell v. Hodges case arguing that san1e-sex \nmarriage should be legalized not on the \"sameness\" argument of same-sex loving \nrelationships and parenting as was commonly argued. Instead. Liberty Education Forum \nused discrimination evident in spousal exemptions in campaign donation Jaws - Jaws like \nCitizens United which conservative Justices at the time Alito, Thomas. and Scalia \nsupported - to demonstrate existing discrimination against LGBTQ partners (Nelson \n2015). \nTo be sure. the LCRs approach to these legal challenges fit within the Republican \nframe. Their challenge to DADT was one of furthering constitutional protections for \n23 \nqueer service members, and the Liberty Education Forum· s brief challenged the Supreme \nCourt to apply the decisions it had made to every partnership. hetero or homosexual. \nHowever, the DADT challenge also fits squarely within the \"'sameness'· narrative offered \nby many left-leaning LGBTQ organizations, and the Liberty Education Forum decided to \nmake their campaign donation argument to separate them from so many others making \n\"sameness\" arguments for same-sex marriage and parenting rights. a position they and \nthe LCRs agreed with (Nelson 2015). \nYet, at its core, these challenges, as well as the LCRs' commitment to lobbying \nRepublican elites and attempting to change the party from the inside underscore how the \noperationalization of a group's mission may differ from the ideological core they \nespouse. The LCRs challenged DADT and marriage discrimination in the courts. Many \nothers on the right, especially religious conservatives. have lambasted the Supreme Court \nand other federal and state courts as being fil led with activist judges creating social \nchange without the consent of the democratic populace - though it should be noted these \ncriticisms have been levied against conservative Supreme Court Justices as well (Young \n2002; Schaller 2009). Much of the 2151 century queer rights struggle has been fought in \nthe courts instead of solely through lobbying or changing public opinion (Faderman \n2015). In fighting for greater LGBTQ rights via higher cou11s. the LCRs have often left \nbehind their focus on small government and states· rights in favor of sweeping change \naugmenting the civil rights of their queer constituency. \nFinally, the LCRs have frequently been at odds with the Republican Pa11y's \nplatform. Despite positive words about President Trump from LCR President Gregory T. \nAngelo and Trump's remarks at the 2016 Republican National Convention (Johnson \n24 \n2016), the Republican Party adopted many anti-LGBTQ planks to its 201 6  platform \nincluding reaffirming marriage between a man and a woman, loosely supporting so-called \n\"conversion therapy'' for queer youth. and doubling down on discrimination against \ntransgender people through the .. bathroom bill\" debates (Peters 201 8). Moreover, the \nLCRs have frequently taken a neutral position on other hot button social issues like \nabortion (''Log Cabin·· 1 999; Shapiro 20 I 2a). \nThis centrism has placed the LCRs in the crosshairs of queer conservatism. In \n2009. Christopher R. Barron. then-national political director of the LCRs, and Jimmy \nLaSilva. then-director of programs and policy for the same group. left the Log Cabin to \nform GO Proud. an organization of queer Republicans disillusioned with the centrism of \nthe LCRs (McGum 2009). Although GOProud folded in 20 I 4. the group represented an \nimportant split from the LCRs, who had previously dominated queer right representation. \nGO Proud represented a number of queer conservatives who believed that advocating for \nstricter tax relief and employing a similar ideology to the rising tide of Tea Party \nconservatism would aid both America and specifically the queer community (Shapiro \n2012b). \nAdditionally. GOProud viewed the LCRs· platform as too focused on social \nissues like same-sex marriage. GO Proud was supportive of same-sex marriage. but \nbelieved it to be a matter only for the states to decide. going against the more national \nfocus of the LC Rs (Zeller 2010). Moreover. whereas the LC Rs have traditionally not \ntaken a stance on other social issues like abortion. GOProud was staunchly pro-life \n(McGurn 2009). However. beyond a more state-level focused politics and some \ndeviations on policy. GOProud did not have many grand splits with the LCR. Yet. despite \n25 \nGOProud's relatively short existence, the organization was arguably the first among the \nqueer right to break away from assimilationist, elite-focused actions of the LC Rs. For \nthese reasons. GOProud was an important blip and an even more important precursor to \nwhat would soon follow. \nTile Queer Far-Right and LGBTQ Politics \nShakespeare ·s adage \"misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows·· is perhaps \none of the most apt ways to approach queer individuals on the far right and their \nrelationship with traditionally homophobic, transphobic, and nationalistic organizations. \nIf one were to update Shakespeare's words. the phrase may go something like '\"terrorism \nacquaints a man with strange bedfellows;' for it is almost entirely around the issue of \nradical Islamic terrorism that recent evolutions in queer conservatism is found. This \nexploration into the nationalistic evolutions among queer conservatives begins with a few \ncaveats. \nFirst, because voices among the radical right in queer politics have only recently \ngained attention on the mainstream level. finding and understanding their beliefs is a bit \ndifficult. Additionally. the queer far-right is a small subset of an already small subset of \nthe LGBTQ population. It is likely anywhere between 20 and 30 percent of queer people \nidentify as conservative (Huang et al 2016). In 20 1 7. GaJlup released updated numbers on \nthe American LGBTQ population, estimating 4.3% of adults. or 1 0  million Americans. \nidentify as LGBTQ. Thus. combining these numbers with voting data places the \nestimated queer conservative population between 2 and 3 million Americans. \nYet, despite their size and a lack of hard data on this group, they are nonetheless \nimportant to examine. for the queer alt-right contextualizes both queer and straight \n26 \npolitics. What's more, the performance of one·s sexuality in the political sphere within \nthe queer far-right is as novel as it is important. So, this section will explain the queer far­\nright through the lens of some of its most impo11ant, popular, and impactful practitioners. \nPinning down the specifics of the queer far-right is admittedly difficult. As \nelements of the far-right like the alt-right have risen and popularized. the definition of the \nalt-right has changed as it has solidified. As the Anti-Defamation League explain, core \ntenants of the alt-right specifically include racism and anti-Semitism (\"From Alt Right\"). \nHowever, as the alt-right and its leaders like Richard Spencer rose to prominence, many \nwho are not necessarily racist or anti-Semitic subscribed to the ideology because they \nviewed it as the anti-establishment conservative group. Lucian Wintrich. a prominent far­\nright gay journalist and White House correspondent for the Gateway Pundit. has \nexpressed such beliefs and how he and others like Milo Yiannopoulos no longer associate \nwith the alt-right. Instead, they fall under the category of \"alt-lite\"' ( .. From Alt Righf'). \nThe major difference between the alt-right and alt-lite is that. in the words of alt­\nright writer and white supremacist Greg .Johnson . .. The alt-lite is defined by civic \nnationalism as opposed to racial nationalism\" (\"From Alt Right'l This distinction, while \noften difficult to nail down amongst far-right nationalists, is important to understand \nbecause the queer far-right exists in both camps. Lucian Wintrich and Milo Yiannopoulos \nare perhaps the most popular gay members of the alt-lite. whereas writers and activists \nlike James J. O'Meara and Jack Donovan are popular among the white nationalist alt­\nright (Minkowitz 201 7). \nRegardless of differing beliefs on creating an American or Western ethnostate, the \nqueer far-right shares far more in common than they do disagreements. Opposition to \n27 \nimmigration and Islamic extremism are strong features of this ideology (Minkowitz \n2017).  Additionally. many in the queer far-right take great issue with identity politics and \npolitical correctness. Indeed, so-called PC culture is Yiannopoulos' biggest target. \nMoreover, many in these camps. instead of labeling themselves as conservative, alt-right, \nor alt-lite, often don the term .. cultural libertarian·' (Rubin Report 201 5). This ideology is \noften defined by the belief that people should be free from the dictates of cultural norms, \nthus explaining why issues of political correctness and ideologies challenged generally \naccepted power structures are seen as threatening. Shirking commonly understood or \nmainstream ideological monikers is another facet of both queer and general alt-right or \nalt-lite ideals. \nPart of this phenomenon can be explained by the inherent anti-establishment \nnature of these far-right groups. However. when looking specifically to queer people in \nthese spaces. the fluidity among these political ideals becomes starker. Yiannopoulos, \nwhile never being one to specifically label himself part of the alt-lite, expresses the exact \nviews shared by the group. Moreover. Yiannopoulos has stated that his biggest concerns \nare about pop culture and free speech. but has said the only reason he talks politics is \nbecause of President Trump (Stein 201 6). And in 2016. Lucian Wintrich rose to \nprominence over his controversial photoshoot '·Twinks4Trump\" which featured scantily \nclad. young gay men wearing Trump's '\"Make America Great Again'· hats (Sopelsa \n2017). \nDiscussing the ideologies of far-right queer conservatives is important. but l argue \nnot crucial to understanding the significance and novelty of those like Yiannopoulos and \nWintrich. Just as mainstream conservative queer people have always existed, so too have \n28 \nthose LGBTQ people more far-right inclined. What is new, different. and telling is the \nway many on the far-right utilize their sexuality as a political tool. Moreover. their using \ntheir sexuality as a distinct part of their politics is akin to liberationist thinking as \ndiscussed above. \nEarlier. I noted that the assimilationist and l iberationist frame has been widely \nemployed through both historical and political accounts of the tension among the queer \nleft. Such a tension. though more than likely there in some form. has never been this \nexplicit on the queer right. The Log Cabin Republicans have always fit squarely within \nthe assimilationist camp. By arguing for sameness and equality in civil law while also \nplacing great importance on looking or acting nothing like the stereotypical libertine gay. \nthe LCRs from their founding to present day have employed the same political tactics as \nthe assimilationist. mainstream queer left (Rogers and Lott 1 997; Signorile 201 8). Put \nanother way. the LCRs believe they are already in the .. big tent\" and are only trying to \nmake it that much bigger. \nConversely, the queer far-right see themselves as more anti-establishment. The \nvery fact that they use titles like alt-right and alt-lite instead of Republican is just one \nindication. Moreover. they frequently use their sexuality as justification and as a tool for \ntheir politics. Yiannopoulos has criticized same-sex marriage not with a religious \nargument or one seeking to maintain the social hierarchy of heterosexual marriage. \nInstead. Yiannopoulos has been against same-sex marriage because to him. being queer is \na license to break away from the mainstream and live a freer lifestyle (Rubin Report \n2015). Or in other words. Yiannopoulos argues for queerness. free speech. and free \nsociety as a place for gay people to live outside of heteronormative assumptions. Rather \n29 \nthan advocating for LGBTQ people·s strict inclusion i n  society. Yiannopoulos and others \nview their queerness as defining their personhood and politics. and because society in  \nmany ways still etherizes the LGBTQ community. queer people have greater freedom to \nexplore l ife, politics, and interactions with society in ways traditionally associated with \nbeing abnormal. \nLucian Wintrich also serves as an example of using one· s sexuality to advocate \nfor conservative politics. Wintrich is a staunch Trump supporter and free speech advocate \nwho gained his notoriety through the controversial and highly sexualized \n\"Twinks4Trump\" photoshoot, a photoshoot he was later fired for (VICE News 201 7). \nInstead of featuring gay men in the classic suit and tie - in other words, Log Cabin \nRepublicans - Wintrich uses blatant queer overtones to advocate a political message. It is \nin the performance and operationalization of the queer far-right\" s politics that place them \nvery much in the vein of liberationism. \nThe debates between assimilationism and liberationism on the left have largely \ndefined how the LGBTQ rights struggle has operated (Rimmerman 2008). Whether it be \nthe assimilationists lobbying political elites for change or fighting most of the legal battle \nin the courts, or the liberationists using more direct-action protest tactics. the history of \nthe LGBTQ rights movement in the United States has exemplified the success of \nassimilationist tactics (Faderman 2015 .  What remains to be seen now is the ways in \nwhich the queer far-right and their more liberationist anti-establishment views play out \ntheir political struggle. The LCRs have made inroads within the GOP through their \nlobbying efforts and they played a key role in overturning DADT through their legal \nchallenge. Yet. the nascence of the queer far-right leaves more questions than predictions. \n30 \nIt is important to point out that. o�jectively. the LCRs helped open the door for queer \npeople·s acceptance in the far-right. However. because of the far-right's anti­\nestablishment beliefs, there is much tension between the queer far-right and mainstream \nqueer conservatives beyond core policy priorities. \nThe similarities between the queer liberationist left and right cxi::;t onJy in the \nways they frame their sexuality as political and treat the idea of queer existence in \nsociety. The liberationist left like the Gay Liberation Front emerged during the explosive \nrise of the gay rights movement after the Stonewall Riots in 1 969, and their main cause \nwas queer liberation (Faderman 2015). The ideological priorities of the queer far-right are \ntied much more to their general political beliefs than on a single issue like civil \nprotections. The alt-right and similar organizations only began courting likeminded queer \nconservatives after the Obergefell v. Hodges case legalizing same-sex marriage in 201 5  \n(\"Youth .. 2015). Simply put. the queer far-right has risen more so after the major rights \nbattles were won. So. while the queer far-right's main political objectives may not be \nsolely about LGBTQ politics. they do benefit from a smaller barrier to entry and a far­\nright movement whose leaders at least want them in the fold. \nFinally. because so much of the queer far-right's politics are wrapped in the \ncurrent wave of populist nationalism. the movement generally has suffered growing \npains. The split between the alt-right and the alt-lite underscores the instability still \nsomewhat prevalent among this wing of conservatives. How long the nationalist \nmentality will exist in American politics is unknown. The important question when \nthinking about the LGBTQ people in the far-right is whether their sexual politics will \nevolve as nativist debates continue raging, and if they will linger or change entirely \nwhen/if the nationalistic pendulum swings the other way? \n3 1  \n32 \nDATA AND ANALYSIS \nAnalyzing the rhetoric and purported beliefs of queer conservatives is only one \nway to explore the range of political thought among this subgroup. Quantitative analysis \nof their demographic breakdowns and political opinions helps complete the picture. In \nthis section, I will utilize the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. The CCES \ndataset from 2016 provides a unique insight into the LGBTQ community, as its inclusion \nof sexual orientation and gender identity questions lends a sample of 5,1 1 7  self-identified \nLGBTQ people out of the 64,600 respondents. This sample is one of the largest ever of \nqueer people, allowing for statistical validity when one moves beyond simple \ndemographic measures of the community. Until the 2016 CCES data, most quantitative \nstudies surveying LGBTQ people's politics either had samples not large enough to move \nconfidently beyond first-order questions and/or they did not include transgender \nrespondents (Black et al 2000; Gates 20 1 1 ;  Lewis et al 201 1 ; Sherrill 1996). \nTherefore, the 2016 CCES set is useful, important, and insightful as researchers \nestablish a more up-to-date picture of the LGBTQ community (specifically the \nconservatives) and make inferences about queer conservatism. This section begins with a \ndescription of the methods used, starting first with demographic data of both the general \nLGBTQ population and the queer conservative sample, then reports political attitudes \namong queer conservatives, before finally presenting important findings from regression \nand the general analyses. \nAs noted above, the CCES dataset includes separate questions asking about the \nrespondent's sexual orientation and gender identity. Often, concerns can be raised about \nthe accurate representation of LGBTQ people in survey samples, as disclosing this \n33 \ninformation can sometimes be risky or uncomfortable for the respondent. The Williams \nInstitute at UCLA, which works exclusively on LGBTQ political and legal issues, has \npublished a best practices guide for sampling LGBTQ people (Badgett 2009). The guide \nnotes that providing secure and private environments for the survey frequently increases \nthe rate of accurate self-identification. As Ansolabehere and Schaffuer (2016) explain in \nthe 2016 dataset's guidebook, all 64,000 respondents were sampled via the internet, thus \nlessening potential concerns about accurate self-reporting. \nIn creating a dataset for queer conservatives, a decision was made to use the \nCCES set's 5-point political ideology question instead of the 7-point party identification \nquestion. This decision was made for two reasons: first, there is obviously a difference \nbeen self-identified political ideology and self-identified party affiliation (Abramowitz \nand Saunders 1998; Greene 2004; Weinschenk 2010). One does not naturally preclude \nsupport for the other. Second, when one compares the ideology versus the party \naffiliation of the LGBTQ community, the results become very mixed. As Graph 1 below \nshows, once one moves past the expected Strong Democrat and Very Liberal correlation, \nthere are strong pockets of independents as well as curious outliers such as \nSomewhat/Very Conservative and Strong Democrat (4,1 and 5,1). \nTherefore, the political ideology question was utilized for consistency and \nbecause, as noted in the previous section, differences exist between the queer right's \nideology and their support of the Republican Party. So, to analyze the LGBTQ \nrespondents in the 201 6  CCES dataset, three separate datasets were created. The first \ncombined the two questions on sexual orientation and gender identity to create a set of \nLGBTQ respondents, totaling 5,1 17. Next, an independent sample of only conservative-\n34 \nidentifying LGBTQ respondents was created. That sample size is 745. Finally, a general \ndata set of all respondents identifying as conservative on the political ideology scale was \ncreated for comparison, totaling 1 8,688 people. \nGraph 1 \n6 -\nc: \n0 \n'.;::; \n('j \n0 \n;;:: '.;::; \nc: 4-Cl> \"O \n£ ro \na.. \n? -\n. .

These demographics include age, race, gender, education level, family \nincome, marital status, importance of religion, church attendance, and religious \naffiliation.

First, the sample of \nLGBTQ conservatives are predominantly white men, with 74% of the respondents being \nwhite and 65% male. Compared to the general conservative sample, there is more \ndiversity among race but fewer women, as the general conservative sample is 8 1  % white \nbut split 5 1 -49 male and female. When comparing these levels with the general LGBTQ \npopulation, one finds there are fewer white people in the sample, 69%, but the gender gap \nis also quite distinct, with 60% men and 40% women. \nThe age range is also interesting to note. Even accounting for the slight spike of \n25-34 year olds in the conservative queer group, there is a decently even split among the \nage ranges. The age spread among the general LGBTQ population is fairly similar, with \nthe same spike occurring around 25-34 year olds and remaining around 1 5-20% through \nthe remaining ages. However, there notable differences between the queer and general \nconservative groups. The general conservative sample includes only 4.5% in the 1 8-24 \nrange, 13% for both the 25-34 and 35-44 ages, a slight spike of 17% for those 45-54, and \n51  % of the sample makes up those 55 and older. Social attitudes against homosexuality \nduring the lives of the older members of the conservative population could be one reason \nwhy there are so fewer older queer conservatives. Yet, collapsing the older respondents in \nthe queer conservative set to 55 and up brings a total of 32%, creating a wider age gap \nsimilar to the general conservative sample. \nTurning next to the religion statistics, it is unsurprising to find the majority of \nqueer conservatives reporting Christian denominations. Both the importance of religion \nand church attendance rates are added to measure the religiosity of the sample. Church \nattendance is especially important to include, as it is often a better explainer of the impact \n37 \nofreligion on a person's politics (Malka et al 2012). Interestingly, the level of the \nimportance of religion in queer conservatives' lives is significantly higher than that \nreported by the general LGBTQ population, with 80% of conservative queers reporting \nvery or somewhat importance whereas only 50% of the general LGBTQ population rank \nreligious importance similarly. But when we compare the queer conservatives with the \ngeneral conservative sample, significantly similar results emerge. 82% of the general \nconservative sample rate religion as very or somewhat important in their lives. \nFinally, the fascinating mix of conservative political ideologies and Democratic \nParty affiliation is shown in the party identification scale. 27% of this sample identifies as \na strong Democrat, compared to the almost identical rate for those identifying as a strong \nRepublican. Expectedly, more respondents identify as some level of Republican. But, the \nnumber of those identifying as strong Democrats is even slightly stronger than those \nidentifying as strong Republican. Attempting to establish a reason for this phenomenon is \nbeyond the scope of this research, though an early assumption would be those identifying \nas both conservative and strong Democrats perhaps treat LGBTQ issues as their single \nissue, therefore identifying with the Democrats and their more pro-LGBTQ platform than \nthe Republicans. \nAlso included in the CCES data set are opinion questions asked of every \nrespondent. Though they are only in a favor/oppose format, they cover several \ncontroversial political issues. Out of the 24 questions covering gun control, immigration, \nsocial issues, and environmental regulations, seven were chosen. These seven were \nselected for both their relevance in the 2016 election cycle and because they are \nfrequently major departure points among liberals and conservatives. The questions as \n38 \nwell as the responses from the conservative LGBTQ respondents are detailed in Table 2 \nbelow. \nTable 2 \nQueer Conservatives: Favor/Oppose ... • N = 745 Gen.

Taking all questions into account, the queer conservative \nsample appears somewhat centrist to liberal on strict social issues like abortion and same-\nsex marriage, but also shows their conservative lean regarding immigration. The support \n39 \namong queer conservatives for requiring background checks on all gun purchases is fairly \nconsistent with other respondents in the CCES data set, as well as national polling. 92% \nof the LGBTQ sample favors background checks, as do 8 1  % of the general conservative \nsample. And in 2017, the Pew Research Center found 84% of Americans favor \nbackground checks for private sales and at gun shows (Igielnek and Brown 2017). \nAlso on guns, queer conservatives do not differ much from straight conservatives \nwhen it comes to banning assault rifles. 43% of the latter group favor such weapons \nversus the 56% opposed. The Pew Research Center notes 68% of Americans favor \nbanning assault weapons. The general LGBTQ populace, however, highly favors banning \nthese weapons with 73% supporting the proposal. \nOn immigration, only 27% of the general conservative sample supports granting \nlegal status to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as \nminors, also known as DREAMers after the proposed DREAM Act to grant them a path \nto citizenship. Conservative LGBTQ people are only a few points more in favor of this \nproposal, and 55% are in favor of identifying and deporting undocumented immigrants, \nwhile 65% of heterosexual conservatives support such a proposal. The general LGBTQ \nsample shows the highest support for undocumented migrants, with 60% favoring \ngranting legal status to DREAMers and only 27% support identifying and deporting \nundocumented immigrants. \nIt is on the issues of abortion and same-sex marriage where queer conservatives \ndifferentiate greatly from both the general LGBTQ population and the general \nconservative sample. Only 32% of heterosexual conservatives support always allowing \nabortion as a matter of choice, versus 52% of the queer conservatives and 77% of the \ngeneral queer sample. Similarly, 6 1  % of straight conservatives support abortion only in \ncases of rape, incest, and concerns for the mother's life, whereas 66% of queer \nconservatives support such a proposal but only 3 7% of the LGBTQ sample do. The \nopposition from the general LGBTQ sample may be because the question asks if they \nsupport abortion only in the instance of rape, incest, and the life of the mother. \n40 \nThe most startling statistic of the opinion questions, however, is the queer \nconservative response to same-sex marriage support. 39% oppose such a proposal. There \ndoes exist among LGBTQ folk some opposition to same-sex marriage, largely because \nthey either care more about the legal benefits of the unions, or because they view \nmarriage as patriarchal and heteronormative (Geoghegan 2013). The former argument \ncould be at the root of many of those conservative LGBTQ people opposed to same-sex \nmarriage, as respect for marriage as a foundation of society is often an accepted tenant of \nconservatism. Indeed, this argument has been used to support same-sex marriage from a \nconservative viewpoint (Angelo 2015; Rauch 2013). Similarly, Geoghegan notes that \nmany gay couples are concerned more with some form of legal recognition to take \nadvantage of spousal tax and legal benefits, making civil unions just as useful (2013). It \nseems unlikely, however, that one would find arguments against marriage as patriarchal, \nmisogynistic, and heteronormative among queer conservatives as such an argument has \nlargely only been found among more radical, liberationist, left-wing queer activists \n(Rimmerman 2008). \nTo derive a possible explanation for this opposition, a simple linear regression \nwas conducted, the results of which are detailed in Graph 2. The support/oppose same­\nsex marriage question was tested against common demographic factors often associated \n41 \nwith political beliefs such as age, race, gender, education, and income levels. \nInterestingly, age is the only statistically significant independent variable. Given that the \nage range among the conservative queer sample is decently stratified with strong spikes \namong both younger and older members of the group, this outcome is especially curious. \nThis range is highlighted in Graph 3. With 74% of the sample being white, it makes sense \nrace would not be significant in the model. Yet, the spreads among gender, education, \nand income are more like the age spread than the racial demographics. \nGraph 2 \nage-2 -\nrace1 -\nfamin�1 • \nI \nJ__ \n• \nI \n0.0 \n• \n• \n• \nI \n0.2 O . .! 0.6 \nEach variable is numbered to signify its scaling for regression analysis. \"Famine\" is \nfamily income, and \"educ \" is highest level of education achieved. \nThe magnitude of increase on the age variable is also worth mentioning. Not only \nis the variable very significant, but its increase shows that as one moves up in age the \n42 \nmore likely they are to oppose same-sex marriage. By identifying as either somewhat or \nstrongly conservative, the queer right-wing in this dataset are likely to be more inclined \nalready to oppose same-sex marriage, possibly for reasons explained above like states' \nrights issues or redefining marriage. Augmenting these political beliefs are the societal \nattitudes towards queer people as the older generations of queer conservatives were \ncoming of age and being socialized politically, to say nothing of attitudes towards same-\nsex marriage. \nGraph 3 \nAge of Conservative Queer Respondents \n30 -\nrn -\nc \nID \n� 2C: -\no \n0.. \n00 \nQ) \n0:: \n-\n0 \no -\n20 60 \nAge \nIIJ \n80 \nUnfortunately, because the CCES dataset was not designed specifically for queer \nrespondents, we have little hard data to explain in further detail why conservative queer \nfolk believe what they do. This is a limitation to address in future studies. However, what \n43 \nthe data do present is a larger picture than ever of conservative LGBTQ people's \ndemographics and political beliefs. On aggregate, they look similar in many ways to both \nthe LGBTQ population and straight conservatives. Intellectually, it is not hard to wrap \none's head around the notion that not all queer people think the same and that the \nmainstream left-leaning LGBTQ rights movement is not a monolith. This data offers for \none of the first times quantifiable justification to believe there are important similarities \nand differences between queer conservatives, the general queer community, heterosexual \nconservatives, and the American population at large. \n44 \nHOMONATIONALISM AND THE QUEER CONSERVATIVE \nAs has been argued throughout this study, the queer community does not exist nor \nthink like a monolith. Simply because many LGBTQ people identify as liberal and as \nDemocrats does not mean that the entire community agrees. Yet, when trying to ascertain \nthe reasoning behind queer conservatism or explain the rise of far-right beliefs within the \nqueer community, shrugging off the phenomenon as stemming from a simple diversity of \npolitical opinion does not suffice. As has been noted previously, the evolutions among \nthe queer right are as important and consequential as the debates existing among the \nqueer left, and no change in political socialization or attitude happens in a vacuum. \nTherefore, a broader explanation is necessary to truly attempt to understand the \nqueer conservative, especially in a post-Obergefell America. To answer, I suggest Jasbir \nPuar's theory of homonationalism (2007). At its core, homonationalism describes the \nfavorable relationship between nationalistic, specifically Islamophobic, ideologies and \nthe LGBTQ community. One of the keys to this broader theme is the intersection \nbetween the queer community, post-9/1 1 foreign policy and national defense, and anti­\nIslamic conservative politics. \nSince the terrorist attacks on September 1 1, 200 1 ,  right-wing advocates, \npoliticians, and pundits have been using the threat of radical Islamic terrorism to bridge \nhistoric divides between the LGBTQ community and the right, and to gain more \nsupporters from the queer community. Specifically, these advocates are among groups \nlike the alt-right and other white supremacist and nationalistic organizations. Since 2015, \nfounder of the alt-right Richard Spencer has been making specific overtures to the \nLGBTQ community, and these efforts have only increased since the Pulse shooting \n45 \n(Falvey 2016; \"Youth\" 2015). Additionally, both the leaders of these movements and \ntheir supporters cite the killings of LGBTQ people at the hands ofradical groups like the \nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL and those affiliated with radical Islamic \nterrorist organizations as evidence that Islam is incompatible with Western values like \nprotecting LGBTQ rights (Greenwald 20 1 6). \nHowever, while tragedies like the killing ofLGBTQ people at the hands ofISIS \nand the Pulse nightclub shooting are jarring and emotionally compelling, these incidents, \nwith hindsight, have proven to be more exaggerated and sensationalist than originally \nassumed. OutRight Action International, one of the leading international LGBTQ human \nrights organizations, tracked the number of ISIL confirmed killings of queer people from \n2014 to 2016. Their research found that 90 LGBTQ people were killed by ISIS fighters in \nthat two-year span, though it should be noted that they included in their findings the 49 \npeople killed in the Pulse shooting (\"Timeline\" 2016). Removing the Pulse shooting \nbrings their total to 4 1 .  While the killing of anyone is tragic, 90 murders over the span of \ntwo years does not strike this researcher as actual evidence for an epidemic. \nMeanwhile, the Pulse shooting itself provides still greater context to the \ndifference between compelling political and emotional narratives and the reality of these \nevents. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, media pundits, activists, and \npoliticians whipped up a flurry of theories and explanations for the shooting. Within \nhours, a cohesive narrative immerged: because the shooter allied himself with ISIL, and \nbecause Pulse is an LGBTQ club, the shooter purposefully chose to target queer people. \nSimply put, the shooting was a hate crime (Greenwald 201 6). \nAdditional speculation came in the form of the common trope of the sexually \nconfused and frustrated closeted gay man. Patrons of Pulse claimed to have seen the \nshooter at the nightclub on a few occasions (Brinkmann 2017). And, the shooter's ex­\nwife claimed she had wondered about the shooter's sexuality while they were married, \nsaying: \"He would take a long time in front of the mirror, be would often take \npictures of himself, and he made little movements with his body that definitely \nmade me question things\" (Alter 201 6). \n46 \nAnd yet, despite these theories becoming the assumed motive of the \nshooter, recent findings have proven these theories to be more conspiratorial than \nfact. During the trial for the shooter's second wife (she was accused of knowing \nabout the attack days before it happened), evidence from the FBI revealed there to \nbe no factual evidence that any of the suggested motives were genuine (Greenwald \nand Hussain 201 8). The FBI revealed that at no point during the hours-long \nstandoff at Pulse did the shooter ever spout homophobic justifications, nor is it \nbelieved the shooter even knew Pulse to be a queer club prior to the attack \n(Fitzsimons 2 0 1 8).  Rather, the shooter cited US military affairs in the Middle East \nas his main justification. And, evidence from the night of the assault confirmed the \nshooter had originally intended to attack Disney resorts, only to find them too well \nprotected (Greenwald and Hussain 201 8). \nAs noted above, the Pulse massacre has been one of the most widely cited \nincidents of radical Islamic terrorism used as a form of propaganda to bring queer \npeople into the right-wing fold. President Trump's high profile remarks on \nprotecting LGBTQ Americans stems entirely from this line of thinking, as does the \n47 \njustification for greater restrictions on Muslims in America and Western Europe. \nAlice Weide!, the openly-lesbian leader of the far-right Alternative for \nDeutschland (AID) party in Germany referenced the attack in ber campaign rallies \nand as justification for a lesbian leading a party whose members are generally anti­\nLGBTQ (Vlad 2 0 1 7). Additionally, leader of the French far-right party the \nNational Front Marine Le Pen has employed the same anti-Muslim rhetoric in \novertures to the French LGBTQ community (Wildman 2 0 1 7).  \nPuar defines homonationalism as the \"transition under way in how queer \nsubjects are relating to nation-states, particularly the United States, from being \nfigures of death (i.e.,  the AIDS epidemic) to becoming tied to ideas of life and \nproductivity (i .e.,  gay marriage and families)\" (2007, xii).  Tn other words, \nhomonationalism describes how political and power interests align with general \nLGBTQ equality to advance xenophobic positions under the guise that foreigners, \nspecifically Muslims, are supposedly homophobic and are thus incompatible with \nthe superior egalitarianism of the West. \nRecall President Trump's overtures to the LGBTQ community during his \nnomination acceptance speech: \"As your president, I will do everything in my power \nto protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign \nideology\" (Johnson 20 1 6). Trump's rhetoric, like that of far-right leaders and polemicists \nlike Richard Spencer, Jack Donovan, and Milo Yiannopoulos, bases his support for the \nqueer community as entirely against a foreign ideology. While he never explicitly \nmentions Islam, remember also that Trump's nomination came only weeks after the Pulse \nshooting. \n48 \nOf course, homonational.ist overtures to the queer community have existed \nprior to the Pulse shooting. Chavez (20 1 5 )  notes that queer support for \nimmigration reform via the 1 990 Immigration Act spearheaded by the openly gay \nCongressman Barney Frank led some on the right to blame Frank and the .. gay \nagenda\" for the September 1 1 th attacks (Chavez 2 0 1 5).  However, a combination of \nincreased LGBTQ rights (and thus greater inclusion of queer people in American \nsociety), the rise of extreme terrorist groups like ISIS, and the Pulse shooting have \npushed homonational ist justifications to the fore. \nPuar explains in her foundational book Terrorist Assemblages that as queer \npeople move from being maligned in society for their personhood or because of \nreactions to the AIDS epidemic, they wil l  naturally take a more mainstream hold \nin society (2007). With increasing inclusion in the mil itary (tbe main defense \nagainst terrorism), greater civi l  protections. and the right to marry and adopt \nchi ldren, queer people have moved to this position postulated by Puar. Thus, as \nPuar argues, as queer people, especially those of privilege like white gay men, are \nincluded more in society, they will  naturally become more concerned with the \nwellbeing of the state and the society in which they have adopted and has adopted \nthem. \nAs pointed out in the previous section, the overwhelming majority of queer \nconservatives are white men. Not only are they the first to be included in the \npolitical society which once excluded them (Schotten 20 1 6), but they are the \nperfect candidates for nationalist politics either explicitly or implicitly advocating \nfor white supremacy at most, and Western/American exceptionalism at best. The \n49 \nsynthesis of increasing queer rights and backlash against the replacement outgroup \nfor the LGBTQ community, Muslims, is exemplified in the remarks expanded \nupon previously by both queer far-right conservatives and heterosexual \nnationalists appealing only to a queer person 's right to life. \nOf course, homonationalism has its faults. It is not a catch-all theory for \nevery queer conservative. However, as I have argued, queer conservatism has \nalways existed, and even when it finally became public with the advent of the Log \nCabin Republicans, it has existed solidly in traditional conservative thinking. The \nnovelty of the evolving far-right queer conservative is best explained through \nhomonationalism, and the many ways increasing populist nationalism bas \ninfluenced American political thought is also exemplified through the queer far­\nright conservative. \nUnfortunately, the interplay between bomonationalism and queer \nconservatism is difficult to document. However, since the Pulse shooting, there \nhas been enough evidence to apply this theory originating from queer theorists to \npolitical science interpretations of changing political beliefs. I argue it is only \nthrough an intersectional approach of traditionally understood demographic \ninfluences on political ideologies and the broader national conversation \nsurrounding conservatism, terrorism, queer rights. and the inclusivity of all in a \nbroader American soc iety can we truly understand the origins and influences of \nqueer conservatism. \n50 \nCONCLUSION \nDespite the increasing influence of queer Americans on the political \nLandscape and the growing research explaining these political phenomenon, I have \nargued that not enough attention has been paid to queer conservatism. Tracing its \norganizational lineage through the Log Cabin Republicans to growing numbers of \nfar-right LGBTQ conservatives, this study has documented the many shades of \nqueer conservatism. Furthermore. data analysis has provided with some of the best \ndata available a detailed snapshot of not only the general makeup of LGBTQ \nconservatives, but some of their political beliefs as well .  Finally, a broader \nexplanation of rising far-right queer conservatism was offered through the theory \nof bomonationalism. \nThis research has not been an attempt to describe in every way queer \nconservatism or act as a historical analysis. Rather, the guiding purpose behind \nblurring this spectrum is to chip away at a segment of the queer community often \nless explored but still critical to the understanding of queer politics. Findings from \nthis research underscore two important. though perhaps obvious conclusions. First, \nqueer conservatives share many similarities between both the general (that is to \nsay, left-leaning) LGBTQ population as well as the mainstream conservative \nmovement. Second, queer conservatism, like queer politics generally, are quite \ncomplex and thus deserving of greater exploration. \nThese complexities and this research offer important implications. One of \nthe most frequent criticism heard from queer conservatives is that it  is harder to \ncome out as queer and conservative than it is to come out as queer (\"'Gay \n5 1  \nJournalist\" 201 7). I f  it  appears this study bas been overly critical of the current \nstate of research on the full spectrum of sexuality politics, it is unintentional. \nInstead, the criticisms and arguments offered here are meant to shed light on a part \nof queer politics needed in every level of research into sexuality politics. \nSecond, queer conservatism cuts to the core of our understanding of \npolitical socialization. Though not previously discussed, some researchers believe \nthe \"coming out\" process may be its own form of political socialization - or in \nmany cases, re-socialization. Coming out as queer can lend itself to a recalibration \nnot only of political beliefs but also the communities i n  which queer people find \nsupport (Avery 2002; Egan 2 0 1 2 ). Additionally, it's believed the process of a \nqueer person finding support within their conception of the queer community may \nreorient their political compass to be more like those i n  their community, thus \npossibly explaining why so many in the queer community are left-leaning besides \nsimple party identification. H owever, if we understand queer conservatives to go \nthrough the same coming out process, how does the coming out process, and \npolitical socialization generally, account for the noticeable number of queer \nconservatives? \nAbove all,  however, the interactions between the queer community and far­\nrigbt political ideologies highlights the extent to which ideologies, especially \nreactionary ones, can influence the politics of a society. I f  anything. this research \nunderscores the importance of taking the politics and influences of sexuality -\nboth heterosexual and queer - into general and specific accounts of changing \npolitical trends. The political cJout of the queer community is well documented \n(Black et al. 2000; Faderman 2 0 1 5; Gates 2 0 1 1 ;  Huang et al 20 1 6).  I f  we are to \nbetter understand the intersections impacting the political sphere of human \nbehavior, it is imperative we include every stop along that road. \n52 \n53 \nWORKS CITED \nAbramowitz, Alan I., and Kyle L.

    "abstract": "Running parallel to the groundbreaking and historic advancement of LGBTQ rights over the past decade has been the rise in the prominence and public discourse of queer conservative thinking. From the Log Cabin Republicans to far-right nationalistic politics, queer conservatives underscore both diverging ideologies within the modern American conservative tradition and the increase of far-right politics in Western societies. This study argues that queer conservatism, while traditionally less explored in the broader context of sexuality politics, is consequential to an understanding of the LGBTQ community and queer politics. Thus, an exploration of queer conservatism as a political ideology is explored, in addition to novel quantitative analyses of this community. Additionally, theories are offered to explain the rise of far-right nationalistic views within queer conservatism after the 9/11 and Pulse nightclub terrorist attacks. This study concludes that, while queer conservatism is a subset of the LGBTQ community, its foundations, legacies, and implications are critical to broader discussions of intersections of sexuality, heteronormativity, race, and post-9/11 politics",
