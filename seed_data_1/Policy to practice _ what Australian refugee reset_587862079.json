Declarations This thesis was completed as part of a Master’s program funded by the US-Australia Fulbright Commission, specifically the Anne Wexler Scholarship in Public Policy. Additional funding was provided by the Lois Roth Foundation for the distribution of research findings, including a report for communities and practitioners and two workshops to facilitate the release of the report. This thesis has been professionally edited by Editing Press, which gave a partial fee waiver        through the Laura Bassi Scholarship. The edits consisted of general proofreading for spelling, grammar and clarity and were made in accordance with Western Sydney University policy titled The Editing of Research Theses by Professional Editors and The Institute of Professional Editors Limited Guidelines for editing research theses (revised 25 February 2019). The editor did not make corrections to the content, substance or structure of the thesis.  This research sits within an academic context of a Master of Research Degree, however its primary purpose is pragmatic. My purpose for researching issues that impact queer refugees and asylum seekers is to fill the gap in my own understanding, and that of my colleagues, about how to change systems that are failing people who live in the intersections of queerness and displacement. The application of the research is ultimately geared towards informing social change. This Master’s thesis seeks to amplify the voices of people in refugee spaces in an academic format while understanding that the privileging of academic knowledge over voices of lived experience is inherently oppressive. Academic research should not be considered a substitute to listening to voices of lived experience.   i Table of Contents  DEDICATION ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS STATEMENT OF AUTHENTICATION DECLARATIONS TABLE OF CONTENTS .................................................................................................................................................

practice that impacts queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia, intersections that are not well addressed in existing migration policy or research. It builds on a growing area of research around the needs of queer refugees and asylum seekers, who are marginalized within policy and settlement services globally. It adopts a methodological lens informed by queer theory, peace theory, and intersectionality to explore mechanisms of power and resistance, queerness and displacement in Australia. Data collection tools include discourse analysis, policy review and interviews with service providers working with queer refugees or asylum seekers to identify ways these discourses or power and resistance are materialized in practice. The thesis argues that the cis-heteronormative assumptions underpinning global migration systems create contexts of marginalization and axiomatic violence for queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia. Exclusions and the punitive conditions imposed on queer refugees and asylum seekers create vulnerability to exploitation and criminalization. The thesis finds a need for: an intersectional approach to resettlement in refugee and asylum seeker policy; greater emphasis on training on inclusive practice and trauma-informed communication; re-negotiating power relationships between providers and clients; the inclusion of queer people with lived experience in policy-making; greater investment in peer-led community groups; and a departure from contracted service models. There is a need for service providers to participate in shaping more peaceful and improved outcomes for queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia. The thesis findings align with existing research, primarily from North America, that identifies the exclusion of queer refugees and asylum seekers from support systems. The thesis contends that practicing healing  v and safety creation in everyday interpersonal interactions, and working for structural change, will complement each other to deliver improved outcomes for queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia.       1   Chapter 1: Introduction Under Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 10 December 1948 , “everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries freedom from persecution” (United Nations, 1948). According to Article 1 of the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees (hereinafter the Refugee Convention), the term refugee will apply to any person who:  …owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. (UNHCR, 1951)  When the Convention was established, criminalization of same-sex sexual relations and transgender expression was common in and promoted by European and settler colony nations, and sexuality was not explicitly stated as one of the criteria for refugee status. Today, 69 states have criminalized sexual activity between males, and 42 have criminal legislation covering consensual sexual activity between females. Consensual same-sex activity is punishable by death in 11 states, while 14 states target transgender people (Human Dignity Trust, 2022), and six UN member states—Nigeria, Mauritania, Yemen, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Brunei—execute members of Lesbian Gay Transgender Bisexual and Queer (LGBTQ) groups (Igual, 2022).  2 While the Refugee Convention permits a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution to seek the protection of another state, queer people have no specific legal protections against persecution under that Convention, even though there is clear evidence of existing discrimination and persecution against them. This Master’s thesis examines how this issue of queer refugees and asylum seekers is treated under Australian law and policy, specifically the treatment and resettlement experiences of queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia.  Since Federation in 1901, Australia has pursued migration and settlement as public policy, specifically as a continuation of colonial agendas to displace First Nations and reshape the population, with the make-up of the migrants sought altering over time. From 1977, Australia has operated a distinct and planned Humanitarian program (Phillips, 2017). As a percentage of Australia’s overall migration intake, humanitarian places fell from over 20% in 1984–85 to a low of under 7% in 2013–14 (Phillips, 2017). The 2022–23 planning levels have Humanitarian places as representing just over 7% of total migration. Australia and other states have refugees referred to them by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) through the international resettlement system, but it also can choose to grant refugee status to those who apply directly. Those seeking protection in Australia outside of the UNHCR system are classified as ‘onshore’ (those already in Australia) or ‘offshore’ (those outside of Australia) (DHA, 2022b). Those who arrive by air can claim asylum in Australia, but those who attempt to arrive by boat (‘maritime arrivals’) are prevented from doing so.   3 The economic cost of policies designed to deter maritime asylum seekers are significant but lie outside the scope of this thesis. The human cost is however directly relevant. The International Detention Coalition finds a significant increased risk to queer people in immigration detention globally (International Detention Coalition, 2016). This is true in Australian detention centers and offshore processing sites. Abuse has been reported against gay and lesbian asylum seekers living on Nauru, and homosexuality is criminalized in Papua New Guinea (Smith, 2017). In one case that was reported on in depth, two men who met and fell in love when in detention on Nauru faced almost constant danger from both homophobic violence and mental illness, exacerbated by being separated from each other because their relationship was not recognized (Hekmat, 2017). It is unknown how many queer people are in Australian offshore and onshore immigration detention centres, but this example highlights the risk faced by those who are. Detention settings are one of many contexts in which queer refugees and asylum seekers face particular risks and challenges. Globally, there is a dearth of literature on the specific experiences of queer refugees and asylum seekers. In Australia, this is also largely true, with some exceptions. Pallas (2016) has looked at the treatment of queer refugees by Australian Appeals Tribunals and found the legal approach defined queerness on whether they were effectively ‘practicing’ homosexuals who went to gay bars, rather than through self-identification as queer.  Australia’s treatment of queer refugees and asylum seekers thus requires examination for two reasons: (1) among those claiming refugee status are queer people who are currently being  4 assessed without reference to the persecution they face as queers in their home states, and (2) even when queer people are resettled as refugees in Australia, settlement services have no specific policies for them. As will be discussed later in the thesis, some people may find themselves becoming asylum seekers not because they do not meet the definition of a refugee, but because the UNHCR determination of refugee status is not available to them when they are fleeing persecution. It is therefore important to consider as a cohort: queer refugees (whether through the UNHCR system or not), queer asylum seekers held in detention, and queer people on (or seeking) any type of protection visa to answer questions about the appropriateness of Australia’s treatment of queer refugees and asylum seekers. It is important because all refugees should be able to live a full life, and this life includes their ‘sexual citizenship’, a term Wilson explains as the bridging of “intimate life and our involvement in the wider society” (Wilson, 2009, p. 75). This connection highlights the importance of cultural context. Writer, Diane Richardson, has been used extensively by scholars who study sexual citizenship, and she critiques the field, urging scholars to focus on the spaces of sexual citizenship and to decenter “western-centric” perspectives (Richardson, 2017, p. 210). In utilizing the concept of sexual citizenship, this thesis explores individual queer experiences of the dominant societal discourses on gender and sexuality that inform Australian refugee and resettlement policy.  Thesis Aims The aims of this thesis are:   5 (i) To understand the current Australian policy context around queer refugees and asylum seekers. (ii) To identify how policy, as a discursive tool, may meet the unique needs of queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia. (iii) To understand the role of service providers in shaping interactions between queer refugees and asylum seekers and the Australian refugee system. Research Questions  The overarching question of this thesis is: “How could Australia’s migration policy better incorporate human experiences and create spaces of peace and dignity for queer refugees?”  There are several sub-questions related to theory, policy, and practice, formulated to address the above question: Theoretical Question: “How does Australian policy on refugee settlement shape notions of sexual citizenship among refugees?”  Question for Policy Review: “What components of Australian national policies on refugee settlement are most and least inclusive of culturally diverse queer people, and what are their underlying characteristics?” Practice-based Question: “What do the professionals who work with queer refugees perceive to be their coping strategies, and how do these professional and queer refugees navigate the restraints of Australian refugee settlement policies?”  Thesis structure  6 To answer these questions, the thesis is arranged into five chapters. The Introduction has presented and positioned the topic of queer refugees and asylum seekers in the Australian policy context. Chapter 2 presents a critical review of the relevant literature where issues of gender, race and power are analysed as they appear in discourse. From here, ideas of queerness and sexual citizenship are explored. Intersections of queerness and displacement are examined from perspectives of both international and local organizations. Other academic literature, primarily from Northern America, focuses on aspects of health, though more recent literature also points to challenges accessing services. Developing a sense of community is a key need identified in literature as queer refugees often have complex relationships with white queer communities and with their own cultural communities. The importance of support groups, the need for service providers to engage in anti-oppressive practice and the need to re-examine the meaning of family in migration systems are all highlighted. Also noted is a lack of literature that connects these everyday issues to policy, a gap this thesis addresses.  Chapter 3 provides a detailed overview of the research approach which utilizes paradigms of queerness, intersectionality and post-colonial theory. In order to answer the research questions, the methods included a policy review and interviews with service providers who work with queer refugees and asylum seekers. A discourse analysis analysed data from policy reviews and interviews.  Chapter 4 examines the main themes that emerged between the policy review and interviews and is broken into four sections. The first section explores the marginalization of gender and sexuality within migration policy. The second looks at how risk is created in the current policy  7 framework and migration system. The third section explores safety creation practices in services as resistance to Cobblers Beach, New South Wales marginalization and violence within the migration system, much of which occurs in interpersonal interactions. Section four details the shifts in the current migration system to better meet the needs of all refugees and asylum seekers, but particularly those who are queer. The final chapter (Chapter 5) provides a summary of the main arguments presented in the thesis, discusses the limitations of the research and outlines recommendations for future research.   8   Chapter 2: Literature Review This chapter explores the gaps in the international architecture of refugee resettlement as it applies to queer people in Australia. It surveys different bodies of literature including post-colonial theory, peace theory and queer theory, in an effort to reach a synthesis that informs improved settlement policy for queer refugees and asylum seekers. The International Refugee Resettlement System Following the Holocaust, the 1951 Refugee Convention established an intergovernmental system of defining and processing displaced migrants. Notably, the definition established at the time was created for this context and has only recently been applied to non-Europeans (Walia, 2021, p. 88). The Refugee Status Determination process is typically carried out by a state, but states may request that the UNHCR complete the process if the state lacks a “fair and efficient asylum national procedure” (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2020).  Although recognition as a refugee is a legal status, it is also a constructed identity as state officials must interpret a “well-founded fear” and the degree to which that fear is connected to the five accepted categories of persecution. Asylum seekers must argue why they fit the legal definition of a refugee. The asylum process guarantees the right of the state to grant asylum and the right of the individual to seek it. However, whether an individual is granted asylum  9 depends on national law, preserving the state’s regulation of who can enter the territory (Boed, 1994). Distinctions between refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants often reflect the “techniques of the state’s power” more than the conditions they face (Murray, 2014, p. 23), and the focusing on refining labels for refugees often have exclusionary effects (Zetter, 2007). These categorisations have vastly different legal rights provided to them, so falling outside the “recognized asylum and refugee apparatus” subjects refugees to increased risks (Zetter, 2015, p. 1).  Asylum cases based on gender or sexual orientation typically fall into “membership within a particular group” (Connely, 2014, p. 5). The basis for refugee status to apply to people who have been persecuted for their gender or sexual orientation was established in international law in the UN Human Rights Committee’s 1994 Toonen v Australia decision. It was the first global body to say gay rights were protected, and laws criminalising homosexuality, like those in Tasmania at the time, were said to breach the right to privacy in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Contributor, 2009; International Detention Coalition, 2016). The UNHCR released the guidelines for cases associated with gender and sexual orientation under the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocols in 2012 (UNHCR, 2012). However, within this system, queer refugees and asylum seekers face dangers from multiple intersecting identities or circumstances (Morales, 2016), such as significant challenges in accessing services and legal protections as national policy rarely accounts for their diversity of circumstances (Giwa & Chaze, 2018; Grungras et al., 2009; Heller, 2009; Lalsinghani, 2018; Lee & Brotman, 2013). According to Volker Türk, former head of Internal Protection at UNHCR, issues  10 of jurisprudence faced by queer refugees include: demanding discretion, criminalization, sexualization, stereotyping, and disbelief (Refugee Studies Center, 2013, pp. 4–7).  Displacement in Australia Although settler colonies, like Australia, the United States and Canada, are sites of third country resettlement and countries of asylum, this is not a binary or one-directional relationship to displacement and refuge. Australia’s relationship with displacement begins a space where people have been displaced from. Due to white colonization, Indigenous peoples throughout what is now called Australia have experienced displacement, genocide, and family separation, carried out militaristically and through services and government sectors, like education, child welfare and the criminal justice system (NSW Public Defenders, 2020). Colonization and resistance to it are ongoing. During the writing of this thesis, multiple protests have been held as Gomeroi people fight efforts by the company, Santos, to overturn their Native Title in order to drill oil seam gas wells on their land (Jakubowski, 2022; jumbunnaresearch, 2022). Other resistance measures include efforts for self-determination, community-based healing programs, and cultural renewal programs (NSW Public Defenders, 2020). Today, displacement remains a colonial problem, both in the displacement of Indigenous peoples and in the enforcement of colonial borders, which disregard Indigenous sovereignty (Walia, 2021, p. 26). Representation of queer refugees and asylum seekers Networks of queer refugees, asylum seekers and their allies in Australia have done significant work identifying gaps and making recommendations to policymakers and service providers. Notably, the Forcibly Displaced Person's Network (FDPN) released the Canberra  11 Statement following the first Queer Displacements Conference in 2019. The statement made several demands, including: the need for interpreting and translation services to be LGBTIQ+ sensitive, inclusive health services, timely provision of identity documents, recognition of prior education, holistic consideration of identity in policy, and support for LGBTIQ+ refugee led organizations. The statement has over 350 signatories (Dixon, 2019). A few other organizations exist in Australia in which LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers have a strong voice of advocacy, some of which provide trainings. The New South Wales Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors (STARRTS) runs live trainings for inclusive practice working with LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers (STARTTS, 2021), and Many Colored Sky also provides training to service providers through the Queer Refugee and Asylum Seeker Services Network (QRASSN) (Many Coloured Sky, 2022). FDPN also offers online training (FDPN, 2021). Service organizations have produced several reports, including the 2022 Guidelines for Social Workers Working with People from Refugee Backgrounds, created in partnership by STARRTS, the Australian Association of Social Workers and the New South Wales Refugee Health Service, which includes a section on working with people of diverse genders, sexualities and bodies (STARTTS et al., 2022). Refugee Advice and Casework Services (RACS) has also released a toolkit for legal representatives and community workers engaging with people whose asylum claims are based on sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and/or sex characteristics (RACS, 2022). These organizations have drastically expanded the opportunities for service provision to be more accountable to queer refugee and asylum seeker clients and have created spaces for grassroots mobilization for policy  12 change. However, the use of such resources remains dependent on individual service providers and organizations. Discourses of power and gender Several scholars address conditions of queer refugees, many of which relate to structures of power and violence. Queer feminist theorists, particularly Butler, have built on Foucault’s scholarship to describe the construction of institutions and hierarchies that shape everyday relationships, including gender and family. Foucault’s approach to discourse involves the use of language, symbols, and actions to produce meaning and knowledge and to form institutions, which embed power (Foucault & Ewald, 2003).  Foucault and Butler extend their critiques of power relations beyond individuals to states, which participate in discourse to regulate the behavior of both individuals and entire populations. In Precarious Life, Butler writes about the devaluation of lives that fall outside the state’s discursive “human”, arguing:  Some lives are grievable and others are not; it is the differential grievability that decides what kind of subject is and must be grieved, and which kind of subject must not, operates to produce and maintain exclusionary conceptions of who is normatively human: what counts as a livable life and a grievable death? (Butler, 2006a)  Butler ties the violence of death, and death which is ungrievable, to the structures of the state, even when these structures may be less visible than the violence they produce. Similarly, Natalie Cisneros summarizes Foucault’s writing stating: “discourses and practices surrounding abnormality and deviance have enacted and justified the marginalization” of individuals, including their removal by the state (Cisneros, 2016, pp. 84–89; Foucault, 2018).   13 Feminist and abolitionist scholar, Angela Davis, critiques and expands upon Foucault’s analysis by expanding on the complexities of racism and gender oppression (Cisneros, 2016, p. 87). Davis writes the necessity of antiracism to be engrained in abolitionist work to counter existing racist discourse (Davis, 2003b, p. 366). Davis includes the dismantling of migrant detention in abolition work, noting the common threat of incarceration to migrants of colour in states with a normative white citizen and citizens of colour who are over-represented in prisons (Davis, 2012, p. 26), both observed in Australia. Colonial discourses  Scholars who take an historical view of migration and borders note a shift towards rigid borders aligned with political control stemming from European colonialism. O’Dowd writes about the transition from imperialist powers, which sought to expand and control their territory by force, to modern nation states, which retain political and economic control over their territory through bureaucracy (O’Dowd, 2010, pp. 1035–1045). In this process, O’Dowd notes the discursive nature of borders, which are enforced based on a state’s relative power (O’Dowd, 2010, p. 1,035). Notions of ethnic hierarchies have been preserved in the transition from empires to national states with strict borders. Human rights lawyer and scholar E. Tendayi Achiume points out that today’s migration systems continue to uphold divisions between formerly colonized peoples and former colonizers, where the movements of the former are restricted so they may not access the wealth that the latter gained at the former population’s expense, even as the latter benefit from the unequal conditions between them (Achiume, 2019).   14 Davis notes the “disappearance” of race from policy’s explicit language even as policies are deeply racialized in practice (Davis, 2012). In migration policy, legal scholar Kevin Johnson, identified that anti-immigration sentiments enforce ethno-states because discrimination based on immigration status is more acceptable than race (Johnson, 1998, p. 1,116). Despite the overturning of the White Australia Policy, also called the Immigration Restriction Act, which restricted immigration of non-European peoples and particularly targeted Asian peoples between 1901 and 1973 (York, 2016), migration experts suggest that Australian migration policy still selected a primarily white incoming population through requirements that tended to correlate with race (Morgan, 2020). According to James Jupp: “the social and economic situation in many countries outside Europe or North America makes more probable some form of discrimination against immigrants from them\" (Jupp, 2007, p. 63).  Migration policy must be seen in the context of discursive population shaping. Indeed, the role of migration policy in shaping the population is so strong that the Productivity Commission is quoted saying: “Australia’s immigration policy is its de facto population policy” (Doherty & Evershed, 2018).  Social discourse and policy are inherently connected, with literature from psychology finding that increasingly regulated borders correlate with \"widespread antipathy and resentment\" towards outsiders (Adler & Gielen, 2003, p. 8). Australian migration increasingly implements temporary migration policies (Boucher & Davidson, 2019, pp. 15–17) and has developed some of the harshest policies for asylum seekers who arrive without documentation. The restrictive nature of these policies is a “culture of control” (Jupp, 2007, p. 59) and \"a culture of control also  15 implies a culture of suspicion\" (Jupp, 2007, p. 63). In 2015, psychology and human rights scholars found that “Asylum seekers and refugees are often seen as a threat to national sovereignty, the economy and social cohesion” a narrative that questions what rights a host country ought to grant them, with particular prejudice and suspicion towards asylum seekers (Hartley & Pedersen, 2015). Indeed, the issue of maritime asylum seeker arrivals in Australia has been heavily politicised for over two decades, with narratives of ‘good’ orderly refugees waiting in UNHCR camps and ‘queue-jumpers’ allegedly doing something illegal by claiming asylum (Hawksley & Georgeou, 2013, p. 263).  Sexual citizenship In addition to shaping the notion of a foreign outsider through racialized discourse, colonization heavily shaped notions of sexual citizenship and family. Beyond simply being overlapping identities, race and gender are deeply intertwined. Qwo-Li Driskill writes about how gender is used as “a tool to gain power over others” in the colonial process and describes how white masculinity has been constructed to perpetuate racial and gendered violence: “It is a masculinity that requires men to be soldiers and conquerors in every aspect of their lives. A masculinity rooted in genocide breeds a culture of sexual abuse” (Driskill, 2004, p. 54). Likewise, Clark writes that this relationship between race, gender, and sexuality must be considered in understanding queerness in an Australian context:  Queer Australia must begin to understand not only racism and homonormativity within the LGBTIQ community, but also the underlying relationship between sexuality and the racialised white nation, and how that relationship has travelled through all of frontier and post-federation history and into the present. (Clark, 2015, p. 3)  16 Significantly, as violence becomes structural rather than direct, the same pattern appears. Aren Aizura, a gender, women and sexuality scholar, argues that exclusion based on race and national origin is constructed in gendered terms, just as exclusion based on gender or relationship is constructed with ‘foreignness’ (Aizura, 2006, p. 289). A gendered hierarchy is therefore as much part of the Western colonial project as racial constructions. Both Foucault’s and Butler’s writing on gender challenge an “essential” or “natural” gender identity. Butler in particular, relates the active construction of gender as the embedding of power, particularly by the state. Butler writes: “there is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that identity is performativity constituted by the very “expressions” that are said to be its results” (Butler, 2004, p. 33). Numerous scholars have built on this understanding of gender to explain the state’s role of shaping gender and sexual behavior through sexual citizenship. Gender Studies scholar Katja Kahlina, notes how participation in society, including going through migration systems, accessing healthcare, and participating in the labour market, is facilitated by adherence to familial and gender norms. Those who do not adhere to the norms are punished with barriers to participation (Kahlina, 2015, p. 1).  Various feminist and gender studies scholars identify characteristics of “good” Western sexual citizens and reflect Western values (Richardson, 2017, p. 216). Among the defining notions are binary gender, heteronormativity, and patriarchal relations (Rich, 1980). Examples in literature show a shift in some Western countries towards institutionalizing queer identities by integrating them into nationalistic discourse. Kahlina writes about homonationalism, in which Western countries use the appearance of acceptance of LGBTQ people to portray themselves as  17 more moral than states that do not, thereby justifying policy initiatives that advance their own interests (Kahlina, 2015, p. 2). In other cases, queer people are identified with state narratives like family and reproduction, aligning queerness with normalized sexual relationships to assert their lives as valuable, rather than challenge the structures that decide that some people’s lives are valuable and those of others are not. Struggles for queer people to be accepted in the military or to have traditional marriages are examples of such assimilation identified by Critical Race Theorist and legal scholar, Oscar Monaghan, who points to them as a strengthening of the colonial state rather than advancing acceptance (Monaghan, 2015, p. 202). Literature on homonationalism likewise warns that it does not indicate acceptance of gender and sexual diversity (Murray, 2015) Australia’s history sets up its particular form of sexual citizenship within the Western context that is defined through co-existing discourses of “liberal multiculturalism and explicit white colonialism” (Aizura, 2006, p. 291). Monaghan quotes Schneider’s description of the early period of global expansion of colonial rule to describe how settler homonationalism has been formed in Australia:  colonialists viewed the diverse gendered and sexual practices of the Indigenous peoples they encountered as proof of a deviance and depravity that justified colonial intervention, and ‘the tendency or tactic of Europeans to see sodomy everywhere enabled a devastating two-fisted excuse for murderous violence and a complicated homoerotics of genocide’. (Monaghan, 2015, p. 199)  As the Australian state expanded, numerous policies were put in place to increase the population, especially with white and European decedents. The value of reproduction and nuclear families can still be observed in policy initiatives from recent decades. Aizura gives the example of the Marriage Amendment Act of 2004, which excluded same-sex couples and gave  18 $3,000 to each family following the birth of a child, with nationalistic messaging, including the then Treasurer Peter Costello joking “that couples should have ‘one [child] for Mum, one for Dad and one for the country” (Aizura, 2006, p. 291). Grey literature on queerness and displacement Queer refugees must navigate all aspects of Australia’s colonial context and occupy a unique space in which social and political discourse frame them as deviant or outsiders in multiple ways. These unique experiences are recognized in limited ways by humanitarian and intergovernmental organizations, which in the past couple of decades, contributed grey literature pertaining to issues affecting queer refugees. Most of this literature is directed towards the work of individuals and offices in organizations to increase their competency and change organizational culture. Such programming is important, but it does not necessarily reflect change on a structural level or advocate policy changes. In 2011, the UNHCR released the guide Working with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Persons in Forced Displacement, which provides assertions of the rights to equal treatment for LGBT persons and calls for a rights-based protection approach to working with them. The guide prioritizes creating safe ways for identification, acknowledging difficulties experienced by LGBT refugees in establishing trust and disclosing details of their circumstances. It also advocates for ensuring physical safety, acknowledging increased risk of HIV and housing instability in queer populations. Finally, the guide encourages building partnerships with civil society actors and heightening risk assessment in resettlement options (Division of International Protection, 2011). In addition, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) provides a  19 training package for working with LGBTI persons, which is also designed to be used by UNHCR. The package covers guidelines for practitioners on topics such as terminology, situational awareness and risk assessment (IOM, 2019). In 2018 in Australia, the government of New South Wales and the NSW Refugee Health Service released a fact sheet that focuses on individuals whose asylum claims are based on gender or sexual orientation and notes some of the unique challenges they face concerning interpreting and health (LGBTI Refugees, 2018). Resources, such as those above, tend to cover challenges more generally and provide information for handling only a few manifestations of vulnerabilities. Two of the more detailed pieces of grey literature include a report from UNHCR, which provides information on initiatives by individual UNHCR offices that have addressed challenges faced by LGBTI asylum seekers and refugees. It does not however, specifically address interactions with policy in contexts like Australia (UNHCR, 2015). A section of a report released by the Women’s Refugee Commission on identifying and responding to urban refugees’ risks of gender-based violence provides one of the most detailed pieces of organizational literature to date. The report is based on field assessments with input from 74 LGBTI refugees. It includes details about many of the vulnerabilities LGBTI refugees face in urban settings, such as being outed, a lack of social support, difficulty finding employment, exploitation in sex work, and so on. The report also notes the risks of violence in host countries due to legal persecution of LGBTI people, a general lack of structure to support and protect LGBTI persons, particularly a lack of emergency protocols and emergency funds and numerous cases of negative interactions with police (Rosenberg, 2016). The report presents an extensive  20 list of policy and programming recommendations, mostly directed towards humanitarian and intergovernmental organizations. Some of their recommendations can be implemented by state organizations, such as “Develop qualifications and criteria for hiring service providers, including [gender based violence] case managers, and ensure they receive proper operational training around engaging LGBTI refugees before engaging any refugees,” and include “mainstream LGBTI protection issues into all urban response programming and discourse” (Rosenberg, 2016, p. 26). Notably, the report focuses on interactions with policy and reflect the conditions of refugees who live in cities over camps and less on refugees who have been resettled in a third country. Academic literature on queerness and displacement The majority of academic literature relating to queer refugees and asylum seekers concerns the determination process for those whose asylum claim is based on their sexual orientation or gender. Queer people seeking asylum face numerous challenges to their legitimacy or credibility as applicants (Millbank, 2009), and “must develop narratives that prove their queerness, while also including the forms of violence expected by a Western audience” (Ritholtz & Buxton, 2021, p. 1077; Pallas 2016).  Refugees are gendered as a group and tend to be discussed with binary language. When the UNHCR was created in the 1950s, discourses on refugees tended to reflect Western masculine stereotypes, such as heroism, whereas more recent discourse portrays refugees with Western feminine stereotypes, such as vulnerability. Other discourse analysis, particularly that undertaken in Northwestern Europe, shows a tendency to dichotomize refugees as being worthy or unworthy, voluntary or involuntary. However, the diversity and complexity of  21 people’s experiences is often overlooked (Akin, 2019, p. 22). Intersectionality and the impacts of multiple layers of marginalization are often unrecognized. When multiple identities are recognized, it is often to invalidate the danger resulting from one identity with the privilege gained from another (McDonald-Norman, 2017, pp. 92–93). One of the most significant challenges for all refugees, but particularly queer refugees, are limitations on country information made available to officials who decide the cases that make it difficult for such asylum seekers to prove their cases because the complexity of their experiences are removed from the historical record and privileges and hierarchies that create a context of persecution (McDonald-Norman, 2017, p. 87). Even when available, country information is inherently tied to the social and political context in which it is being used. Country information may be viewed through a colonial lens, lack of recognition of intersectionality, or may simply not portray a country’s situation in ways that match the circumstances of an individual who has experienced persecution. Many applicants must justify their fear based on incidents that happen to people in similar situations, but media coverage and large-scale recognition of people in their situation may not be present or may be distorted (McDonald-Norman, 2017, pp. 89–91). Other challenges identified pertain to the legitimacy of queerness. In cases where a person’s gender or sexual orientation is the basis for their asylum claim, they may be put in the position of trying to prove that they are queer (Pallas 2016). This can be difficult both technically and emotionally. As Lalsinghani points out, “Pressed to disclose and prove their closeted identities and recount experiences of violence or trauma, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer  22 (LGBTQ)-identifying individuals are often pigeonholed within the broader bureaucracy of the asylum application” (Lalsinghani, 2018, p. 1). Indeed, a number of studies have identified disturbing examples of asylum cases being decided based on stereotypes of sexual and gender minorities and invasive medical examinations (LaViolette, 2013).  Until they prove that they are genuinely queer, refugees can be perceived as misusing the immigration process and the claim to being queer (Akin, 2019, p. 26). However, what constitutes a “genuine” queer refugee, those who are both truly queer and have a legitimate fear, is continually constructed (Akin, 2019, pp. 23–24). These “genuine” refugees are interpreted through the host country’s paradigms of gender, sexuality, and patriarchy. The violence they have endured relating to their queerness must also meet the assessors’ expectations, which are often deeply Westernized (Millbank, 2009). For example, in Norway, the normative image of a queer refugee is “willing to be publicly visible, vulnerable by default and possesses no agency that would come off as a threat to the host society” (Akin, 2019, p. 40).  Even those who seek to help queer refugees can reinforce neoliberal relations by failing to include histories of colonialism, imperialism, and racism in “authentic” refugee narratives, which consequently fail to capture the systems of injustice that queer asylum seekers face in their country of origin, as well as in their host country. In many cases, homonationalism is found in self-proclaimed ally spaces that promote asylum based on queerness (Murray, 2014, p. 29). For refugees of specific, poorly understood gender and sexual identities, these challenges are exacerbated. Asylum seekers in Canada, the U.S. and Australia are far less likely to have  23 successful asylum claims based on bisexuality compared to other sexual minorities (Rehaag, 2009, p. 426). Prior research points to erasure of bisexuality to account for the lack of attention given to bisexual asylum seekers as well as disparaging views of bisexuals (Rehaag, 2009, p. 429). Transgender asylum seekers also face challenges when measured against Western, binary genders, which leave little room for androgynous identities, fluidity, or culturally diverse notions of gender. The word ‘transgender’ itself, reflects “conceptual underpinnings that assume a sex/gender distinction as well as an analytic segregation of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression” (Clark, 2015, p. 2) and is always able to capture the reality of an asylum seeker’s identity or the context of persecution that they are fleeing. Lack of access to name changes and government officials’ reactions to names changes are identified as posing particular difficulty for transgender refugees (Lee & Brotman, 2011, p. 259).  Other relevant academic literature is scarce but growing. A systematic review of literature on policy pertaining to queer refugees notes that since 2011, the literature has expanded beyond domination by legal perspectives and now includes work relating to services (Lee et al., 2021, pp. 835–836). However, this review focuses primarily on Canadian literature, and there remains a significant imbalance between scholarship on North American contexts and the rest of the world. In most cases, scholarship outside legal perspectives focuses on psychology and identity or specific services, particularly health. Examples of literature that focus on psychology, but touch on policy issues, include analyses of identity construction as queer people go through the asylum process in Sweden (Korten, 2019); research on religion and identity (Alessi et al., 2019);  24 and trauma and resilience (Alessi, 2016; Alessi et al., 2018). Physical and mental health challenges and obtaining health services are the most prolific areas of work concerning queer refugees and asylum seekers in services (Burgess, 2021; Castro et al., 2021; Deem, n.d.; D’souza et al., 2022; Fox et al., 2020; Gahagan & Colpitts, 2017; Gerena, 2022; Kahn et al., 2017; Kostenius et al., 2021; Logie, Lacombe-Duncan, Lee-Foon, et al., 2016; F. R. Morales et al., 2022; Mulé, 2021; Namer & Razum, 2018).  A 2022 systematic review of literature on the health of sexuality and gender diverse migrants during migration notes a lack of literature, but does offer some important findings. Multiple studies have shown that mental illness may be more prevalent among queer forcibly-displaced persons than their non-queer counterparts (Shidlo & Ahola, 2013; White et al., 2019; Yarwood et al., 2022, p. 2). Additionally, services are particularly inaccessible for transgender refugees and asylum seekers. The review also identifies literature on performing sex work due to financial insecurity, often in risky circumstances that increase the likelihood of contracting HIV and STIs (Broqua et al., 2021; Gottlieb et al., 2020; Tohme et al., 2016; Yarwood et al., 2022). Similarly, literature has identified how restrictions to services and rights create precariousness in the migration process, particularly for undocumented people, those who are at risk of detention, and for trans sex workers (Lee et al., 2021, p. 838). Research on coping mechanisms for queer refugees and asylum seekers has identified the importance of community, support groups, and access to healthcare, housing and employment (Logie, Lacombe-Duncan, Lee-Foon, et al., 2016; Yarwood et al., 2022, p. 15). Other academic  25 work exploring social connections and belonging also highlights the importance of community, which is both crucial for wellbeing but often complicated for queer refugees and asylum seekers due to challenges from racism and homophobia (Lee & Brotman, 2011, p. 259). Held writes that LGBTQ spaces are often “ambivalent,” for queer refugees, whose experiences are deeply shaped by intersecting identities (Held, 2022). Some attention has been paid to the role of less traditional forms of social support. A study by Kahn, which focused on gender-nonconforming asylum seekers, argues for a more nuanced view of the social support available than is found in the traditional family-oriented lens used by most resettlement programs. Kahan found that many face alienation from their families, co-ethnic communities, and broad community members. She also found that while many gender non-conforming asylum seekers have had negative experiences with services providers, in some cases, welcoming and receptive service providers served as “kinship proxies.” Although she notes important support from these service providers, she also highlights that these relationship are often temporary (Kahn, 2015, pp. 73–77). Support groups are one coping mechanism identified for providing social benefits for queer refugees. Scholars have found that they are able to facilitate self-acceptance, improve mental health, reduce isolation, help develop friendships, and reduce stigma, as well as mitigate structural challenges in immigration, health, housing, and employment through emotional support and resources and knowledge sharing; they also can provide opportunities for reciprocity and the ability for participants to support their community (Lee et al., 2021, p. 837; Logie, Lacombe-Duncan, Nakia Lee-Foon, et al., 2016). However, several questions about the  26 function of support groups remain, as well as some challenges. Even when refugee led, queer refugees are not homogeneous, and some groups may not be equally inclusive of all identities (Held, 2022, p. 11). Additionally, other research calls into question whether civil society groups, including support groups, contribute to structural change. Ambrosini & Van der Leun write that NGOs and social movements involved in immigration advocacy rarely attack the policies or institutional structures that they work within, even while providing important resources or rhetorically opposing anti-immigration policies (Ambrosini & Van der Leun, 2015, p. 111–112).  Literature on the social networks of queer refugees also calls for a rethinking of “family” in immigration policy. Ritholtz and Buxton (2021) write that family is prioritized within human rights frameworks as the basic unit of society, and family unification is emphasized within international refugee policy. However, the understanding of family is often applied restrictively and relies on proving formal recognitions of partner relationship, which is often queer exclusionary. For example, by requiring partners to show that they live together to prove their partnership does not consider that living together may have put them in danger in their country of origin (Ritholtz & Buxton, 2021, p. 1,081). Ritholtz and Buxton argue for the inclusion of chosen family in refugee and asylum seeker regimes: … the broader protection system is not fit in its current form to accept them as people—people whose success depends on their abilities to form relationships and rely on community” and may endanger them by basing their support on family units that may contribute to violence. (Ritholtz & Buxton, 2021, p. 1087)  They advocate that refugee systems must address structural cis-heteronormative bias and re-evaluate how family is defined in the current framework (Ritholtz & Buxton, 2021, p. 1,078).  27 Within the literature on services for queer refugees and asylum seekers, housing has been identified as particularly challenging due to societal discrimination, with many describing “experiences of systemic racism, language barriers and intersectional marginalizing experiences (due to racism, sexism, and heterosexism) especially during their time in refugee/youth shelters and searching for stable housing” (Lee & Brotman, 2011, p. 257). Other literature from scholars in social work focus on the role of service providers, including a piece on strategies to improve culturally appropriate interpreting for queer refugees (Hemesi, 2020). Another piece on social work in Canada advocates that social workers develop “an understanding of the historical, social, political, and structural dimensions that shape the complex ways in which multiple oppressions operate and encourage reflexivity for social workers” (Lee & Brotman, 2013, p. 171) and encourages policy advocacy (Lee & Brotman, 2013, p. 174). Another article that focuses on service provision for LGBTQ migrants in general finds an overwhelming lack of policy addressing vulnerabilities. As Chávez comments: The assessment shows that no services are provided specifically for LGBTQ migrants, and most LGBTQ migrants turn to family and friends when they have needs. The most significant result of this study pertains to the lack of cultural competence and an overall deficiency in terms of cultural awareness when it comes to the specific needs of LGBTQ migrants. (Chávez, 2011)  Other studies touch on issues connected to policy: Giwa and Chaze write about settlement of LGBTQ immigrants, highlighting the importance of inclusive content on websites and methods of signaling inclusivity throughout the organization’s marketing (Giwa & Chaze, 2018, p. 20). Legal scholar, Katelin Morales, discusses the violence faced by queer asylum seekers by Australia’s detention policies, specifically in Papua New Guinea, which has strict laws against homosexuality (Morales, 2016).   28 However, the settlement needs of queer refugees and asylum seekers remain “underrepresented in the literature\" (Giwa & Chaze, 2018, p. 4). Lee and Brotman, likewise, note a lack of literature regarding queer refugee and asylum seekers’ interactions with policy outside specific legal procedures, which typically do not include detention centers or settlement services (Lee & Brotman, 2011, p. 262).   Although the above research is valuable for regarding the conditions that queer refugees’ experience, more academic literature on the interactions between policy and service provision for queer refugees is needed. The research in this thesis seeks to fill that gap, ultimately identifying how policy may depart from structures of colonial violence to facilitate a more peaceful migration process for queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia.   29   Chapter 3: Methodology and methods Methodological approach—Queer Theory The term “queer” is used in this thesis to describe people who are positioned outside cisgender, binary and heterosexual norms. Although often used interchangeably with LGBTQ identities, the term queer is not simply an evolution of describing same-sex attraction (Jagose, 2009, p. 74), but a relational term rather than a description of an identity. Annamarie Jagose writes, “queer may be used to describe an open-ended constituency, whose shared characteristic is not identity itself but an antinormative positioning with regard to sexuality” (Jagose, 1996, p. 98). Queer, as a post-structuralist concept, is often used over exclusionary categories such as lesbian and gay as part of a tradition of destabilizing ideas of “naturalized” identity categories, including gender and race. Its use recognizes identity as mediated rather than fixed and is often used to move away from identity politics (Jagose, 2009, pp. 76–77). Butler describes the constructed nature of gender that underpins queer, arguing “as a shifting and contextual phenomenon, gender does not denote a substantive being, but a relative point of convergence among culturally and historically specific sets of relations” (Butler, 1999, p. 16). Likewise, Butler destabilizes the notion of sex and sexuality (Butler, 1999, p. 13). Gender is not just an interpretation of a fixed, biological sex, rather sex is understood through regulatory practices of gender norms and the “heterosexualization of desire”(Butler, 1999, p.  30 23). To describe the interplay of gender, sex, and sexuality, Butler describes the heterosexual matrix as a “grid of cultural intelligibility through which bodies, genders, and desires are naturalized” (Butler, 1999, p. 194). The matrix positions male and female gender categories as oppositional, hierarchal, and binary, and creates categories of “homosexual” and “heterosexual” based on where a person falls in the overlay of their gender and the object of their sexual attraction. In this grid, heterosexuality and masculine sexual agency are naturalized and assumed (Butler, 2006b) and based upon “a stable sex expressed through stable gender” (Butler, 2006b, p. 151). In this understanding, gender, sex, and sexuality cannot be separated from each other.  Many of the people who were interviewed or who were discussed in interviews for this thesis identify with some element of the LGBT acronym (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender). However, due to connections between gender, sex and sexuality and as a resistance to the segmentation of binary gender and oppositions positionings of sexuality, queer is used in this thesis to encompass these identities without limiting other ways of being at odds with conventional notions of gender and sexuality. This is not to say that all queer people have the same experiences; in fact, it problematizes the idea that people who identify with the same gender or sexual orientation have heterogeneous experiences. Butler writes, “because gender intersects with racial, class, ethnic, sexual, and regional modalities of discursively constituted identities…it becomes impossible to separate out “gender” from the political and cultural intersections in which it is invariably produced and maintained” (Butler, 1999, p. 6). The term queer is used to understand the discourse and regulatory mechanisms that define who is positioned outside the notions of a “correct” sexual citizen.   31 Methodological approach—Peace Theory The central question of this thesis addresses the possibilities for Australian migration policy to create more peace-oriented outcomes for queer refugees and asylum seekers. Thus it is important to understand both the functioning of the Australian state and the policy used to shape it, as well as the meaning of peace in this context. In doing so, it is possible to understand how policy can be used for either peace or violence.  Johan Galtung is typically credited with detailing the ways that violence can be direct, structural, or cultural, addressing both antagonizing attitudes and structural inequalities, rather than violence that presents itself only in physical altercations. Galtung goes on to define “positive peace,” as being devoid of all three types of violence, rather than simply being the absence of direct violence (Galtung, 1990). Consequently, “positive peace moves beyond attempts to end violent conflicts to also focus on critical rights such as social and political equity, access to quality health care, access to economic opportunities, freedom to express one’s self without fear, and to develop one’s abilities without obstruction” and sets a stage for conflict transformation (Dutta et al., 2016, p. 3). Other peacebuilding scholars have extended the idea of positive peace to an “everyday peace,” one in which peace “is context specific and involves the observations and decisions made by individuals and communities as they navigate their way through life” (Mac Ginty & Firchow, 2016, p. 309). This framework lends itself to recognizing intersectionality through its responsiveness to the nuances of many aspects of identity as pointed out by Mac Ginty: “The everyday peace notion shows that a complex array of intergroup interactions can occur in many  32 contexts and are sensitive to calibration according to gender, class, locality, and interpretations of decency and civility” (Mac Ginty, 2014). The idea of everyday peace connects the experiences of individuals and local communities with macro conflicts and systematic oppression, entwining peace on personal, communal, and societal levels. Furthermore, everyday peace “recognizes marginalized people as competent commentators and observers of their world, and capable of engaging with the practices, routines and radical events that shape their everyday resistances and peacebuilding” (Berents, 2015, p. 1). Using everyday peace as a framework, power is repositioned as existing on grassroots levels rather than concentrated in hierarchical institutions.  33 Methodological approach—Intersectionality A second body of theory that informs the thesis is Intersectionality, a term first coined by Kimberly Crenshaw in a critique of second wave feminist theories to describe the unique ways that oppression impacts black women. Crenshaw describes the way black women are erased in the conceptualization of race and sex-based workplace discrimination in legal contexts, which focus on discrimination towards white women and black men. She describes the ways that unique experiences come from the overlaying of both race and gender rather than black women simply facing the types of oppression white women and black men face simultaneously. Crenshaw argues for the need to acknowledge how race and gender simultaneously impact inequalities (Crenshaw, 1989). Crenshaw’s analysis has influenced scholars who engage with many forms of marginalization to take into account the different aspects of one’s identity and how they influence each other rather than trying to examine each aspect separately. Intersectionality has been applied to numerous queer and feminist movements and has been cited in countless pieces of academic literature (Adames et al., 2018; Addison & Coolhart, 2015; Duran et al., 2020; Evans & Lépinard, 2019; Fotopoulou, 2012; Lee & Brotman, 2013; Maturi & Munro, 2022; Rahman, 2010; Rice et al., 2020). An intersectional lens is used in this research to understand the unique circumstances impacting people who live as both queer and displaced. It is used particularly in the research question regarding characteristics of inclusive and exclusive policies when determining how inequality and discrimination are compounded by issues such as intersectional experiences of racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism, misogyny, and citizenship status.  Researcher Positionality  34 My writing about queerness, migration, colonialism, and white supremacy starts with my relationship with the land on which I grew up. I am grateful to have had my hands in the soil and to have been raised by the land my family lives on, as well as by them; my place on the land and in relationship to it has always been secure. However, we were not the first caretakers of that land. Although the Indigenous residents of our land were likely displaced long before my father's family came to the United States, we often find reminders that generations of people loved, cared for, and depended on the land; they almost certainly did not leave by choice. My family was able to buy land amidst a legal and capitalist system that sought to prevent non-white families from doing the same.  My place in the conversation about issues affecting queer refugees in Australia comes in part from having space carved out for me as a white person, an American Citizen, a native-English speaker, and someone who could prioritize my education. It also comes from my socialization as a feminine presenting person, a queer person, and a relatively low-income member of my community, which is rapidly being developed by wealthy suburbanites. However, in this work I am tied to people with very different experiences. My career has been mostly spent working on migration issues in various geographical spaces, and this research is heavily influenced by the guidance of colleagues from multiple organizations and cultural contexts, and now by Australian communities. Additionally, being part of communities and families around the world and having people come into my life with very different circumstances makes my research personal. I arrived at this research out of anger, fear, and love tied to the struggles of my family of choice. The more I am involved in this work, the more strongly I feel that our stories cannot be separated from one another; I am both dependent on others holding space for  35 me and responsible for holding space for them. This research is about more than policy, it is about family, a relationship to home, and community. It is about exploring what respecting and loving each other will mean in practice. Research Methods (i) Policy Review  This project utilizes multiple qualitative research methods. The first is a policy review, which is used to analyse both Australian Commonwealth migration policies and the policies of two states regarding service provision to answer the research questions dealing with notions of sexual citizenship and inclusive vs exclusive policies. A policy analysis was chosen for this project to facilitate studying the migration system, rather than constructing interview participants or refugees and asylum seekers as “subjects” that the research creates knowledge about. In discussing research approaches, Kim Tallbear, a Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate at the University of Alberta, reflects on Laura Nader’s article: “Up the Anthropologist”(Nader, 1972). Tallbear notes the importance of studying those in power rather than only researching exploited and marginalized populations, particularly as a process of decolonizing research (Matika Wilbur & Adrienne Keene, 2019, pt. 52:20). In line with Tallbear’s assertions, this project focuses on studying refugee systems, including policy and the roles of people working within it.  The Commonwealth policies examined include the Migration Act, The Migration Regulations, PAM3 Guidelines, the Acts Interpretation Act of 1901, the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment Act 2014, and the Work and Safety Act (Operation Sovereign Borders) Declaration of 2013. Data from the interviews and analysis of Commonwealth policies  36 was so rich that, given the limitations of the thesis’s length, the decision was made to focus only on the national policy review and interviews, and not to include state-level policy analysis.  (ii) Individual Interviews  Semi-structured interviews were completed with seven service providers who actively work in refugee spaces and queer organizations to answer the research question about coping mechanisms. Interviews, as a conversation, “focus on language and its social organization” (Esterberg, 2002, p. 84). In semi-structured interviews, basic ideas are planned, but the conversation ultimately unfolds during the interview and allows for a freer exchange than in structured interviews. Esterberg writes that semi-structured interviews allow for observations to emerge that could not be predicted before the conversation. She notes that this approach has been used frequently in feminist literature and is thought to create space for traditionally marginalized peoples to tell their own story. (Esterberg, 2002, p. 87)  The seven service providers interviewed came from the following fields of work: health, translation and interpreting, legal services, casework, social support, and advocacy. Among these providers, one was an Australian-born citizen, two were former refugees or asylum seekers, and four were non-refugee immigrants. Three interviewees are from Australasia, one is from South Asia, one is from the Middle East, and two are from Europe. Two interviewees identified as both cisgender and heterosexual, and five identified as being LGBTQ, namely queer, pansexual, and transgender. Six out of the seven identified as a woman, and one identified as a man. All providers are based in the states that were originally set to be included in the policy review, but two of them have clients from across Australia, including in offshore  37 detention centers. One also serves clients internationally. Demographics for individual interviewees are not listed together and more specific demographics are not given because the community of people who work with queer refugees and asylum seekers is relatively small and there is a significant possibility of the anonymity of these interviewees not being preserved if the demographics were paired together.  Recruitment of Participants  Interview recruitment was initially attempted by emailing individual organizations serving refugees and asylum seekers or queer communities, who work or used to work directly with these groups based on their job’s thematic focus. In some cases, organizations’ general email was used to ask for the most appropriate person to direct the informational email to. The email provided project information and an invitation to participate in the research. However, most interviews were secured through snowball sampling from personal connections. In some cases, these contacts came through a recommendation and introduction from interviewees' colleagues. In other cases, the researcher met interviewees outside the formal recruitment process by attending public events about refugee issues in Sydney.  Interview Process The following questions were used to guide the semi-structured interviews:  1. How do you approach differences in gender and sexual orientation in your work? 2. What are the main communication challenges your LGBTQ clients face accessing your services, and how do they typically access the services?   38 3. What are the main structural challenges your LGBTQ clients face accessing your services, and how do they typically navigate them?  4. Where do LGBTQ refugees fit into Australian society? 5. Where is there the most potential for change in the migration system? Interviews were conducted throughout July and August 2022 via Zoom in English and were audio recorded. All interviews were between an hour and an hour and a half in length. They were transcribed using Otter, an AI program, and checked for accuracy. All identifying details, including names and workplaces, were removed from the transcripts.  Data Analysis  NVivo software was used to code the project data and to compare trends in coding. Open coding in grounded theory was used to analyze the data. Grbich writes that grounded theory is an inductive approach that identifies how meaning is constructed and is particularly useful for small-scale projects on topics without significant prior research (Grbich, 2007, pp. 70–71). Open coding is one approach to grounded theory that uses “word by word, line by line analysis questioning the data in order to identify concepts and categories which can then be dimensionalised” (Grbich, 2007, p. 74). After coding, data from the policy review and interviews was then triangulated to broaden understanding of the interaction between policy and lived experience. Specific attention was paid to areas in which the policy review overlapped with testaments from interviewees.  Discourse Analysis  39 This thesis applies discourse analysis to policy and data from practitioners working with queer refugees and asylum seekers. Discourse analysis involves the examination of language and symbols in the construction of relationships and society, essentially understanding the construction of “reality through language” (Grbich, 2007, p. 146). Butler asserts that social structures, particularly gender and sexuality, are acted out through symbols, norms, and adherence to social positions (Butler, 2004). With this understanding, discourse analysis facilitates critical examination of the positioning of gender and sexual diversity within Australia’s refugee policies.  Although critical discourse analysis is often used to describe oppressive actualizations of power, Foucault discusses the possibility for discourses to be deconstructed by understanding their historical construction (Grbich, 2007, p. 147). Several guidelines can be taken from Foucault on deconstructing discourses: tracking the discourses’ historical development; identifying constituents in terms of objects, statements, themes, and so on; finding discontinuity, disunity, and limits in discourse; looking at an idea’s dispersion; and locating challenges to the societal discourse (Grbich, 2007, p. 150). Importantly, Foucault does not assert that power is inherently oppressive, but rather that it is always accompanied by resistance, which, like power, “circulates in discourse\" (Jagose, 1996, pp. 80–81). This thesis uses Foucault’s guidelines on deconstructing discourses to frame the analysis of the current policy and practice landscape that impact queer refugees and asylum seekers. While the notion of everyday peace is used to explore the challenges to mainstream discourses, it is also concerned with the creation of alternate discourses.   40 Ethical Considerations  Among this research’s ethical considerations was the potential psychological distress of the interview participants. Refugees often carry stories of the violence and trauma they have experienced, which can vicariously impact advocates and service providers, particularly those who work in a clinical setting (Barrington & Shakespeare-Finch, 2013). A distress protocol was approved by the Western Sydney University Human Ethics Research Committee, and mental health resources were provided for the interviewees to contact if needed.  Another key consideration was the confidentiality of interviewees. As refugee policy has become increasingly contentious, the consequences for those who expose conditions in detention centers can be extreme. The Border Force Act of 2015, last updated in 2020, prohibits the disclosure of Immigration and Border Protection information by service providers without authorization. Violations are punishable with jail time of up to two years (Home Affairs, 2020). Although this research is not intended to gather identifying information on individuals in detention centers, the potential remains for harassment of participants if confidentiality is broken. For this reason, all identifying information from interviews has been altered to obscure details, but without changing the meaning of the data. Interviewees were asked to choose a pseudonym. Those that did not, were assigned one based on their self-identified gender and ethnicity. Additionally, information about the participants, including the date of interview and pseudonyms has been kept on a separate hard drive from audio recordings, transcripts, and analysis of transcripts. Only members of the research team have access to the raw data.   41 The last major anticipated ethical consideration was the potential to overshadow the voices of lived experience. As I am not from a refugee background, it is important that someone who is be given a meaningful way to guide the research. One of the project’s reflexive practices was to assemble a steering committee to advise the research process. The steering committee was composed of the academic supervisory team, a migration service provider, a queer former asylum seeker, and a mental health counselor and met twice between August and November to give input on the framing and prioritizing of the research findings. This research was approved by the Western Sydney University Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval number H14165).    42   Chapter 4: Research Findings and Discussion In this chapter, the findings from both the policy review and interviews with practitioners are analyzed. The chapter is divided into four sections based on the themes that emerged from the data. The first discusses the lack of gender and sexuality sensitivity in both policy and practice. The second sections details ways that risk is created. In the third section, the strategies described for creating safety to counter these risks are explored. The final section discusses additional systematic changes that are needed to support peaceful outcomes for queer refugees and asylum seekers.  Section 1: Limited Recognition of Gender and Sexuality in Displacement One of the main findings from both the policy review and interviews was an overall lack of focus on queer people and their experiences in migration processes. Within the national policies analyzed, gender and sex comprised a minority of codes. When gender and sex were mentioned, it was in relation to defining family, specifically partner relationships, the right to have someone of the same sex perform a strip search, the ability of a doctor to forgo a chest x-ray on a pregnant person, the Women at Risk Visa, and in defining the limits of the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984. Additionally, sexuality and gender are specifically separated from other aspects of migration policy, in ways that deprioritize it. When either is mentioned for the purposes of inclusivity, cis-heteronormative standards are still used. Mention of gender and  43 sexuality also tended to appear along codes for trauma and the role of service providers. This lack of attention to gender and sexuality was reflected in services, resulting in reliance on informal resources by queer people. Some differences were noted in the ways asylum seekers versus refugees interact with these services. 1A: Marginalization of Gender and Sexuality  The Migration Policy and Operational Contents, formerly known as the Procedures Advice Manual 3 (PAM3), which sets forth guidelines for processing visa applications across visa types, notes that under s507 of the Commonwealth Migration Act 1958, the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 (SDA) does not apply to migration regulations that deal with “the nature of a relationship or the period for which a relationship must have existed to be a partner relationship” (PAM3: GenGuideA, 2020). The SDA is the primary document in Australia that prohibits discrimination based on “sex, gender identity, intersex status, sexual orientation, marital or relationship status, family responsibilities, because they are pregnant or might become pregnant or because they are breastfeeding” (Australian Human Rights Commission, n.d.). The exclusion of the SDA not only removes protections from the migration process on a procedural level, but also discursively marks migration policy as separate from the rest of Australian policy by establishing a different set of rights for non-citizens. It establishes the state as the interpreter of gender, sex, intersex status, and relationships through a less sensitive lens when dealing with migration versus other social processes. At the same time, gender is very much at play throughout policy. One example is in the use of pronouns. When given pronouns, ministers are referred to as “he”, while pregnant people are referred to as “she”, reinforcing both male authority and cis-normativity.   44 1B: Nominal Inclusion, Paradoxical Practice   The Migration Act acknowledges some diversity in gender and sexual orientation, at least nominally. It allows for the fear of prosecutions for gender or sexual orientation to be included as grounds for which a person can claim to be a refugee, including when a person is forced to “enter into or remain in a marriage to which that person is opposed, or accept the forced marriage of a child” or “alter his or her sexual orientation or gender identity or conceal his or her true sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status” (Migration Act 1958, 2021, pts. 1; 5J).  However, at the same time, the language used to define “a particular social group,” the category under which cases of persecution based on gender and sexuality are typically processed (Connely, 2014, p. 5), holds deeply essentialist connotations. The definition acknowledges membership in a social group if \"a characteristic is shared by each member of the group\" and a person shares or is perceived to share that characteristic. Additionally, the characteristic must be \"an innate or immutable characteristic…so fundamental to a member's identity or conscience, the member should not be forced to renounce it…or the characteristic distinguishes the group from society (Migration Act 1958, 2021, pt. 1: 5L).  The idea of gender as a fixed or immutable characteristic contrasts with understandings of the socially constructed and performative nature of gender (Butler, 1999), and such essentialist views of gender tend to further gender-based oppression (Dzubinski & Diehl, 2018; Simm, 2005). Likewise, queer identities within the same cultural context vary widely from each other. Queerness is defined largely by being outside the realm of cultural norms of gender, relationship, and body, rather than holding a particular shared characteristic. This  45 determination embeds significant power in the state agent making this decision over an individual’s or family's life. It also places that agent in the position of making determinations about the nature of characteristics that are embedded in a different cultural landscape and the feelings and beliefs relating to a person's own self, furthering the narrative that they assert about both in precedent. The impossibility of this task, even for an agent who may have positive feelings towards queer refugees, has likely contributed to the historical trend for asylum cases to be denied based on the idea that queer people could simply hide their gender or sexuality. A 2003 Sydney Law Review article notes that at the time of the study, “one-third of Australian cases considered whether applicants could avoid persecution by hiding their sexuality” (Dauvergne & Millibank, 2003). These critiques are not new. In 1994, Victoria Foote wrote of the problems women refugees faced in trying to prove persecution based on being members of a particular social group. She wrote of the patriarchal lens through which the Refugee Convention is written and how women are disempowered and simultaneously subcategorized and homogenized in the use of the definition. Foote comments:  The gender-neutral language of the Convention definition is deceptive. Hidden in the neutrality is an understanding of persecution, and the grounds upon which it is legally based, that has been formulated by a distinctly male perception of what constitutes a legitimate fear of persecution. (Victoria Foote, 1994, p. 8)  Almost thirty years later, the same binary, essentialist, and patriarchal lens underlines the definitions in the Convention and in the Australian Migration Act, even though the interpretation of a “particular social group” has been expanded to be nominally inclusive of queer refugees. This highlights that inclusivity of queer experiences requires an overhaul of  46 language that has shaped refugee systems, rather than simply adding small notes in interpretation.  Another example is that nominal inclusion is found in defining family. The definition of a ‘partner’ or ‘spouse’ specifies that a partner can be of the same or different sex. However, the criteria for deciding what constitutes a partnership centre around factors that may be difficult to prove for people who have previously hidden the nature of their relationships for fear of persecution. These include shared finances or property, shared housing, exclusivity in the relationship, whether or not the couple has children together, the length of the relationship, and whether or not the couples’ social networks recognize their relationship (Migration Act 1958, 2021, pt. 1: 5F).  Additionally, many of the sections that define family relationships embed an expectation of hierarchy within the family structure. Most of the sections coded under \"defining family\" deal with children and tend to define them and their rights in terms of their dependency on an adult. However, this hierarchy is not limited to children. The phrase \"family head\" is used multiple times and positions one person as representing the family unit and  basing the states recognition of legitimacy to that person. PAM3 specifically states: \"regardless of whether the person who satisfies primary criteria is an applicant or already holds that class of visa, eligibility of any person to be a family unit member of that person derives from their relationship to that person as (nominal) family head\" (PAM3: GenGuideA, 2020). Although gender is not assigned to the head of the family, it is difficult to separate the term from its historical use that assumes the position is filled by a man (Rosenthal & Marshall, 1986).  47 Assumptions about gender and power within family structures are also evident in the criteria for the “Woman at Risk” visa, which states, “If the applicant meets the requirements of paragraph 204.211(1)(a), the Minister is satisfied that the applicant does not have the protection of a male relative and is in danger of victimisation, harassment or serious abuse because of her sex” (Migration Regulations 1994, 2022, sec. 204). This language places male relatives as keepers of a woman’s safety, with the state essentially stepping in to fill the role of providing protection in the absence of a male relative.  Even in offering protection, this section objectifies women and reinforces patriarchal dynamics within the family, while ignoring the complex ways that gendered violence may surface towards women and the variety of ways that male relatives may or may not themselves be complicit or even powerless. Gender-based violence occurs in many forms and is not limited simply to the dynamic of whether or not a male can serve as a protector. Moreover, in defining limitations of partner visas, the Migration Regulations prevent the former partner of someone on a \"Woman at Risk\" visa from obtaining a partner visa, assuming firstly that perpetrators of gender-based violence are limited to partners and also that the partner was a \"male person\" (Migration Regulations 1994, 2022, sec. 309.212).  1C: Sex, Trauma, and Service Providers: The Gendered Trio Other instances of intentionally gendered language in migration policy exhibit a deep connection between gender, trauma, and bodily autonomy. Requirements to have a person of the same sex conduct strip searches and protections for pregnant people (referred to as “she”) had some of the most frequent cross-coding with gender, as well as with trauma and the role of  48 service providers. The other most frequent codes that appeared under trauma were “detention” and “deportation\". In all cases, trauma appeared in connection to control of space in terms of both when bodies are moved and when bodies are invaded. The association between the appearance of gender and sex with processes that enact authority on bodies is hardly surprising. Butler writes that, just as gender is culturally constructed, “the body itself is a construction” (Butler, 1999, p. 13). Bodies, like gender, are part of and subject to discourse and sites in which power dynamics take shape. It is notable that service providers, particularly medical professionals, are often associated with these acts. The policy review demonstrates the authority of the state enacted over refugees' bodies rests with non-ministerial staff, such as medical personnel or detention facility workers.  In both strip searches and medical exams, gender and sex are invoked to offer protection, either from being searched by someone of a different sex or by undergoing procedures that are harmful during pregnancy. However, in neither case does this protection question or prevent the authority of the bodily invasion. In fact, the Migration Act authorizes whatever an agent believes to be an appropriate use of force, even in conducting identification tests (Migration Act 1958, 2021, sec. 13AA).  1D: Parallels in Practice As in policy, many interviewees expressed a lack of acknowledgment of gender and sexuality in their workplaces. Out of seven interviewees, one participant had never had a client disclose that they were queer. Another has only had one queer client despite working for a major resettlement organization. In both cases, the interviewees said gender and sexuality were rarely  49 recorded or brought up by their service outside of binary \"male\" and \"female\" labels. A third interviewee, who has worked in several refugee spaces, reported that only in mental health spaces has she encountered clients who disclosed that they are queer and discussed the way that their gender or sexuality impacts their life. Family violence was mentioned as one of the few spaces where gender is proactively discussed. However, those that brought it up also felt staff training around understanding gendered violence, even when those involved are cisgender and heterosexual, was inadequate. They also commented on how discussions of family violence still center around cis-normative and heteronormative expectations of violence. One participant noted that when a non-binary client experienced family violence, the state-wide training did not seem applicable. Additionally, the guidelines described by interviewees still focused on partner relationships, specifically violence inflicted by male partners towards women.  Multiple interviewees were concerned about a lack of data being collected on gender and sexuality orientations on a broad level. One commented on how queer refugees and asylum seekers are still not accounted for in the national census. Another interviewee described many layers of removal between advocates in health care and patients who are receiving medical care in detention. Although this interviewee described their colleagues as allies and deeply dedicated to patient advocacy, they have no way to assess how someone’s queer identity may impact their risks in detention due to this lack of data. Because it is not being discussed on a basic level, spaces such as hospitals that could be a safer place for queer people to share their  50 circumstances as compared to detention facilities are not opened, and potential risks based on gender and sexuality are not taken into account in determining asylum seekers’ safety.  The other four interviewees reported working frequently with queer refugees and asylum seekers, though some also expressed concern that queer people were not getting gender-sensitive care in other spaces. All of them described ways that they pro-actively discuss gender and sexual orientation, including during intake processes or in the ways they publicly discuss their work. All four of these interviewees also have a queer/LGBTQ identity, and three of them are people of colour. Three of the four described letting their clients know that they are in the LGBTQ community and consider this important for building trust with their clients. Their responses highlight the importance of personal connection between providers and clients as well as the role of proactively discussing the ways that gender, sexuality, and race impact clients’ lives.  It is also notable that three out of these four participants are connected to organizations that are related to mental health. As with the other respondents who only found queer people \"inviting in\" service providers in mental health services, these responses indicate that mental health services create safety in ways that other services do not. Overall, the lack of gender and sexuality sensitivity in policy is reflected in practice. One interviewee states: \"I don't see it in any of our process that we are having any kind of discussions about sexuality or gender, other than, like a mere sentence that everyone's equal in Australia under the law\" (Anna, 2022).  However, as in policy, this lack of focus does not mean that gender and sexual orientation are neutral concepts. Rather, they are cis-heteronormative assumptions, as exemplified in the  51 discussion on family violence. Assumptions of binary, heteronormativity and cis-normativity prevail as the lens through which service providers interact with their clients unless there is an intentional exploration of how gender and sexuality are at play in clients' lives. Several participants described clients not receiving necessary support because of these assumptions, and with a lack of data and policy on queer refugees and asylum seekers, programming that supports their needs specifically is not instituted in most organizations. When it is, funding for it is often not prioritized. All interviewees expressed the need for a greater focus on queer refugees and asylum seekers. Several believed that specifically naming aspects of diversity such as gender, sexuality, and refugee status in policy would help prioritize greater sensitivity in practice. Additionally, interviewees stressed the importance of bringing queer refugees and asylum seekers into the policy-making process and including intersectional perspectives in all components of, rather than only in limited sections. Irma commented: “to create necessary change in the policy framework, you need to actually have every policy that engages Australian society at large recognize diversity in all its forms, and needs to be able to cater to their diversity” (Irma, 2022). One interviewee gave an example of how this is being done, citing the NSW Multicultural Programs and Services Program (MPSP), which provides a framework for requiring services to show how they are meeting the needs of diverse communities (Multicultural NSW, 2022). However, the interviewee was not aware of any similar policy on a national level.  1E: Informal Spaces as Primary Spaces  52 The importance of referral processes was mentioned by every interviewee. Service providers’ personal knowledge still accounts for many of the appropriate referrals made. However, some described how they have been able to successfully advocate for a client they knew was queer. One interviewee described the importance of talking to the person to whom she referred a queer client before connecting them. Doing so ensured that the provider would be welcoming and reduced the clients’ need to explain their queer identity and story all over again. While information about gender or sexuality should only be disclosed with the client's permission, this example highlights how screening referrals and taking time to educate referred providers can facilitate a more appropriate referral process.  However, overall, a lack of an official referral systems for queer-specific issues was noted. In the absence of programming for their needs, several interviewees described their queer refugee and asylum seeker clients finding services through informal means, such as social media, word of mouth, or by seeing someone speak at a public event. One participant said that most of her clients find her by word of mouth and are often very fearful of being associated with an LGBTQ organization, so person-to-person referrals provide more safety.  Other means of accessing client services involved expanding services into communities or homes by sharing information in community spaces. One interviewee mentioned that referring clients to services with face-to-face or home visits helped them receive personalized attention and care compared to other settings. In addition, support groups were one of the main ways discussed that LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers were able to connect each other to services, including gender-affirming care, legal support, and sexual and reproductive health care.   53 Reliance on informal networks highlights a lack of support in formal spaces. However, it also showcases an important strength that has been developed within communities and with allies in service provisions. The function of support groups in referrals is particularly interesting as they act as a bridge between community-sourced or informal knowledge and formal spaces, where organizational resources can support the sharing of that knowledge. Such structures present opportunities for a community’s strengths to be incorporated into organizations that do not offer queer refugee-friendly services.  All three examples—support groups, home visits, and word-of-mouth referrals—showcase a blurring of the boundaries between formal spaces that conduct the bureaucracy of resettlement and home/community environments. While more development of referral networks within formal spaces was advocated in interviews, these findings also suggest that encouraging community-based outreach and programming is important when connecting with queer refugees and asylum seekers. Dissolving borders between organizations and communities also means entering communities. Such a change requires that service providers adapt to the norms of the community, instead of community members adapting to the norms of the organization.  1F: Asylum Seekers versus Refugees A few differences were noted in how asylum seekers versus refugees connected with service providers. Most interviewees were more aware of queer asylum seekers than refugees, particularly when the asylum claim was based on gender or sexuality. Moreover, there was a sense that people whose asylum claim is regarding their gender or sexual orientation are more likely to talk about it because it is already part of their case, and they are visibly outside of  54 gender and sexual norms already. One interviewee describes the difficulty of reaching a man whom she believes is queer but who is not ready to connect with queer communities:  I think he's not ready. Or he's not in that space, or that kind of circle. He's still new, and he's still learning. And at the same time, I don't even know whether he's accepted to be a part of the LGBTQI [community]. (Marie Chrystal, 2022) However, one interviewee who works mostly in mental health spaces, reported far more refugees discussing their queer identities than asylum seekers. This interviewee attributed this trend to asylum seekers’ many competing struggles with their visa status, whereas refugees with stable visas could dedicate more time to discussing their gender and sexuality in therapy sessions. This interviewee also expressed that most clients have not shared their gender or sexuality with their families or wider communities. These observations highlight that many factors impact how clients discuss their intersecting identities with service providers, and which providers they \"invite in\" to different aspects of their lives. It is clear that queer refugees are present, but their gender and sexuality are not identified by general services. Mental health services appear to present an exception. No interviewees discussed asylum seekers whose claim is not connected to gender or sexuality, so it is unclear how asylum seekers whose claims are based on other forms of persecution, but who also happen to be queer, navigate services. Section 2: Risk Creation Many interviewees discussed the ways that intersecting marginal identities led to a greater risk of danger, exploitation, mental health problems, and criminalization. At the same time, resettlement policy creates a significant threat of criminalization and deportation. Together, they create a system that excludes queer refugees and asylum seekers by creating traps of deportability, in addition to making conditions of exclusion and marginalization within the borders of Australia.  55 2A: Isolation and Mental Health Mental health challenges were also discussed by every interviewee, the most commonly mentioned were depression, stress, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Several interviewees described complex traumas, a series of traumatic events or repeated events (World Health Organization, 2022), that their clients faced, including before they left their countries of origin, in transit, in detention, and living in Australia. As Marwa commented:  If that person is a refugee, but they've been tortured in their country for political reasons or something, and they come here and they are starting a new life and all that it's it has its challenges, and there's a lot of trauma behind it. But if we add on top of that, their sexuality as well, then there is we're dealing with two traumas together and added layer of trauma on top of the trauma that they've been suffering from and all the nightmares, all the flashbacks, all that stress. (Marwa, 2022) Detention conditions leading to both physical and mental health problems were mentioned by multiple interviewees. One interviewee stated that it can take months to see a mental health professional in detention centers, and International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), the organization contracted to provide health services in detention centers, can deny medication without a medical reason. Moreover, nurses rather than doctors can approve visits from specialists. The interviewee said that because the detention conditions themselves create and exacerbate mental health problems, the only viable treatment in detention centers is medication, which can also have side effects.  Several interviewees discussed ways that queer refugees and asylum seekers may experience emotional barriers that prevent them from using resources even when they exist. Among them were the severe effects of trauma that make it difficult to work. Residual shame and fear of being stereotyped also prevent people from seeking services. One interviewee described a situation where a queer client was afraid to call a suicide hotline because they had  56 been sent to conversion therapy in the past and were afraid of being involuntarily institutionalized if they used the hotline. These findings suggest that service providers should be prepared to offer repeated assurances and pay attention to ways that queer people may have additional traumas from institutional structures. Interviewees said that isolation from their communities or families was extremely common and damaging for their clients’ wellbeing. For those whose families do not know they are queer, continuing to try to hide their identity was reported as creating significant stress. Unsurprisingly, establishing chosen family was highlighted as a critical factor in creating connections and support and easing mental health challenges. However, several interviewees described difficulties in finding community because of discrimination from both white-dominated queer spaces and their cultural communities. Several interviewees expressed concern about trauma and poor mental health contributing to unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as drug use, as well as interruptions to work and keeping up with services. Due to the prevalence of complex trauma among queer refugees and asylum seekers, the risk of falling through the cracks in social services or of developing unsafe or criminalized coping mechanisms is a particular concern. Additionally, safeguards that are usually found in family or community support can be more difficult for queer refugees to develop. Literature on the trauma histories of incarcerated women finds strong relationships between the connection between trauma, gendered violence, and criminalization, with incarcerated women having high rates of past trauma and abuse (Moloney et al., 2009). Though Moloney and colleagues do not draw causality between trauma and criminalization, they  57 suggest that trauma contributes to conditions of precariousness and advocate that “facilitating trauma healing will, for the majority of imprisoned women, interrupt the cascade of events which culminate in criminality by eliminating the need for coping mechanisms and by improving health and social outcomes” (Moloney et al., 2009). Parallels can be drawn between these findings and the concerns of interviewees in this project that suggest service providers must prioritize mental health needs when working with queer refugees.  2B: Challenges in Basic Services Most interviewees raised challenges that their clients face in accessing basic services, including financial instability. Affordable legal support and education were named as particularly difficult to access by multiple interviewees, especially when prior education credits are not recognized in Australia.  The lack of rights to work rights for asylum seekers was a major source of instability mentioned. Multiple interviewees remarked that clients often have to prioritize working over seeking mental health care or accessing services. Finding jobs that will hire people who do not have permanent residency is another challenge. One interviewee noted that regional areas often have better job prospects but very limited access to services. Application processing fees also pose an immense barrier to asylum seekers. In one example, concerns were raised about a client working beyond a healthy amount to cover the cost of bringing their partner to come to Australia. Additionally, while asylum seekers pay taxes as residents, they are ineligible for many government benefits, such as the extra increments that were available during the COVID 19 pandemic (Rumi, 2022). Certain benefits are only for families or people with children, which are  58 less likely to include queer families. One interviewee remarked: “For tax purposes, you are the resident. For everything else you're not” (Rumi, 2022). Rumi’s observation highlights how policy includes marginalized people when it is in the state’s interest and excludes them when offering support and creating hierarchies in belonging.  The availability of affordable housing that is safe for queer clients, particularly in shared housing, was a significant concern among interviewees. Multiple interviewees felt that housing had been particularly neglected in the past few years, with affordable options limited even for Australian citizens. Some organizations that typically provide housing for refugees have been known to discriminate against queer people. One interviewee was aware of multiple cases of asylum seekers and refugees being kicked out of housing provided by the Salvation Army, an international Christian charity, for being queer, one of whom died after being put out on the street. These findings from Australia echo research from North America about housing challenges for queer refugees in (Lee & Brotman, 2011).  However, some positive examples regarding housing were mentioned, including a new initiative to have LGBTQ people in a community host LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. One interviewee described another helpful organization that has LGBTQ allies within the organization, a focus on affordability, and a process for keeping in touch with residents to check on their well-being. The healthcare system was the service sector that was described as having had the most change towards inclusive practice. However, one interviewee who works in healthcare said that a hierarchical structure can lead to medical professionals trying to satisfy the government rather  59 than seeing refugees as patients. Additionally, there are still gaps in coverage for asylum seekers, who are often ineligible for Medicare, Australia’s public health insurance program. One participant said this has been a particular issue for clients who have had to visit Emergency Departments for mental health crises. Multiple participants discussed the difficulty of getting gender-affirming health care for transgender refugees and asylum seekers, particularly due to cost.  Across service sectors, interviewees said that service literacy, language barriers, and excessive paperwork posed difficulties for their clients. Language barriers were discussed by several interviewees, most of whom placed high importance on them and their connection to service literacy. One interviewee gave the example that even finding the correct words to do a Google search for services posed challenges for many with whom she works.  However, within client interactions, not all interviewees found language barriers to be a problem. One participant said that developing emotional safety was a higher priority than having perfect interpretations, and that many clients prefer to use broken English than have an interpreter present because they feel less comfortable having another person there. In some cases, the same interviewee also described using the clients’ own language if they knew some of it. These accounts demonstrate that challenges with language barriers can be reduced by having people in service provisions who have cultural and linguistic connections to their clients and by having attitudes of patience and creativity.  Aside from general language proficiency, interviewees also discussed the ways that different terminology around queer identities could pose challenges. In some cases, the common word to  60 describe someone’s identity in their language may not translate well or may be derogatory. However, one interviewee who has worked in interpreting said that these kinds of challenges are unnecessary in live interpreting. She described her process of navigating words that do not translate directly, saying that it is possible to simply describe the meaning of the words.  Unlike in cases where they were unable to mitigate language barriers with interpersonal skills or communication style, interviewees unequivocally described their clients’ difficulties with written communication. One interviewee noted that an emphasis is placed on written documentation during the immigration process and was concerned that meanings may be lost during translation. Similarly, several interviewees described the administrative aspects of the immigration process as deeply challenging due to language barriers and the emotional vulnerability of trying to tell persecution stories. They described providing basic documentation as extremely difficult, with every layer of paperwork creating challenges. One example given was that, in a country of origin, if someone applies for a passport, it will flag that they are trying to leave the country and prompt investigation, which can increase the danger to them. It was also noted that many people feel afraid to disclose their experiences relating to gender and sexuality on official documents because they are accustomed to discrimination; even short written statements require extra reassurances of their safety.  These administrative processes were heavily inscribed throughout the policy review. Under codes dealing with ways refugees and asylum seekers may become noncompliant with their visa requirements, processes requiring paperwork were the most common and also most often cross-coded with \"impacts on family members.\" Several sections of policy prioritize written  61 communication requirements, and there are serious consequences if a person is unable to follow these guidelines. Within PAM3, there is recognition that “a considerable amount of communication about the processing of an application takes place by phone,” and officials are meant to take notes on their phone calls. However, the responsibility to include details in a case ultimately lies with the applicant and they must be in writing. This requirement is framed as a protective measure to ensure that information is not missed, but the data from interviews indicates that in actuality it creates challenges.  This emphasis on written communication juxtaposed with interviewees’ concerns about language barriers affecting compliance with the immigration process fits with the historical context of language barring migration of people from non-Western contexts. Linguist Laura Smith-Khan writes about the way that language tests have historically been used to discriminate against people of colour in the Australian migration process (Smith-Khan, 2015). The data from this research indicates a continuation of written documentation requirements and language barriers creates unequal access to migration processes and the continuation of marginalization through procedure, even without policy explicitly naming any particular demographic. Likewise, it reinforces Jupp’s writing on inequality and discrimination within policy, even with less explicitly racialized language (Jupp, 2007, p. 63). 2C: Risk of Abuse Multiple interviewees discussed the ways that having less support often results in relying on risky or unsafe circumstances or individuals. One example includes an individual who had developed a problem with drug use after becoming homeless and moving in with a friend who  62 was using drugs. Exploitation was another concern expressed by interviewees. They also noted how many asylum seekers work cash-in-hand jobs because of restricted work rights, making them more vulnerable to abuse by their employers. Many also experience housing instability, which can lead to sleeping rough. These conditions make it far more likely to end up in the criminal justice system and therefore become deportable.  Abuse from family members was raised, both as a part of some queer refugees’ and asylum seekers' histories, as well as in their current living situations. One interviewee noted that race plays a significant role in situations of intimate partner violence, particularly when clients are romantically involved with white Australians. The interviewee described situations where white partners have threatened to get their partner in trouble with immigration or get them deported. Additionally, the interviewee stated that the police had not been helpful in these types of cases, and many of the clients who had experienced family violence do not feel comfortable talking to police and court magistrates or perusing legal cases in institutions with a that have a \"white environment.\" Sections addressing family violence in the Migration ACT allow for some interpretation of who is considered the victim of family violence, but it is still tied to partner or spousal relationships, which may not account for other types of family violence directed at queer people. Outside of spousal or partner relationships, the Act focuses on dependency to define the family that can be considered to engage in family violence, and ultimately leaves a Minister to determine if family violence took place.  2D: Surveillance and Suspicion   63 In the policy review, methods of surveillance and criminalization closely followed \"requires paperwork\" in frequency under codes dealing with ways someone could become uncompliant with their visa. For the purpose of this policy review, surveillance methods included the recording of personal identifying information, collecting information that may be used to track location, compliance with regulations, or criminalization, including activity that is seen to preclude criminal activity. Some examples include searches of people, aircraft or ships and medical exams, identity checks, and reporting requirements relating to reporting physical addresses or checking into an office periodically.  Surveillance measures were often associated with the idea of criminality, as seen in section 336L: Identifying information may be indefinitely retained if the non-citizen to whom it relates: (a) is, or has ever been, in immigration detention; or (b) has ever had an application for a visa refused, or has ever had a visa cancelled; or (c) has ever: (i) entered Australia on a temporary visa; and (ii) since its expiry, remained in Australia as an unlawful non-citizen; or (d) has ever been convicted of an offence against this Act or the regulations; or (e) has ever been subject to action taken under this Act or the regulations for the purpose of: (i) deporting the non-citizen; or (ii) removing the non-citizen from Australia; or (f) is a person in respect of whom the Minister has issued a conclusive certificate under subsection (4). (Migration Act 1958, 2021, sec. 336L) This section of the Act essentially makes the circumstance of coming to Australia as an asylum seeker sufficient reason to retain sensitive information about the seeker by associating them with criminality.  The policy review also yielded a strong connection between surveillance and everyday activity and basic living needs. Housing was the code that most commonly appeared under surveillance techniques when comparing state processes and potential impacts, followed closely by finances and education. These everyday connections to surveillance expand the states'  64 power into homes, creating a border-like system in which people become tethered to a place, and movement throughout the state is regulated. Moreover, the normalization of surveillance into everyday life points to the axiomatic nature of violence within a broad system of structural violence within the state (Pipyrou & Sorge, 2021).  Such normalization also reflects historical colonial patterns, in which surveillance is embedded in migration programs. In her book, Dark Matters (2015), Simone Browne details how the modern passport, a critical document for most trans-national migration, descends from records that were used to track enslaved persons who had been granted access to board British ships following the American War of Independence (Browne, 2015, pp. 69–74). Browne draws several important conclusions form this history, including that this process established a national border between the US and Canada, which were then no longer simply two British colonies. More importantly, she writes that this systems exemplifies how “surveillance of black Atlantic mobilities” was part of this establishment of the border, and indeed, the very use of passport-like documents to control migration (Browne, 2015, p. 69). Interviewees did not mention surveillance itself. However, suspicion was said to be felt throughout the immigration process, with refugees being viewed as untrustworthy or being likened to criminals and constantly having to prove how they are persecuted. Interviewees said that many asylum seekers are put into difficult positions of proving their queerness against unrealistic and often stereotypical standards. One example provided was transgender asylum seekers feeling pressured to obtain costly gender-affirming care to prove that they are transitioning. Multiple interviewees discussed questions steeped in Western bias, such as why  65 asylum seekers did not use apps like Grinder to meet people, or why they have not come out to their families as queer. These findings are consistent with prior literature on the treatment of asylum claims within Western contexts that find asylum seekers, particularly transgender people, are treated with suspicion and judged using a Western, cisgender, stereotypical lens when determining their status (Akin, 2019; Lalsinghani, 2018; LaViolette, 2013; Lee & Brotman, 2011; Millbank, 2009). One interviewee provided strong examples of cases where a queer person does not disclose their LGBTQ status in initial interviews, and revealing it later leads to being treated with suspicion or being unable to include it as one of the reasons they faced persecution. However, many are uncomfortable disclosing their LGBTQ status in initial interviews. Kenesse commented: “Because you know, you're coming to a country, you don't speak English, and they're asking you these personal questions, where these personal questions could kill you, or put you in jail if they're asked by your government. So how would you respond?” (Kenesse, 2022). In several cases, communication from immigration authorities was described as threatening, making it difficult to engage with them. One interviewee used an example of a client who, for years, received letters stating that they would be deported if they did not comply every time a request came for information. Multiple interviewees discussed increased anxiety and even panic attacks in clients who were experiencing their immigration interviews. Moreover, communication from immigration authorities can be confusing and was described as un-streamlined.   66 Several examples of migrants and refugees being treated with suspicion are present in policy, including suspicion of trying to cheat the immigration process and of criminality or terrorism. In one example, communication requirements are framed as preventing abuse by applicants:  …this ensures that an applicant cannot jeopardies the lawfulness of a decision by sending relevant information to another office with the intention that it not be available and thereby provide grounds for judicial review on the ground of a failure to take account of relevant information on the basis that it was held by the department. (PAM3: GenGuideA, 2020)  Similarly, various visa conditions applied to asylum seekers limit activities based on assumptions that they could be used for violence, such as working with certain chemicals or operating flights.  2E: Criminalization Criminalization, both as an outcome of migration processes and as a determinant of well-being, arose throughout the policy review and interviews with practitioners. The very decision of whether to pursue refugee status or seek asylum directly was influenced by the accessibility of migration systems to queer people. One interviewee recounted that she has had clients whom local UNHCR staff refused to help with applications or even file them because they were queer. In one instance, a client was outed by a UNHCR clerk in front of a room full of people in a country where it was illegal to be gay. Even though the UNHCR has committed to protecting queer refugees, de facto discrimination has pushed clients to travel to Australia as asylum seekers, including via unauthorized routes, which is far more dangerous, can make them subject to detention and affords them fewer rights once they are in Australia  67 Within the policy review, several trends in criminalization are notable. First, visa conditions that can lead to someone becoming uncompliant with their visa requirements are most often applied to asylum seekers, particularly those on bridging visas. As with surveillance, criminalization was often cross-coded in the policy analysis with education, housing, and finances and also frequently associated with visa refusal and cancellation. Financial penalties were often associated with work restrictions, paying fines, and covering the costs of one's own detention. Not only do these penalties further the financial hardship that can lead to someone violating work restrictions, but they also position the migrant as responsible for the costs or “violation.” These fees are used retributively, even when it is the state imposing the costs, as in detention.  Section 501 of the Migration Act was specifically discussed by interviewees as creating a strong racial bias in deportation based on criminalization. The Section allows for detention and deportation based on a character test, which was described as highly subject to interpretation and predominantly used to detain and deport people of colour. One interviewee stated: “The bias that exists within the Migration Act, particularly around non-western people and white people…I mean, they might as well call it the, you know, the White Australia Act again, because that's basically what it's sort of prioritizing that certain group” (Kenesse, 2022). The need for an overhaul of the entire Migration Act was brought up by one interviewee to fully address racial bias, a sentiment reflected in earlier findings about the need for policy to be created with attention to inclusion and diversity from the start instead of trying to make patchwork amendments to policies engrained in bias. As in the analysis of racial bias in state-mandated communication requirements, these sections demonstrate that policies need not explicitly  68 name race to be applied in deeply racialized ways through procedure and through cultural stereotypes of criminality and deviance. Significant attention has rightfully been paid to punitive conditions imposed on asylum seekers for entering Australia in unauthorized ways (Refugee Action Coalition, 2021). However, most of the sections coded under criminalization were unrelated to legal status based on the way that the person entered the country. For example, Section 500A of the Migration Act lists numerous reasons that someone on a Temporary Safe Haven Visa can have a visa refused or canceled. A Minister simply has to suspect that a person has an association with a criminal or criminal group, might engage in criminal activity, would be disruptive to Australian society, would \"vilify a segment of the Australian community\", and so on (Migration Act 1958, 2021, sec. 500A). These reasons are deeply subjective, particularly, in that they can be based on suspicion of future behavior rather than actual behavior. This interpretation reflects the process in which the ideas and narratives about a person or group become inseparable from the legal and political reality enacted on them.  This finding is consistent with scholarship on “crimingration,” the use of criminalization to exclude or punish migrants, that acknowledges the deep connectedness in the criminal justice system and migration system such that ”criminal law and immigration law require each other” (Finnane & Kaladelfos, 2019, p. 21). Certainly, there is still a need to deconstruct and challenge the labels of \"authorized\" versus \"unauthorized,\" but these findings suggest that it is equally important to address the way that everyday criminal law is applied, especially given the  69 previous findings on ways that queer refugees and asylum seekers are made vulnerable to criminalization.  Section 3: Safety Creation Even more than specific policies, interviewees focused on interpersonal interactions between service providers and queer refugees and asylum seekers. Many discussions pointed to ways that these interpersonal interactions continued the precariousness and exclusion in policy into practice. While it may seem simpler to attribute these interpersonal challenges to personal shortcomings, their widespread nature suggests that they are cultural and structural in nature and point to a need for changes in attitudes and beliefs, as well as policy, to create spaces of safety. However, this emphasis on the interplay between personal behavior and structural violence demonstrates the ability of personal interactions to affect the system they are working in. Interviewees described several ways that their clients and community members have or could create safe and inclusive spaces within their institutions. 3A: Trauma Informed Communication Interviewees discussed several small shifts in communication that have had a significant impact on establishing safety. These included proactively sharing and asking for pronouns, conveying openness and care with body language, ensuring confidentiality, asking clients what they needed help with rather than assuming, and explicitly telling people that it is safe for them to use a service. Interviewees also shared numerous examples in which queer refugees and asylum seekers were made to feel unwelcome due to unfriendly or dismissive communication.  70 These differences in communication styles were described as particularly important to building trust with clients so that they could feel safe enough to share openly.  As noted in earlier findings, mental health spaces were one of the few sectors where queer refugees and asylum seekers reported feeling comfortable sharing their gender or sexual orientation with service providers. One interview elaborated that the people who make clients feel the most welcomed are those with significant experience working traumatized populations. In another example, an interviewee describes how clients would often ask to have her interpret, specifically because they trusted her more than other interpreters. Several factors stood out about this interviewee's practice, including a commitment to confidentiality and an accepting attitude towards queer people. However, she also described taking time to reassure clients if she sensed that they felt nervous and proactively demonstrating care using non-verbal communication: “It's important to make sure that I say exactly what they are saying and show the same emotions they are showing, for them to feel safe to talk and to get things out. Because when they get things out, it makes a big difference for them” (Marwa, 2022). Polyvagal theory offers an explanation of the importance of caring and trauma-informed communication. Deb Dana writes that the automatic nervous system is constantly assessing whether or not a situation is safe and consequently regulating the body (Dana, 2018). However, experiencing trauma can lead to a dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system as a person perceives ongoing threats, “which often results in hyperarousal and hypervigilance” (TIP Advisory Committee, 2013, p. 6). People who have experienced trauma may require those interacting with them to proactively signal safety as neutral or ambiguous communication can  71 signal danger. This contextualization of trauma and communication in relation to the interview data highlights the importance of trauma-informed care on a widespread level, not just in mental health spaces, particularly because queer refugees and asylum seekers have high rates of complex trauma. One interviewee noted that when someone continues to feel afraid or unaccepted while in service organizations, it can increase their risk of mental health issues and isolation. In contract, interviewees described seeing clients progress in their healing journeys after being listened to and feeling safe in relationships with service providers. 3B: Deconstructing Power Dynamics Deconstructing the typical power dynamic in service systems was another common theme. All interviewees whose clients have disclosed being queer stressed the importance of framing their relationship and putting their client in a position of power. They describe viewing their relationships as one of friendship, solidarity, or \"walking alongside\" each other.  Another interviewee cited a specific model of social work by Jim Ife that explores realigning ideals of knowledge and power, which she found useful for describing different service sectors (Ife, 1997, pp. 42–46). The interviewee emphasized the importance of having community-led programming, particularly when working with those who have experienced trauma. This type of programming requires valuing their knowledge in ways that many institutions currently do not, particularly when compared to academic knowledge or the perspective of people working in government and NGOs. One interviewee expresses the problem with only involving intermediaries in policy creation:  We can communicate things. But this is not the authentic voice of people with lived experience. And it also makes the assumption that people with lived experience don't have the knowledge that's valued as much as  72 academic knowledge. It's also assuming that they don't know what was best for them. So, it's a paternalistic approach to policy development. So, yeah, to create better policies, it's the thing of direct contact between people that lived experience and those who design policies and valuing of that lived experience as essential. knowledge (Irma, 2022) A similar sentiment was stressed by another interviewee who said it was crucial to treat clients as the experts of their lives. Other ways the interviewee discussed valuing clients' knowledge and agency included talking to them about what they experienced in their own terms, rather than trying to make them conform to the language or ideas of the provider.  I like asking people about their definitions. So, what do they think about counseling? Or what do they think about gender? What is gender? What is sexuality? What is love? What is faith? These kinds of things. What is racism?... I have observed that they are very hesitant towards talking about racism when there is a white person, but then when I proactively use the words like racism it becomes easier for them. (Rumi, 2022) Using clients’ definitions was described as helping engage with them in a way that centers their experience and helps clients speak about it more openly.  The importance of supporting self-advocacy was further discussed by multiple interviewees. One emphasized the importance of taking time to educate clients on the choices and rights they have in the law and services and to ensure their clients know they have a choice, than simply doing everything that is suggested to them by a service provider. Involving people with lived experience in policy and program development, using their own terms, and helping them understand the choices available to them all reflect different degrees to which they are in control of their migration journey. However, these all demonstrate that safety is deeply connected to agency and shows the importance of making space for clients to be active co-creators in their service experience, rather than just recipients. Even in organizations with a  73 greater power distance between providers and clients, interviewees demonstrated that pushing for greater agency where possible can have a significant impact on clients' well-being. 3C: Continuous Learning Interviewees spoke frequently about the need for service providers to find ways to understand their clients’ experiences. Many of these concerns centered around gaps in understanding of how intersecting identities impact queer refugees and asylums seekers. Interviewees described challenges in refugee and asylum seeker services, particularly with caseworkers who do not understand how gender and sexual orientation impact clients' options. In queer-centered services, challenges included staff who did not understand the history of trauma and persecution that affect their clients, visa constraints and how to work with interpreters.  Multiple interviewees were concerned about the immense gap that refugees and asylum seekers face when trying to learn how to navigate Australian systems and felt that service providers from Western backgrounds inadequately understand these challenges. Others noted the need for a deeper understanding of racism’s impact on refugees and asylum seekers. Several interviewees described blatantly racist language encountered by clients, including being told that they were not allowed into certain venues because they were not white. One provider said that for some queer refugees and asylum seekers, the level of discrimination they face in Australia is enough to make them consider if they would have been better off in their own countries. Another stated that many refugees and asylum seekers may not be prepared for the level of discrimination they face after arriving in Australia.   74 Interviewees also discussed the need to understand the culture that someone is coming from to understand how their gender or sexual orientation affects their situation, including working with clients to make sure they have what they need in their families or communities and are safe. One interviewee states: “the key is to have staff who understand the concept of cultural safety, but also how then the culture intersects with gender and sexual identity and what that means for a person” (Irma, 2022). The way queerness is spoken about was one aspect of culture that interviewees discussed. One interviewee described Western cultural  notions of being queer as \"very in your face\", whereas in other cultures it may not be talked about as directly. Multiple participants also noted that gender and sexual orientation are just one part of refugees' and asylum seekers' lives. Their priorities may not necessarily be focused on exploring gender or sexuality, and the degree to which gender and sexuality diversity impacts clients’ lives shifts depending on their situation.  Many interviewees described the importance of cultural identity and communities to their clients. This idea highlights the importance for service providers to understand the complexities of the relationships queer refugees and asylum seekers hold in their various communities, without vilifying or alienating any aspect of their identities: I think this services should understand where these people are coming from and what struggles they will have that will make life hard for them and try to help them with that, or try to find ways if they can help communicate their sexuality to their families, or how safe can they be around their families and their community and their sexuality? (Marwa, 2022) The question for service providers then is how to support queer refugee and asylum seekers in their communities, based on their needs and desires, not how to separate them from the spaces to which they feel connected.   75 Attitudes of openness and respect for the significance of queer refugee and asylum seekers' experiences were described as necessary for learning and exploring the above topics. One interviewee described the need for an \"ongoing internal journey\" among staff to evaluate their beliefs and attitudes. In some cases, gently calling in colleagues and sometimes calling them out was described as necessary for maintaining an emotionally safe organizational culture. Informal, grassroots changes promoted by allies were described as playing a role in institutional change. One interviewee stated: “You know, you find that you find allies in unlikely spaces.… You just need to be open to finding them and then engaging with them and supporting them in recognizing and supporting their role as allies” (Irma 2022). However, there were also concerns about people with lived experience taking on an unequal amount of labor in their roles, particularly when they themselves are queer, people of colour or from a non-Western country. One participant described having to educate white colleagues about the difficulties clients face trying to adjust to a Western context. This suggests a need for white service providers to become more active allies and to learn more about others' experiences. Additionally, this discussion highlights the need for education to be prioritized at an institutional level, rather than relying on the additional labour of individuals who informally educate their colleagues, or on clients. One interviewee adds that it is not the job of “an LGBTQI plus asylum seekers or refugees to educate you, it's your job to ensure that all the clients and communities are included” (Marie Chrystal, 2022). Moreover, those who do take on the labour of educating their peers, need to be compensated, recognized, and have their boundaries respected.   76 Section 4: Rethinking the Status Quo Challenges arising from both cultural and structural violence can be identified as impacting queer refugees and asylum seekers. However, there are several ways to place power and autonomy back into the hands of people with lived experience and create healing spaces inside and outside of institutions. In many cases, individuals and small groups within institutions are already carrying out these changes, and by following their frameworks, we can implement these changes on a structural level through policy.  4A: Trainings Trainings were one of the main ways discussed by interviewees that changed attitudes and behaviors within institutions. Trainings for service providers, including interpreters, on inclusive practice with queer people were reported to have had positive impacts on creating inclusive spaces. Multiple providers who felt their services did not adequately address the intersections of migration and gender and sexuality believed additional training would be helpful. Additional training may also alleviate the burden placed on providers who share lived experiences with their clients to educate their colleagues. In addition to helping service providers better understand their clients’ experiences, they can also help providers know their own rights and abilities. In one example, paramedics were told by immigration officials that they had to use physical restraints on all patients coming from detention centres. However, after receiving training on how to navigate their duty of care, some paramedics are pushing back on these orders and not using restraints based on their clinical judgment with the support of their unions. The interviewee who shared this example noted that  77 since the trainings, there are “more examples of where health professionals have been supported rather than warned” (Natasha, 2022). 4B: Addressing Violence in Policy Interviewees discussed several necessary changes to policy to end structural and physical violence towards refugees and asylum seekers, particularly those who are queer. These included ending: indefinite detention, boat turn-backs, temporary protection visas, fast-tracking visa decisions, and invasive and traumatic practices within detention settings. Suggestions included: increasing the number of humanitarian visas offered; reducing waiting times for the processing of all visas; and providing Medicare to all humanitarian visa applicants. Interviewees also discussed the need to contend with racial bias in both migration policy and policing at large and to set clear standards in policy, instead of giving Ministers virtually unchecked power over migration outcomes. The impacts of detention were a particular concern. One interviewee stated that in many cases, asylum seekers wait in detention for four or five years before the government even invites them to apply for a protection visa. Interviewees described ways that detention conditions lend themselves to trauma, abuse, and disease for any asylum seeker, and queer detainees are at a heightened risk. Research by the International Detention Coalition (IDC) echoes this, finding that queer people are at an increased risk of gender-inappropriate bodily searches and forced nudity, a lack of appropriate medical care, verbal abuse, isolation, solitary confinement and physical violence, including sexual abuse, compared to other detainees. Transgender women who are detained with men are most at risk. In some cases, detention staff  78 refuse to respond to this violence because they interpret association with queerness as “consent to rape” (International Detention Coalition, 2016, pp. 10–11).  Many interviewees discussed the ways in which a single immigration officer can impact someone’s immigration outcome with little oversight, and many stages at which one person can decide not to support someone’s application. This observation is consistent with findings from the policy review, particularly language around Ministers. Virtually every section that deals with refugees or asylum seekers’ cases involve discretion from Ministers, from deciding whether or not a pregnant person must receive a chest X-ray and whether a person has good character, to determining whether it is in the national interest to offer someone a visa (Migration Act 1958, 2021, sec. 785).  The particular focus on national interest is likewise found in virtually every set of conditions for humanitarian visas in the Migration Regulations. For example, in the Woman at Risk Visa, the Regulations state:  The Minister is satisfied that permanent settlement in Australia is the appropriate course for the applicant; and would not be contrary to the interests of Australia…The permanent settlement of the applicant in Australia would be consistent with the regional and global priorities of the Commonwealth in relation to the permanent settlement of persons in Australia on humanitarian grounds. (Migration Regulations 1994, 2022, sec. 204)  Several other ways that national policy cements control over migrants' cases by individuals include the use of fast-track decisions, which are generally not reviewable, to decide asylum cases (Migration Act 1958, 2021, pt. 7AA). Another is through the role of ombudsman detention. An ombudsman may write reports on the conditions faced by people detained for more than two years, giving them the potential to advocate for better conditions. However,  79 Ministers are not obligated to implement their recommendations (Migration Act 1958, 2021, pt. 8C), asserting top-down control, even in measures meant to offer protection to detainees.  “National interest” appeared frequently as a code in the policy review. Sections under this code tended to fall into three categories, the first were vague statements about national interest as a whole. Others were cross-coded with criminalization or suspicion of a threat, particularly language around “emergency” or “security.” Many of these pertain to components of policy that have significant repercussions, such as the cancelation of protection visas. Last, national interest was coded with sections dealing with narratives of overcrowding or capacity of the Australian community. These findings echo Walia's assertions that discursively create states of emergency or crisis to justify exclusionary policy (Walia, 2021, p. 2).  Methods of population management were also found in the language around Safe Haven Visas, which allow people to apply for another long-term visa if they conform to capitalistic goals, such as working or being in school full time and not utilizing welfare. The visa options available to those on Safe haven Visas are also tied primarily to skilled labor, essentially requiring a certain level of productivity to have hope of staying the country with stability (Department of Home Affairs, 2021).  As noted above, safety and agency are deeply connected in service sectors. However, national migration policy removes this agency and places the nexus on control of refugee and asylum seekers’ lives within the state, both in individual cases and in a broad scheme of population management. As the interviewees assert, the policy analysis data indicates that a safe, inclusive approach to migration policy would require a systematic overhaul of both  80 Australian and global migration systems, which currently center on control and the prioritization of the maintenance of white control and capitalism.  4C: Redistributing Time in Procedure Time was a common theme across interview data. Spending time with clients was described as critical to building trust and facilitating clients' ability to share openly. This includes the importance of taking time to listen to clients, getting to know them, and educating them on the choices available to them:  They don't really have to come out. You're not there to convince them. No, give them time, give them space, make them feel comfortable. Some people, they might need a bit of time for them to… actually explain what it's all about. Imagine that trauma that they…carry with them. Once [they] open up…that person will come out and say, ‘I want this, I want that. The reason why I came to your service is because I really, really need your help’. (Marie Chrystal, 2022) However, one interviewee, Anna, noted that it is extremely difficult to carve out time with clients due to a high number of caseloads, burdensome reporting requirements set by Home Affairs, and a lack of regular face-to-face contact. She noted that to get service providers to prioritize talking about how gender and sexual orientation impact a client's experience, it needs to be specifically mentioned in policies. Anna stated: “if it's not in those processes, strongly, and it's just up to the case managers, then I think it's not happening enough. Because everyone's under such a pump that you're just basically doing that kind of bare minimum many times” (Anna, 2022). Multiple participants also talked about the gap between clients' needs and the amount of time that they are entitled to services. One participant noted that the period in which his clients can access his services has expired before any of them have received a decision on their visas. Another described the difficulty that people who have been released from immigration  81 detention face when trying to establish themselves in the community. She said they are provided accommodation for a couple of weeks to a month but are then expected to live independently while learning a new language, trying to understand a completely new way of life in Australia, and dealing with mental health challenges, all of which are long-term processes. Wait times to access services were also described as a barrier. One provider noted that she has had to do significant advocacy and follow up with a counseling service in order to get a nonbinary client with a significant history of trauma to be prioritized.  Several interviewees discussed the stress that their clients endure waiting for years in detention, on bridging and temporary visas without any assurance that they will be granted asylum. Even those on refugee visas have often spent decades living in displacement (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2017). Foucault writes about the use of time in punitive systems, describing how incarceration creates a system that “no longer punishes through the body or through goods, but through time to live\" (Foucault, 2018, p. 72). As it stands, the use of time in migration policy reflects a punitive framework used to penalize border crossing, but time is also critical for trust and relationship building in services. A redistribution of time is necessary within policy to both end punishment for seeking safety, but also to create safety once a person has entered the country.  4D: Replacing Contracted Services Several challenges identified in previous sections of this analysis reflect the shortcomings of contracted services, including fragmentation. Multiple interviewees noted that there are minimal spaces that specifically assist people in the intersections of queerness and  82 displacement. As a result, few refugee services meet their needs based on their different aspects of identity.  Another concern was the lack of accountability for contractors engaging with queer refugees and asylum seekers. These were most often discussed in relation to detention centers and interpreters. One interviewee described horrific situations of medical neglect of detainees. However, because IHMS is a contracted service, there is little oversight by the government. One interviewee mentioned rumors that interpreters in detention centers were collecting information about queer clients, activists, and people who opposed their governments and sending it back to their home countries. This rumor, whether true or not, has resulted in detainees withholding information during their interviews, as clients do not trust the interpreters. Outside of detention centres, interviewees frequently cited challenges with interpreters acting disrespectfully towards queer clients or not interpreting correctly. However, some interpreters were described as helpful, and they have contributed to programming on working with queer clients. Multiple interviewees acknowledged that both non-discrimination and confidentiality are included in the code of ethics that all interpreters sign, though they have heard of or witnessed breaches of both. One interviewee noted that when such a breach occurs, organizations infrequently respond. Most professionals choose not to use that same interpreter, but do not file a formal complaint that would trigger any accountability measures.  There is also little guidance for interpreters that work with queer clients. One interviewee described how, when interpreting, she proactively reassures clients of her role and that she will  83 maintain confidentiality. However, this was described as something she had taken upon herself based on her professional experience rather than something she had been instructed to do. Contracted services offer neither accountability nor support on an institutional level, making interactions with clients highly subject to the knowledge and attitudes of individual contractors. Additionally, having the same provider interact with clients rather than switching providers for every appointment was described as important for relationship building. Requests for a specific interpreter can be made for pre-planned appointments, but in the current contracted system, it is nearly impossible to arrange to have the same interpreter when using the phone. 4E: Putting Power Back into Affected Communities Some of the most successful stories shared of changes in service provision and policy advocacy focused on involving queer refugees and asylum seekers in programming and policy development and making resources available to them. Including queer refugees and asylum seekers in trainings was described as a way to both enhance the understanding of service providers and to support development and capacity building for refugees and asylum seekers. Employing queer refugees and asylum seekers was considered by multiple interviewees to be the best strategy to incorporate their knowledge and networks into a service. It was important to these interviewees that people with lived experience also be compensated fairly for their labour. Putting queer refugees and asylum seekers in a position of expertise was also described as the best way policymakers could improve policy design and implementation. One example of this cited was the Canberra Statement created by the Forcibly Displaced Persons Network and  84 advocates for several policy recommendations following a conference that focused on queer displacement (Dixon, 2019). Support groups run by queer refugees and asylum seekers were one of the few structures that were reported to provide consistent and comprehensive support for both social, mental heal, and service needs. The nature of these support groups allows them to be flexible to members' needs. In some cases, members were described as going with each other to appointments or community events to provide support. Confidentiality was identified as critical for members to participate. In some cases, this meant not taking photos, giving the option to use pseudonyms, and not posting meeting locations.  Support groups were also one of the definitive ways that any interviewee described as helping to heal from the impacts of trauma. One interviewee highlighted the ability to connect with people who had gone through something similar and a deep sense of commitment and solidarity within groups to their healing impact, as well as the groups' ability to create spaces of empowerment. She describes how clients may come to support groups and initially be very shy, share mostly bad experiences, or have no hopes for the future. However, over time, they often start to discuss positive aspects of their life and feel comfortable mingling and speaking with other participants.  Additionally, members of peer-led support groups in multiple states have contributed to trainings for service providers. This education and outreach were also described in the broader community. One interviewee noted that some support group members have reestablished  85 connections with their cultural communities and have found acceptance and been able to educate their community members on their own experience and identity:  When they join the group, they see things in a bigger image. And they, a lot of them, they can they get jobs because of this group. They get educated because of the group. They have been empowered because of this group. They have other connections back to their communities: the Iranian communities, the Muslim LGBTQI platform, the African community. They went back to their communities because of this group. Some of them, they are in Catholic and Christianity kind of beliefs, they're in this group, they educate back to their churches. (Marie Chrystal, 2022) Another interviewee noted that while support groups have been helpful for their clients, there is a need for more funding and support to make them sustainable. Given the findings that support groups play a major role in both meeting service needs and developing a space for advocacy within services and policy, peer-led support groups appear to be a key area of investment to create spaces of safety and dignity for Queer refugees and asylum seekers.     86   Chapter 5: Conclusion Summary Section one of Chapter 4 explored how gender and sexuality are positioned as disconnected from general migration policies. Likewise, it noted several examples of where nominal inclusions for the protection of people of diverse gender and sexuality are stated, but where the conditions around them reinforce binary, cis-heteronormativity, and the patriarchy, including connections to international law. When gender or sexuality is explicitly mentioned in policy, it is often juxtaposed with traumatic or invasive processes and the mention of individual service providers. This association showcases the ways that state power is enacted by service providers on the bodies of queer refugees and asylum seekers. Parallels of gender and sexuality being ignored in practice were also identified, starting with a lack of data. Binary, cis-heteronormative assumptions were also described in the few sectors that engage with gender, such as family violence services.  In cases where clients frequently share their gender or sexuality with service providers, when the providers proactively raise the issues, many may self-identify as queer. Mental health resources also appeared to facilitate more open discussion on gender and sexuality compared to other sectors. All interviewees advocated for greater attention be paid to queer refugees and asylum seekers, and many called for policy makers to explicitly name them and to involve them  87 in policy-making. In the absence of structural inclusions, much of the advocacy and service referrals that do include queer people appear to occur in informal spaces, such as support groups. Practices that were described as more successful at meeting queer refugees’ needs included those that fostered a breakdown between service institutions and community to home settings, including support groups, home visits, and word-of-mouth referrals. Some difference also arose in how being a refugee versus an asylum seeker impacts the way people access queer inclusive services.  In section two of Chapter 4, several sources of risk in policy and practice arose. Complex trauma and consequential mental health challenges were one of these risks, both as a result of migration policies, such as detention, but also as factors that limit the ability to use services. A lack of trust with official institutions is one example stemming from past experiences of trauma within parallel institutions. Unhealthy or dangerous coping mechanisms were also a concern, particularly since many of the safeguards, such as community support, may be unavailable to queer refugees and asylum seekers. Additionally, a lack of access to basic services was identified, often relating to financial instability imposed by visa conditions, but also due to discrimination inside services. Legal support, education, and housing were brought up as particularly inaccessible. Although healthcare was described as having improved in the past few years, availability of gender-affirming care was still noted as a challenge. Across services, bureaucratic processes also posed difficulties, such as paperwork requirements and language barriers, which are particularly exclusionary to people from non-Western backgrounds.  88 Other risks included abuse from family, employers, and individuals that may take advantage of queer refugee and asylum seekers. Surveillance and suspicion by the state were also identified. In the policy review, as surveillance was frequently discussed, often relating to visa conditions, which can have significant consequences, including visa refusal or cancellation. Criminalization was another flagged risk, particularly due to a lack of support socially and in services and potential risky coping mechanisms, such as unreported employment or drug use. Criminalization was associated with migration through unauthorized channels and met with punitive measures. However, much of the discussion of criminalization involved the general criminal justice system, indicating a continued link between it and migration management. In section three of Chapter 4, several methods of safety creation are identified. One of the most important was trauma-informed communication. Interviewees described several situations in which a lack of trauma-informed communication had been harmful, and there was once again a link between mental health services, which involves training on trauma, and the ability to create safe spaces. Establishing personal connections between providers and clients was also highlighted, particularly having providers who share either elements of queerness or a client’s cultural background. Deconstructing power dynamics was discussed frequently, from affirming that clients can make choices instead of just listening to providers to involvement of queer refugees and asylum seekers in program and policy development. Continual learning was another recommendation, both in understanding clients’ backgrounds but also developing attitudes of reflection and openness.   89 Section four of Chapter 4 described numerous overarching paradigms that must change in order to facilitate more peaceful outcomes for queer refugees. Widespread training on working with queer refugees and asylum seekers was called for, both by those who had experienced training and by those who felt they needed further training. Addressing violence in policy was another key recommendation, including eliminating temporary humanitarian visas, boat turnbacks, indefinite detention, and limited access to work or services. Much of this violence was identified as anchored in the framing of migrants as criminals or untrustworthy and giving individuals in the migration system significant power over them with little recourse.  Redistribution of time was another key element identified. Time is shown to be weaponized against people in detention or waiting for their visa applications to be decided. Many interviewees described the importance of spending time with clients to build trust and connection, yet several also described significant time pressures placed on their role that meant prioritizing relationship building or taking time to ensure clients understand their choices, was difficult, unless it was required. Concerns raised by interviewees also pointed to the limitations of contracted services, which offer little accountability or standardization to ensure providers are interacting appropriately with queer clients.  Lastly, putting power back into affected communities was a major concern of the interviewees. How this was advocated for included hiring people with lived experience in institutions, bringing people with lived experience into policy and program design, and supporting peer-led support groups. Such support groups were shown to be particularly helpful  90 in both addressing immediate mental health and service needs and also creating vehicles for advocacy and education to service providers and communities. Concluding Thoughts Several conclusions can be drawn from these findings. First, many of them support previous literature on service provision and asylum processes, particularly on the role of Western and cis-heteronormativity in migration policy and processes. The discursive analysis yields a continuation of historical notions of sexual citizenship, in which heteronormative, gender-conforming nuclear families are the main unit recognized, and men are assumed to occupy the top position in the family and government hierarchies. Likewise, strong discourses of criminality arise. National migration policy presents a punitive framework that emphasizes productivity and upholds a white-privileging population management scheme. Punishment arises in response to challenges to the border authority and to the management and control of the Australian population.  The findings also reflect prior research that points to gaps in service provision. The parallel gaps between exclusion in policy and in service delivery highlight the interconnectedness of structural and cultural violence, with cultural violence manifesting in a lack of understanding and prejudice in interpersonal interactions. The analysis reflects a need for greater focus on intersecting identities within service provisions and in policy. Specifically, institutions need to commit funding, time, and human resources to implementing trauma-informed practices throughout services, rather than only in mental health spaces. Training and educational  91 practices to develop an understanding of allyship with queer refugees and asylum seekers are also critical.  What is most interesting about this project’s findings are the ways that service providers and communities create spaces of safety and how these are connected to structural change. While Ambrosini and Van der Leun (2015) find a lack of attention to structural change in migration services, multiple interviewees in this research demonstrate that it is possible to connect structural change to everyday practice and believe doing so is necessary to fully meet the needs of their clients. As in the work of Lee and Brotman, which calls for anti-oppressive practices, advocacy, and structural thinking in services working with queer asylum seekers (Lee & Brotman, 2013), this data highlighted the need for service providers to engage in advocacy and to proactively create spaces of safety. In successful cases, these practices centered around placing queer refugees and asylum seekers in positions of power. Support groups led by those with lived experience are elevated as a prime example of personal healing, resource and knowledge distribution, and advocacy. However, providers also described that the processes of reflection and deconstructing hierarchies between them and their clients, even in one-on-one interactions, help to overcome everyday challenges.  Ultimately, the significance of these interpersonal moments is reflected in the ways that they pave the way for advocacy, not just on behalf of queer refugees and asylum seekers, but in partnership and solidarity. Given the need for attention to safety, trust, and relationship-building identified by interviewees, these findings do not just point to the necessity of both personal and systematic healing. They demonstrate that the two require each other. Just as a  92 structural lens is needed to deconstruct systems that produce axiomatic violence on an individual level, everyday moments of reconstructing safety, agency, and relationships of solidarity create space to push for those same elements on a structural and cultural level. This kind of process should not be equated to passive politeness; interviewees described intentional and sometimes tedious or confrontational moments of advocacy, as well as personal reflection and commitment to the people with whom they work. The findings call for bold approaches to releasing power and authority over clients and instead to enter into partnership as part of rethinking larger questions about the authority and purpose embedded in the migration system. Furthermore, many of the practices for creating inclusion highlighted in this project involve a blurring the lines between service provision and community development. As power moves towards communities with lived experiences, the role of the service provider as a professional and, sometimes, as a conduit for the authority of the state, also shifts. Ultimately, bringing practices of safety and inclusion into institutional structures calls for a radical un-bordering of the notions of the state, of who has the right to a sense of belonging and movement, of the barriers between institutions and communities, and of the disparate power and relationship dynamics between service providers and people with lived experience.  Additionally, contracted services, which prioritize profitability and maintain distance between providers and people with lived experience are incompatible with the methods of safety creation described in this research. This thesis does not explore alternative resettlement models, but it does identify important components that should be considered in rethinking migration policy regardless of the exact model. First, it should be done in consultation with  93 people with lived experience. Second, it should also incorporate sensitivity to intersectionality, particularly with gender and sexual orientation, but also with other identities, such as disability, religion, etc. Third, it needs to prioritize training on trauma-informed care and cultural knowledge that takes gender and sexuality into account.  Limitations This research included interviews with service providers because of the constrictions of obtaining ethical clearance. No application for ethics clearance was lodged to interview people of refugee and asylum seeker backgrounds based on the advice that the Human Ethics Committee was unlikely to approve the project if interviews were done with people from refugee backgrounds.  However, this means that the only people who were of refugee and asylum seeker background interviewed here were also service providers, and they were asked about the general experiences of their clients, not their own. Queer refugees and asylum seekers were consulted in this project; however, this was largely done through informal relationship building and casual conversations, and their direct stories and concerns were used to guide interpretation. Consequently, this thesis leaves their stories of lived experience in the informal realm, and these individuals were unable to be compensated by Western Sydney University as interviewees, which the researcher identifies as oppositional to ethical research. The perspective of service providers as intermediaries between policy and people with lived experience is important for understanding the systems that they are a part of, but is not a substitute for the perspectives of people with lived experience.  94 Recommendations and future research directions Several questions for further research arise out of this project. The first deals with how service providers can break down the distance between them and their queer refugee and asylum seeker clients while navigating the realities of their professional expectations. Professional boundaries are a cornerstone of service provision. Even in mental health spaces, professionals are excepted not to disclose aspects of their life to the same degree as their clients. Finding this balance and reimagining what boundaries are necessary will be critical to navigating anti-oppressive relationships. Moreover, institutional change is often slow and can bring risks to those who advocate for it. Exploring ways that service providers can engage in advocacy around their own roles will also be necessary, as well as the relationship between service providers and outside activist groups. Second, discourses of suspicion and criminality were strongly identified in this project. However, there was little data on the actual role and repercussions of surveillance. Recent research points to data from social media being collected and used to determine whether queer asylum seekers’ and refugees’ claims are genuine (Rikke Andreassen, 2021). However, further research is needed to identify the full extent to which surveillance is used on queer refugees and asylum seekers and how that data is applied. Third, alternatives to contracted services should be considered. Other models of service provision are gaining popularity, particularly community-based resettlement programs, which involve regular people from the community taking an active role in supporting refugees or asylum seekers. This model has been adopted in other contexts with reported positive  95 outcomes (Gregory Maniatis & Jennifer Bond, 2018). Ministers from six countries—Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Argentina, Spain and New Zealand—committed to using community-based models in 2018 (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, 2018). In 2022, an Australian pilot community sponsorship program was launched, Community Refugee Integration and Settlement Pilot (CRISP) (Community Refugee Sponsorship Australia, 2021).  Given that queer refugees often have complex relationships with various communities, it is vital that greater attention be paid to their identity-specific needs. A community-based resettlement program would also need to consider prejudice within the program and provide guidance on meeting the needs of queer people and others who are from marginalized identities. However, existing organizations that use community sponsorship have made efforts to find sponsors who are specifically welcoming to queer refugees (The Center Action Network, n.d.), indicating that it is possible to incorporate intersectional experiences into alternative models.   96 References Achiume, E.

Thank you for considering being a participant in a University research project. The researchers are asking that you agree to supply your information (data) for use in this project and to also agree to allow the data to potentially be used in future research projects. This request is in line with current University and government policy that encourages the re-use of data once it has been collected. Collecting information for research can be an inconvenience or burden for participants and has significant costs associated with it. Sharing your data with other researchers gives potential for others to reflect on the data and its findings, to re-use it with new insight, and increase understanding in this research area. You have been asked to agree to Extended consent.  Extended consent When you agree to extended consent it means that you agree that your data, as part of a larger dataset (the information collected for this project) can be re-used in projects that are  • an extension of this project  • closely related to this project • in the same general area of this research. The researchers will allow this data to be used by other academic researchers who meet their institution qualifications to conduct research. To enable this re-use, your data will be held at the University in its data repository and managed under a Data Management Plan. The stored data available for re-use will not have information in it that makes you identifiable. The re-use of the data will only be allowed after an ethics committee has agreed that the new use of the data meets the requirements of ethics review. The researchers want to keep the data indefinitely for possible re-use.  You are welcome to discuss these issues further with the researchers before deciding if you agree. You can also find more information about the re-use of data in research in the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research – see Sections 2.2.14 - 2.2.18.  https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/national-statement-ethical-conduct-human-research-2007-updated-2018  Appendix 4: Explanation of Extended Consent     121 Demographic Information  Project: Policy to Practice: What Australian Migration Policy Means for LGBTQ Refugees  Instructions:  Please fill out the following demographics as they pertain to you. This information will be kept confidential and will only be available to the research team.  Why am I being asked to provide this information?  No information that could identify you will be attributed to you in the dissemination of the research findings. Understanding your demographics simply allows the research team to document if participants of similar demographics tend to respond to questions in similar ways, and if so, understand the importance of personal identity in the responses. If relevant, this information will only be discussed as part of a larger trend, not for individual participants.

    "abstract": "This Master of Research thesis explores the bridge between policy and practice that impacts queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia, intersections that are not well addressed in existing migration policy or research. It builds on a growing area of research around the needs of queer refugees and asylum seekers, who are marginalized within policy and settlement services globally. It adopts a methodological lens informed by queer theory, peace theory, and intersectionality to explore mechanisms of power and resistance, queerness and displacement in Australia. Data collection tools include discourse analysis, policy review and interviews with service providers working with queer refugees or asylum seekers to identify ways these discourses or power and resistance are materialized in practice. The thesis argues that the cis-heteronormative assumptions underpinning global migration systems create contexts of marginalization and axiomatic violence for queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia. Exclusions and the punitive conditions imposed on queer refugees and asylum seekers create vulnerability to exploitation and criminalization. The thesis finds a need for: an intersectional approach to resettlement in refugee and asylum seeker policy; greater emphasis on training on inclusive practice and trauma-informed communication; re-negotiating power relationships between providers and clients; the inclusion of queer people with lived experience in policy-making; greater investment in peer-led community groups; and a departure from contracted service models. There is a need for service providers to participate in shaping more peaceful and improved outcomes for queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia. The thesis findings align with existing research, primarily from North America, that identifies the exclusion of queer refugees and asylum seekers from support systems. The thesis contends that practicing healing and safety creation in everyday interpersonal interactions, and working for structural change, will complement each other to deliver improved outcomes for queer refugees and asylum seekers in Australia",
