The queer community is in a mental health crisis, with substance abuse, high suicide rates, anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and complex post-traumatic stress disorders being pervasive in the community. Current therapeutic services and medical services often enact more harm than good and that mutual aid and chosen family has been a cornerstone to support chronic illnesses. To better understand these complexities, a community arts project was held to explore how it might support these theories. This research was facilitated at a local queer owned Boston fiber shop. Groups were held for queer fiber artist in the Boston area of all ages and identities to explore a positive sense of self, safety, and belonging in the queer community. People from a range of neighborhoods came to experience togetherness and work on their current knitting, crochet, embroidery, felting projects. This research demonstrated the way joy and connection is created within in groups. As well as the importance of safe spaces for people to explore identity and creativity.    Keywords: Expressive Art Therapy, Community Care, Queer Intimacy, Queer Community, Disability Justice, Anti-Capitalism, Fiber Art Circles, Emotional Regulation, Co-Regulation.   Author Identity Statement: The researcher for this thesis is a 30-year-old white, queer and non-binary trans person. They use they/them pronouns. They grew up upper-middle class in a predominantly white suburban New England area with little queer representation.      3   Fiber Art Circles, Belonging, and Mental Health in the Queer Community: A Community Arts Based Project Introduction The LBGTQIA+ community is the most vulnerable in current culture and society, as “45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. Additionally, nearly one in five transgender and nonbinary youth attempted suicide” (Trevor Project, 2022). These statistics show a concerning combination of pervasive and rising numbers, indicating the overwhelming presence of mental health issues that range from anxiety disorders, depression, PTSD, personality disorders, substance abuse disorders, high rates of suicidality and chronic senses of hopelessness. Within the psychological research field, a mass majority of the findings revolve around the commonality of these disorders, however they rarely give credit to the reality of this issue. As Gill- Peterson (2022) puts it “transphobia [and homophobia] is serving as a way to intensify a regime of policing that is primarily formed out of racism.” On top of that it also includes, classism, homophobia, internalized homophobia, violence, bias, inequality, and so on that largely contributes to these mental health disorders. There is inherent gaslighting and gate keeping within the medical field when it comes to trans people especially, “If any single newspaper of record or magazine had to answer why psychiatric evaluation is part of trans health care, for the exact same procedures that non trans people can get all the time without psychiatric evaluation -- I mean, people would be shook. Because the whole edifice, the whole house of cards completely crumbles at that point, there is no reason other than hate, hatred, and animus, and bias against this population to sic a bunch of psychiatrists on them.” (Gill-Peterson 2022). It is these types of honest confrontations with the ludicrous history of mental health treatment on LGBTQ that sparked my thesis project, because these are the gaps that are missing in 4  psychological research. The mental health field needs to be able to take accountability of their violence and neglect towards queer people in order to move towards healthier treatment.  The DSM does not include insight on the impact of anti-queer violence on mental health. While the DSM has made some progress such as removing being gay as a disorder, it still in fact does include disorders around “cross dressing” and gender dysphoria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This is indicative of a much larger issue: the stigma within the mental and physical health care system around the LGBTQ+ community. It is widely reported in texts such as in Czyselska (2021) Queering Psychotherapy that therapists and doctors have often done more harm than good to its queer client, resulting in further ostracization. Due to this consistent dynamic, many queer people do not trust the health industry and turn to community support instead (Levin et al., 2020). This of course has its pros and cons. While there is a lot of unique beauty within how the community supports each other, this support can only go so far. Gender affirming surgeries, medications, and professional psychiatric trauma informed care is also essential. In the literature review, I explored what the current research has found concerning mental health within the queer community right now, and what the gaps are in the findings. The research shows almost a standstill in how to shift the mental health crisis, because so much of the issue is the lack of authentic understanding and direct action that is needed to heal the present wounds. Most of the mental health crisis is due to deeply rooted societal biases and abuse and neglect that form due to these negative ideologies around being LGBTQIA+.  LGBTQIA+ disorders and issues are often looked at case by case, as isolated problems rather than as a collective issue within society. Therapists and inpatient facilities often attribute anxiety to a general disorder, not to the way in which one may have consistently experienced torment, rejection, and sense of unsafety in their life which creates an activated nervous system 5  consistently on survival mode.  This thesis’s research turns to queer rights, disability justice activists and BIPOC queer advocates to better understand how the role of community, mutual aid, chosen family and healing can occur.  The other main objective in this literature review is understanding how creating secure attachments can heal the wounds from growing up in a negligent, violent society.  One underrepresented field changing standards in health care and capitalism is disability justice (DJ). DJ advocates have been critical in this time of late-stage capitalism. People with disabilities often experience rejection in society for being “unsuccessful” participates in capitalism, as opposed to non-disabled, neurotypical people. Eiler and D’Angelo express “the nature of disability oppression within capitalism…under capitalism human bodies are expected to “function like machines” to produce the maximum amount of profit possible” (2020). Queer people often fall under this umbrella of not being “functional enough” for capitalism.   Expressive art therapy is another field that is positively impacting the queer community, though far less accessible than DJ workers.  Expressive art therapy (EXAT) has the benefit of being a more fluid practice than most talk therapy. EXAT allows more room for experimental treatment methods and is less about diagnosis and formulaic practices. It is also a far less invasive form of trauma therapy, allowing clients to touch their wounds through creative practices. The research within this thesis focused on giving queer people a space to explore their creative medium within fiber arts. The groups created for this thesis like all EXAT gives participants a sense of safety in their craft. It can be challenging to talk about the impact and trauma behind growing up queer in a violent world, or to even talk to strangers at all, this research gave participants the physicality of their fiber craft to help them regulate emotions, sooth any anxiety and have a place to focus. Fiber art was chosen as the medium to explore this 6  research topic because of its rich history and the role it is played in community building and sustainability. For example, knitting circles have existed for decades to support women’s mental health and other forms of fiber art such as tapestry, embroidery, weaving have a much longer historical context of community. Queer fiber arts are a more recent practice in the sense of being explicitly gender and sexuality explorative however queer people have always existed in these circles.  Literature Review LGBTQIA+ Mental Health In the recent body of research in the LGBTQIA+ community, there is an overwhelming rate of mental illness. As quoted in Levin et al. (2020) research on queer chosen family, “I don’t think I know a single queer person that is not chronically ill in some way.” (p. 13). In a recent collection of findings reported by The Trevor Project, “28% of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability at some point in their lives… 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth” (2022). This body of research expresses statements about the high suicide rates, suicidal ideation, self-harm, depression, anxiety, abuse, PTSD, substance use disorders and so on. that exist within the LGBTQIA+ community. The prevalence is very clear. For example, according to Iacono (2018) “One study in the United States found that nearly one third of SGMY (sexual and gender minority youth) met the criteria for a mental disorder and/or reported a suicide attempt in their lifetime”. Rojas et al. (2019) reported on Grant et al. (2011) research stating that “95% of LGBTQ+ patients in a specialized substance abuse program had at least one personality disorder” This was based on a study of 145 adult men and women that were part of the PRIDE institute in Minnesota substance abuse rehab program. Other researcher like Scheer et al. (2019) and Hardy & Monypenny, (2019) express the disproportion of trauma and 7  “alarmingly high rates of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempts, self-harm behavior” rates in the queer community (p. 4).  Lastly Symanski & Balsam, (2011) write that “Insidious trauma’ refers to the ongoing negative experiences associated with living as a member of an oppressed group…who experience disparities in mental health disorders relative to their heterosexual peers” (p. 5).  While the research provides vital and informative information on the prevalence and pervasiveness of mental health issues in this community, the general body of knowledge within the mental health field to date is missing the heart of the issue, which is the inquiry of what is happening in the lived experience of patients receiving healthcare and what legitimate mental health needs and treatment for individuals is. In Ayhan et al. (2020) research looking at the discrimination of queer clients in health care it is found that, “the attitudes of health care professionals are one of the primary problems that SGM individuals experience in health services when considering the behaviorally based nature of discrimination… Health care service administrators must increase health care providers’ awareness about negative attitudes toward SGM individuals and avoid negative behaviors. The providers must receive training to increase their knowledge about SGM individuals” (p. 58). Additionally, transgender scholar and historian, Jullian Gill-Peterson speaks on this topic in her Death Panel podcast episode to debunk the transphobic medical debates on whether or not to support transgender people’s healthcare decisions. She describes the lack of empathy and accessibility to transgender services, which essentially gaslights trans youth especially and disregards their identity as legitimate. She goes into that much of the USA population view trans use as wanting to transition because it's popular, or trendy, she goes on to express “it's literally illegal for young people to transition in Alabama, and there are policies ripping trans kids out of their families, putting them in foster 8  care, there is more scrutiny on trans young people than ever, they are more likely to be harassed, targeted and bullied every single place they go, what exactly would be so exciting about that” (Gill- Peterson, 2022). While these two pieces of evidence support the argument that health care discrimination and bias is perpetuating the mental illnesses of queer people, there is a very limited amount of information on this topic, and a lack of accountability from the mental health care system to understand their role in this issue.  In regard to those who do not have access or trust in medical care, chosen family has been supporting mental health needs Levin et al. (2020) research illustrates how little research there is backing this understanding up she states, “for contemporary social work, health care and other human service professions, the domain of knowledge surrounding queer chosen family and care giving in terms of health and illness is lacking and requires further investigation.” (p. 3) There are many anecdotal examples from queer and trans people about their issues and experiences with the medical and mental health field, and rarely are those expressed in psychological research.  Theory and Approaches to Aid Queer Community Minority Stress Theory In Hatchel et.al research on transgender minority stress (2018), Myer’s (2003) minority stress model is introduced as a theory that backs up the question of why the LGBTQIA+ community has such consistency in mental illness cases. Though there has not been a great deal of successful research that explains the minority stress theory, because gathering large sample is costly and more intensive (Hatchelet al., 2018). What has been found in the smaller samples is that “most transgender students have experienced some form of victimization at school… 90% 9  heard negative remarks about their gender expression and more than half reported being physically harassed” (p. 2468). This type of childhood trauma ensues psychological distress such as anxiety, depression, isolation, suicidality, self-harm, and attachment wounds on those that experience it in their day to day lives. These factors affect a child’s sense of belonging and “belonging can buffer the impact of adverse events like exposure to aggression and peer victimization” (p. 2468) This research also points out that transgender youth of color especially, lack secure safe connections with adults, teachers, peers to help rebuild those secure attachments that are being threatened by peer victimization. Which is where the role of chosen family and community must step in.  Minority Stress, Community, and Connection There is a large body of research supporting the power of community. According to Williams et al (2018) research on arts-based groups to aid chronic mental health issues, “CMHC (chronic mental health conditions) frequently experience social isolation and marginalization…One approach to developing meaningful social connections is through engagement in the arts, such as music, creative writing, drama, and visual art. The growing practice of doctors referring patients to community Arts‐Based Groups (ABGs) for social support is known as “the arts on prescription” (p. 15). Rogers and colleagues’ (2021) research on minority stress related to suicidal ideation amongst queer adults, reported that “connectedness to the LBGT community may serve as a buffer against negative psychological outcomes… greater internalized homophobia is associated with fewer connections with other sexual minority individuals” (p. 39). Internalized homophobia is one of the leaders in depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation for queer adults, and leads to “self-blame, self-hatred, and shame… these negative emotions [serve] as a major risk factor for suicide (p. 39). Of course, the support of 10  other queer people alone is not enough to eradicate symptoms, however authentic intimate connections such as “chosen family” is often a life changing social support that can help heal attachment wounds. In Levin et al. (2020) anthropological research around chosen families in queer and trans young adults sheds light on the powerful effects of community. This research argues a critical piece that isn’t found in much psychological research, “access to appropriate and affirmative medical care is empirically challenging for the population…to explore the notions of care giving amongst queer/trans individuals that supersedes formal medical contexts…we aim to better understand the expansive notion of care giving and receiving amongst queer trans individuals and their chosen family members” (p. 3). This is such critical work to examine because it is no secret to the queer community how dismissive and abusive the medical world can be. Trans and queer people express frustration not only from medical trauma, but from behavioral health professionals as well; putting the responsibility of care onto the shoulders of chosen family to act as providers.  Eiler and D’Angelo’s (2020) research on the tense relationship between social work and anti-capitalism disability activism contributes powerful, radical arguments to this conversation When talking about the queer mental health crisis, it’s impossible to not talk about the need for disability justice. Under capitalism, “human bodies are expected to function like machines to produce the maximum amount of profit possible. The body’s failure to do so is constructed as disability” (p. 359). With so many queer people experiencing homelessness, displacement, family rejection, mental illnesses, there is a huge population within the queer community that cannot function under capitalism in this way. These bodies that cannot function as a “machine” are seen as lesser and are even more vulnerable to both scrutiny and exacerbated mental health symptoms because systems have failed to support them (Eiler & D’Angelo, 2020).  11   One important text in disability justice, Care Work (2018), Eiler and D’Angelo reference throughout their research. This text is critical because it is written by Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha (a highly regarded and queer disabled person of color) and discusses the role of community in caretaking, the reality of suicide within the queer community and the lack of people she knows that are immune to it, even the most successful queer people. Other important queer anecdotes come from Thom’s text I Hope We Choose Love (2019). She writes about how the trans community is not moving forward in the ways it may seem. While white cis passing trans people who are highly successful are becoming more accepted, however the trans people who are deeper in the margins are still disregarded, disrespected and murdered without people blinking an eye.  The Need for Attachment  In Bell Hooks text, All About Love (2001). Bell Hooks expresses, “only love can heal the wounds of the past. However, the intensity of our woundedness often leads to a closing of the heart, making it impossible for us to give or receive the love that is given to us. We must dare to acknowledge how little we know of love in both theory and practice…we yearn to end the lovelessness that is so pervasive in our society” (p. 6). All About Love is a foundational text for understanding how poorly we understand the concept of how to love within this world and how imperative it is that we learn how to love, build community, and experience intimacy. Texts such as these are a critical component to this thesis research because to heal the deep attachment wounds brought on by this broken-hearted world, we have to understand how important and how healing love and community can be (and really is) in effecting this change.  Connection and Biology  12  According to Dana (2020) “Connection is a biological imperative, vital to our survival…we are wired for connection” (p. 35) This need is threatened when you grow up as part of a marginalized group. One of the major reasons why so many queer people suffer from mental illness is because our secure attachment is threatened and confiscated by growing up in a homophobic world. This is a world that has demonstrated violence, hatred, and fear towards the LGBTQIA population. Humans are hardwired for community and a desire for love, respect, and a sense of belonging. Often, queer people grow up questioning their sense of self-worth because of society’s rejection of them (Bridge et al., (2019). It’s understood through attachment theory that early childhood and adolescent traumas around connection have the power to weaken one’s ability for developing high self-esteem, healthy relationships, and a sense of self-worth. This continues to deeply impact their mental health throughout adulthood. Learning to build connection and heal those wounds is critical (Levine & Heller, 2019). Based on the literature, there is a clear need for an understanding of attachment and the psychobiological implications, and yet, it is being revealed in the body of knowledge of the many queer people who experience insecure attachments throughout their life because of the minority stress theory. This raises the issue of why attachment theory is not invited into this conversation more. During the current investigation there was no mention of attachment theory or the need for attachment within the psychological research on queer mental health issues.  Intersection of Disability Justice, Antiracism, and Queer Advocacy  In the text Queering Psychotherapy, Czyzselka references Crawford et al. (2018) on how people of both sexual and ethnic minority groups often report having lasting, negative experiences from therapy. “QTIPOC individuals in therapy [say] it can be as much of a lottery to find therapist who are able to work with embodied radicalized trauma given its neglect in 13  training institutions.” (p. xvi). If minority groups can’t even find a secure attachment within a professional therapeutic context, how are we expected to heal?  The narrative within attachment theory as explained through Levine & Heller (2010) is that all people have an attachment style: essentially a set of rules we have learned and developed from growing up, including anxious, avoidant, insecure, disorganized, and secure. Your style explains your approach to connection and intimacy. If you grow up experiencing a lot of insecure attachments, from things such as bullying, parental rejection, social isolation, your ability to have secure, healthy connections will likely be hindered, “attachment principles teach us that most people are only as needy as their unmet needs” (p. 21). I believe this helps to explain the high rate of personality disorders in queer people. Personality disorders such as BPD (borderline personality disorder) are rooted in trauma and insecure attachments in early childhood. One of the major challenges for people with BPD is their issues with attachment. They are extremely anxious and avoidant, making it often challenging or impossible to have secure longstanding connections. In one study on co-occurring disorders in LBGTQIA+ people, 95% of patients had at least one personality disorder alongside their substance abuse within the treatment facility (Rojas et al., 2019). If the desire is to shift the rates of mental illness in queer people, the field needs to start at the root of the problem, their sense and experience of belonging.  Queering Psychotherapy by Czyzselka is one of the first in the field to be written by queer BIPOC therapists for therapists to support queer clients because of this mental health crisis that isn’t being attended to at its roots. Lewis (2021) in her essay on being a queer black therapist discusses the value of care, that it’s “the need to not only practice care but to understand that self and collective care is a powerful politics. The practice of self-care as a rejection or refusal of the very alienation that comes from racial capitalism” (p. 15). She then goes on to explain the 14  mentality that queer and BIPOC mental health issues need to be addressed, “we are not trying to fix the people we work with in a way that makes them more so called normal, whether that is white normal, hetero normal, gender normal, ability normal. We are trying to say, this is a reality the world out there with its toxicities…and what were trying to do here is make you feel legitimate and relatively whole. Authentic. We are trying to help you manage. Not to make you “normal” (p. 15). This is an incredibly important distinction that Lewis is making. Attending to queer mental health disparities are about allowing clients to honor what is happening on a societal level without undermining it as a diagnosis alone.  Fiber Arts and Expressive Art Therapy     There is a long history of fiber art circles, whether it be sewing, knitting, weaving, embroidery, tapestry etc. Women have been coming together to create fabrics, make clothes, create community for centuries. This relationship between craft and community was researched by Sinner and Yazdnapanah (2021). For groups like Fibers and Beyond who have been crafting as a collective for 25 years, the relationship between creating, fiber and each other is essential to their wellbeing. It is described that their work is created to “document their worlds in terms of events, scenes and daily activities, with motifs of togetherness and pleasure dominating over expressions of hardship” (p. 72). For these women they express that “the heart of fiber arts are sensory responses to textures and contours of touching feeling seeing and energizing in ways that other art practices do not necessarily facilitate” (p. 72). To place fiber arts into that context there are so many parallels that can be drawn to expressive art therapy. The exploration of senses, play and pleasure that comes with fiber arts is so much of what expressive art therapy is about as a concept. In Halprin’s (2003) text on expressive art therapy she states “Through multimodal art mediums, we are able to bring forward the material of our lives, reveal what has been hidden, 15  and express old stories in new ways. The passion and creativity of the arts allow us to live with our suffering and find release through creative play” (p. 21). Fiber arts, like all other art mediums become an outlet to share a story, and intentionally or not allows us to heal from what we have lived by sharing that story.  Fiber Arts Supporting Mental Health      There is research evidence that supports the understanding that fiber crafts are good for wellbeing. In Fontichiaro’s (2018) reports on the therapeutic benefits of knitting and crocheting, she states there have been six therapeutic themes that came out of prior research by Perruzza and Kinsealla (2010), “enhanced perceived control, building a sense of self, expression, transforming the illness experience, gaining a sense of purpose, and building social support. (p.246).” These traits are essential for mental health, to build self-esteem, gain a stronger sense of self and be able to have a sense of achievement or accomplishment when everything else may feel out of control deeply can benefit a client struggling with mental health issues. Another study by Burns and Van Der Meer (2020) reports that “there is evidence that knitting helps alleviate depression and reduced anxiety” (p. 2). These findings specifically looked at women with anorexia nervosa who used knitting as a coping technique within an eating disorder unit. The findings report that “74% of participants reported increased relaxation and comfort and the benefit of distraction and distancing from eating disorder thoughts and feelings” (p. 2).  Other findings in this research show that crochet and knitting supports mindfulness, develop concentration and focus and allow for a space for relaxation and accomplishment (Burns & Van Der Meer, 2020).  Intersectional Queer Conversations in Fiber Arts  While fiber art groups aren’t historically illustrated as queer spaces, current day knitting communities are full of queer people. Not only are queer fiber artists coming to the front, but 16  BIPOC queer fiber artists are vocalizing their lack of representation as well. As Brandi Cheyenne Harper shares in her book Knitting for Radical Self Care (2021) “Angela Davis says, ‘Radical simply means grasping things at the root’…I am a Black woman. A black knitter. A black queer…This book pays homage to my revolutionary ancestors” (p. 10) Cheyenne Harper goes on to explore the lack of critical thinking amongst creative circles. The lack of access to tools, time, supports, that exist within the queer BIPOC fiber community, and the need to revolutionize the fiber art community to be more intersectional and accessible. The need for representation in the fiber world is being talked about within the art therapy world as well. In Lauren Leone’s Craft in Art Therapy (2021) Holmes writes an essay on using crochet to “unpack toxic radical stress” and cope with racism in academia. She expresses, “part of the black experience in academia is walking the line between hypervisibility and invisibility…being genuinely myself while maintaining my ability to exist safely within a predominantly white space does not always coincide” (p. 91).  Holmes shares that she used crocheting as a coping mechanism to survive the racism she experienced.  Queer Threads (2017), a collection of queer fiber artists depicts “the politics of craft” through a variety of fiber art and interviews. It is narrative surrounds the concept that “every day, everywhere queer quilting bees and knitting circles are acts of activism by just existing” (Chaich, 2017 p. 2).  Queer knitter Ben Cuevas states “my work in knitting is an extension of feminist thoughts deconstructing American ideas of domesticity and handicrafts as the ‘women’s realm’ - I’m queering the gendered constructions of craft” (p. 137). Trans crochet artist Caroline Wells Chandler shares “I am interested in body liberation, body language, word play, the way text informs and writes the way we navigate in our bodies and how we use language to empower ourselves” (p. 158). This text as well as others explore the important role that fiber arts has had 17  on the queer community due in large part to its history and connection to domesticity and ‘women’s work’.  The Role of Sobriety in Queer Spaces      Fiber art spaces are becoming increasingly supportive to the queer community, with one important pro, they are a sober activity that is low in cost compared to a lot of the arts and is more accessible. It is understood through research that there is a lot of substance abuse within the queer community, and having groups like knitting circles that provide a space free of drugs or alcohol can help support that community can exist outside of nightlife. Which is a common place for people to connect, in fact “researchers have documented the importance of bars and clubs in the social lives of queer people since the 1920s and were critically important as ‘safe’ social spaces within which queer people could meet, socialize, and explore their identities without confronting societal stigmas. Queer bars and clubs provide a space for queer people ‘to step out of the hetero-normative world where they often feel” (Hunt et al., 2019). While it is important to have that space for queer people, the need for sober spaces grows and more queer people are seeing that “the predominance of alcohol-focused queer spaces call for a wider variety of more accessible social spaces” (p. 388).  Methods      Research conducted for this thesis was through a community arts-based project. While arts-based research (ABR) is a relatively new form of research, it is already being recognized as a supportive form of intervention. ABR allows for “responding to art to convey truth and awareness and generate preverbal forms of knowledge that engage sensory-emotional, perceptual, kinesthetic, embodied, and imagined ways of knowing” (Fonsekai et al., 2021). ABR 18  often allows for a more organic form of research which made sense for my thesis. I wanted to see the natural ways queer groups of people engage, and what they need and draw out amongst a group.  Participants  A community sample was used, an intentional choice because of the way it allows for me to see how strangers interact and who organically chooses to come to a group.  Recruitment took place in the form of mainly social media, the knitting shop it was held at posted about it on their Instagram and in their newsletter. Since the knitting shop already has knitting groups, they had some following. The group was also designed as a drop in, to also allow for its relaxed nature. I chose to not require the same people only go to both groups because I wanted to see if there were natural trends. Demographics were an interesting thing to observe and paralleled the research that most fiber art spaces are white dominated. There were mainly white femme people. There were few POC people. Few queer cis men. Lots of queer cis women. Most people did not know each other, most people sitting next to each other connected, talked, became friendly. Some people were really excited to help others, teach beginners.  Procedure  There were two groups total, both two hours long on Sunday afternoons at a local queer owned knitting shop in early January 2023.  Figure 1 Questions Presented to Participants 19    Step 1: Introductions: I first shared who I am, what my thesis is about and handed out a short handout I had created with an abstract, informed consent and a set of hypothetical questions for participants to think about but were not instructed to answer directly. Questions listed in figure 1.  Step 2:  All participants were asked to introduce themselves, give their name, pronouns, share what they are working on and what brought them in to the group.  Step 3:  participants were invited to ask any questions they had, or if they wanted to comment on anything so far.  This queer fiber arts group is to give us the opportunity to see how community care can support our mental health • How does coming together to create art support the concept of community care?  • How can experiencing queer only spaces expand our sense of belonging and create a stronger sense of self?  • What does safety feel like within these spaces as opposed to others?  • How could it support our healing as a community to have safe spaces where your identity is respected and shared?  • How has chosen family supported your mental health?  • How can community care build resilience?   20  Step 4: The provided materials were explained to participants, and they were instructed to begin working on their projects and talk amongst themselves.  Step 5: I spent the next hour going around to each individual participant and seeing how they were doing, looking at what they were working on and discussing any questions or thoughts they had.  Step 6: Closing: The two hours were quicky up everyone had been chatting and working on their projects, there was a short closing thanking everyone for coming participants were invited to share their email address in case they wanted to connect as a larger group or receive any updates.  The procedure of both groups were essentially the same, the difference lied in the energy and sense of connection built from the first group. With there being so much overlap in participants from the first to second group I chose to stay away from making the second group sound clinical, and allowed it to be a more relaxed environment.   Supplies:  • Knitting needles and crochet hooks • Yarn in various colors • Books from literature review, primarily books on queer fiber arts.  Location and Space  The groups were held in a seemingly small queer knitting shop in Boston. The room was tightly packed because so many more people came than expected. Some sat on the floor, creating small clusters of conversations.   21  Processing the Groups and Further Data Reflection • During the group some note taking was done, after groups more reflections were made in note book to pull out themes. • After second group, 6 of us went out to dinner in Cambridge to keep connecting.  • Immediately and consistently kept doing fiber arts and exploring the themes experienced around connection and process.  • Attended two local fiber markets which included wool, local spinner, dyers, fiber creators to witness more of the fiber art community.  • Experimented with different forms of fiber art including sewing, botanically dying wool and knitting.  • Continued to connect with participants from the groups to see their progress with their projects and share my own.  • Discussion with handful of group members to continue meeting to knit together.   Results   After fulfilling the procedure for the queer fiber art groups, and processing the data through a creative lens, there were many themes pulled out that support the literature. Including, queer identity and sense of self, community, identity politics, pleasure, connection and belonging and slow creative processes. These themes emerged from witnessing the fiber arts community as a whole, and fulfilling my own creative projects. There are many strong connections from my findings to the literature, especially surrounding the relationship between race, accessibility, and 22  community. The results showcase a consistency in who attends fiber art groups, with most participants being white and of a certain class, those that were able to afford supplies.  The results, however, do not touch on a major part of the literature, the role of mental illness within the queer community. The groups held, the community witnessed, and the external processing was full of joy, lightness, excitement, laughter and conversation. Themes pertaining to queer struggles such as trauma, disempowerment and isolation did not come through in processing the data. However, the data does coincide with the philosophies behind expressive art therapy and the power of the creative process to uplift and engage in pleasure.  The themes pulled out from the procedure are illustrated in figure 2. Table 1 illustrates the differences in the groups and overall results of the groups.  Table 1 Themes and Characteristics from the Group Themes and Characteristics Group 1 Group 2 Overall Feeling of the Group A stronger clinical tone, formal, slightly tense  People appearing uncomfortable  Relaxed  Casual conversation  Less structure Size of the Group 18 people 20 people Connection Participants appear timid  People beginning to build connection  Some participants asking for help  Skills sharing  Building small group connections  Half of the group returning from the last week to reconnect 23   Demographics Largely white AFAB people, cis or non binary Largely white AFAB people, more POC, more trans people   Figure 2  Themes from Reflections, Art Making, and Analysis  Discussion Slow Creative Process Many fiber artists engage in performance art to showcase the relationship between creative expression and the slowness of fiber arts. One example that inspired me years prior to this work Engaging in fiber artsQueerness/ femme spacesSlow process and organic processes pleasure, joy, fullillment Seeking local materailsCommunity and belongingAgency and developing a sense of self Healthy coping skills, supporting mental healthidentity politics and racism Whos \"allowed\" in what spaces, what spaces are accessiblesharing project updates and skill sharing24  was a piece done by Casey Jenkins called “Casting Off My Womb” where she spent 28 days in an art gallery knitting “Jenkins knitted a 15m long passage from yarn inserted daily in their vagina to mark one full menstrual cycle. The yarn was initially white, threaded slowly to red as it soaked with period blood, then back to white again.” (Jenkins, 2013).  Figure 3  Example of Slow Knitting Product  Another piece of queer fiber performance art that plays into similar themes is queer knitter Ben Cuevas in “Man's Body Woman's Work, I knit myself a flesh-like body suit, while in the nude, over the course of a full work week (Monday through Friday, 9 to 5). Here, I employ my identity as a male-bodied, genderqueer person, engaged in an activity historically associated with woman's work. This queering of gendered notions of work seeks to deconstruct deeply engrained, binary, cultural assumptions of work and gender.” (Cuevas, 2014).  Figure 4 Example of Critical Knitting Project 25   These artists and other inspired my own work to create pieces that are part of the slow process and relate to my own identity. I engaged in botanical fiber dying of wool as a slow process. I created dye baths made from vegetable scraps I had been collecting in my freezer of avocado pits and onion skins. I dyed wool in two forms, one was a fabric that I used for a sewing project, and the other was undyed yarn. See figure 4 for process photos.  Figure 4 Process Photos of Botanical Fiber Dying  With the fabric that was dyed, I sewed an herbal pillow. I filled it with dried lavender I had harvested in the fall, and mugwort, rose and flax. See figure 5 for product photos. Combining my dye bath drying dyed  wool completed skeins26  love for herbalism, wool and botanical dying felt like the perfect piece to represent the efforts that have gone into this thesis the last few months. Herbalism, fiber arts and botanical dying are all healing, seemingly intricate projects that require time, attention, planning and patience. They are all things that also require a relationship to the environment and help connect us to something larger. The use of plant and animal materials reminds me of the role of community, and the importance of slow practices.  Figure 5 Image of Artistic Product  Identity Politics and Racism   Demographics were a fascinating thing to witness and paralleled the research that most fiber art spaces are white dominated. The text This Long Thread (2021) speaks on this extensively, “[People of color] said that they felt excluded- underrepresented- in the craft community. That they don’t bother going to certain yarn stores because they fear being racially profiled…they no longer participate in knitting groups because of the microaggressions…because of the overwhelmingly white setting” (p.2).  It is possible to infer that POC did not feel they would be safe or represented going to a white owned fiber shop. 27  These overly common white populations were prevalent themes within my groups as well, the queer fiber group was mainly white femme people. There were few POC people and few queer cis men, and many white queer cis women. In an essay written in This Long Thread, by Shanel Wu (2021), a nonbinary queer Taiwanese American fiber artist they stated “I still felt in the margins, there was nowhere for me anywhere…even when I tried to find community in queer spaces, they were overwhelmingly white.” (p.253). This is a sentiment that may have been felt by POC who may have wanted to attend but did not want to feel isolated in their identity.  Playfulness and Pleasure  Playfulness, joy and pleasure were all themes I witnessed in my groups, and engaged in personally in my reflection process. Queer and Trans fiber artist, Caroline Wells Chandler, shares this sentiment on pleasure in the text Queer Threads, “Choosing joy is radical because joy is idiosyncratic pleasure and that destabilizes power as it currently exists.” (2017 p. 158). This also relates to the philosophy of Expressive Art therapy, that the process should be joyful and engaging. Halprin (2003) speaks on this in her text on EXAT, “when we are immersed creatively, we feel a sense of passionate aliveness, engaging our total and committed participation in life.” (p.85) This sentiment is a clear expression of how I feel about my process with creating.  Figure 6 Knitted Sweater as Part of the Process 28  I explored this theme through a sweater I knitted during this process. The pattern is called “Halibut” I used some of my favorite yarn from local artists, and found joy and excitement in making this garment. The colors, quality of the wool, joyfulness of the pattern and in the sharing of progress photos with fellow queer knitters made this a piece of great pride and happiness for me. This process to make a sweater was completed in approximately three weeks, and was very time intensive and I enjoyed the entire process.  Queerness Accomplishment and Healthy Coping Skills An important piece that I witness in myself as well as those around in my queer knitting community is that in creating garments, or wearable art there is a certain sense of accomplishment that inherently exists. A sense of pride, agency, empowerment in wearing something you took the time and effort to create. While I value the products I create, the process yarns and processfinishing the bodycompleted project29  is what makes the product so valuable. This is translatable to the efforts that go into building connection or healing trauma. It takes patience and skill to create that sense of empowerment or accomplishment. Not only does creating works of art support your sense of self, but they also help you develop the patience to do that challenging internal work. It is an external accomplishment that so affectively transfers internally.  Community  One of the initial drivers to hold queer fiber art groups was for my own desire for queer creative community. What was found in holding these groups was that I am not alone in that desire. Many queer people came, most of whom I didn’t know that were seeking queer community in a large heteronormative city. When introductions were asked of all the participants, almost all expressed a desire for queer friendships. Queer creative spaces outside of a bar or club can be challenging to come by in the Boston area. The creation of community was something I could witness both at these groups, in the ways people sought out new connections, but I was also able to see it in the local wool markets I attended. The Boston Farm and Fiber Festival was held in February, 30 venders from new England attended, selling their local fibers and holding classes, demonstrations and talks. The other event I attended, the Wayland Winters Farmer Market, Farm Fiber Day had over 50 venders and was overflowing with local fiber artists. Both events were bustling, packed with people excited to share their passion with others. Many other events happen often that focus on foster community. Such as the event in figure 6, Love Stories From the Farm.  Figure 7 Image of Love Stories from the Farm Initiative 30   Limitations  There was an obvious prevalence in white femme people in my groups. This illustrates a major point written about in some of the research on queer spaces, and creative spaces. Creative spaces, and the fiber arts community are white dominated. This serves as a limitation to my research, because my findings only showcase those of my similar demographics, white, femme, queer. This keeps the narrative limited because we are only getting one queer perspective. In future research, my hope would be for other queer groups to be represented and showcased. Another limitation being that this was a short-term group, and I was not allowed to collect more direct data due to legality issues. Future project designs would ideally include long term groups to showcase more in-depth case studies to further understand how fiber art communities and creative practices can support mental health.  Conclusion Holding queer fiber art circles provided insight into the ways community and creating can aid mental health. Through engaging with the community, I was able to see themes of creating connection, need for connection, shared joy and pleasure, and a desire to skill share, understanding and comradery of being of a common interest and identity, as well as the continuation of white supremacy in craft communities. Texts such as This Long Thread, Queer Threads, Care Work and Queering Psychotherapy were instrumental in grounding and fleshing 31  out themes uncovered in this work. The concepts of queer community support and the lack of agency and validation for marginalized communities are not new findings. However, these threads are new to being brought to the conversation amongst psychological research. The goal is that with time, this conversation is more commonplace, and changes are made to radicalize mental and medical healthcare for marginalized people in America.  To push this research further I would like to see long-term research done on these groups. With more data pulled out on the demographics of participants. Including: mental health history and current symptomology, a more a rounded story of each participant, the participants relationship to family, how coming out was for them, if they experienced internalized homophobia or bullying, if they have or had a queer community, and what their relationship attachments are like now. I would be curious to see the long term effects of fiber art communities on mental health and how creative community groups could impact mental health and attachment systems. I would also like to see more queer, BIPOC fiber artists finding the craft community more accessible and welcoming and how their intersecting identities play into the findings as well.        32   References Ayhan, C.

    "abstract": "This thesis explores the role of community and chosen family for queer belonging. The queer community is in a mental health crisis, with substance abuse, high suicide rates, anxiety, depression, personality disorders, and complex post-traumatic stress disorders being pervasive in the community. Current therapeutic services and medical services often enact more harm than good and that mutual aid and chosen family has been a cornerstone to support chronic illnesses. To better understand these complexities, a community arts project was held to explore how it might support these theories. This research was facilitated at a local queer owned Boston fiber shop. Groups were held for queer fiber artist in the Boston area of all ages and identities to explore a positive sense of self, safety, and belonging in the queer community. People from a range of neighborhoods came to experience togetherness and work on their current knitting, crochet, embroidery, felting projects. This research demonstrated the way joy and connection is created within in groups. As well as the importance of safe spaces for people to explore identity and creativity",
