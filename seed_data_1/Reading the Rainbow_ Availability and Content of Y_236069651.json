In fact, youth identifying as lesbian, gay, or \nbisexual are four times more likely to attempt suicide compared to their heterosexual \npeers; the rates are higher for transgender/transsexual youth. Various factors contributing \nto these rates include bullying, lack of acceptance, and lack of academic material \navailable to support LGBTQ+ youth (“Facts About Suicide”). Because of the severe need \nfor LGBTQ+ resources, high school libraries should offer more literature with queer* \ncharacters and teachers should practice bibliotherapy with these books in their \nclassrooms. Researchers Vare and Norton define bibliotherapy as “healing through \nliterature… and guiding someone’s reading to foster an understanding of self or to help \nsolve therapeutic needs” (2004, p. 190). In this same research, the authors articulate that \nthe foundation to using bibliotherapy, especially for LGBTQ+ youth, is having educators \nmake known that queer literature exists and is available for these students. However, \nwhile bibliotherapy is ideal in a group classroom setting, the likelihood of a queer book \nbeing taught in the classroom is still small. Thus, it is vital that these texts are still \navailable in high school libraries so students have the ability to find a book with a \ncharacter representing their own struggles in its bindings. This pilot study seeks to first \nascertain the number of queer books available in select Georgia high schools while \noffering a sample lesson for teachers wanting to use bibliotherapy in the classroom with \nqueer literature; next steps are included for future studies.   \n                                                            \n* Note: The term “queer” is now an accepted, encompassing term to include all sexual minority individuals. \nWhile controversial in the past, the term is used in academic settings while also being accepted by LGBT \norganizations. \nREADING THE RAINBOW  2 \n Researchers suggest that 5-6% of students in grades 7-12 identify as lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, queer, or other (Rossi, 2010); they further argue there are, on \naverage, 2.5 million teenagers that are a part of the LGBTQ+ community in the United \nStates alone (Rauch, 2010; Mehra & Braquet, 2011). These statistics imply that, \nregardless of location, there is a need for secondary school libraries to house literature \nrelating to queer issues as students within these high school populations can benefit from \nbeing able to find themselves within this literary genre, especially as the content relates to \ncoming out processes, acceptance, and suicide prevention.  \n Researchers Russell and Perrin (as cited by Mehra & Braquet, 2006, p. 2) report \nthe following statistics in relation to LGBTQ+ youth and suicide: “Sexual minority youth \nare among the most likely to report suicidality; what leads ‘queer’ youth to a suicidal path \nis not their sexuality but the stigma and discrimination they encounter in a heterosexual \nworld.” These findings are important for several reasons in relation to this study. 1) They \nsuggest that teens likely face stigma and discrimination against their orientation from \ntheir heterosexual peers, and 2) teens can often feel isolated from their peers, teachers, \nand communities through the coming out process, leading to these suicidal thoughts and \nideations. Because of these findings, several scholars suggest that media centers, as \nadvocates for the good of their patron base should leverage LGBTQ+ resources to \ncounter the negative stereotypes prevalent in secondary schools against this population \n(Vaillancourt, 2013). Mehra and Braquet (2006, p.3) further argue this point, writing:  \nLibraries have to advocate the next step forward that applies meaningful \nknowledge and translates progressive information into concrete actions to develop \nREADING THE RAINBOW  3 \nprofound community wisdom. Such community wisdom will allow individuals, \ngroups, and institutions to recognize and rejoice in their diversity, inclusive and \naccepting of “queer” individuals. \nBased on their research, if high school libraries house queer material, then teens can \nengage in bibliotherapeutic techniques to avoid the propensity toward suicide. In other \nwords, if a teen can find a book that relates a similar experience to what they are going \nthrough in their own life, they should be able to utilize the information in the book \ntowards their own issues in reality. Furthermore, non-LGBTQ+ students can benefit from \nthe housing of these materials as it allows them to become more understanding of their \nqueer classmates. Rauch (2011, p. 14) supports this stance, writing, “Access to stories \nwith characters who may be like his/her classmates or friends can help a teen reader be \nmore empathetic and understanding as s/he experiences vicariously the struggles and \nconfusion many LGBTQ teens go through.” As such, this study seeks to investigate the \nnumber of LGBTQ+ themed books housed in select high school media centers across the \nstate of Georgia based on American Library Association guidelines and past \nrecommendations for LGBTQ+ content in other academic studies.  \n \nPrior Research  \n According to Clyde and Lobban (2001), little data exist to explain how high \nschool libraries acquire LGBTQ+ material. In general, public high school media centers \noperate within a budget specified by the individual school for curriculum development \nprocesses. According to surveys conducted by the American Library Association, high \nschools, on average, have ~13,636 titles available at any given time. Additionally, in a \nREADING THE RAINBOW  4 \nsurvey conducted in 2012, collections grew an estimated 200 titles per year, though \nbudget spending has decreased overall (“School Libraries”).  While there is no survey \nconducted by the ALA that specifies the average number of LGBTQ+ books housed by \nsecondary schools, there have been studies undertaken in order to identify differences in \nnumbers of books relating to queer literature held by libraries across the United States in \naddition to other countries’ library collections.  \n Before expanding upon previous research studies undertaken in the field, it is \nimportant to note the appeals to include LGBTQ+ materials in libraries and the potential \nreasons for librarians to avoid them. As Williams and Deyoe (2015, p. 63) outline in their \ndiscussions on LGBTQ+ literature in libraries, as early as 1993, a “Massachusets task \nforce recommended including information in school libraries for gay and lesbian \nadolescents and providing education of families through information in public libraries.” \nIn addition, they note, in 2007, the National Council for Teachers of English “adopted a \nresolution urging teacher preparation programs to include LGBTQ issues and urging... \nmembers to address the needs of students who identify as LGBTQ” (Williams & Deyoe, \n2015, p. 63). However, even though declarations have been made to encourage the \ninclusion of these materials in secondary settings, queer books are still being left out of \ncollections. Reference librarian Jennifer Downey lists the following responses from \nlibrarians and their decisions for leaving this material out of their collections: “It’s hard to \nfind LGBT-themed books; They don’t circulate; What will it say about me?; There aren’t \nany (or many) LGBT people in my community; I don’t have the money in my budget” \n(2013, p. 105-106). While many of these are self-assumed assumptions, excepting the \nREADING THE RAINBOW  5 \nbudget and potentially circulation aspects, they still offer explanations for the limited \nfindings and minimal parallels across studies showcased below.  \n In looking at public libraries, Martin and Murdock (2007) found that 70% of teens \ncould locate LGBTQ+ materials in their public libraries, regardless of area. Another \nstudy looked at the differences between public libraries in five southeastern states, basing \nher study on the impact a fairness ordinance might have in public library holdings, which \nended up being no statistical difference. Interestingly, however, the researcher did find a \ndifference between diverse counties and non-diverse counties, with diverse counties \nbeing far more likely to hold an LGBTQ+ book (Stringer-Stanback, 2011). Another \nresearcher, Ritchie (2001), found that 97.6% of medium-sized public libraries in Illinois \nheld at least some form of an LGBTQ+ themed book, with ~12.7 books being held by \neach library. A single, in-depth analysis of one large, urban public library’s collection by \na researcher found ~80% of desired LGBTQ+ themed-books to be held in its catalog \n(Moss, 2008). While these studies seem to lean toward a more accepting rate of LGBTQ+ \nmaterials in public libraries, they offer mixed results with little comparative data across \nstudies.   \nMaking the bridge from public to the realm of academia, a study conducted in \n2003 investigated the differences in library collections, both public and academic, in \nOregon. Oberg and Klein (2003) found statistical differences between holdings based on \nlibrary size, type, and location. Additionally, an extensive study in 2013 found that public \nhigh school media centers in one southern state only held ~0.4% of “suggested” \nLGBTQ+ reading materials (Hughes-Hassel et al., 2013). However, a study conducted by \nOltmann (2015) sought to investigate the differences between high school media \nREADING THE RAINBOW  6 \ncollections in a northeastern and southern state, looking at differences in book holdings \nbased off of locale, political affiliation, and demographic diversity. Ultimately, she found \nno statistical difference in book holdings across the categories between states. \nFurthermore, Oltmann found that, in the northeastern state, urban schools held ~20 \nbooks, while suburban and rural schools held ~22 and ~23 books, respectively. In the \nsouthern state, however, urban schools held ~32 books on average, suburban held ~25 \nbooks, and rural schools held ~20 books. For the purpose of this pilot study, similar \nresearch methodologies to Oltmann are used, but minimizes the research variables to \nlocale only, as expanded upon in the Study Overview and Methods sections below.  \nStudy Overview \n As mentioned above, this study seeks to expand upon the work of Oltmann (2015) \nand others by looking closely at select secondary schools in the state of Georgia across \nthe different locales of urban, suburban, and rural. Based on the preliminary literature \nreview discussed, no study to date has performed an analysis of Georgia secondary \nschools by county, and few have looked at singular states’ high school libraries based on \ncounty demographic, choosing instead to look at enrollment figures and diversity, often \nleading to high schools being analyzed in the same county or, as Oltmann demonstrated, \nby comparing states’ demographics by region. Overall, this study seeks to look closer at \ncollection numbers county-by-county as opposed to broader, nonspecific comparisons in \nan effort to offer guidance for improvement on a state/county-specific level based on \nlocational differences.  \nThe prior research review leads to the following hypotheses. 1) On average, urban \nschools will hold more books of LGBTQ+ content, followed by suburban schools, and \nREADING THE RAINBOW  7 \nrural schools will hold the least. 2) Because librarians add an estimated 200 books/year \naccording to the information above, it is expected that LGBTQ+ books should make up \nan estimated 5-6% of these total additions. Therefore, it is also expected for each high \nschool media center collection analyzed, regardless of locale, to have, on average, 10 \nbooks (5% of 200) off of the master list.†  \n \nMethods \n In order to narrow the research group, Georgia counties were prepared on a grid \nin alphabetical order, Appling County to Worth County, and assigned numbers 1 to 159. \nThe classification of urban, suburban, and rural were operationally defined in close \nconjunction to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2016 categorizations with the exception of \nsuburban, as, to date, no procedural definition has been given by the Bureau to categorize \na suburban area. As a result, the categories used in this study are defined as follows: < \n20,000 People = Rural; 20,000-60,000 People = Suburban; 60,000 > = Urban. In other \nwords, if County A has a population of 45,000, its high school would be placed in the \nSuburban category. Twenty-seven counties or, approximately 1/6 of all counties in the \nstate of Georgia, were analyzed. Populations of each individual county were based off of \ncensus data conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2016. Counties were selected using \na random number generator from 1 to 159; however, in an effort to heighten statistical \naccuracy, equal numbers across each category were maintained (e.g. Nine Counties each \nwere needed). Once a category was filled, if a number came up that reflected a county \n                                                            \n† Consult the Limitations section for further explanation on why collection development was chosen. See \nTable 2 for the Master List.  \nREADING THE RAINBOW  8 \nalready in a full category, the county was discarded and a new number was randomly \nselected until all categories were filled. The final list of counties and their categorizations  \ncan be seen in Table 1 below. A color coded map of the counties selected can be seen in \nAppendix C.  \n In looking at ways to assess the availability \nof LGBTQ+ literature, analytics were based \nhighly on the studies conducted by Moss (2008) \nand Oltmann (2015) by utilizing a list-checking \nmeasure. In other words, a list of LGBTQ+ titles \nwere selected, and high school databases were \nanalyzed to determine the number of total books \nfound on the list. The title selections were based \non Oltmann’s (2015) “Top Ten Books Held By \nState” list in addition to the American Library \nAssociation’s 2015 “Rainbow Reading List” \nwhich was distributed to all librarians subscribing \nto the Association newsletter, which offers \ngeneral collection development guidance when \nselecting reading materials. Oltmann’s (2015) \nreading list was constructed based on previous \nwinners in the Lambda Literary Foundation Awards, Stonewall \nBook Awards, and the Rainbow Awards in addition to titles pulled from the book, Gay, \nLesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Teen Literature: A Guide to Reading \nCounty Locale \nCategorization \n(R=Rural; \nS=Suburban; \nU= Urban) \nBanks  R \nBleckley R \nButts S \nCharlton R \nClayton U \nColumbia U \nDawson S \nDouglas  U \nFannin S \nFulton U \nIrwin R \nJefferson R \nJackson U \nJones S \nLowndes U \nMcIntosh R \nMonroe S \nOconee S \nPike R \nSchley R \nSpalding U \nWalton U \nWare S \nUnion S \nWayne S \nWilcox R \nWhitfield U \nTable 1 \nREADING THE RAINBOW  9 \nInterests by Webber (2010). The list-checking measure was chosen due to the \ninconsistent subject labeling of queer books, with some libraries choosing the label under \nthe category LGBT or queer, while others may label under same-sex, homosexuality, or \ngay. In addition, the book titles on the Rainbow List are fairly newer titles, having been \npublished in 2013-2014. This list was chosen because it adds a clearer picture of a \nlibrary’s collection development efforts to obtain up-to-date LGBTQ+ literature; \nhowever, Oltmann’s list from her 2015 study was chosen because it represents the \ngeneral LGBTQ+ books that are housed in high school libraries. The compilation of lists \nyielded a total of 34 books to be investigated, all under the following genre categories: \nYoung Adult Fiction, Young Adult Non-Fiction, and Graphic Novel Non-Fiction. A full \nlist of the titles can be seen in Table 2.  \nTitle Author List Pulled From \nAfterworlds Scott Westerfeld Rainbow \nAm I Blue?

In \ntotal, an initial forty-nine databases were attempted for access, but twenty-two counties \nhad to be re-selected due to the inability to access their catalogs. However, twenty-seven \ndatabases were still able to be analyzed. As opposed to keeping the books segregated by \ngenre, books were summarized into one category for analytical purposes. All books \nremained of YA content as deemed appropriate for high school readers. A One-Way \nAnalysis of Variance test was conducted to determine if any statistical difference existed \nbetween the means of total books held based on locale.  \n \nResults \n The study found that the majority of high school media center databases sampled \nheld at least one LGBTQ+ themed book. Only one high school, located in Oconee \nCounty, held zero books relating to queer literature. A high school located in Jefferson \nCounty, on the other hand, held the most LGBTQ+ books on the list, holding 16 books in \nits collection. The first hypothesis of urban schools having the most books, followed by \nsuburban, and ending in rural, failed to be supported. On average, high schools in urban \nareas held ~10.11 books, high schools in suburban areas held ~5.44 books and high \nschools in rural areas held ~7.44 books; however, there was no statistical difference \nfound between the means. Collectively, Georgia high schools, regardless of locale, held \nan estimated 7.67 books on the list, or 22.56% of the total list, failing to support the \nsecond hypothesis that schools would hold at least 10 books off of the master list. \nHowever, the overall means percentage correlates well with the study conducted by \nREADING THE RAINBOW  12 \nTable 3 \n \nOltmann (2015) as she found the high schools analyzed in her chosen “southern state” \nheld 20.5% of the books on her list, which indicates a similarity between the findings. \nConsult Table 3, Table 4, and Figure 1 below for collection data, a list of the means, and \na graph of the means, respectively.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n  \n \nCounty Locale \nCategorization \n(R=Rural; \nS=Suburban; \nU= Urban) \n# of \nBooks in \nCollection \nBanks  R 3 \nBleckley R 7 \nButts S 4 \nCharlton R 5 \nClayton U 13 \nColumbia U 15 \nDawson S 11 \nDouglas  U 12 \nFannin S 11 \nFulton U 13 \nIrwin R 13 \nJefferson R 16 \nJackson U 9 \nJones S 8 \nLowndes U 8 \nMcIntosh R 8 \nMonroe S 5 \nOconee S 0 \nPike R 7 \nSchley R 2 \nSpalding U 9 \nWalton U 10 \nWare S 2 \nUnion S 5 \nWayne S 3 \nWilcox R 6 \nWhitfield U 2 \nREADING THE RAINBOW  13 \n  \nTable 4 \nFigure 1 \nREADING THE RAINBOW  14 \nTable 6 \nAn ANOVA test conducted on the variable of locale (Rural, Suburban, and \nUrban) is listed below in Table 5. The independent variable tested across the analysis was \nlocale with the dependent variable being number of books present in database. The F-\nvalue was 2.98 with a significance value of 0.07, indicating that the mean number of \nLGBTQ+ books was not significantly different across the category of locale, based on a \np= 0.05 level. A Post Hoc Tukey HSD test was undertaken to further investigate the \nfindings of the ANOVA test, as seen in Table 6. However, no significant difference was \nfound in the follow-up Post Hoc either, although the difference in means between Urban \nand Suburban high schools were the closest to reaching the significance level, 0.057 \nwhen p=0.05.  \n \nTable 5 \n \nREADING THE RAINBOW  15 \nDiscussion \n The results correlated well with past studies, especially the Oltmann (2015) study, \nbut it poses further questions for analysis of LGBTQ-themed literature. Because there \nwas no statistical difference between the average numbers of books found on the master \nlist based on locale, it would beg questioning whether locale is an important \nconsideration when analyzing the availability of queer literature. Furthermore, the list \nitself should be questioned—Are these titles truly representative of content appropriate \nfor LGBTQ+ youth? The titles Oltmann chose for her 2015 study seem to hold as \nrepresentative based on the high likelihood of a library owning the title, noting that the \nworks on her list are generally older than the titles on the Rainbow List. Oltmann’s titles \nselected for this study are as follows: The Perks of Being a Wallflower; Will Grayson, \nWill Grayson; My Heartbeat; Ask the Passengers; Hard Love; Every Day; Am I Blue?; \nSomeday this Pain will be Useful to You; Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the \nUniverse; Annie on My Mind; Skim; October Mourning: A Song for Matthew Shepard; \nBeauty Queens; Last Exit to Normal; Shine. A detailed description of how her titles were \nselected can be found in the Methods section above. The Rainbow List, on the other \nhand, is selected by reference librarians associated with the ALA who “evaluated over \n140 books from small, independent, and large publishers, and selected 24 books from 15 \npublishers for the 2015 Rainbow Book List” (“Rainbow Book List”). The full list is \nincluded in Appendix A with attached summaries of each title selection, and based on the \nnovel summaries and the fact that librarians chose the books for the list, their contextual \nrelevancy for queer youth appears accurate. It should be noted that the list fails to \nREADING THE RAINBOW  16 \ncategorize each authors’ sexuality, which may be another variable to consider when \ndiscussing content accuracy for young readers.  \nAlongside the question of content accuracy/relevancy, several other questions for \nmethodology persist. For instance, would results have been more statistically striking had \nthe databases been searched by subject-specific phrases (e.g. Homosexuality, Queer, \nLGBT, etc.) as opposed to titles? In addition, even though there was no difference \nbetween schools based on locale, the overall means of each high school still appeared low \nin comparison to a school’s total library collection. Better diagnostic criteria might be \nneeded in order to determine the true proportions of a schools’ collection of non-\nLGBTQ+ vs. LGBTQ+ material based on school population data. On that note, school \ndemographic data also fails to report the amount of students who identify on the \nLGBTQ+ spectrum or of students who are questioning their sexuality; while the \nusefulness of such a survey is morally questionable, it would help determine the true \nproportional-accuracy of a media centers’ collection.  \n \nLimitations \n Because this is a pilot study, several limiting factors should be noted. Being an \nundergraduate level thesis project, time and resources were heavily constricted, leading to \nthe creation of a pilot study as opposed to a full-scale research project. This resulted in \nselect counties being randomly selected for analysis while being limited to school \ndistricts who opted to make their library catalogs available to the general public. A \nlimited book list was utilized instead of a more encompassing list, which could also have \nimpacted the results. Furthermore, only the category of books were searched while other \nREADING THE RAINBOW  17 \nmediums such as film could have been evaluated for availability across the different \ncatalogs. Other limitations included the lack of school-specific data listing budgets for \ncollection development efforts and the lack of data showing the total number of books in \neach school’s catalog. These were perhaps the major limitations as it resulted in the \nhypotheses leaning towards collection development averages on the national scale as \nopposed to individual school’s averages. In other words, it would have been viable to say \na high school library may hold 5% of LGBTQ+ books in their entire catalog, but it is \nimpossible to make this claim without the total collection numbers for the school. This \nfact, combined with the problematic subject classifications already discussed, led to the \ncurrent methodologies being used. Although, even with the limitations listed, this study \nstill retains value as a pilot and provides insight into future directions for more in-depth \nresearch.  \n \nNext Steps/Practical Application for Pedagogy \n As a pilot, this study is highly preliminary in nature and further steps should be \ndiscussed. In looking at expanding this research, a high school media centers’ budget \nwould likely be ascertained in addition to the true average number of books acquired year \nover year. This would allow a second variable to be added to the ANOVA and a \ndifference of means would be expected. Additional independent variables to be \nconsidered for future studies include: The presence of a Gay-Straight Alliance or similar \norganization, a county’s self-adoption of an HR anti-discrimination policy for sexual \norientation, the presence of a PFLAG chapter in the county, or the number of religious \ninstitutions in the county. Recalling Downey’s (2013) article in the literature review, \nREADING THE RAINBOW  18 \nmedia centers often only have one full-time media specialist making all of the collection \ndevelopment decisions, so it would be useful to interview each media specialist at each \nhigh school selected in order to obtain their view towards LGBTQ+ works, as their \ndecisions on purchasing content are largely their own educated preferences.  \n In looking ahead to practical uses, LGBTQ+ texts could presumptively be used in \nthe classroom setting for bibliotherapeutic uses, as mentioned in the Introduction.  \nSuggestions for integration of a text on the master list (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) \ninto the classroom context while using bibliotherapy can be seen in Appendix B. It is \nimportant to note that the novel’s protagonist identifies as straight/questioning, but has a \nbest friend who identifies as gay. This allows the novel to be integrated more easily into \nthe curriculum with less chance of a “challenge” raised by other educators or \nadministrators.

Please note that this does not offer a full comprehensive \nteaching plan nor does it dictate the assignment of reading passages or \nsummative assessments. This merely serves as a brainstorm of ideas as to how \nthe novel could be used in the classroom context for the purpose of \nbibliotherapy. As the research is expanded, the list of brainstorm ideas could \nbe expanded and used as experimental starting points for pedagogical uses.  \n \n*Note: Many of these activities are highly narrative focused, so would likely \ntake place in a class where these types of standards are the main focus, such as \n9th Grade, in the State of Georgia.  \n \nPrior to Reading:  \n \nWhen opening the Unit, the instructor might begin by having students \ncomplete an anticipatory set to place themselves not only in the perspective of \nthe novel, but also get them in the mindset of self-reflection. Students would be \npresented with a list of statements and they would need to circle whether they \nAgree or Disagree with the statement being made. The exercise would be \nrepeated at the novel’s closure to see if, after reading, students’ opinions \nchanged. The following questions are examples of what could be asked:  \n \n1. Often, adults cannot truly remember what it was like being a teenager.  \n2. It is possible for a kiss between friends to mean nothing.  \n3. Teenagers are far more likely to tell their friends their problems as \nopposed to adults.  \n4. The music we listen to often reflects our own values or beliefs.  \n5. Books are able to help teenagers through problems.  \n6. Experiencing situations yourself helps build empathy with others.  \n7. People can block out traumatic events in their life.  \n8. All students face bullying to some extent.  \nREADING THE RAINBOW  25 \n \n*Note: These questions should refrain from asking questions about personal \nbeliefs regarding LGBTQ+ students, especially in the opening of the unit. The \ngoal of an educator is not to campaign against changing students’ beliefs, but \nto help them be accepting of others who may be different. With that being said, \nthe educator should be transparent with students and parents in regards to the \nthemes and characters the book possesses (e.g. LGBTQ+ characters, sexual \nactivity among all sexualities, drug use, rape, mental illness, etc.).  \n \nDuring Reading:  \n \nThe novel utilizes a letter-writing approach wherein the main character, \nCharlie, writes letters to an unknown reader. While reading, students should \nwrite letters back to Charlie after reading 1-2 chapters, reflecting on the events \nof the chapter. Students should address their own concerns about Charlie’s \nactions and the actions of his friends. The instructor should provide specific \nprompts for each unit, but also allow students creative freedom in some \naspects of the novel. Sample prompts might include:  \nA) Reactions to Charlie’s “gay, best friend” and his closeted relationship \nB) Responding to the definition of “healthy relationships” (is any \nrelationship in the novel a “healthy relationship?) \nC) Can you trust Charlie as a narrator? Would you trust him as a friend?  \nD) How is mental illness represented in the novel?  \n \nStudents may also be required to write their own “life story” thus far in their \nlives, as Charlie has. The instructor should indicate that any forms of abuse or \nquestionable behavior will have to be legally reported. However, in these two \nexercises, students are taking part in the main components of bibliotherapy as \nthey are actively engaged with the text, responding to the characters’ thoughts, \nmotivations, choices, and relationships and then having to write their own \nstory. By doing these activities in this order, students internalize their feelings \nof Charlie’s choices into their own self-analyses of their lives/past choices.  \n \nStudents should be encouraged to read/share their journal letters in small, \ndiverse groups selected by the instructor to engage one another in class \ndiscourse. The groups should have similar prompts as the journals as well, in \nthat they should all work together to help Charlie or another character \novercome some sort of situation he/she is struggling with (e.g. Drugs, child \nabuse, suicide, coming out, relationships, rape, etc.). By disguising these \ndiscussions in relation to the characters, the students do not feel as though they \nare “counseling” their peers, but, in reality, this is exactly what is happening.  \n \nAfter Reading:  \nREADING THE RAINBOW  26 \n \nAs the novel relies heavily on reading lists as well as “mixtapes,” students \nshould create a mixtape or reading list that describes their own life (based on \nthe story of themselves submitted during reading) and also create a mixtape or \na reading list for a fellow classmate. This helps demonstrate empathetic ties \nbetween students as well as provides self-reflective techniques that can be \nuseful for students dealing with mental illness as well as coming out issues, \ntwo themes the novel addresses. The students should also respond once more \nto the anticipatory set statements given prior to reading the novel to see if any \nchange has occurred.  \n \nDisclaimer: The instructor should take careful attention to be involved heavily \nin the group discussions as well as to stress the importance of non-judgment to \nfellow peers/classmates beliefs. The point of bibliotherapy is to build empathy \nwith their classmates as well as to build better self-reflection with one’s self \nwhen reading. While this process is no easy task, the rewards for students, \neither queer or non-queer, are immeasurable.  \n \n \n \n \n*These ideas were inspired by Ryan Nelson and some parts of the list are modified \nfrom his original unit plan, specifically the Anticipatory Set and Letters to Charlie. \nWhile Nelson’s ideas do not all correlate with bibliotherapy, he does offer a general \noverview of teaching the novel in class.

    "abstract": "Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, and other sexual minority, or LGBTQ+, youth are at high risk for suicide. In fact, youth identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual are four times more likely to attempt suicide compared to their heterosexual peers; the rates are higher for transgender/transsexual youth. Various factors contributing to these rates include bullying, lack of acceptance, and lack of academic material available to support LGBTQ+ youth (“Facts About Suicide”). Because of the severe need for LGBTQ+ resources, high school libraries should offer more literature with queer* characters and teachers should practice bibliotherapy with these books in their classrooms. Researchers Vare and Norton define bibliotherapy as “healing through literature… and guiding someone’s reading to foster an understanding of self or to help solve therapeutic needs” (2004, p. 190). In this same research, the authors articulate that the foundation to using bibliotherapy, especially for LGBTQ+ youth, is having educators make known that queer literature exists and is available for these students. However, while bibliotherapy is ideal in a group classroom setting, the likelihood of a queer book being taught in the classroom is still small. Thus, it is vital that these texts are still available in high school libraries so students have the ability to find a book with a character representing their own struggles in its bindings. This pilot study seeks to first ascertain the number of queer books available in select Georgia high schools while offering a sample lesson for teachers wanting to use bibliotherapy in the classroom with queer literature; next steps are included for future studies",
