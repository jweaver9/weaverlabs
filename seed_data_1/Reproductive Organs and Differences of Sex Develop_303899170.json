INTRODUCTIONParents wait anxiously while their two-month-old daughter undergoes routinehernia surgery.' During the surgery, the doctor discovers that their child hasundescended testes in her stomach, and not the expected female reproductiveorgans.2 With the infant still on the operating table and under anesthesia, thedoctor exits the surgery and requests that the parents give their consent to removethe testes. Can the parents consent to a surgery that substantially affects thechild's adulthood? Would the child's testes allow her to be fertile in atraditionally masculine sense despite her outwardly feminine appearance? Couldshe be fertile today or in the future with medical advances?The situation is even more complicated when a child is clearly fertile.Consider a fifteen-year-old male who is experiencing menstrual bleeding throughhis penis.' The parents have known for some time that he has a uterus andovaries, but no testes.4 However, in hopes of preserving his \"male\" self-image,the parents have not disclosed this information to the teen. Now, they want thedoctor to perform a hysterectomy6 while keeping the purpose of the surgerysecret from the patient. Although the teenage male is currently fertile, he wouldneed medical intervention for fertilization and delivery in the future. In otherwords, this hysterectomy would sterilize him.1. While based on real cases, this situation was generalized by Anne Tamar-Mattis in Exploring GrayAreas in the Law About DSD and Sterilization: Legal Rules About Parental Consent Are Different whenFertility Is on the Line, ENDOCRINE TODAY, Oct. 1, 2009, http://www.endocrinetoday.com/view.aspx?rid=44415 [hereinafter Exploring Gray Areas] (on file with the McGeorge Law Review).2.

DSDsare conditions that involve atypical \"male\" and \"female\" physicalcharacteristics,9 but that definition depends on who is doing the defining.'Scholars estimate that one in 1500 children are born with a DSD of some kind,the obviousness of which may range from those not evident to an untrainedobserver to a completely indeterminate sex based on physical observation.\" Infact, some intersex individuals may have conditions so subtle that they may neverknow they are intersex.12 One method of determining sex-as opposed togender-depends on three physical characteristics: (1) the sex chromosomeconfiguration, 3  (2) the internal reproductive organs, and (3) the externalreproductive organs.14  An inconsistency between one or more of thesecharacteristics is a DSD. As a practical matter, however, sex is normallydetermined by a glance at the external genitalia immediately after birth. Whenthe birth attendant is uncertain based on that glance, doctors analyze the variouscharacteristics of the child to make a diagnosis, and then they assign a sex basedon the likeliest outcome of that diagnosis.\" The traditional standard of care for8. These conditions are also referred to as \"intersex\" or \"disorders of sex development.\" Thenomenclature issue is contentious and emotional. The author has attempted to follow a middle path by using thealternative meaning for DSD, \"differences of sex development,\" to describe intersex conditions, while using\"intersex\" to refer to individuals with these conditions.9. DSDs are physical conditions, which means that individuals with DSDs may be straight, gay,bisexual, transgender, or transsexual.

Interview with Anne Tamar-Mattis, Director, Advocates for Informed Choice (Oct. 14, 2010) (onfile with the McGeorge Law Review).8432011 /Reproductive Organs and Differences of Sex Developmentthe treatment of DSDs often involves the removal of external and/or internalreproductive organs.'\" External reproductive organs are primarily removed oraltered to make the child's physical appearance similar to a standardized versionof the child's assigned gender. Doctors primarily remove internal reproductiveorgans to prevent hormone production 7 that might create bodily changes duringand after puberty that are at odds with the outward appearance or assignedgender. Additionally, they may also remove them to reduce an elevated cancerrisk (sometimes reasonably and sometimes not).While sterilization (in the sense of the purposeful ending of fertility) is not,as a general rule, the stated intention of these surgeries, the removal ofreproductive organs nonetheless raises some pertinent ethical, medical, and legalissues. Fertility is inherently speculative even when a person possesses all the\"correct\" reproductive organs. Sterilization involves the removal of reproductiveorgans. Whether or not these surgeons intend to do so, they are, in effect,sterilizing the child when they elect to remove his or her reproductive organs.This election should be considered independently of the child's actual orpredicted fertility.The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized procreation as afundamental constitutional right. ' As a result, parental consent on the child'sbehalf may not be legally sufficient for surgeries that require removal ofreproductive organs, even for purposes of treating DSDs. Moreover, suchsurgeries may violate state constitutional rights, such as the California16. See Peter E. Lee et al., American Academy of Pediatrics, Consensus Statement on the Managementof Intersex Disorders, 118 PEDIATRICS e488 (2006) [hereinafter Consensus Statement] (establishing astandardized approach to the nomenclature and treatment of DSDs). This is not a \"side effect\" because thatwould suggest an unintended result.17.

See Skinner v. Okl. ex rel Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942) (\"There is no redemption for theindividual whom the [sterilization] law touches. Any experiment which the State conducts is to his irreparableinjury. He is forever deprived of a basic liberty.\"); Carey v. Population Servs. Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 685 (1977)(\"The decision whether or not to beget or bear a child is at the very heart of this cluster of constitutionallyprotected choices. That decision holds a particularly important place in the history of the right of privacy ....This is understandable, for in a field that by definition concerns the most intimate of human activities andrelationships, decisions whether to accomplish or to prevent conception are among the most private andsensitive.\").844McGeorge Law Review / Vol. 42Constitution's right to privacy.20 However, courts may distinguish theseprocedures by separating them into at least four categories: (1) immediately life-preserving treatments (as in cancerous and precancerous cells); (2) potentiallylife-preserving treatments (as in conditions with a higher likelihood of gonadalcancer in adulthood); (3) function-preserving treatments; and (4) appearance-related treatments. Arguably, only the first category justifies immediate treatmentauthorized by surrogate consent.In other kinds of medical treatment for minors and the mentally disabled,courts have decided that parental consent may be inadequate to authorize certainprocedures.2 1 In those specialized situations, hospitals, doctors, and parents haveutilized judicial hearings to ensure that the child's due process rights areprotected and that a neutral third party is involved in the decision-makingprocess.22 These same protections can be applied to a new category of caseswithout the need for creating a new paradigm of protections. At a minimum,children with DSDs are being deprived of their right to bodily integrity; thus,they require procedural due process protections to preserve their right toprivacy.23 These children are also likely deprived of the right to procreate, whichis also part of the right to privacy. Normally, a parent's medical decision ispresumed to uphold the child's constitutional rights. An essential part of thisjudicial hearing process is the appointment to the minor of a guardian ad litem orattorney who assumes a legal and ethical obligation to presume that the childwould oppose the actions of the parents. In the DSD context, children need anindependent voice to represent their future procreative interests, and the judicialhearing process can provide those substantive and procedural due processprotections. Parents are making medical decisions for medical choices that willtake place decades in the future and those future medical treatments could besignificantly different and/or advanced from what is available today.This Comment argues that, because of the uncertainty inherent in definingsuch concepts as \"fertility,\" for twenty, thirty, or forty years in the future, judicialhearing procedures should apply to the removal of any reproductive organ, either20.

Many states already mandate judicial hearings beforeapproving the intentional sterilization of an individual with mental disabilitieswho is incapable of consenting to medical treatment.24 States could easily extendthese protections to children with DSDs who are in danger of havingreproductive organs removed. This Comment argues that the current Californiastatutory protections for the mentally-disabled provide a workable and naturalalternative to the current parental informed consent model while adequatelyprotecting children's constitutional rights.This Comment's analysis is divided into six parts. Part II provides a briefoverview of the DSD standard of care and the medical standard this Commentproposes. Part III examines the constitutional legal background, and includes anoverview of the parental/surrogate informed consent process that hospitals anddoctors currently use to secure informed consent for surgeries removing a child'sreproductive organs. This section also discusses the fundamental rights of parentsand children, and the interplay between those rights. Part IV presents the federalConstitutional backdrop of the fundamental constitutional rights of children. PartV examines the California approach to surgeries that sterilize the mentallyincompetent. Part VI presents an overview of similar DSD cases in othercountries. Part VII argues that surgical treatments that remove reproductiveorgans implicate the fundamental right to procreate for children with DSDs, andthat the current parental informed consent standard is insufficient for giving up achild's fundamental rights to bodily integrity, privacy, and procreation. ThisComment ultimately concludes that a judicial hearing process with adequateprocedural protections is better able to protect a child's interests than the totallack of protections today.II. THE MEDICAL STANDARD OF CAREIdeally, a medical standard of care is the product of time, study, andexperimentation.25 Unfortunately, the scientific method of testing and retesting to24. See, e.g., In re Grady, 426 A.2d 467 (N.J. 1981) (finding that New Jersey law requires a judicialhearing to allow parents to consent to the sterilization of their mentally disabled daughter and requiring clearand convincing proof that the sterilization is in the best interest of the patient); A.L. v. G.R.H., 325 N.E.2d 501(Ind. 1975) (finding that the common law does not authorize a parent to sterilize her brain-damanged child); Inre M.K.R., 515 S.W.2d 467 (Mo. 1974) (finding that even the courts did not have jurisdiction to approve aparent's request to sterilize a child with mental disabilities without express statutory approval); Ruby v. Massey,452 F. Supp. 361, 366 (D. Conn. 1978) (finding that parents \"may neither veto nor give valid consent to thesterilization of their children\"); In re Guardianship of Hayes, 608 P.2d 635 (Wash. 1980) (finding that a parentcannot consent to the sterilization of a child with mental disabilities and that there is a \"heavy presumption\"against sterilization); and In re Moe, 432 N.E.2d 712 (Mass. 1982) (finding that individuals with mentaldisabilities enjoy the same constitutional right to privacy and procreation as any other individual; however, thisfinding allowed the court jurisdiction to entertain parental requests for the sterilization of their children).25. See Hazel Glenn Beh & Milton Diamond, An Emerging Ethical and Medical Dilemma: ShouldPhysicians Perform Sex Assignment on Infants with Ambiguous Genitalia?, 7 MICH. J. OF GENDER & L. 1, 12-15 (2000) (describing the irregular occurrence when \"standard medical practice sometimes develops from case846McGeorge Law Review / Vol. 42determine an appropriate standard is not always readily available or practicablein certain situations.26 The treatment of DSDs developed largely from a singlecase study, Dr. John Money's \"John/Joan\" study.27 The standard he developedrecommended genital surgery and hormone treatment to \"normalize\" infants withDSDs, urged secrecy by both doctors and parents, and admonished parents toraise the child strictly in the assigned gender.\" To date, this standard still has notbeen proven medically or psychologically beneficial, and no patient has everstepped forward to defend the practice despite heavy public and academiccriticism.In 1967, Money was a medical visionary.29 Following his own psychologicaltheories, he believed that nurture, not nature, determined gender.30 A botchedcircumcision gave him the opportunity to test his theory.3' Because the damage tothe infant's penis was severe and reconstructive surgery would have been unableto restore it, Money convinced the parents to consent to the surgical creation of avagina and the removal of the child's testes.32 Because the child had an identicalmale twin, the experiment \"came bundled with a built-in control,\" making it an33ideal test case. Under Money's guidance, the parents strictly raised their son\"John\" as their daughter \"Joan\" after the surgery, thus emphasizing nurture overnature.34 Despite the parents' best efforts, \"Joan\" rebelled against her genderassignment even as a toddler and at the age of fourteen chose to live as a male.However, Money falsified his research about \"Joan,\" claiming that she was areports, word-of-mouth and the gradual clinical acceptance of innovative therapy without true scientific scrutinyof its effectiveness\").26.

In 2004, he committed suicide at the age of thirty-eight.42Today, Money's standard of care is changing, though slowly. While thetraditional DSD parental informed consent model was based upon \"urgency,partial and inaccurate disclosure of the conditions and risk, [and] a sense ofsecrecy and shame,\" the medical community is backing away from that model.43However, many believe that change is not occurring fast enough.4 Regardless ofwhether changes are made to the current model, the problem remains that aparent may not legally be able to consent to a DSD treatment that removes his or36.

This argument is stronger for the removal of internal reproductive organsthan for the alteration or removal of external reproductive organs because onecan tie those reproductive organs closer to the likelihood of fertility due to beingthe source of eggs and sperm. While there is a key distinction to be madebetween fertility and sterilization, to date, that distinction has not been part of thediscourse on DSD treatment.III. CURRENT LEGAL AUTHORITY FOR THE MEDICAL CARE OF CHILDRENA. Parental Authority and Substituted ConsentThe current legal standard for DSD treatments is parental informed consent.48Nearly every medical treatment of a minor relies on the parental informedconsent model.49 Parental informed consent is entirely removed from the judicialprocess and requires no approval by a neutral third party.o While medicalethicists argue that young children should assent to medical care and teenagersshould consent,\"' the law requires neither.\" The Supreme Court of the UnitedStates recognizes a legal presumption that a parent acts in the best interest of his45. Doctors who perform these procedures may also be liable for violations of the child's civil right toprocreate in the future under the same statute. 42 USC § 1984.46. This surgery left Reimer infertile. See, e.g., Colapinto, Gender Gap, supra note 35 (noting thatMoney told Reimer's parents that their child would grow up to be a \"sterile woman,\" but capable ofheterosexual intercourse).47. The author does not argue that all children with DSDs are entitled to this judicial hearing process,only those children whose reproductive organs may be removed should be constitutionally entitled to theseprocedural protections.48.

The courts will always intervene,however, when the child's life or well-being is in danger and the parents are notproviding \"standard medical care.\"\" Nonetheless, the courts will generally deferto the parents' choice of treatment so long as the proposed treatment isconsidered acceptable medical care--even if endorsed by only a small minorityof medical practitioners .\"53.

The use of shaping850McGeorge Law Review / Vol. 42The two most common exceptions to the parental presumption are organdonation proceduress and procedures with the primary purpose of sterilization(generally of the mentally disabled or mentally ill).6 ' There are three primaryconcerns that cause the courts to override parental consent: (1) the parents'potential conflict of interest; (2) the impairment of the child's fundamental rights;and (3) the lack of medical benefit to the child.62 Arguably, all three concernsexist in the cases addressed by this Comment. Part VI addresses the first twoconcerns. The third concern is better left to other authors and activists, thoughthere is a short discussion in Part V(A) that may independently justify theremoval of treatment decisions from parents.63 One should note that the calls for amoratorium on childhood DSD treatment tend to focus on external genitalinterventions does not deprive a child of lifesaving treatments or involve drug treatment, abortion, orinstitutionalization.Although shaping interventions implicate a child's rights to bodily integrity, theydo so no more than other cases involving the use of medical and surgical interventions. And where aparent chooses to use medicine or surgery for a child (as opposed to when a parent refuses medicineor surgery) courts are generally unwilling to consider the child's best interests when the desiredintervention has the support of even one licensed medical provider.Id.60. In the organ donation context, courts are hesitant when one minor child is being asked to donate to asibling, fearing that the parents are unable to consider the best interests of both children.

For example, female-gendered children with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)6 require noexternal genital surgery, although doctors would likely seek to remove internalundescended or partially-descended testes. If doctors or courts adopt amoratorium on infant external genital surgery without developing an overarchinglegal framework, children such as these may continue to have hormonally-motivated surgeries to remove their internal reproductive organs before reachingthe age of consent.B. The Rights of ChildrenThe Supreme Court has recognized that children have full constitutionalrights that co-exist with parental rights.6 However, parents sometimes exercisethese constitutionally-protected rights on their child's behalf, particularly those67rights that relate to their ability to consent to or decline medical treatment. Noperson may be deprived of \"life, liberty, or property, without due process oflaw.\"8 Due to cases like Griswold v. Connecticut09 and Roe v. Wade,0 the rightsto privacy and procreation are considered liberties under the Fourteenth7'Amendment, and children are considered \"persons\" for due process purposes.Because the law considers children to be legally incompetent persons, their rightsare exercised through legal surrogates who consent on the child's behalf.\" Theserights include the right to autonomy,73 the right to privacy,74 the right to bodily64. See supra note 63 and accompanying text (noting articles calling for a moratorium on \"genitalnormalization\" surgeries).65.

The Rights of the Patient Unable to Provide ConsentFor over forty years, courts and legislators have considered the quandary ofhow to protect the procreative rights of those individuals with mental disabilitieswho are unable to manifest informed consent for birth control and sterilizationprocedures. The right to procreate is the personal right to make an informedchoice whether to have children.\"In the usual DSD case, the only incapacity suffered by the patient is infancy,which is an incapacity that cures itself with time-time these children generallyhave.6 The only DSD that potentially presents a medical emergency at birth orsoon thereafter is virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia (virilizing CAH).\"784. See Exceptions to the Rule, supra note 18, at 107 n.356.There are several political and practical problems with this strategy. These include the fact that thestatute's language seems to exclude some, and arguably all, genital-normalizing surgeries on intersexinfants. ... Another problem is that it is a criminal statute-it seems unlikely that the public wouldapprove criminal sanctions on the doctors who perform [DSD] surgeries....

This surgery can be delayed until the child is able tomeaningfully participate in the decision-making process-there is no need for thesurgery to take place when the child is an infant or toddler.It is important to note that if the gonads have already developed cancerouscells, no court approval is necessary for parents to consent to their removalbecause, in this case, the surgery is a medical necessity.9 ' Therefore, if noprecancerous or cancerous cells have yet developed, parents should seek judicialapproval for the removal of the testes.

However, the intent of the surgery should not matter since the act ofsterilization itself is the constitutional violation.The most recent controversy to raise these issues is the 2004 case of AshleyX.

This latent right tovote exists, even though it cannot be readily exercised. As another example, achild is not legally competent to marry, but the child's right to choose a spouseupon attaining the age of consent cannot be infringed by parents \"irrevocably[betrothing the child] to someone.\"' Likewise, parents cannot force a child tomarry, even if state law permits the teen to marry with parental consent.124Similarly, a young child has the right to procreate, even though he or she may notyet be physically capable of doing so. While constitutional law limits a parent'sability to force or deny an abortion, it does not currently forbid parents frompreventing procreation in the first place by removing the reproductive organs.V.

When Is an Individual with Mental Disabilities Able to Consent toSterilization?The ability of an individual with mental disabilities to consent to sterilizationis defined by statute. In California, the average sterilization patient must consentvoluntarily and fully understand the nature and consequences of sterilization.1'Anyone capable of consenting to sterilization (or potentially able to consent inthe future) cannot be sterilized with substituted consent under the proceduresoutlined below.128  Consent is determined by whether the individual fullyunderstands the nature and consequences of sterilization.129Because procreation is a personal right and choice, 30 courts do not allowanother person to consent to sterilization on behalf of a temporarily incapacitatedpatient.\"' California law requires that the patient's \"incapacity is in all likelihoodpermanent.\" 32 If medical evidence suggests that the patient may eventuallydevelop the ability to consent to medical treatment, courts have shown awillingness to protect the patient's ability to choose his or her own medical care.and the disabled. See In re Conservatorship of Valerie N., 40 Cal.3d 143 (1985) (finding that California statutesthat prohibited anyone from consenting to the sterilization of the mentally disabled deprived these individuals oftheir right to privacy and liberty, specifically by not allowing females with mental disabilities to have the sameprocreative right to sterilization as other females). Notably, in the earliest stages of sterilization law, the goalwas to \"asexualize\" a prison or mental institution inmate, which was extended to the mentally disabled in 1917.Id. at 151. See Stats. 1909, ch. 720, § 1, pp. 1093-94 (\"[I]f in their opinion, or in the opinion of any two ofthem, asexualization will be beneficial to such inmate, patient, or convict, they may perform the same . . . .\").California, \"a pioneer in the field,\" performed nearly eighty percent of the statutory sterilizations in the UnitedStates during the years 1907-1921.

Interestingly, in orderto allow substituted consent, California law implicitly requires that an individualwith mental disabilities must have reached the age of majority.' This minimumage requirement suggests that the Legislature sought to ensure that the patient ispermanently unable to consent to medical treatment, particularly since theprocreative \"risks\" 3 6 may exist as much as a decade before this minimum age.Notably, one California statute provides that no institutionalized minor maybe sterilized.' The presumed legislative intent of this statute is that thesterilization decision is one that is better left to an adult to make for him- orherself. On the other hand, in the case of intersex children, parents and doctorsgenerally contend that early surgical intervention (before school age) is beneficialbecause they hope to give children \"normal\" childhoods-a benefit that would belost by waiting until the child reaches the age of consent.' Other articles'3 9maintain, however, that these contentions are based upon false assumptions, suchas the fact that American schools have almost universally abandoned the \"gymclass changing room/shower\" scene that plagues the minds of these doctors andpopular society.'4 The question then becomes whether a \"normal childhood\"outweighs the constitutional rights of the child.B.

Thesection states, \"[t]his chapter does not prohibit medical treatment or surgeryrequired for other medical reasons and in which sterilization is an unavoidable ormedically probable consequence, but is not the object of the treatment orsurgery.\" 49 In this case, the Legislature appears to recognize that when overallhealth is involved, the right to procreate may be compromised.

How COURTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ADDRESSED THE STERILIZATIONOF CHILDRENWhile no on-point American case law exists dealing with the removal of thereproductive organs of intersex children, a look to other jurisdictions mayprovide insight on how the Supreme Court of the United States might approachsuch a case. The Court has shown some willingness to consider foreign law whendetermining which activities constitute fundamental rights requiringConstitutional protection.'\" Both the United Kingdom and Australia haveconsidered the issue of sterilizing minor children, and both nations have a similarjurisprudential foundation and Anglo-American concept of fundamental rights.While foreign judgments are never dispositive, the Supreme Court would likelyafford them considerable weight.(2009); (2) an investigation and written report from the regional center for the developmentally disabled, id. §1955(a); (3) two examinations of the conservatee, including one by a psychologist or clinical social worker, id.§ 1955(b); (4) the examiners should only recommend sterilization if there is no suitable alternative, id. §1955(c); (5) the presence of the conservatee is required at the hearing except for \"medical inability\" or ifattending the hearing is likely to cause \"serious and immediate physiological damage\" to the conservatee, id. §1956; (6) a written decision by the judge; (7) an automatic appeal if sterilization is authorized, id. § 1962(a); (8)the appeal has automatic precedence over \"over other cases in the court in which the appeal is pending,\" id. §1962(b); (9) a stay on the procedure until the order is upheld on appeal, id. § 1962(b); and (10) an automaticexpiration date for the court order, after which a new approval must be secured if the procedure is delayed forwhatever reason, id. § 1965.152.

Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 830, 831 n.31 (2002), which foundthe laws of other Anglo-American nations worth considering.

Because thesecountries recognize a right to procreation and bodily integrity similar to thoserecognized by the United States Supreme Court, United States courts wouldlikely come to a similar conclusion if faced with similar facts.VII. ARGUMENTAs with individuals with mental disabilities, surgeries that remove thereproductive organs of children with DSDs impact several of their fundamentalliberties. Therefore, due process procedural protections are likely necessaryunder the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.To date, there are no known cases in the United States of litigation to preventthe \"gender normalization surgery\" of a child with a DSD, or of an adultlitigating over childhood harms. However, there is a growing community ofintersex individuals seeking answers and apologies for the \"medical treatments\"169. Id. at 232.170. For example, reduced sexual function and sensitivity.

The judicial treatment of the sterilization ofindividuals with mental disabilities may be particularly appropriate foranticipating how a court would reason through a case with an intersex child. Eachstate has approached this issue differently-some with legislation, some withcase law. Because California has a more formal system than many states,consisting both of statutes and case law, it is a good place to look for analternative method for regulating the sterilization of intersex children.Sterilization is the permanent removal of the reproductive organs. Ratherthan make arbitrary distinctions without any medical training, this Commentargues that doctors should avoid the removal of any reproductive organ, becausethe permanent removal of reproductive potential implicates fundamental rights.The fertility of children with DSDs is particularly difficult to define because theirbodies may have both male and female reproductive organs, either of them, orthey may lack them altogether. In some cases, the children may be assuredlyinfertile or assuredly fertile with functioning reproductive organs. However,many children fall somewhere in between.\"' A child with limited or unexpectedreproductive organs may be able to procreate with the assistance of current orfuture medical technology, but no one can predict what medical technology willbe available in twenty or thirty years, precisely at the age when these childrenwill likely seek to have children of their own.'7 ' Therefore, sterilization, not theremoval of fertility, should be the standard.Although it is possible for any child with a DSD to be infertile, someconditions have higher probabilities of infertility. For instance, female childrenwith Swyer Syndrome are infertile because they are born without any functionalgonads.'77 On the other end of the scale, children diagnosed with mircopenis174. One such practice is medical display, which many liken to sexual abuse. During medical display,intersex children are placed on exhibit for medical students. Ehrenreich & Barr, supra note 63, at 105-10.175. Determining when and if a child is fertile is beyond the scope of this Comment, but \"fertility\" is notthe issue; sterilization is. Further, it is beyond the scope of this Comment to determine which situations meritcourt intervention. While a variety of medical conditions exist, it is possible to generalize about many of themost common conditions. Doing so will allow courts to develop a framework to provide guidance in instanceswhere more unusual conditions are presented.176. For instance, children born with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) have either undescended orpartially descended testes. Future medical advances may allow for these testes to be fertile. Currently, childrenwith AIS are considered infertile, however future medical advances may allow these testes to become fertile.Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, http://www.isna.org/faq/conditions/ais (last visited Mar. 29, 2010) (on filewith the McGeorge Law Review). As another example, children with Turner's Syndrome have non-functioningovaries but a normal uterus and vagina. These women are able to have a normal pregnancy and vaginalchildbirth with a donated egg, but related cardiac issues may counsel against pregnancy.

California lawrequires that a probate court take several steps before the court can approve aprocedure that will result in sterilization, '8 presumably in order to protect (1) thepatient's right to bodily integrity, (2) the patient's right to privacy, (3) the178.

G.R.H., 325 N.E.2d 501(Ind. 1975) (finding that the common law does not authorize a parent to sterilize her brain-damaged child); In reM.K.R., 515 S.W.2d 467 (Mo. 1974) (finding that even the courts did not have jurisdiction to approve aparent's request to sterilize a child with mental disabilities without express statutory approval); Ruby v. Massey,452 F. Supp. 361, 366 (D. Conn. 1978) (finding that parents \"may neither veto nor give valid consent to thesterilization of their children\"); In re Guardianship of Hayes, 608 P.2d 635 (Wash. 1980) (finding that a parentcannot consent to the sterilization of a child with mental disabilities and that there is a \"heavy presumption\"against sterilization); and In re Moe, 432 N.E.2d 712 (Mass. 1982) (finding that individuals with mentaldisabilities enjoy the same constitutional right to privacy and procreation as any other individual; however, thisfinding allowed the court jurisdiction to entertain parental requests for the sterilization of their children).182.

Id.8672011 /Reproductive Organs and Differences of Sex Developmentpatient's right to procreate, and (4) the patient's right to autonomy. Children withDSDs have substantially similar constitutional concerns, and a substantiallysimilar process is likely to protect those concerns as it has for decades in thementally disabled community.A. The Sterilization of Children with DSDs Raises the Same Policy Concerns asthe Sterilization of the Mentally Disabled1. The Fundamental Right to Procreate and Other Constitutional ConcernsLike individuals with mental disabilities, children with DSDs should, at aminimum, enjoy procedural due process protections before having theirreproductive organs removed without their personal consent. However,procedural protections alone may not be sufficient to pass due process muster.British and Colombian courts have found that parents cannot consent to theremoval of a child's reproductive organs, even with judicial approval.'8 6Similarly, American courts may find that these children's fundamental rights areso important that even procedural protections cannot justify allowing substitutedconsent when the child may one day be capable of consent personally. \"If theright [to procreate] means anything, it is the right of the individual, married orsingle to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters sofundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget achild.\" 8 7 However, this proposal suggests governmental intrusion into the parent-child relationship, where courts have presumed that a parent acts in the bestinterest of the child. On the other hand, courts have been hesitant about a parent'sability to consider the child's best interest when the child's reproductive interestsare on the line.\"'The latent right to procreate should be judicially protected on behalf of thechild and the interest in protecting his or her autonomy in making personaldecisions in the future. \"Children are not legally capable of defending their own185. The sterilization issue is hotly debated in the mentally disabled community. See, e.g., James C.Dugan, Note, The Conflict Between \"Disabling\" and \"Enabling\" Paradigms in Law: Sterilization, theDevelopmentally Disabled, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 78 CORNELL L. REV. 507 (1993)(arguing that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 should mandate \"maximally protective sterilizationstatutes\"); Elizabeth S. Scott, Sterilization of Mentally Retarded Persons: Reproductive Rights and FamilyPrivacy, 1986 DUKE L.J. 806 (1986) (arguing against the traditional and paternalistic model of sterilization lawas applied to the mentally disabled); Maura McIntyre, Note, Buck v.

The Inability to ConsentCalifornia law expressly requires that the patient's inability to consent to amedical procedure must be permanent in order for him or her to forfeit thatright,'\" which is almost never the case with the average DSD patient. While thelegislative goal was not spelled out, one could presume that this law was createdto allow a person with disabilities to delay a personal reproductive decision ifthere is any chance that individual will eventually develop the capacity to decidepersonally. Once it is determined that the individual will not gain capacity, theindividual will receive little benefit from delaying a procedure deemedbeneficial. In other words, parental or surrogate consent will be required for theprocedure either now or later, so why delay? In the DSD context, when the childpresumptively will gain capacity through the natural aging process, there is achoice between surrogate consent and the individual's personal consent.Therefore, it is likely that courts and legislatures would prefer to delaysterilizations in cases when a child may eventually be capable of consenting tothe procedure.3. Whether the Parents Have the Best Interests of the Child in MindNo one wants to question the perceptions or motives of a parent. However, indifficult medical situations, parents may not always be capable of consideringtheir child's needs before their own.'9 ' While this may be a rare situation, societyshould be willing to inconvenience the many to protect such a fundamental rightof the few when a child's fundamental rights are involved. There is no way toascertain the unspoken thought process and emotional reactions of parents duringa doctor's procurement of consent, but all children with DSDs will benefit fromthe due process protections of a judicial hearing process.Like the Colombian Constitutional Court, some American scholars andpractitioners question the ability of parents to make the decision to pursue sexorgan surgery to treat a child with a DSD.192 One scholar, Anne Tamar-Mattis,189. Feinberg, supra note 121, at 128.190. CAL. PROB. CODE § 1958(a) (2009).191. See, e.g., Guardianship of Phillip B., 188 Cal. Rptr. 781 (1st Dist. 1983) (finding that emotionallydetached parents are not in the best position to protect the best interests of the child).192. See Tamar-Mattis, Exceptions to the Rule, supra note 18, at 89-90 (arguing for the adoption of ajudicial hearing for any genital surgery on a child unable to consent). Tamar-Mattis defines parental \"conflict ofinterest\" by noting that \"parents may be responding to multiple conscious or unconscious needs-the child's,their own, other people's-that may make it confusing and difficult to weigh all aspects of this decisionobjectively. This very confusion and pressure may make it tempting to opt for, and believe in, the 'magic wand'8692011/Reproductive Organs and Differences of Sex Developmentprimarily focuses on fulfilling the psychological needs of the parents and arguesthat \"the decision to perform surgery may be centered more around the needs ofcaregivers than the needs of the child.\"' 3 Tamar-Mattis highlights an importantcontradiction: the foundation of the surgical treatment model is that the parentswill be alienated from a \"different\" child until and unless the surgery isperformed.'\" However, potential parental alienation is the precise reason thatmany courts doubt the parents' ability to consider the best interests of a healthychild's organ donation or the purposeful sterilization of a mentally disabledchild.'95 Parents may also have difficulty protecting a child's future procreativeability because of the discomfort of imagining their child as an adult with sexualneeds.'\" Because of these concerns, the most important procedural protection forchildren in the judicial hearing process is the appointment of a guardian ad litemwho must presume that the child would oppose the procedure. Without suchrepresentation, the court could become a rubber stamp to a decision made by theparent and doctors without meaningful neutral consideration.\"'B. The Inability to Reinterpret the Existing Laws Governing the Sterilization ofIndividuals with Mental Disabilities to Extend the Protections to IntersexChildrenIt would be difficult to simply reinterpret existing law to apply to childrenwith DSDs because current law contemplates that the mentally disabled arepermanently unable to consent. Put simply, if a state regulates the sterilization ofthe mentally disabled, its laws are usually expressly limited to that portion of thepopulation and to medical treatments with the primary purpose of sterilization.However, it is possible to read the statutes more broadly as recognizing thatprocreation is a fundamental right and as a result, the permanent removal offertility is an extraordinary procedure that falls outside the scope of theparental/surrogate consent presumptions.of surgery, so they can get on with loving and nurturing their baby.\" Id. at 89 n.216.193. Id. at 89.194. Id. at 89-90.195. Id. See supra note 188 and accompanying text (describing the parents' potential conflict of interestthat could cloud their ability to make treatment decisions for a child with a DSD).196. Tamar-Mattis, Exceptions to the Rule, supra note 18, at 83-84 (\"Parents may be hampered inmaking decisions that affect their child's adult sexual life because they may be uncomfortable thinking aboutthe child as a sexual or potentially sexual being.\").197. Id. at 104 (\"As in the case of child sterilization or organ donations, this representative should becharged with arguing vigorously against the proposed surgery in order to assure a meaningful adversarialprocess.\").870McGeorge Law Review / Vol. 42In the DSD context, sterilization is rarely the stated purpose of surgery.'However, the procedures do necessarily sterilize the child by removing his or herreproductive organs.C. Why Judicial Review Is Better than Parental Informed ConsentThe judicial hearing process protects children by ensuring that theirreproductive organs are removed only when a neutral decision-maker confirmsthat it is in their best interest. While surgeries without the child's personalconsent may qualify as child abuse in the most literal sense, \" \"the interventionsare presumed to be in the children's best interests because parents and doctors areinvolved.\" 20 However, removing a child's reproductive organs can have far-reaching effects on the child's adulthood. As noted by Tamar-Mattis, allowingthe informed consent model to continue would \"carry the implication that itwould be acceptable for parents to authorize the surgery for any reason-parental discomfort, embarrassment over raising a son with a small penis or adaughter with a noticeable clitoris, desire for one gender or another-as long asthey were fully informed of the risks.\"20 1 Many of the potential reasons behind aparent's informed consent to DSD treatment do not outweigh the child'sfundamental rights, and the judicial hearing process provides the properprocedural and substantive protections to assure that those rights are safeguarded.As. noted by the Colombian Constitutional Court, parents may be unknowinglyacting upon their own fears or intolerance.2 02VIII. CONCLUSIONSurgery to remove a child's reproductive organs currently affects his or herfundamental rights without independent representation of what the child mightwant if he or she were able to consent. This type of unilateral and fundamentalinvasion of a child's bodily integrity is offensive to the American notion of due198. See supra note 176 and accompanying text and Introduction (\"Whether or not these surgeons intendto do so, they are, in effect, sterilizing the child when they elect to remove his or her reproductive organs. Thiselection should be considered independently of the child's actual or predicted fertility.\").199.
