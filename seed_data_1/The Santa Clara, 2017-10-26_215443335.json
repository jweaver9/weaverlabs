It was also an opportunity for redemption. Leanna began singing as a child in her school choir and has carried her passion for music with her through college. She first per-formed in Love Jones Café (an earlier, smaller-scale version of the event we know today) during her first year at Santa Clara. Since then, she has participated in Love Jones every year. This particular performance carried a high level of personal significance for Leanna, as she took a second chance with a song she had previously struggled with. In her freshman year of high school, she was asked to sing “Back to Black” at a graduation party for a friend of hers. Upon reaching the stage, Leanna recalls that she “immediately forgot all the lyrics.” For Leanna, this Love Jones was more than just another performance—it was her chance to do what she couldn’t so many years ago. Love Jones is a stunning showcase of stu-dent talent at Santa Clara, interspersed with some truly moving performances. This event is hosted each quarter by Santa Clara’s own Igwebuike, a multicultural club at Santa Clara whose mission is, according to their Facebook page, “to celebrate and empower black stu-dents through educational, social and cultural programming.” The talent show is open to all students at Santa Clara, providing a space where students can exhibit any and all talents to their peers without fear of judgement. Love Jones began 15 years ago as a poetry-based show in the basement of Benson. Since then, it has blos-somed to become an all-inclusive illustration of the variety of talents found at Santa Clara.When Oct. 19 rolled around, I made my way over to Locatelli with a few friends. When we arrived, the room was dark and filling with the chatter of expectant students. We walked in behind the oversized fur coats of the event hosts, Ibhade Ologbosele and Alonzo Billips (taking up the roles of musicians Cardi B and Offset, respectively). While my group made our way to stand in the back of the crowded room, the hosts swag-gered up to the stage, moving to the beat of a pulsing 808 and energizing the room. After a brief introduction and a short dance to “Bad and Boujee,” the show began.The night started off with a performance by Carmel Paradise. She performed an original piece called “Battleground.” The song was moving, energetic and deeply emotional.Shake it Out in an EmergencyUniversity hosts campus-wide event dedicated to safety Emma PollansAssociate ReporterAt 10:19 a.m. last Thursday, Campus Safety sent out an alert to to students, fac-ulty and staff asking everyone to voluntarily drop, cover and hold; simulating a two min-ute earthquake. This was for the university’s first annual Public Safety Awareness Day, with the goal to educate students on what to do in case of an emergency. The Oct. 19 event coincided with the Great ShakeOut, an annual earthquake drill organized throughout California. Afterwards at the Alameda Mall, several local public safety and university groups were set up to educate students about being prepared for emergencies. The organiza-tions included Santa Clara’s EMTs and En-vironmental Health Department. Overall, the event allowed for the campus communi-ty to take steps toward being better prepared for various emergency situations.Don Mattei, Emer-gency Planning Man-ager for Campus Safety Services and coordina-tor of this annual event, said he will continue to have Public Safety Awareness Day and the Great ShakeOut coincide in coming years and plans to ramp up the experience. “Some departments have or are in the process of working on evacuation proce-dures,” Mattei said. “Eventually, the goal will be to have a complete evacuation of all campus buildings at the same time.” According to Mattei, this drill could be anywhere from three to five years away.He also discussed the importance of students being prepared in case of an emergency. “Students should have a ‘go’ bag with a cell phone charger, food, blankets, contact info, extra batteries and someone local they can reach out to if the uni-versity had to be evacu-ated,” Mattei said. Another goal of Mat-tei’s is to build up inter-est for a Campus Emer-gency Response Team (CERT). The CERT program would consist of vol-unteer students ready to help out in any emergency scenarios. The team would be trained by various groups from the city of Santa Clara and would be able to assist with situations in the surrounding community. “It would be a good learning road for students interested in law enforcement, fire, emergency management,” Mattei said.Contact Emma Pollans  at epollans@scu.edu or call (408) 554-4852.A Tale of Talent and RedemptionSee LOVE JONES, Page 4Since 1922  www.thesantaclara.org @thesantaclara @thesantaclara One free copyA private tastingat a teriyaki cafe4 SCENE 6 OPINIONTwo views onkneeling in the NFLMen’s Basketballpreview 8 SPORTSKEVIN BOEHNLEIN FOR THE SANTA CLARAThe Oct. 19 event coincided with the Great ShakeOut, an annual earthquake drillWRITING FORWARD READING SERIES: On Oct. 19, author VIet Thanh Nguyen read excerpts from his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “The Sympathizer.”The crowded event, held in the de Saisset Museum, was put on by the Santa Clara Review and the English Department’s Creative Writing Program.2 / News The Santa Clara  Thursday, October 26, 2017 Since 1922 • • •Volume 97, Issue 5• • •EDITOR-IN-CHIEFJimmy FlynnMANAGING EDITORPerla LunaEDITORSNews: Erin FoxOpinion: Perla Luna Scene: Sarah TarterSports: Olivia DeGracaPhoto: Michelle WangHead Copy: Kali SwindellDesign:  Mimi NajmabadiREPORTERSKimi AndrewAddy CamisaJay FuchsMeghan McLaughlinJay MehtaNoah SonnenburgAlex StewartCOPY DESKBronwyn GeyerEmily MunDESIGN DESKMimi NajmabadiPHOTOGRAPHERSAlyssa Lee Kevin NgoCesar TesenAndrea YunADVERTISING MANAGERHannah HawkinsFINANCE MANAGERJames KipperWEB ENGINEERMatt KordonskyDISTRIBUTION MANAGERMaritza SoriaADVISERSGordon YoungCharles Barry, photoDan McSweeney, photoCONTACT USNewsroom:  (408) 554-4852Editor-in-chief: (408) 554-4849Advertising: (408) 554-4445ON THE WEBwww.thesantaclara.orgEMAILeditor@thesantaclara.orgEditors and departments can also be reached via email at section@thesantaclara.org (e.g. sports@thesantaclara.org).

Email news@thesantaclara.org.Ellen Knick-meyerAssociated PressSANTA ROSA, Calif. — Government of-ficials outlined plans Monday for what they say will be the largest fire clean-up in Cali-fornia history, aimed at removing hazard-ous substances and ash from 8,400 homes and other structures burned in Northern California wildfires.With hundreds of anxious homeowners listening, state emer-gency services official Eric Lamoureux set a target of early 2018 for completing the clean-up and allowing own-ers to start rebuilding.California has de-clared a public health emergency in the fire area, in part because of concern for hazard-ous substances ranging from freon in air-con-ditioners to asbestos in older homes.The fires that began Oct. 8 have killed at least 42 people, mak-ing them the deadliest series of wildfires in state history. “The size and scope of this debris removal process will be one for the record books,” Sen. Mike McGuire, a Democrat from the wine-country town of Healdsburg, told fire survivors at a Santa Rosa community fo-rum. The meeting gave residents some of the first briefings on the clean-up to come.Authorities have warned residents re-turning to the ruins of their homes to beware of possible hazardous residues in the ashes, and required them to sign forms acknowl-edging the danger.Many survivors at Monday’s forum, and in fire zones where people are returning, say they are confused about what authorities will allow them to do at their blackened prop-erties before the mas-sive waste removal.“How do you get your mourning start-ed if I can’t stop and put hands on the scat-tering of possessions left?” asked resident Joyce Farinato, who wore gardening gloves and a mask Monday as she walked through the chunks of concrete and bent metal that were all that was left of her home in rural Sonoma County.“I’d like to know what’s hazardous. What are we looking for?” Farinato said.In Santa Rosa, authorities with the Federal Emergency Management Admin-istration and the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-neers joined local and state officials answer-ing other questions from homeowners.In two of the hard-est-hit areas, Sonoma and Napa, the U.S. Environmental Pro-tection Agency will be the agency that moves first, removing any hazardous materials from the thousands of sites, officials said Monday. State agen-cies would handle the same task in five other burned counties. The EPA effort would start this week, said Lamoureux, of California’s Office of Emergency Services.Hundreds of teams led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are to move in next, re-moving ash and rubble.In Sonoma Coun-ty, the scene of the most destruction and deaths, county offi-cials will draft envi-ronmental standards to be followed by any homeowners who opt to handle the clean-up themselves, at their own expense, officials said. For property own-ers who let the gov-ernment handle the clean-up, taxpayers will cover any of the costs of debris removal that insurance doesn’t, Lamoureux said.Authorities have yet to put a price tag on the process.Officials promised more town meetings. Homeowners said that was a good idea.Global • President Xi Jinping of China unveiled a leadership team on Wednesday with five new members all in their 60s.

The debate on whether to allow any outside sources to record ASG meetings continued and did not conclude with a vote. Tedd Vanadilok, the ASG Center for Student Leadership Staff Advisor, made a short presentation on the questions he brought to the general counsel, who essentially act as the university’s lawyers.These questions did not give senators new information, as Vanadilok had not received any response to them at that point.Sophomore Senator Duncan McDonell asked if the votes made by ASG members would be filmed by media services. Vanadilok suspected those votes would be recorded, but without confirmation from a licensed attorney, there was no way to completely answer questions.Senate Chair Aly Motzel claimed that from the previous discussions, it had been decided that through the remainder of the academic year, no recordings would be allowed at ASG meetings. However, no unanimous decision was made on the matter.Multiple senators spoke up and many agreed a vote on this decision would be justified, rather than a few central people to ASG making a major decision on the senators’ behalf. A commendation in the name of Jay Bassett, a recent alumni who passed away the week prior, was made and presented to ASG by Vice President Sam Pérez and ASG Associate Justice Grace Zimmerman.Bassett was commended for their “oustanding contributions to the Santa Clara University campus community for the betterment of the lives of the students” and “unwavering devotion to confronting stigmas” regarding mental health and the LGBTQ+ students.President Jack Herstam encouraged senators to continue inquir-ing about the Sustaining Excellence Project to help improve upon it. The ASG Senate will meet again during week six on Thursday at 7 p.m. in the Williman Room in Benson.Contact Meghan McLaughlin at mmclaughlin@scu.edu or call (408) 554-4852.POWER\tSYSTEMS\tAND\tSUSTAINABLE\tENERGY\tPROGRAM\tAT\tSANTA\tCLARA\tUNIVERSITY\tThis\torganization\t brings\ttogether\t a\tmulti-disciplinary\t group\tof\tindividuals\twho\tshare\ta\tmutual\t interest\t in\ttackling\t the\tglobal\tproblems\t related\t to\tthe\tconsumption\tof\tenergy.\tA\tforum\tfor\tstudents,\talumni,\tand\tfaculty\tat\tSanta\tClara\tUniversity\t to\tcollaborate\t and\tnetwork\twith\tone\tanother.\tWe\thost\tspeaker\tevents,\tworkshops,\tand\tfield\t trips\t to\tcomplement\t the\tacademic\t curriculum.Thursday\tNovember\t16th - 5-7pm:Weigand 102,\tVari HallGuest\tSpeaker\tand\tSCU\tAlumni:Martin\tPrado\tfrom\tEPRIRSVP:\tscuenergyclub@gmail.comUpcoming\tEventRenewable\tenergy\tis\tthe\tfastest-growing\tsector\tin\tCalifornia,\tand\tSilicon\tValley\tis\thome\tto\tthe\tworld’s\tlargest\tcluster\tof\tthese\tcompanies\tand\tgreen\tinvestors,\toffering\ttremendous\tcareer\topportunities.Twenty-first\tcentury\tproblems\tdemand\tholistic\tthinking\tto\teffectively\taddress\tthe\tsocial,\tenvironmental,\tand\teconomic\timpact\tof\temerging\tenergy\ttechnologies.\tSanta\tClara\tUniversity\toffers\tgraduate\tCertificate\tin\tRenewable\tEnergy\tand\tmulti-disciplinary\tMaster’s\tdegree\tin\tPower\tSystems\tand\tSustainable\tEnergy.Fuel\tyour\tpassion\tfor\tenergy\tengineering\tas\tyou\ttrain\talongside\tSilicon\tValley\tprofessionals\tto\tmeet\tthe\tchanging\tdemands\tin\tenergy\tand\tfulfill\ta\tpressing\tneed\tin\tthe\trapidly\tgrowing\trenewable\tenergy\tmarket\tin\tour\tValley\tand\tin\tthe\tworld.Application\t and\tAdmission\t deadlines:https://www.scu.edu/engineering/graduate/admissions-deadlines/Contact:\tDr.\tMaryam\tKhanbaghi,\t Program\tDirectorEmail:\tmkhanbaghi@scu.eduSCU\tEnergy\tClubAlumni was an advocate, ally, leaderErin FoxNews EditorRecent university gradu-ate Jay Bassett passed away on Oct. 12, 2017. Originally from Los Gatos, Jay majored in business management with a minor in women’s and gen-der studies (WGST) and was active in ROTC and the LG-BTQ+ community on campus.“Let us also remember the LGBTQ+ community and oth-er marginalized communities that have lost an advocate in Jay,” University President Michael Engh, S.J. said in a campus-wide email. “Jay was passionate about ensuring the dignity of our LGBTQ+ mem-bers, generously supported the Rainbow Resource Cen-ter as a student leader, and co-founded a campus chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.”A commendation in the name of Bassett was present-ed to the Associated Student Government (ASG) Senate during their week five meet-ing by Vice President Sam Pérez and ASG Associate Justice Grace Zimmerman. Bassett was commended for their work at the Rainbow Resource Center and their commitment to the LBGTQ community.An example of such is how Bassett was instrumental in the inception of a LGBTQ+ Endowed Scholarship Fund established earlier this sum-mer. The fund will be con-tinually supported by the university and donations. The fund is intended to provide financial support for projects to those with financial need in the LGBTQ+ community interested in pursuing an education at Santa Clara.“Jay had so much pas-sion, intention and meaning behind everything they said and did,” said assistant di-rector of Student and Young Alumni Giving Frankie Bas-tone. “On the Day of Giving this past March, Jay gave back supporting LGBTQ+ students at Santa Clara. Although the LGBTQ+ Endowed Scholar-ship was not 100 percent in creation yet, Jay gave to the Rainbow Resource Center Fund for Inclusivity. Over the summer the Endowed Schol-arship came into existence and the first person I wanted to share the news with was Jay, who was so passionate and close to its progress.” Bassett also served as a delegation from Santa Clara at the IgnationQ Conference in 2015 hosted by Georgetown University.  Not only was Bassett an LGBTQ+ advocate, but also a fierce ally on a wide range of other issues spanning ra-cial and gender justice, both within the Santa Clara com-munity and beyond.“Jay consistently offered a powerful voice and perspec-tive within these learning spaces,” said an email sent from the Women’s and Gen-der Studies (WGST) depart-ment to current students and alumni. The department plans to organize a future gathering to “celebrate Jay’s life and invaluable contribu-tions” to the WGST commu-nity.“Jay was really bright and creative. They were an ad-vocate for lots of people and definitely a feminist. In class and out, they wanted to un-derstand things about diver-sity and equality for people,” said Linda Garber, associate professor and WGST depart-ment chair. WGST assistant professor Sonja Mackenzie never had Bassett as a student, but said she got to know them through involvement in the LGBTQ+ ad-hoc task force comprised of faculty, staff and students formed in response to acts of discrimination on campus last fall.  “Jay was a real leader in bringing people together al-ways and making sure that student voices were present,” Mackenzie said. “Jay brought this incredible spark and en-ergy for building community, recognizing issues and acting on them in a way that did so much for so many people on campus.” Bassett was also a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the hon-or society of Jesuit colleges and universities; Beta Gam-ma Sigma, an international honor society serving AAC-SB International accredited business programs and Iota Iota Iota, a national women’s studies honor society.They were on the Dean’s List, a member of the Santa Clara Honors Program, Air Force Reserve Officer Train-ing Corps, a Peer Health Edu-cator as well as a Peer Facili-tator through the Office of Multicultural Learning.A candlelight vigil was held in Bassett’s memory on Oct. 15 in front of the Mis-sion Church, followed by the 9 p.m. Sunday liturgy.Bassett was also active in the marching band and dra-ma program at Leigh High School, where they graduated in 2013. Bassett also earned the rank of Eagle Scout within the Boy Scouts of America. Bassett is survived by their parents, Kathy and Scott, and sisters Katie and Wendy.A memorial service is be-ing planned by the family in early November and is work-ing with the university on a foundation in Bassett’s name for mental health services on campus.

ASG Recap: Week FiveSCENEThursday, October 26, 20174Her warm, heartfelt voice gave everyone in the room pause as the show began, setting a tone for the following acts. Later, the Santa Clara Gospel Choir took the stage. Without amplification, they sang a rendi-tion of the Catholic hymn “Gath-er Your People.” From the back, the audience visibly bobbed and responded to each note.One of the most impressive acts of the night was the dance put on by “Seen Yo Staff.” In per-fect synchrony, this group of se-nior staff members cavorted for the audience for a lively couple of minutes. They danced along to a medley of songs including Sean Paul’s “Temperature,” The Talking Heads’ “Burning Down the House” and Sean Kingston’s “Fire Burning.”I was fortunate enough to sit down with both Ibhade Olog-bosele and Alonzo Billips, who hosted the evening. Both have been members of Igwebuike since their first year at Santa Clara, but this was their first time hosting Love Jones. “Love Jones is something necessary which brings us to-gether as a school community and gets Igwe[buike] out there,” Ologbosele said. Alonzo had a similar senti-ment to share about the com-munity aspect of the event. “I want to make [Love Jones] as fun for the audience members to make them receptive to all the acts,” he said. After their hosting odyssey, both commented how much more respect they have for per-formers. “Without performers, we wouldn’t have the show,” Olog-bosele said.In February, Igwebuike will be hosting another Love Jones in the spirit of Valentine’s Day.Contact Noah Sonnenburg at nasonnenburg@scu.edu or call (408) 554-4852.Resident food critic reviews a  local eateryJimmy Flynneditor-in-chiefEric Kim gracefully moves around his open kitchen—chop-ping, grilling, saucing, plating and finishing. He dons an all-black chef’s uniform and a disciplined expres-sion. He doesn’t sweat, scream or in any way lose his composure. Af-ter 20 years as a Japanese chef, the man respectfully and affectionately known as “Chef Eric” exudes what has made his restaurant and catering business so successful: passion and professionalism.On Oct. 16, a guest and I were invited to a private tasting at Chef Eric’s restaurant, Greenfish Teriyaki Cafe. Located north of campus on Lafayette Street, Greenfish Teriyaki Cafe has been around since 2015—when it replaced former tenant Ed’s Gourmet. The restaurant was established following the success of Kim’s ca-tering business—Greenfish Cater-ing—which has serviced high-profile weddings, corporate events and fundraisers around the Bay Area for over ten years. During my tasting, I spoke at length with Mina Park, the event manager for Greenfish and Chef Eric’s right-hand woman.“Our goal [with the restaurant] is to make authentic food in a short period of time,” Park said. “We make it easy to eat fast.”Park said the restaurant has struggled to make its presence felt in Santa Clara but she maintains that Chef Eric is the real deal.Thomas Ash, head of event sales and operations, agrees. Ash worked in tech for many years before being inspired by Chef Eric and his pas-sion for food. “Chef Eric doesn’t get anything delivered,” Ash said. “Anytime there’s a catering or anything, Chef Eric goes out and gets it. He does the shopping, he picks out the food.”This attention to detail is what separates Chef Eric from many local chefs. He sees Greenfish as a tradi-tional Japanese teriyaki shop that is “fast, fresh and healthy.”“It’s a small menu. We try to get orders out in five minutes or less,” Kim said. During my tasting, this was the case. The food came fast and the M.O. of Greenfish became clear: minimal options and maximum flavors.The tasting began with a sam-pling of Chef Eric’s homemade teri-yaki and sweet chili sauces. Park told me  Chef Eric’s teriyaki sauce is slow-cooked overnight for 10-12 hours, al-lowing the sweet concoction to slow-ly extract and intensify with flavor. Additionally—in an effort to make his sauce more healthy—Chef Eric forsakes adding sugars and sweeten-ers in favor of fruits and vegetables. The sauce is perhaps the best teriyaki sauce I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The consistency is rich and luscious, and the flavor is sweet, tangy and full-bodied. I defi-nitely tasted the raisin-like sweet-ness of the unique sauce. The sweet chili sauce—though not as complex and labor-inten-sive—is equally as memorable. Leaning more chili that sweet, the red-colored sauce is assertive, but not overwhelming. Of course, both of these sauces reach their fullest potential when laid on top of Chef Eric’s teriyaki chicken—tender, juicy and charred to perfection. At Greenfish, the teri-yaki chicken plate comes with sides of white rice, broccoli and coleslaw—all for $8.45. Customers also have the option of ordering teriyaki beef ($9.45) or a combination of beef and chicken ($10.45). Vegetarians and vegans, on the other hand, might have to compromise their beliefs or seek Japanese food elsewhere. Chef Eric also prepares chicken in the form of chicken katsu—lightly breaded and topped with a ketchup-based katsu sauce. Like the teriyaki chicken, the chicken katsu comes served with rice, broccoli and cole-slaw. For me, the chicken katsu rivaled Chef Eric’s chicken teriyaki. Though fried, the katsu was not overly greasy or heavy. It was intensely delicious.The final dish I sampled was something called a teri-cheese beef sandwich—Eric’s Japanese-influ-enced take on a traditional Philly cheesesteak. The sandwich fills a soft roll of bread with sweet teriyaki beef, grilled mushrooms and onions, melty jack cheese and mayonnaise. The dish’s texture and flavor profile reminded me of a Chinese pork bao in that it boldly blended sweet, sa-vory, saucy meat with a soft, doughy exterior. The sandwich was rich, indulgent and highly-addicting. If you don’t mind extending your workout that day, the teri-cheese beef is infinitely recommendable.Chef Eric, in an effort to extend his modest menu, told me he plans to add bento boxes in the near future. Park also said that the restaurant has discussed working with delivery services like UberEats in hopes of reaching a wider clientele. Though the young Greenfish Teriyaki Cafe may not look like much with its unfinished decor, wooden tables and humble plastic chairs, the food is worth it. Chef Eric and Co. are proven, passionate professionals with ex-tensive experience and high hopes. They treated me with the utmost love and respect—as they seem to do with every customer that walks through the door.As I left, I glanced back into the kitchen. Following my tasting and our chat, Chef Eric returned to doing what he does best—chopping, grill-ing, saucing, plating and finishing. That passion and professionalism isn’t going anywhere.

No, these aren’t the torture chambers of some maniacal scientist—they are the works of Body Worlds, an organi-zation in the business of preserving human specimen for educational purposes. The Body Worlds Decoded exhibit at the Tech Museum of In-novation opened Oct. 15 with the mission of teaching its visitors about human anatomy. The faint of heart need not worry about viewing the exhibit, as careful consideration went into its creation. The walls are curved to block visitors from accidentally stumbling onto the unwelcome sight of a fleshy hu-man posed to look like a baseball player mid-bat. However, the specimen are not generally gruesome sights. I didn’t even realize they were real human bodies until it was explicitly pointed out to me. Knowledge of this ma-teriality does make them take on an extra visceral quality, but it’s the kind of feeling you get when you see an accident on the freeway. You just can’t look away. The featured bodies underwent a process called “plastination,” a unique process that replaces bodily fluids and soluble fats with fluid plas-tics in order to ensure their preser-vation. The lifelike poses the bodies are fixed into before being hardened demonstrate how the human body responds internally to movements in everyday life. As you walk through the museum, you can see the mus-cles being used by an opera singer, a boxer and even what happens to lungs after smoking. “Having a good mix of specimens was important,” Exhibit Content De-signer Lisa Incatasciato said. “There was that balance of is this too shock-ing versus does this spark conversa-tion or show what we want to show anatomically.”Some may have ethical qualms about the use of human bodies in an exhibit like this. But rest assured, this is not some sketchy carnival show. Santa Clara’s own Markkula Center for Applied Ethics played a hand in answering ethical questions for the San Jose exhibit. The top pri-ority for everyone involved in the planning process was to create an exhibit that would be physically and cognitively accessible for everyone. This is how the augmented re-ality (AR) comes into play. Using “Iris,” the Tech Museum’s custom AR system, visitors can literally step inside a heart or an eyeball. When you first check into the exhibit, you’ll receive a handheld device that’ll guide you through various points of interest. It’s sort of like Pokemon Go, but instead of catching Pikachu you get to examine internal organs and systems. Which, arguably, is way cooler than Pokemon Go. Those who’d prefer to go without the AR element can still enjoy a full experience. But the AR adds an im-mersive level of context to the whole experience that’s hard to beat. “It’ll be really interesting to see how people respond to the AR and how they use it,” Incatasciato said. “Hopefully we can be a test bed for AR developers who can come and see how the public reacts to it.” There will be plenty of chances to make your way over to the Tech Museum for this unique experience. The exhibit is expected to complete a 10-year run, an unprecedented com-mitment for both Body Worlds (a traveling exhibit) and the Tech Mu-seum. Expect to make multiple trips back to the museum as the specimen are switched out to highlight differ-ent aspects of human anatomy.“The pieces themselves were chosen aesthetically and for what they can show you about body sys-tems,” Incatasciato said. “Even if you’re not interested in anatomy, by the time you leave you’ll see there’s something here for everyone.” Contact Perla Luna at pluna@scu.edu or call (408) 554-4852.PHOTO COURTESY OF SCU.EDUBut rest assured, this is not some sketchy carnival show.A mixed review for SCU Presents’ Fall One-Act FestivalEthan Bebernessassociate reporterSanta Clara’s Department of The-atre and Dance left audiences both cringing and laughing during the 2017 Fall One-Act Festival, which took place from Oct. 21-22.The featured plays included “Three More Sleepless Nights,” writ-ten by Caryl Churchill and directed by junior Lee Harrold, and “Wanda’s Visit,” written by Christopher Du-rang and directed by senior Hunter Donovan. “Three More Sleepless Nights”With “Three More Sleepless Nights,” Lee Harrold set out to ex-plore how we approach blame and responsibility for our own actions and the actions of others. In a note included in the playbill, Harrold asks the audience, “What would you ad-mit responsibility for?”While his imagined purpose is a profound and interesting concept, the execution of that concept leaves much to be desired. Less than five minutes into the play, I was thrown off by the use of British English vernacular (i.e.“row” as in “argument,” “pissed” as in “drunk,” etc.)—even though the ac-tors maintained American accents. First-year Rita Kelly, playing Margaret—an insecure, longtime housewife trying to find purpose through a new career path—made an initial attempt at an accent, but her voice eventually devolved into her natural Southern drawl rather than the Cockney accent her vocabulary required. The acting in general was bland and unconvincing, causing the per-formance to feel reminiscent of a class skit rather than a well-re-hearsed play. A feeling of noncom-mittal uneasiness lingered in the air as the actors moved across the stage and under the sheets, milking the comedic moments for far too long and downplaying the playwright’s intended dramatic moments. The play’s set was its primary redeeming quality, utilizing a stage of just a bed, a table and a mirror to its full potential. The story was told through three vignettes of couples in bed working through their trou-bled lives. By using an actual bedside lamp rather than relying on just the overhead lighting, the actors were able to physically control the mood of their scene by flicking the switch. “Three More Sleepless Nights” was a great idea held back by poor execution. Harrold made an attempt at touching something profound, but was unable to do so. “Wanda’s Visit”In her directorial debut, Hunter Donovan takes the audience on a whirlwind journey when a normal New England couple, Jim and Mar-sha, are visited by Jim’s high school girlfriend, Wanda.In an interview, Donovan dis-cussed her selection of the piece. “There is a joke on every page,” she said. “It kind of hits you over the head, which is what I wanted.” Leading that comedic conquest is senior Annick Gerard playing Wanda, the namesake of the play and the driving plot force. Wanda barges into Jim and Marsha’s life, played by junior Vikram Naidu and first-year Lucy Gilbert, respectively. Wanda constantly stuns and horri-fies with her life tales since she and Jim split up. Her antics keep the audience on their toes, completely unable to guess just what she’ll do next. Ge-rard relished in the audience laughs while maintaining character as she swung from one emotional high to another. One minute she was sobbing and proclaiming her profound unhap-piness, and the next she was laugh-ing hysterically and telling Jim how much she loved Marsha’s sense of humor. Gerard’s Wanda truly car-ried the show and kept me laughing and on the edge of my seat from the moment she set foot on stage. Wanda’s visit pushes Jim and Marsha to reevaluate their lives, their happiness and their marriage. Though the play is a comedy, the audience is invited to find some-thing behind the humor—how we can learn and grow from the chaotic moments we experience. Wanda is the wild card in all our lives that forces us to, as she puts it, “roll with the punches.”Contact Ethan Beberness at ebeberness@scu.edu or call (408) 554-4852.Two Student-Directed Plays Hit the Stage New Tech Museum Exhibit Augments Human Anatomy PERLA LUNA — THE SANTA CLARA“Body Worlds Decoded” utilizes plastinated human bodies, along with augmented reality and other technologies, to provide visitors with a realistic representation of the body’s organs and systems. The exhibit is highly educational, as it provides a full-body visual-ization of bones, muscles, nervous and circulatory systems, as well as an aesthetically pleasing artistic display. The curators of the Body World’s exhibit intentionally select and pose figures in a variety of positions in order to give viewers a more well-rounded understanding of the human body. Above, a human body is posed in the posture of a flamenco dancer, in order to give visitors an accurate look at a dancer’s muscle movement. The diverse displays are part of what helps brings the exhibit to life. PERLA LUNA — THE SANTA CLARAOPINIONThursday, October 26, 20176Football was once the place where politics and divisive conversations would cease to exist for a few hours each week. Now, the National Football League has evolved into one of the most powerful social and political plat-forms in the country. From its play-ers organizing a lockout in 2011 to news of the league suppress-ing reports of a fatal concussion-linked brain disease, the NFL has no doubt been entrenched in is-sues extending far be-yond the game itself. Fans cannot seem to get away from the dra-ma now, even on days not called Thursday, Sunday or Monday. President Trump recently embarked on a Twitter cru-sade against the NFL and its personnel for failing to stand during the National Anthem. The act of kneeling dur-ing the anthem began as a lone protest against police brutality by former 49ers quar-terback Colin Kaepernick. With several big teams—and even Bellarmine College Prep down the road from us—kneeling, the process has been transformed into a sweeping symbol of defiance in the face of discrimination and Donald Trump’s presi-dency itself.What surprises me most is not the refusal to stand during the anthem, but rather the hy-pocrisy surrounding the league in general—particularly when it comes to gender issues.On Oct. 4, Cam Newton pointedly questioned the cred-ibility of a reporter simply be-cause she was a woman. When she asked him about his in-game strategy, Newton chuck-led and saying it was “funny to hear a female talk about routes.” While he himself has not actually knelt thus far, New-ton has come out in support of Kaepernick’s original message of social equality.And then there are the repeated incidents of domestic violence committed by the athletes them-selves. Ezekiel Elliot, the Dallas Cowboys’ running back, is the most recent player with charges brought against him. After being accused of domestic vio-lence more than a year ago, Elliot now faces a six-game suspension. Unfortunately, this is not an unusual scenario in the NFL. During the draft in May, six of the players selected—including one during the first round—were suspected of sexual assault or abuse.  I recognize the ignorance of a few does not de-tract from the larger issue at hand—racial injustices within the nation. A majority of these athletes do not engage in these problematic behaviors and work hard to be good role models. Many have chosen to use the stage they’ve earned to speak out for what they feel is a genuine problem. Sports have long served as a chance for dialogue from otherwise voiceless com-munities, dating back to Tommie Smith’s famous raised fist following his win at the 1968 Olympics.While some may use the bad behavior of a few as an excuse to discredit the message behind the protests, many people are genuinely insulted by players taking a knee during the anthem. Those who have lost loved ones fighting overseas could interpret it as a slap in the face. In order for such polarizing demonstrations to unite people toward a common goal, a few things need to be corrected, including the integrity of some of the athletes themselves. It’s hard to take some-one supporting the message of social inequality seriously while he simultaneously berates a female journalist for her gender. Before standing up (or rather kneeling) for an is-sue, it is the players’ responsibility to come together and recognize that their message is important, but so too is the message of others experiencing in-justices.  The players (and coaches) must also conduct themselves in a way that won’t allow anyone to discount what they’re trying to say. Yes, they are people too and will still make mistakes. But gun, sexual assault and other criminal charges will only continue reinforcing negative perceptions. Earning respect off the field will be the differ-ence between remembering “that time when NFL players knelt during the anthem” and remembering when the NFL transcended sports altogether and accomplished something on a national scale.John Brussa is a junior management major and editor of the Opinion section.   Two opinion     writers take on the NFL national anthem protestsDonald Trump has a lot on his plate. Senator Jeff Flake just announced he will not be running for re-election out of spite for Trump’s administration, the Puerto Rican power grid is still in shambles and North Korea has dem-onstrated cyber attack capabilities outstripping our worst nightmares. Naturally, the President looked for distractions. Among this week’s sideshows is his decision to revisit the NFL na-tional anthem protests: a dead horse so thoroughly beaten that it is pulp by now.     Though this month-old public discourse has been all but forgotten, the President decided he was not finished with the handful of players still opting to demonstrate during the national anthem. This past Monday, he tweeted, “Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem, showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country. No leadership in NFL!” Though the drama surrounding the National Anthem protests is con-tentious and polarizing, the issue it-self is not that nuanced. In fact, it is pretty cut and dry. When it comes down to it, there are two sides to this debate; either you believe in the First Amendment, or you believe in Donald Trump. Freedom of speech allows these players to protest however they see fit.  Becoming president does not im-bue you with the privilege of threat-ening private citizens’ employment because they do not see eye-to-eye with you ideologically. Someone who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution should know that.That is why Donald Trump is wrong about this topic, but that is not why I am writing this article. The rea-son I am writing this is because this issue should be irrelevant by now. It was phased out of the news cy-cle, and then it became exactly what it should be: a forgettable blip that will momentarily resurge when news outlets do their “year in review” seg-ments in December. It did not deserve Trump’s atten-tion in the first place and, given the myriad of issues with dire implica-tions he has to tackle, it certainly does not deserve his attention now.Trump’s decision to drum this is-sue back up is a reflection of two of the traits coming to define his ten-ure in office: his knack for diversion and his insistence on winning every battle he engages in— regardless of how trivial or impossible it may be. There is absolutely no way Donald Trump is going to stop NFL players from kneeling during the anthem. The whole issue has come to a stale-mate and that is exactly how it is go-ing to remain. But he refuses to let it go. One reason for his unreasonable tenacity on NFL protests is political. For his base, the dispute is a welcome distraction from the country’s more pressing issues—because it’s easy to make sense of it. If his supporters are allo-cating their energy at the Green Bay P a c k e r s , T r u m p can shift the dis-course a w a y f r o m topics like gun control in the wake o f  L a s Vegas or N o r t h Korea’s n e w l y d i s -c o v e r e d c y b e r -t e r r o r i s t capabilities. He can do all this while k e e p i n g his base r i l e d , passion-ate and deep in his corner.However, to call Trump’s tweet pure-ly political might be giving him too much credit. Though he under-stands the political rami-fications of what he is saying, I think he is gen-u i n e l y invested in winning this dis-pute. He was scorned when NFL owners were not receptive to his demand that they fire the “sons of b*****s” who knelt. He became even more upset when the league collectively dem-onstrated against him. He brought this issue up as a deflection, but that does not mean it is not personal for him. Donald Trump’s decision to re-hash the NFL controversy is a testa-ment to his character and political identity. Donald Trump the politician did it for political capital; Donald the man did it because he cannot settle for anything but consummate vic-tory. Both reasons are equally trou-bling. A great man once said, “To an-nounce that there must be no criti-cism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.” For the record, that was not Colin Kaepernick; that was Teddy Roosevelt.

Several major NFL teams have since taken on the mantle left by him.    APAP Thursday, October 26, 2017 The Santa Clara 7 / Sports Following a dramatic Game Two and with the series tied 1-1, Houston will take the title  Alex StewartThe Santa ClaraThe greatest two words in sports: Game Seven. As the 2017 World Series is under-way, fans have an enormous amount to be excited for. This is a Goliath versus Goli-ath affair as both teams have overpowering starting pitching, elite hitting and above average bullpens. In a previous article, I laid out my pre-dictions for the MLB postseason, and in terms of which teams advanced to which level, I have been one hundred percent correct. I don’t plan on ending my streak now, so here are my down-to-the- very-last-detail predictions for the remaining five games—and yes, this series will go all seven. Game ThreeFollowing their impressive victory in Game Two, all systems go for the Astros as they try to build on the Game Two mo-mentum. Lance McCullers Jr. will toe the rubber for Houston, and his counterpart will be Yu Darvish. That 87 mile-per-hour curveball, combined with stellar location of his fast-ball will turn in six strong innings of one run ball against the Dodgers, as the Astros crowd gets louder with every strike thrown. In terms of offense, the Astros’ power bats will catch fire, and turn in six solid runs. Brad Peacock will finish the job for the As-tros as they take this game six to one to make the series Astros two, Dodgers one. Game FourAstros fans will call for Charlie Morton’s resignation after this game. The Dodgers will feed off that 85 mile-per-hour power slider, as they saw him throw it in Game Six of the ALCS to help eliminate the Yankees. Corey Seager will make his name known in this one with a three-run homerun to deep right field off a hanging slider. After that, Chris Taylor will pad the lead with a RBI double. In the end, that will be enough for Dodg-er’s starter Alex Wood, as he, Brandon Mor-row and Kenley Jansen lock it down to tie the series two games to two in the series with this four to one win. Game FiveThe Astros will turn to Dallas Keuchel to keep their World Series hopes rolling. Astros fans will know that Clayton Kershaw looms in the opposing dugout, though. This game will be very scrappy, as some controversial calls, along with clutch hitting from Jose Altuve, will give the Astros the two to one win. Kershaw will take too much of the blame for this one in the media as the series heads back to Los Angeles with the Dodgers trail-ing two games to three. Game SixDodgers fans will pour into the stadium hoping to tie the series up. Justin Verlander will have something to say about that. Verlander will look like the Verlander in Game Two of the ALCS when he went nine innings with only giving up one run.Astros super utility player Marwin Gon-zalez will drive in scrappy outfielder Josh Reddick for the first run of this game. Josh Turner will find the same magic he had against the Cubs in the NLCS to keep the Dodger’s hopes alive. He will hit a two-run walkoff home run to tie the series at three games apiece. It will all come down to the best two words in sports: Game Seven.Game SevenGame Seven will be one for the record books. Both teams will empty their bull-pens, as both the Astros Charlie Morton and Dodgers Yu Darvish will be run out of the game early. Both offenses will be on fire and it will seem like no pitcher can buy an out. This game will go into extra innings and both teams will have to dip into their starters for bullpen help. In the top of the tenth, the five-foot-six Jose Altuve will flip a hanging Josh Fields slider over the left field fence. With the Astros ahead eight to seven, Dallas Keuchel will enter the game. He will flirt with a few baserunners on base, but ultimately become the World Se-ries MVP when he secures the Game Seven win for the Astros. The greatest experiment in baseball will have pulled off in a big way as the Astros, who had multiple hundred-loss seasons just a few years ago, will raise the famed World Series trophy for the first time in franchise history.

The Dodgers are favored in this series due to their fantastic regular season record of 104-58. However, even after a successful season, the 2017 World Series win is not secured for Los Angeles.STANDINGSMen’s SoccerTeam WCC  OverallSan Diego 2-0-1 8-3-2Portland 2-0-1 7-5-1Santa Clara 2-1-0 2-11-0Pacific 1-1-0 9-3-0San Francisco 1-1-0 4-8-0Saint Mary’s 1-2-0 4-6-3Loyola Marymount 1-2-0 3-9-2Gonzaga 0-3-0 6-6-1Women’s SoccerTeam WCC  OverallPepperdine 6-0-0 12-2-2Santa Clara 5-1-0 10-6-1San Diego 4-1-0 6-9-0Brigham Young 2-2-1 5-6-4Gonzaga 2-4-0 10-5-1San Francisco  2-4-0 6-9-2Saint Mary’s 2-4-0 6-10-0Pacific 2-4-0 5-10-2Portland 2-4-0 5-10-1Loyola Marymount 1-4-1 6-6-4VolleyballTeam WCC  OverallBringham Young 10-0 21-1San Diego 9-1 16-4Gonzaga 7-2 12-9Loyola Marymount 5-5 12-9Pacific 5-5 10-11Portland  4-5 13-8Pepperdine 4-6 12-11Santa Clara 3-7 10-12Saint Mary’s 2-8 6-14San Francisco 0-10 3-20UPCOMING GAMESMen’s SoccerSanta Clara @ Portland Fri. 10/27 7:00 p.m.Santa Clara @ Gonzaga Sun. 10/29 1:00 p.m.Santa Clara @ Loyola Marymount Sun. 11/5 1:00 p.m.Women’s Soccer San Francisco @ Santa Clara Sun. 10/27  5:00 p.m.San Diego @ Santa Clara Thu. 11/2 7:00 p.m.Brigham Young @ Santa Clara Sat. 11/4 1:00 p.m.VolleyballSanta Clara @ Portland Thu. 10/26  7:00 p.m.Santa Clara @ Gonzaga  Fri. 10/28 12:00 p.m.Santa Clara @ San Francisco Fri. 11/3 7:00 p.m.MADDY GONZALEZ FAMILY FIRE FUNDMaddy Gonzalez, a sophomore on the Santa Clara Women’s Soccer team, and her family were one of the thousands of families affected by the recent Northern California wildfires.

APWorld Series PredictionsSPORTSThursday, October 26, 20178Men’s Basketball Preview:High Hopes, Higher ExpectationsAddy CamisaThe Santa ClaraALL PHOTOS COURTESY OF SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITYTeam looks to build upon last year’s improvementsWith an increase in budget and a promising past season, Men’s Bas-ketball will look to put everything they have on the court this year.In their 2016-2017 season, the Santa Clara Men’s Basketball team had a record of 17-16 overall. This record proved to be an im-provement over past years  but still fell short of team and fan expecta-tions. However, gradual improve-ments are finally showing through. When asked about the pressures of continuing the success from last year, Head Coach Herb Sendek fo-cuses on further developing his team and integrating new players at the moment. “We always want to be the very best version of ourselves, but each year is independent and unique to itself,” Sendek said. “Right now we are at the beginning stages of be-coming a team and learning how to play together and defining our roles, getting ready for the season opener.”Coach Sendek seemed unintimi-dated by the pressures. “I don’t have any particular worries. I just want to do the best job I can, providing the appropriate leadership and coaching for our team.”In order to achieve their goals, Coach Sendek instills certain core values in his players. “We have three values we talk about in our program: trust, care and commitment,” Sendek said. “We have four goals that we try to accomplish on a daily basis: to learn, to improve, to connect and to serve.”As far as their preparation for the upcoming season goes, the team is constantly evolving. When asked if they are preparing any dif-ferently for this season than for those in the past, Coach Sendek explained that the team has been playing more in practice—which has helped to adjust their offen-sive and defensive schemes based on their evolving team and added players. Reflecting on continuing last season’s improvement, junior starting point guard KJ Feagin said, “We continue that success by staying humble and listening to our amazing coaching staff. And as a group, holding each other ac-countable on a daily basis on and off the court. Taking things one day at a time and letting the rest take care of itself.” This year the team hopes to use their momentum from their previ-ous season.“I’m looking forward to how we capitalize off of the success we had last year and to do even better this year because we have a group of guys who are willing to do whatever it takes to win,” senior starting for-ward Jarvis Pugh said.Regarding their talented return-ing players, Pugh said that they “have a group of guys who are ex-perienced and are returners from last year’s team and [he thinks they] can bring that leadership to the new guys and bring them up to speed.” Feagin agrees. “This team is a good mix of experience and youth. We have more depth than last year and will use that to our advantage,” he said.The Santa Clara Men’s Basket-ball team has only appeared in the NCAA tournament eleven times.The Broncos have not appeared in the tournament since 1996. In these eleven appearances, they have advanced to the Final Four once and have never won the championship. However, last sea-son’s record showed vast improve-ment.Recently, NBC Sports ranked Santa Clara fifth in their West Coast Conference preseason rankings. Though that doesn’t spell out hopes for a NCAA tournament ap-pearance, this high ranking could help to push the Broncos in the right direction.
