While the punk subculture \nhas been analyzed in-depth by such notable theorists as Dick Hebdige and Stuart Hall, their \nwork has been limited to examining the rise and apparent decline of the subculture in England, \nrendering any further investigations into punk as looking back at a nostalgic novelty of post-\nWorld War II British milieu. Furthermore, the commodification of punk music and style has \nrelegated punk to the realm of an alternative culture in Britain and locally in the U.S. In these \ncurrent international incarnations, however, a social space for this alternative culture is \nthreatened by severe punishment including what Indonesian police officials have label “moral \nrehabilitation” and, in the case of Russian punks, imprisonment. Punk today is once more—or, \nfor the first time, truly becoming—an oppositional culture as described by Raymond Williams, \nrather than a non-threatening alternative. The international punk scene has become deeply \nconnected to other punks through the internet, creating a growing global community. Through \nmusical and stylistic culture, punk offers its members much more: a voice that questions \nestablished values, that screams for change. In these nations where punks have little agency in \npolitical and social matters, a guitar and a microphone offer a means of speaking. The \ncommunal aspect of punk creates an arena for those involved to foster a culture of dialogue and \ndissent. \n \n \n \nFrom Subculture to Pop Culture \n \nPunk is Dead. \n \nIn 1978, the anarchist punk band Crass released their debut album entitled The Feeding of the \n5000. A standout track from the record was the song “Punk is Dead,” a scathing critique of the \npunk subculture a mere year after its explosion in the mainstream media, facilitated by the acrid \nantics and music of The Sex Pistols. Anticipating what would be the conclusion of Dick \nHebdige’s seminal text, Subculture: The Meaning of Style, published one year later, the final \nverse of the song states: \n  \n \n \n1\nLalama: Transnational Punk\n  \n I see the velvet zippies in their bondage gear, \n the social elite with safety-pins in their ear. \n I watch and understand that it don't mean a thing. \n The scorpions might attack, but the systems stole the sting (“Punk is Dead” 1978). \n \nEnding the song is the repeated chant of “Punk is dead,” by lead vocalist Steve Ignorant (real \nname Steve Williams) who is joined by the other members of the group until the last the strained \nutterance of the word “dead” that is sustained for several seconds before the song abruptly ends. \nCrass’s anarchistic punk project was deeply rooted “direct action” by spray-painting stenciled \ngraffiti messages around the London Underground system and on advertising billboards, \ncoordinating squats, and organizing political action (Glasper, 25). Yet the band also viewed the \npunk movement as something that had a limited lifespan. From the outset, the band insisted that \nthey would disband in 1984, the Orwellian overtones of government control and surveillance \nassociated with that year no doubt playing into their choice. The catalog numbers for each \nrelease on their record label, Crass Records, attested to this certainty: the number being \ncomposed of the number of years to 1984 in the format of X21984, X amount of years to 1984. \nIndeed, the group disbanded in that very year, leaving behind an influential view of punk that \nwas political and active. Still, punk became absorbed by the mainstream media and commodities \nmarket, as Dick Hebdige has noted: \n  \n Each subculture moves through a cycle of resistance and de-fusion and we have seen how \n this cycle is situated within the larger cultural and commercial matrices. Subcultural \n deviance is simultaneously rendered “explicable” and meaningless in the classrooms, \n courts and media at the same time as the “secret” objects of subcultural style are put on \n display in every high street record shop and chain-store boutique. Stripped of its \n unwholesome connotations, the style becomes fit for public consumption (Subculture, \n 130). \n \nFor Hebdige, Punk was unable to become a persistent subculture the moment it was rendered \nacceptable by the mainstream media and capitalist industry. Thus any examination of the idea of \na punk subculture beyond England in 1979 must then study punk as a phenomenon that did not \ndefine itself and its resistance through this oblique style. As a result, punk has become seen as \nanother merely another “alternative” group for youth to find a sort of acceptance that is easily \naccessible and mildly annoying to parents, but will eventually become eschewed as they “grow \nup.” This image of punk has become the dominant one in many mainstream images of the scene \nin popular television and movies, such as the short-lived sitcom “That 80s Show” and the motion \npicture “SLC Punk.” The latter’s ending boldly proclaiming the place that punk typically holds \nfor many youths: it is just an outlet for teenage rebellion that is aimless. The protagonist in the \nfilm, Steve-O, follows the typical bildungsroman associated with punks, eventually becoming a \nHarvard-educated lawyer, admitting at the film’s conclusion: “I guess when all was said and \ndone, I was nothing more than a God-damned, trendy-ass poser” (SLC Punk, 1998). The Sex \nPistols' John Lydon—better known as Johnny Rotten—once the emblem of a subversive \nmovement, now advertises Country Life butter in Britain (NME, 2010); the band Green Day, \nwho has been equally embraced and repudiated by many fans of punk music, has produced a \nsuccessful Broadway musical, “American Idiot.” Thus, it seems the teleological end of punk \nmusic and its subsequent cultural manifestation was not some ultimate change in social or \n2\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 3 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol3/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201303.09\nLalama 3 \n \npolitical change—or even a lasting cultural change, since the aesthetic and sartorial aspect of \npunk would simply become commodified and thus rendered harmless. However, punk music and \nthe development of an punk ethos or ideology still continued to grow in a less spectacular form \nin underground and independent music scenes throughout the world. \n  \nPunk is Everywhere. \n  \n  Craig O’Hara, guitarist for the early 1990s punk band Filth from Berkley, California, \ndescribed the legacy of the punk subculture as a having one goal: punk is a way to “express rage \nin an original way…not only by looking and sounding different…but by questioning prevailing \nmodes of thought” (The Philosophy of Punk 27-28). Here, there is a challenge to the pessimistic \nview of punk’s potential by earlier critics like Hebdige and Stuart Hall, who saw punk merely in \nterms of semiotic disruption and noise of already existent in the cultural and social milieu of a \npost-WWII welfare state. The fact that punk music still continues on, though lacking the cultural \nvalence and social cache it had in late 1970s Britain, reflects something deeper within the punk \nproject. It is no longer just stylistic or musical rebellion, but creates a community dedicated to \nthe cause of questioning prevailing modes of thought. It would be difficult to say that punk itself \nis a method or system for possible social change or challenge to oppression, but it serves as a \ncatalyst for the creation of a consciousness and identity based around music that champions not \nonly questioning the dominant system or ideology, but also questioning one’s own place within \nthis context. Following Guy DeBord’s definition of spectacle in Society of the Spectacle as \n“something enormously positive, indisputable and inaccessible” (Thesis 12), punk seeks to \nchallenge the spectacle as something elevated above the common everyday individual. \nTraditionally, the spectacle results in the Marxist sense of alienation of the working class from \nthe modes of production: the performer on stage would be elevated from the audience, dictating \nthe content and boundaries of the spectacle performance (Marcus 98-99). Punk did not continue \nthis idea of the spectacle as something positive and inaccessible. It negated all values of the \ndominant culture and attempted to destroy the boundaries between performer and audience by \nspeaking in this common language of disaffectedness and nihilism. Punk becomes a collective \nutterance of resistance that continues its existence through the active participation of its members \nby creating the music, circulating the music which results in the circulation of new ideas and new \nthoughts that the members of the punk community may have not previously had access. \n \nWe’re Coming Back For You: New Scenes of Resistance. \n  \n In the past few years, after a sort of hibernation period of punk in the mainstream media, \nthere have been recent incidents in which members of the punk subculture have caused \ndisruption and outcry across the globe. The stories concerned take in place in Indonesia, Russia \nand Iraq—thousands of miles and four decades after the “summer of ‘77” that introduced punk \nrock to mainstream culture. The people who pursue punk within these nations are subject to \npolitical and social circumstances that have lead to severe forms of oppression: imprisonment, \nwhat one regime calls \"moral rehabilitation\" and in some cases death. Whereas in the U.S. and \nBritain, punk has been simply relegated to being another form of subculture that has been \nincorporated into the dominant hegemonic order and repackaged as a sometimes annoying but \nessentially harmless alternative lifestyle, within these countries, punk has become an indelible \nmarker of one’s identity that marks one as part of a larger social group that poses a threat to the \n3\nLalama: Transnational Punk\n  \nestablished mode of society. Indeed, punk has once again (or perhaps, for the first time) an \nemergent, oppositional culture that was initially described by Raymond Williams. For Williams, \nthe emergent culture brings with it “new meanings and values, new practices, new significances \nand experiences” that are “continually being created” (41). A further distinction is to be found \nwithin these emergent cultures, namely, that they can either be alternative or oppositional. The \nalternative culture is the dominant view of punk comes to mind in the U.S.: the punk as an \nindividual who simply finds a different way to live and wishes to be left alone. These recent \nevents, however, reveal punk as being perceived as an oppositional subculture in that seeks for \n“a different way to live and wants to change the society in its light” (Williams 42). Furthermore, \nthere is a distinctiveness associated with the new instances of punk seen in these areas of Asia \nand the near East. The dominant views of subcultures that were used to explain the rise of groups \nlike punk were believed to all derive from a working-class parent culture (Hall et. al. 13). It \ninvariably holds some things in common with its parent culture, not to be confused with the \ndominant culture. They therefore coexist within the parent culture. For those schooled in the \nCentre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS), such as Hall and Hebdige, punk fit into this \nsubcultural mode. Yet this view of the punk subculture no longer holds weight within these \nemerging instances that have evolved in a completely different milieu from which punk \noriginally sprang. By first examining these new subcultural formations, punk’s relevance as a \nmechanism for expression and change can be unearthed, revitalizing the relevance of something \nthat has been cast aside as nothing more than just noise. \n  \nAnarchy in Aceh: Punks in Indonesia. \n \n This new thrust of punk into cultural relevance began on December 10, 2011, when a \npunk rock concert was scheduled to take place in Taman Bundaya park in Aceh, Indonesia, a \nprovince of that country that has its own police force pledged to maintain Muslim sharia law. \nSharia, meaning \"path\" in Arabic, guides all aspects of Muslim life including daily routines, \nfamilial and religious obligations, and financial dealings (Johnson and Vriens, 2011). That is, it \nis more than a legal system but a moral code used to guide a structure of living for devout \nMuslim life. Upon arriving early to the concert, sixty-four of the attendees—who had travelled \nfrom all over the country—were arrested, and taken to a nearby detention center, eventually \nbeing later transported to a \"remedial school\" thirty-seven miles away. The concert was never \nperformed, it being cancelled at the behest of deputy mayor Illiza Sa’aduddin Djamal on the \npremise that the organizers had “fooled the authorities into granting them a permit to hold the \nevent” (Hasan, 2011). The revocation of the permit was based on Djamal’s claim that the concert \nwas supposed to be a benefit for orphanages but that the punks had falsified this claim, though no \nproof was produced to support the idea of deception on the part of the punks. Djamal commented \non the issue, saying: “The concert would have been an abomination to Islamic teaching, and they \nalso committed a permit violation…this [punk] group threatens [Islamic] faith and deviates very \nwidely from Islamic teachings, which is why we had to break up the concert” (Hasan, 2011). \nAccording to Fathun Karib, founder of Locos Indonesia, punk group promoting youth culture \nempowerment, the rise of punk in Indonesia follows a period opposition to the Suharto regime—\nwhich fell in 1998. That is not to say that the exposure to the music was completely absent from \nthe nation until that period, but this is when the music began to crystallize around economic and \npolitical foundations (Kalim et. al., 2012). During the final years of the Suharto regime on its last \nlegs punks tended to be left alone as most of the rebellion against the regime came in the form of \n4\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 3 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol3/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201303.09\nLalama 5 \n \nstudent movements of resistance, making concerns with punk negligible (Harris, 2012). Yet, with \nthe rise of international interaction through internet media, punk began to proliferate within \nIndonesia. Concurrently, a peace deal came about by separatists of the Free Aceh Movement, \nknown as Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM), who sought to independence for the Aceh province \nfrom the Indonesian nation. Although there has continued to be some tensions between remnants \nof the Gam and the Indonesian state, the province has been granted free elections and relative \nautonomy (BBC, 2005). Without the elevated conflict between rebels and government, focus has \nturned towards punks as dissidents within the province. Karib has noted that “now the punks \nhave access to international networks, so the issue became bigger than the local politicians \nexpected” (Harris, 2012). While in the “rehabilitation camp,” the punks’ mohawks were forcibly \nremoved, their punk clothing confiscated and they were subjected to being plunged into what \nInspector General Iskandar Hasan called “washing pools” (The Jakarta Globe, 2011). Another \npolice spokesperson commented that the group was being held so that they could \"undergo a re-\neducation, so their morals will match those of other Acehnese people\" (Harris, 2012).  \n Behind these oppressive acts lies questions of the “proper” and “true” way to live within \nthis province highly committed to Muslim law. The exertion of power over the Banda Aceh \npunks in the name of “truth” recalls Foucault’s views on the relationship between truth and \npower. “Truth,” Foucault stated, “is linked in a circular relation with systems of power which \nproduce and sustain it, and to effects of power which it induces and which extends it. A ‘regime’ \nof truth” (74). The punks, whose dress and music posed a possible alternative to this truth, due to \nthe nature of sharia law, cannot possibly be incorporated or codified by it. Producing social \npractices and identifying markers that resist absorption by the dominant hegemony, thus the \nhegemonic order of Banda Aceh itself has to transform this alternative subculture—which \nthreatened to reveal an aporia of the complete, unquestionable truth of sharia law—into an \noppositional subculture as described by Raymond Williams. It is unsurprising, then given \nFoucault’s view of the power/truth/knowledge axiom, that in the case of Banda Aceh the \nmechanism for controlling the emerging group of punks is to focus on the body. Rather than \nsimply decrying punks as immoral blasphemers, fostering a moral panic by showing how vastly \ndifferent and deviant punks are, as was the case in Britain, according to Hebdige, the police force \nthere enforced their so-called “moral re-education” that also involved a changing of the body. By \nthe shaving of heads, the physical removal of clothing and of forced submersion in a pool of \nwater, there is clearly the exercise of a “policy of coercions that act upon the body, a calculated \nmanipulation of its elements, its gestures, its behaviors” (Foucault 182). The punk subculture’s \nexpression and identity is clearly very centered in bodily presentation and interaction. Style \ncomes immediately to mind when speaking of a punk body: the mohawk, bondage pants and so \nforth. The removal of these articles vastly reduces the immediate image and connection to the \nsubculture, reducing the individual to be immediately associated with the dominant group \nthrough a stylistic transformation that presents them as part of that group. Susan Bordo has called \nthe body a “medium of culture” onto which “the central rules, hierarchies and even metaphysical \ncommitments of a culture are inscribed and thus reinforced” (165). The punk body then becomes \na rejection of these hierarchies and rules, as its presentation is of a different possibility of \nconceiving the body. The body becomes the site of subcultural practice that the hegemonic order \nmust turn into a Foucauldian docile body so that order and power are maintained. \n The interactions of bodies is also of crucial importance examining the crackdown on \npunks in Indonesia. The arrests, or “detainments,” of these punks began with the cancellation of \na concert, an important activity within the punk community. Greil Marcus’ study of the rise of \n5\nLalama: Transnational Punk\n  \npunk in Britain placed the impetus of punk as being the transformation of the spectacle, \ndisrupting the divide between the performer and audience to lift the veil of ideology (98-99). \nWendy Fonarow has also examined the concert as a crucial aspect of punk subcultural, especially \nin how space and spatial organization affect the interaction between people and bodies at a \nconcert. The independent music concert, especially punk shows, “present rather uncommon \nbodily conditions for social interaction…intimate physical contact with strangers” (Fonarow, \n362). The participants in these events, in the wake of continuous physical interaction, are \nenthusiastically supportive rather than being uncooperative. Punk concerts then become a space \nfor the gathering of many people from different places, backgrounds and ideas who are joined \ntogether through this physical interaction of concert-going, whether the contact is through \ndancing or “moshing” purposefully or simply being present in the physical space of other people. \nŽižek, following Lacan, refers to this unification of these free-floating, open identities that exist \nin space as the point de capiton, or the “quilting-point.” This point stops meaning from sliding \nabout inside the ideological space, anchoring it in order to create identity. The ideological field \nthen transforms an abstract, arbitrary concept into something which has a concrete existence. It \ncreates boundaries that also allow for any variation of the whole without undermining the \nstructure of the whole (Žižek, 95-97). The punk rock concert can then act as the “quilting-point” \nof a punk identity that become unified and expresses itself concretely through the bodily action \nof the performer and audience. As has been noted in Griel Marcus’ work, for the punk \nsubculture, being a part of the audience is as much an involvement in the production of a \nperformance as the band, since this division between actor and observer is obliterated in the punk \nperformance. The Banda Aceh sharia police force’s attempts at rehabilitation obviously seek to \noverturn these effects, initially by preventing the concert to even occur then by their substitution \nof a “ritual cleansing” of the punks which has required them to bow themselves once again \nbefore sharia law. Law and power have then been lifted above those who must observe it, \nrebuilding the divide that punk has sought to sever.  \n These actions of the Banda Aceh government have not gone unnoticed in the wider punk \ncommunity. Although not receiving any significant mass media attention on television, these \nactions caused a strong stir of anger within the punk community. In response, many London \npunks staged a solidarity protest outside of the Indonesian embassy; another similar march took \nplace at the Indonesian Consulate in San Francisco. These events were organized around \nconnections with punks through internet sites such as Facebook, organizing the punk collective \nthrough social media. Moreover, to help financially support the punk scene, the website PUNK \nAID was established (www.punkaid.org) where fellow punks can donate, purchase a benefit \ncompilation consisting of bands from across the globe, expressing their support for the \noppression and abuse of the rights of the Banda Aceh punks. Sites and events such as these \nreflect the decline of the insularity that punk has traditionally harbored, especially with the \nnotion of local “scenes” that punks bands once were associated with and embraced. Being a punk \nfrom southern California versus a punk from Boston or London each had their own specific \nattributes: different takes on the punk musical style, different sartorial styles, and many times \ndifferent political or social views. The spread of punk into nations besides the hotbeds of the \nU.S. or England is nothing new, but the transnational support and affiliation between these \ngroups is something which is a recent phenomenon resulting from easier connection to other \npunks through message boards, accessibility to music from bands that may have never been \nheard in other nations without its easy accessibility online. \n  \n6\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 3 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol3/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201303.09\nLalama 7 \n \n \n \nWeapons of Mass Oppression: Violence in Iraq. \n \n Regulation of the punk body is seen in more extreme form in recent reports from Iraq \nconcerning the murder by stoning of nearly eighty punk, emo and gay youth since February. In \nthese violent instances, the attacks have been focused on homosexual men and kids who dress \n“emo.” The term emo—a shortened form of the original term, emotional hardcore—has its roots \nin the Washington D.C. hardcore punk scene of the early 1980s. Springing forth as a reaction \nagainst the violence within that particular scene, emo embraced a focus on the individual and \npersonal politics and sought to break the rigid boundaries that had come to encompass hardcore \npunk to foster emotional expression and foster an expansion of creativity in the musically and \nlyrically stagnant punk scene (Greenwald, 12-14). More recently, it has become more associated \nwith a stylistic subculture that usually includes tight jeans, dyed hair with long bangs and band t-\nshirts, adopting some of the influence of the punk sartorial mode. The targets have nearly all \nbeen male; a chilling warning publicly announced to any others who are gay or dress in emo \ngarb: “We warn in the strongest terms to every male and female debauchee. If you do not stop \nthis dirty act within four days, then the punishment of God will fall on you at the hands of \nMujahideen\" (Jakes, 2012). Furthermore, many of those killed have had their bodies \ndismembered or burned alive (Zurutuza, 2012). What is crucial in these instances has been the \nconflation between punk or emo subculture and homosexuality. Despite further pushes in Iraq for \nhuman rights and freedom of expression, a crucial crossroads occurs in the nation as Ashwaq Jaf, \na senator for the Kurdish Alliance, stated: “The heart of the problem…is that we have two penal \ncodes: the Iraqi Constitution, but also sharia law. Contradictions between the two often lead to \nambiguous and dangerous legal vacuums” (Zurutuza, 2012). \n Being homosexual is against sharia law, which is in effect in Iraq. By presenting this \nsubculture as an inherently homosexual and, in the eyes of sharia law, immoral one, a new \nrelationship between the subculture and parent culture is opened up. For Stuart Hall, the \nsubculture was able to exist within its parent culture because it shared some of the same values \nas that parent culture, but rejected that culture so as to reshape or reform its past or legacy. \nTherefore any instance of apparent protest or resistance between the two groups did not lead to \nany significant social or structural changes. However, by situating the punk/emo/goth \nsubcultures of Iraq as an inherently queer subculture, this coexistence becomes rendered \nimpossible, since it does not appear to share, at least to the parent and dominant cultures, any \nviews or values of the older generation. Rather than a sort of oedipal relationship that seeks to \nfight the parent culture but ultimately shares its views, a queer subculture is “not located in any \neasy relation to the parent culture” (Halberstam, 160). A subculture that already appears alien or \nother within the dominant and parent cultures is rendered even more extremely different when it \nis (or is associated with) a queer subculture. With this connection between these subcultural \ngroups being drawn, the body’s potential for subversion or expression then becomes a reiteration \nof the dominant power (Bordo, 167). By dressing as a punk or as an emo youth, seen as an \nexpression of control over individuality becomes a social marker for an illusory deviance or \nabnormality which, in the case of Iraq, leads some members of that nation to see its destruction \nas the only way to maintain the dominant order. If the body cannot be rendered docile, it must be \ndestroyed and this act is being passed along to others so that they are left with the choice to \nsurrender their body to control or risk lives. The body becomes not a vehicle for performance but \n7\nLalama: Transnational Punk\n  \na living discourse that can be burned if it threatens the dominant discourse, much like book \nburnings seen in some repressive states. \n In these instances where punk is seen as a threat to the order, especially one founded on \nreligious principles and laws, punk’s potential power and appeal becomes something which \nbecomes realized in different locales. As Frank Cartledge’s article on the punk’s initial \nemergence, “Distress to Impress?” argues, urban environments that produced punk divorced it \nfrom any threat. Therefore, places such as London, New York and other hotbeds of the \nemergence of punk scenes, the cosmopolitanism of these areas “act as a buffer against violent \nconformism in a way impossible in the provinces” (171). Thus being a punk in London was not \nas subversive as being a punk in a small town where traditions and values were more deeply \nrooted. Indeed, within these locales, the subjugation is not merely of a culture and subculture, but \nthe active violence and oppression seeks to turn punk from subculture to a subaltern. On \nsubalternity, Spivak argued that, “The assumption and construction of a consciousness or subject \nsustains such work and will, in the long run, cohere with the work of imperialist subject-\nconstitution, mingling epistemic violence with the advancement of learning and civilization” \n(295). While Spivak’s view of the subaltern was itself centered on the specific victims of the \nwidow-burning phenomenon in India, her notion of the suppression of one’s voice or \nsubjectivity, especially in culture’s that seek to retain dominance over small social groups that \nhold little political or cultural currency, is relevant in these instances of oppression of punks. \nWith these groups, the violence is not only epistemic but also physical. Moreover, the dominant \ncodes are not only political or economical but also religious in nature, religion being an \nimportant epistemological tool of these regions. Outward signs of identity, however, require \nmore than manipulation of the language of knowledge; bodily violence and force is required to \nsilence them. The denial of a sartorial semiotics to express ideas hinders the punks. They also \ncannot speak since their identification does not allow them access to the linguistic and religious \ndiscourse which allows the dominant power to exert itself over them. By turning to international \nconnections through the internet’s worldwide integration and communication, a new ideology \nand community can be established which does not need to rely on dominant discourse or clothing \nto pass along the punk subculture’s message and subversion.  \n  \nRocket to Russia: Pussy Riot and Direct Action \n \nThe most explicit instance of direct punk rebellion—and the one which has gathered the most \ncoverage by the U.S. and other European media— is the Russian all-female punk band called \nPussy Riot. The coverage and scrutiny comes from the direct action of three of its members who \nwere arrested in February after they took over the pulpit in Moscow’s Christ the Savior \nCathedral to recite a “punk prayer” written in opposition to Vladimir Putin. The group cried out \nin unison, “Black cassock, golden epaulettes; all believers crawl and prostrate” and chanted \nrepeatedly, “Mother of God, Blessed Virgin, drive out Putin!” (Parfitt 2012). Subsequently, these \nmembers of the collective were sentenced to two years in a prison colony after being found \nguilty of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” (Elder 2012). This recent act, too, has \nadded to the revitalization of punk as a subversive, oppositional form. Whereas the events of \nIndonesia have shown an oppression of a punk subculture that did not engage in any real direct \nrebellion or attack on authority, Pussy Riot’s project is explicitly political and active. The fears \nof the dominant Indonesian culture that suppressed the punks reached its manifestation by the \nactions of Pussy Riot. Members of the group perform in identity-concealing balaclavas while the \n8\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 3 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol3/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201303.09\nLalama 9 \n \nband itself has a free-floating membership that can number up to 15 people to create “a pulsating \nand growing body,” according to band member Garadzha Matveyeva (Harris, 2012). The group \nhas built is foundation on the Riot Grrrl movement, a feminist vision of the punk subculture \nbeginning in the early 1990’s that incorporated music, art and political activism expressing the \nfrustration and experience of being a young woman in a patriarchal society (Jackson, 261). On \nthe influence of Riot Grrrl ethos on Pussy Riot, Matveyeva remarked that: \n  \n We [Pussy Riot] somehow developed what [those groups] did in the 1990s, although in \n an absolutely different context and with an exaggerated political stance which leads to all \n of our performances being illegal…we'll never give a gig in a club or in any special \n musical space. That's an important principle for us (Harris, 2012). \n \nKey to Matveyeva’s remark is the idea of progression of the punk subculture. The band’s views \nand tactics are indebted to a historical moment in the history of punk while its applicability \ntranscends its contextual and historical moment. Also crucial is the location of content of the act \nthat resulted in arrest. Their “punk prayer” is in a sense really a prayer in that we see an \ninvocation a spiritual entity to help those who are suffering. Yet, their prayer was not executed in \nthe bodily position of kneeling or prostration but at the altar of a Russian Orthodox church, an \narea usually reserved for the priest. By taking over this space in the church but not occupying the \nposition in the church hierarchy to do so, the audience (worshippers) then becomes the performer \n(priest). Their beckoning was not to God but to Mary, a feminine symbol, not for strength to \nendure the pain or subjection that Christian prayer usually entails but for a forceful action of \ndriving Putin out. They speak through the medium of religious worship, much like punk has \nspoken through the words of music. Utterances that subvert norms then are in part bodily and in \npart performative. Whereas performance may not be subversive in some locales, it is at the heart \nof rebellion in those nations where punk is being oppressed. Location and context then allows \npunk, as just kids dressing up in Western culture, to become something empowering and \nsubversive in nations that do not have a long punk history that has been usurped and rebranded \nas fashion or merely entertainment. Yet, the acceptability of punk in the U.S., Britain and other \nnations has acted as a useful means of support for the group, especially given the dubiousness of \ntheir trial and sentence. Another member of the group, Nadezhda “Nadya” Tolokonnikova, in a \nprison interview saw the importance of punks in these culturally and economically nations: “The \namount of Western support that we got is a miracle. I believe that if Russia had independent \nnational media, our performance would be better understood at home as well. Right now we're in \nhell here” (Idov, 2012). Here, the connection of punks across the globe shows its importance, \nespecially with the rise of internet connectivity and accessibility to news from across the globe. \nThis performance does not need to rely on the clothing worn or the venue: it must become an \nopen form of identity that allows for a performance of a wide array of actions and productions \nwhich challenge the dominant codes. \n Another central issue in the case of Pussy Riot is punk and gender, specifically since \npunk music has a common association with males and masculinity, especially within the U.S. \nwith the development of the very violent and angst-filled “hardcore” punk scene that found its \nnexus in the Washington D.C. area of the early 1980s. Lauraine Leblanc’s central text on punk \nand feminism, Pretty in Punk, helped to develop a growing investigation on the relationship \nbetween gender and punk. For women, Leblanc argues, the construction of identity and \naffiliation to punk is not simply relegated to style; “to gain acceptance in the group, they must \n9\nLalama: Transnational Punk\n  \nlearn, espouse, and exhibit punk beliefs, attitudes, and ‘mentality’” (220). Yet, entering into punk \nsubculture, for Leblanc, forces women distance themselves from other females, adopting a punk \nidentity to construct femininity they can inhabit. Punk creates a space for those females who \nchose to identify it, but can be an isolating act, creating an individualized sense of resistance \nrather than a collective one that puts a woman in the larger context of a punk culture or identity \n(Leblanc 148). Given the place of women in Russian society, where the Gunda Werner Institute \nfor Feminism and Democracy states that “To this day, the scope for free choice of occupation or \ntype of work is still restricted for women in the Russia Federation” (2012), the importance of the \na female punk group being the progenitors of a resistance movement in the nation speaks to the \nplace of punk in creating a sense of agency and subjectivity. Through their actions, Pussy Riot \nhave at once gained an important step in establishing a new voice for the women’s struggle in \nRussia while also revitalizing the activism of the punk subculture, moving it away from strictly \nbeing based on simple musical performance, while at the same time re-establishing the goals of \nthe early activist punk bands who did not rely solely on music as a mechanism for initiating the \nchange they desired.  \n  \nThe Shape of Punk to Come: Resist to Exist. \n \nStacy Thompson’s Punk Productions has argued for punk itself to be a field of \ncontradiction between aesthetics and economics where the ultimate goal of the subculture is the \npush for change. Specifically, for Thompson, it is a change of the capitalistic mode of production \nwhich will lead to a change in culture and dominant ideology (2). The do-it-yourself culture of \npunk that developed as young people attempted to insulate themselves from the culture industry \nand consumer lifestyles in their search for expressive sincerity and anti-commercial purity \ntransformed media and consumer identities into independent networks of cultural production that \nallowed spectators to become participants, and created a space for public debate and dissent. \n(Moore 323) In the contradictory space of consumer and producer, aesthetics and economics, \npunk then can function as the active “man-in-mass” that Gramsci has described. This person, as \nGramsci argued, caught between two hegemonic forces. Here punk and the dominant hegemony \nand a sense of contradiction between these two can lead one to passivity, but creating such a \nstruggle as to allow one to reach a point of a political consciousness where theory and practice \ncan become one (333). Thompson’s conception of a “punk commodity” that is a “good” \ncommodity nonetheless renders it part of the hegemonic economic mode of production. \nThompson sees punk as a contradiction that can be resolved through theory but in practice it ends \nup replicating the contradiction no matter how one looks at it. The contradiction can be useful as \nGramsci has shown: “Critical understanding of self takes place therefore through a struggle of \npolitical “hegemonies” and of opposing directions” (333). That is to say, the contradictions seen \nin punk since its inception, between aesthetic subversion and political subversion, performative \nand authentic identity needs to be embraced and pushed through to its logical conclusion: a punk \nhegemony. By trying to specifically locate punk in a specific socio-historical context, it becomes \nstagnant. This is not the case, as the proliferation of punk worldwide is evident through these \nexamples of oppressive measures and actions taken to quell it. The Indonesian punks, the emo \nkids in Iraq and Pussy Riot all represent different punk ideologies and views but none of them \nveers drastically from an overall hegemonic view of what punk is: a challenge to the domination \nand oppression.  \n10\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 3 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol3/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201303.09\nLalama 11 \n \n Indeed, as Kristiansen et.al. have argued in Screaming for Change, punk must no longer \nbe analyzed as style or music, rather it must be approached as an ideology, what they call a \n“unifying philosophy of deviance” that allows that is, punk as a mechanism that allows for one to \nengage in dissent: to listen to what they want, wear what they want, and state their dissatisfaction \nwith the status quo (144-147). I wish to take it further and stress that punk ideology is not \nenough: a punk hegemony that functions as a counter-hegemony to the “spontaneous,” passive \nconsent that Antonio Gramsci articulated as the function of hegemony to maintain the status quo \nand class relations (12-13). A punk ideology allows the individual a sense of their individual \npower through a collective affiliation and action; hegemony allows for the accommodation of \nmany different ideologies without disrupting the overall structure of ideas that define and \ndesignate the hegemonic group. Furthermore, hegemony is in constant flux and subject to \nadopting new practices, as Raymond Williams has argued. The key to a punk hegemony is to \nembrace contradictions within the ideology and to shift the hegemony based on the consent of \nthose within the subculture. Thus, with the increased connection between punks through the \ninternet and the adoption of a hegemonic punk view, the subculture can then function much like \nthe conception of an imagined community espoused by Benedict Anderson, embracing and \npromoting the notion of a horizontal comradeship within that community as a real possibility \nrather than merely an illusory ideal (7). Moreover, this would be a community that is not limited \nby national boundaries which dictate its shape and existence; it would be a fluid, dynamic \ncommunity which connects those who are disillusioned by the state of the globalized world. \nThere need not be simply the local communities of gathered around specific punk scenes or \nnations, but bring together all punks from varying cultures, nations, genders and economic \nsituations. Hebdige argued that signs and rhythms conveyed through music allowed for forging \nof affective alliances, creating a “diasporan” identity amongst the African-American  urban \ndispossessed. This identity transcended geographical distances and localisms creating a \ncongregation of peoples around this identity that builds community as well as providing support \nfor particular and local struggles for the members of this group (Hiding in the Light, 214-215). \nAlthough there is not a diaspora component to the international network of the punk subculture, \nthere is still a connection of people who face struggle that have formed this affective alliance \nthrough the sartorial signs and musical rhythms of punk. With this connection, deeper \nideological constructs can be developed that allows for carry over of punk ideals from one \ngeographic location to another while an internationally based community can lend support as the \nworld in more interconnected. Furthermore, typical views of authenticity that plague punk, trying \nto construct a strict view of punk, whether in the sound of the music, type of clothing etc. \nAdorno has remarked how speaking of authenticity leads to views that are “just as standardized \nas the world that it officially negates” (6). When the question of authenticity is no longer \nrendered necessary, the political dimension of the subculture can be realized, just as Walter \nBenjamin argued considering authenticity and art (1056). A punk hegemony allows typical \nanalyses of punk as simple British/American youth subcultures to be expanded into an \ninternational network, not defined by age or authenticity as far as style. Therefore, it remains \nrelevant as the negation of dominion and oppression without constricting punk to set, specific \nconcepts, expanding its revolutionary potential. As Indonesia, Iraq and Russia experience a \nproliferation of the subversiveness inherent in punk, perhaps this will reanimate its antagonistic \ncore in this country, rescuing punk from the doldrums of alternative subculture to an oppositional \nculture founded on more than just music: social and political change for those who have no \npower. With this view, perhaps this subculture will be able to not only speak but shout. Crass \n11\nLalama: Transnational Punk\n  \nwere obviously wrong: Punk is not dead, but constantly evolving. A punk ethos or ideology \nsurpasses simply the music or style: it becomes a powerful new tool that allows people under \nrepressive government regimes to find a voice, to scream out their oppression. Before, punks \nwere simply just a punch of kids rebelling against their parents’ culture which they would \neventually emulate. Now, with the incidents in Banda Aceh, Iraq and Moscow, the punk \nsubculture is a tool for catalyzing revolution and rebellion in a fashion that is quite new and \nunique in these parts of the globe. With them, there is a need for a complete reversal of \ndomination and ideological repression and the establishment of a culture that will not accept \nwhat is given but question these injustices and, moreover, push for a direct action that seeks to \ncause real world change. Pussy Riot sums up the movement of agency and subjectivity ushered \nin by the revitalization of punk in their song “Putin Got Scared” where the simple phrase “We \nExist!” reveals the importance of taking punk seriously as a tool for mobilization and social \nchange (www.freepussyriot.org).\n12\nLUX: A Journal of Transdisciplinary Writing and Research from Claremont Graduate University, Vol. 3 [2013], Iss. 1, Art. 9\nhttp://scholarship.claremont.edu/lux/vol3/iss1/9\nDOI: 10.5642/lux.201303.09\nLalama 13 \n \nWorks Cited \n \nAdorno, Theodor W.

    "abstract": "Little media attention has been devoted to the burgeoning punk scene that has raised alarm abroad in areas such as Banda Aceh, Indonesia and Moscow, Russia. While the punk subculture has been analyzed in-depth by such notable theorists as Dick Hebdige and Stuart Hall, their work has been limited to examining the rise and apparent decline of the subculture in England, rendering any further investigations into punk as looking back at a nostalgic novelty of post-World War II British milieu. Furthermore, the commodification of punk music and style has relegated punk to the realm of an alternative culture in Britain and locally in the U.S. In these current international incarnations, however, a social space for this alternative culture is threatened by severe punishment including what Indonesian police officials have label “moral rehabilitation” and, in the case of Russian punks, imprisonment. Punk today is once more—or, for the first time, truly becoming—an oppositional culture as described by Raymond Williams, rather than a non-threatening alternative.The international punk scene has become deeply connected to other punks through the internet, creating a growing global community. Through musical and stylistic culture, punk offers its members much more: a voice that questions established values, that screams for change. In these nations where punks have little agency in political and social matters, a guitar and a microphone offer a means of speaking. The communal aspect of punk creates an arena for those involved to foster a culture of dialogue and dissent",
