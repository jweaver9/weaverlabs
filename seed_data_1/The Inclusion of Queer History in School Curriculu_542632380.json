The Inclusion of Queer History in School Curriculum and its Influence on Students’WellbeingAn honors thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Honors in theDepartment of Elementary and Special Education.ByMaia StephensUnder the mentorship of Dr. Peggy Shannon-BakerABSTRACTThis study used a mixed methods approach to help determine how individuals worldwiderecall their history curriculum. The inclusion, if any, of queer historical figures wasdiscussed. The study’s aim was to discover any connection between the inclusion ofqueer historical figures and a potential increase to all students' well-being and academicgrowth. The study employed an initial survey as well as follow-up interviews todetermine the participants' education, experiences, and views of themselves at the time.The study concluded that the lack of inclusion of queer curriculum had a negative effecton students wellbeing and the potential inclusion of this curriculum could improve allstudents wellbeing.Thesis Mentor: Dr. Peggy Shannon-BakerHonors Dean: Dr. Steven EngelDecember 2022Department of Elementary and Special EducationHonors CollegeGeorgia Southern University2AcknowledgmentsI would like to express my gratitude to my mentor Dr. Peggy Shannon-Baker firstand foremost.

IntroductionWithin schools that cater to students aged 5 to age 18, there appears to be anationwide deficit within history courses with only six states in the US requiring thatschools include LGBTQ+ (queer) curricula (Prescott 2021). For the purpose of this study,queer history is defined as any historical event that was shaped by the contributions of aqueer individual, group, or organization. Additionally, the researcher will use the termsqueer and LGBTQ+ interchangeably for the purpose of this research. Oftentimes, historyclasses do not focus on the lives and contributions of queer figures who have shaped theworld as we know it. This spans from African rulers such as Njinga of Ndongo whofought Portuguese colonizers within her lands for over forty years to Alan Turing whosework helped develop the modern computer (Heywood, 2017; Kelkar, 2015). While someschools will scratch the surface of the contributions that queer individuals have made,there is a general lack of accurate and effective teaching about how these individualshave contributed to history (Coda et al., 2018). In recent years, more and more studentsfeel comfortable sharing their gender and sexual identities in school; this is the result ofworldwide changing attitudes toward queer individuals (Flores 2019).There is precedent within other marginalized groups that an increase inrepresentation in history classes can lead to an increase in student wellbeing (Kim 2016).Despite the precedent that has been set by increased education about other marginalizedgroups, there is limited conversation within the education world concerning teachingabout queer historical figures. Given this precedent and lack of teaching about queerhistories in educational settings, there could be an increase in the wellbeing of queer and4questioning students. However, this increase may only occur should schools beginacknowledging the queer identities of a variety of historical figures.Even with the possible benefit of improving student wellbeing, some woulddisagree with the addition of this content in schools. However, there has been precedentfor a desire to not include the histories of marginalized people in schools. The purposefulabsence of a marginalized group or group(s) has consistently and negatively impacted thewell-being of members of these groups (Damante, 2016). This study aims to examine theexperiences of queer and questioning individuals during their schooling and to examine ifthere is a relationship between student wellbeing and exposure to notable queer historicalfigures. For the purposes of this study, student well-being is defined as a student'sconfidence that their school environment makes them feel safe, healthy, and comfortableat all times that they are on school grounds (Democratic Schools for All, n.d.).Statement of the ProblemAs of May 2021, 69 countries criminalize homosexuality. Despite this, there isevidence of queer individuals worldwide and at nearly all recorded points in history.Research shows that including queer history and acknowledging the sexualities andgender identities of notable historical figures can potentially have a positive impact onthe school environment (Schey 2019). This study will examine the impact of theinclusion of queer history and notable historical figures in school curriculum with a focuson the well-being of queer students. By speaking with both queer and straight individualsabout their schooling experiences and how the history curricula impacted them, this studywill help to gain a better understanding of what inclusion of queer curricula currentlylooks like and what it may look like in the future.5Purpose StatementThis study addressed the lack of representation of queer historical figures inschool curriculums across the world. The purpose of this explanatory sequential mixedmethods study was twofold.  The first phase of the study was a qualitative exploration ofindividuals’ experiences in their schooling. The study focused on curriculum that taughtor mentioned queer historical figures; and whether their queerness was made explicit ornot; and how this inclusion or lack thereof impacted the individual’s wellbeing. Surveyswere collected from participants worldwide. From this initial exploration, the quantitativefindings were used to develop an interview feature that could be tested with a smallersample of survey participants.Research Questions1. How do people describe their experiences learning queer histories in school?2. How did the inclusion or exclusion of course materials on queer historiesinfluence their wellbeing?II. Literature ReviewThere were five general themes explored in the available literature: queerliterature in schools, political (re)actions to queer curriculum, queer pedagogy, queercurriculum, and media coverage of queer curriculum. It is important to note that theimpact of the inclusion of queer curriculum has only begun to be studied on a widespreadscale in recent history. Because of this, and in part due to the sensitive nature of thesubject, there is limited literature that looks at the student’s reaction to the introduction ofqueer literature.Queer Literature in Schools6This topic contains a synopsis of three scholarly articles examining the use ofqueer literature in both primary and secondary classrooms. Adam Crawley (2018) delvedinto the perspectives of parents in regard to the potential inclusion of queer picture booksin elementary schools. Crawley acknowledged that the question of allowing queer mediainto elementary classrooms is one that has been discussed before but often comes to astandstill when the potential backlash from parents is examined. The author discusseshow there are a variety of studies that examine the effect of queer literature in theclassroom, but there are not many studies that examine the response of parents to theinclusion of queer media in elementary classrooms. Crawley acknowledged the inclusionof parental concern that is in most studies concerning inclusive literature but feels thatthese brief mentions are not enough. Crawley’s study used eight parents who are eitherallies or queer themselves and while this population has a great deal to offer, it misses outon much of the nuance between allies and the staunchly unaccepting parents.The second article, also written by Crawley (2020), examined queer (specificallydealing with sexuality) picture book biographies and the level of representation withineach picture book. Crawley did this by choosing picture books where the subjects’ liveswere discussed rather than just their accomplishments in their respective fields.  Overall,Crawley ended up with fifty-one books which he examined with a focus on contentrelating to their sexuality. The books were chosen by first deciding who the biographyshould focus on, then Crawley looked at various online sellers, publishers, and databasesto find the books that were chosen. The content analysis revealed that there are threetypes of discussion of the subject's sexuality within the inclusive picture bookbiographies: explicit, implicit, and excluded. Crawley went on to detail the content of7each category with the explicit discussion of sexuality category only containing fivebooks while the implicit discussion of sexuality category contained nine books, and theexcluded discussion of sexuality category contained the remaining thirty-seven books.Crawley argued that the number of picture book biographies about queer individuals thatdo not mention their queerness help build a more heteronormative history than isaccurate. His conclusion helps impress the importance of the decisions made by authorsand illustrators of these picture books about the inclusion of queer history.The final article in this section by Ryan Schey (2019) explored the type of readingmaterial that students choose of their own free will. The study was conducted in a diversehigh school that had a Genders and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) club as well as policies thatprohibit discrimination and bullying. Despite these, there was notable intolerance forqueer students and parental unrest due to queer curricula. Schey studied one sophomoreEnglish class within the school that included independent reading as a part of the coursecurriculum. Those who chose to read queer content could not do so privately as they wererequired to read in class and occasionally discuss their novels in class. The study foundthat some students were wary of choosing certain texts because they would be targetedfor their open alliance and/or membership in the queer community. Within the classroom,the teacher used accepting language when discussing queer individuals and topics, andthe classroom library contained queer literature. The students noted that the queerphobiathat the general population of the school expressed made them hyperaware of thedecision to read a book that was openly queer. Queerphobia is defined as “a systemizeddiscrimination or antagonism directed against queer/LGBTQAIP+ persons” (Salem StateUniversity, 2021, para. 1). This dichotomy created a sense of isolation within the student8even as they were openly affirming the queer community. This isolation was the result ofbeing left exposed to bullying and harassment for their book choices. Schey concludedthat it requires more than simply having queer content available to students in EnglishLanguage Arts classrooms to help create affirming environments within schools.Political (Re)Action: Social Pressure and LegislationThis section consists of two articles and one book that explores the politicalreaction as well as legislation that has impacted the efforts to either include or block theinclusion of queer curriculum.The first article by Mark Villalpando (2018) discusses the impact of the Trumpadministration in relation to the LGBTQ+ (queer) community. He discussed how prior tohis election; former President Trump promised to be an ally to the queer community.Still, upon his election, he began enacting legislation that ultimately harmed the queercommunity. Villalpando compared the effects of the Obama and Trump administrations,specifically noting that much of the progress made under the Obama administration, waserased by the Trump administration. Common issues that queer individuals face were alsonoted with the most prominent being the struggles of dealing with queerphobia in aheteronormative world. Heteronormativity is the dominant belief that the “default”sexuality and gender identity that a given individual will be is both heterosexual andbinary or being a man or woman (Shannon-Baker, 2020). Villalpando stated that art canhelp queer individuals learn how to deal with this queerphobia. The benefits of having arteducation in schools are discussed and broken down into categories which include safespaces, identity affirmation, community-based activism, and building connections.Villalpando explained the impact that all of these things can have on queer students and9how they benefit the student’s wellbeing. Villalpando emphasizes the role that teachersplay in creating safe spaces can help minimize and mitigate the harassment and bullyingthat queer students face. Identity affirmation in the classroom is as simple asincorporating queer figures, artists, and identities into lessons and the effects of this canaid students in learning to accept themselves. This aspect of the classroom can also havea direct effect on students' ability to withstand ridicule against them for their queerness.Community-based activism has two major benefits: the ability for the student to buildconnections by becoming a part of their local community and explore new resources andsupport that they have as a part of the queer community in their area. Additionally, thisallows students to learn how to advocate and defend themselves in a real-world context.The article goes on to discuss how teachers can help create safe environments for queerstudents by being inclusive of queer people and the issues that they face as well asincluding queer content in the curricula, particularly queer role models.Steven Camicia’s (2020) book Critical Democratic Education andLGBTQ-Inclusive Curriculum: Opportunities and Cons takes a look at a variety of topicsconcerning the inclusion of queer curricula in schools. The first chapter discusses the rolethat schools play in democratic communities and how the curricula taught in schoolsdirectly impact the legitimacy of the school and the community at large. The secondchapter discusses the value of questioning public education at every stage in order toensure that all groups are equally and accurately represented in the curriculum. Camiciathen goes on to explore queer theory and how it relates to democratic education. The thirdand fourth chapters examine the social, political, and economical climates of Utah andCalifornia. Utah is home to the largest population of the United States’ Mormons and is a10state whose legislation reflects the generally conservative attitudes. Camicia highlightsthe way that religion and politics intersect in Utah and how this intersection conflicts withthe “unofficial curriculum” (pg. 29). The “unofficial curriculum” includes the things thatoccur outside of the curriculum whether this is an actual event or something that is taught(pg. 29). Within Utah, this unofficial curriculum is strictly monitored as evidenced by oneteacher who was prohibited from discussing her personal relationships both inside andoutside of school property. This directive was given after she told a student that she was alesbian when the student asked. While the teacher was able to fight the decision, she wasonly able to do so in court. The school's willingness to put a ban on her ability to discussher relationships highlights the political climate of Utah when it comes to both queercurriculum and individuals. California on the other hand has historically been one of thefirst states to introduce groundbreaking bills especially concerning queer issues.California’s history indicates that there is not a universal acceptance of queer teachers,curricula, or students as noted by the Briggs Initiative that proposed banning queerteachers from entering the public school system in California as well as prohibiting anykind of positive discussion surrounding queer topics in school (Camicia, 2020). Despitethis, California is still one of the few US states that have laws requiring that queer historybe taught. Camicia examines the differences in climate in both states before examiningthe school systems and legislation in place that deals with the inclusion of queerindividuals and topics in schools. In the fifth chapter, Camicia asserts that leaving queercontent out of the public school’s curriculum tells the students and the world thatmembers of the queer community are not only unimportant but also unnatural. He claims11that “legitimacy within a democracy is closely tied to the degree to which those who aregoverned are recognized in school policies and curriculum” (p. 74).The final article by Damon Huss and Tascha Folsoi (2018) examines the languageand impact of the FAIR (Fair, Accurate, Inclusive, and Respectful) Education Actlegislation passed in California in 2011. This act required that the history of marginalizedgroups, such as the queer community, be taught in social studies classes across California.The article discusses the various ways that the act will approach anti-discrimination aswell as the breakdown of how the new curricula will be taught for each grade (2-11). Thespecific language of the FAIR Act states the following:a study of the role and contributions of both men and women, Native Americans,African Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders,European Americans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans, personswith disabilities, and members of other ethnic and cultural groups, to theeconomic, political, and social development of California and the United States ofAmerica, with particular emphasis on portraying the role of these groups incontemporary society (Cal. Ed. Code § 51204.5).The article also provides some of the newly approved class resources that can helpsupport the new curricula as well as links and resources for teachers who may still havequestions about what is expected of them for the new curricula.Preparing Teachers for Queer CurriculumSteven Camicia (2020) defines curriculum as “a reflection of a system thatregulates what knowledge is deemed valuable and what knowledge is not” (p. 13).12In the first article, J. Tomkins, L.L. Kearns, and J. Mitton-Kükner (2018) explorehow pre-service teachers can be advocates for social justice using curricular action. Thestudy examines this through the use of Positive Space training. The Positive Spaceprogram was created to help ensure that queer community members had a place wherethey could feel safe, and it uses a feminist mindset to approach the issues that make queercommunity members feel unsafe. The Positive Space program (at the time the article waswritten) exists as a 2.5 hour workshop. The study focused on nine pre-service educatorsthat completed the Positive Space program and of the nine, five identified as LGBTQ+and four identified as allies and/or advocates for the LGBTQ+ community. Theparticipants were interviewed, and the study found that the candidates reported that afterthe training they felt more confident in their ability to call out and educate others aboutthe damage that can be done using harmful language. Additionally, candidates said thatusing small changes such as not gendering inanimate objects was a new goal forthemselves. Candidates said that they felt more prepared to fight to incorporate queersubject matter into the curricula despite reservations from teachers, parents, andadministration. The article concluded that pre-service teachers are capable, with propertraining, of challenging the status quo in curriculum practices and becoming social justiceadvocates for their students.Kedrick James’s (2019) Mapping Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI)Inclusion through Curriculum and Practice in a Canadian Teacher Education Programexamines the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) content inCanadian schools. The study noted that past research points to the conclusion thattraining teachers and teacher candidates to properly address SOGI issues in schools can13help minimize the amount of SOGI bullying that occurs in schools; however, the authornotes that in order to have an effective change, the training must also help create anenvironment in which teachers and students feel comfortable discussing issues openly.Interviews were conducted with Teachers Education for all (TEFA) faculty and staff.These interviews revealed that participants believed that language played a large role increating inclusive spaces and that teachers and teacher candidates needed to incorporateinclusive language in their vocabularies in order to be effective support systems forstudents. The study concludes that when teacher candidates have access to instructionthat allows for discussion about SOGI-related issues, students feel more capable ofdealing with SOGI issues in their classrooms when preparing to enter the field.Queer PedagogyThe two articles in this section examine the current pedagogy for teaching queercurricula as well as the need for a more defined queer pedagogy. Jeffrey Zacko-Smith andG. Pritchy Smith (2010) discuss the use of continually evolving curricula that reflectsocial change and strive to represent all of its students. The authors emphasize the needfor the curriculum and teachers to be open to change and accepting of different queerissues in order to help normalize these topics. The article then goes on to discuss thenegative effect that homophobia has on students and the impact that casual homophobiahas had on students. A new framework for education is proposed that included examiningthe lives and major struggles of the queer community and the intersection of race andsexuality. The article also explores the value of the everyday teacher having a basic graspof queer theory and using this theory when developing relevant lesson plans andclassroom activities. Ignoring homophobia and queerphobia in schools can cause a great14deal of harm. Zacko-Smith and Smith argue that it is necessary for teachers to have anunderstanding of Queer theory in order to help combat this harm. By incorporating QueerTheory into lesson planning, teachers can plan for and address some of the biases thatstudents have heard or developed and simultaneously provide accurate and effectiverepresentation. Overall, the article focuses on emphasizing the value of using classmaterials that are inclusive as well as having teachers that are inclusive in order to helpbegin the process of normalizing queer stories and histories in school.The second article by Deborah Britzman (1995) examined the need for queertheory to be a part of the core curricula. The author began by discussing major historicalevents such as the AIDS epidemic and the queer civil rights movement. Britzman thenwent on to discuss the meaning of Queer Theory and how it can have viewed as bothliteral and figurative regardless of how the person studying Queer Theory views themselfin terms of their sexuality. Britzman also explores the word queer and its unique historythat continues to spark debates about its use in academic and nonacademic spaces alike.The essay explores topics that impact how Queer Theory is perceived by the educationworld and how this impacts the inclusion of queer curriculum.  Britzman looks at theways that government information campaigns in the US provided a basis fordiscrimination against communities in which AIDS was predominantly found. Thecampaigns spread an “us versus them” mentality that allowed the everyday person toabsolve themselves of responsibility or guilt about the epidemic. Britzman (1995) arguesthat the idea that “information discourse, in and of itself, is anti-discriminatory” (pg. 12)is untrue and that ignorance, in fact, can stem from information discourse. Conversely,Brtizman also wars of ignorance that stem from consuming queer media as a way to15claim to understand the experiences of “the others.” In order to create a queer pedagogythat looks beyond the idea of us versus them, there must be a clear connection betweenthe obvious and nuanced nature of queer spaces, history, stories, and academia.MediaThis section contains brief descriptions of three news clips concerning theintroduction of queer content into the curriculum. The first news clip from 2017 exploresthe legal issues that arose when a Houston school attempted to incorporate queer historyinto the curriculum. A Texas state health and safety code required that schools teachstudents that “homosexual conduct” is considered criminal activity. This code remains ineffect as of June 2021 (KHOU 11, 2017).The second news clip from 2017 explores the requirement in California thathistory textbooks include mention of the sexual orientation and/or gender identity ofnotable historical figures. The authors of the textbooks note the issues with confidentlylabeling historical figures as queer without conclusive evidence (Fox News, 2017).The final video is a brief clip from 2019 that shows a debate among Londoncommunity members about the ethics of teaching queer history in schools. One motherhas withdrawn her child from a school that requires queer content to be taught to students(Christian Concern, 2019).SummaryThe inclusion of queer content in the school curriculum is a complex dilemmathat does not have a clear answer. Despite the precedent for discrimination against queerstudents, there is also a pattern in which education breeds tolerance (Sakallı et al., 2021).16When considering how tolerance can be incorporated into the classroom, queerliterature is an easily accessible option. Crawley (2018) looked at how parents wouldreact to the inclusion of queer literature in elementary classrooms and found that someparents were willing and eager for this inclusion. Crawley (2020) also researched whattypes of picture books were available for teachers to use in their classrooms and foundthat few picturebooks have explicit discussions of the queerness of various historicalfigures. Schey (2019) explored how the use of queer literature can be beneficial andaffirming but cannot be truly impactful unless there is a schoolwide culture of acceptancefor queer students and stories.While exploring the topic from a political standpoint, Villalpando (2018)discussed the influence that the Trump administration had in terms of passing harmfullegislation. This legislation limited the ability of schools to support queer students viasafe spaces, identity affirmation, community-based activism, and building connections.Camicia (2020) compared the social and political climates of California and Utahregarding queer curriculum. He noted a court case from Utah involving a teacher whowas queer and received backlash from both parents and the school district as a result.Huss and Folsoi (2018) offer insight on the FAIR act passed in California in 2011. Thisact effectively required that schools in California teach about marginalized historiesincluding queer history.It is necessary for teachers and preservice teachers to feel that they are equippedwith the necessary tools to teach the queer curriculum. Tompkins et al. (2018) found thatpreservice teachers feel more capable of being advocates for queer curriculum afterattending training to help them learn about the subject. James (2019) assessed teacher and17teacher candidates' feelings on teaching SOGI issues. He found that teachers feelprepared to teach and deal with SOGI issues in school when they have adequate trainingand resources to aid them.Zacko-Smith and Smith (2010) express the need for teachers to have a firm graspof queer theory. By understanding the mechanics of queer theory, they argue that teachersare able to create safe and effective learning environments. Britzman (1995) looks atwhat ignorance looks like when exploring queer pedagogy. She asserts that there must bea sort of order that queer pedagogy follows when exploring queer academia.The media coverage concerning parent reactions and legislature concerning queercurriculum in schools offers an accessible way for parents, teachers, and students to learnabout the attitudes and changes occurring in their local school districts and systems.Generally, there is a trend that education and inclusion allow for students andteachers to have positive experiences within schools. The research done on the impactsupportive educators who teach inclusive curriculum can have on the well-being ofstudents offers this study multiple avenues to explore when discussing what inclusionlooks like in the classroom as well as in the lives of students.III. MethodsResearch DesignThe research approach that best fit this endeavor was a mixed methods design.The data collected in a quantitative survey item provided insight into the second researchquestion; however, the first research question required further questioning that theinterview item provided.  Using a two-phase explanatory sequential design (e.g., Fisher et18al.), the researcher explored the experiences of international individuals’ schooling. Theresearch questions leading this study were:1. How do people describe their experiences learning queer histories in school?2. How did the inclusion or exclusion of course materials on queer historiesinfluence their wellbeing?Phase I: Quantitative Online SurveyThe recruitment process for the survey portion included using podcast listeners,members of various social media (Facebook and Twitter) platforms, and students atGeorgia Southern University. The survey was projected to receive approximately 50responses. The participants were limited to those over the age of 18 and they had to beable to speak English as all data collection was done in English.The data was collected in two parts. The first round of data collection was doneusing surveys; the survey was created and distributed using Qualtrics. The surveyscontained questions about the participant’s age, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation,location of schooling, and their thoughts on the curriculum during their primaryeducation. The surveys were collected and analyzed for any common trends and based onthe findings, willing participants were contacted for a follow-up interview.The instrumentation used to collect data was a survey containing open-endedquestions as well as follow-up interviews containing open-ended questions. The surveyand interview questions were created by the researcher and reviewed by the research’sadvisor in order to determine their accuracy and efficacy in determining the participant’sopinions concerning the research questions. The survey took approximately 5-7 minutesto complete and accept responses for three weeks. The surveys were shared through19social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. Additionally, the survey wasshared with listeners of queer history podcasts as well as students at Georgia SouthernUniversity. The survey served as a way to gain a broad understanding of the opinions ofthe participants about the inclusion of queer history in school curriculum and thefollow-up interviews provided more direct insight into the impact of the inclusion or lackthereof on the participant's wellbeing. The survey data was analyzed to determine theracial breakdown of the participants. The data was also examined to identify any trendsthat existed as well as any outliers such as participants that were noticeably older than theaverage age, participants that provided answers that did not follow the trends that wereidentified. These trends were discovered by isolating responses for each survey questionand creating visual and numerical representations of that specific data set.Phase II: Qualitative Individual InterviewsThe researcher used survey answers provided by participants as a starting pointfor the interviewee to elaborate on their opinions. The interview portion of the studyrecruited using survey participants. Interview participants were chosen based on severalcriteria including their age (in order to gain participants that span generational gaps) andlocation of schooling from ages 5 to 18. Additionally, participants included both queerand heterosexual/cisgender people. The interview portion’s goal was to includeapproximately 10 participants. Those who best fit the above criteria were selected for theinterview process. The interviews aimed to include both queer and cis individuals whoparticipated in the survey.Due to the international nature of the study, the interviews were conducted using avideo-telephony application such as Zoom. The interviews took approximately one to one20and one-half hours. The interviews were recorded for transcription later, and theparticipants were asked to further elaborate or explain the answers provided in the survey.Once the data from the interviews was collected, the data was analyzed again todetermine if the common trends remain and for the consensus of participants concerningthe inclusion of queer history in school curriculum. The interviews were transcribed, andthe transcriptions were used to analyze the data. The data main set of interview questionswere identified and isolated. Once this was completed, these responses were compared toone another to either affirm the trends found in the surveys or highlight any deviations.Finally, data was then organized into themes that were present across the interviews.IV. FindingsSurvey FindingsParticipant DemographicsThe survey portion of the data collection process provided demographic statisticssuch as racial, religious, gender identity, and sexual orientation makeup of theparticipants. The data indicated that most of the participants were white (see figure #below). Of the 13.4% of the participants who did not identify as white or caucasian,approximately half of them were mixed race. The remaining percentage was split amongthose who identified as Black (1.8%), Asian (1.2%), Hapa (0.6%), and of Europeandescent (0.6%).21Figure 1: Participant RaceParticipants were also asked to indicate their religion and while there were avariety of religions represented in the data, the majority (31.0%) of participants did notidentify any religious affiliation, and 34.5% of the participants identified as Atheists orAgnostic. Of the remaining participants, there were Christian, Pagan, and Jewish; of thesefour categories, the largest group were those who identified as Christian.Participant Survey ResponsesThe survey questions explored a specific aspect of the research questions drivingthis study. The first research question explored how people describe curricularexperiences learning queer histories in school. This question was used to frame the 11thand 13th survey questions which asked if participants were taught about queer historyand/or historical figures in their formal education and if participants believed that theinclusion of queer history can improve student understanding and engagement withhistory curriculum/courses respectively. The data for survey question 11 shows that only225.6% of survey participants had received any kind of education related to queer history intheir schooling (see Figure 3).Figure 2: [Were you taught about queer history and/or historical figures in your formaleducation?]Survey question 13 indicated that the majority of survey participants agreed thatthe inclusion of queer history in the school curriculum can improve student engagementand understanding of history courses and curriculum. Of the 179 responses, 10 weresomewhat disagreed and 2 were strongly disagree. The majority of participants (148)either strongly or somewhat agreed (see Figure 4).23Figure 3: [Do you believe that the inclusion of queer history can improve studentunderstanding and engagement with history curriculum/courses?]The second research question was addressed with survey questions 12 and 14.The research question aims to explore how did the inclusion or exclusion of coursematerials on queer histories influence participants’ wellbeing.  Survey question 12 askedparticipants whether or not they believe that their education about queer history/histories(or lack thereof) has impacted how they view the world. The majority of participants didnot believe that this was true with only 5.6% of participants indicating yes on their survey(see Figure 5).24Figure 4: [Do you believe your education about queer history/histories (or lack thereof)has impacted how you view the world?]Survey question 14 asked participants about their belief that the inclusion of queer historyin a formal educational setting can be beneficial to all students learning. Of the 179responses, 153 participants agreed. There was one participant who strongly disagreed,and six responses were neither agree nor disagree.Interview FindingsThe interview findings are organized thematically in order to accurately explorethe thoughts and feelings of the participants. There were four main themes that wereidentified and discussed: Aversion, Shame, Humanizing History, and Education forEveryone. Participants' names have been replaced with pseudonyms in order to protecttheir identities.Aversion: “It was frowned upon to be queer”When asked about their experiences with their schooling, most participants notedthat they had no experience within a classroom concerning queer historical figures.Participants stated that they were either entirely unaware of queerness in general or they25were aware of it but were never exposed to it in any positive fashion in the classroom.One participant (Alex) noted that while it was “not a secret” that queer people existed,there was no mention of their existence and contributions in schools. When asked abouttheir exposure to queer curriculum, Jane said “we didn't really discuss it in class. But itwas also, we still knew that it was like it was frowned upon to be queer.” This lack ofinclusion in schools led to participants having an aversion to queer people, identities, andthemselves. Within the bounds of the interviews, this theme highlights the way thatparticipants described feeling disgusted by queerness and took great care to avoid anysort of association with it. Without any accurate or positive representation within thecurriculum, participants were left to internalize the negative connotations associated withqueerness.Shame: “I don’t want to be that”The lack of education that many of the participants faced led to feelings ofconfusion, grief, and fear. Queer participants often expressed that they felt as if theycould not be themselves. The negative impact from the lack of education resulted inparticipants recalling experiences of alienation. Alex noted that they did not want to bequeer because queer people were “shunned by society, and I don't want to be that.” Janediscussed how this shame and fear lead to their assumptions that being queer “wasn'tacceptable. So it made it hard just trying to be myself”. The negative impact that the lackof curriculum about queer figures had on participants often resulted in lifelong strugglesabout their identities. Without access to this curriculum, participants were subjected tounnecessary and avoidable complications surrounding their identity.Humanizing history: “Queer people are just part of life”26When discussing the potential impact that inclusion of queer curriculum wouldhave, participants often noted that allowing this curriculum to exist within school systemswould be beneficial to students wellbeing. Daniel expressed that the causal inclusion ofthis curriculum would help “humanize[s] historical figures”. This inclusion would notaim to alter history but rather to add additional details to make history less of a fairytaleand more of a shared story. Daniel also stated that the inclusion of queer history in schoolcurriculum would be beneficial “so [sic] kids can grow up learning that [sic] queer peopleare just a part of life” When faced with the negative impacts that the lack of inclusion hascaused, the potential benefits of inclusion cannot be ignored. There are a variety of waysthat this inclusion can look, and most participants are in favor of a subtler approach.Education for everyone: “It would make a difference to all students”Participants generally expressed that they felt the inclusion of this curriculumwould not only be beneficial to potentially queer students but also to students that do notin any way identify with the LGBTQ+ community. Daniel stated that “...I think learningabout queer history will prepare [sic] heterosexual students for living in a world withpeople who aren't heterosexual”. Jane shared that they felt that this inclusion would bebeneficial to every student because “[Queer people have] always been around. I think itwould make a difference to all students, not just queer students, but all students”. Byeducating students about queer history regardless of their identity, students are no longerscandalized by the idea of queerness. This will prevent the levels of shame and isolationthat participants noted feeling in response to the lack of education. Alex shared that“there's already a lot of things in the curriculums that parents don't like, [sic] thequeerness is not as special, it should not be a special thing”. By reducing the stigma27surrounding queer education, schools help to prevent the detrimental impacts that thecurrent lack of education has on students.V. ConclusionThis study was designed in order to explore the connection between studentwellbeing and the inclusion of queer histories in the curriculum. The study used a mixedmethods approach that utilized a virtual survey followed by individual interviews. Basedon self-reported data, the study found that the current lack of inclusion of queercurriculum has a negative effect on student wellbeing and that the potential inclusion ofqueer history into school curriculum may have a positive impact on student wellbeing.Due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study wasconducted virtually. This limited the ability to create trust with participants concerningthe sensitive topic but did allow for participants that would not have otherwise beenaccessible to the study to participate.  Due to the virtual nature of the survey, there was anoverrepresentation of participants between 18-25. In the future, this can be avoided byhaving an in-person method of distributing the survey or by using recruiting methods thattarget older populations. Finally, the requirement that participants must be 18 years orolder to participate means that some participants may have a skewed view of theirschooling due to the time that has passed since.Additionally, some participants did not complete the entire survey. In the future,this can be avoided by requiring answers for specific questions before the survey can besubmitted. The inclusion of automated reminder emails to complete unfinished surveys28would have been beneficial in avoiding this situation as well. Limitations to this studyconcerning the follow-up interviews include potential hesitation on the participant’s partto be recorded given the sensitive nature of the topic. Additionally, due to the nature ofthe study, there is not a common state-mandated curriculum that can be analyzed andassessed.The findings from this study indicate that the inclusion of queer history in schoolcurriculum would have a positive impact on students wellbeing. The literature review forthis study indicated that there is a gap in education about queer historical figures(Crawley, 2020). By filling this gap, schools have the potential to improve the wellbeingof their students regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The literature reviewalso indicated that students are currently negatively impacted by the lack of educationabout queer people (Villalpando, 2018). The findings from this study support this andpropose that the solution to this negative impact is to provide students with a curriculumthat includes and embraces queer history.The implications of this study include the need for queer history to be a part of theschool curriculum. This inclusion can be a driving force in the improvement of studentwellbeing and provides the opportunity for queer students to be represented in schools ina way that does not currently widely exist. Beyond queer students, the study found thatthe added diversity in the curriculum can be beneficial to all students. Providing thiscurriculum to students offers them the opportunity to explore the diversity of the world ina learning environment and prepares them for the realities of the world they will one dayenter.29ReferencesBritzman, D.
