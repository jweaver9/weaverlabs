In Proceedings International Conference on Learning and Teaching (TIC 2008), Malaysia.            © Copyright 2008 (please consult author)   TIC 2008 Proceedings Embedding inclusivity in business curricula  Erica French, Paula McDonald Queensland University of Technology  Increasing workplace diversity, as well as requirements for committed and motivated workforces to operate within global markets, has brought renewed calls for fair inclusion and treatment of individuals. Business and education institutions are aware through anti-discrimination legislation that some practices in the workplace and classroom are unlawful because they directly or indirectly discriminate against some individuals or groups resulting in unfair treatment. The adoption of inclusive teaching and assessment practices offers one way of ensuring reasonable adjustment towards fair inclusive treatment. Further, an inclusive curriculum is recognised as encouraging an authentic learning process preparing individuals to lead and manage diverse workforces. The development of an inclusive curriculum within an Australian business faculty, while encouraged at a policy level, is implemented through voluntary means and in different ways across disciplines. This indicates a potentially amorphous outcome. This project investigates the extent to which gender and cultural issues are embedded into curricula (including books, cases, exercises and recent research). Content analysis of individual unit documents, interviews with faculty coordinators and a survey of unit coordinators were undertaken. Findings show the inclusion of equity issues is reasonably comprehensive, though some variation across units was evident. Further, the decision to include equity issues was associated with specific unit topics, more than the personal preferences of the unit coordinator. In units where equity issues were limited, this was often justified as an issue of unit size, amount of material needing to be covered and/or the scope of the unit.   Keywords: Equity, inclusion, business, curriculum.  Introduction  Cultural differences, gender, variations in age and physical ability, and other individual attributes can play a significant role in a student’s perception of equitable treatment and affect their ability to engage in learning opportunities. The concept of equity within curricula recognises the importance of individual difference and how relations of power and inclusion can affect learning outcomes. From an institutional perspective this necessitates a commitment to equity through the eradication of sexism, racism, classism, ageism, homophobia etc throughout the curriculum, access, climate and other educational practices (Dei and James, 2002). Research shows that student participation in diversity education activities and cross cultural dialogue experiences, leads to positive, immediate and long term personal, academic and professional growth (Milem and Hakuta 2000).   The incorporation of gender and diversity issues into university curricula has received some attention in the academic literature (see McKeen and Burke 1991; 2000). However, studies addressing diversity in teaching and learning have tended to focus on how education strategies differentially affect students from diverse backgrounds, rather than curriculum content specifically. Both corporations and graduates perceive a role for university-based initiatives in addressing the chilly climate for women and minorities (which in corporations is manifested in the “glass ceiling”; Hite and McDonald, 1995) and educating future management graduates about gender and other diversity issues (McKeen, Bujaki and Burke 2000). Larkin and Staton (2001) offer a useful framework for conceptualising equity designed around four components: access, inclusion, climate and empowerment. The four components of Larkin and Staton’s (2001) framework are defined as:   1. Access. Ensuring equal access to educational resources and opportunities and encouraging students to consider non-traditional areas of study.   2. Inclusion. Examining bias in teaching and learning materials in terms of inclusive language, content, and pedagogical practices.  3. Climate. Creating an educational atmosphere that is safe and supports equity and deals with harassment and violence.  1  TIC 2008 Proceedings 4. Empowerment. Involving students in the process of social change and taking a social action approach to education.  However, Larkin and Staton (2001) acknowledge the difficulty in institutionalising equity in business curriculum when the interests of large corporations and current market forces often take priority. Equity issues are frequently lost in rapidly changing, market driven curriculum and changing requirements for student assessment. Larkin and Staton 2001, also argue that market forces have the potential to suppress diversity in teaching and learning and produce new forms of inequities through the push to treat everyone the same.   The element of inclusion in Larkin and Staton’s (2001) equity model is particularly relevant to our study; particularly as it relates to the business curricula in a large Australian university (the university). This includes factors that overcome bias in teaching and learning materials, by encouraging inclusive language, inclusive content and pedagogical practices that recognise and acknowledge a wide variety of difference in learning opportunities (Larkin and Staton 2001). Mills (1997) argues that inclusive content also involves the use of books, cases, exercises, and the presentation of research that includes gender, culture and other issues to understand that there are competing paradigms within business. Two other elements of Larkin and Staton’s (2001) model, ‘access’ and ‘climate’, have been extensively adopted throughout faculty policies encouraging equal access to resources and opportunities and a safe environment that supports equity. The final element, ‘empowerment’ is beyond the scope of this study but future research could usefully address how social action and change could enhance broader notions of equity. Hence, the project seeks to examine equity through an inclusion lens, to identify the implementation of various activities.  Inclusive curricula in a practice sense apply the principles of “universal design”. This is an approach to designing course instruction, materials, and content to benefit a variety of people with a range of learning styles and life experiences, removing the need, as far as possible, to make alterations to delivery and assessment for different individual during the semester. When a course is designed with universal design principles in mind, it meets the following criteria:   • The essential components of the course are clearly defined.  • Prerequisite courses, knowledge and skills are identified.  • Expectations are communicated clearly.  • The physical environment is accessible and conducive to learning.  • The climate encourages and supports interaction.  • Instructional methods recognise student diversity.  • Technology enhances instruction and increases accessibility.  • A variety of mechanisms for demonstrating knowledge are available. • Feedback is clear, prompt, and frequent.  The aim of inclusive curricula is to embed appropriate and diverse practices in a course from the beginning, reducing the need for students to highlight their “difference” by requesting special arrangements. Inclusive curriculum design assumes a diverse student population and responds to that challenge. The principle of inclusive design is equal access to learning opportunities, rather than simply equal access to information. It provides a diverse student body with multiple means of representation, expression and engagement (Transforming Education for Universal Design for Learning website). Inclusive design does not remove academic challenges. Rather, it removes barriers to access and is a best practice approach that benefits all students.   Under its equal opportunity policy the university aims to provide equal employment and educational opportunities and identify and remove barriers to participation and progression in employment and education. To encourage this outcome, the university supports a number of equity policies that promote an inclusive culture. While documented at a policy level, inclusion is implemented through the voluntary efforts of individual academics across different disciplines. Voluntarism of implementation can result in a potentially amorphous outcome.   This study identified and examined the processes, activities and resources utilised to encourage diverse representation, expression and engagement of students in the undergraduate courses offered within the Faculty of Business. The project was financially supported by the Faculty Equity Committee and contributes to the equity goals of the Faculty. This benchmarking has not been attempted in the Faculty previously and provides a robust measure of the types of equity initiatives currently implemented, but which hitherto have been largely invisible. The results provide an empirical basis for future equity and diversity strategies within the Faculty, 2  TIC 2008 Proceedings particularly those related to inclusivity throughout curricula. The project is limited to under-graduate units and could be extended to post-graduate units in future research.   Methods   The data collection for the project included three phases consisting of analysis of unit documents; a survey of unit coordinators and interviews with faculty core unit coordinators.   Phase 1: Analysis of Formal Unit Documents   The first phase of the research provided an opportunity to investigate the nature of the content of unit documents to identify representation and expressions of inclusivity. Two documents and each unit’s website from each of the 104 units offered in 2006 were examined. Units investigated were derived from the School of Accountancy (n=15); School of Economics and Finance (n=19); International Business (n=16); School of Management (n=23); and School of Advertising/ Marketing/ Public Relations (n=31).   Phase 2: Survey of Unit Coordinators  The second phase of the research investigated the nature of inclusive curricula in more detail. As well as identifying representation and expressions of inclusivity through content this study explored opportunities of variety in engagement through the range of teaching and learning approaches utilising inclusive content. A survey was designed with broad categories and open ended questions to gather maximum data (see appendix one). Seventy five staff coordinating 96 under-graduate units (the 104 total units less 8 faculty core units) were emailed a short questionnaire and asked to participate in the study. Twenty-two surveys were returned (response rate 29.3%). Five participants answered ‘not applicable’ across all categories within the survey, four of whom were from the School of Accountancy and one from the School of Economics and Finance.   Phase 3: Interviews with Faculty Core Unit Coordinators  The third study allowed for greater exploration into more than the content and process areas of inclusivity within the curricula. Interviews with the eight unit coordinators of the faculty core units were undertaken (6 men, 2 women). These interviews identified barriers and supports for change in incorporating equity measures through inclusive curricula. All interviews were conducted by one research assistant allowing for consistency of procedure, approach and content. Participants were provided with information regarding the objectives of the interview questions a priori, were assured that their responses would be confidential and all gave permission for interviews to be tape recorded and for results to be compiled at group level.   Measures and Analysis   Phase 1  A content analysis approach was taken where data were examined to identify information relevant to 10 categories of inclusion and expressions of inclusivity. Nine categories were derived from explicit equity policy areas: gender (sex, pregnancy, marital status); culture (internationalisation and ethnic and indigenous diversity); disability; age; low socio economic status/poverty; non English-speaking background; rural/isolated; religion; and LGBTQ issues. A tenth category, class, was included as it has been identified as a critical area of concern in the equity literature. A unit outline document identifies the synopsis of the unit, required and recommended readings, prerequisites, unit aims and objectives and assessment. A week one document identifies the unit in more detail including objectives, graduate capabilities, and detailed content and assessment requirements. Content OLT sites included teaching materials, assessment and prescribed and recommended resources. The results were mapped according to representation across groups of units.  Phase 2   A thematic analysis of responses to open ended survey questions was undertaken to identify not only the inclusive representation and expression opportunities in each unit, but also the means of engagement used, including cases, texts, lecture material and assessment etc. Questions were few and relatively structured. For example, participants were asked to indicate which (if any) of the equity categories (e.g., gender, culture, disability, low socio economic, sexual orientation and so on) were included in their unit curriculum and to describe the types of teaching/learning activities associated with the unit. Respondents were asked to include 3  TIC 2008 Proceedings any content or pedagogical practices which contribute to student understanding of diversity and/or equity, in a broad sense. Respondents were also asked to describe the teaching/learning activities, readings, multi-media approaches, guest lecturers, text books, lecture material areas, assessment and other pedagogical practice contributing to inclusion. The results were mapped according the means of engagement across groups of units.  Phase 3  A thematic analysis of interview responses incorporating the specified categories was undertaken to explain and examine representation, expression and engagement activities as well as barriers and recommendations. Respondents were asked about the content and practice of inclusivity. Respondents were also invited to discuss perceptions of the appropriateness of including equity issues in the curriculum and obstacles and difficulties of developing inclusive curricula, as well as strategies for overcoming those difficulties. The format for the interviews was semi-structured, allowing for several a priori themes to be explored with flexibility for other issues to arise and be discussed. Results were mapped according to the themes.  Strengths and Limitations of the Study  While the findings which follow offer a strong empirical basis for future equity and diversity strategies within the Faculty, particularly those related to inclusion throughout curricula, the results of the study will also be useful for reporting Faculty activities internally and for promoting equity objectives to external audiences. Although the project is limited to under-graduate units the scope for this kind of benchmarking could be extended to post-graduate units in future research. Further, this study did not investigate the student experience of inclusion. Additional investigation is needed to understand the student perception of inclusion in practice.   Findings   Phase 1: Analysis of Formal Unit Documents  1. Gender (sex, pregnancy, marital status). Unit documentation across the faculty only minimally acknowledged issues of gender in business, with most comments being general in nature such as requiring students to display sensitivity in addressing gender and cultural issues. Few units mentioned specific, core gender issues such as stereotyping or responsible representation and these were principally in units related to the soft skills of business rather than the technical or operational or systems units.  2. Culture (including internationalisation and globalisation and ethnic and indigenous diversity). Unit documentation across all schools in the faculty extensively refers to culture. However, culture was most commonly represented in the context of internationalisation and globalisation. Some units (fewer in number that those addressing culture related to internationalisation) addressed culture as the recognition of individual or group background, including ‘ethnic diversity’ and indigenous issues. In contrast with cultural perspectives addressing internationalisation and globalisation, the inclusion of culture as an influence on attitudes and behaviour was less prominent and varied more markedly across the schools. The international business units were the most active in embedding these constructs throughout their documentation. The international business units also document indigenous Australia and associated struggles for inclusion in Australian economic and political institutions. Units in the management area acknowledge the need for sensitivity and commitment to better understanding cultural and gender issues. Units in the marketing area refer to cultural influences on consumers; responsible representation; stereotyping; ethnicity and gender. Accountancy includes a unit that documents cultural influences on accounting development in a global context and students study cultural characteristics of chosen countries and reflect on the relationship between culture and accounting practices internationally.  3. Disability, Age, Class, Low Socio Economic Status, Non English Speaking Background; Poverty; Rural/Isolated persons; religion and Lesbian, Gay, Bi-Sexual, Transsexual and Queer persons. The extent to which other diversity issues were embedded in unit documentation was less evident. The economics area identified issues related to poverty through aspects of unemployment and inflation, consumer choice in education, population ageing and its impact on productivity. International business units focused on providing a practical understanding of Australian demography, political circumstances, social and cultural considerations, government, legal and the regulatory environment. Management units included equity and related issues within lecture topics, stated aims and rationales and assessment items. Utilitarianism and non-union workplaces were discussed as well as pluralism and union workplaces. Issues regarding equity, wages, enterprise bargaining, competition versus work/life balance were also highlighted. Advertising units included lecture topics on targeting specific audiences and interest groups, the internet effects on behaviour, marketing to children, responsible representation, stereotyping, ethnicity and gender, 4  TIC 2008 Proceedings creative social responsibility - from social marketing to culture jamming, environmental analysis, how to handle different types of customers and social ethical and legal responsibilities. Accountancy units discussed issues regarding social responsibility in reporting and minority interest groups within intra group transactions.   Phase 2: Survey of Faculty of Business undergraduate Unit Coordinators  Respondents from the School of Management area and School of Economics and Finance acknowledged that gender issues were included in the curricula. Management respondents identified a more explicit inclusion across units while the economics respondents recognised a more general approach. Cultural issues were addressed to a greater extent than gender issues by all respondents, who acknowledged incorporating international, cross cultural and cultural relativity cases and activities. The diverse cultural backgrounds of the tutors in some units were also reported. Respondents indicated a range of teaching and learning approaches used to support inclusivity including:   Examples of gender based case studies included addressing general discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. Examples of culture based case studies were extensive with most addressing internationalisation and fewer addressing cultural inclusivity. Respondents from Management reported using case studies to address other areas including low socio-economic issues; negotiation issues and low socio economic status as well as the consideration of issues and application to theory on topics such as sexual orientation, age discrimination, disability, equal employment opportunities and equal pay. A broad range of readings were used across all equity categories. Other readings focused on international issues such as culture, the nature of equity generally and papers on work/family balance.  Multimedia examples included a video on female leaders and gender differences in leadership styles and a DVD which focused on occupational health and safety and women; migrant occupational health and safety and worker’s compensation issues. Most respondents reported using male and female guest lecturers, lecturers and tutors and invited international visitors. Topics included discussing the changing participation rates of women and other employee groups including migrants and mature age workers, and how flexibility in the workplace is sought for women but that there is a need to provide a culture that allows improved access for individuals. Respondents reported including chapters and sections of chapters with a specific gender focus as well as additional readings/research specifically related to this topic. Topics included gender differences in organisational behaviour such as leadership and social support, barriers faced by minority groups such as women, and legal issues relating to diversity. Some respondents reported linking theory to practice by accessing case scenarios within the text. Lecture content broadly identified numerous areas, perspectives and empirical research on both gender and cultural influences in the workplace. One participant reported that, on reflection, there had been no reference made to indigenous issues and that this could be changed for future content. With regard to other groups in the workplace the coverage was less extensive but examples included discussion on equity and diversity generally, stereotyping and bias as well as discussions on wages relating to individual bargaining and workers compensation.   Phase 3: Interviews with all Business Core Unit Coordinators  1. Equity content. Interview data derived from the eight coordinators of core units in the Faculty revealed business units vary greatly in the extent to which they cover equity issues. Equity issues were predominantly covered within lecture material and in some cases followed up with examples in tutorials, linking theory to practice. One unit used examples of equity issues in tutorials through the use of current affairs. Two units incorporated equity issues within assessment items and one unit made reference to equity issues in their unit outline within their graduate capabilities program. Three models of inclusivity in content were evident.  a. Specific Focus. Four units identified that their focus on inclusivity is through specific topic areas dealing with aspects from ethical and legal responsibilities and corporate governance; individualism, capitalism, socialism and a wide range of social policies and their effects diverse groups including women, migrants and disability services; industrial relations and gender pay equity and the treatment of those who are employed in casual arrangements. These units also described their portrayal of Australia as an ethnically diverse and pluralist country exploring impacts on policy and practice. Topics identified also include content on ignominious outcomes due to ignorance of differences.   b. General Edge. Three units did not specifically incorporate equity issues within unit content. These units were those classed as technically-oriented. Coordinators of these units mentioned that they seek equity through their 5  TIC 2008 Proceedings use of gender and culture in specific examples. However they do not use the term equity or refer specifically to equity issues.   c. Evasion. One unit does not specifically refer to equity, but as issues arise within unit content relating to particular rights or duties in race and gender discrimination, the matters are discussed broadly.   2. Teaching strategies for diverse students. The process of inclusion through different teaching strategies was sporadic; at best strategic and at worst, piecemeal. One unit coordinator utilised audiovisual and multimedia methods and data streaming on their web site. Reports indicate the online tutorials have proved very successful and popular. The multi-version mode of production of these materials (with text, with no text and with captions) allows use by the hearing impaired, benefits international students who often have difficulty understanding the Australian accent and ensures remote access for people with work and family responsibilities.   3. Perceived appropriateness of including equity issues. Coordinators differed in their responses regarding the appropriateness of covering equity issues within their unit. Responses were related to the model of content inclusion. For example, units with a specific focus approach saw equity as an integral and imperative part of their curriculum. Coordinators of units taking a general edge approach or evasion approach to equity in the curricula did not perceive these issues as being an appropriate focus for their unit content.   4. Perceived barriers to including equity content. Three unit coordinators reported no barriers in including equity content into teaching while the remaining five discussed a number of factors which impacted on their ability to include equity content in their units. One coordinator highlighted that students predominantly tend to come from a very privileged group and that the student cohort itself is atypical in terms of community and society. The coordinator felt unsure about the students’ relationship to real poverty therefore affecting decisions to include equity issues generally.   5. Difficulties experienced in incorporating inclusive practices. A number of issues causing significant frustration were raised. In terms of their own personal delivery or teaching philosophy, most coordinators felt confident in their approach regarding inclusive practices, though level of confidence appeared to be relative to length of teaching experience. Coordinators identified many international students were reluctant to engage in discussion due to cultural or language barriers. It was thought tutors, in the main, are conscious of this problem and strategies to deal with it are discussed at tutor meetings. One coordinator noted that cultural sensitivity was a key factor in teaching a lecture to large classes (300-500 students) and that it was difficult to ensure that all students understand a particular concept. Diminishing funds and resources were raised as another problem in designing and implementing inclusive curricula. Coordinators expressed frustration in searching for other sources of funding to help minority or international students.   6. Strategies to increase the level of inclusive curriculum. Suggestions included the introduction of scholarships specifically targeted at marginalised students to address the need for a more diverse cohort. It was also thought that a move towards utilising more case studies in some units could also be useful in establishing greater inclusion of equity issues in core units. Another suggestion was to conduct complementary tutorials at a faculty level where specific skills are addressed, for example presentation and other generic skills students are lacking. One coordinator reported endeavouring to implement strategies at a faculty level to improve the teaching in the area of business communication. Another coordinator had successfully applied for an equity grant which was used to employ extra teachers to run complementary tutorials for students requiring additional assistance. Other strategies reported to be helpful included training sessions for tutors to ensure high levels of student participation, education in using gender and culturally neutral language and presentation of material in an objective manner. One coordinator reported a number of strategies to encourage interactivity including the use of a radio frequency transmitter in lectures where questions covering material are provided and students can key in an answer. Another equity-promoting strategy suggested was to stage an event for female business students where equity could be celebrated. Students would be invited to these events and be provided with an opportunity to network and establish mentors within their area of interest. Employing tutors who were more accustomed to teaching students with special needs (e.g., blind or disabled) was also reported as a suggested strategy.   Discussion  The introduction of equity measures for inclusive curricula in the Faculty of Business is essentially voluntary and individualistic, resulting in a patchy coverage of equity representation and opportunities for expression and engagement. Faculty involvement in inclusive curricula remains in many cases disconnected to the individual 6  TIC 2008 Proceedings efforts of lecturers and tutors. While some lecturers identified that equity was not a focus in the curricula, many acknowledged its importance and inclusion.   Representation There is a substantial number of relevant equity categories representing a wide range of difference included throughout the content areas of most units in the undergraduate degree. This representation appears reasonably comprehensive throughout the areas of documentation and web sites but is more limited in the assessment arena. A few coordinators identified that they believed representation was not applicable to some discipline based areas of instruction in business. Obvious pockets of inclusion were identified that are wide ranging while others substantially less so, particularly in the area of gender and cultural diversity and particular to those technical areas of instruction in business. Further, three different perspectives were identified in addressing equity through inclusive practice in content areas that demonstrates a lack of consistency across the Faculty, namely specific inclusion (explicit reference to equity topic areas across knowledge skills and abilities arenas); general inclusion (broad reference to equity topic areas in the context of other issues) and evasion (no reference unless the topic is raised by others). The inclusion of representative categories in content seems to be associated with particular disciplines and particular unit topics and not to personal preference, with explanations referring to limitations of issues such as unit size, amount of material to be covered and limited scope for interactive formats. While personal preference may not be an explicit issue, a lack of knowledge, awareness and understanding of equity issues and strategies for inclusiveness appears to be an influencing factor.   Expression and Engagement There is a wide range of teaching and learning approaches utilised for encouraging individual expression and student engagement related to inclusive activities undertaken. Case studies and experiential activities are well utilised to engage students and provide opportunities for individual expression through a range of modes and an array of assessment types appropriate to inclusivity. However these seem to be substantially located in content areas deemed as most applicable for these types of activities rather than extensively located throughout the curriculum. Technology is less well developed as a tool for increasing inclusivity in practice.  Barriers and Support There is general recognition that development of inclusive curricula is complex, with Faculty support warranted to overcome the current disconnect between Faculty initiatives and unit coordinators’ implementation efforts. Many effective initiatives developed and utilised at an individual level remain unrecognised and many are not sustained in the longer term without individual agents’ of support. There is limited means or practices for recognising and sharing the knowledge of effective practice in inclusive curricula. Various and disparate levels of knowledge and competence in what constitutes inclusive practice at a student level are also identified as potentially limiting the experiences offered through inclusive practice in the programs offered. Finally, the infusion of equity measures through curricula in an open and transparent manner is not well linked throughout faculty staff, the student body and the community.   Conclusion  It is recommended that the Faculty consider inclusion principles from four perspectives. The first is through the perspective of the student experience. Further research with undergraduate students will assist in clarifying the needs specific to the student body. A number of tactics could be utilised to infuse inclusive practice such as complementary tutorials and dedicated assistance and consultation times for vulnerable students or students in need. Access to information from past students through orientation programs or promotional functions could assist with building a broader student understanding of inclusive practice and its benefits. The second perspective from which the Faculty could consider inclusion principles is through support for staff initiatives and staff development. Recognition for effective inclusive practices through staff awards and the promotion of best practice through multi-media avenues including blackboard; websites; staff training processes; newsletters; etc., would encourage the infusion of inclusive practice into every day occurrences. Support services through a specialist advisor skilled in new technology to assist staff to encourage a strong take up and effective use of technology as a means of utilising practices in inclusive curricula implementation such as Blackboard, interactive PowerPoint presentations and podcasting would encourage not only a culture change but also address the lack of knowledge of staff with new technology. Support for inclusive curricula design through learning design assistance and training opportunities will further ensure individual knowledge development for staff. A third area of consideration is through encouraging broader faculty and school commitment. Subject area coordinators and heads of schools could engage in inclusion strategies through better knowledge management and information sharing of equity matters determined at Faculty level, such as equity bursary recipients. Each school and/or subject area could be encouraged to provide additional support to bursary recipients from their area, through local equity programs that could supplement bursaries with such items as free copies of recommended text books, access to support tutoring, photocopy support, or other services as identified by the 7  TIC 2008 Proceedings 8 schools and through the students needs analysis. These schools and areas can also be encouraged to support individual successes in inclusive curricula design and implementation. The fourth area involves building inclusivity links between staff, students and the community. Special events that include community and business institutions as sponsors, mentors and/or contributors would provide an opportunity to encourage a broader engagement strategy that infuses inclusion into everyday practice and decision-making.

    "abstract": "Increasing workplace diversity, as well as requirements for committed and motivated workforces to operate within global markets, has brought renewed calls for fair inclusion and treatment of individuals. Business and education institutions are aware through anti-discrimination legislation that some practices in the workplace and classroom are unlawful because they directly or indirectly discriminate against some individuals or groups resulting in unfair treatment. The adoption of inclusive teaching and assessment practices offers one way of ensuring reasonable adjustment towards fair inclusive treatment. Further, an inclusive curriculum is recognised as encouraging an authentic learning process preparing individuals to lead and manage diverse workforces. The development of an inclusive curriculum within an Australian business faculty, while encouraged at a policy level, is implemented through voluntary means and in different ways across disciplines. This indicates a potentially amorphous outcome. This project investigates the extent to which gender and cultural issues are embedded into curricula (including books, cases, exercises and recent research). Content analysis of individual unit documents, interviews with faculty coordinators and a survey of unit coordinators were undertaken. Findings show the inclusion of equity issues is reasonably comprehensive, though some variation across units was evident. Further, the decision to include equity issues was associated with specific unit topics, more than the personal preferences of the unit coordinator. In units where equity issues were limited, this was often justified as an issue of unit size, amount of material needing to be covered and/or the scope of the unit",
