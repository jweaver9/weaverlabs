Edwards • Kateryna M. SylaskaReceived: 18 September 2012 / Accepted: 27 November 2012 / Published online: 12 December 2012\u0002 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012Abstract Preliminary research suggests that partner vio-lence is a problem among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) college youth. However,there is no study to date with college youth on the factorsassociated with perpetration of same-sex partner violence,which is needed to inform prevention efforts specific to thispopulation. Thus, the purpose of the current study was toassess how facets of minority stress (i.e., sexual-orientation-related victimization, sexual minority stigma, internalizedhomonegativity, sexual identity concealment) relate tophysical, sexual, and psychological partner violence perpe-tration among LGBTQ college youth (N = 391; 49 %identified as men; 72 % Caucasian; M age: 20.77 years). Atthe bivariate level, physical perpetration was related toidentity concealment and internalized homonegativity; sex-ual perpetration was related to internalized homonegativity;and psychological perpetration was related to sexual-orien-tation-related victimization. However, at the multivariatelevel (after controlling for concurrent victimization), psy-chological perpetration was unrelated to minority stressvariables, whereas physical and sexual perpetration wereboth related to internalized homonegativity; physical per-petration was also related to identity concealment. Theseresults underscore the utility of understanding partner vio-lence among LGBTQ youth through a minority stressframework. Moreover, the current study highlights the needfor a better understanding of factors that mediate and mod-erate the relationship between minority stress and partnerviolence perpetration among LGBTQ youth in order toinform prevention and intervention efforts.Keywords Dating violence \u0002 Sexual minority \u0002Gay/lesbian/bisexual \u0002 Minority stress \u0002 InternalizedhomonegativityIntroduction: Literature Review and Study RationalePartner violence, which includes physical, psychological,and sexual violence towards one’s partner, is an endemicproblem in US society, especially college youth. Althoughthe vast majority of the research literature has focused onpartner violence among heterosexual youth, there has beena growing focus on partner violence among lesbian, gay,bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ)youth. In a nationally representative sample of high schoolstudents reporting only romantic partners of the same sex,21 % indicated that they had experienced psychologicalpartner violence victimization within same sex relation-ships and 24 % reported physical partner violence victim-ization within same-sex relationships (Halpern et al. 2004).Moreover, in a sample of college students, Porter andWilliams (2011) found that being a sexual minorityincreased one’s risk for experiencing physical, sexual, andpsychological same-sex partner violence victimization. Inthe only published study to assess same-sex perpetration ofpartner violence among youth, Jones and Raghavan (2012)reported that 43.5 % of LGBTQ college students reporteddating violence perpetration within the past 12 months.Despite preliminary work documenting the rates of partnerviolence among LGBTQ youth, there is no research to datethat has focused specifically and comprehensively on therates and correlates of same-sex partner violence perpe-tration among college students. Having a better under-standing of the rates of same-sex partner violenceperpetration and the factors that increase LGBTQ youth’sK. M. Edwards (&) \u0002 K. M.

Thus, the purpose of the study wasto explore this gap in the literature using a minority stressframework (Lewis et al. 2012).A number of different theories (e.g., sociocultural theo-ries, social learning theories, personality theories) have beenused to explain correlates and predictors of partner violenceperpetration among heterosexual youth with modest success(see Dardis et al. 2012 for a review). Although it is likely thata number of the more consistent factors associated withpartner violence perpetration among heterosexual youth(e.g., co-occurrence of partner’s perpetration, substance use,experiencing physical or sexual abuse as a child, witnessingpartner violence between parents; see Dardis et al. 2012 for areview) would also explain partner violence perpetrationamong LGBTQ youth, it is also likely that LGBTQ youthexperience additional factors related to their sexual minorityidentity. Thus, a theory or framework that recognizes themarginalization and subjugation of LGBTQ individuals maybe especially helpful in understanding same-sex partnerviolence perpetration (Brown 2008). One such theory isdisempowerment theory (Archer 1994; McKenry et al. 2006)and the related construct of sexual minority stress, which hasbeen defined as ‘‘a multifaceted construct that includesexperiences specifically related to one’s sexual minoritystatus such as: identity concealment and confusion; experi-enced and anticipated rejection, victimization anddiscrimination; and internalized homonegativity/sexual self-stigma’’ (Lewis et al. 2012, p. 251).In the current study, we measured both externalizedminority stressors (i.e., general sexual-orientation-relatedvictimization, perception of prejudice or discriminationtowards LGBTQ persons) and internalized minoritystressors (i.e., internalized homonegativity, identity con-cealment) as risk factors for perpetration of same-sexpartner violence. Sexual-orientation-related victimizationincludes verbal harassment, threats, and physical abuse/assault victimization on the basis of the victim’s sexualorientation and has been reported by 77, 27, and 8 % ofLGBTQ college youth, respectively (D’Augelli 1992).Internalized minority stress includes internalized homo-negativity (i.e., negative attitudes toward the self based onsocial stigma) and identity concealment (i.e., hiding one’ssexual identity from others) (Lewis et al. 2012). Althoughresearch suggests that, on average, youth report low tomoderate levels of internalized homonegativity and iden-tity concealment, greater levels of these stressors arerelated to a number of deleterious psychosocial healthoutcomes (Cox et al. 2011; Mohr and Daly 2008).Researchers have hypothesized that minority stressincreases an individual’s likelihood of perpetrating same-sex partner violence (Brown 2008; Lewis et al. 2012;McKenry et al. 2006). Given the early stages of this area ofresearch, the mechanisms through which minority stressincreases the likelihood of perpetrating same-sex partnerabuse is unclear. However, according to disempowermenttheory, individuals who feel inadequate and lack self-effi-ciency are at increased risk of using nontraditional meansof power assertion, such as violence (Archer 1994;McKenry et al. 2006). Extending this theory to same-sexpartner violence, LGBTQ youth who feel high levels ofinadequacy and powerlessness, may be more likely toengage in aggression towards a same-sex partner. More-over, minority stress experiences are associated with psy-chological and relational variables such as depression,substance use, and low relationship quality (Frost andMeyer 2009; Hatzenbuehler 2009; McKenry et al. 2006),all of which are also risk factors for perpetrating partnerviolence (Dardis et al. 2012; Balsam and Szymanski 2005;Murry et al. 2001).Although there is a theoretical basis to expect a rela-tionship between sexual minority stress and the perpetra-tion of partner violence, there are only a few empiricalstudies on this topic. In a recent focus-group study withLGBTQ college youth on perceptions of same-sex partnerviolence, a central theme to emerge was the role of societaland internalized homonegativity as a contributor to per-petration of same-sex partner violence (Gillum andDiFulvio 2012). Although Gillum and DiFulvio (2012) didnot directly test the relationship between minority stressand same-sex partner violence perpetration (but ratherLGBTQ youth’s perceptions of same-sex partner violence),three studies directly have examined these relationships insamples of community adults (Balsam and Syzmanski2005; McKenry et al. 2006; Carvalho et al. 2011). Whereastwo studies found significant and positive relationshipsbetween facets of minority stress and perpetration of same-sex partner violence (Balsam and Syzmanski 2005;Carvalho et al. 2011), another study found no significantassociations between minority stress and perpetration ofsame-sex partner violence (McKenry et al. 2006). In lightof these conflicting findings and the dearth of informationon same-sex partner violence among younger populations,research with youth is needed to better understand therelationship between sexual minority stress and same-sexpartner violence. Moreover, based on research with heter-osexual youth (Archer 2000; Dardis et al. 2012; Straus2008) and LGBTQ adults (Bartholomew et al. 2008;Oringher and Samuelson 2011; Stanley et al. 2006)documenting that partner violence is often mutual andbidirectional (i.e., perpetrated by both partners rather thanone partner), research with LGBTQ college youth is nee-ded to understand better the relationships among concur-rent partner violence victimization and perpetrationexperiences.1722 J Youth Adolescence (2013) 42:1721–1731123Research Questions and HypothesesResearch suggests that partner violence is a problem amongLGBTQ college youth. Although there is no study to datewith college youth on the factors directly associated withperpetration of same-sex partner violence, a minority stressframework may be helpful in understanding this phenom-enon. Using a sample of US college students currently insame-sex relationships, the current study sought to answerthe following questions: What are the rates of perpetrationof same-sex partner violence (physical, psychological,sexual) against one’s current partner?; What are the rela-tionships among perpetration of same-sex partner violenceand externalized minority stressors (sexual-orientation-related victimization; perception of prejudice or discrimi-nation towards LGBTQ persons), internalized minoritystressors (internalized homonegativity, identity conceal-ment), and same-sex partner violence victimization (phys-ical, psychological, sexual)? Guided by existing researchand theory, we generally hypothesized that the perpetrationof same-sex partner violence would be associated positivelywith same-sex partner violence victimization and exter-nalized and internalized minority stress variables.MethodParticipantsAnalyses for the current study included 391 youth fromcolleges across the US currently involved in a same-sexromantic relationship recruited for an online study throughmultiple methods (see Procedure section for a description).Roughly half the sample identified as men (48.8 %),43.5 % as women, 4.6 % as genderqueer, 2.1 % as trans-man/woman, and 1 % as other. Further, 72.1 % identifiedas gay or lesbian, 15.3 % as queer, 5.6 % as bisexual,4.6 % pansexual, and 2.4 % other (e.g., questioning,straight). The average age of participants was 20.77(SD = 1.88), with ages ranging from 18 to 25. Themajority of participants identified as Caucasian (72.1 %),followed by Latino or Hispanic (8.7 %), multi-racial(7.9 %), African-American (5.6 %), Asian or PacificIslander (5.4 %), and American Indian or Alaska Native(0.3 %). Approximately 48, 28, and 24 % stated that theircombined family/parents’ annual income was less than$50,000, between $51,000 and $100,000, and greater than$100,000, respectively.The majority of participants attended public colleges/universities (67.0 %), with 25.8 % attending private, non-religiously affiliated colleges, 6.4 % attending religiouslyaffiliated colleges, and 0.8 % attending professional/tradeschools. About one-third of participants (32.7 %) attendedcolleges in the Northeast, followed by the Midwest(28.1 %), the West (22.7 %), and the Southeast (16.5 %).Most participants described their current relationship as amonogamous dating relationship (80.4 %); an additional17.5 % reported that they were partnered in an open rela-tionship, and 2.1 % were married or in a domestic partnership/civil union. On average, participants had been involved in theircurrent relationship for about a year (M = 12.73 months;SD = 13.58 months; Range: 0–96 months).ProcedureParticipants were recruited through several mediums: (a) arandom sample of 250 colleges and universities in the USwere selected and contact information was obtained forLGBTQ centers/organizations, diversity centers/organiza-tions, women’s centers/organizations or relevant upperadministration (e.g., student affairs administrator, dean ofstudents) if relevant center/organization staff could not bedetermined; (b) e-mails were sent to members of the Con-sortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals(an organization of providing contact information for 200 UScolleges/universities that employ a full time staff membercommitted to LGBTQ issues), (c) facebook advertisementstargeting college youth between the ages of 18–25 and cur-rently in a same-sex relationship, (d) postings on websitesfrequented by LGBTQ youth, and (e) snowball sampling byasking participants to share the web address with otherpotential participants. With regard to e-mail recruitment (aand b), researchers sent an e-mail to the identified contactperson requesting that an attached recruitment message besent out to any relevant LGBTQ listserv/student organizationmembers. The majority of participants indicated that theyhad heard about the study through a campus organizationlistserv/e-mail (52.2 %) or facebook advertisements(40.4 %), whereas 0.5 and 6.9 % of participants indicatedthat they had been recruited through website postings andsnowball sampling, respectively.To participate in the study, youth were required to be atleast 18 years of age and currently involved in a same-sexromantic relationship. If participants were currentlyinvolved in more than one relationship, they wereinstructed to answer the questions regarding the partner/relationship that was most significant to the participant.Informed consent was obtained prior to starting the ques-tionnaire, and participants completed the survey online.Following completion, respondents were debriefed and hadthe option of entering a raffle to win one of ten $100 giftcards. All research was conducted in compliance with theuniversity’s Institutional Review Board.To decrease the likelihood of a participant taking thesurvey more than once, participants were instructed thatparticipating more than once would not increase theirJ Youth Adolescence (2013) 42:1721–1731 1723123likelihood of receiving one of the gifts cards. Additionally,a single item was included in the survey asking participantsif they had already taken the survey. Participants (n = 3)responding ‘‘yes’’ to this question were excluded fromanalyses.MeasuresCurrent Partner AbuseThe Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2; Straus et al.1996) was utilized to assess for the presence of physical(12 items; e.g., ‘‘pushed or shoved me’’), sexual (fiveitems; e.g., ‘‘made me have sex without a condom’’), andpsychological (four items; e.g., ‘‘called me fat or ugly’’)victimization and perpetration in participants’ currentrelationships. Participants indicated the number of timesthey have experienced and performed each behavior from 0(Never) to 6 (More than 20 times). The CTS2 includesitems assessing moderate and severe partner abuse (Strauset al. 1996); these items were combined for rates ofphysical and sexual abuse. However, for psychologicalabuse, only severe items were included in estimates, giventhat moderate items (e.g., shouted or yelled) may reflectmore normative conflict resolution within dating relation-ships, rather than psychological abuse (Edwards et al.2011; Shorey et al. 2011). Each participant was then codedas either 0 (no victimization/perpetration in current rela-tionship) or 1 (any victimization/perpetration in currentrelationship) on each of the following six variables: phys-ical victimization, sexual victimization, psychologicalvictimization, physical perpetration, sexual perpetration,and psychological perpetration.Minority StressSeveral scales and questions were employed to ascertainthe degree of minority stress experienced by participants.Internalized Homonegativity The internalized homoneg-ativity subscale was taken from Mohr and Fassinger’s(2000) Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale. The five-item internalized homonegativity subscale measures thedegree to which an individual feels negatively about his/herLGBTQ identity (e.g., ‘‘Homosexual lifestyles are not asfulfilling as heterosexual lifestyles,’’ ‘‘I would rather bestraight if I could’’). Responses range from 1 (DisagreeStrongly) to 7 (Agree Strongly), with higher scores indi-cating higher levels of internalized homonegativity. Cron-bach’s alpha for the current sample was .81.Sexual Identity Concealment Sexual identity conceal-ment was measured using Mohr and Fassinger’s (2000)Outness Inventory. This 11-item scale assesses the degreeto which the participants’ family, friends, coworkers, andmembers of their religious community are aware of theirsexual orientation. Participants are presented with differentpersons (e.g., mother, work supervisors) and respond on aseven-point Likert scale ranging from (this) person defi-nitely does not know about your sexual orientation status to(this) person definitely knows about your sexual orientationstatus, and it is openly talked about. Participants are alsogiven the option of providing a ‘‘not applicable’’ responseto individual items (e.g., individuals that do not belong to areligious community would not respond to items regardingtheir level of outness to religious community members).Based on scoring recommendations (Mohr and Fassinger2000), all items that were answered (excluding ‘‘notapplicable’’ responses which were excluded from theoverall score) were summed and divided by the number ofanswered items. Because the scale measures the degree towhich individuals are open about their sexual identity, allitems were reverse scored so that higher scores wouldindicate greater levels of sexual identity concealment.Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was good (.89).Stigma Participants’ perception of stigma based on sexualidentity was assessed by the Stigma Scale (Martin andDean 1987). The 11-item questionnaire measures the par-ticipant’s perception of external prejudice or discriminationtowards LGBTQ persons (e.g., ‘‘Most people think less of aperson who is LGBT’’). Participants indicate their level ofagreement on a six-point Likert scale with higher scoresindicating greater perceptions of stigma. Cronbach’s alphafor this scale was .88.Sexual Orientation-Related Victimization The research-ers included an additional two items to assess a history ofvictimization based on the participant’s sexual orientation(i.e., ‘‘Have you ever been [physically attacked/verballyharassed] because of your sexual orientation?’’). Partici-pants indicated their agreement by selecting yes or no.A composite of these two items was created and partici-pants were then coded as either 0 (no sexual orientation-related victimization) or 1 (any sexual orientation-relatedvictimization).ResultsData PreparationRates of missing values for questions assessing types ofpartner violence perpetration and victimization, which weretowards the end of the online survey, ranged from 3.8 to9.5 %. Rates of missing values for sexual orientation-related1724 J Youth Adolescence (2013) 42:1721–1731123victimization and minority stress variables, which weretowards the beginning and middle of the online survey,were less than 1 %. A total of 39 cases (10 % of thesample) had at least one minority stress or partner vio-lence variable missing. SPSS Missing Values was used toexplore and handle missing data. Missing values weredetermined to be missing completely at random (Little1988). We employed multiple imputation techniques tohandle missing data on variables assessing partner vio-lence and minority stress factors (Acock 2005; Tabachnickand Fidel 2007). Descriptive statistics presented in thepaper were calculated using the original data (prior toimputation), and all inferential data reflects pooled sta-tistics using the imputed data.Descriptive StatisticsRates of partner violence and sexuality-related victimiza-tion are presented in Table 1. Means and standard devia-tions for continuous variables used in the current study arepresented in Table 2.Aim 1What are the rates of partner violence perpetration incurrent same-sex relationships?In current same-sex relationships among LGBTQ col-lege youth, physical partner violence was the most com-monly reported type of perpetration (19.9 %), followed bypsychological (12.5 %) and sexual perpetration of partnerviolence (10.5 %). Nearly one-third (29.7 %) of the samplereported engaging in any type of partner violenceperpetration. Moreover, 57.1 % of the sample reported nosame-sex partner violence victimization or perpetration,13.3 % of the sample reported same-sex partner violencevictimization only, 7.3 % reported perpetration of same-sex partner violence only, and 22.3 % reported both same-sex partner violence victimization and perpetration.Aim 2What are the relationships among perpetration of same-sexpartner violence variables and minority stress and same-sexpartner violence victimization variables?Table 3 presents correlations among all study variables.Given that the primary variables (i.e., same-sex partnerviolence) of interest were nonlinear, we computed Spear-men’s rho correlations (Tabachnick and Fidell 2007).Results demonstrated that all forms of perpetration ofpartner violence (sexual, physical, and psychological) wererelated to one another. Moreover, all forms of same-sexpartner violence victimization (sexual, physical, and psy-chological) were related to all forms of same-sex partnerviolence perpetration.Next, three hierarchical logistic regression analyses wereconducted in order to determine how sexual minority stressvariables related to same-sex partner violence perpetrationvariables after controlling for same-sex partner violencevictimization variables. Thus, the same-sex partner violencevictimization variables were entered in block one and thesexual minority stress variables were entered in block two.Only variables that demonstrated significant bivariate asso-ciations with the criterion variable of interest were enteredinto the regression analyses. Although both blocks of theregression analyses are presented in Table 4, herein we onlydiscuss the results of the second and final block of the models.With regard to minority stress variables, internalizedhomonegativity was related significantly and positively tophysical and sexual same-sex partner violence perpetration,but unrelated to psychological partner violence perpetra-tion. Sexual identity concealment was related significantlyand positively to physical perpetration of same-sex partnerviolence, and unrelated to psychological and sexual per-petration of same-sex partner violence. Sexual-orientation-related victimization was related significantly and posi-tively to psychological perpetration of same-sex partnerviolence, and unrelated to physical and sexual perpetrationof same-sex partner violence. Perceptions of external sex-ual orientation stigma were unrelated to same-sex partnerviolence perpetration.The model for physical perpetration of same-sex partnerviolence was significant, v2 (df = 5) = 156.67, p \\ .001,Nagelkerke R2 = .507.

Althoughfew studies have assessed the perpetration of same-sexpartner violence, the rates found in the current study arelower than rate of the perpetration of same-sex partnerviolence found in Jones and Raghavan’s (2012) study ofcollege youth and in samples of community adults report-ing on prior year perpetration (Bartholomew et al. 2008;Craft and Serovich 2005; McKenry et al. 2006), but higherthan those found in a community sample of adults reportingon lifetime same-sex partner violence based on their owndefinition of ‘‘domestic violence’’ (Carvalho et al. 2011).These discrepancies likely are based on methodologicaldifferences; in our study, we used behavioral measures ofpartner violence perpetration at any point in participants’current relationships. Although participants in our studyreported being in their current relationships on average forone year, there was a great deal of variability in relation-ship length (SD = 13.58 months).Although not a major aim of the current study, it isimportant to note that, on average, participants disagreedwith items assessing internalized homonegativity, which isreassuring. However, participants, on average, reportedmoderate agreement on items assessing sexual orientationidentity concealment and perceived sexual orientationstigma. Both of these findings are consistent with priorresearch (Cox et al. 2011; Mohr and Daly 2008). Moreover,it is alarming that 73 % of the sample reported being thevictim of physical assault or verbal harassment that wasmotivated by their sexual orientation. The rates found bythe current study closely resemble D’Augelli’s (1992) highrate (77 % verbal harassment; 8 % or more physical-assault-based harassment) of sexual orientation relatedvictimization among LGBTQ college students. Overall,these findings demonstrate that, despite the high rates ofexternalized minority stressors, namely sexual orientationrelated victimization, faced by college youth, manyLGBTQ college youth display resilience and do not inter-nalize these negative experiences, as evidenced by thegenerally low levels of internalized markers of minoritystresses (i.e., internalized homonegativity and sexualidentity concealment).In addition to assessing the rates of same-sex partnerviolence and minority stress variables among collegeyouth, the current study explored the relationships amongthese variables. Although both same-sex partner violencevictimization and minority stress variables generally wererelated to same-sex partner violence perpetration vari-ables, differential patterns emerged among these rela-tionships. Indeed, in the multivariate regression analyses,after controlling for concurrent same-sex partner violencevictimization, internalized homonegativity demonstrated apositive association with physical and sexual perpetrationof same-sex partner violence, and identity concealmentdemonstrated a positive association with physical perpe-tration of same-sex partner violence; none of the minoritystress variables were associated significantly with psy-chological perpetration of same-sex partner violence in thepresence of victimization variables. These findings aresimilar to those obtained by Balsam and Syzmanski(2005) who reported a positive relationship between life-time perpetration of same-sex partner violence and inter-nalized homonegativity among lesbian communitywomen. However, unlike previous studies (i.e., Balsamand Syzmanski 2005; Carvalho et al. 2011) that foundidentity concealment unrelated to the perpetration ofsame-sex partner violence among community adults(which could have been due to restricted range issues),identity concealment was related to the perpetrationphysical partner violence in our sample of college youth.Finally, although Carvalho et al. (2011) found that stigmawas associated positively with perpetration of same-sexpartner violence, something that was not replicated in ourmultivariate analyses, Carvalho et al. (2011) did notinclude concurrent victimization as a covariate in theirmultivariate analyses.It is important to consider concurrent partner violencevictimization when examining the relationships amongminority stress and partner violence perpetration giventhat partner violence victimization is the most consistentand robust predictor of partner violence perpetration (seeDardis et al. 2012, for a review), and partner violence isoften mutual and bidirectional (Archer 2000; Bartholo-mew et al. 2008; Oringher and Samuelson 2011; Stanleyet al. 2006). Thus, by including partner violence victim-ization in the regression models, we were able to elucidatethe additive effects that minority stress variables have onthe perpetration of partner violence. Moreover, previousresearch has found that minority stress variables arerelated to partner violence victimization (Balsam andSyzmanski 2005; Carvalho et al. 2011), and consistentwith the finding in the current study that internalizedhomonegativity was correlated positively with psycho-logical partner violence victimization. Thus, a strength ofthe present study was the inclusion of both partner vio-lence victimization and perpetration, which allows for amore complete understanding of partner violence amongLGBTQ college youth.Taken together, these findings suggest that minoritystress and concurrent same-sex partner violence victim-ization are important in understanding the perpetration ofsame-sex partner violence among college youth. Moreover,internalized homonegativity seems to be more influential inthe perpetration of same-sex partner violence than anyother minority stress variable. It is possible that external-ized minority stressors, such as discrimination and sexual-orientation-related victimization, are not the driving factorsJ Youth Adolescence (2013) 42:1721–1731 1727123in the perpetration of same-sex partner violence, but ratherit is the extent to which LGBTQ college youth internalizethese experiences that are most influential in the perpe-tration of same-sex partner violence. Although identityconcealment (a hypothesized internalized minority stressvariable) was not as consistently or strongly related to theperpetration of same-sex partner violence as internalizedhomonegativity, this may be due to the fact that not allidentity concealment is done out of shame. In fact, forsome LGBTQ individuals, it may be adaptive to concealone’s identity to avoid discrimination and sexual-orienta-tion-related victimization (Balsam and Syzmanski 2005;Corrigan and Matthews 2003). Thus, whereas internalizedhomonegativity clearly reflects feelings of negativitytoward one’s sexual orientation, this may not always be thecase for identity concealment, and could explain why thisvariable was related less consistently and strongly to theperpetration of same-sex partner violence in the currentstudy.Future research is needed to understand better the fac-tors that may mediate or moderate the relationship betweeninternalized minority stressors and the perpetration ofsame-sex partner violence among LGBTQ college youth.Lewis et al. (2012) suggested that LGBTQ individuals mayattempt to cope with minority stress through substance use,which subsequently increases the risk for perpetration ofsame-sex partner violence. Given that research demon-strates positive associations between sexual minority stressand substance use among LGBTQ youth (Woodford et al.2012), alcohol is an especially important mediating factorto consider in future research on minority stress and same-sex partner violence. In addition to alcohol use, there arelikely other mediating factors (e.g., relationship quality thatfully mediated the relationship between internalizedhomonegativity and partner violence in Balsam and Syz-manski 2005 study with lesbian community women),which are important avenues for future work. Moreover,research is needed to understand the factors that maymoderate the relationships between sexual minority stressand the perpetration of same-sex partner violence. In otherwords, what factors could serve as buffers to preventagainst sexual minority stress and same-sex partner vio-lence? Research demonstrates that social support serves asa buffer against the impact of minority stress on mental andphysical health outcomes among LGBTQ adults (Lewiset al. 2012). Although never examined in samples ofLGBTQ college youth, it is presumable that strong socialsupport networks may serve as a protective factor againstsexual minority stress and the perpetration of same-sexpartner violence.A better understanding of the mechanisms by whichminority stress leads to the perpetration of partner violenceas well as protective factors against sexual minority stressand same-sex partner violence could have importantimplications for continued theory development and inter-ventions. Disempowerment and minority stress theoriessuggest that a number of factors (i.e., identity concealmentand confusion; experienced and anticipated rejection, vic-timization and discrimination; and internalized homoneg-ativity/sexual self-stigma) are related to the perpetration ofsame-sex partner violence. However, the findings of thecurrent study suggest that internalized homonegativity maybe the most salient minority stress correlate of the perpe-tration of same-sex partner violence. Future theoreticalwork could benefit from integrating an assessment of theetiology and development of internalized homonegativitywith factors that may serve as mediators (e.g., alcohol,depression) and moderators (e.g., social support) in therelationship between internalized homonegativity and theperpetration of partner violence. In addition to theoreticalimplications, the findings from the current study haveimplications for partner abuse prevention programming.LGBTQ youth are frequently ‘‘invisible in mainstreamyouth programs’’ (Horn et al. 2009, p. 864), and youthpartner abuse prevention programs are no exception to this.Although some components (e.g., assertiveness communi-cation skills training) of existing partner violence preven-tion programming developed for heterosexual youth isrelevant to LGBTQ youth, the findings of the current studysuggest that partner violence prevention programming forLGBTQ college youth should integrate techniques (devel-oping positive self-regard, increasing social support net-works, exposure to positive LGBTQ messages and rolemodels; Goodenow et al. 2006; Russell et al. 2009;Szalacha 2003; Walls et al. 2010; for a review, see alsoHansen 2007) to reduce internalized homonegativity,which could subsequently lead to reductions in partnerviolence and other negative psychological and behavioralsequelae.Whereas the current study aids in our understanding ofsame-sex partner violence perpetration and its associationswith minority stress and concurrent same-sex partner vio-lence victimization, there are several limitations to thecurrent study. First, as previously discussed, we did notinclude measures to explain the relationship betweenminority stress and same-sex partner violence. Second, thevast majority of our sample was obtained through methodsthat required individuals to openly identify as LGBTQ, andalthough we attempted to recruit participants through othermeans (e.g., posting on self-help websites for questioningyouth), those methods resulted in very few participants(n = 2). Third, our sample was limited to young adultsattending college and cannot be generalized to youngadults who do not attend college. Fourth, although it ispromising that we found generally low to moderate levelsof minority stress variables (e.g., identity concealment and1728 J Youth Adolescence (2013) 42:1721–1731123internalized homonegativity), the restricted range on someof these variables could have limited our ability to detectsignificant relationships among minority stress variablesand partner violence variables. Fifth, participants wererequired to be currently in relationships to participate in ourstudy, and it is possible that individuals in very abusiverelationships did not participate, which could have resultedin a selection bias. Sixth, although the CTS2 (Straus et al.1996) is the most widely used measure of partner violence,it is widely criticized for providing a decontextualizedunderstanding of partner violence that does not take intoaccount the motives for the violence (e.g., power andcontrol, self-defense), who initiates the violence, or thephysical and psychological outcomes associated with theviolence (Kimmel 2002). Seventh, we utilized a cross-sectional design that does not allow for an understanding ofthe temporal relationships among the perpetration of same-sex partner violence, same-sex partner violence victim-ization, and minority stress. Finally, despite recommenda-tions to conduct gender-specific analyses when exploringthe correlates of partner violence perpetration (Dardis et al.2012), we did not do this given the gender fluidity in ourstudy (i.e., men, women, genderqueer, transman, trans-woman, and ‘‘other’’) and our concerns regarding cell sizesfor some of the partner violence variables [e.g., 10.5 %(n = 41) of the entire, mixed-gender sample reportedperpetrating sexual partner violence, which would becomeeven smaller if we divided this by gender]. Moreover,power dynamics within a relationship extend beyond gen-der and include power related to other social identities suchas racial and ethnic identity and socioeconomic status(Brown 2008). Although the consideration of these othersocial identities was beyond the scope of the current study,future research with LGBTQ youth could benefit fromunderstanding how other marginalized identities intersectwith sexual orientation to influence the perpetration ofpartner violence using a minority status framework.Moreover, future research should endeavor to utilize lon-gitudinal designs, employ larger and more diverse samplesof LGBTQ youth, explore alternative methods of datacollection, and include measures to better capture thecontext of same-sex partner violence and the factors thatare hypothesized to mediate and moderate the relationshipbetween minority stress and the perpetration of same-sexpartner violence.In conclusion, although previous research with LGBTQyouth has documented the deleterious psychologicalsequelae of sexual minority stress (Almeida et al. 2009;Cox et al. 2011; Kelleher 2009; Mohr and Daly 2008;Vanden Berghe et al. 2010), the current study extends thisprevious work by examining the minority stress correlatesof the perpetration of partner violence among a sample ofLGBTQ college youth. The findings from the current studyadd to the growing body of literature demonstrating thatpartner violence is a concern in LGBTQ youth relation-ships. Moreover, the results of this study underscore theutility of understanding partner violence among LGBTQyouth through a minority stress framework, and the par-ticularly salient role of internalized homonegativity on theperpetration of partner violence even in the presence ofconcurrent partner violence victimization. A better under-standing of sexual minority stress and its relationship tosame-sex partner violence, as well as the explanatorymechanisms of these relationships, will be useful in tai-loring prevention and intervention efforts for LGBTQyouth. However, programming efforts alone will not leadto widespread reductions in same-sex partner violencebecause these experiences are situated within larger het-erosexist and violence-tolerant social and institutionalcontexts and these too must be addressed.Acknowledgments We would like to thank all of the individualswho participated in this study.
