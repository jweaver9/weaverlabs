The former president’s words evoke the democratic spirit ofthe United States and its status as a home to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all.Clinton’s uplifting statement of inclusivity starkly contrasts the subject matter he writes about,however. The quote above is taken from his statement on the signing of H.R. 3396 into law,otherwise known as the Defense of Marriage Act.Since the 1950s, the level of oppression faced by the American LGBTQ+ community hasconsisted of affronts to personal freedoms and rights, attacks not just limited to theaforementioned Defense of Marriage Act. Fighting for basic American liberties and againstdiscrimination on a daily basis makes being queer in the United States mentally exhausting andsignificantly distressing. Dissonance in both political and social contexts is especiallychallenging. While a lawmaker may speak for equality, they may go ahead in signingdiscriminatory policy. While a family member or friend may support one’s identity, they maymake a comment that outs their bigoted beliefs.The connections between LGBTQ+ mental health and policy have been minimallyexplored, despite the large issue they presents. Noting the correlations between the poor mentalhealth of a minoritized population and the policy imposed on them is essential to understandingthe daily stressors certain laws and orders present. As Dr. Anthony Fauci, Holy Cross ‘62, said inhis talk with this semester’s DC cohort, understanding policy is essential to understanding how itaffects people. The following thesis seeks to answer the question of how policy debatessurrounding the rights of queer Americans affect their mental health. It also seeks to use theoriesIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 3of minority stress and stigma to address how these pressures appear in social and politicalcontexts. It will draw connections between society, policy, and psychological wellbeing, lookingbeyond the individual and to environmental stressors as explanations for decades of mentalhealth disparity. It will explore two particularly impactful moments in LGBTQ+ policy – theDefense of Marriage Act and Obergefell v. Hodges – in order to support the position that policyaffirming the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans improves their mental health, while policy thatattacks those rights harms it. Special thanks to my fall semester internship site, the HumanRights Campaign, for providing the inspiration for the topic this thesis focuses on. Throughout it,resources from the nonprofit will be featured, honoring its significance to LGBTQ+ advocacy inthe United States and the journey to marriage equality.BackgroundHistory of Anti-LGBTQ+ Legislation in the United StatesThere is an extensive history of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in the United States, and areview of said legislation is essential to understanding the compounding ramifications it has hadon the queer community as a whole. The following section will summarize major anti-LGBTQ+policy moments in American history, events that markedly sought to oppress gay and lesbianAmericans via executive orders, bills, Supreme Court cases, or passed legislation between theyears 1950-1996. Prior to the 21st century very few LGBTQ+ affirming policies existed and it istherefore not as crucial to cover them in this section. The following paragraphs will address areaswhere government inaction seriously harmed the LGBTQ+ community in the United States.The first significant anti-LGBTQ+ legislation began in the 1950s, with the LavenderScare and Eisenhower’s Executive Order 10450. The order sought to actively remove queerpeople from the United States government, due to the fear that they were vulnerable targets forIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 4blackmail and national security threats (Haynes, 2020). “Queer” as a term was more of a slur inthis era of politics – when LGBTQ+ people were targeted, the term was used as a derogatory,punitive adjective to refer to the “abnormal” disposition the group held in society. Much likeMcCarthyism, the Lavender Scare investigated government employees and their private lives.Up to 10,000 people lost their jobs, as a result of being fired or resigning out of fear ofinvestigation (Haynes, 2020). Eisenhower’s executive order was one of the first examples offearmongering and scapegoating surrounding the idea of queer people in society. It removedqueer people from the policy conversation, leaving them with no way to advocate for themselveswithin the American government proper.Sodomy laws constituted the main source of societal oppression against LGBTQ+identifying Americans for most of the 20th century. Inherited from colonial laws, they sought tosurveil nonprocreative sexual activity and were used primarily to limit same-sex consensual sex(Eskridge, 2009). Where Eisenhower’s executive order surveilled government employees,sodomy laws surveilled everyday citizens. Illinois was the first state to rescind this legislation in1962 following the Model Penal Code’s recommendations for standardized criminalpunishments, and thereafter the decision to follow suit was left up to the states (Canaday, 2008).The 1986 Supreme Court case Bowers v. Hardwick upheld that the practice was constitutional,and after that, sodomy was not federally addressed until 4 decades later in Lawrence v. Texas(Human Rights Campaign, n.d.). These laws policed queer people from living their lives openly,under the guise of upholding social morals. No queer people could actively change these laws,because they did not hold positions of power in government – whether that be federal or statelevel legislatures.IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 5Between the 1960s and 1980s, major progress was made throughout the gay rightsmovement and sexual revolution – all of this progress was lost as an entire generation ofLGBTQ+ Americans passed away from AIDS and a lack of presidential action. As the issuereached the forefront of national attention, Ronald Reagan created the Watkins Commission viaExecutive Order 12601, in order to handle the public health crisis the HIV/AIDS epidemicpresented. He was provided with over 500 recommendations, including advice to extendanti-discrimination protections to those with HIV (Reagan, 1987; Presidential Commission,1988). The Fourth Great Awakening of the 80s, or resurgence of religion in the evangelisttradition, led to increased oppression toward the LGBTQ+ community from the Republican partyand the Christian right. This resurgence of religion in politics cast an ugly shadow over anypotential for equality legislation. While publicly opposing discrimination on the basis of an HIVdiagnosis, Ronald Reagan failed to implement policy that would have saved the lives ofhundreds of thousands of queer Americans. He instead chose to uphold his Christian values infavor of appealing to those that voted for him in 1984 (Yehia & Frank, 2011). The loss of anentire generation of queer activists erased the progress made in the 60s and 70s during the gayliberation movement, all due to Reagan’s inaction as president and failure to help a communityout of a major public health crisis. The AIDS crisis continued beyond Reagan’s presidency, asdid the mass hysteria imposed on the queer community.The LGBTQ+ community fought an uphill battle heading into the 90s, and was knockeddown by Clinton’s two major anti-queer policies just as public perception of queer people wasshifting. By 1990, the queer community had lost hundreds of thousands of gay men to theHIV/AIDS crisis and Ronald Reagan’s failure to act, sodomy was still a crime in 28 states, publicperception instilled fear in heterosexual Americans toward the gay community, and almost noIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 6queer people served in federal positions. The 1994 Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell directive, (also knownas DODD 1304.26) allowed gay Americans to serve in the military, but only if they did notdisclose their sexuality (Department of Defense, 1994). Originally instituted as a way to preventharassment on the basis of sexual orientation, the language it used prevented individuals who“demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts” from serving because it wouldresult in “unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order, and discipline” in theUnited States Military (Department of Defense, 1994). Rather than protecting the morale orintegrity of the armed forces, this directly discriminated against out queer people and forcedLGBTQ+ military personnel to deny an aspect of their identity while fighting for a country thatactively campaigned against their own rights.As this brief history shows, the personal has become increasingly political. Facets ofidentity have become weaponized attacks on minorities in the United States, and methods ofgaining votes for candidates on both the left and right. The personal and political are bothinherently psychological. Instances like those mentioned are bound to have deep psychologicalimplications for the groups they target, and for the political landscape and social consciousnessthey shape. These attitudes were brought forward into the late 20th century and early 21stcentury and the respective case studies that will be addressed in this thesis.History of Mental Health Disparities in the LGBTQ+ CommunityThe history of queer mental health is just as troubling as the history of anti-LGBTQ+legislation. Being queer is a known social determinant of health (Adler, Glymour, & Fielding,2016). Before linking the two in this thesis’ case studies, an understanding of how mental healthstruggles have manifested in the LGBTQ+ community is also essential.IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 7Queerness holds an inherent link to the study of mental illness and psychology, as it wasoriginally regarded as a mental disorder in the first few editions of the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual of Mental Disorders. Up until 1973, the DSM cited homosexuality as an indication ofsexual deviance, “a sociopathic personality disturbance”, and it was included in the personalitydisorder section of the manual (American Psychological Association, 1952). The DSM-IIremoved homosexuality as a formal diagnosis, which also coincided with the sexual revolutionand a shift in public opinion toward LGBTQ+ people. However, mental conditions as a result ofdistress from homosexuality remained in the DSM until 2013 with the DSM-5.The framing of homosexuality as a mental disorder for around two decades led to thecreation of conversion therapy, popularized as a way to “heal” those who did not comply withsocially acceptable notions of sexuality. Because homosexuality was socially othered for so long,it was deemed as something to be fixed or “cured”. Initially intended as a way to help, researchhas shown that conversion therapy has done significantly more harm than good. It is associatedwith higher rates of depression, suicidality, and fewer overall positive outcomes in life (Ryan,Toomey, Diaz, & Russell, 2020). The harm done by the psychology field unto the LGBTQ+community has been responsible for a rift between queer people and therapy – although queerpeople present a high need for psychotherapy, they are generally less trusting of it due to pastindications of its harm (Ryan et al., 2020). Many LGBTQ+ people have had poor experienceswith mental health care, thus choosing not to seek it out any longerHistorically, LGBTQ+ people have generally been at a higher risk for mental illness dueto a variety of stressors attributed to their identities. Over half of LGBTQ+ Americans reportexperiencing some form of mental health struggle, diagnosed or not, and are twice as likelycompared to heterosexual Americans (Human Rights Campaign; Medley, 2016). PotentialIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 8stressors include lingering social prejudice and stigma, which sociologists and psychologistscorrelate with increased mental stress (Goffman, 1963). The aftermath of coming out to friendsand family can contribute to increased social strain and family tension – 40% of LGBTQ+people have experienced some form of rejection from a family member after doing so (PewResearch Center, 2013). Coming out can sometimes be a protective factor but since many queerpeople come out at younger ages, negative reactions can impact social and emotional growth andset up a diathesis for a later stressor (Russel & Fish, 2016). Workplace or communitydiscrimination has similar impacts, as it also reflects stigma and prejudice. Harassment and hatecrimes can be both passive and violent forms of aggression toward LGBTQ+ people, with them,with FBI research on crime indicating that queer people are more at risk for hate crimes than anyother minority group (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2018). Experiencing a hate crime elevatesrisk for a trauma disorder, either short term or post-traumatic stress disorder that can take yearsto overcome. LGB adults are twice as likely to abuse drugs, for a variety of reasons, but mostsignificantly as a coping mechanism (Roberts, Rosario, Corliss, Koenen, & Austin, 2012). Thesestressors have decreased in prevalence, but have not entirely disappeared from society – meaningthat queer people must constantly be vigilant.Compounding stressors, associated with the intersecting identities of queer Americans,also exacerbate mental health. Queer people of color (QTPOC) experience symptoms ofdepression and anxiety at higher rates, but are diagnosed less often (Human Rights Campaign,n.d.). LGBTQ+ women tend to be at a higher risk for substance use (Hughes, McCabe, Wilsnack,West, & Boyd, 2010). LGBTQ+ Americans are at an incredibly high risk for suicide, more thanother minoritized groups, but some individual groups also experience increases or decreases tothis statistic (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.). Bisexual women, younger queer people, and whiteIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 9queer women tend to be the most at risk with queer men and black queer women experiencingsome protective factors based on their other identities as recent studies indicate (Ramchand,Schuler, Schoenbaum, Colpe, & Ayer, 2022). In terms of a connection to policy, this means thatpolicy affecting an individual in two categories of their identity will feel an amplified impact.Understanding both the history of anti-LGBTQ+ policy and LGBTQ+ mental healthdisparity and analyzing these two risk factors together is essential to understanding how policyplays into the parallel concerns these issues pose. Policy dictates the environment that LGBTQ+people live in, as does the social bias that presents so many risk factors for queer Americans.MethodIn order to analyze the connections between marriage equality policy and mental health, avariety of methodologies were used. Relevant background information has already beenconsidered in the preceding sections via a literature review on anti-LGBTQ+ policy initiativesand the state of LGBTQ+ mental health. The remainder of this paper consists of a scopingreview of the existing literature on these topics organized in findings, discussion, andconclusions sections. Findings on the mental health outcomes associated with the Defense ofMarriage Act and the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling were retrieved from psychology and sociologyjournals, using PsycInfo, PubMed, and JSTOR. They were then synthesized in order to find themost prominent outcomes and concerns for the LGBTQ+ community. Qualitative data was alsoconsulted in conjunction with more quantitative journals. Some excerpts from these wereincluded in order to ground this thesis in both psychological findings and lived experience. Theresulting analyses are compared in order to find the key differences between the two initiativesand their impacts.IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 10The studies consulted use different terminology to describe the LGBTQIA+ community.Thus far, this thesis has used the shorter acronym, LGBTQ+, in order to refer to the gay, lesbian,bisexual,, and queer community. It has also used “queer”, a reclaimed but contested term usedmore so by younger generations to refer to their same-gender loving identity. For clarity and easeof reading, this thesis will continue to use both interchangeably, or the shortened “LGBT” torefer to this same group of people regardless of the acronyms and terms used in sources. As anote, no research on marriage inequality has been conducted with a specific attention to theexperiences of transgender or gender nonconforming persons, and therefore, LGBTQ+ will notrefer to gender identity, but rather the sexual orienation statuses within the community, in thispaper.TheoriesA number of theories will also be incorporated in order to analyze all findings, includingstigma and minority stress theories. Erving Goffman originally coined the idea of social stigma.The Canadian sociologist defined stigma as the “situation of the individual who is disqualifiedfrom full social acceptance”, and thereby rejected from society on the basis of a discreditedattribute or trait (Goffman, 1963). Much of Goffman’s theory referred to the queer community,and the terminology he uses to refer to the three groups involved in stigma are derived fromqueer culture. He first refers to the “stigmatized”, those who are othered with the stigma. Next,he states there are “normals” who do not hold a stigmatized identity, and the “wise” who areaccepted by the “stigmatized” as allies, people who understand the othered and seek toempathize with them. Stigmatized, minoritized, othered individuals, according to Goffman, areostracized, devalued, discriminated against, and face psychological distress as a result of theirsocial shunning by normals (Goffman, 1963). Stigma theory has been expanded on sinceIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 11Goffman’s definition, but for the constraints of this thesis, stigma will refer to these three groupsand the repercussions the marginalization of one exacts.Stigma theory describes what is often referred to societally as prejudice. If one group iscollectively discriminated against and devalued by high ranking members of society, all ofsociety will gradually turn against the marginalized group. This can also be explained throughthe lens of policy that this thesis will employ. If policy, created by high ranking members ofCongress, the President, and the Supreme Court, collectively indicates that a certain social groupis not worthy of a certain freedom or right, that will reflect in the way society as a whole respectsa group. Prejudice is reflected in the laws intended to discriminate against othered groups just asmuch as it is in daily life and interactions.Operating off of the definitions of stigma, stigma theory, and social prejudice, minoritystress is a product of stigma and subsequent social shunning. It was originally defined as stresscreated by these social biases, and the cause of hostile and stressful environments that act as thediathesis for mental disorders (Meyer, 2003). These biases have persisted across interventionattempts and reveal deep seated structural, interpersonal, and individual challenge intrinsic to thesexual minority experience in terms of stress and health (Chaudoir, Wang, and Pachankis, 2017).These environments are inherently unhealthy for minoritized, stigmatized populations, such asthe environments oppressive policy makes for queer Americans.FindingsThe Defense of Marriage ActBackground. The Defense of Marriage Act, as this paper seeks to focus on as its firstcase study, was written into law by President Bill Clinton on September 20th, 1996. The text ofthe statute reads:IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 12Defense of Marriage Act - Amends the Federal judicial code to provide that no State,territory, or possession of the United States or Indian tribe shall be required to give effectto any marriage between persons of the same sex under the laws of any other suchjurisdiction or to any right or claim arising from such relationship.Establishes a Federal definition of: (1) \"marriage\" as only a legal union between one manand one woman as husband and wife; and (2) \"spouse\" as only a person of the oppositesex who is a husband or wife. (United States Government Printing Office, 1996,paragraphs 2-3)The law was two fold – first, it delegated the ability to decide if same-sex marriage would berecognized to each individual state (therefore opening the door to bans), and second, legally andfederally defined marriage as between a man and a woman and a spouse as someone of theopposite sex. After the issue of same-sex marriage first emerged in the 1980s amidst the AIDScrisis, it quickly gained traction as the political right began to fear its legalization. Most religiousgroups and other socially conservative groups in the United States were opposed, citing that bothtradition and the Bible offered no place for same-sex marriage (The Heritage Foundation, 2013).The bill was introduced in the House in May of 1996, where it passed by an overwhelmingmajority of 342 representatives (U.S. Congress, 1996). It moved on to the Senate in September,where 84 senators voted yes in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) (U.S. Congress,1996). This overwhelming majority speaks to LGBTQ+ sentiment at the time – while notexplicitly anti-gay, there was no push towards equitable policy and instead to “protect” marriageas a traditional institution and part of the status-quo. Simply put, DOMA created policy in aUnited States where queer rights were not deemed a social issue, marriage was.IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 13While the bill passed quickly in Congress, President Bill Clinton publicly opposedDOMA. Having just passed Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (DADT) two years prior, Clinton waschampioned as a pro-gay candidate during his campaign. DADT did repeal a 50 year ban onLGBTQ+ military service, but DOMA manages to suspend significantly more queer rights thanDADT did. Nevertheless, Clinton signed the bill while also calling it “unnecessary and divisive”(Clinton, 1996). His paradoxical stance was clearly driven by the political climate of an electionyear, not his actual thoughts on the matter. As evident in recent discussions of DOMA, in whichhe and Hillary Clinton both called it a defensive action on the behalf of Democrats,discrimination was not a part of his presidential agenda (Clinton, 2013; Lee, 2015). Thepresident’s stance on the issue does not eliminate the harm that the Defense of Marriage Actcaused to the queer community, but rather speaks to how pernicious that harm actually was.A federal definition for marriage allowed 35 states to avoid recognizing same-sexmarriage as legitimate and lawful almost immediately. These trigger bans also thereby deniedsame-sex couples over one thousand federal protections and privileges that opposite-sex coupleshad a right to, including rights to inheritance and joint tax returns (Pew Research Center, 2013).The newly imposed restrictions to marriage freedom posed an increase to social discrimination,but also economic disadvantage and a loss of basic legal protection for same-sex couples thatwas bound to wreak havoc.Impact on mental health. Policy as devaluing and damaging as the Defense of MarriageAct had a serious impact on LGBTQ+ mental health. While studies did not begin measuring theimpacts until a few years after its passing, DOMA brought immense psychological strain toqueer American lives, exacerbating the previous social strain they already felt. The Act’s passingis strongly correlated with increases to minority stress, psychological distress, higher levels ofIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 14internalized homophobia, lower self esteem, increases in alcohol disorders, and lower wellbeingoverall as a direct impact of statewide marriage bans. Queer Americans also suffer fromincreased psychological strain as a result of being denied the protective benefits of marriage.Minority stress greatly increased with DOMA’s passing, due to the oppressiveenvironment it upheld. Following the 2006 election, a series of studies were conducted in orderto measure the impacts of the policy on minority stress for LGBTQ+ people. The researcherspredicted such discriminatory policy would bring on an onslaught of negative messaging in theaftermath of marriage amendments being added to ballots around the country, and theirhypothesis was confirmed (Riggle, Rostosky, & Horne, 2009). A national survey of 1,552lesbian, gay, and bisexual Americans who lived in a state that passed a marriage amendment (onethat defined marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman) found that a significantnumber experienced an increase in minority stress as a direct result of the policy and itsmessaging (Rostosky, Riggle, Horne, & Miller, 2009). This included exposure to negative media,conversations in daily life, and amendment-related affect, and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric.Following the same election, an online content analysis performed by some of the sameresearchers found similar results. Queer Americans exposed to negative media expressed distresscharacterized by fear and anxiety (Rostosky, Riggle, Horne, Denton, & Huellemeier, 2010).These negative emotions, replicated results from the previous study, were again exacerbated bynegative rhetoric, religion, ignorance, conservative politics, and a lack of apparent organizing onthe behalf of LGBT activists. All of these stressors exacerbated preexisting minority stress (usedas a referenced concept in this study), leaving the community hopeless and resigned to theirpolitical and social environments (Rostosky et al., 2010). However, some of the sample felt aresolute and determined optimism in the face of discrimination– not uncharacteristic of theIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 15LGBTQ+ community. In 2022, a rainbow pride flag acts as more than just a welcome mat, but abeacon of hope for equality and a testament to resilience. Still, the two studies conducted bythese researchers support the position that rhetoric, actively anti-same-sex marriagecampaigning, and the environment that hate creates facilitates minority stress. Rostosky et. al’sstudies indicate that marriage inequality is positively correlated with an environment thatpromotes stress for those at a disadvantage for equal rights, because of the signals it sends tothose it oppresses.Smaller, more qualitative samples also replicated these findings of increases in minoritystress. Queer people from Tennessee exhibited an active fear of isolation, discrimination, andaggression for change in the face of their environment (Levitt, Ovrebo, Anderson-Cleveland,Leone, Jeong, Arm, Bonin, Cicala, Coleman, Laurie, Vardaman, & Horne, 2009). When askedquestions such as “What is the experience of being a GLBT person in the midst of legislativeinitiatives that seek to limit the rights of GLBT people?”, participants from the sample indicatedthat they were bombarded with “painful reminders that [they’re] seen as less human”, that theyare “not who [the government says] that they are, and that issues have a stronger impact if they“are actively important due to [their lives] regarding marriage…” (Levitt et al., 2009). Whilebeing disenfranchised, LGBTQ+ people who are legislated against face constant reminders oftheir othering and ostracization by the state or country they live in. They also become moreattentive to issues that directly affect them (marriage being one example), meaning the degree ofdistress faced is increased. Constantly surrounded by the reminder of their inequality, the stigmaand stress they face manifests in a tense and omnipresent focus on their devalued status. Overall,legislation against LGBTQ+ people and their right to marry results in a hostile environment thatacts as the stressor for negative psychological impact in this stigmatized population.IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 16The minority stress environment the Defense of Marriage Act created immensepsychological stress and took a toll on the queer community. As a result of the negativecampaigning and messaging associated with marriage amendments, a 2016 study found in asample of 62 same-sex couples that a significant number experienced negative affect anddecreased relationship satisfaction as a result (Frost & Fingerhut, 2016). A 2010 study found thatDSM psychiatric disorders increased significantly in areas where marriage bans were in place.Researchers examined a sample living in states with bans in 2004 and 2005 and found that mooddisorders and psychiatric comorbidities increased by roughly one third following the bansinstatement (Hatzenbuehler, McLaughlin, Keyes, & Hesin, 2010).. What is arguably moresignificant is the 248% increase in generalized anxiety disorder that followed these bans, anincrease also replicated in studies with a focus on minority stress (Rostosky, Riggle, Horne,Denton, & Huellemeier, 2010). Being disenfranchised and denied basic legal protections iscorrelated with a fear and anxiety that is almost inexplicable. An environment this hostile andoppressive is bound to create some fear and paranoia in a stigmatized population, especiallywhen media makes this discrimination so easily perceivable.The level of psychological distress faced by LGBTQ+ Americans is a result of perceiveddiscrimination, associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms, lower quality of life andsatisfaction, and loneliness. Being denied equality and handling the burden of beingdisenfranchised via policy also coincided with an uptick in internalized homophobia, which isoften correlated with feelings of shame, guilt, and low self esteem (Rowen & Malcolm, 2002;Tatum, 2016). Higher levels of negative affect, stress, and depressive symptoms are all indicatedin samples of queer people who are effectively told they are second class citizens (Rostosky etal., 2009). A few studies have correlated alcohol use disorders with marriage bans as well –IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 17already a large issue for the LGBTQ+ community at large, inequality makes drinking an evenmore prevalent coping mechanism (Hatzenbuehler 2010, Hughes et. al, 2010). Actively beingdenied a freedom such as marriage has a significant negative impact on mental health,specifically with minority stress and immense psychological distress.Another potential risk factor for mental health strain may also be the more broad andadverse impacts of marriage inequality. Marriage denial perpetuates an opportunity structure thatdisenfranchises queer people in the socio-cultural, legal, economic, and political aspects of theirlives. Socioeconomic inequality and racism are common risk factors for mental illness, and asalready mentioned in this paper, do disproportionately affect LGBTQ+ people outside ofmarriage (Adler, Boyce, Chesney, Folkman, Syme, 1993, Williams, 2018). Because of this,marriage access itself also ends up being a stressor – marriage as an institution supportswellbeing and acts as a protective factor for all people (Herdt & Kertzner, 2006). As Frost andFingerhut’s study posits, decreased relationship satisfaction is correlated with the Defense ofMarriage Act’s effects on state-wide marriage referendums. Without marriage available to offerthe protective factor it has, other risk factors (relationship dissatisfaction or other well knownpsychopathological trends) may become amplified, offering a diathesis and a stressor in the formof disenfranchisement on several stigmatized identities and negative LGBTQ+ sentimentrespectively. For example, perceived discrimination is “linked to a decreased sense of personalgrowth, diminished environmental mastery, and lowered self-acceptance in women in studies ofthe general population… [and] decreased quality of life and increased rates of psychologicaldistress and mood and anxiety disorders” (Herdt & Kertzner, 2006). Similar effects would likelybe evident in the LGBTQ+ population, or worse, considering other intersectional aspects ofminority stress.IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 18While quantitative data is compellingly indicative of the negative mental health effects ofthe Defense of Marriage Act and the marriage bans that resulted from it, qualitative data isequally as telling. It provides an important look at the everyday thoughts and feelings LGBTQ+people faced with devaluing statutes in place. Levitt et al.’s 2009 study included excerpts fromLGBTQ+ people in states with marriage bans that speak to the daily hardship they faced. Oneparticipant stated:“Defense of marriage . . . it’s like there’s an invading army and we have to defendmarriage . . . . Our society loves military metaphors . . . It certainly tells me that theyview the GLBT community as a threat” (Levitt et al., 2009, p. 74).The participant regards the Defense of Marriage Act as an attack, to further the militaristicdiction they employ. They feel targeted, as though their sexuality is on the offensive side of alosing battle for equality. They feel threatened, and as though their sexual minority statusvillainizes them and the LGBTQ+ community in the face of a social tradition like marriage. Thisspeaks to the daily feeling of dehumanization queer Americans faced under this policy. Anotherparticipant spoke to the ways in which more practical constructs make them feel othered:“It [discrimination] drops in places you wouldn’t expect it, like you’re filing your taxreturns and you can’t file jointly . . . I get really angry . . . because I’m honest with myselfabout who I am as a person, and I am a good person” (Levitt et al., 2009, p. 74).Being denied the right to file taxes with a partner, to claim benefits from them, or to receive anyof the same protections married heterosexual couples receive is discriminatory on a legal basis.Not having this right is frustrating to this participant, and goes so far as to bring on a moral crisis– not having access to these rights leads them to question their character, and what societybelieves about it. One more participant speaks to the paranoia policy like this brings on:IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 19“When you see the votes turn out and it’s 84%, 80%, 90%, you have to assume that youknow some of these people, that you know every day and interact with people who, insome regards, treat me as if I’m any other human being. But you wonder what’s going onin their head and their mind, and that can lead to some level of paranoia or fear or otherthings” ( (Levitt et al., 2009, p. 73).In order to enact policy like this, voting is required – whether it is for candidates, referendums, orsurveys of public opinion. This person sees the high statistics, and interprets that people theyknow quietly hold resentment for LGBTQ+ people. People throughout their life may hold thisnegative sentiment, one that would lead them to deny fundamental rights to a group of people. Itmakes them think about how bigoted people exist everywhere given this policy’s support, andtherefore, people they know may be homophobic and hateful. Living in a society where it is hardto trust someone due to a potential bias is fear inducing.Given these qualitative excerpts as well as the quantitative data, it is clear that DOMAcontributed to a tense environment of hate for queer Americans in the years it was in place,contributing to minority stress. Same-sex marriage bans also led to increases in anxiety anddepression symptoms, fear and paranoia, distrust, isolation, and increases in negative copingmechanisms such as drinking. The policy’s distal effects became proximal causes as theymatched public sentiment and social acceptance. Stigmatized identity created an inflammatoryenvironment for LGBTQ+ people under the Defense of Marriage Act.Obergefell v. HodgesBackground. On June 26th, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States officiallyoverturned the Defense of Marriage Act in a 5-4 vote, making all marriages in the United StatesIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 20legal and equal. After months of debate, appeals, and national conversation, the United Stateswas finally able to declare that love is love via the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, the secondcase study this thesis seeks to focus on. The case’s ruling sparked national celebration, viaparades, rallies in front of the Supreme Court, and an influx of LGBTQ+ pride and support onsocial media. Justice Kennedy closed out his majority opinion with the following:No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love,fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people becomesomething greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these casesdemonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It wouldmisunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Theirplea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment forthemselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one ofcivilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. TheConstitution grants them that right” (Cornell Law Library, 2015, paragraph 68).In this opinion, Kennedy (and coauthors Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan),acknowledge the undue harm that the Defense of Marriage Act presented, and the bans that camewith it. The majority recognizes the impacts of marriage denial, how heterosexual couples wouldnot want the same for themselves, and the long history of sociopolitical exclusion that LGBTQ+Americans have endured outside of a political context. In a conclusion that speaks to the mostcommon argument – that LGBTQ+ disrespect the religious definition of marriage – Kennedyclaims that the hopes of queer people to marry is not a disrespectful action, but one of profoundrespect for the institution. He speaks to the dignity granted in the Constitution, and his opinionIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 21expertly summarizes the arguments made for Obergefell – the importance of equality in a nationcreated on the basis of liberty.It was not an easy road to SCOTUS. The product of six individual court cases from fourstates, Obergefell v. Hodges was heard in the district and circuit courts of the United Statesbefore making it to Washington D.C. Between 2012 and 2014, district courts in Tennessee,Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio heard arguments Tanco v. Haslam, DeBoer v. Snyder, Bourke v.Beshear, Love v. Beshear, Obergefell v. Kasich, and Henry v. Wymyslo (Oyez, n.d.). The casesdealt with marriage inequality and more specifically the same-sex marriage bans allowed underthe Defense of Marriage Act (Cornell Law Library, 2015). All of them spoke to the inequality amarriage ban presented for LGBTQ+ Americans. Each was heard in its respective district court,which then declared same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional (Snow, 2014, Geidner, 2013,ACLU, 2015). Appeals were filed by the defendants in all of the cases, and the Sixth CircuitCourt of Appeals declared the same-sex marriage bans constitutional in 2014 (Denniston, 2014).Judge Jeffery Sutton of the Sixth Circuit Court stated that the plaintiffs’ claims did not make thecase for “constitutionalizing the definition of marriage” and that same-sex marriage rights shouldbe left up to the states as they were previously (Wolf, 2015). Due to the conflicting decisions, thesix cases became one in Obergefell v. Hodges, and were heard by the Supreme Court based onviolations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Rights clauses.Impact on mental health. The outpour of support for the LGBTQ+ community is justone positive benefit of the Obergefell decision – it drastically changed queer mental health forthe better and is correlated significant increased social acceptance. Reduced stigma majorlyaided in decreasing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and the added benefits of a protectivefactor like marriage also greatly helped to eliminate previous stressors.IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 22The Obergefell decision greatly increased LGBTQ+ acceptance around the country afterit was made in 2015. This resulted in increases in social support for queer people that would nothave come without such a widely publicized queer rights case being on the docket. Publicsupport for gay marriage was significantly higher after the ruling, resulting in a reduction ofanti-gay attitudes overall (Kayzak & Srange, 2018; 2015). Because levels of prejudice towardLGBTQ+ people usually trend downward in countries with legalized same-sex marriage, theU.S. experienced a similar shift in public opinion and those with previously bigoted beliefschanged their minds to match the state of policy (Hooghe & Meeusen, 2013; Kreitzer, Hamilton,& Tolbert, 2014; Flores & Barclay, 2016). The shift massively helped in terms of creating anenvironment where queer identity could flourish, and the psychosocial benefits of the SupremeCourt Ruling could occur.As a result of the increased acceptance realized through the court ruling, queer Americansfound that they were more openly able to express their identities. Being able to express one’s selfcontributes to wellbeing, and a study of around a thousand couples in same-sex marriages foundthat state recognition of marriage was significantly associated with less identity concealment andvigilance (Riggle et al., 2017). In a study that conducted qualitative interviews with 20 sexualminority women, it was observed that it felt safer to be out after Obergefell in the workplace, insocial interactions, and in their community (Wooton et al., 2018). They also expressed a feelingof “normalization”, instead of feeling othered as previously indicated, and an expectation ofequality and tolerance (Wooton et al., 2018). Another study, with a sample of 288 LGBTindividuals, indicated in a survey that legally recognized same-sex marriages strengthened theparticipants confidence in their relationships and made them feel more real and valid in society(Lanutti 2018). Identity centrality and partner support became important parts of queer people’sIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 23lives after Obergefell according to Riggle et al.’s study. This ability to express oneself moreopenly is a direct result of the more accepting socio-political environment that the 2015 decisioncreated (Riggle, 2017). In a study of nurses, more of them reported their sexual orientation statusas time progressed, mirroring the trajectory of social acceptance of queer people and itssubsequent manifestation as identity expression (Charlton, Corliss, Spiegelman, Williams, &Austin, 2016). On an independent level, and a daily basis for LGBTQ+ Americans, theeverpresent stigma and oppression faded and allowed for more freedom in self expression.Perceived unrecognition faded overtime in the same way stigma did. A 2018 study with asample of 106 same sex couples measured the impacts of same-sex marriage legalization viasurvey. The idea that a certain group is inherently marginalized by society and perceived to beineligible for equal rights was a major contributing factor to previous mental health disparity, andwas disrupted after the legal precedent set by Obergefell (LeBlanc, Frost, & Bowen, 2018).Legal marriage was thereby correlated with lower levels of perceived unrecognition andconsequently, better mental health outcomes. While recognition is also a sociopolitical gain, itcame alongside decreases in psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and dysfunctionaldrinking habits (LeBlanc et al., 2018). These findings are the exact opposite of previous researchwhich measured effects of legalized same-sex marriage in states that had not put a marriage banin place under the Defense of Marriage Act (Rostosky, 2009; Rostosky, 2010; Wight, 2012). Thissolidifies marriage equality’s benefits and furthers the case for why it was so important. Tofurther this component of perceived unrecognition in the vein of minority stress, the Defense ofMarriage Act contributed to stress by failing to recognize the legitimacy of LGBTQ+ marriages.In the case of Obergefell, minority stress greatly decreased due to a more supportive environmentthat recognized marriages that did not fit the heteronormative standard (Everett, Hatzenbuehler,IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 24& Hughes, 2016). Same-sex marriage’s legality managed to strengthen not only LGBTQ+ socialinclusion, but also the mental health and wellbeing of the community.Decreases in perceived discrimination have had effects across many studies. A 2016study including 516 queer women found that this effect was correlated with others, includinglower prevalences of stigma consciousness, excessive drinking, and depressive symptoms.Decreases in discrimination have been correlated with a greater number of LGBT people whoindicated that they were happy, 87%, and greater levels of life satisfaction, 62% (WilliamsInstitute, 2018). To directly compare this to numbers that came before 2015, 84% of LGBTadults felt happy compared to 89% of non-LGBT people, and 58% of LGBT people weresatisfied with their lives compared to 68% of non-LGBT (Williams Institute, 2018). While notdrastic increases in numbers, there is a reduction in the disparity between LGBT and non-LGBTpeople, particularly in the area of life satisfaction. Whether it is the idea of being married, theability to be married, or just the recognition of equality, legalized same-sex marriage made aparticularly significant positive impact on psychological wellbeing.Marriage is a known psychological protective factor, and it applies here as well.LGBTQ+ people in marriages experienced greater feelings of social inclusion, on top of whatwas already experienced in the workplace and community (Badgett, 2011). In a study conductedin Massachusetts before Obergefell’s ruling, 19 same-sex couples indicated that they felt moresocially included, and these effects were amplified in participants with more accepting families.Given that family acceptance was also amplified after the 2015 decision, it is safe to say thatthese effects could be seen in the broader American population now. (Badgett, 2011) Queerpeople in marriages also experienced the psychosocial benefits of marriage as well, and thusreported greater wellbeing than single queer people (Wight, LeBlanc, & Badgett, 2013). This isIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 25to be expected given marriage’s protective factor status – this study’s findings show that thesame idea applies to LGBTQ+ people, which further eliminates disparities between queerAmericans and non-LGBTQ+ Americans.Just as qualitative evidence supports the conclusions this thesis draws for the adversemental health impacts the Defense of Marriage Act created, such evidence supports thepsychosocial benefits of the Obergefell decision. Tracy Hollister, a gay rights advocate, stated:“It was exciting to be a part of the momentum that became unstoppable, to create apositive climate in which today's decision could be made,\" she said. \"For me, what thismeans is we are a more whole America, the promise of equal opportunity and freedomfor all Americans is more fulfilled. We LBGT Americans belong more today in the fabricof society” (CBS News, 2015, paragraph 18).This account brings a certain pride and patriotism, speaking to the America that LGBTQ+want to exist in – one that welcomes them, grants them equal rights, and sees them coexist insociety without the barrier of stigma and prejudice. Gathering at the Supreme Court contained acertain collective effervescence, a shared mood of relief and celebration that brought LGBTQ+people and allies together over a more equal country. Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff whose namenow is now synonymous with marriage equality, stated:“Thanks to the Supreme Court, a period of deep injustice in this nation is coming to aclose, but it's also clear today that there is still so much work to do. As long asdiscrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people istolerated—whether in the seeking of a marriage license, the pursuit of fairness on the job,or the fight for equal treatment at a restaurant or business—we haven't truly guaranteedIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 26equal justice under the law. But today's victory proves that anything is possible, and Icould not be more hopeful about the capacity of this country to change for the better.”(Human Rights Campaign, 2015, paragraph 4)Obergefell’s statement is hopeful and optimistic, speaking to the magnitude of what itmeans to be equal after years of fighting. However, it does not diminish the amount of work thathe and many others believe needs to be done. While he rejoices, he acknowledges thatdiscrimination policy needs to be instituted in the future. A study by Wooton et al. asked moreabout the workplace and community environments after this monumental legislation was passed:“And then it [marriage legalization] was just there… [Same-sex marriage] was just verynormal, this is what people do. So I appreciated [marriage legalization] on that level. Ifind in my day-to-day interaction, when people ask if I’m married, I say, “Yes.” Like atwork -- I find that people talk very openly about their spouses and I find, for me, I wasalways little closeted, or very closeted, whereas now it’s just like I feel emboldened tojust be out.” (Wooton, Drabble, Riggle, Veldhuis, Bitcoin, Trocki, & Hughes, 2019,paragraph 19).As more quantitative studies suggested, being “out” is associated with a certain boldnessand freeness. It is affirming to be able to be oneself in day to day interactions, as this participantsuggests, and no longer needing to be in the closet on a daily basis is especially affirming.Knowing that social acceptance mirrors policy allows LGBTQ+ people to have this confidencein self expression. Another account from the same study states:“I think it’s that idea that, maybe it’s just about me, maybe it’s about my confidence,IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 27having the legal backing to support the validity of my sexual orientation. I’m a lot moreoutspoken about it [sexual orientation] on social media and within my life. It feels morelegitimized, so I don’t have to play the game of staying in the closet or hiding, or havingthis don’t ask, don’t tell because it makes other people uncomfortable.” (Wooton, et al.,2019, paragraph 38)Again speaking to the idea of being closeted, no longer having a barrier to self expressionis affirming and validating. Social media is noted in this specific account, a nod to the role ofmedia in changing public opinion. The culture surrounding queerness changed greatly just beforeObergefell, and this perspective matches that. Having a legal marriage validates LGBTQ+identity, and allows it to exist on a more legitimate level.DiscussionComparing the Impacts of the Defense of Marriage Act and Obergefell v. HodgesThe hypothesis this thesis set out to support is correct – The Defense of Marriage Act’simpacts on mental health were largely negative, while the Obergefell v. Hodges decision’simpacts were and continue to be largely positive. Where the Defense of Marriage Act broughtpsychological strain and increases to minority stress, higher levels of internalized homophobia,lower self esteem, increases in alcohol disorders, and lower well being for LGBTQ+ Americans,the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling brought a drastic reduction in stigma and minority stress. Thisreduction returned the right of marriage to queer people, allowing them to experience thepsychological benefits it holds. It also decreased symptoms of depression and anxiety, and thefeelings of devaluement and isolation LGBTQ+ people previously felt. The feelings ofhopelessness and loneliness in the 19 years DOMA was the law of the land were replaced byIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 28soaring feelings of pride, equality, and social inclusion in 2015, as the law of the United Statescame to reflect and affirm its diversity once more.20 Years of Progress: The Shift in Tides from 1996-2015By comparing the two case studies this thesis presents, it becomes abundantly clear thatthe main difference between the mental health impacts both have is the role and stance of publicopinion. While this thesis previous elaborated on changes in public opinion toward queer peopleand gains in acceptance, there is a greater level of change to explore. DOMA came in a timewhere the media portrayed queer and transgender people as jokes and when coming out was notan easy or common thing to do. The shift in public acceptance is a phenomenon that must beconsidered in completely understanding how Obergefell’s arguments were even heard by theSupreme Court, and what changes occurred before Obergefell’s impact on acceptance. While thecase’s ruling made waves in terms of public acceptance, there was an additional shift that camebefore it. Policy initiatives, social media, and community created an environment in which publicsentiment turned for the better.Policy, created by the Supreme Court, was the main outlet for legal change andacceptance of queer people between 1996 and 2015. The first political move to advance gayrights came in the 1996 Romer v. Evans ruling. Under the equal protection clause of theFourteenth Amendment, it was ruled that states could not deny queer people the basic legalprotections that any other American may recieve (Romer v. Evans, 1996). From here, a series ofseveral Supreme Court cases elevated the rights of LGBTQ+ people to protected statuses. The2003 Lawrence v. Texas case officially removed sodomy from federal law, effectively giving allAmericans their right to privacy in consensual sexual contexts (Lawrence v. Texas, 2003, HumanRights Campaign, n.d.). This decision removed the predominant form of discrimination againstIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 29queer people, a major step in the right direction. Ten years later, United States v. Windsordeclared Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional after hearing the case of EdieWindsor, whose long term partner had died and left her estate to Windsor in her will. Unable toclaim those benefits due to a ban on the federal recognition of same-sex marriage, this casereversed the negative impacts of DOMA and made federal recognition possible again (Mears,2013). These three landmark cases paved the way for Obergefell as the Supreme Court beganhearing more LGBTQ+ rights cases, putting the legal battles of queer Americans in a publicforum.The Obama administration spearheaded a push for equality 2009-2016 with otherinstances of policy. Elected in 2008, Barack Obama’s presidency brought a myriad of equalitycentered policies that both protected queer Americans and reversed laws of the past, such as theMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 and the Don’t Ask,Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010 (Zeleny, 2009, U.S. Senate, 2010). Obama officially named Juneas LGBT Pride Month, matching his social policy with his legislation as well (White House,2009). Barack Obama was also the first president to mention marriage equality in his inauguralpresidential address, a major move given Obama’s previous anti-same-sex marriage stance(Human Rights Campaign 2013). As the first president of color, Obama himself representedsocial change and progress, and his actions line up with that sentiment.Social media was the predominant outlet for advocacy at this time, in an era withincreased digital reliance. This meant that advocacy could have immense reach and visibility aswell. Political organizing via interest groups or protests were no longer the only way to makeLGBTQ+ voices heard. The Human Rights Campaign created the hashtags #LoveWins and#LoveCantWait, which have been used millions of times to speak to the public outpour ofIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 30support for marriage equality (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.). Stories told on Twitter, Instagram,and Facebook using the hashtags have become first hand accounts of pride, struggle, andempowerment for LGBT Americans. It has made experiences that were formerly tough to shareas easy as making a post, and it has worked. HRC’s red logo, a symbol of love, has been sharedover 18 million times by not just LGBTQ+ people, but their allies (Human Rights Campaign,2015). Social media made awareness of queer issues exponentially more accessible, allowingLGBTQ+ Americans to raise their voices in the fight and change their own public image.Public figures also had a major role in advancing public acceptance. Many celebritiesused the media as a way to share their support publically, with celebrities such as WhoopiGoldberg, the cast of Modern Family, and Busy Phillips sharing their support using HRC’stoolkits, hashtags, and logos (Human Rights Campaign 2010, 2012, 2013). Brands such as Targetand Marc Jacobs endorsed marriage equality with HRC’s help, either through statement orbroader campaigns (Human Rights Campaign, 2011, 2013). HRC’s support extended togovernors and senators, as they petitioned Congress with the red equal sign as a symbol of theirallyship (Human Rights Campaign, 2011, 2014). By the time oral arguments for Obergefell wereheard in 2015, 61% of Americans were in support of marriage equality and lifting the bansDOMA put into place as a result of this newfound visibility (Human Rights Campaign, n.d.).Queerness took back its place in society through these methods of raising awareness, via socialmedia and the platforms public figures, celebrities and government officials alike, had to use. Allresulted in pride and solidarity for the LGBTQ+ community in the face of political oppression, aswell as a desire to disrupt it.Seeing a president affirm the rights of an entire minority is crucial and invites the countryto see that same perspective. Seeing celebrities validate and endorse LGBTQ+ experienceIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 31inspires others to follow in allyship. Seeing LGBTQ+ lives in earnest, not as a joke, was thebeginning of a powerful shift. Queerness in daily life was no longer uncommon, but just anotherreality. It became obvious over an incredibly short period of time that marriage equality was anintegral equal right. A shift in cultural attitudes meant a shift in acceptance – the country thatcelebrated Obergefell v. Hodges' landmark decision greatly contrasted the one that passed theDefense of Marriage Act nearly 20 years earlier.Stigma & Minority Stress Theory in Policy and in ActionWith an understanding of the history of LGBTQ+ marginalization, mental health strain,and the effects of both in the aftermath of both the Defense of Marriage Act’s passing andObergefell v. Hodges’s ruling, the ideas of stigma and minority stress theories can be morereadily applied.As Erving Goffman stated, stigma is the “situation of the individual who is disqualifiedfrom full social acceptance” (Goffman, 1963). At the start of the 20th century, up through thebeginning of the 21st, LGBTQ+ Americans were intensely stigmatized on the basis of sexualorientation. Heteronormativity’s hegemonic place in social discourse caused queer identity to beothered, minoritized, and cast to the sidelines. When the Defense of Marriage Act, LGBTQ+Americans were othered via marriage equality stigma, with very few “wise” allies supportingand empathizing with them in the face of discriminatory legislation. They were socially shunned,resulting in the aforementioned mental health struggles –increases to minority stress, higherlevels of internalized homophobia, lower self esteem, and lower wellbeing. Even the biggestpro-gay candidates, such as Bill Clinton, became “normals”, or the oppressors withoutstigmatized identity who engaged in social shunning and the creation of devaluing policy. Stigmafaced little opposition, and social acceptance and policy were both anti-LGBTQ+ – allowing forIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 32stigmatization to occur on local, state, and national levels. The status quo of stigmatization wasdisrupted beginning with the shift in cultural tides that came with social media, advocacy, andactivism. The normalization of queer experience greatly increased numbers of the “wise”Goffman cites, in the form of straight allies, as did numbers of those who were willing to comeout as LGBTQ+ and thus as a member of the “stigmatized”. This ripple effect continued,resulting in large numbers of allies who were able to empathize, accept, and recognize the uniquechallenges that come with being LGBTQ+, as well as members of the community who wereunafraid to share their stigmatized identity. This acceptance is correlated with the levels of socialinclusion recognized in the data, as well as other studies that showed decreases in depressivesymptoms and anxiety. Once stigmatized, queer people have effectively been able to normalizetheir socially disqualified trait and evade the significant stigmas they once faced. While stigmastill exists, it has largely faded with the help of both social acceptance via activism andprogressive policy changes, as has the psychological strain of being intensely ostracized.As stigma theory posits, a collectively discriminated group is ostracized by all of societystarting with high ranking members of it. In these case studies, lawmakers oppress LGBTQ+ viaDOMA and accept them via Obergefell. Members of the government dictate law and thus socialbehavior – the acceptance of queer people in society will always mirror what the law says insome form. After prejudice was effectively removed from federal law, social acceptanceincreased as a result of not only the work of the formerly stigmatized, but also the valued andtrusted authority figures in society who made the change on a legal level.This thesis has already explained how minority stress has operated and evolvedthroughout the two case studies it focuses on, but more theoretically, affirming policy has createddecreases in the social biases minority stress thrives under. The stigmatized formerly existed inIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 33an environment that did not support their open expression, one that had few empathetic allies andone that saw little allyship from society’s authority – Congress, the president, and the SupremeCourt. After 2015, with new policy environments that allowed for the expression of queeridentity, there were fewer political avenues for oppression, although social methods still exist.Minority stress has been resolved on a policy level as far as marriage equality goes, but stillexists on a broader social level for wider LGBTQ+ issues.Conclusions & RecommendationsAs indicated in this thesis, social change and policy are inherently linked. While one doesnot necessarily precede the other, they are both necessary for the reduction of stigma in society.As seen in the case of marriage equality, what started out as another instance of oppressiontoward LGBTQ+ people has become a source of social inclusion and belonging for a historicallymarginalized group. That is not to say that the issue has been resolved, because queer Americansstill face daily hardship, but Obergefell’s ruling has massively helped to normalizenon-heternormative identity into American society. Mental health has significantly benefitedfrom anti-discriminatory policy, because of the combined benefits of social change and policy. Inorder to continue these advances, there must be both social and policy change. Because they gohand in hand, the United States will need to continue progress to both ends in order to worktowards the ultimate goal of equality for all.In order to advance social change, LGBTQ+ Americans and their allies will need tocontinue advocacy. It is their job to educate those with feelings of bias and prejudice. As seen inthe Obergefell case study this thesis considered, there were still instances of stigma even afterpublic policy caught up to public opinion. In order to truly overcome stigma, it takes time. In1996, very few queer people ever thought marriage equality would be possible – 19 years later, itIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 34was. There is hope for a country that truly accepts all Americans for who they are and who theylove, but it will only come with hard work and the patience that activism takes.Politically, LGBTQ+ Americans and their allies will need to push for change in the sameways they have already – via the courts, and via voting. Adversarial legalism has been the mainmethod by which minoritized groups have experienced policy change. Lawsuits, appeals, andworking to get a case heard by the Supreme Court have been very effective in passing decisionssuch as Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade, and Loving v. Virginia, three major civilrights cases. Additionally, voters will need to continue electing candidates that value equality asa fundamental right, and representatives that will bring those interests to state and nationallegislatures.The Human Rights Campaign, the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ nonprofit, does thissociopolitical work alongside hundreds of smaller queer rights organizations daily. Itseducational arm does the social work, while its political arm carries out the task of lobbying andelecting equality focused representatives to Congress. HRC is one of the main organizationspushing for the type of change that is necessary for equality that truly extends to all Americans –they were at the front lines of repealing DOMA, gathered at the Supreme Court as Obergefellarguments were heard, and found themselves pushing for the Respect for Marriage Act just a fewweeks ago. HRC is the encapsulation of what needs to be done next, and who Americans shouldlook to as they consider their role in advancing queer rights.Just a few days ago, President Joe Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act. Longawaited, and long necessary, the act seeks to codify same-sex marriage by stating that marriage isbetween any two people (U.S. Congress, 2022). In an address given moments after his signing,Biden said “Racism, antisemitism, homophobia, and transphobia are all connected, but theIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 35antidote to hate is love. This law and the love it defends strike a blow against hate in all itsforms, and that’s why this law matters to every single American” – the RMA stands for morethan just marriage access, but a bright horizon for equality and acceptance in a country dividedby hate. As of late, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, antisemitism, and classism have beenamplified by the same social media platforms that so many minorities share their stories on.Biden’s address directly addresses these attacks in the same way Bill Clinton’s address shortlyfollowing the Defense of Marriage does, but this time it is different. Spurred by social change,and bound to bring more, Biden’s statement is true and speaks to American democracy in waysthat Clinton’s could not. The former’s is backed by some of the most equitable policy the UnitedStates has seen in years. Equality legislation is here to stay, which means that the Equality Act isever closer to being passed.As social and political change continues, it is also important to continue tracking thebenefits of anti-discriminatory policy. Doing so is an important part of social change, and forthose who like to see evidence of change, it can sway opinion. In this thesis, it was clear thatthere is a significant lack of attention to the transgender and gender-nonconforming communityin terms of marriage equality mental health impact, but also in terms of mental health impact ingeneral. Further research needs to expand on these groups, as well as other intersections of sexand gender. Other areas of intersecting identity that should be studied with regard to marriageequality should also be age, socioeconomic status, disability status, and religion, if the field is tofully acknowledge minority stressors and intersectionality. The field should also expand onaddressing psychology’s status in assessing public health and social determinants of health.Throughout this thesis, it became apparent that a number of LGBTQ+ issues of mental health arenot widely researched, beyond just intersectional approaches to that research. In order to accountIMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 36for the significant effects policy has on queer people, further novel research should tackle otherpolicy, and draw stronger connections between public health. There is only so far reviews can goin the realm of finding new correlations. Finally, the Respect for Marriage Act should be studiedin the near future, because it could have the potential to increase the positive effects Obergefellwas shown to have. If we want sociopolitical equality, understanding how all policy affects everyAmerican is vital.IMPACTS OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY POLICY Gajda 37Works CitedAmerican Civil Liberties Union (2015). “Bourke v.

    "abstract": "The following thesis seeks to answer the question of how policy debates surrounding the rights of queer Americans affect their mental health. It also seeks to use theories of minority stress and stigma to address how these pressures appear in social and political contexts. It will draw connections between society, policy, and psychological wellbeing, looking beyond the individual and to environmental stressors as explanations for decades of mental health disparity. It will explore two particularly impactful moments in LGBTQ+ policy – the Defense of Marriage Act and Obergefell v. Hodges – in order to support the position that policy affirming the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans improves their mental health, while policy that attacks those rights harms it. Special thanks to my fall semester internship site, the Human Rights Campaign, for providing the inspiration for the topic this thesis focuses on. Throughout it, resources from the nonprofit will be featured, honoring its significance to LGBTQ+ advocacy in the United States and the journey to marriage equality",
