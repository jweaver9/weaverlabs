Hodges decision.5  June was recently an important time for the LGBTQ* community in 2020.  On June 15 of that year, the Supreme Court decided Bostock v. Clayton County,6 which asked whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII)7 prohibited employment discrimination based on one’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity.8  In a 6-3 opinion, the Court said yes.9 Upon hearing the Bostock decision, the LGBTQ* community audibly sighed in relief.  Decades of fighting to express their sexual orientation and   2. LGBTQ* here means “lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer,” with “queer” used as an umbrella term to describe the limitless identities that exist outside of rigid categories of gender and sexual orientation.

Title VII forbids employers from discriminating against employees “on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”12  Despite Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination based on “sex,” until Bostock, courts had not yet consistently expanded “sex” to include LBGTQ* status as a protected class.  In fact, until Bostock, even the Court’s most expansive readings of “sex” never explicitly included transgender and gender non-conforming people.13  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) had evolved in its own interpretations, expanding Title VII to apply to gender identity in Macy v. Department of Justice14 and further extending it to sexual orientation in 2015 in Baldwin v. Department of Transportation.15  However, the circuit courts were split on whether sexual orientation and gender identity fell into discrimination because of sex.16  Bostock affirmed the EEOC’s and certain circuits’ expansion of Title VII, finally settling this long-standing disagreement.   10.

It is important to note the difference between gender and sex. While sex relates to the biological differences between male and female bodies, gender is more complex and includes personal expression and perceptions and societal attitudes and expectations. See generally Jennifer Tseng, Sex, Gender, and Why the Differences Matter, 10 AMA J. ETHICS 427 (2008). 918 FORDHAM URB. L.J. [Vol. XLIX Bostock and its consolidated cases were considered mixed-motive cases — as are most employment discrimination cases.17  These cases involve evidence that the employer may have had both lawful and discriminatory reasons for taking a particular adverse employment action.  Courts’ standard for evaluating mixed-motive cases has evolved alongside their understanding of how workplace discrimination manifests.  The modern standard for evaluating such cases comes from the 1991 Civil Rights Act’s (1991 CRA)18 § 2000e-2(m) provision, which holds that an employee must show that her protected identity was a “motivating factor” for an employer’s adverse employment decision.19 Even with this more lenient standard, employment discrimination plaintiffs face steep hurdles in getting their cases past a defendant’s motion to dismiss.  This Note argues that the two major obstacles in succeeding past the summary judgment stage are the misplaced application of the more onerous McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green20 standard at summary judgment and the courts’ resistance to consider implicit bias when evaluating plaintiffs’ claims and employers’ same action defense.  These obstacles are particularly damaging for LGBTQ* workers who have achieved surface-level societal acceptance but still regularly combat employers’ and decisionmakers’ lingering implicit biases.21  When someone is LGBTQ* and employed at will, they are more at risk of facing such implicit biases while having little chance for remedy.22  In response, this Note suggests (1) that the 2000e-2(m) standard should be the only one   17. See Maya R. Warrier, Note, Dare to Step Out of the Fogg: Single-Motive Versus Mixed-Motive Analysis in Title VII Employment Discrimination Cases, 47 U. LOUISVILLE L. REV. 409, 424 (2008) (“[M]ixed motives are unusually prevalent in employment decision-making because (1) biased decision-making based on social-category information can occur without the decision maker’s awareness and (2) people are experts in masking behavior that is often questionable or negatively viewed by society.” (citing Michael I.

Unlike with employees with just cause protections, “employers can fire at-will employees for ‘good cause, for no cause, or even for cause morally wrong.’ An at-will employee can be discharged for a single mistake, an argument with a supervisor, an unintentional violation, off-duty conduct, or even for reasons that are patently false.” Robert M. Schwartz, Using ‘Just Cause’ to Defend Against Unfair Discipline, LABORNOTES (Jan. 15, 2019), https://labornotes.org/2019/01/using-just-cause-defend-against-unfair-discipline [https://perma.cc/2PNS-8NXE]. Employment-at-will protects inconsistent terminations and discipline, which can make it harder to establish what is an arbitrary termination and what is a discriminatory termination only thought to be arbitrary. 2022] THE RAINBOW CONNECTION 919 offered at summary judgment for mixed-motive cases and (2) that courts include implicit bias evidence in their evaluation of mixed-motive discrimination cases. Part I of this Note gives an overview of the concepts necessary for understanding its proposals.  It first examines the employment-at-will doctrine and the evolution of the mixed-motive burden of proof through Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,23 the 1991 CRA, and Desert Palace Inc. v. Costa.24  From this, it will discuss the ongoing debate amongst circuit courts on what is the proper standard for evaluating summary judgment motions for mixed-motive employment discrimination cases.  Part II then discusses potential reasons why the 1991 CRA mixed-motive standard has not “revolutionized” employment discrimination law as some scholars expected.25  It suggests that the current CRA standard is ill-suited to address the newly recognized forms of discrimination caused by implicit bias and that circuits’ continuing use of the McDonnell Douglas standard for mixed-motive cases is similarly improper.  Part II further explains how these inadequate standards particularly affect LGBTQ* plaintiffs who are superficially accepted by society but still deal with implicit anti-LGBTQ* bias, even from truly pro-LGBTQ* employers.  Part III will discuss previously offered solutions to this problem and examine how and why they fail to adequately resolve it.  Lastly, Part IV will propose that, moving forward, courts should abandon the McDonnell Douglas analysis in mixed-motive cases and instead include implicit bias analysis when reviewing employees’ prima facie mixed-motive claims and employers’ affirmative defenses. I. HISTORY A. Employment-at-Will Initially adopted from English law, employment-at-will’s (EAW) U.S. counterpart began to diverge from its European origins in the nineteenth century.26  The modern U.S. idea of termination at-will allows for an employer to terminate an at-will employee at any time for any reason (or for no reason) — except for independently unlawful grounds — without   23. 490 U.S. 228 (1989), superseded by statute, Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.

Sullivan, Making Too Much of Too Little?: Why “Motivating Factor” Liability Did Not Revolutionize Title VII, 62 ARIZ. L. REV. 357 (2020).  26. See Jay M. Feinman, The Development of the Employment at Will Rule, 20 AM. J. LEGAL HIST. 118, 118 (1976). 920 FORDHAM URB. L.J. [Vol. XLIX incurring legal liability.27  Likewise, an employee may leave an at-will job at any time for any or no reason without adverse legal consequences.28  All U.S. states (excluding Montana) are at will,29 meaning that employees across the nation — including major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Austin, and Houston — are subject to EAW’s unpredictable nature.30 The creation and expansion of antidiscrimination law have been the most restrictive exception to an employer’s ability to hire, fire, promote, and make other employment decisions.  After all, EAW does not allow for unlawful terminations, including terminations considered discriminatory under Title VII.31  In theory, Bostock’s expansion of Title VII means that an employer cannot fire, deny promotions to, or terminate an employee because of his or her sexual orientation and gender identity.  However, this Note will demonstrate this protection may be weaker in practice than it is on paper. B. The Development of the Mixed-Motive Burden of Proof i. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins Under Title VII, there are two theories of employer motive for adverse employment actions: single and mixed.  The single-motive theory developed from the U.S. Supreme Court’s narrow interpretation of Title VII’s “because of” language.32  To the Court, “because of” meant that a single discriminatory reason motived the adverse employment action.33  The standard for evaluating such cases comes from the Supreme Court’s   27.

See Kaitlin Picco, The Mixed Motive Mess: Defining and Applying a Mixed-Motive Framework, 26 ABA J. LAB. & EMP. L. 461, 462 (2011) (explaining that this “because of” language means adverse employment actions made “because of” one of Title VII’s protected classes).  33. See id. An example of single-motive discrimination is an employer failing to promote an employee because of an attribute or feature that makes them a member of a protected class (e.g., their race) despite the employee qualifying for the promotion. 2022] THE RAINBOW CONNECTION 921 decision in McDonnell Douglas.34  Under this standard, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.35  The burden then shifts to the employer, who must articulate a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for their adverse employment action.36  Lastly, if the employer is successful in articulating this reason, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff, who — to avoid losing her case — must demonstrate that the employer’s reasoning is pretextual for discrimination.37 However, the Supreme Court reconsidered its narrow understanding of Title VII’s “because of” language in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins.38  The case centered on Ann Hopkins, a senior manager at Price Waterhouse who was proposed as a candidate for partnership.39  Despite partners in Hopkins’s office praising her character and accomplishments,40 some found her aggressive personality grating, describing her as “macho” and needing “a course at charm school.”41  The nail in the proverbial sexist coffin was when the head partner at the Washington office, Thomas Beyer, advised Hopkins to “walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry.”42  In response to what she believed to be sex-based discrimination, Hopkins filed a Title VII claim in D.C. District Court. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held in favor of Hopkins.43  However, the two courts could not agree on whether an employer was relieved of liability if it proved it would have made the same decision regardless of its discriminatory motive.44  Price Waterhouse, the losing party at both the district and circuit courts, appealed to the Supreme Court.45   34. 411 U.S. 792 (1973).  35.

See Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 237 (“The Court of Appeals . . . held that even if a plaintiff proves that discrimination played a role in an employment decision, the defendant will not be found liable if it proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination . . . . [W]hereas under the District Court’s approach, the employer’s proof in that respect only avoids equitable relief.”).  45. See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 485 U.S. 933 (1988). 922 FORDHAM URB. L.J. [Vol. XLIX Even among the Justices, there was disagreement about how to determine employer liability.46  This disagreement led to a four-justice plurality and two concurring opinions.47  The plurality opinion, written by Justice Brennan, held “because of” does not mean “solely because of[;]”48  an employer considering illegitimate and legitimate factors when making an employment decision is acting “because of” both factors.49  Therefore, a mixed-motive plaintiff could establish that her employer’s adverse employment decision was discriminatory if she could prove that her protected status “play[ed] a motivating part in [the] employment decision.”50  If the plaintiff met this initial burden, the employer could only avoid liability if it could prove that “even if it had not taken [the protected factor] into account, it would have come to the same decision.”51  To do so, the employer must provide objective evidence that the same decision would have been justified — not that the employer merely would have made the same decision absent the discriminatory motive.52  Following the D.C. Circuit’s rationale, Justice Brennan’s opinion held that if the employer proved this “same-decision” defense, it could not be liable under Title VII.53 However, Justice O’Connor’s concurrence stated that only “direct evidence” would shift the burden from the plaintiff to the defendant.54  Direct evidence is evidence that demonstrates discriminatory intent without presumption or inference;55 conversely, circumstantial evidence is evidence requiring presumption or inference, such as “statistics demonstrating a clear pattern of discriminatory effect.”56  Therefore, Justice O’Connor’s concurrence meant that an employee could only prevail on a mixed-motive action by presenting evidence explicitly showing discriminatory intent in   46.

Id. 2022] THE RAINBOW CONNECTION 923 relation to the adverse employment action.  Despite not being binding,57 Justice O’Connor’s concurrence was “treated as the operative holding of the Court,”58 with lower courts requiring plaintiffs to present direct evidence of a discriminatory motive.59 ii. The 1991 Civil Rights Act Price Waterhouse was quickly criticized for being too pro-employer; Justice Brennan’s majority allowed discriminatory employers to evade liability, while Justice O’Connor’s concurrence unfairly increased a plaintiff’s initial burden.60  However, just two years after the decision, Congress enacted the 1991 CRA.61  According to Section 3(4) of the 1991 Amendments, one of Congress’s purposes in drafting the CRA was to prevent Price Waterhouse from jeopardizing the fundamental principle of Title VII: allowing victims of proven discrimination to obtain relief and perpetrators of discrimination to be held liable for their actions.62 To do so, the 1991 CRA overrode parts of the decision, rejecting the lower courts’ adherence to Justice O’Connor’s direct evidence requirement and the meaning of Justice Brennan’s “same decision” defense.63  Congress’s more pro-plaintiff approach, codified as 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m), required that a plaintiff only prove that a protected class was a motivating factor in an adverse employment decision.64  Under this new standard, a plaintiff established a mixed-motive discrimination claim under   57.

[Vol. XLIX Title VII if he or she demonstrated that “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.”65 This lower burden on the plaintiff was paired with an affirmative remedial defense for the defendant.  Similar to Justice Brennan’s approach, Congress allowed an employer to assert a “same action” defense under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)(2)(B).66  However, Congress liberalized Brennan’s approach by still holding an employer who met this defense liable under Title VII.67  But, in such a case, a plaintiff cannot get damages or reinstatement; he or she may only receive declaratory or injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees.68 iii. Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa Despite the 1991 CRA implicitly relaxing the plaintiff’s evidentiary burden, its exclusion of Justice O’Connor’s direct evidence requirement resulted in a circuit split with the main question being whether the 1991 CRA entirely superseded Price Waterhouse’s causation standard for Title VII discrimination cases.69  Some courts continued requiring mixed-motive plaintiffs to produce direct evidence and differed on what constituted as such.70  In 2003, the Supreme Court’s opinion in Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa helped to further override the direct evidence requirement and advocated instead for Congress’s motivating factor standard.71 In the majority opinion, written by Justice Thomas, the Court affirmed the lower court’s holding that a plaintiff did not require direct evidence to obtain a mixed-motive instruction under 2000e-2(m).72  Instead, the Court held that demonstrating a motivating factor under Title VII required “meet[ing] the burdens of production and persuasion.”73  The Court even held that circumstantial evidence is “not only sufficient, but may also be more certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence.”74  Despite this overt endorsement of the 1991 CRA, the McDonnell Douglas pretext   65.

Bostock’s Effect on Title VII Seventeen years after Desert Palace, the Supreme Court decided Bostock v. Clayton County.76  Prior to Bostock, research showed a dramatic shift in U.S. residents’ views of LGBTQ* rights.77  From 1973 through 1991, there was little change in public attitudes towards the LGBTQ*, with most viewing homosexuality as being “always wrong.”78  In fact, until the 1990s and 2000s, many people in the United States limited their perception of LGBTQ* issues to a binary sphere of gay men and lesbian women; issues pertaining to the transgender community were considered separate from their gay and lesbian counterparts.79  However, after 1991, there were many rapid changes in LGBTQ* support.  For example, support for same-sex marriage went from 11% approval in 1988 to 46% in 2010.80  In 2019, 62% of U.S. residents said they have become more supportive of transgender rights in the last five years.81 Yet, despite this growing acceptance of LGBTQ* people, circuits were split on whether “sex” in Title VII extended to sexual orientation and gender identity.82  Some believed that sexual orientation and gender identity were intrinsically related to the “sex stereotype” standard announced in Price Waterhouse and revisited in Desert Palace.83  As stated by the Court in Price Waterhouse, acting on beliefs about how women and men should act inherently involves acting on the basis of gender.84   75.

Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana85 decision expanded this “sex stereotype” rationale to prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.  This case focused on Kimberly Hively — an openly lesbian, part-time, adjunct professor at an Indiana community college — who was continually not selected for a full-time position with the college.86  In response, she filed a Title VII sex-based discrimination claim against her employer.  The Seventh Circuit found for Hively under two theories.87  First, under the “comparative method,”88  Hively’s status as a lesbian represented a failure to conform to the female stereotype because she is attracted to other women, not men.89  Second, under the “associational theory,”90 the Circuit found that, just as discrimination against a member of an interracial couple implicated discrimination based on race, discrimination against gays and lesbians implicated discrimination based on sex.91 It is important to note how essential Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc.92 was to Judge Wood’s reasoning in Hively.  Coming a decade before the Seventh Circuit decision, Oncale recognized that same-sex sexual harassment was actionable under Title VII’s “because of . . . sex” prohibition.93  Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, made it clear that, while same-sex harassment was not “the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII, . . . statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils.”94  Hively’s majority expanded upon this new ground of “reasonably   85.

See id. at 345 (“Hively offers two approaches in support of her contention that ‘sex discrimination’ includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation . . . . Although the analysis differs somewhat, both avenues end up in the same place: sex discrimination.”).  88. The comparative method is when the court “attempt[s] to isolate the significance of the plaintiff’s sex to the employer’s decision” and asks whether, “holding all other things constant and changing only . . . sex,” would the plaintiff have been treated the same way?

The associational theory posits that one “who is discriminated against because of the protected characteristic of one with whom she associates is actually being disadvantaged because of her own traits.” Id. at 347. The Circuit elaborates on the evolution of this theory through the development of what constituted race discrimination. See id. at 347–49. However, the Circuit applies the theory to other Title VII protected classes as well, stating that changing the sex of one partner in a lesbian relationship would make a difference in analyzing a sex-based discrimination claim just as changing the race of one partner in an interracial marriage would.

Georgia Regional Hospital96 that discrimination based on sexual orientation was not actionable under Title VII;97 however, discrimination based on “gender nonconformity” was.98  The surprisingly blunt majority opinion denied the plaintiff’s argument that she had faced workplace discrimination because of her sexual orientation.99 The Supreme Court’s Bostock decision came only three years after the Evans decision.100  It consisted of three consolidated cases from three different circuits: the Eleventh, the Second, and the Sixth.101  The Eleventh Circuit case focused on Gerald Bostock — the titular petitioner in this long-overdue case.102  In 2003, Bostock worked as a child welfare services coordinator in Atlanta, Georgia.103  In January 2013, Bostock became involved in a gay recreational softball league.104  This involvement had influential members of the community upset.105  When his employer discovered this, he fired Bostock for conduct “unbecoming” of a county employee.106  Prior to his termination, Bostock was considered a model employee with high-scoring performance evaluations.107  After Bostock sued for sex discrimination under Title VII, the Eleventh Circuit reiterated its position in Evans and held that the statute did not prohibit employers   95.

The Second Circuit case was initiated by Donald Zarda.109  In the summer of 2010, Zarda, a gay man, worked as a sky-driving instructor at Altitude Express.110  As part of his job, Zarda regularly worked in close physical proximity to clients.111  Both Zarda and his co-workers routinely referenced sexual orientation around clients, and Zarda sometimes told female clients his sexual orientation to assuage their concerns regarding being strapped to a man for a tandem skydive.112  Altitude Express fired Zarda days after he mentioned being gay to one of his clients.113  Like Bostock, Zarda filed suit under Title VII in the Second Circuit alleging sex discrimination.114  Unlike the Eleventh Circuit, the Second Circuit held for Zarda, concluding that sexual orientation discrimination does constitute sex discrimination under Title VII.115 The Sixth Circuit case was initiated by Aimee Stephens, who worked at R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes in Garden City, Michigan.116  When she got the job, Stephens presented as a male.  But two years into her service with the company, clinicians diagnosed her with gender dysphoria and recommended that she begin living as a woman.117  In her sixth year at the funeral home, Ms. Stephens wrote a letter to her employer explaining that she planned to “live and work full-time as a woman” after returning from an upcoming vacation.118  The funeral home fired her, stating that “this is not going to work out.”119  The Sixth Circuit reached a similar   108.

The Current State of Mixed-Motive Antidiscrimination Law Bostock is an unusual employment discrimination case in that it survived until trial.  Ever since the Court’s ruling in Circuit City Stores v. Adams,121 which permitted pre-hire employment agreements, most employment discrimination cases never reach litigation.122  To be hired, many modern employees must agree to forego all rights to lawsuits and instead arbitrate.123  This style of alternate dispute resolution is known as mandatory arbitration and bars access to the courts for all types of legal claims, including Title VII discrimination claims.124  In 2018, over 55% of workers were subject to mandatory arbitration, meaning that 60.1 million American workers had no court access and instead had to arbitrate their employment disputes, including discrimination.125 Of the few employment discrimination cases that do make it to litigation, most are decided at summary judgment.126  When the court grants an employer’s motion for summary judgment, it decides that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact pertaining to the allegedly discriminatory decision.127  Granting this motion also ends the plaintiff’s employment discrimination claim.128  Despite the seemingly settled Title VII mixed-motive standard used at trial, circuits are split on how to evaluate these cases at the summary judgment stage.129  The Supreme   120.

Liberty Lobby likely contributed to the split.130  In Anderson, the Court held that, when ruling on summary judgment, a “judge must view the evidence presented through the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden.”131  Therefore, at summary judgment, trial courts determine not only if there is a factual dispute present but also if the plaintiff has satisfied their evidentiary burden of proof.132 However, with the differing burdens elaborated in Price Waterhouse, 1991 CRA, and Desert Palace (and perhaps judicial stubbornness to congressional override),133 lower courts clashed on what a mixed-motive plaintiff’s burden was and what evidence satisfied it.  Of this split, only the Eighth Circuit has held that Desert Palace had no impact on prior Eighth Circuit decisions.134  Therefore, the Circuit held in Griffith v. City of Des Moines135 that a plaintiff with direct evidence of illegal discrimination survived summary judgment.136  If the plaintiff has no direct evidence, she must instead “creat[e] the requisite inference of unlawful discrimination through the McDonnell Douglas analysis.”137 Instead of outright rejecting the 1991 CRA framework, the Fifth Circuit created a modified mixed-motive analysis, merging both the McDonnell Douglas’s and Desert Palace’s approaches.138  The case establishing this merged analysis, Rachid v. Jack in the Box, Inc.,139 held that plaintiffs with only circumstantial evidence of discrimination must proceed under the first two steps in McDonnell Douglas. Supposing the plaintiff is successful, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate reason for its decision.  The last step of the analysis allows plaintiffs to offer evidence that the employer’s proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination (as available under McDonnell Douglas) or only one of the reasons for its conduct.140   130. 477 U.S. 242 (1986).  131.

Circuits, plaintiffs may instead choose to establish their case under one of two standards.142  For the Fourth Circuit, a plaintiff can survive summary judgment either by presenting direct or circumstantial evidence that “raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an impermissible factor . . . motivated the employer’s adverse employment decision”143 or by using the McDonnell Douglas approach.  The Seventh Circuit has a similar binary set-up, with McDonnell Douglas used for the “indirect” method of proving mixed-motive discrimination and direct or circumstantial evidence used for the “direct” method.144  The Ninth Circuit allows a similar choice; plaintiffs may proceed under the McDonnell Douglas framework or “may simply produce direct or circumstantial evidence demonstrating that a discriminatory reason more likely than not motivated [the employer].”145  The D.C. Circuit has an analogous two-option procedure.146 However, only two circuits have explicitly and totally rejected the McDonnell Douglas standard: the Sixth and the Eleventh Circuit.  In White v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.,147 the Sixth Circuit decided that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis was unnecessary for proving mixed-motive claims and similarly did not apply to such claims at summary judgment.148  Instead, the Sixth Circuit held a position consistent with § 2000e-2(m)’s motivating factor standard.149   141.

(quoting White, 553 F.3d at 400). 932 FORDHAM URB. L.J. [Vol. XLIX While the Eleventh Circuit initially agreed with the Eighth Circuit’s application of the McDonnell Douglas, it more recently reversed this opinion in Quigg v. Thomas County School District.150  Relying on the Sixth Circuit’s decision in White, the Quigg Court reasoned that, to properly evaluate such claims, it should “ask only whether a plaintiff offered evidence sufficient to convince a jury that: (1) the defendant took an adverse employment action against the plaintiff; and (2) [a protected characteristic] was a motivating factor for the defendant’s adverse employment action.”151  Overall, while Desert Palace was initially hailed as McDonnell Douglas’s executioner,152 few circuits have truly shelved the McDonnell Douglas standard in its entirety. II. THE GAPS IN THE CURRENT MIXED-MOTIVE STANDARD A. Implicit Bias and Modern-Day Discrimination Despite the growing acceptance of 2000e-2(m)’s more lenient standard, plaintiffs’ attorneys shy away from using the mixed-motive standard.153  This reluctance is due, in part, to 2000e-2(m)’s structure subjecting attorneys’ clients to an employer’s remedy-limiting affirmative “same-action” defense.154  Judge Mark W. Bennett has described the motivating factor standard as a “Trojan horse” whose lower burden comes with the real possibility that a successful plaintiff may walk away with no monetary relief.155  Because of 2000e-2(m)’s affirmative defense, Judge Bennett “doubts that many plaintiffs will be willing to run the risk of prevailing on liability, but still receiving no monetary compensation for their efforts.”156 This conflict of choice should be less apparent at the summary judgment stage since plaintiffs are not forced to make a final decision between the McDonnell Douglas and 2000e-2(m) litigation structures; if a triable issue exists under either standard, the motion should be denied.157  Despite this alleged freedom, plaintiffs’ employment discrimination claims are still   150. 814 F.3d 1227 (11th Cir. 2016): see also Wise & Meier, supra note 141.  151.

See id. at 396 n.164. 2022] THE RAINBOW CONNECTION 933 routinely dismissed at summary judgment.158  This may be in part because courts deciding employment law summary judgment motions often view the evidence in a piecemeal manner and apply “formalistic rigidity to a complex and elusive phenomenon like workplace discrimination.”159 Additionally, most discrimination cases no longer hinge on explicit discrimination from employers.160  Instead, modern employers may now act on unconscious biases, prompting adverse employment decisions they believe to be nondiscriminatory but are actually based in prejudice.  Justice Ginsburg stated this phenomenon in simple yet eloquent terms: “Managers, like all humankind, may be prey to biases of which they are unaware.”161  Therefore, judges’ piecemeal method of reviewing evidence may explain why so many cases are dismissed at summary judgment; the wrongs Title VII was enacted to combat have changed, and judges have not yet adapted accordingly. This form of unconscious bias, also known as implicit bias, causes people to “act on the basis of prejudice and stereotypes without intending to.”162  The application of implicit bias is not limited to the social psychology sphere; many legal scholars have acknowledged how it might affect the application of the law.163  Some scholars have tied implicit bias to the theory of behavioral realism.164  In the context of antidiscrimination law, behavioral realism proposes that judges “remain continuous with progress in psychological science” and periodically revisit “judicial   158.

No longer do employers discriminate with smoking gun statements like: “This is no job for a woman” or “Irish need not apply.”166  Employers are aware that such statements will almost always be understood as discriminatory under Title VII,167 and many now have formal policies that prohibit discrimination and set procedures to enforce those policies.168  Rather than coming from a deliberate and overt bias, implicit bias causes employers to unconsciously discriminate against their employees and potentially not even realize it. Raiders’ coach Jon Gruden is a modern example of a potentially unaware, discriminatory employer.  In numerous emails during a seven-year period starting in 2011, Gruden casually used homophobic slurs.169  In these emails, he called the National Football League’s (NFL) commissioner, Roger Goodell, the f-slur, which is derogatory against LGBTQ* peoples, particularly gay men.170  Gruden also said that Goodell should not have pressured Jeff Fisher — then coach of the Rams — to draft “queers” in reference to the team choosing Michael Sam, a gay man, to play for the team in 2014.171  In a statement issued on the Raiders’s Twitter, Gruden said about the emails: “I’m sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone.”172 For present purposes, the Note accepts Gruden’s belated apology at face value without considering its pretext of discrimination.  While Gruden’s use of slurs is explicit bias,173 both the timing of his comments and his professed ignorance about its effects suggests that his anti-LGBTQ* bias   165. Id.  166.

For example, during the time of Gruden’s leaked emails, the term “gay” was frequently used to describe something or someone as “lame,” “uncool,” or, in Gruden’s case, “weak.”174  Therefore, Gruden may believe that, in using homophobic slurs, he was not directly disparaging the sexual orientation.  Yet, by associating the term “gay” with these negative terms, Gruden was inherently stereotyping gay people as “lame,” “uncool,” and “weak.”175  Furthermore, by using a slur with a history of oppressing sexual minorities, Gruden disparaged the LGBTQ* community as lesser than their heterosexual counterparts.176 Furthermore, Gruden’s professed ignorance about the harms of his comments suggests he might not have been aware of his own bias’s impact.177  Yet, during the time of his comments, Gruden was highly influential in the league.178  As a head coach, Gruden wielded great influence over the player composition of his coached teams.  In fact, along with the team’s general manager, Gruden had the final say on drafting, retaining, and removing players.179  With this amount of influence, it is possible that Gruden’s disparaging language was not the full extent of the   174.

It is also possible that Gruden’s thinking evolved from 2011 to 2018 — from being expressly homophobic to accepting certain societal changes. As Tessa Charlesworth and Mahzarin Banaji’s article demonstrates, implicit views towards LGBTQ* people have rapidly changed from negative to positive. See generally Tessa E. S.

Despite his private association of gay men with weakness, Gruden publicly posited himself as a proponent of LGBTQ* rights.  For example, in June 2021, Carl Nassib, the Raiders’s defensive lineman, publicly declared he was gay.180  In response to Nassib coming out,181 Gruden, who was then the Raiders’s head coach, publicly said that he had “learned a long time ago what makes a man different is what makes him great.”182  If Gruden’s emails had not been leaked, the public might have continued perceiving him as a supporter of gay rights.  This dichotomy between Gruden’s private and public persona may have resulted from his internal desire and society’s external pressure to be seen as unbiased despite his true prejudice against the LGBTQ* community.183  Having his private behavior supported by his co-workers likely also acted as an implicit endorsement that such behavior was acceptable.184 B.

By dismissing the employee’s claim, the courts fail to correct implicitly biased and discriminatory behavior, which can perpetuate discrimination, particularly aversive discrimination, which may result from implicit bias.186  Aversive discrimination is a “subtle, often unintentional form of bias that is different from ‘old-fashioned’ or overt racism or discrimination.”187 Because there is no “smoking gun” with implicit bias, state and federal courts have struggled to find an effective way to evaluate this potential unconscious bias.188  In some circumstances, the use of implicit bias is outright barred; for example, the Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes189 decision set a precedent against using evidence of implicit bias to establish commonality amongst a class in a class action suit.190  Prior to Dukes, implicit bias evidence was regularly used in employment discrimination claims.191  However, the Supreme Court held that such evidence was insufficient to support a theory of commonality amongst plaintiffs.192  Thankfully, Dukes did not bar implicit bias evidence from individual plaintiffs’ discrimination claims.193  Outside class certification, plaintiffs continue to use implicit bias evidence as proof of discrimination when explicit forms are absent.194 However, not all courts have been so reluctant towards including implicit bias in Title VII discrimination analysis, even in class certification.  Prior to the Dukes decision, the Southern District Court of New York addressed a similar problem in Velez v. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.195    185.

[Vol. XLIX In Velez, a group of 62,000 female employees claimed that their employer’s “personnel evaluation and management system [was] overly subjective, and that this subjectivity [led] to discrimination.”196  David Martin, the plaintiffs’ offered expert, analyzed the employer’s policies for “vulnerab[ility] to bias in decision[-]making” and found that there was potential for discrimination.197  While alone this evidence was not sufficient, combined with the plaintiff’s statistical and anecdotal evidence, the court supported the class certification.198  While the Velez decision did not explicitly mention implicit bias, its recognition of how subjectivity could influence decision-making resembles how implicit bias may taint seemingly unbiased decisions. More recently, the Eastern District of Wisconsin considered the role of implicit bias in Kimble v. Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development.199  This was the first case explicitly recognizing and relying on implicit bias cognitive studies.200  In Kimble, the court evaluated the claim of an African American supervisor, Johnny Kimble, against his employer, the Equal Rights Division (ERD) of the Wisconsin Department of Workplace Development.  Kimble alleged that the ERD discriminately denied him a raise.  The court found that, while the ERD had provisions for awarding merit-based raises and bonuses, the generalness of these provisions necessitated additional, actual criteria.201  The ERD never established specific policies, which allowed the decisionmaker (who, at the time, was J. Sheehan Donoghue) to award raises and bonuses without any objective checks against their biases.202  The court’s opinion relied on the subjectivity of the Donoghue’s decision-making process and the lack of any meaningful review of her decisions.203  Given these factors, the system left “an opening through which any biases or stereotypes could infect the decision[-]making process.”204 However, courts’ reluctance to incorporate implicit bias analysis when reviewing an employee’s discrimination claim may not be the only reason for low plaintiff success.

For example, in establishing an affirmative defense, an employer may claim it would have terminated an LGBTQ* employee absent a discriminatory motive due to an employee’s lower-than-average performance evaluations.  However, Velez and Kimble, along with a 2014 study, show that an unconsciously biased decisionmaker may evaluate certain employees — such as those belonging to racial out-groups or sexual minorities — more harshly, resulting in lower performance evaluation despite similar workstyles and productivity.206 C. Relevance to the LGBTQ* Community As discussed in this Note’s introduction, LGBTQ* history has been rife with fighting for long-deserved rights, including the right to be free from discrimination at work.  While the Bostock opinion seemingly granted this right, the judiciary’s insufficient recognition of implicit bias analysis combined with confusing summary judgment standards will particularly limit LGBTQ* plaintiffs’ ability to establish their mixed-motive cases and their right to recovery.  While increased exposure to LGBTQ* persons, legalization of same-sex marriage, and prohibition of employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity have   205. See Richard A.

According to a 2019 study conducted at Harvard University, implicit LGBTQ* bias has rapidly decreased, dropping 33% from 2007 to the end of 2016.210  However, it has not yet reached neutrality,211 meaning that the general U.S. population remains at least somewhat implicitly biased against LGBTQ* individuals.212  This lingering bias may be due, in part, to LGBTQ* identities deviating from the cultural norm of heterosexuality and cisgenderism.213  Those discomforted by such deviations may “create and defend their stereotypes to preserve or protect their normative societal model of sexuality.”214  Jillian T. Weiss, a transgender employment and civil rights lawyer, succinctly describes this modern reality: “Even if there are fewer bigots who are out to discriminate, there is still implicit bias, so some managers can’t help but see a transgender person as a weirdo.”215 Some employers attempt to combat more overt biases through antidiscrimination policies.216  However, policy alone may not be adequate   207.

Because there is no “smoking gun” with implicit bias, many aversively discriminated LGBTQ* plaintiffs will likely not have direct evidence of such discrimination.  This will force those in the Eighth and Fifth Circuits to fit their mixed-motive case into McDonell Douglas’s single-motive standard.  Even those using the 2000e-2m standard must attempt to prove a type of discrimination that courts have not widely recognized with evidence that courts usually will not accept. For LGBTQ* employees who work at will, it can be even more difficult to tell when aversive discrimination has even occurred.  This is because EAW “supports inconsistent, even irrational, management behavior by permitting arbitrary, not work-related, treatment of employees.”228  This inconsistency in behavior may allow bias to persist, as there is no standard for employees to differentiate discriminatory decisions from arbitrary ones.

Determining employer motive is especially difficult when the decisionmaker’s bias is not explicit, subjective decisions are left unchecked by objective standards, and companies’ policies appear egalitarian.  Even when reasons are given, an employee may not have access to information that would allow them to better assess the merits of their potential case.232  This can chill lawsuits in the first place since at-will employees will often be unsure of whether their termination was motivated by discrimination or, perhaps, some errant comment made the week before.233 Gruden’s case is an example of this information gap.  As noted, Gruden’s use of slurs was more explicit than the implicit bias commonly present in subjective decision-making systems.  However, he was seemingly unaware of its impacts and expressed these views outside of many employees’ purview.  Yet, Gruden could have acted on these views, even unconsciously.  Even if Gruden believed himself to not be biased against LGBTQ* individuals, his inherent characterization of gay peoples as effeminate may have influenced his decisions to not draft or retain certain players based on their sexual orientation, perceived or otherwise.  If this happened, players were likely unaware of such discriminatory motive, especially with Gruden publicly presenting himself as a proponent of LGBTQ* rights.  Furthermore, Gruden’s shift from synonymizing LGBTQ* peoples with weakness to public support of their rights is a microcosm of the larger societal acceptance of the LGBTQ* community — and just as sudden. The higher likelihood of LGBTQ* persons being in poverty also makes them more vulnerable to the harmful aftereffects of employment discrimination.  From 2014 to 2017, LGBTQ* people had a 15% to 17% higher risk of being poor than cisgender straight people.234  This risk   230. See CTR.

Rather, to avoid homelessness, medical turmoil, or further indebtedness, they must immediately begin searching for new work and filing for unemployment (if they qualify).  This urgency to find new work and the costs of litigation are likely to deter potential plaintiffs from pursuing claims, even if they are meritorious.

Even in the most “liberal” metropolitan areas, such as New York City, there may still be the bigoted employer and the discriminated employee.248  Therefore, while urban areas are more accepting than rural areas (due in part to rural United States’s lingering anti-LGBTQ conservative beliefs),249 city limits are not a shield against discrimination.   241.

Mandatory Arbitration Clauses Some have argued that the shift from litigation to arbitration has the potential to enhance equality of access to justice for employees.250  Arbitration differs from traditional litigation in that there is “more limited discovery, less frequent use of summary judgment motions, and less stringent application of the rules of evidence.”251  While this seemingly addresses employment discrimination cases’ frequent dismissals at summary judgment, the reality of arbitration proves different. The defining characteristic of mandatory arbitration is that the employer unilaterally creates its procedure as a term and condition of employment.252  This includes choosing which, if any, arbitrator service provider will administer the arbitrator and the rules of conduct for the arbitration.253  While unionized workplaces have a polarizing force of a union in the labor arbitrator selection process, this is absent in nonunion workplaces.254  Therefore, compared to larger employers who more frequently participate in employment arbitration, individual nonunion employees are at a distinct disadvantage.255 Employers are also systematically much more likely to be repeat players in arbitration, especially employers enforcing mandatory arbitration.256  Because arbitrators repeatedly see the same employers, they might tend to favor employers in arbitration in the hopes of securing future business.257  In a unionized workplace, this favoritism is offset by unions also being repeat players.258  However, it is rare for an individual employee to be a repeat arbitration participant, meaning there is no counterbalance in nonunionized workplaces.259   250.

According to a 2011 study,260 employees won261 only 21.4% of employer-promulgated arbitration procedures — compared to the 36.4% win rate for federal court litigations.262  This employee win rate drops further during a “repeat-employer-arbitrator pairing” in which an employer has previously used an arbitrator.263  Among cases in which the employee received some amount of monetary damages, the median amount was $36,500, and the mean award was $109,858.264  This is far lower than the damages awarded in employment litigation, which had a median award of $150,500.265 Furthermore, the arbitration system undermines one of the public policy goals of antidiscrimination law, which is to deter and educate prospective violators.266  Arbitration is a private system with generally confidential outcomes.267  Unlike courts, members of the public cannot attend   260. This study focused on arbitration decisions published by the American Arbitration Association in compliance with Section 1281.96 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. “Under the California Civil Procedure Code, organizations that provide arbitration services within the state are required to make available to the public certain prescribed information on arbitration cases administered by the service provider that involve consumers.” See Colvin, supra note 256, at 3. This information includes: [T]he name of the employer, the name of the arbitrator, the prevailing party, the amount awarded, and whether the employee was self-represented. However, information regarding employee characteristics, types of claims being filed (e.g., FLSA, contract, Title VII), and the arbitrator’s complete written award are not covered by these disclosure requirements. See Colvin & Gough, supra note 254, at 1026. The study analyzes 3,945 arbitration cases, of which 1,213 were decided by an award after a hearing, filed and reaching disposition between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2007. See Colvin, supra note 256, at 4.

[Vol. XLIX arbitration hearings, and there is no public record of filings, the hearing, or the award.268  Therefore, even the rare arbitration decisions in favor of the employee are only known to the parties of the suit.  This privacy undercuts the deterrent effect found in public court decisions.  For example, an employer publicly sanctioned through litigation for racial discrimination in hiring “may deter another employer from gender discrimination in hiring or, indeed, in promotions”269 and “stigmatizes the violator . . . [deterring] other employers who seek to avoid that same stigma.”270  Conversely, in arbitration, there is no public knowledge of this sanction.  Both the lack of a public record of arbitration proceedings and decisions and the fact that employers are rarely sanctioned in arbitration make arbitration a less than promising alternative to litigation. B. In-House & Educational Solutions Daniel Masakayan, an employer-side associate at McGuireWoods, LLP who has frequently written about employment issues,271 argues that using Title VII to address aversive discrimination would only further burden plaintiffs and potentially worsen discrimination.272  He cites Supreme Court precedent, such as Dukes and Price Waterhouse, stating that the Court has only provided “insufficient guidance” in these cases.273  To Masakayan, this “insufficient guidance . . . results in uncertainty for courts and additional barriers for victims of unconscious discrimination.”274 While admirable for its outside-of-court focus, Masakayan’s solution of using education and training towards eliminating implicit bias may allow biased employers to exert subjective discretion on educational programs and trainings.275  If employers and decisionmakers are unconsciously discriminating against LGBTQ* employees, then placing employers in a position to determine what programs correct implicit bias may do little to mitigate discrimination.  Furthermore, two-thirds of human resource specialists report that diversity training has no positive effects.276   268. See id.  269. Id. at 431.  270. Id. (citing PAUL H.

After all, unlearning unconscious bias requies altering one’s subconscious, which likely requires more than one training session about implicit bias.277  In response, advocates of anti-bias trainings, like Masakayan, may argue for longer curriculums.  While longer-term curriculums have been shown to reduce bias,278 employers may be resistant to costly programs.279  For example, Starbucks, which closed 8,000 stores for half a day to train 175,000 workers, lost $12 million in doing so.280  To match the recommended curriculum best suited for reducing bias, they would need a dozen half-day sessions, every year, for more than half the workforce, which grows by 10,000 new workers every year.281  While any reasonable employer seeks to mitigate employment discrimination claims, the costs associated with implementing effective anti-bias trainings are likely too untenable. Similarly, Masakayan’s suggestion of teaching students about implicit bias early and exposing them to diverse groups through the education system is laudable in principle but difficult in practice.282  It is true that contact and exposure with out-groups, such as sexual minorities, mitigates bias but only when that contact is actual and sustained.283  Simply being in an area with a higher gay population will not impact bias.284  Therefore, for Masakayan’s proposal to work, students must have long-term exposure to out-groups. However, implementing programs with long-term exposure to these out-groups may be difficult.  Affirmative action policies that prioritize sexual minorities in admissions may be deemed unconstitutional under the Supreme Court’s strict judicial standard.285  The recent Supreme Court ruling in Fisher v. University of Texas286 held that colleges must demonstrate that they are using race in admissions only when “necessary,”   277. See id. at 49.  278. See id. (citing Patricia G.

IV. HOW TO APPLY TITLE VII TO THE MODERN ERA A. Including Implicit Bias in the 2000e-2(m) Standard As previously discussed in Section II.C, LGBTQ* people are particularly at risk of having their claims improperly dismissed.  Some courts, like those involved in Kimble and Velez, have begun to understand the importance of including implicit bias in their analysis.  Courts that recognize implicit bias evidence usually analyze it through expert witness testimony, as done in Kimble.291  Since it is at the summary judgment stage where most discrimination cases falter,292 it is important to know whether such testimony is applicable pre-trial.  Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, expert witnesses are allowed to testify on summary judgment.293  The evidence submitted in connection with summary judgment also does not necessarily have to be presented in an admissible   287.

P. 56; see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993) (applying expert testimony admissibility standard to expert affidavits in motion for summary judgment). 2022] THE RAINBOW CONNECTION 951 form.294  This means that, even if an expert witness’s testimony would not be admitted in its current form in a normal trial, it can be supplementary to other evidence offered by the plaintiff at the summary judgment stage. Even Price Waterhouse indirectly included evidence of implicit bias through an expert witness.295  During trial, Dr. Susan Fiske, a social psychologist and Associate Professor of Psychology at Carnegie-Mellon University, testified about how sex stereotyping affected the Price Waterhouse’s partnership selection process.296  According to Dr. Fiske, “the subjectivity of the evaluations made it likely that sharply critical remarks such as [those experienced by Hopkins] were the product of sex stereotyping.”297  This subjectivity assessment later surfaces in the courts’ decision in Kimble298 and Velez.299  Therefore, the Supreme Court, whether intentionally or not, left the door open for expert witnesses to demonstrate implicit bias. However, expert witnesses are expensive, and many plaintiffs cannot afford them.300  Instead, courts could allow a plaintiff to establish a Title VII discrimination claim through implicit bias evidence and view an employer’s “same-action” defense in light of this demonstrated bias.  Implicit bias analysis under Title VII could be introduced either through (1) federal judges educating themselves about its impacts and, subsequently, incorporating it into their decisions or (2) amendments to Title VII explicitly advocating for its inclusion.  In assessing discrimination cases, judges already rely on “intuitive” or “common sense” psychological theories in constructing and justifying their application of legal doctrines.301  Therefore, incorporating implicit bias — a well-known302   294.

Lessard Design, Inc., 790 F.3d 532, 539 (4th Cir. 2015), as amended (June 24, 2015) (finding that the district court did not err in considering experts’ reports at summary judgment as the admissibility of the reports is immaterial if the anticipated admissible form is explained by submitting party).  295. 490 U.S. 228, 235 (1989).  296.

According to the SEAK’s 2017 National Guide to Expert Witness Fees and Billing Procedures, the median testimony hourly fee for non-medical expert witnesses is $275/hour.

Furthermore, 31% of all experts (including medical) charge a minimum number of hours for trial testimony. See id. These high costs may dissuade a plaintiff from using expert witness testimony.  301. See Krieger & Fiske, supra note 164, at 1006. 952 FORDHAM URB. L.J. [Vol. XLIX phenomenon based on decades of scientific research303 — is simply an extension of applying these “common sense” theories. Altering how judges analyze discrimination cases by incorporating a third step to the 2000e-2(m) mixed-motive analysis could be a way for judges to apply an implicit bias analysis.  For example, in Lapsley v. Columbia University-College of Physicians & Surgeons,304 the Southern District of New York proposed such a process for determining whether discrimination, “subtle or otherwise,”305 exists.  First, the jury evaluates the proof offered by the plaintiff, whether direct or circumstantial.  The jury then evaluates the defendant’s evidence that no discrimination occurred in making its decision.  Finally, the jury ponders the evidence as a whole, rather than separately, in deciding whether actual discrimination occurred or whether a sufficient inference can be drawn supporting an “ultimate” finding of intentional discrimination. Judges could include implicit bias analysis by applying an altered Lapsley analysis when assessing mixed-motive summary judgment motions.  At summary judgment, courts could evaluate an employer’s “same-action” defense through the lens of the plaintiff’s prima facie case, which can also be established through evidence of implicit bias, such as highly subjective decision-making.306  For example, assume a gay male plaintiff established that his employer evaluated gay men more harshly than their heterosexual counterparts in performance reviews.  Upon reviewing the employer’s defense, the court should be skeptical of any assertion that the employer would have made the same decision because of the plaintiff’s low evaluations. Conversely, Congress could legislatively incorporate implicit bias by following in its footsteps and issuing an act like the 1991 CRA.  One strategy could be overriding the Dukes precedent, which some consider a   302. See Jerry Kang, What Judges Can Do About Implicit Bias, 57 CT. REV. 78, 78 (2021) (“But now, the idea of implicit bias circulates widely in both popular and academic discussions. Even the casually interested judge knows a great deal about the topic.”).  303.

Removing McDonnell Douglas from Mixed-Motive               Summary Judgments While the 2000e-2(m) standard has been embraced by most circuits, many still offer the McDonnell Douglas standard in some variation at the summary judgment stage.  However, applying the McDonnell Douglas pretext standard contradicts Congress’s intention in enacting Title VII and clarifying the mixed-motive standard in the 1991 CRA.  In Wright v.

Baxter decision, Judge Moore, writing for the majority and a separate concurring opinion, observed that McDonnell Douglas’s pretext framework might unjustly terminate some mixed-motive claims at summary judgment.310 In her concurrence, Judge Moore concisely described the flaws of both the Fifth Circuit’s modified and the Eighth Circuit’s unmodified McDonnell Douglas approach, offering a hypothetical circumstance where a discriminatory reason played some role in a plaintiff’s adverse employment decision.311  While the plaintiff may not be able to assert a prima facie case, they might still be able to present evidence that a discriminatory reason motivated the decision.312  Analyzing this claim under McDonnell Douglas would bar what would otherwise be a successful mixed-motive claim.313  McDonnell Douglas is aimed at “smoking out” the   307.

[Vol. XLIX single, ultimate reason for adverse employment; mixed-motive claims do not fit neatly into such a narrow framework.314 Applying the rationale of Judge Moore’s concurrence to a real-life hypothetical better illustrates her points.  Assume that an LGBTQ* plaintiff files a Title VII mixed-motive discrimination claim in the Eighth Circuit.  She claims that her employer discharged her because she is LGBTQ*, though her employer claims her discharge was because of budget cuts.  Even if the plaintiff can prove that her employer terminated her in a discriminatory manner, her employer can rebut her prima facie case by producing, not proving, a nondiscriminatory reason for its decision, such as the aforementioned budget cuts.  The plaintiff is now left with the grueling task of demonstrating that her employer’s proffered reason was pretextual for the “true,” discriminatory reason.  If there are multiple reasons for her termination — such as her LGBTQ* status and budget cuts — the plaintiff will fail her case and the employer will walk away, free from liability, despite their proven discrimination. Circuits that offer an open choice between McDonnell Douglas and a motiving factor framework may also confuse plaintiffs since they are not clearly directed to choose either.  Fogg v. Gonzales315 demonstrates how this indecision can stymie lower courts.316  In the case, the defendant filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law.317  In their motion, the defendant mentioned pretext,318 though they did not want the trial court to use a pretext framework.319  However, because of the mention of pretext, the judge nonetheless applied McDonnell Douglas.320  What is particularly odd in this case is that it is the plaintiffs who should choose which theory applies, which even the opinion itself recognizes.321  To ameliorate this confusion and potential backlogging of the judicial system, circuits should analyze mixed-motive cases under only the motivating standard and not offer McDonnell Douglas. For these reasons, McDonnell Douglas should be removed entirely from the mixed-motive analysis.  This removal may be done through courts relying more heavily on Desert Palace’s endorsement of the 2000e-2(m)   314. See id. at 720.  315. 492 F.3d 447 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  316. See Thomas F.

C. Legislative History Supports Including Implicit Bias and Excluding McDonnell Douglas in Mixed-Motive Cases Since its enactment, Title VII has expanded to encompass newly recognized forms of discrimination.  While Congress has, at times, restricted Title VII,322 it has never overridden an expansive Supreme Court interpretation — only ones that Congress did not see as expansive enough.323  For example, in 1978, Congress amended Title VII to include pregnancy discrimination as unlawful sex discrimination — overriding the Court’s more restrictive views on such discrimination.324 The 1991 CRA House Report stated that “[i]f Title VII’s ban on discrimination in employment is to be meaningful, proven victims of intentional discrimination must be able to obtain relief, and perpetrators of discrimination must be held liable for their actions.”325  Yet, as we have seen, Title VII’s current interpretive state does not actually offer victims effective relief, nor does it hold perpetrators liable.  Due to their reluctance to accept implicit bias evidence, judges may routinely dismiss meritorious cases at summary judgment, leaving victims remediless.  Even when the stray case moves to trial, plaintiffs who choose the 2000e-2(m) method risk losing any monetary recovery, while those opting for McDonnell Douglas face steeper evidentiary standards ill-suited for mixed-motive cases. Some may argue that Title VII never guaranteed monetary relief to successful plaintiffs.326  However, declaratory and injunctive relief only prevent future violations without addressing the employer’s past misconduct’s effects on the plaintiff.  Common types of injunctive relief,   322. When enacting Title VII, Congress included restrictive provisions as compromises “in order to pass expanded prohibition against discrimination.” George Rutherglen, Title VII as Precedent: Past and Prologue for Future Legislation, 10 STAN.

Congress only rejected restrictive interpretations that cut back on the previous expansions of the law . . . .

[Vol. XLIX such as mandating an employer establish an antidiscrimination policy,327 may also fail to adequately remedy the aversive discrimination previously described.328  This is not to say that all plaintiffs must be reinstated or given backpay to be made whole; if offered, many plaintiffs may reasonably refuse to be reinstated at a discriminatory workplace.329 However, Congress noted the importance of allowing private litigation when it enacted the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976 (Attorney’s Fees Act),330 which authorized fee-shifting in favor of prevailing plaintiffs.331  Prior to the Act, courts used the “American rule,” in which litigants typically bore their own fees and expenses incurred in litigation regardless of their success on the merits.332  The Attorney’s Fees Act was meant to incentivize private attorneys to litigate in favor of plaintiffs alleging a variety of civil rights claims, including discrimination.333  By assuring that attorneys would receive their fees, even if their plaintiffs’ claims did not succeed, Congress hoped that private attorneys would be more willing to take on such cases.334  Despite these attempts to incentivize plaintiffs’ attorneys to litigate discrimination claims, the current difficulty in establishing discrimination claims actively dissuades private attorneys from taking on such cases.335  Introducing implicit bias evidence not only modernizes the plaintiff’s evidentiary burden, but plaintiffs’ attorneys, knowing they have a better shot of establishing a successful claim with admissible implicit bias evidence, may   327.

See supra notes 216–18 and accompanying text.  329. This may be due in part to the psychological injuries suffered because of discrimination.

D. Including Implicit Bias Analysis in Mixed-Motive Cases Will Not Overburden Employers’ Decision-Making Abilities Employers may perceive courts’ analysis of implicit bias as improperly restricting their decision-making abilities.  Title VII discourse has long been concerned about “thought control,” which argues that Title VII sanctions employers “for having a biased individual in a position to hire or fire, regardless of whether any of his decisions are influenced by his beliefs.”336  Scholars against including implicit bias under 2000e-2(m) point to the House Judiciary Committee’s statement that “[2000e-2(m)] would not make mere discriminatory thoughts actionable.”337  Yet, when acted upon, implicit bias is not “mere discriminatory thoughts.”  As this Note showed, implicit bias can influence workplace dynamics, performance evaluations, hiring processes, and, ultimately, terminations.  This Note does not seek to penalize employers for having implicit bias.  If the data collected by Harvard is to be believed, almost everyone has some form of implicit bias — even the LGBTQ* employees being discriminated against.338  It is the acting upon it, subconsciously or otherwise, that should be understood and remedied. Employers may argue that there are no sufficient ways to prevent implicit bias in the workplace beyond trainings, which have been shown to be either insufficient in preventing bias or not financially feasible for most employers.339  However, the first step toward addressing implicit bias is acknowledging that it exists.340  By acknowledging implicit bias in their   336.

L.J. [Vol. XLIX employment discrimination analysis, the judiciary may spur employers to conceive of better ways to manage implicit bias or, at the very least, have them think twice about whether their employment decisions are truly bias-free. Some legal scholars have argued that Bostock demonstrates that Title VII already reaches non-explicit discrimination and, therefore, adding implicit bias analysis is unnecessary.341  However, this argument relies on discrimination that, while not explicitly stated, is still readily observable.  In all three cases consolidated in Bostock, the employees’ termination occurred after their sexual orientation and gender identity were discovered by the employer.  It is not outlandish to assume that such termination is “because of” sex.  However, with more complicated cases, like that of Kimble, Velez, and even Price Waterhouse, implicit bias is an essential component of a fair assessment. CONCLUSION Despite the flaws in some courts’ enforcement of Title VII and the mixed-motive standard, Bostock is still a historic precedent that should be celebrated.  In providing protections for sexual orientation and gender identity, the Supreme Court furthered the U.S. values of fairness and equality to a group deserving of them.  Yet, its victory is an incomplete one.  Without changing how judges assess mixed-motive cases, LGBTQ* plaintiffs may only have superficial protection from workplace discrimination without the actual enforcement behind it.  By removing McDonnell Douglas from mixed-motive analysis and allowing for implicit bias evidence under the 2000e-2(m) standard, Bostock can truly be as momentous as the public sees it to be.   341.
