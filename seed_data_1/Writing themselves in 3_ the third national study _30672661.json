Alex Reynolds from La \nTrobe University and Kristy-Lee Tyrell from RMIT worked as interns on the project during the recruitment \nstage and used both their professional and personal expertise to make the project a success. They \nalso joined the project reference group which guided the development of the questionnaire and the \nrecruitment process. We thank all the members of this group – Sue Hackney from The Way Out Project, \nJen Sainsbury from the Foundation for Young Australians, Roz Ward from The Rainbow Network, and \nFelicity Johns from the youth program at Doutta Gala Community Health Service – for their commitment \nto this research. \nWe also thank Hayley Conrad, Angela Bell and Andrea Chester for specific advice on promotion and \npublicity. Carolyn Whyte, a student on placement from RMIT, made a substantial contribution to analysing \nthe qualitative data and assisting with the production of the report, and continued this work beyond the \ntime of the placement.\nWe particularly thank Sunil Patel from Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria (GLHV) for the design and art \nwork supporting the promotion of the project and the report, and Liam Leonard, also from GLHV, for his \nparticular advice on the conduct of the research.\nThe research would not have been possible without the support of youth workers and volunteers all over \nAustralia promoting the survey by putting it into both professional and personal email networks, placing \nadvertisements on websites and including items in newsletters. These networks were the basis of the \nhigh number of participants this time and we owe them a real debt of gratitude.\nWe thank the gay press in all states and territories who not only gave us favourable advertising rates, but \nalso included stories of the research. JOY Melbourne promoted the research extensively on the radio and \nmany other gay media outlets also included material on their websites.\nMarian Pitts, Roz Ward and Felicity Nottingham proofread this report and we appreciate their time and \ninterest. We thank Marian Pitts for encouragement and leadership.\nOur greatest vote of thanks is, as always, reserved for the three and a half thousand young people who \ntook the time to fill in the survey. Your willingness to share your lives with us, the hard and dark times, the \ngood and rewarding times, the hopes for the future and the wisdom that comes with survival is genuinely \nappreciated. Your generosity, resilience and commitment continues to inspire us and we could not do this \nwork without all of you. \nVI Writing Themselves in 3\nFigures \nFigure 1.

In 2010, a total of 3134 same sex attracted and gender questioning (SSAGQ) young people \nparticipated in Writing Themselves In 3 (WTi3), almost double the number in 2004 and more than four \ntimes that of 1998. The participants, who were aged between 14 and 21 years, came from all states and \nterritories of Australia, from remote (2%), rural (18%) and urban (67%) areas and from a range of culturally \nand linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. There were more young women (57%) than young men \n(41%) and a smaller group (3%) who were gender questioning (GQ).\nSexual feelings\nIn 2010, the complex interaction of sexual attraction, identity and behaviour was even more evident than \nin previous studies. Most young men were exclusively same sex attracted but half of the young women \nwere attracted to both sexes and less than one third exclusively to the same sex. More than a third of \nyoung people realized their sexual difference before puberty and there were few gender differences in \nage of first realization.\nMore young people felt positive about their same sex attraction than in 2004.  As in 2004, young people \nwho felt bad about their sexuality used homophobic beliefs to describe their reasons whereas those who \nfelt good used resistant, affirming explanations.\nSexual identity\nMost young men identified as gay/homosexual. Young women were more likely to identify as bisexual. \nYoung women chose a greater range of identity terms to describe their sexuality. \nSexual behaviours\nAs in 2004, the evidence from this survey indicates that SSAGQ young people are less likely to use a \ncondom, twice as likely to become pregnant and more likely to contract a sexually transmitted infection \n(STI) compared to their heterosexual peers. However, 28% of participants had never had sex, more than \nthe 23% in 2004. Young women were more likely to have had sex than the young men and young men \nwere more likely to have had exclusive same sex sexual encounters than young women. One fifth of \nyoung women, despite their same sex attractions, continued to have sex exclusively with the opposite \nsex.  These young people were more likely to be sexually active at an earlier age than other young people \nraising the importance of teaching inclusive and relevant sex education and the need for inclusive sexual \nhealth service provision. \nHow do people treat you?\nWe learned from the previous two national reports that SSAGQ young people suffer high levels of verbal \nand physical homophobic abuse in the community and particularly at school. In 2010 61% of young \npeople reported verbal abuse because of homophobia, 18% physical abuse and 26% ‘other’ forms of \nhomophobia. Young men and GQ young people reported more abuse than young women.\nThe most common place of abuse remained school with 80% of those who were abused naming school. \nThis continues the trend of increased levels of reported homophobic violence in schools (69% in 1998; \n74% in 2004) and may, in part, be the result of more SSAGQ young people being out and visible. Sport \nwas the place of least abuse but young men and GQ young people were over represented in this \npercentage.\nX Writing Themselves in 3\nLinks between abuse and negative health indicators\nThere were strong links between homophobic abuse and feeling unsafe, excessive drug use, self \nharm and suicide attempts. Young people who had been physically abused had worse mental health \nindicators than those who reported verbal abuse or no abuse. Drug use, which we surmise from their \nstories is often about  self medication, was higher in these young people than young people in general \nand young women were more likely to use drugs than young men.  For more than half of the participants, \nhomophobic abuse impacted negatively on aspects of their schooling, however, for 42%, homophobia \nhad no impact at all.\nInternet use\nThe internet was readily available to the young people in this study with 97% having access at home. \nYoung people used the internet to seek opportunities not available offline, that is, to connect with \nothers in a similar situation and to learn about being same sex attracted. Those who reported using the \ninternet to explore sexual identity were more likely to be male and attracted exclusively to the same sex.  \nBelonging to an internet site was generally a positive experience for these young people with 75% of \nthem feeling accepted there for who they were and feeling pride in their sexuality.  Activism was also an \nimportant part of internet use with around a third feeling it was a place where they could work for change \naround homophobia. Facebook was overwhelmingly the most popular site used by participants.\nDisclosure and support\nIn 2010, 97.5% of young people had disclosed their same sex attractions to at least one person, a \ncontinuing trend to openness from 1998 (82%) and 2004 (95%). This was largely successful with \nsupport from family, friends, internet and professionals being higher than in previous studies. In general, \nyoung men were more likely to disclose, and more likely to be supported compared to young women, \nparticularly by parents.\nAs in previous reports, friends, more than anyone, were the first confidantes for SSAGQ young people. \nFriends and peers on the internet were also an important avenue of disclosure and for many young \npeople the only avenue for at least a time. While young people with a religious background were almost \nas likely to be out to parents compared to the rest, they were less likely to be supported. Young people \nfrom CALD backgrounds were less likely to tell their parents and, if they did, less likely to get family \nsupport.  \nSupport as a buffer against negative health outcomes of \nhomophobia\nSupport of family, friends and, to a lesser extent, professionals was shown to lessen the destructive \nimpacts of homophobia. A significant contribution to the mental health of SSAGQ young people was \nmade by schools which had policies against homophobic abuse, with students at these schools being \ngenerally less likely to self harm. More significant was the finding that young people who reported their \nschool as having a supportive environment, were less likely to harm themselves or attempt suicide \ndemonstrating the importance of putting policy into practice.  \nSexuality Education and school experience\nWhile a quarter of young people attended a school where they knew there was policy-based protection \nfrom homophobia and discrimination, almost a half of participants attended a school with no social or \nstructural support features for sexual diversity. One in five attended a school that they felt was, in the \nWriting Themselves in 3 XI \nmain, supportive or very supportive of their sexuality. As many as 37% of young people described their \nschool as homophobic or very homophobic overall. \nSexuality Education was not provided at all to 10%  of participants, and when it was, only 15% found \nit useful. It was clear that quite conservative messages emphasizing heterosexual sex and danger are \nthe norm in most Australian schools with a far smaller number providing messages inclusive of SSAGQ \nyouth. This meant that the internet, generally less trusted by young people, was the most important \nsource of information. Young people were asked what they wanted from their school and the strongest \ntheme (appearing in 40% of responses) was that they wanted the Sexuality Education delivered by their \nschool to be changed so that it was more inclusive of same sex attraction and gender diversity. \nMultiple layers of influence\nReligion\nA number of young people in the study mentioned religion in their answers. These young people were \nmore likely than others to feel bad about their same sex attraction and less likely to feel good. They \nwere also more likely to have experienced social exclusion or had to tolerate homophobic language \nfrom friends and family and to feel less safe  at home. These young people received less support from \nparents, siblings and teachers when they disclosed their sexuality and they were more likely to report self \nharm and suicidal thoughts. However, it is also important to note that they reported more positive and \naffirming religious experiences than young people in previous reports. Some young people in 2010 were \nable to comfortably be gay and Christian without the usual tensions between these two ways of being. \nRurality\nThrough their stories, many young people expressed concern about living in rural and remote towns \ndue to the isolation, discrimination and lack of appropriate services and support. The rates of self harm \nfor urban young people were far lower than those in rural and remote areas. Young people living in rural \nand remote areas were less likely to feel safe at school, at social occasions and on the internet than their \nurban peers. Many young people aspired to leave their rural and regional homes to become the person \nthey wanted to be in an urban environment. \nGender questioning (GQ) young people\nIn this survey 3% of young people described their gender identity as other than male or female. These \nyoung people had quite complex understandings of their attractions, sophisticated ideas on sexuality \nand different views on what various identities mean. Generally this group was more likely to have always \nknown their sexual identity and, while they were more likely to have disclosed their difference to others, \nthey were less likely to be supported. Gender Questioning (GQ) young people were also at greater risk of \nhomelessness, physical abuse, self harm and suicide. They were more likely to have moved schools or \ndropped out of school as a result of homophobia and to have had problems at school such as difficulty \nconcentrating, reduced academic performance and hiding at recess and lunchtime.\nMany of  these young people aspired to make a difference in the world despite the extra difficulties they \nface, and feel pride in their diversity. This group was twice as likely to get involved in activism in response \nto the discrimination they face.\nXII Writing Themselves in 3\nConclusion\nIt has been a privilege doing research with same sex attracted young people over the  last twelve years, \nand in that time we have seen many changes, most of which are positive ones, occurring in the worlds \nof these young people. One of the largest changes is in their visibility and in the expanding numbers we \nhave been able to access each time. \nThe most encouraging of all our findings is the degree to which, over the twelve years, supports for young \npeople have improved, despite increases in homophobic abuse. This is largely due to the efforts of the \nyoung people themselves in coming out and working for change, but also to the many advocates for \ntheir cause creating change, and to a progressive shift in social attitudes towards a more relaxed and \nappreciative view of sexual and gender diversity. \nRecommendations\nThe report concludes with a series of recommendations arising out of the research and directed at \ngovernment, education authorities, schools and health services.\nWriting Themselves in 3 1 \n1. Introduction\nOk :) Well this survey was like totally rad dude. (I dont really talk like that, Im just really into Bill and Teds \nExcellent Adventure lately) lol. And uh, I dunno, my life has been ok, I guess it could have been a lot worse. \nIts still just as boring and meaningless and insignificant as everyone elses. But maybe one day, perhaps \nthis year when I start uni, I’ll like make friends and like feel like I belong or some crap like that and yeah \nmaybe like oh no is he going to say it! yeah... find a boyfriend. Those are my main hopes for the future \nregarding any types of relationships with other people. I hope it works out. Thank you survey for being \nmy cybernetic friend for the evening lol :) You probably think im a total weirdo. thanks anyway :) (Luke, 17 \nyears)\nIt is with great pleasure that we present Writing Themselves In 3 (WTi3), the third national study of the \nsexual health and wellbeing of same sex attracted and gender questioning young people (SSAGQ)1. \nOver the last twelve years, as part of the Commonwealth funded program at the Australian Research \nCentre in Sex Health and Society (ARCSHS) (and Vic Health funded for WTi3), three Writing Themselves \nIn national studies have been conducted six years apart, the first in 1998, the second in 2004 and now \nWTi3 in 2010. The research was originally part of a national program of research with marginalised young \npeople, including rural and homeless youth. It aimed to document the sexual health and wellbeing of \nsame sex attracted young people because, in 1997, we knew little about how these young people were \nfaring, despite having strong anecdotal evidence of discrimination and homophobia in schools and the \ncommunity and negative health impacts. The national study in 1998 appears to have been a world first. \nThe Netherlands has just completed its first national study of same sex attracted young people this year \n(Keuzenkamp et al., 2010). \nThe 1998 report was used to inform a range of initiatives, including funding applications, curriculum \nmaterials, health promotion resources and social support groups and much was done nationally to train \nservice providers, including teachers. The 2004 report aimed to document changes over the previous \nsix years, especially given the work that had been done in schools and the community to counteract \nhomophobia. It also aimed to provide reliable information for workers with young people and policy \nmakers to use as a guide to practice. It recommended that government needed to show leadership \nin combating homophobia, especially in schools. There was much Government interest in this report. \nIn Victoria, for example, three pre-launch briefings were requested by government departments and a \nwhole of government round table was convened to plan a response to the problems highlighted by the \nresearch. \nThe Writing Themselves In reports serve several functions beyond being a strong indicator of the \nsexual health and wellbeing of SSAGQ young people. They are an indicator of levels of homophobia in \nAustralian schools and other places where young people congregate, and they reveal the effectiveness \nof the many interventions that aim to make Australia a safer and more inclusive place for these young \npeople. The Writing Themselves In reports also serve as a guide for government, other sectors and \nworkers who have responsibility for, and work, with  young people. The research has been widely \naccepted. It has been used Australia-wide to inform government policy, and is evident in a number of \ngovernment documents relating to social policy, school safety and curriculum development. The research \n1\t \tWe\thave\textended\tthe\tSSA\tacronym\tto\tinclude\tgender\tquestioning\t(GQ).\tThis\tincludes\tyoung\tpeople\twho\tidentify\tas\ttransgender,\tgender\tqueer\tand\t\n‘other’\tthan\tmale\tand\tfemale.\tWe\tfeel\tthat\tgender\tquestioning\tis\tsimilar\tto\tsame\tsex\tattracted\tin\tthat\tit\tspeaks\tfor\tthe\tpresent\tand\tnot\tthe\tfuture\tbut\t\nhonours\tyoung\tpeople’s\tfeelings\tand\tbeliefs\tat\tthe\tcurrent\ttime.\t\n2 Writing Themselves in 3\nhas also been used to produce resources in which the participant’s wisdom can be passed on to other \nyoung people, for example, the POSH booklets2.\nIn 2010, much has changed since the first Writing Themselves In report in 1998. The shifts have been \nin the direction of equity, visibility and support for sexual difference. The increased development of a \nhuman rights agenda relating to sexual health (Gruskin, 2006; WHO, 2006) has meant that same sex \nattracted young people are now regarded as having the right to good health and wellbeing, including \nup to date sexual health information and the right to an education free from discrimination and abuse.  \nWhile various relationships bills were sporadically introduced in most Australian states by 2004, the \nSame sex Relationships Equal Treatment General Law Reform Bill passed through the Australian Senate \nin 2008, reforming 58 federal laws to promote equity for same sex couples. Visibility in the media now \nnormalises same sex attraction and no longer do we have the tragic lesbian or gay male character \ninevitably dying at the end of a movie. There has been an increase in positive media visibility of alternate \nsexualities (for example, The L Word, True Blood, Glee, The Block, Modern Family and Ellen), and also \nin Australian television shows specifically (for example, openly gay contestants on Australian Master \nChef, same sex kisses on Neighbours and Home and Away and Aurora’s Australian Queer TV program \non Foxtel). However, at the time of print, the same sex marriage debate continues and there have been \nvarious protests around Australia on the issue. \nCommunity development projects have also highlighted SSAGQ youth issues and built capacity to \nsupport these young people within the community. Furthermore, many social support groups have given \nyoung people a safe space to find information and meet others like themselves. This is increasingly true \nfor gender diverse young people, for whom more information and online groups are becoming available. \nMost political parties now support antidiscrimination policies relevant to sexual orientation. It might then \nbe assumed that SSAGQ young people now live in safe, inclusive environments at school, at home and \nin the community.  This research with 3134 young people clearly demonstrates that this is not the case, \nand understandably so. Homophobia is an edifice that has taken many centuries to construct. It has \nbeen the brainchild of the most powerful institutions - the law, medicine, psychiatry and psychology and \norganised religion. While most of these institutions have recanted, including many parts of the Christian \nchurch, we should never assume that we can remove lingering homophobic beliefs entirely in a decade. \nHowever, in this report we can see that there are positive changes for these young people and we are \nslowly moving forward despite having a long way to go.\nThe survey\nThough we have maintained core questions in all of the Writing Themselves In surveys, there are always \nchanges and additions that relate to the changing context of SSAGQ young people’s lives. For example \nwe decided that though we could not ask about self harm and suicide in 1998, this time there are now \nenough supports around for us to do that. The questions about drug use have changed as drug cultures \nchange, and we have included more items about the increasingly important areas of the internet and \nschool policies in this report. This time the research team has been expanded to include a number of \nyoung researchers who bring a unique perspective to the work and may carry it on in the future.  They \nhave been involved in planning, executing and writing this report.\n2\t \tThe\tPOSH\tbooklet\tis\tabout\tthe\tways\tyoung\tpeople\thave\treframed\tnegative\tbeliefs\tabout\tsame\tsex\tattraction\tas\tpositive\tones.\t16000\tcopies,\tin\t5\treprints\t\nhave\tbeen\tdistributed\tAustralia\twide.\tIt\tcan\tbe\tdownloaded\tfrom\twww.latrobe/edu.au/ssay\nWriting Themselves in 3 3 \nWe have introduced a new term, ‘gender questioning’ (GQ) into this report to describe young people who \ndo not identify themselves as being male or female, rather they identify as transgender, gender queer or \nother. We have labelled this group of around 90 young people ‘gender questioning’ because they have \nquestioned or are questioning their gender or in some cases they question traditional gender structures. \nThe term is in keeping with the recent policy blueprint Beyond Homophobia: Meeting the needs of SSAGQ \nyoung people in Victoria (Leonard et al., 2010) which used the term for the first time. We have discovered \nin this third national report that findings about these young people often vary considerably from those \nwho identify as male and female. Because they are small in numbers, we have created a special section \nfor them in the report (see Chapter 13) where all the findings can be seen together for a clearer picture of \nwhat is happening in their lives. \nNumbers of participants in The Writing Themselves In surveys have grown dramatically from 749 in \n1998, to 1749 in 2004 to 3134 in 2010. We surmise that this increase in numbers is in part because \nthese young people are more likely to be ‘out’ in 2010, encouraged by greater visibility of gay people \nand because there are more supports. As well, networks of those working with these young people have \ngrown dramatically and the internet and social networking sites have made it easier to recruit participants. \nFinally, same sex attraction is no longer a taboo topic, it is discussed widely and in many schools and \ncommunities it is regarded as a legitimate component of the vast tapestry of human sexuality.\nThis report, as the others before it, acts as a report card for governments, communities, families and in \nparticular, schools. We learn who chooses to include or neglect, who chooses to abuse or support and \nwhat this means for the mental health and wellbeing of these young people. We have the numbers in \nthis study to provide strong statistical evidence and we have young people’s stories which provide vivid \nexplanations for any findings that emerge. Our hope is that those working with SSAGQ youth will take the \nresearch report and use it to champion change as they did in 1998 and 2004.  \n4 Writing Themselves in 3\nWriting Themselves in 3 5 \n2. Design of the study\n… just doing this survey made me cry so many times throughout it. Its nice to know that something is \nfinally being done so future people dont have to go through the fear and abuse that I had to go through…\n(Mike, 20 years)\n…thanks hey this has made me think a lot, i didnt expect to become aware of these feelings and cry in a \nsurvey ( my job is to do surveys) i think this shows perhaps how few avenues, just socially exist for this kind \nof discussion, i feel like i lost something along the way where i used to when i was young think on these \nthings and i know it is something i still need to think about. thanks hey. (Becky, 18 years)\nThe world in which today’s same sex attracted and gender questioning (SSAGQ) young Australians are \nliving is in many ways different from the one in which the survey was first conducted in 1998. Differences \ninclude how young people communicate through new media technologies, changing attitudes \nto homosexuality and changes in the law to protect same sex relationships.  To ensure that these \ndifferences were reflected in the survey and that the  project was sensitive to contemporary youth issues, \nwe formed a small informal reference group of researchers from the Australian Research Centre in Sex, \nHealth and Society (ARCSHS) as well as representatives from workers with youth and same sex attracted \nyoung people. \nQuestionnaire design and development\nAs in the previous two national surveys, an online questionnaire was used to collect the data. This \nquestionnaire contained both forced-choice (quantitative) and open-ended qualitative questions.\nThe WTi3 survey used the format and design of the 1998 and 2004 questionnaires as templates with \nsubtitled themed sections and an optional open-ended Final Request - where the participants could relay \ntheir personal stories. WTi3 also provided the option as in 1998 and 2004 of completing the survey in \nhard copy or online, although no young person requested a hard copy. For the first time, the new survey \nwas hosted by the collaborative online organisation Demographix which allowed us to construct the \nsurvey and data collection system through a hosted interface, have a URL that was separate from our \nusual university-based SSAY page (the survey’s web address was www.wti3.org.au), and use additional \nstructural features. Typical completion time was 20 minutes, although many took longer to write extensive \nstories.\nTerminology regarding sexuality\nThe content of the 1998 survey was used as the basis for the new version (see Appendix 1).  Changes \nhad been made to this template in 2004, when questions were added on such topics as self harm, \npregnancy and the impact of homophobia and discrimination. In 2004, we were also particularly \ninterested in whether young people were accessing the extra supports and services that have been made \navailable since the 1998 survey, and wanted to allow participants to talk about the activism they were \ninvolved in. However, for WTi3 we had some new and expanded areas of interest.\nThe first addition was a section on internet use, exploring its impact on the experiences of same sex \nattraction, identity, community, communication, youth activism and support. The second addition is an \nexpanded section on schools and Sexuality Education. Here we allowed the young people to reflect on \nhow useful schooling was and what else they wanted from it in the future. The Writing Themselves In \nreports have successfully called for education policy documents - such as Victoria’s Supporting Sexual \nDiversity in School (DEECD, 2008) - schooling materials and teacher training programmes.  Part of this \n6 Writing Themselves in 3\nnew section specifically explores what impact such policy developments are having, and where more \nattention is needed. \nThe third important set of changes is best described as an opening up of gender structures to include \nmore categories for gender and using the term parents rather than mother and father in the section \nabout country of birth. The fourth change affected drug use. Here, we expanded the range of drugs listed \nthat young people may have used, and offered a variety of synonyms and street terms for the drugs \nmentioned. The fifth and last notable change to the survey’s content affected the section on disclosure \nAbout Your Family and Friends. Where previously this question only asked if the participants had told \na particular type of family or friend, this time we included an additional component to the question \nregarding how the person reacted to this disclosure. \nThe WTi3 questionnaire was divided into ten subject categories which contained closed and open-ended \nitems (see Appendix 1) and a final request for young people to tell more of the story of their experiences. \nThe questionnaire was piloted with young people and youth workers in urban and rural areas during \nNovember 2009 and was officially live on December 14th, 2009 at 5pm.\nEthical considerations\nEthical approval was obtained for this project from the La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee. Of \nparticular importance was that these young people were not required to obtain their parents’ approval to \ntake part in the study.\nA combination of literature reviews, reference group meetings and piloting processes were utilised to \nensure that the WTi3 questionnaire was appropriate for participants aged 14-21.  Its design considers the \nparticipants’ vulnerability and capacity to consent to participation, and ensures they are given information \nabout the research and its effects at their level of comprehension on the consent page. Competence to \ngive consent was in part determined by the young person’s selection of the age option. Where an age \noption below the accepted range of 14-21 was selected, the person was denied access to the online \nsurvey by the provider. However, where an otherwise unsuitable or incompetent person participated in the \nsurvey as detected in analysis of the data, their responses were not included in the final data set. \nSampling\nThe target group – same sex attracted young men and women in Australia between the ages of 14 \nand 21 – was the same as for the original studies. Young people needed to self select to be part of the \nresearch. We endeavoured to include young people from all states and territories of Australia, from rural \nand urban areas and a range of CALD backgrounds.  \nDesign of recruitment campaign concept \nThe Who pushes your buttons? concept slogan was chosen as most suitable by young people and the \nreference group from a range of options. It offered a variety of relevant meanings for a survey questioning \nyouth about sexual attraction as well as what annoys them in terms of experiences of discrimination, who \nsupports them and who does not. It also connected to and modernised previous slogans – the 1998 \nreport campaign’s Who turns you on? and the 2004 report campaign’s Who stops you in your tracks? \nA logo was also produced in the form of a heart shaped rainbow button signifying same sex attraction \nand sexual diversity themes. The heart shape was playful and apt for a survey dealing with attraction and \nyoung love. \nWriting Themselves in 3 7 \nWTi3 Rainbow Heart Button Logo\nRecruitment and promotion\nActive recruitment commenced in December 2009, and continued until the end of May 2010. We used \nnumerous media formats: business cards, print media, social networking sites and group websites, radio \netc.\n• Business Cards \nBusiness cards were designed for distribution by volunteers and community group organisers at events \nand workshops related to GLBTIQ community gatherings such as Sydney’s Mardi Gras and Fair Day, \nMelbourne’s Midsumma and Pride March. The enthusiasm of a number of contacts and networks \ngreatly helped the project along, with a number of service and youth workers in all states and territories \ndistributing the cards to young people. \n     \nBusiness Card Design\n• Print Media\nPress releases were sent out to key print media around Australia, including the gay press. This resulted in \na number of articles and interviews which further enhanced the reach of the survey.\n8 Writing Themselves in 3\n• Internet\nSince previous surveys, the internet and online social networking has continued to develop and become \nintegrated into the daily practices of most young people (Boyd & Ellison, 2008). Not only are same sex \nattracted young people continuing to go online but many SSAY services/support groups now have their \nown  stand alone Internet site and/or Facebook or MySpace groups (for example see www.opendoors.\nnet.au). It was therefore important that recruitment targeted online established contacts and developed \nnew online contacts to increase the potential reach of the survey. The researchers created two one page \ndocuments suitable for email dissemination and sent them to email contacts. These documents were \nthen widely disseminated throughout Australia and resulted in a number of links on web pages used by \nyoung people. \nScreen Shot of Wti3 Feature Article on Open Doors Website\n• Social Networking Sites\nDue to the recent proliferation of youth memberships and activity on social networking sites, we \npaid special attention to Facebook, MySpace and Twitter. The largest of these during the recruitment \nperiod was Facebook, and this guided our decision to run a paid advertisement campaign on the site \nintermittently throughout our recruitment period.  Facebook allowed us to advertise only to our target \ngroup.  We also created a Twitter page and a MySpace page to promote the survey through unpaid social \nnetworking avenues.\n• Radio\nAll community radio stations were sent out an information sheet offering interviews pre and post research. \nWhile there was not a huge response to this from participants we are committed to using community \nradio to inform the community more broadly about the research.\nData analysis\nData were downloaded from Demographix and then transposed into quantitative (SPSS v10) and \nqualitative (Excel) computer programs. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were undertaken. \nAll significant differences in the report are calculated at .05, however, to ensure the accessibility of the \nreport, specific statistical results are not presented here. Qualitative data were read and analysed in \nthe light of the quantitative results as well as in their own right with themes produced, interrogated and \nunderstandings presented. Young people’s stories have been presented throughout the report.\nWriting Themselves in 3 9 \nComparisons have been made with three studies: the 1998 and 2004 Writing Themselves In studies \n(Hillier et al., 1998; Hillier et al., 2005) and the 2008 secondary students and sexual health survey \n(SSASH) (Smith et al., 2009). Within the study we focussed on differences according to gender, age, \ncultural and linguistic background and location. We also focussed on differences in health outcomes \naccording to abuse status.\nIm actually really glad i did this survey, because it feels nice to be able to let some of this out :) (Amanda, \n17 years)\n… thanks for letting me get this off my chest, i havent been able to find many people i can just be open \nwith yet, and its almost sad that i have to resort to an online anonymous survey. thanks again (Jacob, 18 \nyears)\n10 Writing Themselves in 3\nWriting Themselves in 3 11 \n3. The young people\ni love my life i have great relationships with friends and my family i have had a couple of relationships in the \npast years but at the moment… im more focusing on school and being a teen maybe later in life. when \ni have the time for one but at the moment im happy without one im an average teen dealing with most \naverage teen problems i dont believe in labels so i dont call myself anything really i think guys are really hot \nand wouldnt mind dating them but im fine with being more of a teen XT (Travis, 17 years)\nI hope in future, I’ll find a beautiful woman to share the rest of my life with,\nand when the time comes, we can marry with ALL my family there \nand start a family of our own and our family can live in safety and in happiness.\nIf my child is straight, okay, if my child is homosexual, okay! If my child is gender queer, okay! I love my life \nright now, it’s just a matter of ignoring the dreadful things said.\nThat’s about it. Thanks for the opportunity! (Billy, 16 years)\nKey Findings\n• 3134 SSAGQ young people participated in Writing Themselves In 3, almost double that of 2004 \nand more than four times 1998.\n• There were more young women (57%) than young men (41%) and a smaller group (3%), who \nwere gender questioning (GQ).\n• The average age of participants was 17 years.\n• Almost one in five young people came from a culturally and linguistically diverse background.\n• One fifth of young people came from rural and remote areas.\n• The internet was the most successful recruitment strategy, with three quarters of young people \nhearing about the survey through this medium.\nOver 3400 people responded to this third national survey (WTi3) of same sex attracted and gender \nquestioning young people (SSAGQ) through the website URL www.wti3.org.au. Hard copies were \navailable, however, no young person requested one. Those who did not fit the criteria of age (14-\n21), location (reside in Australia) and sexuality/gender (same sex attracted or gender questioning), \nwere removed from the study. This left us with 3134 valid participants, almost double that of the 2004 \nstudy and four times the original number in the 1998 study. This gratifying increase in numbers can \nbe explained in part by increased networks, increased visibility in Australian culture and the internet, \nparticularly social networking sites.\n12 Writing Themselves in 3\nWhere did you first hear about the survey?\nI hope my contribution is helpful. I had heard of this survey before, however this is the first time I’ve actually \ndone it. I’ll be sure to let my friends know of its existence xx  (Mark, 16 years).\nThis core question has been used as a guide to recruitment in this and previous surveys. It may also \nbe useful for others carrying out research with this population. In order to ascertain the success of the \nvarious advertising strategies (mentioned previously in the methods chapter) we asked the young people \nWhere did you first hear about this survey?  From Figure 1 below, we can see that the internet was the \nmost successful recruitment strategy with 75% of young people (61% in the 2004 study) hearing about \nthe study online.  SSAGQ youth related contacts alerted 8% of young people to the survey and this \nincluded youth workers and SSAGQ youth specific groups. Peers and friends (8%) were also important in \ninforming young people about the survey. \nFigure 1.  How did you first hear about the survey?\nRadio\n0%\nThe Internet\n75%\nMagazine\n1%\nSexual diversity group\n5%\nYouth worker\n2%\nPeer-group/friends\n8%\nOther\n9%\nIn terms of differences between groups, GQ young people were more likely to hear about the survey \nthrough SSAGQ youth groups and youth workers (24%) compared with 7% of other young people in \nthe research. Despite the internet’s growing success in advertising this survey, we continue to use other \ncommunity avenues such as networks, radio and magazines because they are vital dissemination points \nfor alerting other members of the community to the research.\nGender\nThis question was revised from previous studies in line with changing cultures in young people. As well \nas asking about male, female and transgender male to female and female to male (m-f and f-m) we \nalso included gender queer and other.  Because of smaller numbers and the similarities in findings, \nyoung people who were transgender, gender queer and other were included  under the category gender \nquestioning (GQ). This is in acknowledgement that all of these young people have questioned their \nRadio\n0%\nThe Internet\n75%\nMagazine\n1%\nSexual diversity group\n5%\nYouth worker\n2%\nPeer-group/friends\n8%\nOther\n9%\nWriting Themselves in 3 13 \ngender in the past or continue to question it now. As well, many question the very structures by which the \nnotion of gender is upheld.\nIn terms of gender, more young women (57%, n=1766) filled out the questionnaire than young men \n(41%, n=1265). This is in contrast to the 2004 study in which there were more young men. This may be \ndue to the rise of social networking and the closing down of Mogenic in 2005, a website used mainly by \nyoung men, however we cannot be sure. In the gender category, GQ, there were 0.6% (n=18) trans m-f, \n0.7% (n=21) trans f-m, 1.4% (n=43) gender queer and 0.3% (n=9) other.  The importance of the other \ncategory is encapsulated in Ashley’s comments:\nNot really sure yet, physically female but not sure mentally. I feel most comfortable in guys’ clothes and \nwhen I am treated like a guy but I still wouldn’t define myself as transgender, not yet anyway (Ashley, 17 \nyears).\nWe will report some of the findings for the GQ group in the body of this report, however, because the \nnumbers are relatively small and the findings quite different from the rest of the study sample, a special \nsection in Chapter 13  will provide an important summary of the findings for this group.\nAge\nYoung people ranged in age from 14-21 years with an average age of 17 years, a year younger than \nprevious studies. This may be a reflection of the trend towards young people coming out earlier than \nbefore. There were no gender or culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) differences in average age.\nCountry of birth\nNinety per cent of the young people in the survey were born in Australia with another 4% born in NZ, UK, \nUSA and Canada. Two percent were born in Southern and Eastern Europe, 2% in South-East Asia with \nthe remaining born in North and Southern Africa, Middle East, Central Asia and the Americas.\nTwenty-three countries were mentioned as being the birth country of the young person or either of his/\nher parents. Of these, 14 were classified as CALD, mainly because English was not the first language. On \nthis basis 18% (n=557) were classified as having a CALD background. As well 3% (n=97) of the young \npeople were of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) descent. This number is representative of \nthe numbers of ATSI young people in the general youth population (Australian Institute of Health and \nWellbeing, 2007).\nRemoteness of young people’s residence\nOnce again it was pleasing to see that this survey attracted a sample of rural and remote young people. \nThe Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Areas Classification (RRMA) was used to divide young people into \ncategories of remoteness. This classification divides Australian states and territories into metropolitan \n(1&2), rural (1, 2 & 3) and remote (1&2) zones. M1 covers capital cities, M2 metropolitan centres, R3 \nlarge rural centres, R4 small rural centres, R5 other rural centres, Rem6 centres >5000 and Rem7 other \nremote centres (AIHW, 2009).\n14 Writing Themselves in 3\nAccording to the RRMA index, 67% (n=1975) of young people lived in  metropolitan zones (including \nmajor cities), 18%  (n=662) lived in rural zones and 2% (n=49) were from remote zones. This represents \na slight increase in the number of participants from rural zones compared to the 2004 survey.\nState or territory of residence \nEvery effort was made to recruit young people from each state and territory in proportion to young \npeople within the general population of each state and territory of Australia. Most young people came \nfrom Victoria (31%, n=946), New South Wales (27%, n=809), and Queensland (19%, n=586), with \nlower numbers coming from Western Australia  (10)%, n=305), SA (7%, n=215), Tasmania (3%, n=77), \nAustralian Capital Territory (3%, n=80) and Northern Territory (0.5%, n=15).  \nFigure 2. State/territory of residence: general youth population and survey sample\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nNSW VIC QLD SA WA TAS NT ACT\nSurvey data (n = 3033)\n2006 Census Data Population 14-21\n(n = 2,175,423)\nAccommodation\nYoung people were asked about their living arrangements and most young people (71%) were living in \nthe family home. A small proportion (4%) lived with relatives and the remainder were living in a shared \nhouse or flat (12%), on their own (4%), in a boyfriend/girlfriend’s house (4%), in a boarding house (2%), \nwith a small number living in squats, refuges, streets or caravans (2%). GQ young people were less likely \nto be living at home (51% v 71%) and more likely to be living with relatives (9% v 4%) or in a shared house \n(19% v 11%). There were no differences in accommodation arrangements on the basis of religion and \nethnicity.\nWriting Themselves in 3 15 \nEducation and work status\nYoung people were asked what they were doing now and they could tick as many boxes as applied from \na list including school, uni/TAFE, working full or part time and unemployed.  Forty one percent of young \npeople attended school, and 40% were enrolled in university or TAFE. The number of young people \nworking full time (11%) and part time (30%) was similar to the last survey, as was the number of young \npeople who were unemployed (5%).   \nType of secondary school attended\nWe added a new item in regards to school as a prelude to your secondary school experience which \nasked young people to indicate the type of school they attended. Most young people attended \nGovernment schools (65%), Catholic (18%) and other Christian (12%) schools. A smaller number \nof participants attended Islamic (0.2%), Jewish (0.5%), Steiner (0.4%), and other private education \nsystems (4%).  There were SSAGQ young people at ballet schools, Scientology-run schools and distance \neducation programs.\nReligion\nAs in 2004, there were no questions in the survey in 2010 about religion, however, many young \npeople mentioned religious discourse and how it was used against them in abusive ways. We used \nthe qualitative data in the survey to find mention of religious discourse and we compared those who \nmentioned religion to those who didn’t. Four percent of young people mentioned religion. Throughout \nthe report these young people will be referred to as the religious group, however, this does not mean \nthat they were religious or that they came from a religious background although many did.  It also is \nnot meant to imply that those who did not mention religion are not religious. Differences between these \ngroups will be noted in the report where they exist with a summary section on Religion at the end of the \nreport in Chapter 13.\n16 Writing Themselves in 3\nRonan’s story, 20 years\nIt’s not easy. Not at all. No one wants to be different. Sometimes they just are. I guess I have pretty \nmuch always been a bit queer. I liked wearing all the women’s clothes in dress ups at preschool and \nkindergarten and in role playing games I was always female. I don’t know why. I was different: I didn’t like \nsport, I liked to read and was good academically. I’ve never had many male friends; the ones that mattered \nwere always female. I think I’ve always been a bit effeminate. Not that all gay people are like that but I was \nand always felt different.\nHigh school was different. I had a few purely plutonic crushes on girls and would go home and masturbate \nover other guys. I didn’t think there was anything wrong with that until about grade eight when I had my first \ncrush on a boy. He was one of my few male friends. I had seen him with his shirt off during swimming and \nwas attracted immediately. Gradually I realised other guys didn’t feel this way and that I was different even \nmore so than I thought.\n  \nI told some friends of my crush and they were shocked but supportive. I was kind of a novelty for a while. \nBut mothers started talking as my friends had told their mums so speculation between them and parents of \npeople I hadn’t told started flying around. I got scared and told my mum I had shared my secret. She was \nangry and embarrassed. I had come out to mum in grade eight and nine. I tried to like girls in between and \nto find them interesting sexually. It didn’t work but I did end up telling people I liked a girl and the rumours \nceased till I left town. My senior years were spent in a school I barely knew with people I generally didn’t \nlike, except for a few close friends. I didn’t tell anyone at this school until we were finished year 12 and on \nto uni. As I got older I became more comfortable with my sexuality and in 2009 I came out to most of my \nclosest friends. My mum doesn’t like it but she doesn’t argue about it like she used to.  \nI’ve never had a boyfriend, never been kissed by either sex, never been touched or held hands with \nanyone. Completely a virgin. I now feel ready to change that and have become more and more \ncomfortable with telling strangers, buying gay books, movies, CDs, magazines and other stuff in public, \nand most of my current friends are completely comfortable with me, though they are still mostly female. I \ndon’t know what the future holds. I’m still a second class citizen, a vehemently hated minority, and don’t \nknow whether any of it will really change.  \nI worry sometimes that I won’t ever find someone to share life with, because the gay community, \nparticularly the men, are mostly only interested in sex and drugs. I want something more, but sometimes, \nwhen I look at gay media, I wonder if it even exists.  \nI think that if gay people want respect, they need to start acting like they deserve it. No one respects \npromiscuity, drug use and public sex. The community needs to clean up its act if it wants any chance if \nachieving equality. \nWriting Themselves in 3 17 \n4. Sexual feelings\nI would like to experience both lesbian and male interactions, sexually and emotionally. I always liked girls \nas well as guys but never really thought much of it, until about a year ago, I realised I liked girls a lot, more \nthan my friends did, and wanted to kiss them. Yet i still want to be in a relationship with a guy. If I was to be \ninvolved with a girl, sexually, I would have to like her as a friend, the same as a guy, before i had intercourse \nwith her. (Caroline, 16 years)\nKey findings\n•  More than four out of five young men were exclusively attracted to the same sex whereas more \nthan half of the young women were attracted to both sexes.\n•  Young people felt better about their sexual feelings than in 2004 or 1998.\n•  Young people continue to find new and affirming ways to understand their sexual difference.\n•  More than a third of young people realized their sexual difference before puberty.\nSexual attraction\nFigure 3. Comparison of gender and sexual attraction in 2010\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nOwn sex only Both sexes Opposite sex only Unsure\nMale (n =1261)\nFemale (n = 1757)\nGQ (n = 90)\nAs in previous studies, we asked young people whether they were attracted to people of the same sex \nonly, both sexes, the opposite sex only or if they were unsure. From Figure 3 below it can be seen that \n84% of young men were attracted only to men while 54% of young women were attracted to both sexes. \nThese differences in attraction between young men and young women continue from previous reports. \nThe GQ group had a more complex understanding of sexual attraction which is examined in the separate \nsection at the end of the report. \n18 Writing Themselves in 3\nHow do you feel about being attracted to the same sex?\nIn the previous studies and this one, we asked young people how they felt about being attracted to \npeople of their own sex. The 2010 data reveal that young people felt more positive about their sexual \nfeelings (see Figure 4) than in 2004, with 79% of young people feeling good about their same sex \nattraction. In addition, fewer young people reported feeling bad (4% in 2010, 5% in 2004, 10% in 1998). \nThese trends reflect the more positive visibility of same sex attraction in Australian culture generally \nover time in the media, legislation and community. There was little differentiation across gender or age, \nhowever the religious group as a whole felt worse about their sexual feelings than their non-religious \npeers.\nA core item, was to ask young people to explain how they felt because these explanations give us insight \ninto the discourses that are being used to produce their positive and negative feelings. We learned from \nthe 2004 study that how young people feel about their sexuality is significantly related to self harm and \nthis remained the case in 2010.  Some reported always feeling great about their sexuality, particularly \nthose who had a supportive family or positive relationships with friends. Those young people who wrote \nabout feeling good often included anecdotes of gaining increased support over time, questioning \nthe intellectual and general calibre of those delivering negative comments towards them, locating the \nproblem of homophobia within society rather than in homosexuality itself, becoming more clear about \ntheir sexuality through experiences of sexual discovery, feeling increased confidence and having positive \nhopes for their future.\nFigure 4. How do you feel about being attracted to the same sex: 1998, 2004, 2010\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nGood Okay Bad\n1998 (n = 749)\n2004 (n = 1748)\n2010 (n = 3117)\nWriting Themselves in 3 19 \nExamining the two extremes in feeling good and bad revealed that if young people in this research felt \ngood, it was usually because they had been able to reframe ways of thinking about their sexuality. Those \nwho felt bad seemed not to have access to affirmative discourses. For example, Matthew felt really bad \nabout his sexual feelings in response to social discourses and being bullied at school:\nI feel pathetic, and wrong, based entirely around society. If gay people weren’t so victimised by modern \nday society, I’d feel a lot better. I’m not saying that acceptance of different sexualities hasn’t improved over \nthe past century, because it obviously has, but the most stressful time for bullying to occur would be during \na child’s schooling, and at the present this is where most of it seems to occur (Matthew, 17 years).\nAt the other end of the scale, David felt good about his sexual feelings after hearing people’s different \nperspectives on same sex attraction:\nAlthough I first felt attracted to people of my own sex when going through puberty, I didn’t accept these \nfeelings until much later at age 17 (9 months ago). Previously I had thought that one day I would become \nstraight like my 4 older siblings and parents who are all straight. I had been brought up to believe that \nsexuality is not an orientation but an action or behaviour. Having heard other people’s stories about coming \nto terms with their sexuality, I now believe the opposite. I am very accepting of who I am (David, 18 years).\nIn both of these cases, young people show that social and school cultures, and exposure to other \npeople’s ways of thinking, can affect how young people perceive and feel about their sexuality. However, \nwe learn from David, that there is always room for change. Young people often described a shift in their \nthinking from first realisations and feeling bad to later feeling good or great about their sexuality. This is \nimportant because it shows us that changes in a young person’s thinking and changes in community \nattitudes can make all the difference to a young person’s health and wellbeing. Education and exposure \nto new positive discourses are important for young people and their communities.\nI spent a large portion of my teenage years denying and attempting to change my sexuality. The shameful \npinnacle of this is probably a tie between praying to God every night for I’m not even sure how long, and \ntrying to use operant conditioning on myself to try to get excited over women and stop getting excited over \nmen. Of course, these attempts didn’t work as planned; though I did feel a swelling of pride in my heart \nthe one time I managed to get an erection from a woman. But I have grown to understand and accept my \nsexuality more, especially after revealing myself to my friends and family. I feel less anxious now, though \nthere is still a sense of isolation; and I sometimes feel very naked, as if I wasn’t really being “me” until my \nfriends and family all knew I was gay (it was almost as if I was playing a game in which I was a spy with a \nsecret nobody could know, and I had to act in very particular ways so they wouldn’t find out). I could keep \nmy distance from them, but now it can seem a little too real and it is frightening....I don’t really hate being \nhomosexual, it’s just sort of like... having a bad haircut, or wearing clothes that everyone points out for \nsome reason. You have to deal with it, and how you deal with it is what matters. (Tristan, 18 years)\n20 Writing Themselves in 3\nFirst realisations\nare you kidding? I think most gay kids always know. I was a creative, slightly strange kid. When everyone \nin grade 3 started to ‘date’... I thought it was strange that they liked girls. I thought I’d bloom later. Year 5 \nonwards, my physical attractions began to develop towards boys. There was no defining moment, but \nmany moments that made me realise... it took me until yr 10 to accept I was gay despite the obvious \nfeelings. Yr 11 and 12 I knew I’d have to come out one day... (Liam, 21 years).\nIn previous studies we sought information about when young people first realised they were same sex \nattracted through their final response. In this study a specific question was asked about when they first \nknew and what happened. Young people could select options of always knew, unsure, or a specific age. \nAs in 2004 we learned that 10% always knew, 26% knew by age 10, 60% knew by age 13 and 85% by age \n15. Five percent were unsure when they first realised their sexual difference (see Figure 5 below). \nThis finding has many ramifications for Sexuality Education and fair representation at school, particularly \nin the early years. It is important for education policy makers and sex educators to consider that more \nthan half of these young people will know they are same sex attracted at primary school, and may make \nup around 6% of the primary school population. In the past in Australia, there have been prohibitions on \ntalking about this subject with young children at school. Even the visibility of families with two mothers or \ntwo fathers in the media or in story books is likely to raise concerns about talking about sex with young \nchildren. It could be argued, however, that talking about family and giving fair representation is talking \nabout family, not about sex, regardless of whether the parents are heterosexual or homosexual.  \nFigure 5.

I was older when I \nrealised I was attracted to men too, and older still before I figured out that its queerness I’m attracted to \n(Casey, 20 years).\nI am actually not sure when or how I realised I was pansexual exactly. I had suspected I was bisexual since \nI was 12, however I felt that it wasn’t just males or females I was attracted to - I felt there must be a third \ngender, or even no gender, and that I would be attracted to these people too. It was when I read about \npansexuality that I realised that this is who I am (Rae, 17 years).\nThe one in ten who reported always knowing seemed to have less conflict about who they  were – it was \njust a part of them:\nI always knew. Since I was little it was just always something about myself that was as basic and \nunchangeable as the colour of my eyes (Melissa, 21 years)\nThey based their always knowing on a range of things including same sex attraction and gender \ndifference: \nLooked at girls differently to boys, was never a feminine girl, had crushes on female friends that kinda thing \n(Isabella, 21 years).\nSince I can remember I have always been different from other boys. At the age of 3 when they were playing \nwith Hotwheels, I wanted to play with Barbie. When watching Disney movies I always thought ‘when is my \nprince coming?’ (Brock, 14 years) \nA large portion of the young people directly or indirectly attributed their realisations to experiencing \ngeneral desire for people of a certain gender:\nSince childhood i felt attraction for both boys and girls, but gradually the feelings for girls went away. One \nday a new guy to my school walked in to class and i felt such an attraction that i simply knew. (Jordan, 17 \nyears)\n22 Writing Themselves in 3\nI just started noticing girls just as much as boys. It didn’t freak me out. I just accepted it. I think my mates \nmade more of a fuss than i did. (Emma, 17 years)\nFor others the object of desire was more specific:\ni had a crush on a couple guys at my old school. (Dylan, 15 years)\nI basically just got a crush on a girl in the year above me at school. Nothing ever happened but I remember \nbeing really scared and feeling disgusted with myself. (Hannah, 18 years)\nAt this age I find myself falling in love with people for who they are, with their gender not really having any \nsort of influence on the situation. (Grace, 16 years)\nOthers came to their sexuality through sexual exploration:\nI had been sexually active since eleven years old with other boys I knew. It was only at thirteen that I \nrealised this probably had some correlation with my sexual orientation. (Benjamin, 16 years)\nTo be honest I’m not sure if I fully understood it at the time. Maybe it’s more realistic to date it from age \n12 when I entered into my first homosexual relationship. However, at 9 a female friend and I used to \nplay a game, which involved playing the parts of each other’s boyfriends. We kissed and fooled around, \nhowever for me it didn’t seem so much like childish experimentation, as a comfort and an attraction and a \ncloseness and an intimacy that I hadn’t experienced before. (Holly, 20 years)\nSome young people said that when someone else was out or disclosed their sexuality it prompted their \nown realisations:\nTalking to some random from another country, she told me she was bisexual, and well I sort of realised the \nmore we talked about it. (Connor, 16 years)\nI used to go to a catholic school. Then met a new student in yr 9 and she was gay. Until then I never \nreally knew or thought about ‘that’ lifestyle. Since then my world was more opened up, I spose. However, \nlooking back, my first toy (that I remember, excluding soft toys such as teddy bears) were those action \nman figures. Never barbie shiz. First clothes were blue. Never wore dresses. I have played womens AFL \nand cricket since I was much younger. I’m not saying it’s the stereotypical things that point towards me \nrealising- I just point out some things that may have influenced my ways of thinking. The boy ‘crushes’ I’ve \nhad as a young teen....don’t compare with the feelings I have for women. With boys it was more ‘you’re \ngood looking, that’s it’ kinda thing. With women it’s more ‘I want to sleep or be in a relationship with you’, \nthat kinda thing. :) (Hayley, 18 years)\nThere were some who described a pivotal moment in their lives when realisation dawned on them:\nWriting Themselves in 3 23 \nAfter knowing her for a few years, I caught myself looking at her in a particular moment, thinking how utterly \nbeautiful her humanity was, and I got that funny feeling in my stomach. (Zoe, 20 years)\nSomeone actually asking me. (Nicholas, 15 years).\nDreams were a catalyst to realisation for other young people:\nDreams, read a comic that really helped me understand what was going on in my head. (Amber, 18 years)\nI was having sexual dreams about the same sex, and i dont mind. (Ruby, 21 years)\nI think I had a dream about a friend of mine. Then I started thinking about it, and things started clicking \ninto place. It’s sounds odd, but I was thinking about this obsession I had with Julia Roberts as a little girl. \nI loved all her movies, and would watch them again. When I was first thinking of possibly being unstraight, \nthat was one of the first things that came into my mind. It was just like “huh, that’s why”. (Jasmine, 16 \nyears) \nLooking at pornography prompted a realisation for some:\nWhen we got the internet I started looking at gay porn and realised then. (Harrison, 20 years)\nTo be frank, my preference in pornographic material. (Jayden, 21 years)\nThere were also discussions of how the realisation spanned a series of reflections:\nLots of gay youth, myself include, realise they had same sex attracted sexual feelings retrospectively. In \ngrade 5 I could say that my behaviour was certainly reflective of my sexuality, but wouldn’t have been able \nto realise it at the time. Attribution of my own sexuality for me was an ongoing, fluid process. While I could \nsay now that I always ‘knew’, certainly as a 5 year old, I didn’t understand what my behaviour/thoughts \nmeant. (Mitchell, 21 years)\nI can’t really remember. The process was gradual. I remember that I started to experience erections and \ncouldn’t figure out why. It was only after a long time that I began to associate that with people of the same \ngender. For a while I thought it must be a phase and that I couldn’t really be gay. And then sometime I just \nadmitted it. I can’t remember when or how; it was just a realisation that came to me over time. (Cooper, 21 \nyears)\nSome young people clarified their views after feeling a connection with characters and people from \nGLBTIQ media (including television, theatre, literature and music).\nAround puberty i always remember being attracted to the same sex but being attracted to males as well, \ni think that i didnt think too much of it until i actually made friends with a gay and considered that it really \n24 Writing Themselves in 3\nwasn’t that normal to be attracted to the same sex. i had a few months at a time, periods where i was very \nconfused and frustrated because i couldn’t talk about my mixed up emotions. but this year has really given \nme the chance to learn and understand myself better. i think i realised after watching tv shows like ‘the l \nword’ and listening to ani difranco or tegan and sara and feeling a connection with them. (Alyssa, 20 years)\ni was on the computer and my fav song at that time was all the things she said by tatu and i saw them \nkissing and i really liked it and i didnt no what it was doing to me i had feelings that i have never felt b4 and \ni really likdt that feeling and i guess thats what happened. (Tahlia, 16 years)\nThe following comments support the finding, particularly amongst young men, of an aversion to the \nheterosexual interactions with young women they were expected to enjoy:\ni left my girlfriend because i really wasn’t that into her being all over me. (Cameron, 16 years)\nAt the time i was in a relationship with a person of the opposite sex and it just wasn’t satisfying for me. I \nknew i was gay because i cared for my male friends more than i should. (Ryan, 17 years)\nwhen friends continuously talked about girls and sex, and I could never see the interest. (Jake, 18 years)\nYoung women often mentioned their attraction to breasts. This speaks to a discourse of physical desire \nthat is often missing in heterosexual young women’s talk around sex (Fine, 1988; Tolman, 2002; Hillier et \nal., 1999). It is evidence of young women being desiring subjects as well the objects of desire and has \nimportance for Sexuality Education in which desire is rarely allowed to be part of the agenda. \nBOOBIES -_- lol (Caitlin, 15 years).\nI found myself paying more attention to how women looked eg. eyes, mouth, breasts, etc. (Amelia, 20 \nyears)\nI used to always have pictures of girls on my wall. I love big breasts too. (Lauren, 19 years)\nI was in my brothers shed, the TV was on, and there were naked girls, i couldnt help myself but stare at \ntheir breasts. (Paige, 21 years)\nTraditional theories of sexual orientation offer at least two key explanations for same sex attraction: one \nfrom psychology describes a primarily stable trait (Cass, 1983/4; Troiden, 1984), the other from sociology \n(Fuss, 1991) describes sexuality as socially constructed. While some young people’s descriptions of first \nrealisation suggest that their attraction was thought of as an essential trait, there are also indications that \nthe social environment does impact on young people’s realisations by  providing a supportive space \nand words (or not) to explore these feelings. From these data there is more support for an in between \nexplanation that sexuality stems from a complex interaction of the body and the environment. \nWriting Themselves in 3 25 \nJosh’s story, 15 years \ni’ve found being gay hard but im happy with it, but if i had a choice it would be my last one. sometimes im \njealous of how straight people are so easily accepted in society, yet homosexuals can barely hold hands \nwithout people staring. things like mardi gras make me feel good about myself and give me hope for the \nfuture. i have a gay uncle to i knew that coming out to my family would be pretty easy and they would be \npretty understanding, and i was right, which really helped grow as a person knowing i had my families \nsupport. people at school were generally supportive, but homosexuality is something everyone talks about, \nso when i came out to a few friends, it wasn’t long before the whole school knew. the worst time in my \nlife was when some kids at my school got my phone number and started leaving voice messages on my \nphone saying abusive things… i have also found that people talk, and kids from other schools know who \ni am, so sometimes at the local shopping centre kids from other schools give me threatening looks as i \nwalk by. my good times have been with my boyfriends. my first kiss was my happiest moment. i felt like \nnothing could hurt me, and this made me sure of my sexuality. my hopes for the future are to become an \nactor/dancer and perform in britain and america. i want to meet a man, get married and have children, by \nadoption and surrogacy.\n26 Writing Themselves in 3\nWriting Themselves in 3 27 \n5. Sexual identity\nHeaps of people, straight people, don’t really seem to understand gayness and queerness and bisexuality. \nThats why I think that labels are still important, even if some people don’t like them. If straight people \ncan’t understand, or are not educated, then LGBT people become like a small club that makes up its \nown rules and removes itself from social realities. I am a lesbian, thats why I call myself one. However \nwhen I came out I knew I wanted to be sure that I was ready to speak about who I was to all the people \nwho had questions. And trust me, there were a lot of questions. I am happy being a lesbian. And I am \nhappy to use that fact to create positive discussion. The word bisexual became really important to me at \nabout the age 13. I had always had a fascination with anything gay, it seemed only normal I would think \nabout experimenting. However it soon became obvious to me that what I was feeling went way past \nexperimenting. The older, and more sexual/romantic I got, the more I realised that I wanted to be with \nanother girl, and another girl only. Lesbian is such a scary word, or at least thats what it felt like. Girls used \nit as a put down, and guys used it in lust. Irs a good thing I’m educated about bias against gays, and gay \npride, because that gave me the strength to be who I knew I was and be proud of it. (Audrey, 15 years)\nKey findings\n• In keeping with their attractions, 82% of young men identified as gay.\n• Young women were more likely to identify as bisexual (42%) than lesbian (39%).\n• Young people chose a sexual identity for a range of reasons, not all related to their sexual \nattractions.  \nAs in 1998 and 2004, and in keeping with Laumann’s three components of sexuality, - attraction, \nidentity and behaviour (Laumann, 1994) - we asked young people what identity label they attributed \nto themselves, if any. We expanded the categories from 2004 to include Queer and Questioning. The \ninclusion of the term, Questioning, reflected acknowledgement of the possibility that these young people \nmay still be coming to terms with, or deciding upon, their identity and the inclusion of the term Queer \nreflected our acknowledgement of social and cultural change. \nMost young men chose to label themselves as gay (82%) whereas young women were divided between \na lesbian (39%) and a bisexual (42%) identity (see Figure 6 below). In addition, 5% identified as \nQuestioning, 4% as Queer and 4% as Other. \n28 Writing Themselves in 3\nFigure 6. Identity choice by gender\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nGay/lesbian Bisexual Heterosexual Queer Questioning Other\nMale (n = 1263)\nFemale (n = 1760)\nGQ (n = 90)\nThere were also differences in the ways the under 18s and the older group identified their sexuality. A \nsimilar age difference to that uncovered in the 2004 survey showed that the older group was more likely \nto identify as gay/homosexual/lesbian (62%) than the younger group (50%). The term Queer was more \npopular with the older group (6%), but did make some appearance within the younger group (2%). \nOther identifications\nIn total, 144 participants did not choose one of the labels offered but instead selected the ‘other’ \ncategory. These young people were asked to specify their alternative choices in labels, and particular \ntrends emerged. Of the 144, 37% identified as pansexual, 11% disliked labels and the rest used \nresponses such as myself,  me or bi romantic. The pansexual identification — the prefix referring to all or \nwhole — encompasses all kinds of sexuality (Drobac, 1999) and could be understood as expressing the \nfull spectrum of desire. Of those young people who referred to their sexuality as pansexual, most were \nyoung women. \nWriting Themselves in 3 29 \nFigure 7. Identity choice by attraction\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nGay, homosexual, \nlesbian\nBisexual Heterosexual Queer Questioning Other\nAttracted to own sex only (n = 1775)\nAttracted to both sexes (n = 1166)\nUnsure (n = 154)\nFrom Figure 7 we can see that most young people who were exclusively same sex attracted, identified \nas gay/lesbian/homosexual (92%), 4% identified as queer, 2% other and 1% questioning.  Of those who \nwere attracted to both sexes, 73% identified as bisexual, 7% as questioning, 7% as gay/lesbian and \n4% as queer. In most cases the identity fitted neatly with attraction, and in a smaller group not so, for \nexample the 7% of both sex attracted young people and the 16% of unsure who identified as gay/lesbian. \nHowever, we know that identity, more than attraction and behaviour, is socially constructed and influenced \nby many other factors besides attraction, including especially, social approval.\n  \nFurther understanding identity and attraction\nYoung people were asked for explanations for their choice of identity. The 95% of young people who \nexplained their choice of identity in this survey talked about attraction, gender, social understandings and \nreactions to the terms, social beliefs about certain identities and the ways in which terms did and didn’t \nfit them. There were some differences in the reasons terms were mainly selected. For some, there was \nuncertainty and feeling outside of identity categories. \nFor young people identifying as gay/lesbian/homosexual, the range in certainty was striking. Those who \nwere same sex attracted only, felt that their selection of this term self-evident: for example, Mary (20, \nyears) There is nothing more to it. I am who I am... and Patrick (21, years) it’s simple; i’m only attracted to \nmembers of my own sex, so it’s easiest to label myself as ‘gay’.\nThere were also those who used gay/lesbian/homosexual while being both sex attracted. In some cases, \nit was simply seen as easier or more socially acceptable to make use of a homosexual identity. Lindsay \nexplained: \n30 Writing Themselves in 3\nI call myself a lesbian, because it is the simplest definition for most people. I am attracted to men \nsometimes, and I won’t rule out falling in love with a man, but more often than not, I’m attracted to women. \nThis is something most people just don’t get, so I just say I’m gay. (Lindsay, 18 years)\nSome of the young people using the gay/homosexual/lesbian label had been initially hesitant, feeling \nconcerned about the accompanying stereotypes that may be ascribed to them if they used it. For \nexample, Malcom  (20, years) made what was a notable distinction between his sexual identity and his \nway of acting, when he said I’m a gay male. I’m not overtly gay - physically or socially - I’m a homosexual \nwho is attracted to the same sex. Helen, who at the time of the survey used a lesbian identity but originally \nclaimed a bisexual identity explained:\nI think this apprehension was to do with the perceived stereotyping of each orientation. I am typically \n‘femme’, and I didn’t feel I could relate to the other gender ambiguous Lesbians in my year. I did tell a \nfew friends that I wasn’t straight, and I felt that by telling them I was Bisexual, I would be less likely to me \nmarginalised and ostracized like the other Lesbians in my year. I also felt that a Bisexual labelling would \nmake me appear less foreign to 13 year olds and keep my femininity intact. (Helen, 19 years)\nJim was typical of a small portion of young people who rejected this category even though it did in some \nsense apply. Like many who also chose the other category for social or political reasons, he said he \ndidn’t like labels: \nI know I’m gay it’s a fact but I don’t believe in labelling as all it does is give society excuse to segregate \nand isolate us from what they consider the normal way. (Jim, 19 years)\nUnder the bisexual category, there was also a range of certainty. There were those who were both sex \nattracted, such as, Tina (14 years), who felt quite clear on this identity choice: Bi. what else do you need?. \nThere were also many who qualified their response by explaining that gender was not their primary \nconcern in terms of their attraction or their feelings: I think that personality and charisma and looks are \nmore attractive than gender (Fiona, 18 years). However, this was not always the case; there were also \nthose in the bisexual category who expressed a preference towards one or the other sex (whilst still being \nsomewhat attracted to either). For example, Alan (14 years) said his sexuality was Simple: Bisexual, Male \npreference.\nAgain, there was evidence that sometimes bisexuality could be used as a transition point. Some young \npeople, such as Amanda (18 years), were unsure who they were attracted to and equally uncertain about \ntheir use of this label while they sorted out their sexual identity: \nI probably wouldn’t really call myself bisexual, because i know that I’m still not sure, and don’t think that I \nshould really slap a label on it just to satisfy others curiosity. probably though, I would be leaning towards \nlesbian more so than anything else. (Amanda, 18 years)\nFor those who were questioning, uncertainty was quite common. However, the location of this uncertainty \ndiffered. For some this was about their own identity and attraction; Jeff  (17 years) was attracted to both \nWriting Themselves in 3 31 \nsexes, and wrote: I am still not 100% sure where I lie in the spectrum of things. For others it was more \nfocussed on what their attractions would mean for them socially and how taking a particular label might \nlimit their lives. For example, Nelson (17 years) was only attracted to males, but wrote: I don’t want to be \ngay because I want to have a family and get married etc, but I can’t stop being attracted to guys. Others \nwere uncertain about whether their current attractions could change in the future:\nI’m not sure enough about myself to say that I’m bisexual, even though I am attracted to both females and \nmales at the present. I could see these feelings changing in the future and I would prefer not to lock myself \ninto anything while I’m still not 100% sure. (Leah, 18 years)\nFor people identifying as Queer, rejection of traditional gender binaries came through strongly: \nI just... am. I’ve never found a label that fits quite right. I don’t believe in the Male/Female binary, so \nbisexual doesn’t quite fit. I settle with queer because anything else is too complicated. (Rose, 20 years) \nFor Kylie and others, broad, inconsistent or variable attraction played an important part, more so than \ngender, as they were attracted to many people: \nI don’t see myself as only being attracted to ‘males’ or ‘females’, if I like someone their gender doesn’t \ncome into the picture. I feel I don’t conform to heteronormative standards. (Kylie, 18 years)\nHowever, there was also a theme of disliking or rejecting other terms that seemed to foreclose on sexual \nidentities, and the negative connotations that have been socially associated with them. For example, \nCarly (21 years) wrote: I hate the word lesbian and i like the word queer it doesnt sound as demeaning to \nme, while for Alice: \nI don’t like to pigeonhole myself as one thing or another, so queer works well for me. Bisexual has a very \nnegative connotation that I’d like to avoid, and I consider myself more pansexual than bisexual. (Alice, 21 \nyears)\nIn some cases, Queer was not used to indicate attractions (some people were only attracted to one sex) \nbut more a state of mind which was not limited by one’s own sexed body, as Nikki explained: \ni think queer also includes just generally not considering my actions and personality to be controlled by \ngender, although i do consider myself female, as well as sexuality. (Nikki, 21 years)\nFor pansexuals a reframing of gender was also usually important in their selection of the term, and there \nwas some overlap of use of both the words queer and pansexual for those identifying as either. For \nexample, Tony, (19 years), described pansexuality as basically bisexual, but without the gender binary \nthing. gender is more complicated then that. Reagan found his own experience of sex identity was the key \nto taking a broader view: \n32 Writing Themselves in 3\nI simply believe that, especially as a transperson, limiting attraction to people who are strictly male or \nfemale (therefore excluding those who are pre-operative transsexual or have an intersex condition, as well \nas those who identify as a gender other than these) would be an extremely black and white view of things. \n(Reagan, 17 years) \n \nThere were not many young people identifying as heterosexual in this study. But those who did had a \nmixture of certainty and uncertainty about this identity also. For example, Lisa (18 years) expressed some \nconfusion about being heterosexual and attracted to both sexes, particularly when she added but still like \nwomen.....i think........I DONT KNOW. It is important to mention also the young people who, like Warren, \nused the heterosexual label as a way of keeping their lives private: \nI would always answer to anyone that I was straight and keep secret any sexual thoughts towards other \nguys. I also keep my fathers sexuality a secret to anyone. (Warren, 20 years)\nHealth professionals, sex educators and others should note that sexuality labels do not predict \nsexual attractions or behaviours in a simplistic fashion, particularly for SSAGQ young people. Health \nprofessionals are particularly encouraged to take sexual histories and also talk about future sexual \npossibilities in a non-judgemental manner with young people, when determining the information, referrals \nand reproductive advice they may need.\nMaddison’s story, 17 years \nI could not accept my sexuality at first, it took awhile. For most of high school i claimed myself to be \nbisexual and pretended to like guys and hook up with them. I’d always feel so terrible after it, and i was \nmystified, even though deep down i think i knew it was because i really was gay. Just recently, i’ve started \naccepting myself and my sexuality, although it’s taken some time. Most people know now, although my \nfamily don’t mention it, even if i say i’m going to see my girlfriend or the girl i’m dating. At first, this hurt me \nso much because when i broke up with my boyfriend, my mum questioned it and told me to sort it out \nbecause she thought he was a nice guy. I never told her then it was because i couldn’t be with a guy and \nbe unhappy ‘cause they’re not what i want. It hurt so much when i was having trouble with a girl, and she \ndidn’t say anything, just listened because i knew she didn’t want to know. The friends i have been hanging \nout for the past few years are amazing, i have never met more accepting people ever who are crazy, funny \nand are in all the same interests as me (music, games, etc), and one of the girls i’m most closest to is \neven gay. She actually came out the same time as me, as we both used to say we were bisexual, not les. \nI understand why people hide it, and i don’t blame them. Noone wants to get hurt and rejected. Especially \nto others who have it harder then most because of religion, culture or family. In time, i know i’ll be even \nmore open then i am now, and i will 100% stop trying to be straight, or wishing it. I love the ladies, what \nelse can i say?\nWriting Themselves in 3 33 \n6. Sexual behaviours\nI currently have a friend with benefits kind of relationship with two friends, one male and one female and \nwe get together and have semi-regular threesomes. It’s a lot of fun and sometimes I wish I had a proper \nrelationship with one of them but other times I’m really happy with and grateful for the ways things are and \nthink a relationship would over complicate things. (Sarah, 19 years)\nKey findings\n• 28% of young people had never had sex.\n• Young men (56%) were more likely to have had exclusive same sex sexual encounters than \nyoung women (28%).\n• Young people were sexually active earlier than their heterosexual peers.\n• 10% of the 15-18 year old young women had been pregnant (twice the rate of their \nheterosexual peers).\n• 51% used a condom at their last penetrative sex.\n• Young women (74%) were more likely to have had sex than young men (69%).\n• 21% of young women had sex exclusively with men.\nSexual Experience \nWhen she first kissed me, I thought I was going to die.\nMy heart was in overdrive, I could barely breathe. \nShe was beautiful.\nShe was my first love. \nMy only love.I was thirteen and she was eighteen. \nIt didn’t make a difference to us.\nThat was the first and only time I saw her. (Tara, 16 years)\nYoung people were asked if and when they first engaged in a range of sexual practices including deep \nkissing, genital fondling, oral and penetrative sex. This is the same question as was in the SSASH study \n(Smith et al., 2009). They were also asked the gender of their sexual partners. The term sex was used \nfor sexual encounters in general (to be inclusive of lesbian sex) and penetrative sex for vaginal and anal \nintercourse with a penis. The questionnaire also included items about condom use, STIs, pregnancy and \nfor the first time, pregnancy outcomes.  \nSeventy-two per cent of young people (n=2213) reported that they had had sex in the past two years. \nYoung women (74%) were more likely to have had sex compared to young men (69%) and GQ young \npeople (69%). Young men (56%) were more likely to have had sex with men and young women were \nalmost as likely to have sex with both sexes (30%) and their own sex exclusively (28%), and 21% had sex \n34 Writing Themselves in 3\nexclusively with the opposite sex.  This is an example of the lack of congruence between attraction and \nbehaviour, particularly evident in young women. \nYoung people who mentioned religious discourse were less likely to have had sex (35%) as were young \npeople from a CALD background (35%).  \nIn terms of specific sexual practices, 88% of young people had experienced deep kissing, 84% had \ntouched partner’s genitals, 84% had had their genitals touched, 74% had given oral sex, 74% had \nreceived oral sex and 68% had experienced penetrative sex. A comparison of the 15-18 year olds with \nthe SSASH survey (Smith et al., 2009) showed that SSAGQ young people were more likely to have \nexperienced all types of sexual activity.\n \nFigure 8. Comparison of sexual activity between 15-18 year old SSAGQ students and their peers in the \n2008 SSASH survey\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nDeep Kissing Touch Genitals Oral Sex Penetrative Sex\nWTi3\nSSASH 2008\nFrom young people’s stories it is evident that they test out and try to resist feelings that are taboo. The \nfollowing quotes were typical; young women who experimented with people of both sexes and young \nmen who mainly experimented with their own: \nI had always had a fascination with anything gay, it seemed only normal I would think about experimenting. \nHowever it soon became obvious to me that what I was feeling went way past experimenting. The older, \nand more sexual/romantic I got, the more I realised that I wanted to be with another girl, and another girl \nonly. (Clara, 15 years)\nFrom 16 - 21 i have experienced many different types of relations with both men and women, from 16 - 19 \nyears of age i was in unhealthy relationships with men, one night stands,”seeing” guys that treated me \nunfairly and bfs who i lusted over but never felt comfortable with. (Melanie, 21 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 35 \ngrowing up i came across many other young boys willing to experiment with their sexuality/bodies. \n(Charlie, 19 years)\nIn terms of safe sex practices young people were asked: the last time you had penetrative sex – if it was \npenis/vagina or penis/anus – was a condom used? Fifty one percent reported using a condom during last \npenetrative sex, a figure that is lower than that in 2004 where 65% used a condom at last penetrative sex. \nYoung men were more likely to use a condom (58%) compared with young women (46%) and GQ (34%). \nOnly 45%  of 15-18 year olds used a condom at last penetrative sex compared with 65% of students in \nthe national SSASH survey (Smith et al., 2009). There were no differences in condom use according to \nreligion, ethnicity or age.  \nSexually transmitted infections \nPrevious reports have indicated that SSAGQ young people are at higher risk of sexually transmitted \ninfections (STI). Given that these young people were sexually active earlier, and that they were less likely \nto use a condom than their heterosexual peers, this is not surprising. Young people were asked if they \nhad ever been diagnosed with an STI. Five percent reported that they had, (6% young men, 4% young \nwomen, 9% GQ).  This number is lower than the 10% in the 2004 study. Young people from Aboriginal or \nTorres Strait Islander backgrounds (11%) and GQ young people (9%) reported higher rates than the rest \nof the young people in the study.  \nPregnancy\n \nThis was before i actually realized I was lesbian, I had sex with my boyfriend and we were both drunk and \nwe didn’t use a condom. I fell pregnant but I didn’t tell him… (Samantha, 17 years)\nIn the 1998 survey, we were conscious of the lack of social and emotional support that was available \nfor these young people and hence we were restricted in asking personal questions that could be \nupsetting. Since then, there has been an increase in support services and so an item was included about \npregnancy and the outcome of the pregnancy.\nStill going through the pregnancy. I am currently in an open relationship with the father [one guy I’ve been \nattracted to]. \nIn 2010, 15% of young women reported being pregnant at some time. Of those young women who \nreported a pregnancy 37% were exclusively attracted to women. It may also be that these young women \nare becoming pregnant through non sexual methods such as artificial insemination (AI) but there was little \nevidence of this from these young people’s stories. Megan and  Trish had children through heterosexual \nintercourse: I’ve  had two children to a guy I was with for 5 years, whom I am now separated from because \nof another girl, that we were both involved with. (Megan, 21 years) And Trish: I had a beautiful baby girl that \nI love with all my heart.  The father disappeared. (Trish, 17 years)\n36 Writing Themselves in 3\nYoung women from CALD backgrounds were less likely to have been pregnant.\nWhen we compared the pregnancy rate of the 15-18 year olds with the SSASH study (Smith et al, 2009) \nwe found that double the percentage of SSAGQ young women had been pregnant (10%) compared with \n5% of their heterosexual peers.  \nA follow on item asked if you answered yes to having been pregnant what happened with the pregnancy? \nOne third of those who had been pregnant reported live births, one third reported a miscarriage, 31% \nreported having terminations and 3% were pregnant at the time of filling out survey. \nAs mentioned previously, given that condom usage was lower in this group compared with those in the \n2004 survey, and that these young people were sexually active earlier than their heterosexual peers, it is \nno surprise that pregnancy rates were higher amongst these young people. A very small percentage of \nthe young women planned their pregnancies but the majority did not. This further highlights the need for \nimproved Sexuality Education and sexual health service provision.\nMy hopes for the future are to become a journalist and make a difference in the world! I want to write about \ncontroversial subjects, such as homophobia, religion (my view is that if “religion” is a system of beliefs \nwhich tell us what is right and wrong, then society itself is a religion. I can make a very good comparison \nbetween society and Christianity), politics, society and other big factors which we are all faced with \neveryday. \nI’m raising my son in a single parent family and have considered surrogate mothering for my sister and her \ngirlfriend to have a baby. I’m still indecisive about this and haven’t spoken to her about it as yet until I know \nfor sure its what I want to do. (Teah, 17 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 37 \nRelationship between sexual behaviour and attraction\nFrom Figure 9 below and previous data on young men’s sexual attraction and identity, most young men \nhad congruence between the three aspects of their sexuality. However, one in five young women, despite \ntheir sexual attractions, continued to have sex exclusively with the opposite sex (21%). This and the lack \nof appropriate and relevant Sexuality Education for these young people women, explains our findings \nthat SSA young women are more likely to be diagnosed with an STI and to have been pregnant than their \nopposite sex attracted peers (Smith et al., 2009). It also is evidence of what can happen when certain \nsexualities are regarded as transgressive and young women try to prove to themselves that they are \n‘normal’. \nFigure 9.

How do people  \ntreat you?\nMy mum called me a lesbian when I was about 15, in a derogatory way. \nMy sister told me I will burn in hell and I am an abomination. \nA guy from some so called Christian place said it was evil.  \nI know they are wrong. I know I am loved and lovable, \nand God doesn’t discriminate against me if I am gay. \nI have learnt to hold my head high and not take their bullshit, \nit’s not my problem and they ought to work on and overcome their homophobia. \nThe government needs to show an example to them by allowing full equality for all Australians.  \n(Tracey, 20 years)\nKey findings\n• 61% of young people reported verbal abuse because of homophobia.\n• 18% of young people reported physical abuse because of homophobia.\n• School was the most likely place of abuse – 80% of those who were abused.\n• 69% reported other forms of homophobia including exclusion and rumours.\n• Young men and GQ young people reported more abuse than young women.\nWe learned from the previous two national reports that same sex attracted young people suffer high \nlevels of verbal and physical homophobic abuse in the community and particularly at school. A smaller \nnumber suffer homophobic abuse in their homes. These findings replicate international research and \nrepresent a world-wide problem which is, to varying degrees, being addressed. (Cochran et al., 2002; \nElia, 2005; Miceli, 2002) \nMuch has been done to counteract homophobic abuse in Australia in the intervening twelve  years \nbetween the first Writing Themselves In report in 1998 and WTi3 in 2010 including the training of teachers, \nthe introduction in some states of inclusive policies in education, funding for community development \nprojects, social support groups and alliances and the production of anti-homophobia resources. In \n2004 we found there were no reductions in homophobic abuse from 1998, however, there were other \nimprovements in the supports available to this group, including those at school. \nIn this section we report first on levels of abuse, where the abuse occurred and who was responsible and \nthen we report on differences in abuse according to gender, age, ethnicity, religion and rurality.\n40 Writing Themselves in 3\nVerbal abuse\n[I’ve been told]\nthat im going to hell because im gay. \nthat a good hard cock will change my mind. \nthat being gay is evolutions way of killing me off.  \nthat i dont know myself enough to know im gay.  \nthat i should be shot at or killed. \nthat i’m fucked in the head because i am gay. (Christy, 19 years)\nIn response to the question: Has anyone been abusive to you because of your sexuality? 34% reported \nno verbal abuse, 61% reported verbal abuse and 18% physical (and often verbal) abuse. In terms of \ngender, young men (70%) and GQ youth (66%) reported more verbal abuse than young women (53%).\nDespite the work that has been done in schools and the community to address homophobia, \npercentages of young people who reported verbal abuse (61%) were higher than in previous studies \n(46% in 1998; 44% in 2004). However we observed no new discursive forms of homophobia emerging \nand this is encouraging. As in the previous two national studies, the abuse in 2010 was based on \nnegative positioning of same sex sexuality including that it is evil, a mental illness, abnormal, a phase \nand the path to a miserable life. That there are no new forms emerging can be seen as a positive thing, \nindicating that homophobia is not changing and current ways of addressing it are likely to be effective \nin the longer term. We do, however, see many new creative resistant beliefs emerging as young people \nreach out to other young people like themselves and tap into gay culture through the internet and media.\nThough we hesitate to repeat in this report the tirade of abuse that these young people endured, we have \nincluded a small number of the thousands of descriptions of verbal abuse reported by young people in \n2010. They include crude and profoundly distressing insults:\nYou name it. Faggot, butt pirate, ass licker, fag, gay, homo; are just some of the examples..... Growing in a \nboys school did not make life easy because everythings “so gay”. “That’s pretty gay”. (Mike, 21 years)\noh, all the typical insults such as: “you’re sick.” “this isn’t normal.” “eww.” “you’re sinning.” “god hates \nhomosexuals.” “you’re going to burn in hell.” “you’ll get what’s coming to you.” etc. (Ruth, 20 years)\nyour a fucking disgusting faggot” “your a dirty cock sucker” “god hates you” “your gay because your \ndaddy raped you arnt ya?  (Ray, 17 years) \nYoung girls at school used to say things along the lines of; \n“oh here she comes, cross your legs ladies”\n“Before you even ask, no you can’t fuck me you fag”\n“Maybe if you took the stick from your a** and replaced it with a c**** you’ll be normal” (Molly, 17 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 41 \nThey also included threats of physical harm:\nPeople frequently yell at me as I walk down the street, most likely because I’m relatively effeminate, for \na boy (It’s kind of hard not to be when you’re not technically male). I suffered a lot of transphobic abuse \nat my high school.… A group of boys in my year used to regularly threaten me with physical violence \n(“If you’re a boy, we can hit you”) and sexual assault (“We should prove to you that you’re a girl”, often \naccompanied by being pushed into walls.) They would also often show me pornography in class, often of \na lesbian or transsexual nature, by shoving phones and iPods into my face. (Reagan, 17 years)\nDeath threats were sent to me via mobile phone. (Brock, 14 years)\nI was texted only once randomly by an unknown number, although it was evidently some people from \nschool. the message was simply “we are going to follow you home and stab you”. Needless to say I was \nnot exactly terrified; I have done many years of boxing and if someone is going to stab you I doubt they’d \nwarn you like that. I think I actually laughed. (Robbie, 18 years)\nThese threats are an escalated form of verbal violence and have increased potential to cause \npsychological harm to young people. Anonymous threats, and indeed all threats can be damaging, \nespecially given that homophobic assault is a reality in these young people’s lives. \nPhysical abuse\nI have been assaulted on one occasion, they assumed cause I was gay that I couldn’t defend myself. \nDon’t worry... They learnt very quickly. I also have a large group of friends that are very protective of me, all I \nhave to do is send a text and a convoy of cars arrive at my aid (Rupert, 17 years)\nhad fag cut into my back in three places then fuck here with a arrow pointing to arsehole across my but \nthen held and repeatedly abused with sticks  (Stuart, 21 years)\nI personally haven’t been physically abused, however, one particular case of homophobic abuse has hit \nrather close to home and left me emotionally bruised. My brother was bashed up at a local club by two \nguys who assumed he was gay (He actually isnt, but thats beside the point) so the thought that my big \nbrother could get so hurt for something he ISNT really worried me as to what could happen to me for \nsomething I AM. I havent gone out to a club or pub or anywhere where people are drinking since then \nbecause of that fear, and given that happened a couple years ago, I’m the one 20 year old I know that isnt \ngoing out to clubs, or has ever been out to a club for that matter. (Becky, 20 years)\nAs mentioned previously, 18% of young people reported being physically assaulted because of \ntheir sexuality, an increase from 2004 (15%) and 1998 (13%). These assaults were more likely to be \nperpetrated against young men (23%) and particularly GQ young people (31%), though assaults against \nyoung women (14%) were at least as high as physical  assaults in the 1998 study. \n42 Writing Themselves in 3\nYoung people described being assaulted by a range of people in their lives including family, strangers \nand peers. In some cases the assaults sustained little physical damage and in other cases young people \nwere hospitalised because of their injuries. \nMy mother initiated a fist-fight. She began to hit me out of anger because of my sexual orientation. (Mary-\nanne, 15 years)\ni have been beat up numerous times since coming out at 14/15 at school. I was beat up by 3 men at a \nlocal pub because i wouldn’t talk them about my sexual encounters, or go home with them. i also got beat \nand kicked out by my dad when he found out i was gay. (Talon, 20 years)\nDragged behind a tool shed and beaten once... otherwise just generally chased and pushed. (Roxanne, \n20 years)  \nOnce in a PE change-room I had someone throw their testes in my face with a massive crowd around \nthem all laughing and pushing me around.. it was the most demoralising moment of my life. I’ve managed \nto get over this on my own but today I wish I talked to people about it. I guess I didn’t really think much of it \nat the time (Jack, 16 years) \nOften the assaults occurred in public places and a common theme was bystander apathy and neglect by \npeople who had a duty of care. \nI was at a local pub where I had a rainbow flag logo on the side of my arm on my shirt. An English guy \ncame out from the side and punched me in the head and called me a faggot. He threw his beer on me \nand then shoved me to the ground - my best friend was a few chairs away and stepped in and punched \nhim in the stomach. The guy then backhanded my best friend in the side of his head. We walked away as \nsecurity was just staring at us and told us it was best we leave as we were causing “controversy”. I live in a \nlow income suburb so I know that this is a major factor in this guys behaviour!  (Ricardo, 21 years)\nmyself and 6 of my friends were targeted on a late night train and bashed by a group of 25-30 people aged \nmid teens to early 20’s, many of us were hospitalised from the brutal attack, and sustained horrific injury, \nthe police arrived on the scene at the train station, ignored our complaints, and allowed our attackers \nto leave, QR video surveillance recorded the entire incident and to my knowledge, nobody has been \ncharged. (Charlie, 19 years)\nIt is difficult for those of us who are working towards social change to be anything but discouraged by \nthese rising levels of homophobic abuse.  The examples of abuse used in this report are typical rather \nthan the extreme. More troubling is the ubiquitousness of the abuse which can be seen to create what \nLeonard (2008) refers to as an everyday culture of harassment which young people accept as their due. It \nis not unreasonable to assume that many SSAGQ young people live with this expectation of violence and \nabuse and have no expectation of bystander support or redress from teachers, parents or police. The \nevidence that this unacceptable situation  is increasing in severity must be taken seriously by all those \nwho have some power to change it. We cannot allow young people to continue to manage it alone or to \nbe exposed so regularly to incidents which cannot fail to compromise their health and wellbeing.\nWriting Themselves in 3 43 \nOther types of homophobic abuse\ni have never been confronted face to face with verbal abuse but, around school people always thought/\nknew i was gay so snide remarks from people as i walked by or word of mouth around school about words \nbeing directed at me happened often but i never gave thought to that kind of thing cause it wasn’t worth it \nto care what a few lower IQ’s thought about me. (Jonathon, 18 years) \nIn the 2010 study we included measures of ‘other homophobia’ that had been described to us, \nparticularly by young women in previous studies. Sixty-nine percent reported being subjected to at least \none other type of homophobic abuse with the most frequent being rumours (58%), tolerating homophobic \nlanguage (46%), social exclusion (39%) and humiliation (32%). Less common forms were written abuse \n(14%) and graffiti (9%). \nFigure 10.

If they didn’t call me a fag, I probably wouldn’t have taken any notice, but \nas I went to walk down the concrete stairs to my class the two girls ‘tripped’ and pushed me down the \nstairs and onto the concrete floor at the bottom. I had a blood nose, split lip and mild concussion. The two \ngirls stood at the top of the stairs and laughed until the noticed a teacher coming their way. They got no \npunishment because the teacher believed their story about it being an accident. (Lucy, 15 years)\nYoung people were asked to identify where they experienced homophobic abuse and 80% experienced \nthe reported abuse at school (see Figure 11 below). This figure is higher than that of the previous two \nsurveys (74% in 2004; 69% in 1998).  Much work has been done in schools over the last decade to \naddress homophobia and the increase may in part be due to a number of factors such as SSAGQ young \npeople being more likely to be ‘out’ and therefore more likely to be aware of homophobia as well as being \nmore visible targets for abuse. We are, in Australia in 2010, in the midst of substantial social change \nwhich has brought in its wake more inclusive laws in terms of sexual difference, broad-based and positive \nmedia visibility, high profile gay and lesbian adults and a range of protections and supports for SSAGQ \nyouth. Many changes for the good are occurring in schools as well, however, there is considerably more \nwork to be done in schools before they provide SSAGQ students with the safe haven they are entitled to \nexpect.\nSport was reported overall as the place of least abuse, however, young men and GQ youth were over \nrepresented in this figure (young men 15%, young women 8%, GQ 18%). The abuse of young men in \nsport has been a consistent finding in all three Writing Themselves In reports and the higher percentage \nof abuse of GQ young people occurred in all venues. Homophobia in Australian sport was the subject of \na recent report titled: Come out to play (Symons et al., 2010) and includes the abuse of SSAGQ young \npeople and adults. In that study, 41% of participants had experienced homophobic abuse in sport and \nalmost half the participants were not out when the participated in mainstream sport, indicating that this \nmay remain a lifelong problem for SSAGQ young people. \nWriting Themselves in 3 45 \nFigure 11. Comparison of place of abuse: 1998, 2004, 2010\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nSchool Street Home Social occasion Sport Other Work (new in \n2010)\n1998\n2004\n2010\nBecause school remains the most likely place for abuse of SSAGQ youth, their stories of abuse often \nmentioned school and abuse taking place without teacher intervention.  \ni used to get beaten up at school because i am a dyke. one day i had about 8 guys all in circle spear \ntackle me to the ground and kicking me, i used to get fruit thrown at my head every lunch time and pushed \ninto brick walls. (Christie, 20 years)\nI don’t know whether this counts as abuse, but guys who suspected i was gay at school used to touch me \nand grope me suggestively and say suggestive things, which although sometimes I was aroused, I still felt \nvery uncomfortable having my personal space violated. (Ronan, 20 years)\nThe young person quoted in this last example went on to describe how he left the school and moved \nto the TAFE system, a common pathway for many young people who suffer abuse at school. However, \nwe have also learned that SSAGQ young people can be safe at school through the implementation \nof appropriate policies and practices. The following example demonstrate that schools can stop \nhomophobic abuse, by intervening and changing the culture of the school:\nI was beaten up a couple of times, in early high school, once was very bad with three other people \ninvolved. After this time, the staff intervened and it never happened again. (Terry, 18 years)\nEven more encouraging were the examples of schools that not only worked against homophobia but that \nalso celebrated sexual diversity in their student population:\nmy high school is very gay friendly. They promote a lot of awareness and encourage a lot. They also \nparticipate in pride marches. (Roxanne, 18 years)\n46 Writing Themselves in 3\nTwenty-four percent of young people who were abused suffered abuse at home. This was often by their \nparents, some experiencing verbal abuse and others physical. This figure is higher than in previous \nstudies (2004 18%; 1998 16%). Fathers were more likely to physically assault their children but, in some \ncases, mothers did as well. The following young man’s parents reacted badly when they suspected he \nmight be gay. He described feeling very unsafe at home.\nLike I’ve said above, at one point they suspected I was gay (left something open on the computer. Those \nthings will be the death of me!) I was locked into a room (by my parents and brother), much like an \ninterrogation. Physically and mentally abused for a few hours and “released” after I’d  kept saying I will kill \nmyself (although, their reply was “Either kill yourself or we will kill you”) (Peter, 15 years) \nThe following assault by a father was an extreme example which unquestionably would have had a long \nterm impact on his daughter. \ni got 3 broken ribs, a broken collar bone, a punctured lung, my jaw broken in 2 different places and 7 of my \nteeth got punched out when my father found out i was a homosexual. (Sian, 19 years)\nThough this young woman received support from her mother, at the time of the survey she was \nunemployed and living in a squat. \nDespite the workplace being the second least common site of abuse (17%), there were a number of \ndescriptions of abuse that occurred there. The following case also illustrates the fear in many perpetrators \nof abuse of being regarded as an object of desire, and explains in part why change rooms and toilets are \nmost common places of assault of SSA young men by young men. \nI was at work and this guy in the locker room thought I was looking at him so he grabbed my arm and did \nthat weird thing where it twists and ends up behind your back, two days later I found out it was fractured \n(that was fun explaining) (Joey, 17 years)\nMany people described verbal and physical abuse in the street (35%), though it is less common than in \nprevious studies (2004 47%; 1998 45%). In the first case, the young woman was left alone and naked in a \npark at night and in the second example, friends stepped in and stopped the abuse.\nBeaten, stripped and left in a park at night. (Susie, 17 years)\nI was at the station with my girlfriend and a few other friends, I was walking over to get on a bus to go \nhome -- my girlfriend coming with me -- and these people from various schools around me came up to us \nand started verbally abusing us, calling us faggots and losers, how we should go home and stop being \ndisgusting “carpet-munchers”. I got my girlfriend to get on the bus -- she’s younger than me, I feel a strong \nurge to protect her -- and told her to get a seat, that it’ll be fine, and when I turned around one of them \npunched me in the face for “being a self-righteous lesbian cunt who needs to be taught a lesson”. They \nthen proceeded to grab my bag and throw it onto the road, destroying everything inside as cars ran over \nit, and attempted to sexually abuse me, ripping my clothes. Thankfully, some friends of mine who knew the \noffenders came up and told them to back off and leave me alone. (Marina, 17 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 47 \nSocial occasions (40%), especially parties were also a common place of abuse, in part because of the \nconsumption of alcohol. \nI was bashed at a party once for being gay. The guy snuck up on me and punched me in the head, and I \nwas knocked out for a while, where him and his friend kicked me. People came and broke it up and I got \naway with just a few grazes (Mickey, 18 years)\nat a party when i was 15, i was attacked by several straight men, where i then ran from them when i could \nget up, and a passing motorist stopped and took me to the hospital........i remember telling my nan that id \nwalked into my friends door, and fallen down a few of the stairs in their staircase. (Hugh, 20 years)\nFigure 12.

Links between  \nabuse and negative health \nindicators\n i was attacked at school with a large tree branch across the face. People would walk right up to me in \nthe canteen and punch me in the face. People would follow me around and throw their lunch/drinks at \nme. one of them cut my long hair in class and lit it on fire. I guess thats why i sought mental help. (Jan, 16 \nyears)\nYes i have been “bashed up” before, going on about 10 times now and still ongoing, the first few were ok \njust a couple of school yard fights they were fine, than it got worse as i got older and went from a punch \nin school to being on the ground getting kicked, and then attempted rape once as well. As i was saying \nbefore it is something i have gotten used to and i have taken steps to prevent it now, i have been taking \nlessons in self defence.  (Bern, 20 years)\nKey Findings\n• Homophobic abuse was associated with feeling unsafe, excessive drug use, self harm and \nsuicide in young people.\n• For more than half of the participants, homophobic abuse impacted on a range of aspects of \nschooling.\nIn the 2004 study, we divided young people into three separate groups: those who reported no abuse, \nthose who reported verbal abuse only and those who reported verbal and physical abuse. We then \nexplored the relationship between level of abuse and feeling unsafe, excessive drug use, self harm and \nsuicide. \nAbuse and feeling safe\nYoung people who had suffered verbal abuse, but not physical abuse were less likely to feel safe in all \nplaces, including at home, at sport, in the street, at school, at work and on social occasions than those \nwho had not suffered abuse (see Figure 13). Those who had suffered physical assault were least likely to \nfeel safe in all places particularly at school, at sporting events and in the street. This finding is significant \nand consistent with the 2004 data. Despite sport being a place where a relatively low amount of abuse \ntook place (12%), young people generally felt least safe there, especially those who had suffered physical \nabuse. This was especially the case for young men. However, the finding is strongest at school, with only \n38% of those who had been physically assaulted feeling safe at school. It hardly needs to be said that \nschool is one place where we, as a community, expect young people to be kept safe. In fact, we think of \nthe school staff as in loco parentis while young people are at school and we expect them to take good \ncare of our children. \n50 Writing Themselves in 3\nFigure 13.

I have acted and failed on those thoughts a few times. I am never \nable to actively harm myself (i.e cut myself) but I’ve wanted to many times. I would say any gay person \nwho says that they have never even thought about suicide is lying. Not being able to act on any of your \ndesires, having to actively hide your true self, often having to pretend to hate the very thing you are. All of \nthese things equates to a deep feeling that you don’t deserve to live, or failing that, a deep desire to end \nthe suffering. On a happier note, coming out has turned my life around. All of those things mentioned are \nstarting to become a thing of the past.  (Christopher, 20 years)\nYoung people were asked about four separate issues: whether they had thought about self harm; had \nself harmed; had thought about suicide or had attempted suicide as a result of homophobia and we \ncompared these findings with the three levels of abuse mentioned in the section on verbal abuse. \nWriting Themselves in 3 51 \nFigure 14. Relationships between homophobic abuse, self harm and suicide \n \n \nSimilar to the findings in 2004, Figure 14 shows strong relationships between abuse and self harm at \nall four levels. Almost double the number of young people who had been verbally abused (40%), in \ncomparison with those who had experienced no abuse, had thought of self harm (22%). Three times \nthose who had been physically abused (62%), in comparison with those who reported no abuse, \nhad thought of self harm. This pattern was repeated through self harm, suicidal thoughts and suicide \nattempts. For example, in comparison with those who reported no abuse, twice the number of young \npeople who suffered verbal abuse, had attempted suicide and four and a half times the number of young \npeople who had been physically assaulted, had attempted suicide. \nWe asked young people to tell us more about their experiences of self harm and suicide. Some, who had \nwritten ‘none of the above’ described self harm unrelated to homophobia and many who chose ‘none of \nthe above’ wrote about why they would never hurt themselves. The following young people were typical:\nI have contemplated suicide. I have also performed self harm. However neither of these were because of \nhomosexuality or homophobia. (Joachim, 15 years)\nWhilst I have thought about suicide when I was younger, it was more related to my denial of my \nhomosexuality and not wanting to grow up “gay”; rather than overt homophobia per se. To me, it was just a \nphase and I have learnt from it. I never acted on anything and would not harm myself. (Trevor, 21 years)\nMany young people had thoughts of self harm and suicide but had never acted on them. James wrote:\nIt was more myself thinking that i was not normal, that i wasnt allowed to be gay that made me sad. With \nall the pressures i was getting from the outside world, and then myself amplifying it, it was becoming too \n52 Writing Themselves in 3\nmuch. This escalated until i was 14-15. Though, instead of buckling in and committing suicide, i stopped \nand thought “Hey, if this is who i am, this is who i am. I have to live with myself for the rest of my life, so \ni might as well be happy.” I finally believed in myself, and accepted myself. I was, and still am happy. \n(James, 17 years)\nYoung people who reported self harm often mentioned the scars as a reminder of dark times:\nit gets me down wen people don’t accept me for who i am.  now i’m learning to deal with it but as a result \nof this i now have many scars i have to live with. (Patricia, 16 years)\nHomophobia, confusion and quite a few other things, led me to self harm (cut myself) through all of year \n8 (when I was 13) to half way through year 9 (14)I regret it a lot because of the scars it left but I didn’t \nhave much of a support from any direction, or advice, and counsellors and parents both proved to have \na completely unhelpful attitude. So I didn’t know which way to turn and that way presented itself to me. \n(Robyn, 16 years)\nThose who reported suicidal thoughts and attempts did so because they either found life either too \ndifficult or because they felt that their loved ones would be better without them. Depression was regularly \nmentioned as a precursor to a suicide attempt:\nthere’s not really much to say, aside from six years of depression, i feel that being treated like dirt re: my \nsexuality added to my lack of self esteem, depression and definitely contributed to self harm and thoughts \nof suicide. (Tracey, 20 years)\nMy existence seemed to be a burden on my family growing up, and when I came out to them, it just \nseemed to create such an emotional strain. I thought that maybe if I just went away, that things might be \nalright for them again. (Stefan, 19 years)\nwhen i get extremely depressed i think about suicide and how it would be easier to get out now (Toby, 15 \nyears)\nAs discussed earlier, suicide attempts were significantly related to abuse; however, support could \nameliorate the impacts of abuse, and rejection could exacerbate it. In Chapter 11 we will examine in more \ndetail the ways that rejection by various community and family members plays out on young people’s self \nharm and suicidal behaviours. In the following example, Thalia suffered rejection from her mother and \nwas sent to boarding school with terrible consequences:\nDue to my mother’s homophobia I was sent to a strict Catholic boarding school where I was forced to \nscrub floors and walls on my hands and knees and pray multiple times a day. I am not religious and it \nwas an extremely homophobic environment. Within a month I was on anti-depressant and expelled after \nattempting suicide because ‘Suicide is a sin and so it was not acceptable to take part in the school’  \n(Thalia, 17 years)\nDeclan, who was 15 at the time of the survey, wrote about how having support stopped him from \nattempting suicide and supportive people were also responsible for him eventually stopping harming \nWriting Themselves in 3 53 \nhimself. Daisy also described how thoughts about self harm and suicide stopped when her family and \nher friends supported her:\nI self harmed for about 6 months, and thought heavily about suicide, but I couldn’t bring myself to do \nit, because there are still people that care about me, and they are also the people that stopped me self \nharming. (Declan, 15 years)\nused to think about it  a lot when i was at school but not anymore after being accepted by my family and \nfriends (Daisy, 20 years)\nVery often the loneliness and alienation that comes with knowing about one’s sexual difference, before \ntelling anyone, was a time of danger for these young people. Steve had self harmed and attempted \nsuicide before he came out:\nWhen i was in the closet and was being called names because i was gay and i didnt accept that at this \npoint i got depression and then when i did accept who i was i still had depression because i was in a \ncatholic school and i didnt know anyone else like me in the school (Steve, 19 years)\nThough a certain amount of homophobia is about gender transgression, Reagan, a transgender f–m \nyoung man, felt that transphobia, not homophobia, was the cause of his serious self harming and suicidal \nattempts:\n \nHomophobia, once again, didn’t affect me as much as transphobia. I left school/let my grades slip \nbecause I truly believed I couldn’t live in this world, and that I wouldn’t need an education because I’d kill \nmyself before it mattered. I suffered severe clinical depression (which still affects me, to a lesser extent) \nand self harmed constantly and to a physically dangerous extent - I stopped it a year and several months \nago and I still have large, visible scars. (Reagan, 17 years)\nDrug Use \ni stopped taking drugs heavily at 18. be4 that i was a daily uses of E and pot and booze. 19 i stopped \ndrinking daily. now am a youth worker and nursing uni student. have good support from family and friends \nand if someone called me a fag i could happily ignore it (Alana, 18 years)\nwell my life is bad.. i was kicked out of home at 15 when i came out.. could not attend school because my \nteachers used to throw objects at me and not let me sit near them + after school i would get bricks and \nrocks thrown at me and was not able to catch the bus or walk home safely, so because i havent finished \nyear 10 i cannot be as successful in life as i want to be.. after moving out i was poor had no money. had \nno one to go to. i then started drugs, i believe now that i am older i still suffer depression.. miss being able \nto be able to go to school and do things like normal teenagers instead of having to support myself and be \npoor.. i tent to not have trust in anyone after going to my high school.(Tim, 20 years)\n54 Writing Themselves in 3\nAustralian and international research has documented higher levels of drug use in non heterosexual \npopulations with these patterns of higher drug use generally beginning in adolescence (Fergusson et al., \n2005; Murnane, 2003; Smith, et al.,  2009; Hillier et al., 1998; Hillier et al., 2005). \nDrug cultures are constantly changing in Australia, with trends in use following availability and price. For \nthis reason we have extended the list of drugs in this study to include amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, \ninhalants, sedatives, hallucinogens, non-prescribed stimulants and heroin. Young people were also \nasked whether they had injected drugs. \nA comparison of  rates of weekly alcohol use, use of marijuana ever and ever having injected drugs with \nthe SSASH study (Smith et al., 2009) show that the 15 -18 year  old SSAGQ young people were more \nlikely to consume alcohol weekly, use marijuana and to inject drugs. This is consistent with findings from \nprevious studies. \nA comparison between drug use in 1998, 2004 and 2010 studies of same sex attracted young people \nshows that young people’s heroin and injecting drug practices are lower; however, levels of excessive \nuse of drugs tells a more comprehensive story. Forty-eight percent (1400) of young people drank alcohol \nat least weekly, 9% were smoking marijuana at least weekly, 23% were smoking cigarettes daily, 9% were \nusing amphetamines at least monthly, 1% had taken cocaine more than once, 3% had used ecstasy at \nleast monthly, 3% had taken inhalants at least monthly, 9% had taken sedatives at least monthly, 3% had \ntaken hallucinogens more than once, 2% had taken non-prescribed stimulants more than once and 2% \nhad taken heroin and 4% had injected drugs. Young women were more likely to excessively use a range \nof drugs than young men, for example, alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and sedatives; however, GQ young \npeople were most likely  to use all drugs except for alcohol and cigarettes. \nThere has been a tendency in the literature to think of the higher rates of drug use in GLBTI adults as \nconnected with sociability and the gay lifestyle, however this has recently been challenged (Leonard, \n2008). Research with SSAGQ youth suggests that higher rates of drug use are associated with \nhomophobic abuse. We have concluded that many of these young people are in fact self medicating to \nease the pain of the rejection and hostility in their families, schools and communities. James’ story below \nis an example. \nI grew up in a homophobic family. I came out at the age of 13 and was forced out of home. I lived through \nyouth shelters and at times on the street. I was unable to eat much and turned to cutting myself. I turned \nto drugs and alcohol. One day I decided it was time to grow up and take care of myself. noone else was \ngoing to do it for me. I set myself up on centrelink at age 16 started working and got myself set up in youth \nhousing. I am now studying at Central Queensland University and looking to become a psychologist who \ncan help others who are in the situation i was. I’m loud, proud and now at last respected because of my \nefforts in life. (James, 18 years)\nThe following section examines young people’s drug use as a correlate of abuse.\nWriting Themselves in 3 55 \nHomophobic abuse and drug use \nIn past studies we have found a relationship between the homophobic abuse of young people and higher \nrates of excessive drug use. As before, we looked at excessive drug use (see Figure 15 below) of the \nthree groups, young people who experienced no abuse, young people who experienced verbal abuse \nonly and those who were physically assaulted.  In all cases drug use was significantly related to abuse \nwith those reporting no abuse being least likely to use drugs excessively followed by those who were \nverbally abused and finally those who were physically assaulted. These findings show the same pattern \nas that of the 2004 study.\n \nFigure 15. Relationship between abuse and excessive levels of drug use\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nAlcohol -\nweekly\nMarijuana -\nweekly\nCigarettes -\ndaily\nEcstasy -\nmonthly\nHeroin -\never\nInjecting drugs -\never\nNever experienced abuse\nExperienced verbal abuse only\nExperienced physical abuse\nHomophobic abuse and schooling\nPeople at my high school found out I was a Lesbian and after school one day, a group of six (girls \nand boys) shoved me against the wall and punched me and kicked me until a teacher saw what was \nhappening. I had one of my teeth punched out, my lip split open, cracked ribs, severe bruising on my face \nand body and head trauma. I left the school that week, and now I’m happily attending TAFE where I am \naccepted (Veronica, 17 years).\nIn a new item in this survey, we asked young people: In what ways, if at all, has homophobia impacted on \nyour schooling? There were 13 multiple response items including It hasn’t affected me at all and other. The \ncomplete list can be seen in Appendix 1. \n56 Writing Themselves in 3\nIt was pleasing to see that almost half of the sample reported that homophobia had not affected their \nschooling (42%). One young woman who reported no effects of homophobia commented:\nAsked them did they really think it bothered me? I’ve dealt with worse than petty rumours. They stopped, \nbecause they realised it didnt affect me. (Bethany, 18 years)\nThirteen percent of young people reported that the impact of homophobia on them was to fight back and \nbecome activists. Mickey is an example:\nI have encountered a lot of homophobia in my life...I’ve been bullied in every way imaginable, been gay \nbashed, been treated unfairly. And while it almost got the better of me when it was at its worst, all its done \nnow is make me a much stronger person, and so fiercely committed to fighting for gay people’s rights. I do \nnot accept homophobic behaviour around me in the slightest. I’m currently working my way towards a Law \ndegree, so I can eventually one day become a prosecutor, fight for gay rights, and one day become a High \nCourt Judge, just like Michael Kirby. I want to help make Australia a better place for gay people, and I know \nI will. I hope this survey helps make things better for gay youth. I was happy to do it. (Mickey, 18 years)\nFor others, however, there were serious impacts with 29% not being able to concentrate in class, 20% \nmissing classes and 21% missing days at school with marks dropping for 20%. Impacts on school career \nwere particularly severe when young people felt they had no support at school.\n \nI didn’t really feel like I could do anything, didn’t feel like i had any support. I doubted my school would \nhave really helped. (Pablo, 21 years)\nSome young people used avoidance behaviour, for example, 18% hid at recess and lunch and/or did not \nuse change rooms (16%) and toilets (9%). Rodney, is one example:\nI struggled a bit through years 9/10. Coming from a rural town, I did have to endure quite an amount of \nphysical comedy at my expense. The change rooms before and after PE were the worst, you always had \nyour back turned on at least some of the other boys. You never knew what they would do - hit you, trip you. \nI was the only openly gay boy at my 7-10 school, and one of about 4 and my year 11/12 school. I have no \nissues with my sexuality myself, but derogatory words such as “fag” said under breath as people walk past \ndoes sometimes get me down. (Rodney, 17 years)\nWe have learned from past research that toilets and change rooms can be dangerous places for young \nmen in particular, and they pay a high price for trying to maintain their safety, for example, 13% dropped \nout of sport and other activities. \nIn terms of education, the most serious impacts were that young people left their school to go to another \n(10%) or left school altogether (8%). The following young man left school after being abused by the \nparent of another student, complaining to the principal and having nothing done about it. \nWriting Themselves in 3 57 \nAt my Christian High School I was approached by a parent of a schoolmate who informed me that I was \n‘Bringing an unwholesome agenda into the school” followed by various statements about satan, sin etc \netc. I spoke with the principal of the school, and eventually left the school as I felt as though I was being \ndeliberately but subtly rejected. (Jackson, 19 years)\nHomophobia is clearly a disruptive influence on SSAGQ young people’s education and there is little \ndoubt that it affects other students as well. One school principal recently remarked that he believed that \nby addressing homophobia in his school, academic performance improved (Tobias, 2004). Beyond \nprotecting the rights and safety of these young people, vital as they are, it may also motivate school \nleaders to know that there are many other benefits of dealing with homophobic abuse in their school \ncommunities.\n58 Writing Themselves in 3\nWriting Themselves in 3 59 \n9. Internet use\nThe Internet had tons of accurate information regarding sexuality, things that were neglected in my \nschooling education and household. It told me that I was not alone, and that I didn’t have to act in a certain \n(stereotypical) way, that I just need to be the person who I’ve always been. (Christopher, 18 years) \nThe internet offers information which is non-confrontational (where some may not wish to speak to \ncounselors, etc). It is a playground for ideas and personal exploration, available to masses of people. \nThe sites I have been a part of and are still  apart of, have been used to hear other people’s stories, \nget personal advice and to help others. Also, a sense of belonging is important to me in my online \ncommunities.  (Markus, 17 years)\nKey findings\n• Almost all young people had access to the internet at home.\n• The internet was important in feeling accepted, exploring sexual identity, finding others, coming \nout and feeling proud. \n• Young people who reported using the internet to explore sexual identity were more likely to be \nmale and attracted exclusively to the same sex.  \nInternet access at home\nSince the 1998 study there have been many changes in internet availability and services. Australian \nhousehold access to the internet has more than quadrupled from 16% to 72% (ABS, 2009). As this survey \nwas totally online, and knowing from previous surveys how important the internet is to SSAGQ young \npeople, we asked: do you have internet access at home? In total, 97% of young people answered yes \n(n=2997).  \nFeelings about internet sites \nI  really just come on when I’m bored, to socialise with my real life friends, I feel the same, just not as \naccepted in public or not as safe so yea... (Malcolm, 15 years)\nResearch has clearly acknowledged the importance of the internet and virtual community for SSAGQ \nyoung people as offering a safe, supportive and anonymous space to practice and explore their sexuality  \n(Driver, 2006; Harper et al., 2009; Hillier & Harrison, 2007; Hillier et al., 2004)). The internet also offers \na cultural context where SSAGQ young people learn how to be same sex attracted, and participate in \na sexually specific subculture without fear of community reprisal (Bryson, 2004).  Yet young people’s \ninternet use has been the subject of much negative publicity and community concern (Dooley et al, \n2009; McGrath, 2009). Such concerns relate to the difficulties of monitoring their online contacts and \nbehaviours and the potential for establishing relationships which cause them harm either online or \noffline. While these concerns can be seen to apply equally to SSAGQ young people, their internet use is \n60 Writing Themselves in 3\narguably a means to establishing a world where their sexuality is normalised and their concerns heard \nand addressed. So little of this is available to them offline, particularly before they come out, that the \ninternet is a lifeline for many, at least for some part of their lives.  \nTo further understand SSAGQ young people’s internet use and what sites they belong to and or visit \noften we asked what they personally got out of visiting these sites. The question was broken down \ninto nine categories which were loosely informed by McMillan & Chavis’ (1986)  four criteria for sense \nof community which includes membership, influence, integration and fulfilment of needs and shared \nemotional connections. Young people were asked to choose as many items as applied for the following \nquestion: When thinking about internet sites you belong to or visit often which of the following statements \nare true for you? The site/s are places where I…. Young people’s responses can be found below in Figure \n16.\nFigure 16. How young people felt about the internet\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nfeel accepted feel safe can find \nothers like \nme\ncan find \nfriends\nthat I trust\ncan disclose \nmy sexuality\ncan get \nhelp from \nothers\ncan help \nothers\ncan work for \nchange \naround \nhomophobia\ncan feel \nproud about \nmy sexuality\nOn the internet sites I visit, I…\n.... Reading peoples blog or social networking pages about their feelings about their own sexuality. \nReading stories about homosexuality because i had no access to any literary of visual mediums to read \nabout homosexuality as a normal practice. (Andrew, 21 years)\nIn general, young people were most likely to feel accepted, find others like themselves and feel proud of \ntheir sexuality when on the internet. Because of discrimination and homophobia these often elude them \nin their offline lives. Around half felt safe online and were able to disclose their sexuality, something that \nis not always easy to do offline. When it came to activism, almost half felt the internet was a site where \nthey could help others and around a third felt it was a place where they could work for change around \nhomophobia. The evidence is clear in supporting this when looking at Facebook (a site that was often \nmentioned as  helpful) where there are over 500 groups set up to combat homophobia, many of which \nare set up by young people. Steve and Katie are examples of this. \nWriting Themselves in 3 61 \nShare my passion for helping against homophobia and trying to meet others with this passion (Steve, 19 \nyears) and i read about how open people are and it makes me proud (Katie, 17 years)\nThese results support what we have known for some time, that the internet remains an important point \nof connection for SSAGQ young people and, anecdotally, the stories would suggest that the internet is \nmost important for younger SSAGQ people around exploration and older SSAGQ people for maintaining \nfriendships and involvement in groups and interests. \nWhich Internet sites were most helpful?\nThese days the main site I visit is Facebook, and mostly the people on there are people I know and \ntrust already, on Facebook the people I know already know about my sexuality, and anyone else doesn’t \nmatter....(Raquel, 20 years)\nIn order to find out what sites young people visited often and which were most helpful one survey item \nasked: Please tell us more about your answers including which internet sites have been most helpful and \nhow you have used them. \nThere were numerous internet sites mentioned in these two questions, Facebook was overwhelmingly the \nmost popular.  This is of no surprise as Facebook has become the number one social networking site in \nthe world with up to 500 million members. MySpace was also mentioned by some. There were various \nother sites mentioned for finding information, reading stories, chatting to others and finding out about up \nand coming events including After Ellen.com, Same Same, and Live Journal.  Australian sites were often \nmentioned including Minus 18, Freedom, Same Same and Mogenic (the site has since shut down and \nthe sadness about this was reflected in many of the comments). Pornography sites (none specified) were \nmentioned regularly as a place to find out how to have sex, to clarify attraction and to have fun.  YouTube \nwas mentioned especially as a site for watching videos of young people coming out.\nUsing the internet to explore sexual identity\nFor SSAGQ young people, forming a positive sexual identity involves clarification, exploration, \nacceptance and integration of a non-heterosexual orientation.  It includes not only making sense of \nsexual feelings, but choosing whether or not to disclose to others. Given the frequent lack of safety in \ntheir offline communities and the anonymous nature of the internet, it is not surprising that it is a central \nplace for these young people to explore their sexual identity. Young people were asked: have you used \nthe internet to explore your sexual identity?  Three-quarters (76%) of young people responded that they \nhad used the internet for this purpose.  \nThose who reported using the internet to explore sexual identity were more likely to be male, over 18, \nnon-indigenous, attracted exclusively to the same sex, and identify as gay, lesbian or homosexual.  For \n62 Writing Themselves in 3\nmany of the young people in this study, the internet played a particularly important role in exploring issues \naround sexuality and sexual identity. Jayne was typical: \nWhen i was first questioning my sexuality i was about 15 and didn’t have anybody around me who i could \ntalk things over with or question, so i joined ‘community’ groups on livejournal with like minded people... \ni posted my questions concerns and strangers from across the world, who did not know my name, face \nor hometown, but who knew me through my posts, would answer the questions and give real feedback \nwhich helped me a lot through my teenage years at high school.  I didn’t have a face to face group... the \npeople on these live journal communities were my support group and the support had a huge impact on \nme. (Jayne, 18 years)\nMany young people mentioned that the internet played an important role in seeking information, support \nand connection with similar others that was not available to them offline, particularly those not out, those \nin hostile environments, and those with little support - including those living in rural areas:  \n I have used the internet to gain a sense of belonging and pride in the gay community.  I live in a small, \nChristian town and I sometimes feel isolated and lonely.  Sites such as afterellen.com help me to \nappreciate the lighter side of gay culture and to realize that it involves fun as well as struggle. (Violet, 15 \nyears)\nive visited lesbian chat rooms and dating sites… i feel so good there… as soon as I get back to the real \nworld… its fucked all over again. (Marsha, 15 years)\nThe anonymous nature of the internet allowed these young people to be more courageous with self-\ndisclosures and to ask embarrassing questions: \nI find that the internet really allows you to be a lot more open about yourself without a big risk of backlash.  \nWhilst some people will say bad things about you, it’s a lot easier to brush off or have the confidence to \nfight back on the internet as compared to real life.  (Corey, 19 years)\nThe anonymous nature of the internet also allows young people to play with identities (Turkle, 1995), and \npractise coming out to others in a less daunting context (Hillier et al., 2001).  For Alex, coming out online \nprovided courage and confidence to come out in real life:  I read a lot of “coming-out” stories when I was \nyounger which gave me the confidence to do it myself. (Alex, 18 years)\nReasons given for not using the internet for this purpose included not needing support or information \nfor sexuality related issues, and having adequate sources of information and support in real life.  For \nexample Angel wrote: \nI’m lucky in that most things that I need to know about sexuality I can ask of my friends and family (my \nmum is bi and also a midwife/sex ed teacher and I can’t begin to explain how helpful that is!) so I don’t \nactually need to turn to the internet much. Well, at all really.  (Angel, 17 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 63 \nOthers such as Helena were reluctant to use the internet because she was not yet out to her family: I \nhave avoided using the internet at home to find sites about homosexuality simply because I don’t want it to \nshow up in the browser history. (Helena, 21 years)\nComments about negative experiences online were mentioned (and included problems with sleazy and \npromiscuous older males, but these were relatively infrequent.  \nUses of the internet for sexuality related issues\nIn respect to the specific ways that the internet helps facilitate identity development, a range of themes \nemerged.  Seeking both information and interaction, young people were able to meet a range of needs \nthat often were not met in more traditional settings.  \nSSAGQ yound people reported that they sought online information about non-heterosexual sex, sexual \nhealth issues, same sex relationships and community, and that this type of information was not always \navailable to them via more traditional channels such as family or school.   \n Have used net for “finding information about lesbian sex – I still get worries that I wont know what to do \nwith a girl if I ever get one! (Roberta, 18 years)\nFor some, the internet provided clarity around same sex attractions. Similar to young people in Hillier’s \nstudy (2001),  the internet was identified as a safe space to explore feelings, gain clarity about sexual \nattraction, and to develop a more certain sense of self-identity. \n When first evaluating my same sex attraction I explored the internet for answers to my questions…. In my \nlater teens the internet became a useful tool for establishing friendships and finding sex.  (Brian, 18 years)\nWhen I first started to think I might be gay or bisexual I used the internet a lot to find out about how I was \nfeeling and what it meant.  (Bronson, 16 years)\nA strong theme was finding others like me, and some reported the relief that they felt around connecting \nwith others who were going through similar issues.  For example, (Samantha, 16 years) wrote: My reading \nabout others who face the same issues, I feel more comfortable with who I am and less alien.  Because \nof the breadth of internet users it is easy to find similar others on the internet, which can lead to feelings \nof connectedness and community. This also makes it a safe environment to try out new identities.  Many \nyoung people indicated that they used the internet to meet others who were in similar situations, and that \nit helped to reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.  Some reported meeting up with online friends \nin real life, for friendships, relationships, and sexual experiences.  Connecting with others (often in the \nform of reading others’ blogs or stories) provided a sense of being less alone, and provided hope and \npossibility for the future: \n \n64 Writing Themselves in 3\nI read stories about other people coming out and being in relationships etc and it helps me feel more \nnormal and it gives me hope that I can have the relationship I want one day.  (Frances, 18 years)\nAnd going online to find comfort in others stories helped a lot, coming out stories etc.  Helped me realize I \ncan make my own story. (Henry, 17 years)\nThe internet allows for anonymous communication which reduces the emotional risk of disclosure to \nothers and 85% had disclosed their sexual orientation to someone online, higher than  the 73% in the \n2004 study.  Brad remembered a time in when he was only out online: \nWhen I was younger I used the internet to compartmentalize my sexuality, as the ‘gay me’ only existed \nonline. This left the real me often at a loss without the internet, and without any ‘real’ gay friends, I felt quite \nlonely. As I got older and started meeting people in real life, I became less reliant on the internet as a place \nto find acceptance. However, I’m glad I had the ability to meet people online, because back then I was \nextremely confused. (Brad, 18 years)\nYoung people also used the internet to support others in need.  For example Peggy wrote: \nI like to talk to people that are feeling the same as I do/have and I like to help others going through the \nsame thing. (Peggy, 14 years)\nThis use of the internet for supporting others was frequently extended to engaging in activism for more \ncomprehensive social change. This opportunity to fight back was the trigger for some young people to \nenter a chat room or forum to address homophobic posts. In regard to this trend, studies have shown \nthat active participation in online groups has resulted in increased self-esteem, positive sexual identity, \nand increased levels of disclosure to others (McKenna & Bargh, 1998).  \nThere is considerable concern in the community about the ready access young people have to \npornography on the internet and the degree to which they may have their view of appropriate sexual \nbehaviour shaped by it (Bryant, 2009). For SSAGQ young people who frequently live in an information \nvacuum about sexual relationships and sexual practices, it may be the only source of information. Young \npeople reported accessing sexually explicit material for a range of reasons: to help clarify their attractions, \nfor sexual education purposes, and for sexual outlet either when same sex partners were not easy to find, \nor to minimise risks associated with real life contact.\nIn regards to using the internet to explore my sexuality, porn was definitely the best thing (as embarrassing \nas it is).  It allows you to have a look at what interests you within your own comfort zone so you don’t go off \nand do something stupid in real life. (Blythe, 17 years)\nYoung women also reported accessing pornography online: \nIn relation to how I have used the internet to explore my sexual identity, I’d say porn - it helps you realise \nwhat you’re attracted to. (Becky, 15 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 65 \nBrae’s story, 15 years\nI started using the internet to explore my sexuality many, many years ago, when I realised that it was \nsomething that I needed to explore more fully and didn’t have any resources around me. Even today, the \ninternet is still my primary way of integrating and communicating with the gay community, and it has been \nthe principal force behind my acceptance, understanding and disclosure of my sexuality… I think I can \nsafely say that if it were not for the internet, I would not have been able to accept myself as gay and come \nout in the way that I have; I would still be one confused, lonely and in-denial teenager.\nSally’s story, 21 years\nI followed a lot of gay people on youtube who had gone through, or were going through the same thing \nas me, which helped define what being gay meant in my mind, erasing the stereotypes, and helped me \nrelate in a way that let me admit to myself that I am the same as these people, and they’re ok, so I must be \nokay too. I watched a lot of gay-themed feature films online, that I wouldn’t have had access too otherwise, \nand wouldn’t have been comfortable buying or renting anyway. These provided positive depictions of \ngay relationships to me, and helped me learn how gay relationships work, and differ from the norm. \nRelationships for same sex couples were never addressed throughout school, and I had no friends I could \ntalk to about this. Online forums allowed me to interact with other gay males of a similar age for the first \ntime, seek support, learn about what it meant to be gay, and once again provided an education in areas of \nsocial life, relationships, and sex-ed that simply weren’t addressed while straight relationships and issues \nwere being discussed in the classroom and the playground at school. Before I joined these forums, I had \nnever had any interaction with openly gay people. It took away the bogey-monster stereotyped image I had \nin my mind, these were just teenagers like me, normal people. Most of all the internet taught me that I was \nnot alone, and there were ways of finding people like me, even if I couldn’t spot them, they were there. \n  \n66 Writing Themselves in 3\nWriting Themselves in 3 67 \n10. Disclosure and  \n  support\nI’m a HSC student just trying to live my life. Being in the closet nearly killed me and I know it has killed \nothers. I hope to study law next year. Since coming out none of the closeted girls want to date me but \nbeing open and honest is good for the soul. (Diana, 17 years)\nAfter a rocky and confusing start being a practising Christian and realising I was a lesbian, I now feel happy \nand proud of my sexuality. I found telling friends harder than telling family at first - I always knew my family \nwould be ok (I have an aunt who is a lesbian, so I wasn’t the first) but I thought straight female friends \nwould be ‘freaked out’. In the end those friends were supportive. After leaving school I moved to Sydney \nand now have a wider circle of friends many of whom are queer. I live in a house-share with other queer \nwomen and am contemplating moving in with my gorgeous girlfriend that I’ve been with for 7 months. life \nis great! . (Bettina, 21 years) \nKey findings\n• 97.5% of young people had disclosed their same sex attractions to at least one person, a \ncontinuing trend to openness from 2004 (95%) and 1998 (82%). \n• Support from almost everyone was higher in 2010 than in previous studies.\n• Friends continue to be the most popular choice as confidantes for young people disclosing \ntheir sexual feelings.  \n• In general, young men were more likely to disclose, and more likely to be supported compared \nto young women.  \nOver the last 12 years in Australia we have seen a trend towards visibility and disclosure of young people \nin their families and communities. From early Writing Themselves In surveys and overseas research \n(Savin-Williams, 2005), we know that young people are coming out at an increasingly early age.  This \nmay in part be because of the greater visibility of gay issues and characters in the media, the increasing  \nprofile of gay men and lesbians in society generally, the changing of laws in Australia and improved \npolicies in education and health. \nYoung people were asked: Have you told the people below about your feelings of being attracted to \npeople of your own sex? How supportive were they?  A list of 17 possible confidantes was provided, with \nthree potential responses:  no, haven’t told, yes and was supportive, or yes but was NOT supportive.  \nResponses were grouped into three categories based on relationship type - family, peers, and \nprofessionals.  \n68 Writing Themselves in 3\nDespite the trend towards openness there remained in the 2010 sample, around 75 young people who \nhad not shared their secret with anyone and who as a consequence received no support.  As is obvious \nfrom Thom below, the burden of the secret can be quite overwhelming for young people: \nI still haven’t told anyone yet, it is only me who knows of my homosexuality, which bothers me a bit… \nI haven’t told anyone yet, but with myself am far more comfortable, and am seriously contemplating \ntelling my closest friend… I am very apprehensive about coming out to my family and friends, especially \nbecause I live in a regional area, in a town of 38000 people (which I suppose is relatively urban but... \nnot) and because my school is part of the Anglican Church, and as it appears to me (due to quite a few \nhomophobic jokes made by the chaplain) the school by way of the church is against homosexuality. I don’t \nreally want very many people to find out because I don’t get along with any of the rugby boys and machos \nanyway being “straight” - Imagine the crap I’d get if they knew I was gay. I really don’t know what to do, but \nwould really like to share this with someone. (Thom, 16 years)\nLong before they come out, these young people listen to what is said and in many ways soak up \nnegativity long before it is directed at them. In the following young man’s case, homophobia alienated \nhim and caused anxiety. The closet is not necessarily a safe place for many SSAGQ young people.\nI feel i have always known that i was gay. When i was really young, i knew that i was gay, but i was \nscared. I picked up things from what people have said, and what was shown on tv. Little things like talk \nof playschool being changed because some critics said it encouraged children to be homosexual, or \nthe tellytubbies being cancelled because Po was gay. These things sounded ridiculous to get worked up \nover, and it made me scared of how people would react to me if they reacted this badly over something so \nsmall. It made me feel alone (James, 17 years)\nDisclosure to family \nWe know from previous research that telling parents is a traumatic event for young people because \nso much rests on these child-parent relationships (Hillier, 2001). Young people stand to lose not only \nemotional support, but also the resources that sustain them in their daily lives. Telling parents is one of \nthe most difficult disclosures and the secret is often kept under very difficult circumstances; for example, \nin the following two cases when a homophobic assault caused physical injury and a young person was \nleft to explain it to his/her parents:\nI was hit by three guys at school one day; one held me while the second punched me in the stomach \nonce, then the third kicked me when i was on the ground. They then forced me to suck their penises. They \ntold me if i said anything about it they would come back and do this again till i learnt not to “open my cock- \nsucking mouth”. I was so ashamed to tell my parents that i told them they beat me up to take some money. \n(Carl, 19 years)\nI had a glass bottle broken on my head whilst in Hyde Park very late one night when I was 13. I didn’t \ngo to the hospital to avoid my parents finding out. I now have a scar leading out from my hairline on my \nforehead. (Melinda, 18 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 69 \nCompared to 2004, there was an increase in the percentage of young people disclosing their sexuality to \nfamily members and an increase in the support they were given. Merida is an example:\n i was very lucky to grow up in a family where being gay was a non issue, i didn’t even feel the need to \ncome out to my parents, i introduced my first girlfriend to them when i was 15 and they were aware and \nsupportive from there on. One of the best time this year was marching with my mum in the equal love \nprotests. i value this support so much because i realise that it is very difficult and sometimes impossible to \nreconcile your family and sexuality for some people.  (Merida, 21 years)\nWhile the majority of young people reported support from the parents they had disclosed to, there \nremained a significant percentage of young people who were not supported. Research tells us that \nSSAGQ young people are over represented in homeless populations (Hillier et al.,1997; Rossiter et al., \n2003).  In some instances, parents were so distressed or angered by their child’s disclosure that this led \nto the young person leaving home.  Missy felt unsafe at home:\nI have generally been quiet about it, although when I came out, I received both a lot of hate and a lot of \nlove and acceptance. I have been called faggot, lesso, retarded, miscreant, and my mother has told me \nthat she doesn’t want me. (Missy, 14 years)\nFigure 17.

Monica was particularly concerned about telling her parents.\nIt isn’t something I would choose if I could help it. My parents would not be accepting in the slightest if \nthey knew this, and of course I have had conflict with my faith- being Christian. Though I have come to \nterms with this and believe I can be bisexual and Christian I do sometimes doubt myself and I’m not open \nabout it with most people. (Monica, 18 years)\n70 Writing Themselves in 3\nDisclosure to friends and peers\nOne of the people i thought i could trust was disgusted with me when i came out to him. He would say \nthings like “your a disgusting little fuck, faggot go kill yourself, do the world a favour” and also “theres no \nplace in the world for people like you”. (Cadell, 16 years) \nAs in previous reports, friends, more than anyone, were the first confidantes for SSAGQ young people \nand their friends were overwhelmingly supportive – the excerpt above was clearly an exception.  \nFigure 18.

As with family and friends, support from \nprofessionals was also higher in this study.\nFigure 19.

Schools are beginning to address homophobia with at least one \nstate education department releasing a specific policy with clear guidelines for school communities in \ndealing with homophobia and supporting sexual diversity3. However it took many years to produce the \nvehemence of homophobia in our culture today and it will probably take many more years to fully remove \nit. In the mean time we need to find a way forward to help buffer young people from its negative impacts. \n3  The DEECD, Victoria released Supporting Sexual Diversity in Schools to all school principals in 2008. It directs teachers \nand others to provide an inclusive curriculum and to address homophobia when and wherever it appears.\n72 Writing Themselves in 3\nWriting Themselves in 3 73 \n11. Support as a buffer \n  against negative health     \n  outcomes of homophobia\nI have not been physically abused because it is against the rules at our school to hit people. It is more \nlikely that if I went to another school I would risk being beaten up. (Nora, 15 years)\nKey Findings\n• Rejection following disclosure was associated with higher rates of self harm and suicide \nattempts in these young people.\n• Knowledge that their school had policies that protected them from homophobia, meant that \nyoung people who suffered no abuse, were less likely to self harm and attempt suicide.\n• Young people who attended a school that was supportive, rather than homophobic, were less \nlikely to self harm and attempt suicide. \nThe Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth, 1999) has identified three key determinants \nof positive mental health which were subsequently adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO, \n2004). These are social inclusion, freedom from discrimination and violence, and economic participation. \nSSAGQ young people are significantly challenged around each of these including the economic \ndisadvantage that comes with rejection by family or dropping out of school. The VicHealth framework \nfor Mental Health Promotion sees supportive relationships as a key area for action if negative mental \nhealth outcomes are to be prevented. The close relationships with family and friendship groups which \nnourish other young people who experience alienation because of ethnicity, body size or disability, for \nexample, are not readily accessed by SSAGQ young people.  When high rates of homophobic abuse are \nexperienced by young people in school and the community, supportive relationships become even more \ncritical. \nBecause of this we were interested in the buffers against this damage to mental health provided by \npeople to whom a disclosure was made and who were supportive. What difference does it make \nto a young person’s wellbeing if people are supportive of them when they disclose? What are the \nconsequences for a young person when a trusted confidante is dismissive or rejecting?\nTo ascertain whether support of a range of different people was associated with better outcomes \nregarding self harm and suicide, despite abuse, we explored young people’s reports of self harm and \nsuicide attempts by support and rejection.  We will look at these findings for family, friends and peers and \nprofessionals. \n74 Writing Themselves in 3\nWe learned from the findings in Chapter 8  that homophobic abuse is significantly linked with a range \nof negative health indicators including; feeling unsafe, drug use, self harm ideation, self harm, suicidal \nideation and suicide attempts. We examined young peoples’ rates of self harm and suicide attempts \nwhen they had support and when they were not supported. Below we discuss the links between rejection \nby family members, friends and professionals and self harm and suicide attempts. In some cases cell \nnumbers were too small to be reliable and so we have chosen the most robust analyses to report here. \nThese are family support and rejection and their links to self harm and suicide attempts and then, taking \nthe group that suffered homophobic physical assaults, we have looked at disclosures to all three groups \n(family, friends and professionals) and the different rates of self harm and suicide according to whether \nthey received support or not.\nThe support of a family member was linked to lower rates of self harm and lower rates of suicide \nattempts, regardless of what level of abuse young people experienced.  From Figure 20 it can be seen \nthat rates of self harm are higher in SSAGQ young people who are not supported when they disclose to \nmother, dad, brother or sister.\nFigure 20. Rates of self harm in young people when supported or rejected by family\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nMum Dad Brother Sister Mum Dad Brother Sister Mum Dad Brother Sister\nYoung people who report 'no abuse' Young people who report 'verbal abuse \nonly'\nYoung people who report 'physical abuse'\nSelf-harm when NOT supported\nSelf harm when supported\nSimilarly Figure 21 below shows the higher rates of suicide attempts in young people who are not \nsupported by family members, whether it is mother, father, sister or brother. What is also clear is that \nthese rates of self harm and suicide increase, regardless of support according to the level of homophobic \nabuse that young people experience. These are salutary findings for families, in particular parents, who \nlater regret not giving their SSA and GQ children support when they disclosed to them. It also shows the \nimportance of parental education where issues of same sex attraction and gender identity are concerned.\nWriting Themselves in 3 75 \nFigure 21. Rates of attempted suicide in young people when supported or rejected by family\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nMother Father Brother Sister Mother Father Brother Sister Mother Father Brother Sister\nYoung people who report 'no abuse' Young people who report 'verbal abuse \nonly'\nYoung people who report 'physical abuse'\nSuicide attempts when NOT supported\nSuicide attempts when supported\nIn summary these data demonstrate that parental rejection of a child’s sexuality is associated with \nhigher rates of suicide attempts and to a lesser extent, self harm. Conversely, family members who are \nsupportive of their children when they disclose, are less likely to have their child or sibling engage in \nself harm or suicidal behaviours. These findings are incredibly important in developing a way forward to \nimproved mental health for SSAGQ youth. Consistently through these data we have found examples of \nhappy, well adjusted young people, despite abuse, who are unconditionally supported and loved by their \nfamilies. Minika was one of them:\nI feel as though i have been very fortunate in my life. My family at home, extended family and friends have \nalways been 100% supportive and i don’t feel as though my life would be very different (apart from in the \nobvious ways) if i was living a heterosexual lifestyle. Although my own experience has been one that many \nwish for, i know this is not the case and i feel no hesitation in ensuring that same sex attracted young \npeople have the courage as well as the access to support groups if necessary (Minika, 21 years)\nCommunity education, which prepares parents for a possible revelation of this kind, and the identification \nof some clear sources of ongoing support for parents are legitimate and necessary mental health \ninitiatives.\nBelow in Figures 22 and 23 we have taken the group of young people who suffered physical assault and \ncompared their rates of self harm and suicide according to whether they were supported or rejected by \nfamily, friends and professionals. \n76 Writing Themselves in 3\nFigure 22. Rates of self harm in young people who had been assaulted when supported or rejected\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100% Young people who report 'physical abuse'\nSelf-harm when NOT supported\nSelf harm when supported\nIn all cases, rates of suicide and self harm are lower if young people received support when they \ndisclosed. Everyone has the potential to influence this when they support or reject a young person who \ncomes out to them.\nFigure 23.

Sadly we know from the data on place of abuse, that schools seldom play \nsuch a role. However, in the face of high rates of violence found in previous surveys many schools around \nAustralia are taking measures to address the issue and these efforts are having an impact.\nYoung people were asked two questions in particular about school support, first whether their school \nhad policies that protected them against homophobic abuse and second whether their school was \nhomophobic, neutral or supportive of diverse sexualities. We carried out the same analyses as before \nwith the three independent abuse groups to ascertain rates of self harm and suicide in schools with, \nand without, policies and with supportive or homophobic school climates.  Those who were aware that \ntheir school had policies to protect them were less likely to attempt suicide if they had not suffered \nabuse (7% v 15%), however for those who had suffered homophobic abuse, school policies had little or \nno connection to self harm and suicide. It stands to reason that protective policies that exist but do not \nprotect SSAGQ youth from homophobic abuse are ineffective in reducing rates of self harm and suicide.\nIn regard to school environment, young people who reported their school as being supportive were less \nlikely to harm themselves or attempt suicide regardless of whether they experienced abuse. These data \nabout self harm and suicide in relation to school policy and environment indicate that school policies \nthat are not put into practice are far less effective in engendering mental health in SSAGQ students than \nschools which show by their actions that they are supportive of these young people.\nWe know that rates of self harm and suicide in SSAGQ young people in Australia are high and these rates \nare significantly linked to homophobic abuse. Reducing rates of community homophobia is an important \nresponsibility and imperative if we are to reverse this situation. However, in the mean time we have \nfound that support of family, friends and, to a lesser extent, professionals can ameliorate the destructive \nimpacts of homophobia. As well, schools play an important role in the mental health of their students. If \nthey do nothing, they will exacerbate mental ill health in their SSAGQ students by allowing homophobia \nto flourish. On the other hand, if they develop policies that protect students, advertise them to the school \ncommunity, and put them into practice by supporting sexual diversity, they will improve the mental health \nof their SSAGQ students. No longer can schools argue that ‘letting things be’ is a better option because \n‘letting things be’ is likely to mean that SSAGQ students’ rates of self harm and suicide attempts will \nincrease. No school would want to have this as a legacy of its work. \n78 Writing Themselves in 3\nWriting Themselves in 3 79 \n12.

(Gabby, 14 years)\nKey findings\n• A quarter of young people attended a school where they knew there was policy-based \nprotection from homophobia and discrimination.\n• 10% of young people reported that their school did not provide any form of Sexuality Education \nat all.\n• 40%  attended a school with no social or structural support features for sexual difference.\n• Only 19% of young people attended a school that was supportive of their sexuality.\n• Over a third described their school as homophobic. \n• The internet was the most important source of information about homophobia and \ndiscrimination, gay and lesbian relationships and gay and lesbian safe sex.\nSince the advent of HIV/AIDS it is generally accepted in Australia that the community has a responsibility \nto provide information about safe sex and relationships to young people. This responsibility is not \nconsistently attributed to any single source – parents, school and other bodies can be implicated. The \noriginal Writing Themselves In (1998) found that the family and the school largely confined information \nprovision to heterosexual safe sex and relationships. This left young people who had same sex \nencounters with little information about the prevention of sexually transmissible infections (STIs) or \nconception and pregnancy. Young people were asked if they had received any useful information about \nthe topics below from these sources with the options of school, media, gay media, internet, heterosexual \nfriends, SSA friends, family and gay community (see Appendix 1). \n80 Writing Themselves in 3\nSources of information about homophobia and discrimination\nAccess to information about homophobia and discrimination can assist young people in reframing \nnegative messages about sexual difference and decrease discriminatory attitudes and homophobic \nbehaviour among young people who are opposite sex attracted. It can also allow same sex attracted \nyoung people to move from the assumption that there is something wrong with their sexuality to an \nunderstanding that the problem is the reception and treatment of that sexuality within social culture. \nFigure 24.

Most sourced it from the internet, friends and community (see Figure 24). It is difficult to \nexplain the decrease in access to homophobia and discrimination information from all potential sources \nsince the 2004 study. \nWriting Themselves in 3 81 \nSources of information about relationships\nAlmost a fifth of young people were able to access information about gay or lesbian relationships from \nschool. The internet was their major source and gay community provided information to about half.\n \nFigure 25.

The religious group were the least likely to get this information \nfrom school and were more likely to source it from the internet than other participants suggesting their \ngreater need to supplement such information.\nThere has been no significant development in the provision of information on gay or lesbian relationships \nor safe sex since 1998.\nFigure 26.

Only 25% \nreported in the affirmative leaving 75% of young people in the study who did not enjoy the certainty of \npolicy-based protection at school. The GQ group was more likely to report that their school did not have \nthis policy as were students in the religious group. \nA variety of strong associations suggest policy-based protection makes a difference to SSAGQ students \nin many areas. Firstly, comparative data suggests that perceived policy-based protection has correlations \nwith these students’ rates of self harm and suicide (this issue is discussed more fully in Chapter 11). \nSecondly, the data indicate that perceived policy-based protection may improve SSAGQ students’ \nfeelings of safety at school. Indeed, 75% of SSAY who were aware of policy-based protection against \nhomophobia at school felt safe there, compared to 46% who said their school had no policy and 64% \nWriting Themselves in 3 83 \nwho didn’t know. Thus, protective policy could be a contributing factor to SSAGQ young people feeling \nsafe at school.\nThirdly, perceived policy-based protection has correlations with students’ feelings about their sexuality. \nOverall, 85% of young people who were aware of policy-based protection against homophobia at school \nfelt good about their sexuality compared to 78% who said their school had no policy and 76% who didn’t \nknow. The evidence suggests policy-based protections against homophobia at school could be an \ninfluence on factors leading to mental health in SSAGQ young people. \nSexuality Education classes and lessons\nAn item in the survey asked young people to indicate which messages, out of a total of 13 they had been \ntaught in Sexuality Education   Most Australian students are exposed to a very particular combination of \nmessages in their Sexuality Education. \nFigure 27. Content of Sexuality Education\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nMessages from sex-education classes \n(n = 3133)\nAccording to the young people in this study the three strongest messages coming through in their \nSexuality Education were about how the body changes at puberty (88%), how humans mate and \nreproduce (85%)  and about protecting against sexual dangers (STDs, pregnancy (85%). Because the \nresearch has demonstrated that schools are more likely to be sources of information on heterosexual \nsafe sex and relationships than other types, it is likely that gay and lesbian sex, relationships and \nreproductive possibilities are being overlooked in these messages. From these findings it is clear that \nquite conservative messages emphasizing heterosexual sex and danger are the norm in most Australian \nschools with a far smaller number providing critical messages inclusive of SSAGQ youth. \nYoung people in the religious group were taught the most conservative messages. \n84 Writing Themselves in 3\nUsefulness of Sexuality Education\nYong people were asked how useful their Sexuality Education was and why. There were 2392 written \nresponses to this question and a sample of 200 responses were analysed in detail. Of this sample, 44% \nfound their Sexuality Education not useful at all, 40% felt it was only partly useful, 11% found it moderately \nuseful and 5% found this Sexuality Education very useful. This was loosely comparable to 2004 data on \nusefulness of Sexuality Education, however, in 2010 a slightly higher percentage found their Sexuality \nEducation useless, and a lower percentage found it very useful. \nPerhaps the key feature of the 2010 data overall, which was reflected in the sample, was young people’s \ncritique of the way their Sexuality Education had a chiefly heterosexual focus and largely overlooked any \nkind of information around same sex attraction. Indeed, 44% of the written responses across the sample \nused for this report made some direct reference to this issue. For example, Mini (20 years) commented, \nthey didn’t mention anything about gay sex. just hetro sex. Eva described her Sexuality Education as not \nvery useful because of this limitation: \nwhen talking about SSA same sex there was one sentence - Homosexuals exist and form sexual \nrelationships. Now when a man and a woman...  I never even knew a dental dam existed until i found a \nlocal Gay Youth Group. (Eva, 19 years) \nRoss also found his classes a poor guide, arguing: \n if sex ed classes were the only influence on me, I’d probably be completely paranoid. Non-heterosexual \nrelationships were really just glossed over. (Ross, 15 years)\nAnother recurrent theme in the young people’s comments was their initiative and determination to \nget information for themselves when it was not provided by the traditional sources of school or family. \nThere were several students who used self-education as a means of overcoming the homophobia in \nthe curriculum or specific gaps around same sex attraction or transgender issues. For example, on the \nquestion of usefulness, Kristen responded: \nFor me, not at all. I spose at the time it was relevant as it was in my first year of two of high school which is \nwhen i was still identifying as heterosexual. The fact that the school failed to address issues for SSA people \njust meant that i was unaware of sexual issues later on and had to do my own research.  (Kristen, 21 years)\nRichard (21 years) described his school’s Sexuality Education as: Moderately useful, but less useful than \ninternet or self education. A lack of information on lesbian safe sex in particular was noted by young \nwomen who had to seek out other sources. Lindsay reflected: \nI think gay sex was mentioned once in 6 years (if that), and lesbian sex never. In the end I had to ask my \ndoctor for information on lesbian safe-sex. (Lindsay, 18 years) \nWriting Themselves in 3 85 \nWhile it is heartening that these young people took responsibility for their sexual lives and were actively \nresearching the information they needed, it seems that schools are missing the opportunity to meet the \nneeds of all their students and provide equitable sexual health outcomes.  \nAnother theme was that classes on this topic often came too late. This description was sometimes \napplied to its positioning within more senior year level curricula, and sometimes related more specifically \nto individual’s or group’s pre-exposure to sexual knowledge or pre-engagement in sexual activities. \nIt was too late. I already knew this stuff when they were teaching me in high school. They did make us \nfamiliar with the anatomical words when we were much younger.. but I really didn’t feel like the lessons \nwere practical when we were 15/16.. There needs to be more information on S.T.I’s, U.T.I’s.. they really \nneed to assume the worst: WE HAVE ALREADY HAD SEX... A FEW TIMES... (hiss, boo!) :P  and therefore \nprovide information surrounding that.. assuming we already know what penetrative sex is and where it all \ngoes...! (Paris, 19 years)\nAmongst the responses that ranked Sexuality Education efforts at certain schools as not useful, there \nwere also some responses describing these classes as being actively harmful. Several young people \ndescribed the classes as promoting homophobia, or as presenting perspectives in which homosexuality \nis framed as evil or dangerous. Carmen complained: \nReligious Education involved speeches about how premarital sex is wrong, and how same sex parents \ncould never raise a child well. It was pretty disgusting, and made me angry. (Carmen, 20 years)\nThere were cases where the damage was the spread of other types of misinformation:\nStudents were also told that condoms bore no protection against STIs In some cases teachers who were \nvirgins were talking to sexually active students about sex and pregnancy (Royce, 6 years). \nThere were also cases where a damaging sense of homosexual abnormality was created in the class by \nvirtue of poor or disengaged teaching: \nGoing through three terms of sex ed without homosexuality being mentioned was pretty awful. In one class \nthe teacher set up an anonymous question box, so I put in “I’m gay. How is this class relevant to me?” \nWhen the teacher pulled it out of the box she said “Oh, that’s just a silly question.” and threw it out. So it \nwas pretty much a daily class of ‘you are not normal’. (Dianne, 21 years). \nWhile it is inspiring to see these young people resist negative rhetoric and clearly identify the negativity \nto which they have been exposed, there would certainly be students with less confidence who may \nexperience severe consequences. On the other hand, there were some schools that had programs and \nschool-wide approaches that young people were very positive about. In analysing the Sexuality Education \nthat earned the description of being very useful in the descriptions given by young people, it was clear \nthat quality provision has some distinguishing features:\n86 Writing Themselves in 3\nSexuality Education that combined a large variety of positive messages, for example, Blair enthused IT \nwas amazing my teacher went through everything systematically. (21 years)\nCritical thinking and exposure to more fluid constructions of sexuality were appreciated by young people. \nPerry reflected:\nIt has broadened the minds of my peers and myself to understand the fluidity of sexual feelings and sexual \nidentities and opened them up to accepting the LGBT peers of my year. (Perry, 17 years)\nWide-reaching inclusion of same sex attraction and sexual diversity beyond token inclusion attempts \nwere also useful:\nMy school has really good sexual education - it’s been good. We spend approximately 6 weeks of sex ed \nclasses in year 10 exclusively talking about same sex attraction” (Corinne, 17 years).\nAnti-discrimination and anti-homophobia efforts were valued, for example, Rowena described her \nSexuality Education as good because it doesnt discriminate against anyone. it was open minded. \n(Rowena, 20 years) and Sexuality Education that changed the social dynamic at school so that people \nbecame more understanding and supportive was important: Very helpful. Other people better understood \nsome things I may be experiencing. Understanding through education is really helpful. (Nathan, 19 years)\nTeachers who went into detail, were supportive and used diverse resources inspired Samson:\n \nI felt that the health education classes we had at school really guided me towards my current degree and \ncareer choice. It was also in depth and engaging, taught by an excellent teacher who had some excellent \nguest speakers come talk to us about specific things. (Samson, 20 years)\nAlso included as useful were supportive peers and moments of social affirmation. Tobias described these \nclasses “mega useful!”\nWe had this thing called the “secret box” or something with an equally silly name, where we could write \nquestions for the teacher or for the class as a whole to discuss. I put in several questions around gay \nissues, including the one that meant the most to me “How would you feel if a close friend came out \nto you?”. The responses I heard to these questions anonymously were great and made me feel more \ncomfortable about coming out. (Tobias, 20 years)\nThese findings reflect that while there may presently be some barriers to overcome, it is certainly possible \nfor schools to implement broad-ranging, inclusive and challenging Sexuality Education that meets the \nneeds of SSAGQ youth and creates a more positive school culture for all students. \nWriting Themselves in 3 87 \nSupport features of schools\nYoung people were asked to report on the support features that existed in their schools (see Figure \n28 below). The most common response was none of the features listed. Overall, none of the support \nfeatures listed is standard in Australian schools, but most participants (60%) attended a school with at \nleast one or more of them and this is pleasing to see. \nFigure 28. Support features in school  \n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nSupport features in school\n(n = 3133)\nStudents identified as having religious backgrounds were less likely to report a range of features as \nwere GQ young people. All students could benefit from more sexual diversity supports at school and a \nfriendlier school climate, particularly the more isolated religious and gender diverse SSAY.\nThe School Culture in General\nYoung people were asked to rank their school overall on a scale from Very Homophobic to Very \nSupportive. Most classified their school as Neutral (44%), with 27% classifying their school as \nHomophobic and 14% Supportive. At the extremes of the scale, 9% classed their school as Very \nHomophobic and 5% as Very Supportive. Young people who mentioned religious discourse were also \nmore likely to rank their school as Very Homophobic.\nThere were also associations between a school’s rating in terms of supportiveness and how SSA \nstudents felt about their sexuality. Overall, 87% of students who ranked their school as supportive felt \ngood or great, compared to 75% at a homophobic school and 78% at a neutral school. Thus, we have an \nimportant and clearly emerging picture of the importance of addressing homophobia in the school culture \nin order to improve the mental health and wellbeing of SSAGQ students.\n88 Writing Themselves in 3\nWhat young people want from school\nIn the past we have used research findings to deduce what SSAGQ young people need from their \nschools based on their reported experiences. This has been useful information a catalyst for the \ndevelopment of some Australian policies, training programs and resources in the field. In this survey \nwe asked the question specifically by getting participants to respond to the open-ended question My \nschool could better support my sexuality by…. There were 1949 written responses and a sample of 200 \nresponses were analysed in detail. The strongest theme (appearing in 40% of responses) was that young \npeople wanted Sexuality Education to be more inclusive of same sex attraction and gender diversity. \nVictoria (15 years) was part of this group who typically wanted schools to support her sexuality by helping \nmore with it and educating people more. Samara (15 years) specifically wanted her school to be Teaching \nthat homophobia is wrong and shouldn’t be tolerated. Hamish wanted earlier educational interventions in \nthis field: \nIncluding sexual diversity in the sex ed courses and put SSA information around alot so that it becomes \nneutral in the kids mind and they do not hate later on and just accept  that there are SSA because they \nhave been neutralised. (Hamish, 18 years)\nChloe also wanted this education to include: \nTeaching that there is diversity in family structure. Learning about gender fluidity and sexual fluidity. \nTeaching same sex safe sex techniques...however this is a long shot considering lesbian Sexuality \nEducation does not even feature within the queer community. (Chloe, 20 years)\nMarisa suggested schools should stop: having such a heteronormative curriculum in the first place which \nis implicitly in its self homophobic as it does not address any other types of sexuality or gender issues. \n(Marisa, 21 years)\nThe second strongest theme within the sample (reflected in 27% of responses) was that young people \nwanted their school to simply discuss same sex attraction and/or gender diversity.  Ian, who described \nhis school as very homophobic, called for whole-school announcements to be made on the issue \namongst other approaches:\nwell i dropped out of school for these reasons but they could make announcements, teach about \nawareness and have rules put in place to protect from discrimination. (Ian,15 years)\nJock spoke of a lack of acknowledgment of homosexuality at his all-boys school that may contribute to a \nlack of understanding: \nI think the best way for them to support my sexuality is to actually acknowledge it rather than pretend that \nit is nonexistent. I know there are a number of boys out there who have got no idea whatsoever about \nhomosexuality and such. (Jock, 20 years)\nWithin the sample, 19% of students described special needs for same sex attracted and gender diverse \nyouth that could be recognised or met by the school. These included the need for social groups or gay-\nWriting Themselves in 3 89 \nstraight-alliances (GSAs), information, support workers or (non-homophobic) counselling staff, referrals \nto services or external support groups. Regina (18 years) felt that her school should start acknowledging \n… that some same sex orientated students may need more emotional and mental health help. Brenton \nbelieved such support or services also needed to be promoted: \nOpenly offering help.  I’m sure some of the staff would have offered help if it was sought after, but there \nis no advertisement of said help.  The culture of the students is quite homophobic in general as well. \n(Benton, 19 years)\nAn additional 12% wanted their school to simply become aware that same sex attracted or gender \ndiverse people exist and form part of the school community.  For example, Eva felt her school could \nbetter support her sexuality by: \nNot glossing over the fact that there are SSA young people in ALL schools. By the time i graduated year 12 \nthere was 8 openly gay people in my year level. While most of the teachers were fantastic, some ignored \nhomophobic bullying in front of their eyes, and a few even perpetrated it. (Eva, 19 years)\nVanessa (20 years) wanted an end to homophobic gossip amongst students and staff, calling for people \nto start acting slightly more responsible about it, the teachers at my school seemed as gossip-interested \nas the students. Fred also decried homophobia that was perpetuated by people rather than school \nstructures as such:\nMy school was not against homosexuals however some teachers were homophobic and showed it and \nthere was not nearly enough homosexual support. (Fred, 18 years)\nA further 11% called for schools to enforce disciplinary procedures that punish homophobic verbal \nabuse, physical abuse and other types of bullying. \nThere was evidence of students describing their own attempts at actively pursuing their schooling ideals. \nIn some cases these students were very successful at developing their schools and achieving their vision. \nGina, for example, who described her current school as very supportive, reported how she brought \nchange to this school after experiencing support at another; the government school was spot on! Perfect \nthe christian school had no programs or support of any kind when i attended, but partly due to my urging \nthey do now. (Gina, 17 years) Gillian, who described her school as homophobic, had plans to engage in \nactive efforts to better conditions: \nNext year I will be attempting to create a GSA to promote understanding. They could ban our religious \nteachers from telling us their opinion on homosexuality and introduce more homosexual/transgender \ninformation in health classes. (Gillian, 15 year)\nAll schools in Australia have students who are same sex attracted or gender questioning and need to \nbe considered by them if their educational outcomes are to be equal. They should be included within \nSexuality Education so that they do not need to rely on the internet and other sources to supplement \n90 Writing Themselves in 3\nthe deficiencies in their school-based Sexuality Education.  They are also directly calling for a range of \nstructural and social support features to be put in place at their schools. With a correlation between the \nexistence of policy-based protection against homophobia at the SSA students’ schools and positive \noutcomes for the students in the areas of self harm, suicide, feelings of safety and positive feelings \nabout their sexuality, these data strongly support further development, promotion and implementation of \neducation policy in this area. Schools can make a big difference to young lives  if they aim at becoming \n“very supportive” towards SSAY, putting several social and structural support features in place, actively \npromoting and implementing anti-homophobia policies, and improving the content and messages of their \nSexuality Education for all students.\nThis survey has made me think a bit more about my schooling. I would never have come out openly at \nschool. It wasn’t ever a part of the life. There was no sexual diversity. A past captain came out as gay. Best \nthing ever. (Clare, 20 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 91 \n13. Multiple layers of  \n  influence\nReligion\nSome days the whole issue of homosexuality makes me feel depressed, alone and confused. I’ve been to \nthe point where I’ve felt like it needs to end, that I shouldn’t have to suffer like this. But there are two things \nthat always have gotten me through the tough times. These are: 1 I would cause a lot of harm in my family. \nAnd 2 that God does not give a man more then he can handle. Therefore what ever comes my way, God \nwill get me through it. (Daniel, 20 years)\nKey Findings\nThose who mentioned religion (n=267) were:\n• More likely to feel bad about their same sex attraction.\n• More likely to have experienced social exclusion or had to tolerate homophobic language from \nfriends.\n• More likely to report homophobic abuse in the home.\n• More likely to report feeling unsafe at home.\n• More likely to not be supported by their mother, father, brother, teacher or student welfare \ncoordinator/counsellor, when disclosing their SSA.\n• More likely to report thoughts of self harm and suicide or to carry out self harm.\nDespite the gradual liberalization of some religious denominations and increasing social change within \nAustralian society, religion is still correlating negatively with the health and wellbeing of SSAGQ young \npeople. Although we did not ask any question regarding religion, a significant number of young people \nmentioned religious discourse within their qualitative responses. For the purpose of analysis, those who \nused religious discourse of any sort were classified as ‘religious’ and the rest as ‘not religious’, although \nwe appreciate that many young people so classified may indeed be religious.  The critical element for \nus was whether or not they used religion in their discourses to describe their journey, or to tell their story, \nas we reasoned that those who did, saw religion as an important issue. While Christianity was the major \nreligion specifically mentioned in these data, many participants just referred to religion which may not \nhave always been Christianity. Young people most frequently mentioned religion when responding to the \nquestions on self harm and feelings about their sexuality. A conflict between same sex attraction and \nreligion occurred frequently in regard to family, friends, school, and an internal conflict with their own \npersonal faith.\nWhile some churches in Australia have shed themselves of homophobic beliefs and now include LGBT \npeople in all aspects of church life, others remain steadfast to their traditions and are increasingly out \n92 Writing Themselves in 3\nof step with both science and Australian law. Homosexuality has not been considered a mental illness \nfor some time, nor has it been a crime anywhere in Australia for thirteen years. Recent changes to \nAustralia federal law saw same sex partners recognized as de-facto spouses, and same sex marriage \nhas increasingly become legal around the world. Nevertheless, some SSAGQ young people who are \ninvolved in religion in Australia are often forced to negotiate their sexuality within the confines of a belief \nsystem that threatens an eternity in ‘hell’ for the feelings they experience as unavoidable. SSAGQ young \npeople who accept their sexuality often face condemnation from their family and friends as well as from \ntheir religious community and may experience increased isolation and shame in the very places that are \nsupposed to be supportive and safe: their school, church and home. \n \nFeelings about sexuality\nOur study showed that compared to those who did not mention religion, those who did, were less likely to \nfeel good (67% v 80%), and more likely to feel bad (8% v 3%) about their same sex attraction. Like many \nSSAGQ young people who mentioned religion, Oscar tried desperately to change his sexuality but found \nhimself in an impossible situation, becoming depressed and alienated, leaving him with no other option \nbut to renounce his faith, all before the age of 14:\nI kept on telling myself that homosexuality was immoral and wrong, and I prayed and told myself that I liked \npeople of the opposite sex. This caused me a great deal of depression and alienation from my peers…\nBeing a Christian made me hate myself and who I was, and I really believed that God could change me. \nBy the time I hit puberty I had renounced my faith and accepted myself for who I was. (Oscar, 14 years)\nJoshua had a similar response when asked how he felt about his same sex attraction:\nWhen I was a religious person I thought it was horrible and spent two years trying to ‘cure’ myself to no \navail, which led me into deep depression. (Joshua, 16 years)\nIsolation and support\nThe stories of SSAGQ young people who experience religion are those of young people on a difficult \njourney. Some have only experienced life within the church, where their friends, family, education and \nsocial life are all a part of their religion. When they begin to question their sexuality these young people \noften discover that they are alone and begin to fear their religious world as much as they have been \nbrought up to fear the wider secular one. SSAGQ young people who experience religion are often left to \nunderstand their sexuality alone with little, if any, information to help them. \nOur study discovered that SSAGQ young people who mentioned religion were more likely to report \nhaving never told significant people in their lives about their sexuality including their mothers, brothers, \nteachers, and student welfare coordinators/counsellors.\nWriting Themselves in 3 93 \nTomlin grew up Jehovah’s Witness and found himself alone with his struggle:\nSame sex is morally wrong in [the churches] eyes and they did make several references about it is wrong – \nusing the bible of course. So my crisis of who I was and why I was feeling this was left to me to figure out. I \ncould not ask my friends – especially my family – due to them all been in the religion. (Tomlin, 21 years)\nSimilarly Bethany felt that she was unable to talk about her sexuality with her three older brothers and \nfather, whom she shared a home with:\nThey are all very homophobic and Christian. I fear I would be rejected and outcast. I hate it…I’m a bit \nstuck, a bit confused. I don’t know whether or not to act on [my sexuality]…Whether I should go against \nwhat I’ve been brought up to believe…What’s worse is that being in a Christian family I have no one to talk \nwith about it. (Bethany, 19 years)\nUnlike Tomlin and Bethany, Isaiah had told his mother of his same sex attraction but was too scared to tell \nhis father:\nMy mum has been extremely supportive. My dad doesn’t fully know yet but is extremely homophobic and I \nfear that he will divorce my mum when he finds out because he won’t want anything to do with me. (Isaiah, \n18 years)\nIsaiah’s fear of disclosure was not just for him, but also for his parent’s marriage. \nThese young people experienced isolation and fear due to their family’s religious affiliation. Their fear was \nfuelled by a potential negative reaction rising from their parent’s homophobic beliefs. An individual does \nnot need to experience a negative social reaction directly for them to feel fear or isolation; sometimes \nfear of an imagined negative sanction is more powerful than an actual assault (Savin-Williams, 1990). \nDisclosing ones same sex attraction to family can be traumatic, especially if they are known to reject non-\nheterosexuality (Weeks et al., 2001). \nThe data reveal that young people from the religious group who disclosed their sexuality were less likely \nto receive support from their mothers, fathers, teachers and student welfare coordinators. Ruth explained \nwhat happened to her:\nI was raised in a Christian family so I was constantly embarrassed and disgusted with myself for feeling the \nway I did. I was constantly told it wasn’t natural and that it was just a phase that I was going through. I got \ndepressed and became suicidal. After I told my parents my mum freaked out. I decided a year and a half \nago that I couldn’t stay living with my parents and moved out. (Ruth, 18 years)\n \nWhen Brianna told her school counsellor, she was condemned and abandoned. Her counsellor told her \nshe was under the influence of the Devil and had to convert to the true God to rid of the sin  from herself. \nIn her own words:\n94 Writing Themselves in 3\nThat made me feel like I was evil and there was something wrong, so I started cutting myself, pulling \nout large quantities of my own hair, forcing myself to vomit, bingeing on food until I felt physically ill and \nalternately starving myself…I also started mentally abusing myself and turning to drugs and alcohol to \nsolve my problems. (Brianna, 17 years)\nFor Minika the problem was more extreme and understandably created some anxiety about disclosure:\nWell, my secondary high school was located in an Islamic country, where homosexuality was punishable \nby maximum sentence death, and most common sentence was 20 years. So there was no support at any \nstage of schooling. (Minika, 17 years)\nHomophobic abuse and safety at home\nSSAGQ young people who mentioned religion were more likely to experience homophobic abuse in the \nhome than the non-religious group. Roman grew up in rural Queensland and explained that he became \n‘severely depressed’ from experiencing homophobia. He described what he called homophobia from his \nmother when he disclosed his sexuality to her:\nHer reaction was not good…I got a tirade of homophobic abuse from her, was told I’d die of AIDS, told \nthat God thinks it’s wrong, told that marriage is between a man and a woman and that I was unnatural \nand disgusting. This didn’t help with my confidence…I met my boyfriend…then told my mum about our \nrelationship. She flipped out even worse than before and carried on about HIV, AIDS [and] religion for \nweeks.  (Roman, 21 years)\nAbuse within the home may make young people feel unsafe and isolated within the very place where they \nshould feel loved, empowered, and safe. \nSelf harm and suicide\nOur study found that SSAGQ young people who mentioned religion were more likely to report having \nthoughts of self harm and suicide. Those who mentioned religion were also more likely to have harmed \nthemselves. However, there was no difference between the groups in the percentage of young people \nwho had attempted suicide.\nSebastian was not out to his parents because in his words they were particularly religious and \nhomophobic and very strict Catholic. Sebastian explained where this fear and isolation led him:\nI would generally conduct myself in an unsafe manner as well doing dangerous things such as drugs and \nsleeping with people without a condom.  I have to commute a lot for work and study and on numerous \noccasions I considered veering off the highway into a tree or taking lots different drugs and trying to \noverdose. (Sebastian, 20 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 95 \nA new direction\nCompared to WTIA in 2004, an increasing number of young people in this study have managed to live \nhappily, reconciling being both gay and religious. Many young people wrote of their positive religious \nexperiences growing up; others have actively resisted homophobic religious discourse and reframed \nnarratives of hate and fear to those of love. Andrea was an out and proud catholic lesbian who believed \nthat she was being called to help other young people reconcile their sexuality and faith. She explained \nthat she is a ‘Catholic Lesbian’ and is open about her sexuality to all but her grandparents:\nGod taught about love. So how is being gay against God…I believe in my lifetime I will be someone who \nbrings (LGBT) Children back to the Church and lets them know there is a place for them. I will study \nTheology and see if I can do anything for gay marriage, if I can’t I will still help all the LGBT people [and] let \nthem know there’s a place for them in the Church and Gods Kingdom. (Andrea, 19 years)\nStories from SSAGQ young people of growing up in a homopositive religious environment were more \ncommon than before. Dee told us of her supportive Christian family and community:\nI’ve grown up with a supportive, loving Uniting Church family, and a wider UC Church community, both of \nwhich never went out of their way to mention homosexuality was bad or wrong. (Dee, 20 years)\nAt a church camp Joseph shared a cabin with two other guys, as well as his boyfriend:\nThey both kept an eye and ear out for anybody that was coming towards the cabin if my boyfriend was \nlaying on me or I was hugging him. (Joseph, 18 years)\nThis changing narrative from a religious homonegative environment towards a homopositive one, is \nbeginning to have immediate positive impact on SSAGQ young people’s lives, and is evident in the \ngrowing number of positive religious stories we received.\nMarriage and children\nGetting married and raising children is often the bedrock of religious belief. The growing debate around \nsame sex marriage and gay parenting appears to have a special meaning for the SSAGQ young people \nwho mentioned religion. It provides religious SSAGQ young people with a future of connectivity with the \nonce out of reach religious institutions of family and marriage. Lindsay showed a tenacious spirit, and \nwrote of one day being married in the eyes of her god:\nI don’t know what the future holds, but I am going to keep on going, love myself, and love my God…I will \nbe married in the eyes of God, no matter what the government or the Church try to say. (Lindsay, 18 years)\nLikewise, getting married and having children was so important to Mary that she planned to leave \nAustralia to achieve her dream:\n96 Writing Themselves in 3\nAt the moment I am engaged to my long-time friend of 5 years who I began dating last year. We plan to live \nin Canada in the future to marry and raise a family through IVF. (Mary, 18 years)\nSSAGQ young people are increasingly seeing marriage and children as possibilities in their lives, and this \nis providing those who mention religioned with the ability to live closer to the religious ideals they grew \nup with. The recent discourse of same sex marriage and gay parenting is helping some young people to \nresist homophobic religious messages, and is ultimately helping some to maintain their faith. \nThere is no doubt that, for the majority of those who mentioned religion, it has been a negative and \ndamaging influence from which they feel the need to escape in order to preserve their health and \nwellbeing. For many who make this shift it is literally depicted as a choice between life and death when \nthere appears to be no way forward for them within the church. It is a distressing thing to see young \npeople who are committed to a religious faith and who have much to give to that community of religion \nbeing driven away by homonegativity. Churches are certainly the poorer for the loss of these young \npeople.\nNevertheless, it is clear that a small social shift is occurring within this layer of influence. Some young \npeople are searching out homopositive religious organizations, reframing and ignoring homonegative \nmessages, while others have been fortunate to grow up within religions that are now fully accepting of \nLGBT people. While young people are continually describing religion as out of step with their personal \nbeliefs, they are increasingly willing to remain within it and advocate for change. Just like the movement \nagainst prohibition of female clergy in the past, or the churches support for slavery, some young religious \nSSAGQ youth in Australia today, appear to be heading towards a new era of LGBTI affirming religion.\nRurality \nIn March I am moving to Brisbane, from my regional town. I don’t know what is going to happen, but \nin a few months time I will have something other than a few books, two mates, a gay ex-teacher and \nthe internet, in order to be a part of the ‘gay community’. In an earlier question I answered that the gay \ncommunity did not supply me with any useful information. That’s because I have never being A PART of the \ngay community!  Longreach just doesn’t have one. (Jackie, 18 years) \nKey findings\n• 20% of young people came from rural and remote areas.\n• Young people living in rural, regional and remote areas were less likely to have access to the \ninternet compared to their urban counterparts.\n• Rural young people were felt less safe on the internet.\n• Young people expressed concern about their lives as SSAGQ young people living in rural and \nremote towns due to the isolation, discrimination and lack of appropriate services and support.\n• Self harm, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were higher in rural areas. \n• There were higher rates of use of some drugs in remote areas.\nWriting Themselves in 3 97 \nAs mentioned in Chapter 3, The Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Areas Classification (RRMA) was used \nto divide young people into categories of remoteness. According to the RRMA index, 67% (n=1975) \nof young people came from metropolitan zones (including major cities), 18% (n=662) came from \nrural zones and 2% (n=49) from remote zones. This represents a slight increase in the percentage of \nparticipants from rural zones compared to the 2004 survey.\nIn this report we have defined rural as outside of the metropolitan zone and include remote as part of \nrurality. There are many reasons to believe that life may be different for SSAGQ young people in rural \nareas, not the least because of a greater level of surveillance, more conservative attitudes and fewer \nservices in these areas. We once again looked for any significant differences between rural and urban \nyoung people on a range of factors, including how they felt about their sexuality, internet access, self \nharm and suicide attempts, sexual behaviour and attraction, STIs, drug and alcohol use, general health \nand support networks.\nAs mentioned in the above quote the internet assists many  SSAGQ youth in finding community, \nespecially those who are living in rural and remote zones. Interestingly young people who live in rural \nand remote areas were more likely to feel unsafe on the internet, despite the internet been mentioned \nnumerous times as a place to find gay community. \nAs in the previous reports, throughout the survey many young people expressed concern about their lives \nas SSAGQ young people living in rural and remote towns due to the isolation, discrimination and lack of \nappropriate services and support. In many cases these young people were looking forward to moving to \nurban areas to attend university. \nMy hopes are to finish year 12. Leave [this town ]and not return. I FUCKING HATE IT HERE!.. so really I just \nwant to leave and I cannot be happy until I do (Fin, 17 years)\nIt is well known that specific services for SSAGQ young people in regional and remote areas are difficult \nto access, if they exist. Privacy can be an issue in small towns where everyone knows everyone, therefore \nmaking accessing available services difficult. Despite no differences in support of family, friends or \nprofessionals between urban, rural, regional and remote areas, there were, however , differences in rates \nof self harm and attempted suicides in young people in some of the RMMA categories. Suicidal ideation \nand attempts were higher in rural areas. This could be a reflection of the lack of access to support \nservices and feelings of isolation and is in line with higher rates of suicide in general in rural areas.\nIn regards to sexual health, pregnancy rates and sexual behaviours there were no differences between \nurban young people and their rural, regional and remote counterparts. \nThe excessive use of some drugs by young people in remote areas compared to their urban and rural \ncounterparts was significant. This is a worrying trend however the findings should be considered with \ncaution because numbers of young people in the study who lived in remote areas were small (n=49). It \nmay just be that isolation leads to a more painful situation for which drug taking is seen as the remedy.\n98 Writing Themselves in 3\nAccording to their stories, growing up in regional and remote areas appears to be another layer added \nto the difficulties that SSAGQ young people often face. There are few support services most particularly \nin remote regions and no visible gay culture to affirm who they are.  There remains an air of secrecy \nabout one’s sexuality in rural, regional and remote areas for fear of discrimination and violence and many \nstories documented these concerns.\nAll I can say from coming from a big city such as Melbourne where same sex couples are well common \nand you see a lot of us around and coming to a rural town where most same sex couples ‘hide and live \nin fear’ is hard to believe that we live in the same country!! There isn’t anything around here unless we \ntravel to (regional centre) nearly 1.5 hours away!! There has been a few suicides here lately where the guy/\ngirls have spoke about their sexuality and become victims of abuse and ignorance from the community!! \nNarrow minded people in this town (Harriet, 19 years)\nIt was pleasing to see one exception to the many negative stories about living in rural and remote areas:\nMy town is very open towards the gay community (in fact we have a remarkably large gay community, \nalmost 1 in 7 people in the town, which is amazing for country town – Armidale NSW) (Honora, 18 years)\nGender questioning young people\nWhat I hope for most is acceptance of all queer and non-standard people in the mainstream; to not only \nhave diverse people present and represented, but to have any form of oppression or exclusion denounced \nand condemned.\nMore directly affecting me, I would like to see a broadening view of the gay and lesbian community. For a \ngroup that commonly uses the GLBT label, the community is remarkably hostile towards transgendered \npeople [most often excluding or abusing us] and even bisexual people [by ignoring or pressuring to ‘make \ntheir minds up’]. I wouldn’t mind so much if the ‘GLBT’ community just focussed on homosexuality - after \nall, being trans and being same sex-attracted are very different things, despite often overlapping. But the \nfact is that gay and lesbian groups so often tack on the B and T, and sometimes even an I - which most \npeople don’t even know about - and then provide no services or support, or even use language to directly \nexclude us.\nAlso, the whole push for same sex marriage kinda obfuscates the fact that intersex children are still \nsystematically being subjected to genital mutilation, transgendered people are refused medical treatment \nand legal recognition, and there are a still vast legal inequalities in many other areas for same sex couples. \nIt seems like the whole lack-of-human-rights thing gets lost in the marriage discussion. (Quinn, 20 years)\nKey findings\n• Ninety-one young people (3%) described their gender identity as gender queer, transgender or \nother.\n• While they were more likely to be out than other SSAY, they were less likely to get support. They \nwere also at greater risk of homelessness, physical abuse, self harm and suicide.\nWriting Themselves in 3 99 \n• GQ young people were more likely to have moved schools or dropped out of school as a result \nof homophobia, and to have had difficulties at school such as in concentrating , lower marks \nand hiding at recess and lunchtime.\n• Many of these young people aspired to make a difference in the world despite the extra \ndifficulties they faced, and felt pride in their diversity. This group was twice as likely to get \ninvolved in activism in response to the discrimination they faced.\nThe Writing Themselves In surveys have always been open to young people with diverse gender \nidentities. We have ensured we included their stories in the previous reports. However, this year, we \nwanted to be more active in accommodating this group within the survey. \nIn 2010 around 3% of young people participating in the survey were neither male nor female but \nidentified their gender in a range of other ways including transgender, gender queer, androgynous and \nhermaphrodite.\nMore of the survey participants from this group were of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander backgrounds. \nThey were less likely to be at school and less likely to live in their family home than SSAY. \nI’m out of home and living in Melbourne now and I live in a strong and supportive community of queer, \ntrans and feminist people who provide safe spaces for me to live my life and learn how to take care of \nmyself. But this community isn’t supported by society at large, it has to support itself. I’m happy with myself \nbut I’m angry at the way I’m made to live my life within the world. I’m marginalised, discriminated against \nand made second class by the law.  (Jo, 21 years)\nGQ young people were generally as likely to see themselves as having attraction to more than one sex, \nas they were to see themselves as attracted exclusively to a same sex. But their visions of same sex and \nsexes generally were variable and highly personalised. \nThis group was more evenly divided in their identifications than young men and young women. They were \ntwice as likely to have had penetrative sex under the age of 13 than SSAY. It was concerning to discover \nthat two thirds did not use a condom the last time they had penetrative sex and that 9% had been \ndiagnosed with an STI.\nI’m in a same sex relationship but attracted to all people regardless of gender. I identify as pansexual and \ngender queer and refuse to accept that there are only two sexes. My mum is a lesbian and my family is \nmy friends and friends of my mums who are all queer or queer friendly. To be honest my sexuality was \nnever really an issue because I was lucky enough to be raised by parents that had many queer fiends and \nrelatives. It was a bigger deal for me to come out about my mum’s sexuality when I was 14 than it was for \nme to come out about my own sexuality when I was 17. I’ve used the internet to explore my gender identity \nmore than I have to explore my sexual identity as that was more of a complex process. I wouldn’t be me if I \nwasn’t Queer!( Al, 18 years)\n100 Writing Themselves in 3\nExperiences of abuse and discrimination\nGQ young people were more likely to have been physically abused and to have been discriminated \nagainst in the form of being socially excluded, graffiti written about them and written abuse. They were \nat more risk of abuse on the street, at home and at work.  Considering their experiences of abuse and \ndiscrimination, it is unsurprising that these young people felt less safe at many locations. \nSelf harm, suicide and wellbeing \nGQ young people were at increased risk of self harm and suicide attempts with almost half having self \nharmed and 28% having attempted suicide. They were also twice as likely to have injected drugs than \nSSAY. \nWhen i got beat up i went to the police because i had been put in hospital over it, other times nothing, just \ntried to ignore it as it seems like nothing would ever get done about it. At school they werent exactly the \nmost supportive and turned a pretty big blind eye to it all. There is a point when you can only handle so \nmuch of not being okay, and i had/have reached that point. We arent given a choice about how we feel \n(sexuality wise) its just the way it is, and it gets really difficult when your constantly told it is wrong or not \nokay. It is also really really unsettling waking up knowing your a female but wishing with every ounce of you \nthat one day u’ll wake up and be a male. It really screws with your head when you know exactly how you \nare feeling but there is not really anyone you can talk to about it. (Skyler, 21 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 101 \nSupport Needs\nGQ young people were more likely to disclose their sexual identity than SSAY. This may be because it \nis more difficult to hide gender non-conformity, or these young people may need more support in their \ndaily experiences and were reaching out. However, we found that this group was less supported in their \ndisclosures than SSAY. \nSexuality Education\nThese young people reported a different experience of Sexuality Education overall to SSAY, and were less \nlikely to report receiving a number of messages. It is also possible that teachers may be more nervous \nabout delivering this message with a transgender student in the class if they are unclear of their school’s \nstance on the issue, or under confident about their knowledge of the issues. These data highlight several \ngaps in the Sexuality Education of GQ young people and the need for schools, teachers and sexuality \neducators to highlight messages that include gender diversity more directly and strongly. It also points to \nthe possibility that Australian students generally miss out on learning about transsexual, intersex, gender \nqueer and other perspectives.\nSchool Experience\nThese students were more than twice as likely to feel very unsafe at school and twice as likely to \nclassify their school as very homophobic overall. The data also revealed that homophobia has affected \ntheir schooling even more than SSAY. Twice as many of this student group reported that as a result of \nhomophobia, they had moved schools (22%), left school altogether (22%), been unable to use the toilet \n(24%) and been unable to use the change rooms (35%). A greater portion of these students than other \nSSAY had difficulty concentrating in class (42%), dropped their marks (34%), missed classes (36%), \nmissed days (35%), hid at recess and lunch (32%), and dropped out of extra-curricular activities (23%). \nHowever, a positive finding for this group was that they were also over twice as likely as SSAY to become \ninvolved in activism as a result of the homophobia they suffered at school. This shows that while many in \nthis group were suffering at school, some are also making attempts at changing their own circumstances \nand school cultures generally. Several of the young people in this group took the opportunity provided by \nthe survey to call for schools to start tackling homophobia and transphobia more directly. \nWhile their resources are there, I feel that teachers took a biased stance with my problems especially. \nWhile I understand that transsexualism is uncommon, it’s their responsibility to be educated about an issue \nthat arises among students, especially if it has effects as severe as the ones I suffered (Reagan, 17 years).\nWhile the numbers of these young people in this study are still small these findings are indicative of an \nemerging group with urgent needs which are not at present on the health and education agenda. \n102 Writing Themselves in 3\nSkyler’s story, 21 years\nIts just really hard to begin something like this, its like where do i start. DO i start with when i was a kid and \nall i wanted to play with the boys, get dirty, ride bikes, play football, play with cars, climb trees. I refused \nto wear dresses, play with barbies, wear anything that wasnt from the ‘boys’ section, and when puberty \nhit, buy a bra, as much as mum tried it was sports bras or nothing. So now looking back on that i really \nwonder if all along i was trying to speak out to mum and dad that i wanted to be a boy...i was a boy..i was \njust trapped in a female body. Until now i never really took the time to understand it though, i was just a tom \nboy that liked doing those things. \n2010 and my life is still going, i have just come out as trans (FtM) and am dealing with the emotions that \ncome with that, loosing friends left, right and centre, and generally not being okay or having the support \ni need to get through each day. I am gettin abused for things beyond my control,  i have lost the respect \nfrom people i hold closest. And that is hard. But i have learnt that some people dont make it to your future \nand that is totally okay with me, theres a reason they dont. \nMy family: Dad- struggles with loosing his little girl, the white wedding, the big family. He was brought up \nin a highly religous family and finds it really hard accepting me, and thats without coming out as trans to \nhim. Mum- Amazing. Although she struggled to begin with aswell she has come around, her struggles \nwhere quite different, she was worried about my safety and mental health as she knows how hard it is to \nlive in such a judgemental community. Sister- More then i could ever ask. With every decision i make she \nis right there, beside me offering me a hand up when i need it. Brother- Drug addict. He is never around to \nunderstand or spend any time with. To him i do not exist.\nFriends: I have had more people walk in and out of my life then i can count. I’m not exactly sure why but it \nis something i have just got use to over the years. i have a amazing support network around me now and \nthats all that matters. The people that love me for me have stuck around through thick and thin and will \ncontinue to do so. And to me, thats all that truly matters.\nMy past holds alot of hurt, and is something i have run away from for a really long time. After having to have \nan abortion at 14 after being sexually assaulted by a guy i was seeing to prove to people i wasnt gay, my \nlife just seemed to go downhill, spirally out of control. I was outed by my principal to my father and youth \nworker. I was outed by my year adviser to my whole grade. I actually didnt come out to anyone...it was \ndone for me. I have been bullied. I have been beat up. I have been sexually assaulted. and i have been \nkicked out of home. All because of something people had assumed. I hadnt even thought about who i was \nyet, let alone coming out as gay. Above all. Because of something i have no control over.\nMy experience of growing up as same sex was not enjoyable, even in the slightest, i self harmed, i drank, i \ndid drugs, all to deal with my emotions and how i was feelings. I did not in anyway want to wake up in the \nmorning any given day. Although it seems that bad times have been a large part of my life, it also make me \nsee the good days in amazing light. I am still alive and i am who i want to be. I have created change. I have \nmade people think. I have helped people understand. I have made people smile and laugh, and that is \nsomething that is priceless. Now that my future ahead of me is unknown, i am excited. I am working a full \ntime job, and i am living a full time life. I am no way okay but i will be.\nThere is a hell of a long journey ahead of me. Maybe one day i’ll sit down and write out my whole story. But \nright now, that is all i have. My life is going to be what i make of it, no more, no less. I can do whatever i \nwant if you i put my head to it, so maybe i’ll make some change to something i dislike. who knows where \nmy feet are going to take me next. \n \nWriting Themselves in 3 103 \nConclusion –  \n“I love my life”\nWhen i first realised i was gay, i didnt want to accept it. I struggled with this for years, as well as peer \npressures etc. I struggled under strong depression, causing difficulties studying, sleeping, which let to \nfurther depression, in a vicious cycle which also led to self harm. At about 15 i underwent a change. Its \na difficult thing to explain but i just got sick of it. I had to use willpower i didnt know i had, and faced my \ndemons. I took control of my own mind for the first time in years and just accepted i was gay, and i had \nlife and what a rare beautiful thing it was and i was wasting it. From that point i came to love who i am and \nsince then i have changed so much and while i still have difficulties with homophobia, i love my life and \nmyself and am proud of where i am today. (Denny, 17 years)\nIt has been a privilege doing research with same sex attracted young people over the last twelve years, \nand in that time have seen many changes, most of which are positive ones, occurring in the worlds of \nthese young people. One of the largest changes is in their visibility and in the expanding numbers we \nhave been able to access each time. Greater numbers have made a more robust analysis possible, \nand this has also confirmed the essential verity of those first tentative findings in 1998. Homophobia has \nalways been a problem and SSAGQ young people are forced to negotiate lives in environments which \nsubject them to rejection, threats and abuse. This will clearly take some time to change.\nOn the good side, however, the most encouraging of all our findings is the degree to which, over the \ntwelve years, this picture has begun to change. This is largely due to the efforts of the young people \nthemselves, but also to the many advocates for their cause creating change, and to a progressive shift in \nsocial attitudes towards a more relaxed and appreciative view of sexual and gender diversity.\nWhile we remain disappointed to see the amount of verbal and physical abuse escalate every time we \nconduct the survey, we also see this as a response to fewer young people being prepared to be in hiding. \nThere has been a marked change in the number of young people who have told someone about their \nsexuality. In 1998 one in five participants had told nobody, in 2010 a tiny percentage had spoken to no \none at all. \nIn speaking every one of them has taken a risk, however well they may have planned their approach and \nscanned the environment to prepare for the moment. It is about this moment of risk that we have our \nmost significant findings so far. What happens when they disclose, irrespective of who the chosen person \nis, becomes critical for the health and wellbeing of the young person, for their mental health and safety \nand for their immediate future. Either they will be supported and get a response which is, on balance, \nmore positive than negative, or they will be rejected. Those young people who take the risk of telling and \nare met with condemnation and rejection are more likely to feel bad about their sexuality, to self harm and \nattempt suicide than those who have had a positive response. Young people disclose to a wide range of \npeople – family members, friends and professionals, all of whom have a unique opportunity to make a \n104 Writing Themselves in 3\ncritical difference to a young life. It is clear that everyone in the community is on the team that can save a \nlife if the opportunity presents, and we must look at ways to ensure that we are well prepared to take it. \nWhile homophobia in schools (as in other places) has increased over the twelve years, we have seen \nsome remarkable changes in the capacity of schools to support and protect the SSAGQ young people in \ntheir care. School personnel are more widely used for disclosure and young people feel safer at school. \nThe 2010 data give us substantial evidence of the impact of these changes. Schools that have policies \nin place to support SSAGQ students go some way towards protecting them from harm. Schools which \nwere perceived by students to be supportive in all respects have a strong and significant influence on the \nmental health and safety of the SSAGQ young people who attend.\nYoung people themselves are fighting back in ways we have not seen before. Their voices are stronger \nand they are often angry about what homophobia is doing to them. In much greater numbers than before \nthey are finding information on the internet to fill the gaps that school and family will not fill. They are \nfinding other SSAGQ young people on social networking sites and getting the support and advice from \npeers that heterosexual young people take for granted. They are forming or joining groups for activism on \nFacebook and other sites, aspiring to help other SSAGQ youth to live in a kinder world. They are fighting \nback in the real world by demanding change at school, starting their own gay/straight alliances and \ninitiating community projects for change.\nMost of all they are taking advantage of the social shifts which give them more legitimacy and the \nopportunity to draw on more positive discourses to plan their lives. They see a future where equality is \npossible, where belonging to a religion and being gay is not out of the question. They plan to marry and \nhave families like everyone else, they plan to work for change because they believe it is an achievable \ngoal. \nIn greater numbers than ever before they communicate to us about a love of life. Sometimes this is a \nnarrative of recovery from the sense of worthlessness homophobic abuse can bring:\nI love my life! There was a time a year or two ago when i was not very happy or healthy, but i overcame \nthat with the support of my friends and family. Now, i am proud to be who i am, and i believe that sexuality \nhas no boundaries. There is no right or wrong way to love someone, so i am just enjoying getting out there \nand meeting awesome LGBT and people and having a good time. I would like other people to know that \nhomosexuality is not a bad thing or a curse, as i’m sure many close-minded people believe. If anything, i \nprefer having fluid sexuality, and if i could choose to be straight, gay, bisexual, whatever, i would choose to \nbe a lesbian, over and over (Allegra, 17 years)\nOthers write simply of the joy in their lives right at this moment:\nI love loving girls. There’s so much to like. I don’t have a problem with homosexuality even with my \nreligious beliefs. Who has time for hate? I don’t. It’s a wasted emotion. I love my life, and I love that I love \ngirls (Saskia, 20 years)\nWriting Themselves in 3 105 \nMy life as a gay man is mostly fine. I love being gay, I love my life. (Mickey, 18 years)\n I dont care what others say and I love my life. I would never want it any other way. (Penny, 17 years)\nFor others it is the hopes and dreams around what the future holds and the prospect of helping others \nthat creates happiness and optimism: \nWhen I am older I hope to join the police force to help crack down on hate crimes against gay people and \nto follow my dream of becoming a forensic scientist. I also want to work with teenagers though and help \nthem through life. I also want to have children and maybe even a wife (Misty, 16 years)\nI’m currently working my way towards a Law degree, so I can eventually one day become a prosecutor, \nfight for gay rights, and one day become a High Court Judge, just like Michael Kirby. I want to help make \nAustralia a better place for gay people, and I know I will.(Mickey, 18 years)\nThe young people who love their lives right now are an inspiration and show us that celebration can be \nintegral to same sex attraction and gender questioning. We dedicate this report to these young people, \nas well as to those who are still struggling. We admire their courage, energy, aspirations and dreams and \nhope we can make some contribution to their work in the future.\n106 Writing Themselves in 3\nWriting Themselves in 3 107 \nRecommendations\nThe biggest issue emerging from this research is the ongoing and persistent damage done by \nhomophobia in the lives of SSAGQ young people. The all pervading nature of homophobia is a public \nhealth issue and should be addressed by government funded public education campaigns designed to \nalert the public to its dangers and challenge those who promulgate it.  \nPublic safety\nSSAGQ young people continue to experience high levels of homophobic violence and abuse not just at \nschool but also on the street, in sport and at public and private events.\nMuch of this goes unreported by young people for fear of exposure of their sexual identity. Police \nprograms which liaise with the gay community and seek to make reporting easier should be protected \nand expanded.\nCyber-safety\nUse of the internet plays a very particular role in the lives of SSAGQ young people providing them with \nsafety and support which may be superior to that available to them in the real world. With this in mind, \ncyber-safety programs should incorporate a particular understanding of the needs of SSAGQ young \npeople and their considerable skills and experience at managing safe internet use.\nEducation\nThere is clear evidence in this report that schools can make a major contribution to the health and \nsafety of SSAGQ students by effectively addressing homophobia. All education authorities should show \nleadership in this area with clear policies and adequate resourcing to ensure all Australian schools are \nlegitimised and supported in this work.\nSchools should have a specific policy on homophobic bullying which offers well-publicised protection to \nSSAGQ students.\nSuch policies should be implemented as part of a whole school approach to ensuring a supportive \nenvironment for SSAGQ students. For more information see www.safeschoolscoalitionvictoria.org.\nau. Those who offer one to one counselling and support to young people in schools should be trained \nto receive and work with a disclosure about sexual orientation or gender identity in a positive, non-\njudgemental and constructive manner.\n108 Writing Themselves in 3\nSexuality Education\nA significant number of SSAGQ young people find the Sexuality Education at their school not at all useful, \nor only moderately useful. It is recommended that schools continue to incorporate material inclusive of \nSSAGQ young people into their Sexuality Education programs. \nThe higher rate of pregnancy amongst SSA young women is indicative of the need for all schools to \nensure they have sexuality education programs which give clear messages about sexual behaviours \nrather than make assumptions based on identity.\nAt least half SSAGQ young people realise they are same sex attracted while they are still in primary \nschool. It is recommended that attention be paid to the use of inclusive and representative materials \nthroughout the primary school curriculum, as well as throughout all secondary school years. \nThis study has found particular gaps in the Sexuality Education of students questioning their gender. \nSexuality education should fully address issues of gender expectations and stereotyping as well covering \ngender diversity more directly and strongly. \nHealth services\nPersonnel in health services are respected by young people and could play a greater role in supporting \nthose who are SSAGQ young people through the process of disclosure if they were more trusted. It is \nrecommended that health services undertake training in gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) \nsensitive service delivery and actively signal to SSAGQ young people through waiting room posters and \nservice promotion that they are welcome.\nIt is clear from this research that sexuality labels do not predict sexual attraction or behaviours in a \nsimplistic fashion, particularly for young people. Health professionals need training to take sexual \nhistories in a non-judgemental manner with young people, and to understand the best options for \ninformation and referrals. \nThe access of rural young people to appropriate and supportive services is an ongoing concern.\n• Programs which work with SSAGQ young people in rural areas should be continued as a \nmeans of linking these young people into mainstream health services\n• Rural health services should be particularly targeted for training around GLBT sensitivity and \nsupport\nWriting Themselves in 3 109 \nParents\nParents play an essential role in determining how resilient SSAGQ young people can be according to how \nthey respond to a disclosure. Parents need both education and support to be prepared for a possible \ndisclosure and sometimes to manage their own feelings of disappointment or apprehension. \n• P-Flag organisations in all states and territories should be fostered and supported with \ngovernment funding to ensure their availability and viability.\n• Information about same sex attraction and gender diversity should be included in all \nmainstream material about adolescent health that may be accessed by parents.\nParents of CALD backgrounds appear from this research to require special attention and this area \nwarrants further investigation to see what the best means of meeting these information needs might be.\nFurther research\nGender questioning young people are an emerging group which have not been the major focus of this \nresearch but their increased visibility indicates that as a group they warrant further investigation to better \nunderstand their health and support needs.\nLittle is known about the means to best prepare parents for a disclosure from a SSAGQ son or daughter, \nor how best to offer them with information and support should it be necessary after a disclosure. This is \nan area for further investigation. \n110 Writing Themselves in 3\nReferences\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics. (2009).

    "abstract": "Executive Summary \n\nIntroduction \n\nThis is the third of the Writing Themselves In national reports which have been conducted six years apart since 1998. In 2010, a total of 3134 same sex attracted and gender questioning (SSAGQ) young people participated in Writing Themselves In 3 (WTi3), almost double the number in 2004 and more than four times that of 1998.\n\nThe participants, who were aged between 14 and 21 years, came from all states and territories of Australia, from remote (2%), rural (18%) and urban (67%) areas and from a range of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. There were more young women (57%) than young men (41%) and a smaller group (3%) who were gender questioning (GQ).\n\nSexual feelings \n\nIn 2010, the complex interaction of sexual attraction, identity and behaviour was even more evident than in previous studies. Most young men were exclusively same sex attracted but half of the young women were attracted to both sexes and less than one third exclusively to the same sex. More than a third of young people realized their sexual difference before puberty and there were few gender differences in age of first realization.\n\nMore young people felt positive about their same sex attraction than in 2004. As in 2004, young people who felt bad about their sexuality used homophobic beliefs to describe their reasons whereas those who felt good used resistant, affirming explanations.\n\nSexual identity \n\nMost young men identified as gay/homosexual. Young women were more likely to identify as bisexual. Young women chose a greater range of identity terms to describe their sexuality",
