Really, you don’t expect people to with BB guns and shooting people cause it’s so safe here.”UPD did not fi nd an apparent motive for the shooting and the suspects did not seem to know the victim, Santos said.Offi cers seized the BB pistol and several carbon dioxide canisters used to fi re the BB gun from the dorm room, Santos said.“The BB gun pistol that was used close-ly resembled a real gun,” Santos said, “and would have been treated so by law enforce-ment if  they did not know it was a BB gun.”Jay Atkins, a sophomore behavioral sci-ence major and resident of  campus village is hoping he will not be victimized.“I don’t think you’re supposed to have no guns on campus,” Atkins said. “I don’t even know the regulations, though.”BB guns are one of  the dangerous items prohibited in campus housing, according to the 2007-2008 Housing Licence Agree-ment Booklet of  2006-2007.If  a student resident is found with a danger-ous item it “may result in revocation of  (their) license agreement,” according to the booklet.“You’d think it’s safe,” said Mallory Labro, a junior dance major and resident of  Campus Village. “But we live by a lot of  unsafe people.”UPD is currently contacting other pos-sible victims, Santos said.Anyone with information about this crime is urged to contact UPD at (408) 924-2222 or the confi dential crime line at (408) 924-2236.Housing offi cials were not available for comment as to what actions will be taken against Kaar and Gooben.Two students detained  for fi ring BB gun  Staff  WriterBy SARRAH S. NGUYENA research team led by Michael Graham, an SJSU associate professor in Moss Landing Marine Laborato-ries, has discovered vast green forests of  kelp once believed to be endan-gered or extinct.Graham teaches and conducts his research at the laboratories, a nation-al research facility consisting of  seven CSU campuses including SJSU.A journal of  the research team’s discovery of  the kelp in the Gala-pagos Islands was published in the Sept. 24 issue of  “Proceedings of  the Natural Academy of  Sciences.”“The water is like uncharted territory,” Graham said of  search-ing in the Galapagos Islands. “To have a model that works, it’s a sign of  where science is now.”According to an SJSU news re-lease, predictions of  the existence of  this kelp, Eisenia galapagensis, and its location were based on “information from satellites and oceanographic instruments on conditions including light, depth and nutrient availability.”“What this model does for us is to track these populations,” Graham said. “To ask questions about their health, it can potentially set up man-agement areas for their protection.”Graham said they had complet-ed a lot of  research in preparation for the expedition.“This demonstrates that we have enough information to make good predictions where organisms live on this planet,” he said.However, Graham said he had some diffi culty receiving funds for the search.“When we came up with this model, people didn’t think it could be true,” Graham said. “It was hard to get money to get on this cruise.”Professor’s discovery of kelp may lead to removal of species from endangered listStaff  WriterBy SAMUEL LAMMark Savage, a senior sociology major, was recently named as one of  15 college students from across the country to partici-pate on Campus Progress’ student advisory board for his second straight year.Campus Progress, the nonprofi t, non-partisan think tank, a branch of  the Cen-ter for American Progress, was started in February 2005 and continues to promote progressive student values in America, said Ramya Raghavan, communications and outreach manager for Campus Progress.While there are around 150 student representatives from about 140 colleges for Campus Progress, the 15 members of  the student advisory board, including students from Harvard and Georgetown, push the di-rection of  the organization, Raghavan said.“You have to get a student interested be-fore they want to get involved and show them how it affects them personally,” Savage said.This year, Savage said, he wants to focus on a hip-hop lecture series, as he is also in-volved in Hip-Hop Congress’s SJSU chap-ter. He is in charge of  setting up events and assembling a list of  guest speakers that will travel to campuses nationwide.“He basically has total ownership over this project,” Raghavan said.Savage said they are launching three major national issue campaigns that will affect students through 2008 including the Iraq war, climate change and student debt and college affordability.Sarah Jasso, a freshman psychology major, said politics don’t really pertain to her but she would participate in a campus event if  it involved bringing our troops home from Iraq.“I have, like, fi ve family members over in the war right now, so I’m pretty against it,” Jasso said.Raghavan said their campaign strategies include policy work on issues, working with Congress to get legislation passed, working with students to collect signatures and any on-ground efforts that could raise awareness.“The fi rst step is to educate the stu-dents,” Savage said.Campus Progress is sponsoring an essay contest for students who write an op-ed on college affordability that gets published in their campus paper. The winner receives $2,500, which helps raise awareness about the issue and allows a student to help pay off  their fees, said Raghavan.She also said a climate change confer-ence called Power Shift will be held in the Washington D.C. area from Nov. 2 to Nov. 5 with 3,000 high school and college stu-dents who care about global warming.Raghavan said members of  Campus Progress have taken road trips through the South and West Coast, visiting 10 to 12 col-leges at a time to discuss issues that affect their campuses directly or as students in general.She said that there is a lot of  work to be done and out of  the 4,000 or so colleges around the nation they’ve worked with stu-SJSU senior appointed to national think tankStaff  WriterBy MICHAEL PASAOASee SAVAGE, page 2See KELP, page 2Neighborhood gardens yield food for campus eateriesA group of  environmentally con-scious SJSU students have been grow-ing vegetables on private properties near campus since January.This October the students plan to sell the vegetables to SJSU, to be used in Dining Commons, the Market Cafe and the Student Union.“That’d be nice,” said Stephanie Choy a junior bio chemistry major. “It’d be a different alternative from Burger King and Sbarros.”Amie Frisch, an SJSU alumna, ap-proached Executive Chef  Jay Marshall about the possibility of  selling the locally grown food on campus.“I think it’s a great option,” Marshall said. “We started offering organic food last semester.”The latest crop should begin harvest-ing as early as October and “we’ll start serving it then,” Marshall said.“We’ll just insert the food somewhere where it fi ts and go from there,” Mar-shall said.Mark Anthony Medeiros, a junior so-ciology and environmental studies major started the appropriately named “Veg-gielution” project by posting a few fl yers around neighborhoods just east of  SJSU.Medeiros was simply looking for some available land to grow his own vegetables.“But after getting 10 or 15 phone calls from homeowners who were interested, I started to think this little project could be bigger,” he said. “I started to make contacts with other students who might be interested.”Medeiros sent out a message about the garden project to the environmental club e-mail list in February, and soon after, then-student Amie Frisch contacted him.The fi rst garden started to produce in February and March. Soon it was fl ourishing with corn, beans, squash, peppers, onions, carrots, tomatoes and lettuce, Medeiros said.By April, a second garden was being planted near campus at the home of  Staff  WriterBy CHRISSY RAMONEDAPHOTO COURTESY OF MOSS LANDING MARINE LABMichael Graham, an SJSU associate professor at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, holds up kelp discovered in the Galapagos Islands once thought to be extinct.

You may also submit information in writing to DBH 209.Lawrence Bryan, a former SJSU math-ematics and computer science professor. Bryan saw a fl yer, and later received an e-mail about the “Veggielution” project.“It seemed like a good idea,” Bryan said. “We’d had gardens down here before but at some point it became too much to do.” Bryan not only offers his land, which edges alongside coyote creek, he also sup-plies them with a drip irrigation system and gardening tools.“I think I actually picked up a shovel once, too,” Bryan said.After following a steep concrete stairway, edged with terraces, you’ll not only fi nd the sprouting vegetables but also a beautifully cluttered array of  alder, mulberry, syca-more, pomegranate and cherry trees.“I let them pick my mulberries and gorge on them,” Bryan said.Word of  the “Veggielution” project has spread and now around 10 students tend the local crops on a regular basis. Wednes-day nights are designated to cookouts, us-ing their own vegetables when possible, and Saturday mornings are their “workdays.”“It’s a really healthy outlet,” said Na-thaniel Browning, a junior sociology ma-jor. “I think it gets us connected to com-munity. We get together, we eat together. We’re creating a different kind of  commu-nity than is available.”“We do this instead of  watching TV,” Frisch said.Tomatoes from the garden have al-ready been stewed into sauce, canned in masen jars by the growers themselves and given to helpful volunteers and the gener-ous homeowners.“We want food. And we want to grow our own food,” Medeiros said. “It’s decep-tively simple what we’re doing here.”“Veggielution” has spread even farther than SJSU’s boundaries. Frisch, now an SJSU alumna in environmental studies, spoke “at the UCSB sustainability confer-ence this past June and inspired a group of  Chico students to replicate her efforts,” according to the CSU Chico sustainable future Web site.Frisch has been asked to speak about the garden project at CSU Chico’s third annual This Way to Sustainability confer-ence being held Nov. 1 through Nov. 4.Continued from page 1VEGGIE // Former SJSU professor offers up his landJonathan Tran, a sophomore bi-ology major, said that he wasn’t aware of  the research, but was glad to see that the science department is getting recognized.“It makes our science department look good,” Tran said. “It makes our school look more distinguished.”There were no students involved in the discovery of  the kelp, but Graham said that with the success of  this search, he will have some SJSU students on board for the next expedition.“We’ll be doing other cruises in the next few years,” Graham said. “They will do diving, sampling and things that go to the museums.”Jesus Contreras, a junior electri-cal engineering major, said he hopes students will be more involved with future researches. Contreras said he plans to take some science courses next year, and the discovery benefi ts the science department.“It’s good that it’s bringing SJSU credibility,” Contreras said. “The discovery turned out good for SJSU overall.”Shannon Bros, a biological sci-ences professor and close colleague of  Graham said that both gradu-ate and undergraduate students have the opportunity to engage in research with Graham.“It’s really exciting to get in-volved with him,” Bros said. “This could be something to encourage students to do the program.”Bros also said the discovery has given the science department a boost in spirit.“Anytime you get something like this, it adds stimulus to everybody,” Bros said. “Everyone’s caught up in the excitement.”The effect of  this discovery could lead to the removal of  this species of  kelp from the World Conservation Union threatened species list.Graham said that this discovery would help bring focus to different possible climate changes.“There is so much interest in planet change, now the attention is focusing in the systems we know,” Graham said. Continued from page 1KELP // Next expedition to include SJSU studentsdents from more than 500 campuses.“I think it’s very hard to get students involved at this campus right now because a lot of  students are on their own path and they want to graduate,” Savage said.Savage said he heard of  Campus Prog-ress through an e-mail that his friend sent through a list server and ended up attending the national student conference in June 2006 where Barack Obama was a guest speaker.“When I saw him speak, it really showed that this organization was moving in the right direction,” Savage said. “Af-ter I saw that they could bring such big people out, and stuff  like that, I wanted to be able to work with them.”Other key speakers have included Bill Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Talib Kweli and Cornel West.An annual conference is held every June with more than 1,000 students from across the country to meet other leading youth organizations. Savage said he is fl y-ing to Washington D.C. on Thursday to meet the other 14 other student advisory board members during their retreat.Continued from page 1SAVAGE // Sen. Barack Obama inspired student involvementThe Spartan Daily reported on Sept. 26, 2007, that Destyny Gutierrez’s roommate moved out of  her apartment without provid-ing her money for the rent. This is not correct. The story should have reported that Gutierrez asked for legal ad-vice regarding whether she needed to return her roommate’s deposit money, or if  the money stayed with the apartment. The story should have also re-ported that marketing Professor Jeff  Kallis is a practicing attorney at the law fi rm of  Kallis & Associates.The Spartan Daily reported on Sept. 26, 2007, that SJSU’s campus smoking policy states, “smoking is prohibited within 15 feet of  door-ways.” This is not correct.The Academic Senate passed a Policy Recommendation on May 5, 2003, which stated: “beginning in Fall 2003 smoking and, when possible, ashtrays on the SJSU campus shall be restricted to areas no less than 25 feet from any public entrance to or window of  any cam-pus building.”CORRECTIONSFrom “Professor offers free legal advice”From “Student seeks to send policy up in smoke”Summer is offi cially over, but that doesn’t mean we have to stop enjoying the simple pleasures of  the sunny season. Sometimes hot cocoa and warm apple cider just won’t do the trick. For times like these, a smoothie is all I need to put me in a good mood.When searching for a drink of  the week, it didn’t take me very long to decide what to choose. I’m a big fan of  fruit smoothies, and I recently fell in love with a little-known Hawaiian drink called a POG.Typically the drink of  the week is an alcoholic bev-erage. Because of  my age detriment, however, I was left to choose something exciting, not well-known and non-alcoholic.I found the perfect drink at Ba-nana Crepe, a cute little shop adorned with toy monkeys located at 248 Jackson St. in Japantown. I had never heard of  a POG until I stum-bled upon one right here in San Jose.POG stands for pas-sion fruit, orange sherbet and guava. Those are the ingredients in the delicious concoction. It’s an unusual and uncommon drink that will take hold of  your taste buds and never let you forget it. It’s cool, revitalizing and light enough to accompany your lunch on the go.It’s bright orange and takes less than a minute to prepare. It’s inexpensive and far better than what you’d fi nd at Jamba Juice or any other chain smoothie shop.According to Banana Crepe owner Martie Suzuki, the POG originated in Hawaii. POGs are not easily found outside of  Hawaii.“We’re the only ones around,” Suzuki said.Order the Sydney’s POG at Banana Crepe and you’ll soon be savoring the sweet, smooth taste of  a refreshing smoothie.The drink is named Sydney’s POG be-cause that is the name of  the tester. When Suzuki was trying different combinations to make the perfect drink he recruited a young girl named Sydney to test the drink until he got it just right.Banana Crepe is within walking distance of  campus, and after a long day of  classes you can stroll over and re-energize yourself  with the POG smoothie.If  the word Pog sounds familiar, it may be because you’re thinking about the classic milk-cap game that was popular in the early ’90s.“The game was named after the drink,” Suzuki said.This fact alone boggled my mind. I had never heard of  such a thing and I had never questioned the origins of  the Pog game.The POG smoothie is a little piece of  history in a cup. Mmmm good.3THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2007THESPARTANDAILY.COM STUDENT LIFELEAH BIGELOW // SPARTAN DAILYAsqew Grill, located on South First Street, features several types of vegetarian and meat skewers, including the Thai barbecue chicken and peppercorn encrusted ahi on a Caesar salad, pictured above.restaurantreviewStaff  WriterBy LEAH BIGELOWStaff  WriterBy CODY HAUETERWhen you’re in the mood for a simple meal, stick to AsqewFrom Hawaiito Japan(town)The tropical POG is a smooth mix of fl avorTO DO THIS                           WEEKENDCheck out a preview of the 01SJ media arts festival at the San Jose City Hall rotunda.FRIDAY AT 8 P.M.drinkof  theweekAsqew sits slightly hidden on South First Street between San Carlos and San Fernando streets. Although only a few blocks off  campus, the eatery is located past Camera 12 Cinemas and Starbucks, two distractions that might keep students from ventur-ing too far from school.I must say, though, making the effort to visit Asqew is worth it. The food is delicious, with differ-ent fl avors and combinations to fi t anyone’s appetite, and the ser-vice is very welcoming. It is the perfect place to take a new date or meet up with the girls before a night on the town.When I fi rst entered the res-taurant, I immediately noticed how clean the place looks. The crisp white walls are accented by red lamps and picture frames, and the space is fi lled with Asian-inspired wooden tables and chairs.Asqew is rarely crowded, but I think that’s because few people have had the chance to discover the restaurant’s potential since its opening in January.The fi rst step when eating at Asqew is to give your order to the cashier. Actually, let me rephrase that. The fi rst step is staring at the large menu above the regis-ters for about 10 minutes, pon-dering over what to order.At fi rst glance, the menu might look confusing and a little daunting, but once you fi gure it out, you’ll still need another few minutes to settle on just one or two of  the yummy choices.To save time, and to keep you from drooling over the menu while your stomach growls im-patiently, here’s a breakdown on the ordering process:First, pick your skewers. These consist of  meat and veggies grilled to perfection and joined in the middle by a wooden stick. Ranging all the way from Texas barbecue to mango-lime sea bass, the variety of  skewers will appeal to almost any mood.The skewers come in two sizes: a half  order and a whole order. The whole order comes with two skewers, which can be mixed and matched with any of  the meat combinations, for those who are indecisive. Vegetarian skewer op-tions are also available, with the option of  tofu, portobello mush-rooms and seasonal vegetables instead of  meat.Once you pick your skewers, you have the option of  pairing them with a starch or a salad. Starches consist of  four choices: citrus cous cous, cilantro jasmine rice, mascarpone polenta and garlic mashed potatoes.For those who are trying to stay away from carbohydrates, the sal-ads are an excellent alternative, with choices such as the classic Caesar or the spicy Thai. The menu also offers a variety of  appetizers and sides, as well as baby back ribs or grilled chicken instead of, or in addition to, the skewers. Soups are also available, although options change daily. Some of  the regular choices, how-ever, are minestrone and New Eng-land clam chowder.I can personally vouch for the cilantro lime chicken and the Ca-jun chicken. Both come cooked with Roma tomatoes and red on-ions, although the Cajun chicken has a lot of  added spice. My skew-ers sat atop a fresh southwestern salad with mango salsa, cheddar-jack cheese and cilantro dressing. Talk about delicious.Although on the pricier side  — costs range between $7.50 and $10.50 — the excellent quality food is worth the extra cash.Meals can be paired with a fountain drink or, for those over 21 years old, the restaurant offers self-described choice beers and fi ne wines to make dinner an even fan-cier occasion.After placing your order, the ca-shier will hand you your drink and a marker to let the servers know where to bring your food. All that’s left is to fi nd a table until your meal comes. You usually won’t be kept waiting too long. Asqew is perfect for those will-ing to spend a little extra cash on a meal.CODY HAUETER // SPARTAN DAILYA Step ForwardAnnouncing one’s sexuality is not easy, especially inside a classroom.By MICHAEL RIZZOLast week, Kate Evans, an English department lecturer, made the decision. She told her fi ction writ-ing class that she’s a lesbian.Some of  her students said they could have guessed it. They’d already noticed that her written works of-ten involved gay characters and subject matter. But other students said they had no idea.People don’t really expect it from her, Evans said, probably because she’s “so straight looking.”And for most of  her life, Evans was straight. She was married to a man for 30 years.That was back when she taught high school. And back then, she said, mentioning her husband to her students was simply a way of  “humanizing” herself, showing them that she was a real person — but it’s not like that anymore.Now, mentioning her partner is her way of  mak-ing the decision to come out.“And I don’t want to censor myself,” she said, “be-cause I want to claim the same privileges I had when I was heterosexual.”The decision to come out on campus is one each teacher or staff  member has to make for themselves, Evans said. But she doesn’t fi nd the decision to be one that’s very hard.“For me, the benefi ts way outweigh the risks,” she said.Nowadays, California’s anti-discrimination laws prohibit college campuses, such as SJSU, from deny-ing individuals employment based on sexual orienta-tion.Those kinds of  policies weren’t around 40 years ago, though. And when counties such as Miami-Dade, Fla., in 1977, started to adopt them, they met with some fi erce opposition. Anita Bryant, then a singer and actress, led a campaign to demand that Miami-Dade overturn its legislation and throw homosexual teachers out of  public schools.The Washington Post wrote that Bryant gained celebrity for her belief  that homosexuals would start converting the children if  schools allowed them to be teachers. She rallied others to her cause and organized an activist group called Save Our Children.In June 1977, the Post reported on the type of  mes-sage Bryant and her followers were marketing:“In Miami, opponents of  the (gay rights) ordinanc-es, led by singer Anita Bryant, took out full-page news-paper ads saying that many parents are confused and perceive homosexuals to be gentle and non-aggressive. ‘The other side of  the homosexual coin is a hair-rais-ing pattern of  recruitment and outright seductions and molestation,’ the ad said.”Bryant put the national spotlight on gay rights, but her campaign ultimately failed.And it was in that same decade that Terry Chris-tensen, an SJSU professor in political science, was gradually coming to accept his sexuality, he said.“Coming to terms with myself  was the hard part — not coming out,” he said. “I regret it took so long. I could have had a lot more fun. This was in the ’70s. And there were a lot of  people who were more coura-geous than me.”Christensen has been teaching on this campus for 37 years. He said being out on campus has never re-ally been an issue with his colleagues or superiors.“I know sometimes things are said behind my back and I hear about it,” he said. “But that’s very rare.”Christensen’s students may or may not realize he’s gay. He said he doesn’t talk about himself  much in class. But it’s probably since his position is one of  au-thority, he also said, that he’s never really had confron-tations with students about his personal life.“Whatever students say among themselves or out-side of  class — they’re unlikely to confront a teacher,” he said.The Bay Area, however, is unique for its diversity and tolerance, Christensen said. And he might have been humming a whole different tune if, instead of  accepting his position at SJSU, he had opted for his other job offer — at University of  Wyoming in Laramie.That was before the murder of  Matthew Shep-herd, a gay student there, became national news in 1998. But Christensen said he was already aware that the town’s reputation for acceptance of  minorities was not so good.“I knew it was a small town,” he said. “Conser-Kate Evans, an English department lecturer, told her fi ction writing class that she is lesbian on Sept. 20, followed by an approxi-mately 20-minute long open-class discussion on the topic.HANNA THRASHER // SPARTAN DAILYTerry Christensen, a political science professor, has worked at SJSU for 37 years. Being out on campus has never really been an issue, he said.JASHONG KING // SPARTAN DAILY ARCHIVES (2004)continued on page 54 THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2007 THESPARTANDAILY.COMGOLD FOLDvative. Narrow. There were a lot of  racial issues with the football team.“It was a better job in terms of  money and workload, but I knew enough to know I wouldn’t be hap-py. It wasn’t a hard decision.”Refl ecting on those before him that had paved the way, Chris-tensen recalled two of  his heroes: Harvey Milk, the fi rst openly gay man elected to public offi ce in San Francisco, and then-mayor George Moscone. They struggled to achieve civil rights for gays and lesbians until an anti-gay conserva-tive assassinated both of  them on Nov. 27, 1978.According to a biography of  Milk published by Time magazine: “After he defi ed the governing class of  San Francisco in 1977 to be-come a member of  its board of  su-pervisors, many people — straight and gay — had to adjust to a new reality he embodied: that a gay person could live an honest life and succeed.”“It was a transitive moment for me when they were killed,” Chris-tensen said. “After that, you had to be out. It wasn’t acceptable to be in. It was a big wake up call for a lot of  people.”Richard Kelley, the director of  student involvement, said he’s al-ways been open about his sexuality at work.“I haven’t gone to a campus and just announced, ‘Hi, I’m gay,’” he said. “But, I’ve got rainbow stick-ers and everything else all over my car. Some people call it ‘the gay-mobile.’ But I don’t hide it. People know it.”One thing SJSU is lacking, Kelley said, is a queer center — a central campus hub for the student body, faculty and staff. It would be a safe haven for anyone who’s different in any way and let all passersby know that “we, as people, are part of  mainstream culture.”But the glue that’s been holding the SJSU gay community together for the last 40 years, Evans, Chris-tensen and Kelley all said, is Wiggsy Sivertsen, who teaches sociology and works as a faculty counselor. Kelley said she’s been fi ghting for the queer community on campus “forever.”In the beginning, Sivertsen said, she used to be criticized for how outspoken she was on gay rights, sometimes even by other homo-sexuals.When she fi rst started speaking up about the unfair dispersal of  benefi ts between married spouses and domestic partners, Sivertsen said “people’s eyes would roll in the back of  their heads.”Evans said it was “once Wiggsy got involved,” that the necessary changes were made so that gay couples were afforded the same benefi ts as straight couples.The campus “pit bull for gay rights,” as Kelley likes to call Si-vertsen, also helped establish the fi rst gay student organization.

You need to attack. Let’s go after these guys and fi nish this.”Ed Brand, one of  SJSU’s de-fensive players, suffered a devas-tating head butt to the face to-wards the end of  the fi rst period.He struck back at the Road-runners by kicking a penalty kick pass Bakersfi eld’s intimidating and most aggressive player, goalie Steve Trojanowski, at the 47:29 mark.Trojanowski’s anger got the best of  him at around the 80 min-ute mark when he clotheslined SJSU forward Colby Moore, but Moore was able to kick the ball into the net before being hit.SJSU’s players and staff  tried to get the referees to give Trojanowski a yellow card but they knew he was just playing his game.“He was doing what he had to do win,” said SJSU forward Ed-ward Murillo-Jimenez.The Roadrunners had a to-tal of  13 shot attempts, while the Spartan’s had 16. Both Tro-janowski and SJSU goalie Lewis Sweeney each had fi ve saves.The Spartan’s will play four straight home games, which they hope to win and help them secure a spot in the NCAA Men’s Col-lege Cup.“It feels good to play at home after playing fi ve straight games away,” Smare said. “We will have a successful season if  we con-tinue to play the way we played today.”Murillo-Jimenez agreed with Smare saying, “The support of  our fans will be very helpful for us these next for games. We are very excited and looking forward to our homestand.”The men’s soccer team’s next game will be against the College of  Charleston on Sept. 30 at 1 p.m.After thousands of  miles, four straight road games and a 1-3 start to the season, the travel weary SJSU football team will fi nally have a home game this weekend taking on UC Davis Saturday afternoon.The Spartans rebounded well from the dismantling at the hands of  Stanford University two weeks ago and played their best all-around game of  2007 last week, beating Utah State University 23-20.Demonstrating a resiliency most winless teams do not possess, the Spartans rallied late in the fourth quarter, overcoming a four-point defi cit and scoring the game-win-ning touchdown with 53 seconds left on the clock.In his weekly press conference, head coach Dick Tomey com-mended his team for the way they competed, saying, “it was the kind of  win that does your program more good than any other win you can imagine.”With all the negatives the team has endured over the early part of  the season, the team’s fi rst home game couldn’t have arrived at a better time.The come-from-behind victory could serve as the catalyst for turn-ing the season around.The Spartans now have some momentum heading into a stretch of  the season that includes three straight home games.The possibility is there for the Spartans to go undefeated during the home stand, which would put their record at 4-3 and all but erase their disappointing start.The third game of  the home stand is a nationally televised contest against the University of  Hawaii.The Warriors bring a potent offense led by Heisman Trophy hopefull Colt Brennen, but if  the Spartans can keep up against the high-fl ying Warrior offense it should be an exciting game, one that I think the Spartans have a chance of  winning.There is a sense that this year’s team has turned a corner, and they are right where they want to be. All of  the scattered, mixed-up and slightly bent pieces of  the puzzle are now coming together.Despite being outscored 136-40 the Spartan offense showed signs of  life last week posting 524 yards of  offense nearly doubling their season average of  273 per game.For the fi rst time, all fi ve offensive linemen, playing in their natural po-sitions started for the Spartans. The chemistry was obvious as they pro-ceeded to give up no sacks all game.“If  you don’t have pass pro-tection you don’t have a passing game,” Tomey said. “For us to throw it that many times and have no sacks is tremendous.”With a healthy offensive line, 6 THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2007 THESPARTANDAILY.COMSPORTSCan the last-minute victory over Utah State spark the Spartans’ season?SPARTAN DAILYDwight Bentel Hall, Room 209FAX:408.924.3282EMAIL: classified@casa.sjsu.eduONLINE:www.thespartandaily.comCLASSIFIED AD RATE INFORMATIONEach line averages 25 spaces.

JOE PROUDMAN // SPECIAL TO THE DAILY“Bakersfi eld played hard and we had to match their aggression in order to win the game.”RON SMAREAssociate Head Coach, men’s soccerStaff  WriterBy OSVALDO CASTILLO JR.Men’s soccer holds CSU Bakersfi eld scoreless in winFootball beat writer explores how the SJSU football team can carry its momentumquarterback Adam Tafralis had time to scan the fi eld, completing passes to seven different receivers on his way to a career-high 426 yards passing.His performance earned him Western Athletic Conference of-fensive player of  the week honors.Struggling to fi nd balance on of-fense through the fi rst three games, the Spartans accumulated 98 yards rushing against the Aggies, their highest output of  the season.The running game, hampered by injuries to senior running back Yonus Davis and his backup Pat-rick Perry, has been a work in progress all season.Davis is sidelined by an ankle in-jury and is expected to miss anoth-er game this week. Jacob French, who had 74 yards rushing a week ago, will have to continue to step in and fi ll the void.Looking ahead to this weekend’s game expect the offense to click once again. The UC Davis defense has allowed an average of  344 yards per game including a gaudy 246 through the air.Expect Tafralis to have another solid passing performance, spread-ing the ball around and fi nding his top two receivers, David Richmond and Kevin Jurovich, down fi eld for the big play.Not to be overshadowed is a quick and hard-hitting Spartan defense that includes WAC defensive player of  the week Jonathan Harris and leading tackler Demetrius Jones.Having forced fi ve turnovers through four games, the defense will look to stop a UC Davis offense that averages 418 yards per game.The Spartans now have some momentum heading into a stretch of the season that includes three straight home gamesFOOTBALL COMMENTARY:It’s something I can’t go a day without seeing. Some indie schmuck or boho-chic poser whining about how technology is becoming the “root of  all evil” and how as the world gets wired, the people get colder.What always gets me laughing is how they plead this case while pulling out a cell phone. Why? Because everyone has one.Technology, including texting, MySpace and e-mail, is not making the world impersonal. If  anything, it is only maintaining our level of  distance from one another. Last time I checked, using the telephone isn’t exactly an intimate form of  human contact. How is the ability to message someone on the Web somehow so much worse than talking to them from around the world on the telephone?I think what people forget about MySpace and other networking sites is that the ultimate objective to “friending” someone online is to eventually meet them in person. This is especially true in the world of  online dating.The era of  singles bars, wedding crashing or just plain luck with chance encounters is dead and gone, leaving in its place a more effi cient, possibly easier way to meet people. Now, instead of  cruising the scene and trying to fi nd a needle in a haystack, you can cut your time in half  by joining a dating site. While it certainly opens up the pool of  potentials, the screening process that comes with assessing a match may give you a better idea of  where to start.But this does not change the fact that even after you fi nd who you’re looking for, no amount of  technology will be able to aid you on an actual, real-life date. If  technology were truly hindering human connection and contact, the bars would be closed and wedding bells would never ring.Even where technology may be making interaction more impersonal, it is absolutely making it more effi cient.I have a boss whom I have only met three times in the year-and-a-half  I have been working for him. Rather than commute an hour to conduct business together, we correspond online. I applied for the job via e-mail. He assessed and hired me via e-mail.  Is this impersonal? You bet. Can you believe that I didn’t have to go to an interview where not only would my actual work and qualifi cations be judged, but also something as trivial as my wardrobe and appearance?Can you believe that I cut out all the formalities and went straight to the part where the big cheese said, “You’re hired”? How horrible!Internet communication, however, does not negate the need for people skills. In order to make connections, in any medium, you still have to know how to talk to people.In my case with the mystery employer, I had to write an e-mail fi t to charm and grab attention, just like speaking to someone in person. Just because I was using the Internet to make an impression, didn’t mean that said impression was impersonal.The Internet is not some magical tool that replaces the qualities you need to win people over. The only shortcut the Internet offers is with distance in miles, not in honing of  social skills.One of  my favorite albums of  all time is Dead Kennedys’ “Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death.” The title is a commentary on consumerism in America  — a commentary with which I actually agree. We can’t jump to conclusions, however, that everything that might make life a little more convenient is detrimental to society.Let’s not be so dramatic. If  anything, the gasoline we put in our cars to get us to someone’s doorstep is a little worse than a slight lack of  face time — in the big picture, that is.I’ll admit that I am attached at the hip to my laptop, fi guratively speaking, and my cell phone, which is often quite literally in my pants pocket. In fact, when I began writing this opinion piece, I was instant messaging a friend who lives in the same building, just one fl oor above me.Sure, we could have met each other in person. Instead, we hid behind “brb,” “lol” and “ttyl” and the emoticons that are supposed to convey happiness, annoyance and irony — “the Alanis Morissette sense of  the word” (as the opinion editor would say) or otherwise.While further developing this article, I bounced ideas off  at least a couple people and asked for their thoughts and suggestions. Neither the Internet nor batteries were used during the course of  these brainstorming sessions. I did it the old-fashioned way through good, old, face-to-face conversations.An emoticon cannot truly capture the complexity of  human emotions. Instead, it is better to experience these emotions while you’re in the moment. Nothing beats being in the presence of  other people: being able to actually reach out and touch them, seeing their faces and hearing the tone in their voices. That way you can tell whether they are being serious about what they’re saying to you or if  they really are “jk.”Technology is a big part of  society and people’s lives. Heck, we’re attending school in Silicon Valley. Thanks to the latest technology, it’s easy to instantaneously reach anyone, no matter his or her location, at anytime.But are we really connecting?Ever meet up with someone and tried to have a conversation, only to be interrupted by cell phone calls and text messages? Real life shouldn’t be put on hold.We’re living in a time when all you need are opposable thumbs and a cell phone to convey a message. If  you want to contact someone, there’s no need to contact him or her directly. There’s no need to talk to them at all. Conversations can be condensed down to an alphabet soup of  letters with numbers mixed in for additional spice.We’re living in a time when you can be friends with anyone, and I mean anyone. Take, for example, singer Justin Timberlake, who performed at the HP Pavilion on Sunday. Have you always wanted to meet Mr. SexyBack himself ? No need to go through the motions of  introductions and handshakes, nor sneak past the pesky security personnel. You can become one of  his friends on MySpace.However, you better get in line, pal. The last time I checked, Timberlake had 893,799 friends and counting.We’re living in a time when a person can be holed up in a room, sitting right in front of  a computer all day long, and yet have hundreds or even thousands of  MySpace “friends.” In fact, it can be downright competitive, comparing with your friends to see how many people are on their friends lists and who are the top eight on those lists.Making a new friend is just a click away. It’s so easy that it’s probably not a coincidence that a slang word for a person who spends a lot of  their time at that Web site, trying to get added to others’ friends lists, is a “MySpace whore.”Maintaining a meaningful relationship, though, may not be as effortless — and that’s the way it should be.Instead of  worrying about being on a person’s top eight friends list, focus on other things, such as having chats in a cafe (I’m not talking about online ones in an Internet cafe), traveling together, laughing together over a comedic movie or giving each other a hug during times of  sorrow and distress.In this technological age, we want things easy, fast and convenient. However, relationships aren’t like frozen dinners. Instead, they should be allowed to simmer and then savored over time, preferably in the presence of  good company.MySpace, texting, instant messaging ... is cellular and online socializing making our generation too impersonal?OPPOSING VIEWS        •        OPPOSING VIEWS         •         OPPOSING VIEWS        •        OPPOSING VIEWS         •         OPPOSING VIEWS        •        OPPOSING VIEWS   NO YESOPINION 7THESPARTANDAILY.COM THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2007If  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spoke at SJSU, would you listen?Would you skip your class? Would you tell your friends and encourage them to go?Would you attend the Iranian president’s opportunity to stand before a microphone? Would you sit under the bright lights of  the Morris Dailey Auditorium, maybe not sure of  what to expect, because Ahmadinejad hasn’t been afforded the same grandiose amount of  media attention as he was Monday? He was given the opportunity, partially, to speak at Columbia University amid much controversy within the school and by political fi gureheads elsewhere.Because this was Ahmadinejad’s fi rst visit to the United States to speak freely in the university setting, the media grabbed hold. Just as they should have.News is news is news.Ahmadinejad’s presence at Columbia on Monday brought me back to October of  last year — a time when Ahmadinejad was expected to speak there.But because of  Columbia’s “security and logistic confl icts,” Ahmadinejad was kept out of  the free-speech forum and the media bubble was burst.Only for a short time though, because replacing Ahmadinejad was Jim Gilchrist, leader of  the Minutemen— a group of  private individuals who monitor the U.S. border for illegal immigrants.This is where the debate of  free speech at Columbia gets sticky, the issue of  news coverage gets buried and I get concerned.With the details of  the content of  the Iranian leader’s speech left to quibble amongst your peers — let us examine free speech at Columbia and where some Americans’ ideas of  free speech in this country have gone awry.*** The so-called free speech privileges granted to Ahmadinejad on Monday were none of  the sort. Before being introduced, Columbia president Lee Bollinger said to Ahmadinejad, “Mr. President, you exhibit all the signs of  a petty and cruel dictator” and in his fi ery roasting added, “You are either brazenly provocative or astonishingly uneducated.”Search YouTube for this baffl ing representation of  our fi rst amendment — the choice by Bollinger, Columbia or what some criticized as “media pressure,” breached the very ideal this debate surrounds.If  we, as Americans, are going to cry out for free speech and the right to be heard, then let us do so. Let us not be barred, nor censored nor have our words spliced to fi t the allotted sound bite.The shoddy attack with which Bollinger prefaced Ahmadinejad’s tainted his practice of  free speech. Whether the leader should have even been allowed to speak is a complex argument compared to the inane decision to ruin what should have been a an infl uence-free time for Ahmadinejad.The time for debate, for question-and-answer time, is post-speech, not before. And even in the hypocrisy of  what occurred, the moderator still tried to corner Ahmadinejad into answering “yes” or “no” about remarks he made asking for the destruction of  Israel. The Iranian president answered, “You asked the question, and then you want the answer the way you want to hear it. Well, this isn’t really a free fl ow of  information.” And Ahmadinejad was right on point, as he fi nally answered “yes” to the moderator’s question.My opinion of  whether Ahmadinejad should freely express his opinions is indifferent in the context of  what actually occurred. The man did not speak freely as some headlines may have suggested and to return to Minutemen leader, Gilchrist, neither did he.Almost a year ago, Gilchrist went to Columbia to give a speech, which was organized by the university’s College Republican chapter.After a week of  protests, much like we saw surrounding Ahmadinejad’s presence, Gilchrist only got the chance to say four sentences. Protestors stormed the stage unrolling a banner, which said “No one is ever illegal” in several languages and chanted “Minutemen, Nazis, KKK! Racists, fascists, go away!” A fi ght ensued for 15 minutes between protestors and security guards on stage.Gilchrist — in the marketplace of  ideas, in the haven of  the fi rst amendment, with the American fl ag ceremoniously waving in the background — was censored.He was not asked to return to give his speech.And in a deja-vu like moment, Ahmadinejad’s “freedom” to use the university setting, which segued to the media coverage by thousands of  newspapers, TV news programs and blogs, was denied the right we hold so dearly.The opposition sees Ahmadinejad’s presence at Columbia and on American soil as giving legitimacy and recognition to a man who is responsible for the deaths of  Americans in Iraq and elsewhere, a denier of  the Holocaust and claims homosexuals do not exist in Iran.That debate is over. He came, he spoke and he left. What lingers is if  Bollinger’s remarks beforehand mired his boasting of  free speech on Columbia’s campus.The dean of  Columbia said before Ahmadinejad arrived that Adolf  Hitler would have been invited to speak at the university after the Holocaust.We all have the freedom to speak, but as the poor example at Columbia has shown, some have more freedom than others. To what degree your voice is heard is up to you — speak up, I’m listening.Lindsay Bryant is the Spartan Daily opinion editor. “Agree to Disagree” appears every Thursday.

He did his doctorate work in research physiology at UC Davis.The scattered laughter in the audience of  more than twenty kinesiology students faded with the click of  a Power Point slide as the research data was presented.In his presentation, Convertino said that the technol-ogy he helped research is designed to address an acute threat to life that occurs when blood pressure becomes extremely low, decreasing fl ow to the heart and brain.Matthew Masucci, kinesiology professor and advi-sor to the kinesiology student club, said that the re-search into impedance threshold devices is relevant to many kinesiology students.One student had doubts as to whether the presen-tation was relevant to him.“It’s not really my area of  study,” Tony Gianotti, a graduate student in sports management said. “It’s the same old tale of  having practical application for the research you do.”Another sports management graduate student, Det-rick Wright, was more receptive to the technology and research, but found the presentation confusing.“OK, but at what point do you use the device?” he said, explaining his confusion about how to use the impedance threshold device as part of  a ventilation device during CPR.The statistics on conditions involving decreased blood fl ow to the heart and brain, presented by Con-vertino, were grim.Convertino, said about 50 percent of  battlefi eld deaths are the result of  uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock.“Shock is the leading cause of  death for soldiers today,” he said.In addition, 40 to 50 percent of  astronauts suffer from orthostatic instability, a condition that results in fainting upon standing up.Convertino displayed a photograph of  a man in a blue NASA jumpsuit being lifted by two men onto a helicopter. He said that astronauts are still carried off  of  their space shuttles.The device attaches to a normal respirator mask and provides an increased amount of  blood to the heart and brain during assisted ventilation. Convertino pointed out that the device is non-invasive, requires no drugs and is compact, weighing less than 150 grams.“It’s a small cube and it’s inexpensive,” he said. “The Army likes this.”The kinesiology student club arranged the presen-tation as part of  a series of  talks throughout the se-mester, Masucci said.“We try to provide the best info for a variety of  disciplines,” he added.Peggy Plato, a kinesiology professor who also helped in getting Convertino to speak on campus, said that many kinesiology courses such as sports physiol-ogy and research physiology have medical elements.“Kinesiology studies human motion,” she said, “so there’s defi nitely a relation.”Convertino said that the device is currently out of  prototype stage and can be purchased. The propri-etary model is called the ResQPOD and patented by Advanced Circulatory Systems, Inc.He added that the devices are being adopted by hospitals, but are not yet ubiquitous.“They’re the getting the word out,” he said.According to Convertino, NASA utilizes imped-ance threshold devices on their shuttles. The military is still trying to decide how to issue the device to sol-diers in the fi eld.“I’ve heard some guys say it should be in every sol-dier’s medical kit,” he said.Near the end of  his presentation, Convertino dis-played his transcription of  a letter he received from a lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps serving as chief  of  emergency medical and primary care in the 228th Combat Support Hospital. In his letter, Lt. Col. Bruce Adams cites the impedance threshold device as a key element in the survival of  a patient in a shock state with a gunshot wound to the pelvis.“Getting mail like this makes it all worthwhile,” Convertino said.Staff  WriterBy MARK ASPILLERASJSU alumnus creates lifesaving deviceThe College of  Engineering will hold a naming ceremony to-day at 4:30 p.m. in honor of  a $15 million endowment bestowed by former SJSU graduate Charles W. Davidson last May.The endowment is the largest private individual gift in the history of  the university, according to Joy Leighton, the director of  communi-cations in the college.Belle Wei, dean of  the newly titled Charles W. Davidson College of  Engineering, said that she is very excited about the naming cer-emony and that the endowment is “a gift to transform the college.”Stephen D’Esterhazy, a senior chemical engineering major, said, “It’s always nice to fi nd former stu-dents who do well in the industry to come back and help out with bettering their former colleges.”He also added that he hopes the money will also go toward new equipment.“I know some of  our equipment is almost 30 years old,” he said.An Oklahoma native, David-son moved to San Jose in 1952 and graduated from SJSU with a degree in civil engineering in 1957. Along with creating his own private civil engineering fi rm, he was also a real estate developer and started fi ve companies, in-cluding DKB Homes, a Bay Area home development company, ac-cording to a news release from the College of  Engineering.The ceremony will include speeches from President Don Kass-ing, Dean Wei and Davidson.Lina Melkonian, director of  development in the Charles W. Davidson College of  Engineering said, “This is an incredible gift, not only to the College of  Engineer-ing, but to San Jose State Univer-sity. It’s a vote of  confi dence from Mr. Davidson that San Jose State continues to be a vibrant institu-tion. We are very excited to have him as our philanthropist.”Melkonian said, “It’s really critical that however way we use these funds, it is targeted toward retaining and educating top tech-nology professionals.”Wei said that some of  the fund-ing will be going toward a new freshman engineering course in which students would do a variety of  energy projects.Ping Hsu, associate dean of  un-dergraduate studies, said, “Mr. Da-vidson’s endowment allows us to do things we wanted to do when the re-sources were not there, and this will allow us to really provide the best education we can for our students.”Melkonian emphasized that the ceremony is open to the entire university and not only to those in the college.“We believe this gift is fi rst and foremost to the university, so the campus community is certainly invited to attend and be witness to the dedication and join the cel-ebration,” she said.She said that the college is excit-ed about Davidson’s endowment, and added, “San Jose State Uni-versity is making a very conscious effort in moving forward, and these kinds of  gifts will defi ne how well we embrace the future. We consid-er this an incredible leadership gift from Mr. Davidson and hope that others will follow in his footsteps.”Published in the release is a quote from Davidson, stating, “I don’t believe the money I have earned is wholly mine. Providence has allowed me to be the manag-er and trustee of  this money, and philanthropy comes with that re-sponsibility — taking care of  your employees, your business partners, your family and your community.”The ceremony will be held in the southeast corner of  the Engi-neering Building.
