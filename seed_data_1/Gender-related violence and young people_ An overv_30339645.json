Cross-national comparison of legal texts can illustrate the benefits of framing issues ofviolence/gender/youth in certain ways and offer critical reflection on particular legal frameworks or cul-tural understandings. This policy review is based on an analysis of select laws regarding gender-relatedviolence (GRV) as relates to young people in Italy, Ireland, Spain and the UK. Here, GRV is defined assexist, sexualising or norm-driven bullying, harassment, discrimination or violence whoever is targeted.It therefore includes gender, sexuality and sex-gender normativities, as well as violence against womenand girls. A tension emerges between granting young people agency and recognising the multiple, inter-secting power relations that might limit and shape that agency. This article draws out the implicationsfor the UK in particular, highlighting the absence of preventative measures and the need for a broaderapproach to combat GRV. © 2015 The Authors. Children & Society published by National Children’sBureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Keywords: gender, young people, gender related violence, sexual exploitation, sexual agency,law.Introduction: This review and its purposeThis policy review draws on a mapping of policy on gender-related violence (GRV) in fourEuropean countries (Biglia, Olivella-Quintana, and Cagliero, in press).1 The review wasundertaken to develop a new training project (Alldred and David, 2014)2 which sought tosupport professionals in England (UK), Italy, Ireland and Catalonia (Spain), who have every-day contact with general populations of children and young people (‘youth practitioners’) tobetter: recognise GRV; intervene to challenge it (and the values that underpin it); and referthose individuals affected by violence to appropriate services.3 The project adopted a broaddefinition of ‘GRV’ as sexist, sexualising or norm-driven bullying, harassment, discriminationor violence whoever is targeted. The definition therefore encompasses violence against womenand girls (VAWG) and homophobic and transphobic violence, and saw gender inequality andthe gender order (gender norms and the binary system itself) as at the core of each of thesetypes of violence.4The four countries analysed have in common the European Union (EU) equalities andinternational (United Nations) human rights frameworks. However, discussion in ourinternational research meetings suggested diversity in legal concepts and their usage. Theassumption was that the commonality and dialogue between these Western European states,despite their heterogeneity, make comparison intelligible and helpful: an approach to legalprotection for young people in relation to GRV in one country might offer suggestions forgood practice in another.CHILDREN & SOCIETY VOLUME 29, (2015) pp. 662–675DOI:10.1111/chso.12141 POLICY REVIEW© 2015 The Authors.

Nevertheless, to consider how young people are served by the law around GRV the start-ing point was to examine how the law dealt with inequality, discrimination and violence inrelation to gender and sexuality generally and how gender relations are recognised by law.This review first considers the approaches taken in the legal frameworks around GRV, andthen explores how young people are served by these, at least in theory. It is based on a lin-guistic/content analysis of legal texts for what they convey about the politics of these issuesin different locations, rather than in a study of their legal functioning (which would indeedbe valuable). After interviewing key experts,5 a limited number of legal documents wereidentified as relevant to the broad concept of GRV because they addressed discriminationand/or violence based on sex (gender) roles and norms or sexual orientation.6 In the Spanishcontext, those of the region in which the project was developed (Catalonia) were also anal-ysed, and for the UK, the focus was on UK-wide legislation as this was most relevant forpractitioners based in England (despite the four countries that make up the UK having theirown legislatures for devolved matters). Table 1 below, lists the legal documents reviewedand their code when used in this review. An initial analysis painted the broad picture atnational/regional level, then a content analysis of ‘substantive, operative and symbolicdimensions’7 was conducted of specific pieces of legislation (indicated in bold in the table).Symbolic dimensions included the terminology, the definition of the problem/s, whether agender-neutral or gender-sensitive (specifically recognising the potential for gendereddynamics of power) approach is employed, the agency attributed and the degree to whichintersectionality was recognised.The emergence of GRV legislation in four EU statesThe EU’s commitment to gender equality (and women’s rights), and sexual orientationequality (and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and intersex [LGBTI] rights), is seen inmultiple soft policies that do not have the legal status of Directives, but nevertheless impacton Member States (F\u0001abi\u0001an, 2010; Krizsan and Popa, 2010; Montoya, 2009; Tak\u0001acs, 2006).Therefore for Ireland, it was entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973,combined with the economic growth of the 1980s and pressure from feminists, opened upspace for progressive equality agendas (Equality Authority, 2012; Nash, 2013). For the UKtoo, gender equality rights were formalised, particularly in employment, equal opportunitiesand the creation of new equality institutions, after joining the EEC the same year (Bashevkin,1996; Millns and Skeet, 2013). For Spain, it was not until democracy in 1977 that a rapidshift towards European norms began (Dema, 2008), with the modification of the fascist legalframework and implementation of a Constitution.More specifically in relation to GRV, during the 1960s and 1970s, second wave feministmovements fought to get VAW on the political agenda in England (Harwin, 2006), Italy(Creazzo, 2008) and Ireland (Connolly, 2002). The first law in any of these countries, thatenabled women— whether married or not — to get protection from violence, was the English(and Wales) Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act in 1976 (Harwin, 2006). Afew years later, protection against some forms of GRV was first addressed in Italy with a 1981law that abolished the euphemistically named ‘rehabilitating marriage’ (of a man to a womanhe had previously raped) and recognised the possibility of sexual violence within marriage.Gender-Related Violence and Young People 663© 2015 The Authors.

Children & Society published by National Children’s Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. CHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 29, 662–675 (2015)In Ireland, Mary Robinson’s Presidency raised the profile of VAW (Kearns and others,2008) leading to the approval of the Irish Domestic Violence Act in 1996. In Spain, feministactivism just after the dictatorship focused on reclaiming rights lost under Franco and oncombating rape and sexual abuse (L\u0001opez and others, 2007). Twenty years later, in 1999, theSpanish Penal Code was finally modified to expressly protect victims of domestic violence.In the same year, but with notable delays in some Member States, EU-level debate firstaddressed VAW as a human rights issue, then as a health problem, and finally targeted ‘vio-lence against children, young person and women’ together (Lombardo and Maier, 2007).Sexual orientation equality has taken longer to work through into national law, butpressure from Europe (which first included non-discrimination for sexual minorities in theAmsterdam Treaty of 1997) helped produce a landscape that has eventually largely equalisedLGB rights with those for heterosexuals. The first inclusion of this protection from discrimi-nation is in the 1995 Spanish Penal Code. It was then more comprehensively addressed inthe 1998 Irish Employment Equality Act, in 2003 Spanish legislation and in the UK’s 2010Equality Act.8 Italy is the only country where, despite a strong LGB/LGBTI movement, it hasnot yet been possible to achieve equality, and protection from discrimination only applies inthe workplace. Same-sex marriage became legal in Spain in 20059 (civil union having beenrecognised in regions such as Catalonia since 1998), the same year that the UK recognisedcivil partnerships. In England and Wales same-sex marriages have had full status since 2014and the 2015 Irish referendum will guarantee this status too. Only Italy does not grant thisright, although same-sex civil unions are gaining recognition this year. However in Italy, likein the UK and Spain, gender reassignment is recognised, whilst it is forbidden in Ireland.The law on GRVThere is no comprehensive coverage of GRV by EU Directive; however, there is a convention,sponsored by the Council of Europe that aims to prevent violence, prosecute perpetrators andprotect women from all forms of violence. To date, of these countries, only Italy and Spainhave ratified it, while the UK has only signed, and Ireland has not even signed it.10 One formof GRV on which the EU explicitly legislated is sexual abuse/exploitation and child pornog-raphy. This problem is nationally regulated by penal law characterised by gender neutrality,with the same approach used in relation to forced marriage in UK and trafficking in Italy.This gender neutrality might have seemed a progressive step for UK policy in the 1990s (All-dred, 1999) — and is essential post-Equalities Act (2010), but it means that the law cannottake into account gendered relations of power in either the diagnosis nor the prognosis ofthe problem.11 The only legislation in which, for obvious reasons, the ‘victim’ is gendered inall countries is those relating to protection from, and punishment of those conducting,female genital mutilation. Moreover, GRV is often included in national legislation that tack-les different kinds of violence, and are therefore not able to attend the specificity of GRV(and see Furness and Ganzle (2012) and Gerard and Pickering (2014) on the use of genderviolence for ‘security’ ends).While the concept of domestic violence, frequently associated with GRV, is common inBritish and Irish legislation, it appears only occasionally in Italian or Spanish legislation,and is not necessarily gender-sensitive. In the laws examined, offender and victim aredescribed in gender-neutral terms and there is no mention of possible unequal power rela-tions in the home. Concern with dynamics of power linked to gender may appear in practice(not the focus of our analysis), rather than in legislation. For instance in the UK, there is anexplicit reference to ‘controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour’ in the governmentdefinition of ‘domestic violence and abuse’ (Rights of Women 2014). Therefore in some666 Pam Alldred and Barbara Biglia© 2015 The Authors. Children & Society published by National Children’s Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. CHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 29, 662–675 (2015)countries, legal practice relies on policy that lacks the full status of law, a point we return tolater.Spain is the only country analysed that has specific (national and regional) laws entirelyconcerned with GRV framed as a social and cultural problem relating to the construction ofgender and associated power relations. Although the diagnosis of the problem is clearly gen-der-sensitive, the legal remedies offered fall back into constructing GRV as violence exer-cised by a man in relation to a woman partner, with a slightly wider understanding of it inthe Catalan legislation (Biglia and others, 2014).The Spanish/Catalan laws on GRV are also the only ones that include considerable preven-tive measures,12 for instance, stipulating ‘promoting research on GRV’, asserting that profes-sionals involved in GRV-related processes (health workers, police, lawyers, schools), tradeunions and employers must be trained; that schools/universities must provide comprehensivetraining for trainee teachers to combat sexism; and requiring companies applying for gov-ernment grants to indicate their means to prevent, detect and intervene in workplace genderdiscrimination/violence. This preventative angle is absent from UK and Italian legislation,and Irish law addresses prevention only in broad terms, specifying institutional figures withresponsibility for prevention, but without associated powers or strategies.Spanish and Italian legislation provides less protection from GRV for those in same-sexrelationships, while, in the UK and Ireland, LGTBI individuals are protected either becausethe laws explicitly apply to people in same-sex relationships, or because gender neutralityallows the inclusion of same-sex relationships or behaviour. In these countries, this protec-tion is also included in equality law in line with EU legislation, while in Italy this is only thecase if the discrimination occurs within the labour market. In Spain, there is no national lawrecognising homo/lesbo/trans-discrimination, but Catalonia is one of the regions setting pro-gressive standards for this.Legislation analysed in all four countries, fails to recognise the experience of gender vio-lence as intersecting with race, class, age, ability, social status, etc.), and in many cases, lacksawareness of multiple discrimination too. However, we can trace an incipient multi-discrimi-nation approach in Ireland that recognises that different forms of discrimination might oper-ate simultaneously. Nonetheless, the apparent neutrality of the law fails to recognise thatdiscrimination might impact differently on subjects according to their location in otherstructures of privilege and power. In fact, even when specific groups are identified as facingdiscrimination (e.g. when it specifies a person with a disability, member of the TravellerCommunity, etc.), there is no consideration of the particular needs they might have.13 Cata-lan legislation differs slightly in suggesting that particular care should be taken with respectto ‘LGBTI people, who can face multiple discrimination, to avoid situations of vulnerability’.However, it does not explain how multiple discrimination may operate, and simplyemphasises the needs of this group, which risks reinforcing the image of ’the tragic gay’(Monk, 2011).Young people in legislation on GRVYoung people as a constituencyMany different terms are used to describe young people14 in the EU legislation analysed. Themost common is ‘child/children’ (not specified by age in EU-CFR), but defined as any personbelow the age of 18 in penal law (EU-SEXABU and EU-VCRIME). This is also the most com-mon usage in UK law, while in UK-DV, child refers to a person under 16 years, because 16-and 17-year-olds can be seen as experiencing violence in their own interpersonal or sexualrelationships. The UK-Sex is more precise a tool than the EU law in the way it applies differ-Gender-Related Violence and Young People 667© 2015 The Authors. Children & Society published by National Children’s Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. CHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 29, 662–675 (2015)ent penalties for sexual activity with children under 13 and under 16, but in other respects itretains the usual notion of ‘children or young people’ as under 18s. This latter definitionapplies to the Irish legislation too, with one specific and interesting exception: a child isunderstood as ‘a person under the age of 18 other than a person who is or has been married’.The child’s right to protection is rescinded when marrying, presumably because a spousethen assumes from the state the role of protector.The Italian GRV legislation gives young people no special attention. The only reference tothem appears with the use of ‘minors’ to include them in the category of those who might bevictimised/offended against. This illustrates the invisibilisation of young people as legalsubjects. The concept of minor, not precisely defined in most jurisdictions, means below theage of majority or adulthood, although it can be used more specifically as people below aparticular age-defined right (e.g. of criminal responsibility, of consent, of compulsory schoolattendance) or at which legally binding contracts can be entered into, and each of these maydiffer. The use of this term, also adopted in some EU and Spanish legislation, underscorestheir position as subjects without full rights.The terms mentioned above are ungendered, and the term ‘girls’ is only rarely used inlaw, having one specific, prominent usage in legislation on genital mutilation and to identifya group with special needs in Spanish equality law. Some Catalan legislation, to differentiatefrom most Spanish GRV law that does not specifically refer to young people, specifies thatthe law is also valid for ‘girls and adolescents’. It is interesting that it makes the point ofspecifying girls even though the Spanish plural masculine term for teenagers (‘adolescents’)is also gender-neutral. As this legislation is not gender-neutral, specifying women/girls asvictims and men as offenders and then referring to young people, the purpose of this curiousformulation is to recognise that boys can also be victims.The only real example of the law differentiating between boys and girls is a specific gen-der exclusion found in the Irish legislation, whereby girls under the age of 17, unlike theirmale peers, cannot be found guilty for simply engaging in a sexual relationship with aminor. This might be taken to indicate recognition of likely gendered and other powerdynamics. However, it might be instituting heterosexist assumptions about who that sexualrelationship is with, be reproducing the assumption of an active sexuality and desire for boysthat is not assumed for girls, or be otherwise failing to recognise potential abuses of powerthat might not follow dominant gendered patterns. This illustrates the genuine dilemma ofgender-specificity or neutrality.Victims and perpetrators, ‘needs’ and agencyIn the laws examined children and young people are mostly viewed as a vulnerable group(e.g. EU-PROT, Sp-VdG, Sp-IG) that deserve special protection, or as a specific group ofpotential victims, who might experience violence (EU-VAW). In particular, the Irish legisla-tion appears to frequently associate the term ‘victim’ with children, as the ‘victim’ of: sexualabuse, domestic violence or female genital mutilation. The critique of the term ‘victim’ forconstructing a passive subject has led to the preferred adoption among feminists and serviceproviders of ‘survivor’ (Radford and Russell, 1992), but this is rarely, if ever, applied tochildren. EU, Italian15 and Spanish law attends to children as sons or daughters of violentrelatives which also risks constructing them as passive, especially as witnesses of violence inthe home.16On the other hand, children are rarely explicitly described as possible perpetrators of vio-lence, for example in sexual violence legislation in Italy and Ireland. The Spanish Penal Codedoes not explicitly recognise that a child could be an offender, but notes that they are likely668 Pam Alldred and Barbara Biglia© 2015 The Authors. Children & Society published by National Children’s Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. CHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 29, 662–675 (2015)to have fewer ‘penal responsibilities and obligations’ (and will be sentenced less harshly),and so we can assume that they are recognised as potential offenders.Children’s rights are specifically protected in the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights,which also prohibits child labour and establishes young people’s rights as workers. There issome recognition that young people might experience age discrimination: in EU legislation,being young is viewed as a risk factor for discrimination that should be recognised and pre-vented (EU-EQ2000), and this specific vulnerability is also acknowledged by Irish and Italianequalities laws and in the UK-Fam and UK-DV when explaining the role of youth courts.However in the UK, only over 18s are given full legal protection from unlawful age discrimi-nation; under-18s are only protected against age discrimination in relation to work, althoughthey are covered in relation to other forms of discrimination (Children’s Rights Alliance forEngland, n.d.). For Catalonia, it is specified that culture, leisure and sports services for youngpeople must avoid discriminating against LGTBI people, and that young people who aremade homeless must be supported by social, and where relevant, specific LGTBI servicesWhile the EU recommends a child-sensitive approach and that young people are informedabout the specific protections available to them (EU-VCRIM, Art. 1), this does not appear tolead to full recognition of young people’s agency in Member States. Limited or specific ver-sions of agency are evident in the fact that, say, in UK law children can report a crime atany age, have right to express their views freely, but in the other legislation analysed herethere were no other cases of this. The principle — of granting young people subject status— is compromised by the fact that young people cannot take decisions on some of theimportant issues in their lives and that their age still limits what they can and cannot do.For instance, people under 18 do not have the right to be recognised as their preferredgender when this is possible for adults in the UK.One specific area in which the law might be examined to consider whether young people’sagency is recognised is in terms of an autonomous sexuality. The recognition of agency inthe sexual sphere might be asking something more of Western societies than, say, in relationto decision making in matters of residency in the case of parents who are separating, inwhich it might be more readily accepted that their views ought to be heard (‘on matters thataffect them’, UK Children Act 1989) (e.g. UK-Fam). Sexuality might constitute a special case,but it seems that an impressively nuanced picture of young people’s agency is developed, forinstance, in the UK. While the age of consent is 16 for intercourse with a heterosexual orsame-sex partner (UK-Sex), the law grants some agency to young people recognising thatnot all sex among 13- to 15-year-olds is non-consensual. It therefore penalises less harshly‘sexual activity with a child’ (i.e. under 16 years old), where there is no suggestion by anyparty that it is non-consensual (although that sexual activity is still against the law) and soallows a judgement to be made about whether there is exploitation or only underage sexinvolved for 13- to 15-year-olds. Thus, 13-year-olds and above are granted some agencyand a degree of autonomous sexuality: they are generally considered able to consent to sexalthough that sex is not legal (Rights of Women 2014).The same pattern applies in other countries. While the age at which sexual consent is law-ful varies between Italy, Ireland, Spain and the UK (at 14, 17, 16 and 16 years respectively),they each have some form of ‘close in age exception’ and tiers of offence (e.g. Ireland has‘defilement of a child under 17’ and ‘defilement of a child under 15’, with harsher penaltiesfor the latter). In Spain, the age of consent was 13 until 2015, and new legislation allowspeople below the age of 16 to consent to sex with someone close in age or (a vaguelydefined) close in ‘development or maturity’, as judged by a court. Similarly for Italy, under13s cannot give consent, but sex with consenting 13- and 14-year-olds by someone no morethan 3 years older is not punishable (but the agency of the 13/14-year-old is not recognised)Gender-Related Violence and Young People 669© 2015 The Authors. Children & Society published by National Children’s Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. CHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 29, 662–675 (2015)and from 14, young people are seen as agents in their sexual relationships. Three of the fourcountries raise the age of consent if someone is in a position of authority, trust or influenceover the young person (to 16 for Italy and to 18 for Spain and the UK) and Ireland increasesthe penalties in this case. This suggests that where the law does not explicitly recognisegendered power differentials, it recognises other forms of power and here specifies status/roleand age differentials. These are a welcome attempt, but ‘close in age’ is perhaps clumsierthan requiring that the power dynamics in a specific context ought to be considered. Ineffect, a fixed form of intersectionality of age and power is being attempted here.DiscussionThe complexity of cross-cultural comparison, perhaps particularly regarding something asculturally embedded and interwoven as law, alert us to the limitations of attempting toexplain the differences we see. Instead we stick to describing them and reflecting on the con-structs, discourses or political framing they offer, as a way of trying to see more criticallythe legal framework we speak within or identifying more progressive legal strategies.However, as the discussion above of current definitions of domestic violence and abuse inthe UK illustrates, the comparison of law between countries is problematic because whatsome countries resolve in law, others address in policy. The result in terms of legal outcomesmight be the same, or might not, but legal practice must be studied by means other than thetextual analysis of laws although analysis of the laws themselves can reveal the conditionsof possibility for the law and its practice (Krizsan and others, 2007).Gender tends not to be acknowledged in policy concerned with adults, and policy regard-ing children and young people even more regularly fails to acknowledge it (Firmin, 2014).Like previous research, we find that the EU and its Member States (with the exception ofSpain) ‘mainly treat domestic violence as a human rights, criminal justice or public healthissue and rarely a specific gender equality problem’ (Krizsan and others, 2007: 164). Forexample, the EU, UK, Irish and Italian legislation reviewed uses gender-neutral language.This strategy is justified in the name of equality, but, as previously mentioned, prioritisingthe treatment of all people equally means avoiding mention of diversity or power relations.Unsurprising though, there are mixed consequences of gender neutrality (e.g. Alldred, 1999;Krizsan and Popa, 2010). On the one hand, it can be a barrier to improving responses forgang-associated women and girls (Firmin, 2014) and can hide the tendency for violence inpeer relationships to have a harsher impact on girls than boys (Barter and others, 2015). Onthe other hand, overlooking diversity paradoxically meant that the LGBT communityreceived more protection because gender neutrality allowed the inclusion of same-sex cou-ples before the law explicitly asserted this, as happened in the UK. However, those who bestmeet popular imaginaries of subject and relationship ideals (i.e. White, able-bodied, finan-cially solvent or otherwise privileged subjects and monogamous romantic couples) mightmost easily benefit from the legal recognition of same-sex relationships. Thus, gender-neu-tral language might aim to be inclusive and does helpfully avoid essentialising, but is limitedin helping to think through intersectionality, inequality and differential power in all itscomplex detail.Our view is that the legislation examined does not deal with GRV in a comprehensiveway. It is mainly treated as an individualised matter, and as occurring only in the privatesphere, so legislation frequently misses important structural and normalised cultural forms ofviolence. Moreover, while Spanish and Catalan laws are the most feminist/gender-sensitive,there is the issue of whether strong statements in law translate effectively into practice(Biglia and Olivella-Quintana, 2014). Only in documents focused on rights — or in the Span-ish and Catalan legislation — does the understanding of GRV extend beyond the private670 Pam Alldred and Barbara Biglia© 2015 The Authors. Children & Society published by National Children’s Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. CHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 29, 662–675 (2015)sphere to directly tackle public institutions and services. For children and young people, theunderstanding of GRV as more than an individual family problem is vital, as what happensat home may constitute an umproblematised norm for young people or something privateand shameful to cover up. Similarly, an understanding of GRV as systemic makes it politicaland offers a far stronger tool for problematising specific incidents themselves. It is onlywhen young people link together the incidents they may experience that they are likely toidentify a political problem or critique the power relations around them. Therefore, thisbroader understanding is necessary to promote and support other efforts to achieve the socialchange that is needed.Overall, the Italian and Irish legislation examined for this review tends to treat youngpeople as special subjects whose vulnerability is key (although admittedly the Italian sexualconsent law grants greater agency), while the UK tends to grant more agency and there isgreater inclusion of young people in anti-discrimination law. In terms of the coverage ofyoung people by GRV legislation it is perhaps unsurprising that this review finds a tensionbetween the aim of protection, which has dominated the law concerning children in Europefor the past century, and that of empowerment, a relatively recent concern associated withcivil rights frameworks in the West (Archard and Macleod, 2002; Jenks, 2004). Scholars havedescribed these two discourses that frame understandings of youth and the points at whichempowerment and protection may conflict. Legislation on violence, sexual abuse and dis-crimination clearly must protect young people, yet without disempowering them. It needs to‘support’, ‘defend’ and ‘enable them to access protection’ — terms that recognise agencymore than does ‘protection’.If this protection/empowerment tension regarding children and young people is a generalissue, and the dilemma of dependency versus autonomy has broadly framed the developmentof laws concerning children (Archard and Macleod, 2002) and Western childhoods generally(Burman, 2007), then issues of sexuality might intensify this. Indeed the UK age of consentamendment discussion in 2001 saw positions polarise according to this tension, as children’scharities foregrounded protectionist discourses which allied them with religious groups(against an equal age of sexual consent for same-sexual and heterosexual activity) and youthorganisations foregrounded an empowerment argument, aligning with the equality lobby(Waites, 2005). The former tended to present under 18s as ‘children’, non-sexual and as pas-sive victims of the sexualities of abusive adults, versus an account of young people as poten-tially sexual themselves, whose autonomous sexualities (and thus perhaps practices) mightnot always be problematic. Thus, the distinction between children and young people is piv-otal, rhetorically, if not legally. The provision of comprehensive sex and relationship educa-tion similarly rests on seeing young people as sexual subjects (Allen, 2005), although aprotectionist argument could support a minimal sex education in order that children canrecognise and report sexual exploitation (Alldred and David, 2007). Young people do notneed to be denied an autonomous sexuality to be spared being culpable for their abuse(Kitzinger, 1988). Agency should not be pitted against innocence.This in turn is a version of a wider cultural phenomena: the dilemma about whether toaddress children as citizens, which can leave them largely invisible in an adult-centric world,or to highlight their special status, which usually means constructing them as vulnerable,dependent and passive (Jenks, 2004). Accounts that attempt to recognise children’s agency,and present them as adept cultural actors, risk presenting them as ‘little aliens’ (James andothers, 1998) and emphasising their Otherness. However, a broader framework that allowsfor different types of difference, including age (child–adult status) would meet these andother calls for intersectionality to be recognised.Gender-Related Violence and Young People 671© 2015 The Authors. Children & Society published by National Children’s Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd. CHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 29, 662–675 (2015)The granting of subjecthood means that the law must address children or young people ashaving agency in relation to sexual activity, criminal activity or violence — and also interms of their compliance with the law or legal process. Logically, the law needs to addressthem as not only victims but also as potential perpetrators of violence. Doing so while allow-ing for the weight of power and responsibility in the majority of cases is the challenge, butit is a challenge that needs meeting to properly recognise young people’s abuse by theirpeers (Barter, 2011), as well as by adults.The recognition that violence among adults frequently has a gendered dimension needsexplicit recognition in law before it can be carried through to consideration of children andyoung people. Similarly the legal framework needs to recognise other dimensions of power inthe emergence of violence and its impact. In addition young people should be positioned inlegislation as active in the dismantling of GRV. Therefore, ‘child-sensitive’ (or better still, child-centred) educative and preventive measures should be included in the legislation. More effort isneeded to involve young people in the policy process as ‘the right to have a voice in the fram-ing of a policy issue is connected strictly to matters of power, and related to the actual inclu-sion or exclusion of actors in/from the political debate’ (Verloo and Lombardo, 2007: 27).Research demonstrating that adults live gendered lives tends to give more emphasis totheir active involvement in, and individual agency in relation to the reproduction of genderthan does research evidencing that children live gendered lives (Firmin, 2014). While chil-dren and young people are understood as distinctly different from adults, their inclusion inanti-violence measures will be tenuous. This special case status also inhibits their automaticinclusion in equalities provision. Not always being granted a sexual identity sadly does notprotect young people from abuse on the basis of their (actual or perceived) sexual orientationor gender identity. Perhaps we cannot hope to have legislation that fully addresses GRV inthe lives of young people until it is fully addressed in the lives of adults. Or perhaps, when itcomes to sexuality there is a greater challenge to ensure that the dimension of age (youth) isnot neglected even once other dimensions of power are recognised.Notes1 Barbara Biglia coordinated the review, while Maria Olivella analysed the EU, UK, Irish andSpanish legislation and Sara Cagliero, the Italian legislation.2 Supported by the EU’s Daphne-III Programme, ‘GAP Work: Improving gender-related vio-lence intervention and referral through youth practitioner training’ (JUST/2012/DAP/AG/3176).

CHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 29, 662–675 (2015)7 Adapting the IGOP (Institute of Government and Public Policies, Universidad AutonomaBarcelona, Spain) model (e.g. Adelantado and others, 2013).8 This was the first UK comprehensive anti-discrimination law although there were slightlyearlier protections on specific issues (e.g. lifting the ban on serving in the military in 2000,equalising the age of consent 2001, protection from discrimination in the workplace in 2003;Civil Partnership Act 2004).9 The third country in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry, after the Netherlandsand Belgium.10 At 31/05/2015 this remains the case, meaning the UK agrees in principle but that neitherthe UK or Ireland can be held to the terms of the treaty (http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&CM=&DF=&CL=ENG).11 We adopt the concepts of diagnosis and prognosis of Critical Frame Analysis in Verloo(2007).12 That is measures that focus on preventing GRV from its roots (also called primary preven-tion), not those that ensure specific GRV offences will not be repeated, like the protectiveorders that most legislations have to protect individuals.13 For example, a disabled woman might have difficulty accessing support services indepen-dently, which might limit her access, compromise her privacy and if her carer is abusive,enable additional forms of abuse (Munson, 2011).14 Our project employed the term young people to explore precisely the issue of protectingfrom violence or sexual exploitation those who might be engaging in sexual relationships oftheir own.15 Italian legislation does not have specific offences against children or young people.Instead committing an offence against a minor is considered merely an ‘aggravating circum-stance’, in the sense that it intensifies how a crime is viewed and the severity with which itis punished.16 According to Katz (2015) domestic violence research tends to replicate the idea thatonly the adults have real agency, and that children’s is a result of mother’s agency (e.g. herleaning too much on them).ReferencesAdelantado J, Couceiro M, Iglesias M, Souto J. 2013.

    "abstract": "Do laws regarding violence against or sexual exploitation of young people recognise gendered and other power dynamics? Cross-national comparison of legal texts can illustrate the benefits of framing issues of violence/gender/youth in certain ways and offer critical reflection on particular legal frameworks or cultural understandings. This policy review is based on an analysis of select laws regarding gender-related violence (GRV) as relates to young people in Italy, Ireland, Spain and the UK. Here, GRV is defined as sexist, sexualising or norm-driven bullying, harassment, discrimination or violence whoever is targeted. It therefore includes gender, sexuality and sex-gender normativities, as well as violence against women and girls. A tension emerges between granting young people agency and recognising the multiple, intersecting power relations that might limit and shape that agency. This article draws out the implications for the UK in particular, highlighting the absence of preventative measures and the need for a broader approach to combat GRV",
