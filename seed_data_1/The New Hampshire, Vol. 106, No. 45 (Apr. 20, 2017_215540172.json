Part of UNH’s Pride Month, the LGBTQ+ and Ally pancake breakfast recognized 25 years of existence.The event opened as chap-lain and director of the Waysmeet Center, Larry Brickner-Wood, and associate vice president for community, equity and diversity, Jamie Nolan, offered attendees messages of the importance of gratitude and community in cur-rent times. Current interim dean of the UNH Graduate School, Cari Moorhead, followed, re-counting the history of the Pan-cake Breakfast.After two years of conﬂ ict with governor at the time, Mel-drim Thomson Jr., and the New Hampshire Supreme Court, the Gay Student Organization (GSO) was recognized as an ofﬁ cial stu-dent organization in 1973. UNH’s annual LGBTQ+ and Ally Pancake Breakfast became a tradition after the members of the GSO were denied a Pancake breakfast with Thomson they won in an auction and they decided to create their own event. Back then, Moorhead said individuals who identiﬁ ed as members of the LGBTQ+ com-munity felt pressured to attend the event in secret. Moorhead also stressed the importance of allies who have attended in the past and continue to help create a safe and inclusive environment for all stu-dents today. Trans UNH vice president, senior Charlie Durkin, introduced the event’s keynote speaker. Gary Bailey, professor of social work and the Urban Leadership Pro-gram at Simmons College, tack-led difﬁ cult topics regarding the intersectionality of race, sexual-ity, and gender expression.Bailey centered his speech around the concept and signiﬁ -cance of the Sankofa bird, which is able to look backward and for-ward at the same time. Using this analogy, Bailey reﬂ ected on past historical ﬁ gures who have been lost in history due to their inter-sectional identities. “In order for us to know where we’re going, we have to look back from whence we’ve come,” Bailey said. Bailey reﬂ ected on important ﬁ gures that have been erased from history such as writer James Bald-win, transgender people (then called “drag queens”) who were at the forefront of the Stonewall riots and Bayard Rustin, a major ﬁ gure from the civil rights move-ment.Bailey also discussed the importance of acknowledging in-tersectionality within oppressed Pancakescontinued on page 3Hococontinued on page 3Pancakes and PrideJordyn Haime/ STAFF(Above) Centerpieces at the event promoted solidarity.

By the end of the night, ap-proximately 3,200 individuals at-tended the specialty dinner, which is a notable uptick from the dining hall’s weeknight average of 2,500 people.In organizing the dinner, HoCo Executive Chef Christo-pher Kaschak said he sought to combine the multitude of this area’s local seafood with “an Ital-ian ﬂ are,” and while he said he’s been working on the project for a month and a half leading up to Wednesday night, he noted that the actual preparation of the dish-es began within the past week. In order to ensure freshness, accord-ing to Kaschak, most of the sea-food products were prepared on either the day before the dinner or the day of.Kaschak remarked that his staff had to hand scrub, boil and sterilize 3,600 scallop shells that they then proceeded to stuff with local clams, scallops, shrimp, oregano, parmesan cheese, garlic and a little bit of bread crumb.

On the weekends, the same hours will apply: 7 a.m. until 9 p.m.. The parking change will take effect in September.Right now, students can park in all visitors’ lots after 6 p.m. on the weekdays and for free on the weekends. The resolution passed at the meeting last Friday after members of the UNH administra-tion, members of the transporta-tion department, UNH students, and Durham town ofﬁ cials voted to change the rules.  The visitor lots affected are the following: Mill Road Lot (C Lot) and the Sage Way Visi-tor Lot. The initial proposal was to include H Lot, but instead the measure will only impact the visi-tor lots. “These are going to be rolled out in September,”  Student Body President Jonathan Dean said. “For September, they’re going to be lightly enforced as more of an educational enforcement. A lot of students won’t really know the rule right off the bat…they’ll be more reminded and not just tick-eted right away. They’re going to push for more education over the summer and educate students on the fact that all of the faculty and staff lots, the permit lots, at 6 o’clock they become open for free parking.”“I just think a lot of students don’t know about them because students… have their classes and they have their lots that they park in and they kind of stay in their areas and don’t realize that there are other areas that they can go to park,” Dean said. The Transportation Depart-ment and others attending took into consideration setting up signs for students who may not be aware of the other lots to park at, such as A and B Lot or the Alumni Center. The greatest concern was the issue of visitor and guest park-ing which had been brought to the attention of Dirk Timmons at the Transportation Department.“In my mind, when students have an issue on campus, we go to administration and we ask them to negotiate changes with us. I understand parking is a huge issue for students, but administra-tion really came to this committee meeting and came to the students and asked…this is an issue to us; our visitors are not having places to park. I think it’s respectful and appropriate for us to also come to the table and negotiate as well and ﬁ nd a solution that can work,” Dean said. “I think it’s just silly when there already is an issue with stu-dents having to pay tickets,” soph-omore psychology major Amerin McCall. “I really liked when I could go downtown around six ei-ther to the gym or the dining hall and park quickly to get in and out. Having people pay on weekends too is crazy to me. Most places have free parking on the week-ends, why can’t we? How will I have people come visit me next year when I am living at Madbury Commons? It’s just another thing I am going to have to stress about when my friends or family come to visit.”PARKINGcontinued from page 1garlic bread was also made avail-able to patrons—“the kids love the garlic bread,” Kaschak said.The LED-lit table, located on the bottom ﬂ oor of the new-est section of HoCo, was deemed the Community Table of the din-ner, and featured an assortment of fresh fruit, such as sliced lemon, strawberries, grapes and clem-entines, along with fresh cheese including provolone, gorgonzola, cheddar, mozzarella and fontina, and lastly, an arrangement of bread and rolls. Kaschak highlighted the meatballs being offered out of the stir-fry area as being “delicious,” and noted the station’s title as be-ing Now That’s a Meatball.Desserts at the dinner includ-ed tiramisu, mini connolis and an assortment of gelato ﬂ avors.

The goal behind Philan-thropy Day on Tuesday, April 18, was to make students aware of the opportunities that students have due to the generous dona-tions of alumni and donors around the area. This was shown through the various events around cam-pus on Tuesday afternoon held by University Advancement, such as writing thank you postcards to donors, Pay it Forward chocolate boxes, Tag Day and hosting an ice cream truck on the Great Lawn. Tag Day marked the various buildings on campus that are here because of donations to show stu-dents the impact donors’ contri-butions make. Buildings such as the Field House, Dimond Library, Paul College of Business and Economics and Kingsbury Hall.“The goal behind Tag Day is to make students aware of what spaces exist solely because of do-nor funds,” assistant director of student engagement for alumni relations, Megan Brunelle, said. The main slogan of the day throughout the various events was “Supporting the welfare of oth-ers.” According to Brunelle, stu-dent relations engagement for alumni relations wanted students to be aware of others in need, both monetary and kindness-wise, cre-ating the motive behind the choc-olate boxes. The box, which contained two Hershey’s Kisses, designated one for the receiver and one that was meant to be given to another person. Through this, students would grasp the idea of giving and how important it was to give rather than receive.“We just want to raise aware-ness of what philanthropy means, why it’s important and why stu-dents should pay attention to it,” Brunelle said. “We really want to build that over the four years with students so they understand what money is going to and why we’re raising money for the university.”Brunelle did not specify the turnout for Tuesday’s events, but the ice cream truck line had up to 50 people at some points. In order to receive ice cream, students had to answer a trivia question about philanthropy and its connection to UNH.

The event, referred to as Confidence Week, takes place from Monday, April 17 to Friday, April 21, outside of Dimond Li-brary from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. as a part of Kappa Delta’s Confidence Coalition. The event is targeted at all students and aims to promote confidence on campus.“Every day we try and pass out something as an incentive to the UNH community so that way it will make their day, make them happy, that type of thing,” Santa-niello said.  “For Kappa Delta we have a brand, and confidence is the whole platform of our soror-ity…” According to Santaniello, the event is also a way for the sorority to attract new members who normally wouldn’t think about joining Greek life. Kappa Delta member Brenna Goldberg recalled a student who rushed the sorority in part because of the positive messages they saw Kappa Delta promoting. “During recruitment in the fall, I talked to someone… about this event and they said that they started taking more interest in Kappa Delta and… in Greek life overall because we have such a positive message, and because it’s a different kind of philanthropy,” Goldberg said. Kappa Delta’s philanthro-pies, which include raising money for Prevent Child Abuse America and the New Hampshire Chil-dren’s Trust, also take place on a more local level outside of UNH’s campus. As part of their promotion of confidence, the so-rority works with local Girl Scout troops through confidence-build-ing activities.“Being a part of Kappa Del-ta, everyone builds each other up,” member Amanda D’Arezzo said. “People don’t usually stop and think about what makes them confident.” The goal of Confidence Week is to promote confidence for all students and being confi-dent means something different to each sorority member. For Jules Rinaldi, confidence is about feel-ing comfortable in your own skin.“Confidence is trying to look your best but also feel like your best self, so you feel comfortable in your own skin and that way when you feel comfortable, ev-eryone around you will feel your confidence. That’s what confi-dence is to me,” Rinaldi said.For Mary Hurley, it’s believ-ing in yourself. “Believe in yourself, and believe in everything you do and that you think you’ll make the right choices to be the best per-son,” Hurley said.

Carter, whose basketball coaching at Richmond High School in Richmond, California, inspired a Hollywood ﬁ lm, titled “Coach Carter,” offered students motivational advice for success. Samuel L. Jackson portrayed Carter in the 2005 Hollywood production after Carter’s coaching became noticed in 1999. Carter’s story was unique not only because of his game-winning coaching, but because of benching his entire team due to their grades. Carter’s talk was the last of the MUB’s Current Issues Lecture Series for the academic year. The lecture involved active participa-tion from the primarily student audience and was accepted with laughter throughout the hour-long event.Upon projecting a video in-cluding clips from the ﬁ lm and Carter’s past TV interviews, Carter surprised the audience by entering behind them, blowing his whistle and stopping the vid-eo. The energetic entrance from Carter gained the audiences’ at-tention and prepared them for his life-coaching session. “Enough of that, it’s time to get busy,” Carter announced as the video clip was stopped. Carter began his talk by ex-claiming the one thing he hates the most: “chronic complainers,” a term that he associates with any-one not willing to work harder when presented with difﬁ cult cir-cumstances.  Carter maintained the audi-ence’s attention throughout by calling on individuals to use as examples, and on two occasions asked two students to perform ﬁ ve and 20 pushups in front of the au-dience. According to Carter, one of his philosophies on life is that people must have stories. “Life is about stories,” Carter said. “You gotta have stories to tell.” “What is going to be your legacy?” Carter asked the audi-ence. Aside from requesting push-up demonstrations, Carter gave one student a $20 bill, used stu-dents as examples for an interac-tive discussion and signed auto-graphs. As for more lighthearted ad-vice, Carter told students: “You gotta laugh at yourself. Don’t worry about always being politi-cally correct. Just have fun.” “These are your good-old-days. It don’t get much better,” shared the former coach. Carter also offered words of encouragement for college stu-dents. He spoke on the importance of investing in a college education. “There’s a thin line between this thing called great and great-ness,” Carter said. Carter advised the audience members to always be “life-long learners.” He also stated, “You have to be a great follower to be a great leader.” In between motivating and inspiring advice, Carter shared his own experience as both a high school girl’s basketball coach and a boy’s basketball coach. The lecture ended with a brief Q&A session and the opportunity to take a picture with Carter. NH briefCONCORD, N.H. (AP) – Dartmouth College has reached a settlement with a family that said they suffered health prob-lems from drinking well water contaminated by runoff from a site where the Ivy League school once dumped animals used in science experiments.The school said Wednes-day it agreed to buy the home of Richard and Debbie Hig-gins and provide additional compensation to the family “to reﬂ ect their investment in necessary accommodations in their home.” It also is setting up a fund for the family’s fu-ture health and medical-related needs.“This will allow the Higginses to move on with their lives in a new location,” college spokeswoman Diana Lawrence said, adding that details of the settlement remain conﬁ dential.The college used Ren-nie Farm from the 1960s until 1978 to dump carcasses from “tracer experiments,” in which scientists used radioactive compounds to see how things moved through life systems. A nearby site also contained remains of human cadavers and stillborn fetuses used in medi-cal classes.One of the chemicals used in the experiments, a suspected carcinogen called 1,4-dioxane, leaked into the groundwater around the site - contaminat-ing the Higgins family well and raising fears that property values in the area had been af-fected. The chemical has been linked to eye, nose and throat irritation and, in long-term exposure, to liver and kidney damage, according to the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency.The Higgins family com-plained their contaminated well was responsible for a myriad of health problems, including rashes, hair and skin loss and dizziness. Even their dogs were not spared, they said, with one urinating blood and another vomiting.The family is satisﬁ ed with the settlement, their lawyer, Geoffrey Vitt, told Vermont Public Radio.“This is a settlement that takes care of everything,” he told VPR on Tuesday. “It takes care of any future health issues, it takes care of the emotional distress, it’s A to Z.”Dartmouth reaches Health settlementPleaseRecyclePleaseRecycle- Putting out twice a week since 1911 -You gotta laugh at yourself.

The meeting was held at the Durham Town Hall on Newmarket Road on Tuesday, April 18, at 8 a.m.. Seven of the nine-member council were in attendance but one of those seats is vacant. The meeting was lead by Economic Development Director Mary El-len Humphrey.Allan Howland is a council representative on the committee. He spoke brieﬂ y about a previ-ous meeting with local business owners that do and do not want to develop themselves further. “We have the Hopkins, who have Wildcat Pizza, they want to develop now,” Howland said. “We have Ken Young [Young’s Restaurant] who doesn’t want to develop for 10 years. We have Peter Murphy who just bought Town & Campus who does want to develop. So [we] were just getting a sense of where every-one was.”Howland encouraged lo-cal business owners to come to future meetings and share their thoughts.A new restaurant was pro-posed to be established this summer on the ground ﬂ oor of Madbury Commons. The restau-rant, Hop + grind, will specialize in burgers and beer. However, council member Sally Tobias, expressed some concern about this new business saying there is fear in town that too many de-velopments in town are directed toward student beneﬁ t. Tobias also said that she hears a lot of criticism about the downtown area. This revolved around the notion that there are too many students, which, ac-cording to Tobias, can act as a disincentive for others to go downtown.Warren Daniel is a regular member of the council and used to be a business owner in Dur-ham for 29 years. Daniel’s out-look on the impending restaurant was one of optimism.“I think restaurants are very important for the makeup of the downtown,” Daniel said. “We’re not going to have chains in downtown Durham, those days are gone. So, you know, what is the marketplace that we want?”Daniel stressed that veering away from student oriented busi-nesses would be damaging to the downtown and recognized the challenge of having such a small town compared to the large uni-versity.  In addition, Humphrey dis-cussed the future of the empty lot at 66 Main Street. Between People’s United Bank and Town & Campus, the lot used to be oc-cupied by the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house. After the meeting was ad-journed, Humphrey discussed with The New Hampshire how she does not think the lot at 66 Main Street will be given back to Alpha Tau Omega.“There’s been a number of attempts...at redeveloping that site. But for various reasons they haven’t come to fruition,” Hum-phrey said. According to Humphrey, the university owns the property and has submitted a request for proposal (RFP). Because of this, the university is now telling the town what they think would be best for the property rather than the other way around. “It might be only a hotel and restaurant, or it might be com-mercial space, we don’t know. We are going to let the people who are experts at making it work tell us instead of us saying we want this and that,” Hum-phrey said. “I think this time will be the successful one.”On the relationship between the town and the over 14,000 students that live and learn in Durham, Humphrey said, “We can’t disconnect the students because they are the lifeblood of Durham. The students, the university are really what makes Durham have a lot of the ame-nities that it has and desirability and the values of the properties here are directly related to the university. It’s a symbiotic rela-tionship.”jake dawson/staffCars parked in 66 Main Street, the lot whose future use was discussed at the Town Council meeting in Durham.We are going to let the people who are experts at making it work tell us instead of us saying we want this and that.‘‘Mary Ellen HumphreyDirector of Economic Development’’- Putting out twice a week since 1911 -THE NEW HAMPSHIRE NEWS THURSDAY, April 20, 2017 9La Festa Brick and Brew Pizzeria300 Central AvenueDover, NH 03820603-743-4100www.lafestabrickandbrew.comWe use only the freshest ingredients and make our unique sauces and doughs from scratch daily.

He will assume ofﬁ ce on July 31, 2017, follow-ing former Associate Dean Mary Rhiel’s decision to rejoin UNH’s German program. “I am certainly excited to serve and lead in the capacity of this ofﬁ ce,” Dr. Wilburn said. “I believe that I am following some great role models in Professor Mary Rhiel and Professor Ted Kirkpatrick. I am really excited to serve under Dean Heidi Bos-tic and support her leadership vision to work on behalf of, and advocate for students, faculty, and student support service per-sonnel to really allow the college of liberal arts to remain at the top of its game.” In 2009, Dr. Wilburn earned his Ph.D. from the University of Connecticut. Currently he is an associate professor of English and African-American Studies at UNH specializing in “African American literature and culture, Milton, and intertextuality stud-ies,” according to the Depart-ment of English’s webpage.Dr. Wilburn’s award-win-ning monograph, “Reaching the Gospel of Black Revolt: Ap-propriating Milton in Early Af-rican American Literature,” was published in 2014 by Duquesne University Press and it won the College Language Association’s award for Creative Scholar-ship and the John T.

You want to make innovation happen, you come to the college of liberal arts.”Along with being a pub-lished author, doctor and pro-fessor, Dr. Wilburn’s extensive resume also includes being a former U.S. Marine as well as alumnus of the Institute for the Recruitment of Teachers, where he currently serves as faculty and curriculum coordinator.According to Dr. Wilburn, he has serviced the UNH com-munity for many years, actively engaging in numerous boards, committees, and organizations around campus. Most recently, Dr. Wilburn took on a key lead-ership role in the search for a Women’s Studies Program, which saw three UNH ﬁ nalist-accepting job offers. “My position as associate dean really centers around learn-ing,” Dr. Wilburn said. “I want to learn, then synthesize what I learn towards helping to foster stronger communications across the three main contributors, stu-dents, faculty and support staff.”Dr. Wilburn received two UNH teaching awards while still managing to mentor students in the Ofﬁ ce of Multicultural Stu-dent Affairs. On top of that, he has sung the National Anthem at several Commencements, most notably before U.S. presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton in 2007.“As associate dean I aim to, ﬁ rst, listen. To listen and learn from colleagues, students, and faculty. I want to learn what in their minds are the triumphs and what are the challenges that we can turn into triumphs for the advancement of all, so that each student can get the premium ed-ucation they came for,” Dr. Wil-burn said.

(AP) — A New Hampshire school district has agreed to pay the family of a former stu-dent $150,000 to settle a law-suit alleging discrimination.The Manchester School District and school ofﬁ cials were sued last year, accused of denying the student his “consti-tutional and statutory rights” to equal access to public educa-tion.The eighth-grader was expelled in 2014 for allegedly assaulting another student. His family, which immigrated from South Sudan, ﬁ led a complaint with the federal Ofﬁ ce of Civil Rights saying hearings were conducted in English, without a translator.An agreement was reached in which the student returned to high school, but the suit says the district disclosed conﬁ den-tial information about him to the public and media, and took increased disciplinary action against him.A statement from the fam-ily and district Tuesday said although the parties have dif-ferent reasons for entering the settlement, they’re pleased the matter’s been resolved.NH School district faces lawsuitPORTSMOUTH, N.H.

My go-to outﬁ t in the sixth grade was knee-high socks, plaid bermuda shorts and a fedora, if that is any in-dication about what kind of 12-year-old I was.  It wasn’t really a secret that I was dif-ferent. I mean, anyone with eyes could seek my brace-face smile and lime green plaid shorts from a mile away.  Kids in my class would usually laugh at me and poke fun, but I always smiled and said, “I know, right?! Aren’t these shorts so cool?” and walk away.  Honestly, I don’t think I really noticed they were mak-ing fun of me at all. I was prob-ably too busy with my nose in a book to feel the daggers that came with their words.  But I also know that I truly didn’t care what others thought of me.  I liked those shorts, dang it, and I was going to wear them no matter what.My parents never told me how to dress (clearly), and always supported me in ev-erything I did, which is why I was so conﬁ dent in myself and my exceptionally authentic style.  Even though I deﬁ nite-ly grew out of my infamous clothes, I was lucky enough to never grow out of my con-ﬁ dence.On page ﬁ ve, Staff Writ-er Gates MacPherson wrote a piece about Kappa Delta’s Conﬁ dence Week, in which the sorority has been passing out presents to promote con-ﬁ dence outside of Dimond Library all week. I ﬁ nd it wonderful that these women are encouraging others to love themselves, as it is something that is very important in life. I encourage you all to partici-pate in this event and try and ﬁ nd conﬁ dence in yourself. But isn’t it sad that we need a conﬁ dence week at all? That we can’t ﬁ nd it on our own?  Unfortunately, in this day in age, conﬁ dence is very hard to come by for every-body.  Constant degradation in the media and the pressure to be the ‘right kind of per-son’ can take a real hit to your self- esteem.  Even I, the plaid-shorts-wearing, overly-egotis-tical executive editor, have had my fair share of doubtful days. It is so easy to compare yourself to the people around you and feel as though your looks, success, personality and other traits are just sim-ply not enough.  The problem with this lifestyle, however, is that we are all focusing on the people around us instead of fo-cusing on ourselves.  Conﬁ dence is not an outward force, it comes from within.  Searching in others around you for conﬁ dence will not get you anywhere, you have to ﬁ nd it in yourself.So many times I have been told that conﬁ dence is a person’s most attractive qual-ity.  There is a certain infec-tious nature to conﬁ dence that bleeds into the people surrounding you.  More often than not, having pride in who you are makes you walk taller, smile brighter and truly be a better you.  For something that is so necessary in this world, conﬁ dence is very seldom found, and I truly think that is sad.  People deserve to love who they are.  To ﬂ aunt what they’ve got and be proud of it, whatever it may be.  There is something to be proud of in every quality, even the ones you may not be too keen on.  So whether you hate your nose, your squeaky laugh or your terribly awkward apparel, try and love it anyways.  If it is a part of you naturally, then it is something to be proud of. Something to be proud ofConﬁ dence is not an outward force, it comes from within.  Searching in oth-ers around you for conﬁ dence will not get you anywhere, you have to ﬁ nd it in yourself.Colleen IrvineExecutive EditorTHE NEW HAMPSHIRE OPINION THURSDAY, April 20, 2017 13On Tuesday, I attended the 25th annual LGBTQ+ Pancake Breakfast, which I also wrote an article about in today’s is-sue. The speaker, Professor Gary Bailey of Simmons College, car-ried messages of  acknowledging the importance of intersectional issues in today’s world, as well as reflecting on how these is-sues have been lost to history. As anyone who as in attendance of either the breakfast or the Kid-der Lecture later that day knows, Bailey is an incredibly captivat-ing, articulate and simply inspir-ing speaker.Bailey quoted the great Au-dre Lorde several times during his speech at the pancake break-fast as well as during his lecture. The quote that resonated with me the most is actually made up of quotes from two different works that Bailey placed side by side for the purpose of his presentation: “I have come to believe over and over again that what is most important to me must be spoken, made verbal and shared, even at the risk of having it bruised or misunderstood…When we speak we are afraid our words will not be heard or wel-comed. But when we are silent, we are still afraid. So it is bet-ter to speak.” This also relates to Lorde’s most famous recitation, “your silence will not protect you.”Professor Bailey’s pre-sentations also briefly touched on generational differences. I thought about this after speak-ing with my father on the phone (sorry, Dad) after attending the events on Tuesday and express-ing anger and frustration toward the injustices faced by many in our own country and local com-munities. Since my father raised me on liberalism and Bob Dylan, I was surprised when he told me to try not to focus on the injus-tices in the world, or on things I can’t fix.Dr. Bailey also acknowl-edged the imperfections in our society. Though we have made significant progress that we should be proud of, the fight still continues and we are all still learning how to be good allies every day. He pointed out the the oppressed know best how to oppress because oppression has been modeled for them so well; “It’s so important for us as a community to hold ourselves up to a mirror and to really look deeply at ourselves…” he said on Tuesday.You may feel hopeless when faced with the countless injustic-es people within and beyond this country’s borders have to deal with every day. After all, how much can a college student in New Hampshire do?As I looked around the room at the pancake breakfast and the Kidder lecture, I was impressed by the number of people in attendance. However, I noticed that when I go to events like these on campus, I always see the same faces. I realized that many students here at UNH probably have the same attitude toward acting against injustice as my father did. We are so lucky to have the countless events that celebrate and educate about diversity at UNH, and everyone should take that opportunity to learn as much as they can about their commu-nity. Throughout the month of April alone, countless student organizations have been and will be continuing to host events for Pride Month, Sexual Assault Awareness Month and Genocide Awareness Month.Just because an issue does not personally affect you, or is tiring to think about, does not mean you shouldn’t say some-thing as Audre Lorde explained, as the ignorance of injustice is itself an injustice, and allows oppression to continue. Simply talking and having discussions may seem trivial, but it is an in-credibly important step to creat-ing change. I hope that we can continue to have conversations like those Gary Bailey brought to UNH this Tuesday so that we can all learn how to better our-selves as allies and as a commu-nity. Much has been done, but we still have a long way to go. For when these things directly affect our community, we cannot stay silent.Classified Organic farm help wanted, work for UNH cred-its or cash or both, work your own hours, green-house transplanting right now, but field work and farmers markets coming up, close to campus, bike to work. charliereid@ttlc.net or 679-8101 Email charliereid@ttlc.netLine Cooks, Counter Service, Hotesses Waitstaff, Doormen & BartendersHelp wanted part time TNHdigital.comThumbs up to reusable water bottles.Thumbs upThumbs downThumbs up to confidence.

THE NEW HAMPSHIRETHURSDAy, April 20, 201714 sportskids in school with disabili-ties.The quad rugby team is coached by Nate Loomis who has taken over for former coach Chandler Bullard. Loomis touched on what it is Northeast Passage does and what their goals are. “We do all sorts of therapy recreation and adaptive sports recreation, what that means is anyone with any sort of dis-ability we try and get them out and active and doing fun things, whether that’s sports or enjoying the outdoors,” Loomis said.Loomis also talked about how Northeast Passage offers both recreational and competi-tive sports. His rugby teams along with sled hockey and power soccer are the competitive teams provided.The competitive teams, such as the quad rugby team, compete against other teams all across the East Coast. “We definitely travel a lot, the rugby team season goes from September to April and we travel roughly once a month for tour-naments, including everywhere from Florida to Canada,” Loo-mis said.The Northeast Passage quad rugby team consists of players from around the Northeast along with players from UNH.  Fourth year player Robert Dudzisz was asked to come play for the team by Bullard and has loved playing quad rugby from the start.“I was living at Spalding and during a rec therapy day Northeast Passage came down and the coach at the time [Bul-lard] told me to come out and play. I came out a year later once I was recovered enough and fell in love with the sport,” Dudzisz said.The quad rugby team had an outstanding season this year. They made playoffs for the first time in team history, finishing third in regionals at UNH and moving on to sectionals in Wash-ington D.C., where their season ultimately ended. Despite the loss in section-als, Dudzisz is very excited for the future of the team after hav-ing one of their best seasons this past year “This year was a really great year for us, we’re really coming together. We’re looking to come back next year and hopefully we can advance further and move out West,” Dudzisz said.Look for the Northeast Pas-sage quad rugby team to con-tinue to improve and make tre-mendous strides as Northeast Passage continues to grow as an organization.

Shelby Strick-land and Rachel Morrison placed second and fourth in the high jump, respectively. Senior Aly-son Messina and sophomore Emileigh Glode went back-to-back in the 400m hurdles for first and second place, respectively. Other members of the small squad sent to Providence held their own as well, with a second-place finish from senior Cassie Kruse in the mile (5:00.06), Dani-elle Gajewski with a fourth-place finish in the 800m (2:09.86) and Alexandria Giese, Amanda Szy-manski and Margaret Champagne taking second, third and fourth, respectively, in the 5000m run.  “I felt good. Weather was really good. I definitely need to work on my steps this week and my start but I had a really good finish so I’m proud of that,” Glode said. Glode also expressed her team’s excitement for the upcom-ing conference championship. “I think being at home will really help and I think as a team we’ll do really well. We came in second in outdoor last year and third in indoor this year, which we weren’t that happy with, we felt we could do better, we came really close last year.” The men’s team sent a small-er squad of four to Providence, where Jacob Kittredge finished third in the 800m with a new personal record (PR) at 1:51.94. Sophomore Brett Hoerner placed eighth in the mile (4:10.58) alongside fellow sophomore Wil-liam Ulrich who set a new PR by crossing the line in 4:12.42, finishing 11th.  Senior Brandon Allen obtained fifth place in the 400m (49.57). Back at home the men fend-ed off Bates and Merrimack but fell to Maine by just one point in the Wildcat Invitational.  Individ-ual victories came from Andrew McFarland in the 400m hurdles (55.00), Ryan Chiesa in the steeplechase (9:33.30), Mitchell Carter in the triple jump with a new PR at 42-feet, 4.75-inches and Jon Chapman also with a PR throw in the hammer at 176-feet, 6 inches. Joel Nkounkou, a skilled multi-athlete, set a new PR in the 110m hurdles in a time of 14.96-seconds in route to the victory. Nkounkou contributed even more points when he fin-ished second in the long jump and third in the high jump. Thrower Nicholas Ritzo accomplished first in the shot put as well with a new PR of 52-feet, 4-inches. “It’s a decent time for me,” McFarland said of winning the 400m hurdles race. “I went 53.90 last year [and that] was my PR but [this was] my best time of the year so far so I guess I’m moving in the right direction.” “I think the kids are getting ready and this was our first week outside,” men’s head coach Jim Boulanger said on his team’s per-formance. “The weather’s been so bad, been so cold, snow on the track, so this was a fun week.” With the America East Championships just under three weeks away, the ‘Cats are seeing things sliding right into place. “I’m hoping, for everyone, it’s an incentive to protect your own house,” Boulanger said on UNH hosting the conference championships. “The conference is at such a level now [where] it’s really good. You have to be really good to score. So we’ll keep bat-tling away and get everyone to do their best that weekend.” Next meet up for the Wild-cats is the Larry Ellis Invitational in Princeton, New Jersey on April 20, and the UMass Lowell Invita-tional on Saturday, April 22.COURTESY OF RYAN PAGLIAROThe men’s team finished in second with 195 points on Saturday at the Wildcat Invitational.

The ‘Cats faced a two-game road trip and an 0-10 record un-til they battled the University of Vermont to win a tightly con-tested conference matchup. The ‘Cats mirrored that with a win against UMass Lowell to cap off the road trip with two tallies in the win column. But a lot can change in two weeks. After falling last week to UMBC at Wildcat Stadium, UNH dropped another this weekend on Saturday afternoon to the University at Albany, 9-8, to usher in a two-game los-ing streak following the pair of wins the ‘Cats put together in the games prior. By the end of the first pe-riod on Saturday, Albany found themselves in a battle with UNH. With only four different lead changes in the period, defense became even more vital to both teams’ game plan. Down 1-0, junior Krissy Schafer and freshman Michele Smith put UNH up 2-1 by 19:26 in the first half. Senior Devon Croke would score the only other UNH goal in the half. Al-bany’s Sarah Martin and Sam Tortora gave the Great Danes a 4-3 lead going into halftime, and the Wildcats had positioned themselves with a chance to win in the second half.Schafer and Croke started the second half scoring sequence off on the right track for UNH, each netting a goal to put the ‘Cats ahead 5-4 at 21:04.  The Great Danes responded with four consecutive goals in a span of roughly 10 minutes to go up 8-5 over the ‘Cats. Albany’s Emma Powlin scored a pair of goals in the process, netting her 20th and 21st goals on the sea-son. Martin netted her second of the game at 11:55 and Kenzie Neal completed the four-goal ef-fort before UNH could respond. With 6:52 to play in regula-tion, UNH did just that, and it appeared the ‘Cats were forming a comeback. Croke initiated the scoring for the ‘Cats by notching her third of the game, cutting the deficit to two at 8-6. At 4:50, se-nior Marissa Gurello put UNH within one, when she scored her 18th goal.With 53 seconds remaining in regulation, junior midfielder Carly Wooters scored the equal-izer to complete UNH’s come-back with a trio of consecutive goals to tie the game at 8-8.Unfortunately for the ‘Cats, Albany put to bed any hopes of overtime. With just 18 seconds left, Albany’s Dakotah Sav-itcheff scored her 31st goal of the season, and more important-ly, the game-winning goal for the Great Danes, as they defeated UNH, 9-8. Saturday’s loss marks UNH’s sixth by three or fewer goals on the season. In a game where both teams locked down on defense, the ‘Cats could not manage to force overtime for a chance to grab their third win of the season. UNH is now slated at 2-12 on the season with just two games remaining against Bing-hamton University and Boston University. Both matches will be played in Durham at Wildcat Stadium, with senior day tak-ing place on Saturday, April 22 against Binghamton.

UNH has a tradition of host-ing NCAA championship events that are highly successful with regards to participant and fan ex-perience. The 2019 men’s ice hockey regional will take place at SNHU Arena in Manchester (N.H.) on March 29-31. UNH was host of the 2017 NCAA Men’s Ice Hock-ey Northeast Regional at SNHU Arena this past March. The ‘19 re-gional will be the eighth hosted by the Wildcats – 2004, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. New Hampshire’s Whit-temore Center was the site of the 2005 NCAA Women’s Gymnas-tics Northeast Regional, and the regional will return to the Whitt on April 3, 2021. In addition to the aforemen-tioned men’s hockey and gymnas-tics regionals, UNH has been the host of three NCAA Women’s Ice Hockey Frozen Four events (2002, 2005, 2016) and five NCAA Ski-ing Championships, including 2017. The NCAA selected more than 600 host sites for prelimi-nary rounds and finals of prede-termined championships in Divi-sions I, II and III to be held from 2017-18 through 2021-22. Criteria for selecting the host sites included creating what will be an exceptional experience for the student-athletes, along with adherence to NCAA bid specifica-tions. Specifications can include, but are not limited to, providing optimal facilities; ease of travel to the location and ample lodg-ing; and adherence to NCAA prin-ciples, which include providing an atmosphere that is safe and re-spects the dignity of all attendees.Curtis earns MVP honors for third time in UNH careerThe University of New Hampshire women’s ice hockey team gathered Saturday at Three Chimneys Inn for its annual team banquet to reflect on the 2016-17 season, honor its student-athletes with six awards and recognize the Class of 2017.
