BUZUVIS* INTRODUCTION For fourteen years, Lindy Vivas was the head volleyball coach at California State University at Fresno (Fresno State).1  In that position, she transformed a program that had never had a winning season into one that regularly produced successful and highly competitive teams.2  In fact, under Vivas, Fresno State women’s volleyball teams had an overall win-loss record of 263-167 and received more invitations to post-season tournaments—including national and NCAA tournaments—than all teams in the history of the program, and the Western Athletic Conference named her coach of the year three times.3  Her success notwithstanding, Vivas was informed in December 2004 that her contract would not be renewed, ostensibly because she had failed to meet her performance objectives.4 Vivas was more than a successful and winning coach. She was an advocate for gender equity at a university with a long history of discrimination against women’s athletics in violation of Title IX.5  Along with other female coaches and administrators, several of whom also lost their jobs,6 Vivas had complained about discrimination to university officials and government regulators responsible for enforcing Title IX.7  Specifically, she alleged that Fresno State paid lower salaries and awarded shorter contracts to female coaches and allocated fewer resources, less support, and unequal access to facilities for the women’s volleyball team.8   * Associate Professor, Western New England College School of Law.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM 2 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 17:1 2010 Vivas filed suit against Fresno State, alleging that although the athletic director cited performance reasons for her termination, she was actually fired for her gender, her marital status, her perceived sexual orientation, and her whistleblowing on gender discrimination within the department.9  In July 2007, jurors in the Fresno County Superior Court agreed, except as to the marital status claim, and awarded her $5.85 million in damages10—at the time, the largest jury award in a Title IX case.  Later that year, Fresno State announced a multi-million dollar settlement with Diane Milutinovich, an athletic department official who also claimed she was fired in retaliation for her efforts to ensure the department’s compliance with Title IX.11  Fresno State then lost another high-profile trial involving similar claims of retaliation.12  This time, the damages award to the plaintiff, former women’s basketball coach Stacy Johnson-Klein, was a staggering $19.1 million.13 Due to the record-setting jury awards and multiple separate plaintiffs, the Fresno State cases are the most visible examples of Title IX retaliation cases in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education,14 which recognized a private right of action for retaliatory discrimination under Title IX.  In the short time since the decision was released, it has already been invoked in a number of retaliation cases involving college athletics.15  Coaches, administrators, and other university officials from California to Florida—both male and female, but mostly female—have filed suit against their institutions, complaining that their contracts were terminated or not renewed, or that they were harassed or otherwise mistreated, because they raised concerns about gender equity on behalf of students, other coaches, or themselves.  These cases, some of which have also resulted in significant verdicts and settlements, provide insight into athletic department culture and reveal obstacles women face in reaching positions of leadership in college   9.

These cultural considerations are particularly relevant in light of the enormous gender gap among college head coaches and athletic administrators.  Women fill less than a quarter of head coach and athletic director positions in college athletics, and are even minorities among coaches of women’s teams.16 Discrimination against women seeking or serving in leadership positions in sport is worthy of analysis, not only for the sake of individual women who desire to self-actualize as a head coach or athletic administrator, but because the unique role of sport in society gives underrepresentation of women in leadership positions additional significance.  Due to its high visibility and widespread appeal17—its veritable iconic status—sport is a salient site of cultural production.18  That is, sport operates on a symbolic level, reflecting and transmitting shared cultural values.  Among these values, sport helps define the attributes associated with leadership,19 and thus, derivatively, power.20  By remaining, in the words of Carole Oglesby, “uniquely impervious to the inclusion of women,”21 sport operates to ensure women’s exclusion from powerful social roles more generally, as both men and women exposed to the male-dominated realm of sport “internalize . . . the dominant vision” of power as a masculine trait.22  Put another way, when women serve in head coaching   16.

Moreover, the fact that plaintiffs in Title IX retaliation cases against college athletic departments are enjoying new levels of success provides an opportunity to speculate optimistically about the power of law to effect positive change in the culture of college athletics.  Following the Supreme Court’s recent validation of a private right of action to challenge retaliation in Jackson, coaches and athletic administrators have never before had more legal remedies with which to tackle sex discrimination in college athletics.  Together with the recent high-profile multi-million dollar jury verdicts and settlements, these legal remedies create a strong incentive for athletic departments seeking to avoid liability to monitor for and address institutional practices that drive and deter women from coaching. With this in mind, this Article proceeds as follows.  Part I describes Title IX’s role as an employment discrimination statute and examines the contribution of Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education as a catalyst for coaches’ retaliation claims.  Part II describes in greater detail the wave of Title IX retaliation cases that has followed the Jackson decision, including those against Fresno State.  Part III examines the content of those cases in connection with existing empirical and theoretical scholarship about women in college coaching and athletic administration.  Part IV examines the legal significance of the retaliation cases as a trend, and concludes with cautious optimism about the potential for law to help expose, remedy, and deter discriminatory practices within the leadership of college sport. PART I TITLE IX, EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION, AND RETALIATION Though Title IX is perhaps best known for its role in mitigating sex discrimination against female students and athletes, the statute also protects education sector employees against discrimination on the basis of sex.24  The Supreme Court has confirmed that the statute contains an implied private right of action,25 which plaintiffs may use to seek monetary damages.26  Moreover, Title IX plaintiffs are not subject to the cap on compensatory damages, statute of limitations, or exhaustion requirements that apply to employment discrimination cases filed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,27 which also governs educational institutions as employers.  Some jurisdictions hold that Title VII is the exclusive route for relief for employment discrimination claims in   23. Kurt A.

Prior to the Court’s 2005 decision in Jackson, it was unclear whether and to what extent private enforcement of Title IX extended to retaliation claims.  Over the years, federal courts including both the Fourth and Fifth Circuit Courts of Appeals29 had allowed plaintiffs to bring retaliation claims against a college or university employer, but their decisions were called into question by a 2001 Supreme Court decision, Alexander v. Sandoval.30  At issue in Sandoval was whether a private right of action existed for violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,31 the statute that prohibits race discrimination by programs receiving federal funds.32  The Court held that the plaintiff’s challenge was beyond the scope of the statute’s private right of action because the prohibition against discrimination with a disparate racial impact is contained only in Title VI’s implementing regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice, rather than within the statute itself.33  Private enforcement of Title VI is therefore limited to intentional discrimination prohibited by the statute and does not extend to other manners of discrimination prohibited only by regulation.  Like the disparate impact discrimination at issue in Sandoval, retaliation against employees of educational institutions who complain of discrimination is prohibited under Title IX’s regulations,34 but is not specifically mentioned in the statute itself.  Since Title IX was modeled on Title VI and is regularly subject to judicial interpretations of Title VI, some courts therefore interpreted Sandoval to foreclose private enforcement of retaliation claims under Title IX.35   28.

After he complained to school district officials about inequitable allocation of athletic facilities and other resources between girls’ and boys’ basketball teams, he received negative performance evaluations and ultimately lost his coaching position.37  He sued the school board, arguing that because he was dismissed for blowing the whistle on sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX, Title IX protected him personally.  The school board successfully argued before the district court and the Eleventh Circuit that private enforcement of Title IX did not extend to retaliation claims.38  The court reasoned that the contrast between Title IX, which does not contain an anti-retaliation provision, and Title VII, which does expressly prohibit retaliation against employees who challenge unlawful employment discrimination,39 suggests that Congress did not intend for Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination to encompass retaliation.  Applying Sandoval, the court concluded that since retaliation is not prohibited by Title IX itself but only by its implementing regulations, private plaintiffs could not rely on Title IX to provide a remedy against retaliation.40 Jackson’s appeal from this decision gave the Supreme Court an opportunity to clarify the meaning and scope of Sandoval.  In its 2005 decision,41 the Court agreed that Title IX’s private right of action extends only to conduct prohibited within the statute itself, rather than in a regulatory interpretation.42  However, as Justice O’Connor’s majority opinion reasoned, retaliation against whistleblowers is included in Title IX’s broad, statutory prohibition on sex discrimination.43  O’Connor rejected the appellate court’s conclusion, drawn from its comparison of Title IX to Title VII, that Congress intends to include retaliation in anti- enforcement of retaliation under Title VI, but that the right does not protect third parties who complain of violations).  36.

The retaliation alleged by Coach Jackson was outside the scope of Title VII’s anti-retaliation provision because his coaching duties were revoked not for complaining about discrimination in the terms and conditions of his employment, but for complaining about discriminatory treatment of his students.  40.

See id. at 173-74: Retaliation against a person because that person has complained of sex discrimination is another form of intentional sex discrimination encompassed by Title IX’s private cause of action.  Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act.  It is a form of “discrimination” because the complainant is being subjected to differential treatment.  Moreover, retaliation is discrimination “on the basis of sex” because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.  We conclude that when a funding recipient retaliates against a person because he complains of sex discrimination, this constitutes intentional “discrimination” “on the basis of sex,” in violation of Title IX (internal citations omitted). Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 7 discrimination statutes only when it does so expressly.44  She pointed out that Title IX prohibits all discrimination in its scope that has not been expressly exempted, whereas Title VII prohibits only that which has been enumerated.  Therefore, the fact that retaliation is not expressly mentioned in Title IX does not put retaliation beyond the statute’s scope.45 Thus, after Jackson, it is clear that plaintiffs may rely on Title IX’s private right of action to challenge both direct discrimination prohibited under Title IX and punitive action directed at those, such as coaches, who complain about or seek remedy for perceived discrimination.  So clarified, Title IX’s private right of action is a significant weapon against sex discrimination generally and in the context of college athletics specifically.  Whereas Title VII makes private enforcement available to plaintiffs who faced retaliation for challenging discriminatory employment conditions, plaintiffs may use Title IX to seek remedy for retaliation motivated by their complaints about any ostensible Title IX violations.  Such violations may include an athletic department’s failure to provide an equitable number of athletic opportunities to female students, adequate resources and support to women’s programs, or equal treatment of coaches.  Moreover, a retaliation plaintiff need not prove that the predicate discrimination occurred, only that the plaintiff reasonably believed the violation to exist.46  A whistleblower coach will be more likely to challenge the reprisal against her even if she would not (or could not) have directly challenged the discrimination she perceived due to legal or evidentiary weaknesses inherent in such claims.  For example, it is difficult for female coaches to challenge sex-based pay discrimination because they must demonstrate the university’s failure to treat them similarly to a male coach of comparable responsibility.47  Due to Title IX’s cause of action for retaliation, it is more likely that a coach who is fired for complaining about perceived pay discrimination will pursue some relief against the university than if she was limited to remedies for pay discrimination itself or if her retaliation claim required her to succeed on the pay discrimination claim itself.48 In addition, the Jackson Court’s interpretation of Title IX’s private right of action significantly expands statutory protection against employment discrimination in the education sector.  While college and university employees may challenge employment discrimination under Title VII as well as (or as an alternative to) Title IX,49 Title VII’s anti-retaliation provision is limited to   44.

Moreover, as noted earlier, relying on Title IX instead of Title VII avoids the damages cap and extends a remedy for retaliation to those plaintiffs who may have failed to preserve their Title VII claims by filing first with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) within 180 days.51  In addition, while some states have whistleblower protection statutes that may also protect college and university employees who complain about perceived sex discrimination,52 many are restricted in scope to public employees.53  Title IX’s cause of action for retaliation, on the other hand, applies regardless of state law, and protects employees of any public or private school that receives federal funds.  Lastly, while the First Amendment may also protect education sector employees against reprisal for engaging in protected speech, this remedy only applies to public institutions.54  It is further limited by a recent Supreme Court decision55 confining this application of the First Amendment to protected speech by employees in their personal rather than professional capacities—a restriction likely to apply to coaches who complain about discrimination in college or university athletic departments.56 By expanding the remedies for retaliation in the ways described above, and by raising the profile of retaliation in general, the Supreme Court’s decision in Jackson laid the groundwork for suits against colleges and universities by numerous coaches and others in athletics administration who raised concerns about gender equity in athletics and experienced adverse employment consequences.  To be sure, many of these cases also involve claims of direct discrimination, sexual harassment, or retaliation predicated on employment discrimination complaints, all of which were actionable prior to Jackson.  Title IX retaliation claims in the mold of Jackson are in the foreground of these cases, suggesting they are providing the momentum for this trend.  Intersecting and  (explaining and citing examples that some courts hold Title VII precludes a Title IX right of action for employment discrimination, others have held that Title IX’s right of action only applies in such context as retaliation where Title VII’s remedy is limited, still others hold that a Title IX cause of action for employment discrimination may be alleged, but differ as to whether Title IX, Title VII, or Title VI standards apply).  50. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).  The Supreme Court recently held that the retaliatory action prohibited by this provision is not limited to “workplace-related or employment-related” actions, but includes any adverse action that could dissuade the employee from protesting discriminatory workplace conditions.  Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 548 U.S. 53, 67 (2006).  Under this expansive reading, a coach who was not only fired, but harassed, investigated, and subjected to closer scrutiny in retaliation for protected activity like complaining of salary discrimination against female coaches would have a cause of action under Title VII as well as Title IX.  51. 42 U.S.C §§ 2000e-5(e)(1), 1981a(b).  52.

Thus, a right of action for retaliation is valuable not only as a weapon of enforcement against reprisals for sex discrimination, but for increasing the likelihood of litigation challenging the predicate discrimination itself.  Consequently, there is increased visibility and public awareness of the multiple, interrelated components of discrimination operating against women in college athletic departments, which are often difficult to address in a stand-alone claim.  Over its next two Parts, this Article will present this trend of cases in greater detail and then examine those cases thematically.  PART II RETALIATION CASES: HISTORY AND THE RECENT TREND Gender-based retaliation cases in the context of college athletics are not a new phenomenon and certainly predate the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision in Jackson.  In 1997, for example, former Oregon State University softball coach Vickie Dugan won a $1.3 million jury verdict57 in a lawsuit that claimed OSU violated her First Amendment rights when it fired her in retaliation for defending the softball team’s varsity status and for cooperating with Department of Education Office for Civil Rights’ (“OCR”) investigation of the university’s Title IX compliance.58  OSU argued that Dugan was fired because her team produced a 0-24 record for the 1994 season.59  However, Dugan convinced the jury that her team’s losing season was a product of the very inadequate and inequitable funding that she was fired for challenging.60 Jan Lowrey was another early retaliation plaintiff.  In 1995, she charged that she was demoted from her position of Women’s Athletic Coordinator at Tarleton State (part of the Texas A&M system) after she complained about gender discrimination within the athletic department, including inequitable distribution of resources between men’s and women’s teams, as well as lower pay for female athletic department employees.61  The district court dismissed   57. The parties later agreed to settle OSU’s appeal for over $1 million, a figure that included attorney’s fees and costs.  Sharon Ginn, Gender Lawsuit’s End Gives “Relief,” ST.

A similar claim filed today would likely fail as a result of the Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Garcetti v.

Handler had sued in 2002, alleging that she was given poor performance evaluations and was subsequently terminated in retaliation for filing complaints with OCRabout unequal pay and treatment of the women’s softball team.63 While retaliation cases in college athletics—even successful ones like those noted above—were not unknown prior to Jackson, the cases filed since the Court’s 2005 ruling are significant because they are recent and because there are enough of them to examine for trends.  Thus, this part will describe those retaliation cases, both resolved and pending, that were filed or litigated in substantial part in the wake of Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education. A. Fresno State As mentioned in the Introduction to this Article, the most notorious institutional defendant in this contemporary trend of retaliation cases is Fresno State University.  Fresno State has a long history of Title IX complaints.  For much of the 1990s, the athletic department was subject to regulatory scrutiny after an investigation by the OCR that revealed widespread Title IX violations including significant disparities in opportunities for female student-athletes64 and inequities in the treatment of existing men’s and women’s teams.65  Under pressure to comply with Title IX or else lose its federal funding, Fresno State committed itself to a Corrective Action Plan to increase support and status for women’s sports.66  In 2001, however, Fresno State’s Associate Athletic Director,   62.

Thus, Lowrey was allowed to proceed with her claims that she was demoted for protesting inequitable allocation of resources between men’s and women’s sports as violations of Title IX.  However, the Supreme Court, in Alexander v. Sandoval, discussed supra, cast doubt on the private right of action for retaliation under Title IX that had been recognized by the Fifth Circuit.  63. Jamie Malernee, Coach Sues NSU, Claims Gender Bias; University Denies Charges, Alleges She Was Unreliable and Belligerent, SUN-SENTINEL, Oct. 20, 2002, at 1B.  In press about the lawsuit, Handler described the athletic director who terminated her, Corey Johnson, as “demeaning and homophobic” and described how he insisted on having more “feminine role models in the office” and required that she wear a dress to an office banquet for fear of what people would “assume” if she “showed up in a pantsuit.”  Id.  64. See, e.g., Vivas Complaint, supra note 1, at 3.  OCR found that Fresno State did not comply with any of the three alternative tests for measuring equity in the number of athletic opportunities available to each sex.  Women comprised 54.3% of the student body but received only 27.3% of the athletic opportunities.  The university did not have a history and continuous practice of expanding athletic opportunities for women, and it had made no effort to determine whether it was otherwise satisfying the interests and abilities of the female student population.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 11 Diane Milutinovich, a 22-year department veteran who had worked on Fresno State’s compliance plan, complained internally about the athletic department’s backsliding on its obligations under the plan.  In a complaint to OCR, she cited the department’s failure to raise the proportion of female student-athletes as agreed and its reluctance to devote resources to women’s athletics.  She pointed out disparities in the compensation paid to employees of men’s and women’s athletics respectively, and complained that women’s sports had been demoted from or denied “tier one” (most favored) status in violation of Fresno State’s obligations under the Corrective Action Plan.  Soon thereafter, newly-appointed Athletic Director Scott Johnson announced a department reorganization that eliminated Milutinovich’s position.  This reorganization resulted in her transfer to a different university department.67  Milutinovich sued, arguing that Johnson transferred her in retaliation for filing the complaint with OCR.68  She later filed a new lawsuit to challenge her reassignment from her new position as retaliation for her continued efforts in support of gender equity.69 Before volleyball coach Lindy Vivas’s termination in 2004, she too had filed a complaint with OCR in which she challenged the athletic department’s reluctance to promote volleyball to a tier one sport.70  She also filed an internal grievance with the university’s human resources department, challenging the disparity in the length of employment contracts for male and female coaches and, like Milutinovich, Vivas alleged that her termination was retaliation for challenging the department’s gender inequities.71  A few months later, the women’s basketball coach, Stacy Johnson-Klein, was placed on administrative leave for mistreating players and ultimately terminated after an investigation revealed that she had “inappropriately obtained” pain medications from students and staff.72  Although Johnson-Klein admitted to obtaining Vicodin from a player, she too filed suit and claimed that the investigation itself was a retaliatory response to her internal complaints about sexual harassment and gender disparities73 affecting the women’s basketball team and her threat to file a complaint with OCR.74   67.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM 12 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 17:1 2010 In October 2007, Fresno State settled with Milutinovich for $3.5 million.75  Both Vivas’s and Johnson-Klein’s lawsuits proceeded to trial, where they produced not only multi-million dollar verdicts in the plaintiffs’ favor, but volumes of testimony about the hostile environment and discriminatory treatment of female coaches and staff.  Jurors in Vivas’s three-week trial in the summer of 2007 found truth in Vivas’s allegations that she was terminated for advocating gender equity, including efforts to hold the department to its promises under the Corrective Action Plan, particularly, to elevate women’s athletic programs to tier one status and to move women’s volleyball competitions from the gymnasium to the university’s premier venue, and for advocating multi-year contracts for successful, long-serving female coaches like herself and softball coach Margie Wright.76  The jury also agreed that her termination was not only retaliatory but was direct discrimination on the basis of her sex and perceived lesbian sexual orientation.77  Stacy Johnson-Klein testified on Vivas’s behalf about Johnson’s plans to “get rid of lesbians in the athletic department,” and his preference for hiring “female coaches who were straight and attractive.”78  She also described how Johnson and others referred to Vivas, Milutinovich, and softball coach Margie Wright, as “the other team” in contrast to “the home team” employees who did not make trouble, and how Johnson had instructed other athletic department officials to “make Vivas’[s] life miserable.”79  Wright testified about a 2000 incident in which male athletic department staff made posters depicting stick figures of female athletes’ bodies with male administrators’ heads and proclaimed “Ugly women’s athletes day.”80  Wright also corroborated Johnson-Klein’s descriptions of the department’s homophobic culture by describing the homophobic comments members of the school’s baseball team directed to her players.81 Fresno State’s defense—that Vivas was fired for performance reasons, including her alleged unwillingness to schedule competitions against top opponents—was exposed as pretext.  The jury returned a $5.85 million verdict in Vivas’s favor, which was later reduced to $4.52 million due to a weak evidentiary basis for the jury’s calculation of Vivas’s future nonmonetary   75.

But even in its reduced form, Lindy Vivas’s verdict was the largest awarded in a Title IX case.82 Despite addressing a similar pattern of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, Johnson-Klein’s trial was quite different from Vivas’s.  The lynchpin to Fresno State’s defense of Johnson-Klein’s wrongful discharge claim was the undisputed fact that she had used painkillers during her tenure as head women’s basketball coach and that she had taken Vicodin pills from one of her players.83  This drug usage provided a legal and persuasive justification for the decision to terminate Johnson-Klein’s employment.84  However, over the course of the two-month trial, Johnson-Klein’s attorneys successfully neutralized Fresno State’s termination defense with two key arguments.  First, they presented evidence suggesting that Athletic Director Scott Johnson called for an investigation of Johnson-Klein in order to find a reason to fire her.  Both the timing of the investigation, which commenced soon after Johnson-Klein threatened to file a complaint with OCR over inequitable treatment of the women’s basketball team,85 and the fact that Johnson-Klein’s behavior had not been the subject of any serious complaints until the investigation supported this theory.  Although the investigation produced a detailed account of Johnson-Klein’s drug and behavior problems, in light of the apparently retaliatory nature of the decision to investigate, these reasons did not appear to be the university’s primary motive in firing her. The second way in which Johnson-Klein neutralized the university’s argument that she was fired for drug abuse was by turning that argument into evidence of a sexist double standard.  According to witness testimony, around the same time that Johnson-Klein was struggling with painkillers, the head men’s basketball coach Ray Lopes was helping his players cover up positive drug tests so that they could continue to play.86  Upon discovering this, Fresno   82. Robison, supra note 10, at A1.  Cf. Anteola & Lygh, supra note 77.  Fresno State appealed, but later settled for $5.2 million, including attorney’s fees. Prior to Vivas’s case, the largest jury verdict in a Title IX case was the $2 million award to Heather Sue Mercer in 2000, a verdict that was later vacated on appeal.  See Mercer v. Duke Univ., No. 01-1512, 2002 WL 31528244 at *644 (4th Cir. Nov. 15, 2002) (unpublished decision) (holding that Title IX does not support private right of action for punitive damages).  Mercer had sued Duke University for discriminatory treatment she received as a kicker on the football team. In cases involving coaches, the largest Title IX jury verdicts prior to Vivas’s were Sanya Tyler’s $2.4 million verdict (later reduced to $1.1 million) against Howard University in 1994, in a case that alleged sex discrimination and salary inequity, and Vicki Dugan’s $1.28 million award against Oregon State University in 1997.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM 14 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 17:1 2010 State quietly paid Lopes $200,000 in settlement of his employment contract,87 even though he had also racked up hundreds of NCAA violations and, according to witnesses, stonewalled a police investigation of one of his players for murder.88  This cast doubt on the university’s claim to have zero tolerance for drugs, and suggested that it was not the reason for Johnson-Klein’s termination. Aside from the drug issue, Johnson-Klein’s trial also differed from Vivas’s in the way sexuality factored into the case.  While Vivas alleged and successfully demonstrated to the jury that she was targeted in part because she was perceived as a lesbian (and because she associated with Milutinovich and Wright, who were similarly stigmatized), Johnson-Klein’s theory was that she was hired and received favorable treatment initially because of her heterosexy appearance and behavior.  Johnson-Klein’s sexuality, therefore, was not stigmatized so much as exploited.  During Vivas’s trial, Johnson-Klein testified that she was hired “as a straight female to clean up the program” and to “sell” a “family atmosphere.”89  In her own case, she described how Athletic Director Johnson publically referred to her as “my Miss America,” and once suggested that she “go one-on-one” with a university supporter.90  Yet, when Johnson-Klein emphasized her femininity and heterosexuality, athletic department officials criticized her appearance91 and subjected her to sexual harassment in the form of groping, solicitations, and other inappropriate remarks.92 Johnson-Klein’s jury agreed that she had suffered harassment and retaliation and awarded her $19.1 million in damages.  Skeptical of the basis for the noneconomic damages included in this award, the trial judge reduced the award to $6.6 million plus attorney’s fees and costs.93  In June 2008, Fresno State agreed to drop its appeal in exchange for a $9 million total payout over 20 years.94 B.

Soon after the meeting, Baker wrote a letter to the university’s interim president, Richard Pegnetter, summarizing the coaches’ concerns.95  Baker’s letter characterized the athletic department’s workplace culture as one of “intimidation,” “isolation,” “intolerance,” and “insensitivity.”96  Baker criticized the athletic director for failing to hire female coaches, failing to support female coaches, using closed searches to make hiring decisions in the department, paying female coaches lower salaries under shorter employment contracts, and directing hostility toward a coach because of her sexual orientation.97  The letter also detailed disparities in the resources allocated to the men’s and women’s programs.98 In their eventual lawsuit, the coaches alleged that soon after Baker’s letter was delivered, they were presumed to be the source of the information it contained and were targeted for retaliation as a result.99  Specifically, soon after the letter was delivered, both head coaches received negative performance evaluations for the first time ever and Flood was placed on administrative leave for what FGCU publically described as “issues involving student welfare.”100  The basis for this action was revealed to be a claim that Flood had inappropriately tugged at a player’s shirt during practice.101 FGCU’s response to the substance of Baker’s letter was also controversial.  In January 2008, an outside law firm hired by FGCU to conduct an external review of the athletic department’s Title IX compliance concluded that the specific grievances Baker alleged did not constitute actual Title IX violations.102  However, the report does not address a major theme in Baker’s letter: the hostile, intimidating atmosphere for female coaches.103  The external investigation did, however, discredit the negative performance evaluations that   95.

It revealed that FGCU was concerned about more than just the shirt tugging incident: there were also charges that Flood had inappropriate sexual contact with a female person not associated with the University while on a volleyball road trip106 and that she had been in an inappropriate, “amorous” relationship with a female student intern.107  The report concluded that this latter charge was substantiated by evidentiary support, and this conclusion provided the basis for FGCU’s decision to terminate Flood four days later.108 While Flood publically denied that she had had an affair with a student, her lawsuit challenging her termination focused on the reason for FGCU’s investigation in the first place.109  Flood maintained that the investigations into her personal life were, like the negative performance evaluations, part of the athletic department’s efforts to “manufacture grounds for her removal”110 because she had participated in efforts to expose gender disparities which she reasonably believed to constitute sex discrimination in violation of Title IX.

C. Other Settled and Decided Cases 1. U.C. Berkeley In July 2007, the Regents of the University of California agreed to pay more than $3.5 million to Karen Moe Humphreys to settle a wrongful termination lawsuit she had filed against the University of California, Berkeley and its athletic director, Steve Gladstone.120  Humphreys, an Olympic gold medalist and former head coach of Berkeley’s women’s swim team, had served as the assistant athletic director for student services from 1993 until the position was eliminated in 2004.121  Humphreys alleged that before she was terminated, she was passed over to fill a newly-created position as assistant athletic director for compliance, in favor of a man who did not have Humphreys’s experience or seniority.122  Humphreys argued that her position was targeted for elimination and that she was overlooked for the new position because she had complained to university investigators about the athletic director’s unfair treatment of female employees—including failure to consider or promote women to senior positions—and a hostile work environment for women in the athletic department.123  She also claimed that the retaliation she experienced was due in part to her complaints to university officials about the department’s violation of certain NCAA rules regarding financial aid.124  Humphreys further alleged that male supervisors told her that she was “intimidating” and “too strong for a woman.”125  According to Humphreys, after the layoff was announced, another   119.

Id. at 7.  It is fitting that the phrase “too strong for a woman” would appear in a complaint seeking enforcement of Title IX, as that phrase has been cited as the catalyst for Title IX itself.  In 1969, a colleague of Bernice Sandler offered it as an explanation for why she would not get the teaching position for which she had applied.  Inspired by that incident, Sandler became an activist and coordinated a national campaign to eradicate sex discrimination in education, a campaign that led to the introduction and enactment of Title IX.

San Diego State University In September 2008, San Diego State University announced it would pay $1.45 million to former swimming and diving head coach Deena Deardurff Schmidt in settlement of her Title IX retaliation case against the university.127  Schmidt’s lawsuit alleged that the university’s failure to renew her contract as head coach of the women’s swimming and diving program—ostensibly for failing to produce a winning team—was the result of unrealistic expectations, as her team had lacked a permanent facility since the university demolished the pool in 1999.128  She alleged that her termination was actually in retaliation for complaining to the athletic director about the lack of a pool, gender inequities in head coaches’ salaries, and the athletic director’s failure to award her a multi-year employment contract.  Schmidt’s complaint also detailed how her efforts to raise funds for the new pool construction resulted in an incident of sexual harassment by a prospective donor.129  After terminating Schmidt, SDSU hired a male coach to head the swimming and diving team, reducing the number of female head coaches at SDSU to four of out of sixteen teams (of which ten are women’s sports).130 3. Iowa State University In November 2008, an Iowa state trial court jury awarded $287,000 to former Iowa State University softball coach Ruth Crowe.131  In her Title IX retaliation suit against the university, Crowe had alleged that after nine years in the head coach position, the university dismissed her before her contract expired because she had complained about salary discrimination and the university’s   126.

Schmidt’s efforts to raise funds for a new pool led to an incident of sexual harassment.  A potential donor who had made contributions to athletics in the past “repeatedly physically grabbed her and promised to donate money to construct a new pool if she would have sex with him.”  Schmidt alleges that the athletic director told her that she “needed to deal with it” and did nothing to stop the donor’s conduct.

Rather, she was fired because of an overall losing record and complaints by athletes and parents.133  However, in finding ISU liable, the jury signaled its conclusion that this explanation was pretext for a retaliatory motive. 4. San Diego Mesa College In July 2008, Lorri Sulpizio and Cathy Bass sued San Diego Mesa College for direct discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title IX.134  Sulpizio, formerly the head women’s basketball coach, and Bass, the director of basketball operations, were fired after seven years of service, they alleged, because they challenged discriminatory treatment of their team.  This discrimination included the dedication of their team’s locker room to visiting football teams during a November invitational, disruptions to their practices by the men’s football team, and other inequities.135  Sulpizio and Bass also maintained that the Athletic Director’s decision to fire them reflected discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  They were terminated soon after an Athletic Director who had allegedly investigated and inquired about Sulpizio’s sexual orientation and expressed concern about the lesbian “image” of the team identified the two as domestic partners in a local news story.136  In December 2009, a jury awarded Lorri Sulpizio $28,000 in damages after finding that her termination had been retaliatory.  The jury did not find sufficient evidence to support her claim of sexual orientation discrimination, however.137 5. University of Nevada, Reno The one post-Jackson retaliation case to generate an unfavorable decision for a female plaintiff was Terri Patraw’s lawsuit against University of Nevada, Reno.  In May 2009, a state trial court dismissed Patraw’s claim that she had been fired from her position of head women’s soccer coach in August 2007,138 in retaliation for blowing the whistle on NCAA violations committed by the men’s golf coach139 and for complaining on numerous occasions to the athletic director   132.

Patraw had reported Rich Merritt for giving players unauthorized kickbacks (paying them above the prevailing wage for babysitting, giving one athlete Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 21 and other athletic department officials about sexual harassment and disparate treatment for the women’s soccer team and women’s sports at UNR.  These complaints addressed inequities in locker room access and the scheduling of practice facilities as well as inequities in the salaries and employment perquisites like courtesy cars.140  Oddly, however, nowhere in the judge’s 36-page order of dismissal does he address Patraw’s Title IX retaliation claim as such.  Instead, he reasoned that her Title IX claim was not actionable because it failed to allege protected speech within the meaning of the First Amendment—a standard no court has applied to Title IX claims.141  In light of this clear divergence from other courts, the decision may be vulnerable on appeal, if one is forthcoming. D. Other Pending Cases 1. Feather River College Feather River College, a community college in Quincy, California, is presently defending charges of unlawful sex discrimination and retaliation in several lawsuits.  Two of the three plaintiffs are former athletic department personnel, including its former athletic director, Paul Thein, and its one-time women’s basketball coach, Laurel Wartluft.142  Thein and Wartluft had urged FRC President Susan Carroll to commit the college to Title IX compliance.  This would entail restructuring the way the athletic department raised and distributed funds for athletics, instituting parity in the classification and compensation of men’s and women’s coaches, and expanding opportunities for female athletes.  As a result of this advocacy,143 Wartluft, who had been serving as the interim women’s basketball coach, was passed over by the hiring  his personal frequent flyer miles) and gambling with his players.  Id. at 4-5.  Merritt, who has since resigned, was cleared of the gambling charge, but the NCAA continued to investigate the others.

Patraw Order, supra note 138, at 5-12.  Later in the order, while analyzing Patraw’s Equal Protection claim, the judge concluded that the university satisfactorily alleged permissible reasons for terminating her contract—specifically, that she had tendered and withdrawn her resignation on a number of past occasions and that she continued to dwell on a past, romantic relationship she had had with an assistant men’s basketball coach—but did not include any analysis of whether these reasons could have been pretextual under the familiar McDonnell-Douglas standard that courts regularly apply in Title IX retaliation cases, concluding only that Patraw had not offered specific evidence of pretext.

Coll. Dist., No. 2:07-cv-02023-FCD-GGH (E.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2007) [hereinafter Wartluft Complaint]. The third plaintiff is Michelle Jaureguito, formerly the federal grant director.  While her case does not relate to athletics, she reported to Thein, and Thein alleges that his termination is in part retaliation for his support of Jaureguito after she blew the whistle on a staff member who allegedly served alcohol to minors and engaged in sexual misconduct.

Meanwhile, an unscheduled review of Thein resulted in a negative evaluation, the first of his career, which Carroll then cited as the basis for her decision to place him on administrative leave for the remaining months of his contract. Thein and Wartluft have each brought Title IX-retaliation claims against FRC in federal court.146  Each has also sued FRC in state court under California’s Fair Housing and Employment Act.  In addition, both plaintiffs have filed claims with the California State Personnel Board, which has jurisdiction to adjudicate whistleblower complaints against state employers.147  The SPB held a hearing on Wartluft and Thein’s claims in the summer of 2007; the parties have submitted post-hearing pleadings and are currently awaiting the board’s decision. 2. Montana State University In 2004, Montana State University terminated head coach Robin Potera-Haskins after three years of successful service148 at the helm of the women’s basketball program.149  Potera-Haskins sued in June 2005, alleging that she was fired in retaliation for complaining about gender inequities within the athletic department.150  Specifically, Potera-Haskins had lodged regular protests with the athletic director and other senior officials about disparities in compensation (Potera-Haskins’s salary was 30% less than that of the men’s basketball coach) and support for the women’s basketball team in comparison to the men’s (including promotion and publicity, funding for hosting tournaments, and access to the weight training facility and medical trainers).151  MSU defended that Potera-Haskins was terminated because of her “abrasive” style that, while   144.

Moreover, Potera-Haskins alleges that she was targeted for retaliation because she resisted pressure from Athletic Director Peter Fields to offer a spot on the team to his daughter, a Division II player whose talent and physical ability Potera-Haskins did not believe was well-suited for Division I.  Potera-Haskins did eventually recruit Fields’s daughter to the team and awarded her a scholarship; she alleges the fear of reprisal from the Athletic Director motivated these decisions.

For example, after Potera-Haskins assigned Fields’s daughter to extra shooting practice, Fields curtailed such practices.  Potera-Haskins Complaint, supra note 148, at 10–11.

University of Tennessee at Martin In May 2008, Amy Draper, formerly the head volleyball coach at the University of Tennessee at Martin, sued the university in federal court.155  Draper alleges that she was terminated in retaliation for complaining to the athletic director about inferior treatment of her team and of female coaches.156  Such inferior treatment was evidenced by the volleyball team’s exclusion from the campus’s premier athletic facility, which resulted in the need to share a facility with intramurals and physical education classes.157  She also objected to what she perceived as discriminatory treatment by the assistant athletic director who serves as the Senior Women’s Administrator158 and to the department’s practice of requiring female coaches, but not male coaches, to have playing experience in the sports that they coach.159  Draper maintains that when she pointed out these gender disparities in an email to the athletic director, she was told that if she continued to make allegations of gender discrimination, he would “bring the curtain down” on her.160  She was eventually fired before the end of her contract and without a hearing, for reasons the university claims are related to her team’s “poor performance.”161  Draper alleges that this rationale, if true, constitutes a double standard, as the department chooses to retain several male coaches who have never had a winning season.162  This case is in discovery.  No dispositive motions have been filed, nor has a trial date been set.  4. Texas Southern University Surina Dixon sued Texas Southern University in October 2008, alleging that she was fired from the head women’s basketball coach position to which she had recently been hired after insisting on contract terms equivalent to that of the newly hired men’s basketball coach.163  The athletic director allegedly told Dixon   152.

It is argued that the legislation elevated the profile and status of women’s sports, with different impacts on men and women regarding leadership positions: greater prestige and compensation make such positions increasingly attractive to men, while simultaneously generating additional pressure, time, and travel demands that make those positions less attractive to women.169  Accordingly, a popular explanation for the gender gap in college coaching and administration is that women leave or avoid   164.

Today the number of intercollegiate women’s teams—9101, or 8.65 per school—is at an all-time high, but the percentage of female head coaches for women’s teams is 42.8%, only slightly higher than the lowest-ever 42.6% reported in 2006.  CARPENTER & ACOSTA, supra note 16.  Recent data showing that women have garnered only 10% of available head coaching positions for women’s intercollegiate teams since 2000 suggests that the gender gap is widening rather than closing.

Similarly, 35% of coaches ranked family commitments as the most common reason why women don’t go into coaching.  NAT’L COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS ASS’N, GENDER EQUITY IN COL. COACHING AND ADMIN.: PERCEIVED BARRIERS REPORT at 18, 20 (Jan. 2009); see also Rhode & Walker, supra note 47, at 24-25 (a higher percentage of female coaches (36%) than male coaches (19%) considered flexibility for family a “very important” or “most important” job resource); DRAGO ET AL., supra note 166, at 12-13, 18 (explaining that coaching is a profession with an “ideal worker norm” largely incompatible with family commitments and that those responsibilities still tend to disproportionately fall on women, while male coaches enjoy a “daddy privilege” in the form of “greater latitude to meet work/life demands either through having a spouse or because they were praised for attending to the needs of their family”). However, while it is clear that family considerations factor into women’s decisions to leave and enter coaching and athletics administration, there is also evidence to suggest that other considerations are equally or even more important.  For example, Rhode and Walker, supra note 47, at 27–28, report that 83% of coaches of women’s sports who responded to their survey agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “my job provides enough flexibility to allow me to take care of my familial and other personal responsibilities” and that there was no significant difference between male and female respondents.  By comparison, no other positive statements about the state of the athletic program received as much support; for example, only 62% agreed or strongly agreed that resources were allocated fairly between men’s and women’s athletics, and 56% agreed or strongly agreed that their programs received the resources necessary for success.  Id. at 28.  Moreover, other studies have found that male coaches are more likely than female coaches to leave coaching because of the job’s incompatibility with family life.

This is not to say that leadership positions in college athletics could not be made more family-friendly.  See, e.g., Rhode & Walker, supra note 47, at 41 (suggesting such measures as adequate family leave; flexible time commitments such as part-time, job-sharing, and flex-time initiatives; child-care subsidies and other assistance; and work schedules and meeting times that take into consideration coaches’ family obligations).  ` Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM 26 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 17:1 2010 department culture are also operating as obstacles to women’s participation and advancement in leadership positions in college athletics.  Significantly, none of the plaintiffs described in Part II claimed retaliation predicated on discrimination related to motherhood or family considerations.  This Part will examine the cases with common themes along these lines, and contextualize these themes within the existing empirical and theoretical scholarship examining women, leadership, and athletic department culture.  It will address the commonalities in the predicate discrimination (subpart A) and the retaliation itself (subpart B), as well as themes of double binds (subparts C and D), homophobia (subpart E), double standards (subpart F), and the meaning of women’s own participation in the discrimination and retaliation against other women (subpart G). A. Predicate Discrimination Relating to Employment Conditions and Discrimination Against Female Student Athletes Like Coach Jackson, all of the plaintiffs in the cases described above experienced retaliation (or alleged retaliation) after challenging ostensible violations of the Title IX regulations that prohibit discrimination in the number of or support for athletic opportunities afforded to students.  Associate Athletic Director Milutinovich (Fresno State), for example, alleged that she was targeted for retaliation after she challenged her athletic department’s failure to add opportunities for female athletes pursuant to its agreement with OCR.  Milutinovich, like Coach Wartluft and Director Thein (Feather River), and Coaches Flood and Vaughn (FGCU), challenged the general disparity in resources allocated to men’s and women’s athletics.174  Coach Vivas (Fresno State) and Coach Draper (Tennessee-Martin) alleged they had complained that their women’s teams could not access the university’s premier athletic facility on the same terms as men’s teams.175  Coaches Sulpizio and Bass (San Diego Mesa), Coach Schmidt (San Diego State) and Coach Patraw (University of Nevada, Reno) challenged impairments to their access to practice facilities.176  And Coach Crowe (Iowa State) sought a more equitable distribution of resources for recruiting.177  These coaches’ concerns about inequitable distribution of resources are consistent with empirical research demonstrating that this perception is shared by a significant percentage of coaches of women’s teams.178   174. 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c) (2009) (a university’s failure to provide necessary funds to members of one sex may be considered as a factor in assessing whether it has provided equal opportunities to both sexes).  175.

For context, coaches were more likely to agree with positive statements about job flexibility, availability of resources to individual athletes, coaches’ Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 27 In many of the cases included in the post-Jackson trend, employment discrimination claims are also the predicate for plaintiffs’ alleged or experienced retaliation.179  Lindy Vivas filed an internal grievance challenging the shorter contract terms and lower salaries afforded to female coaches.180  Merrily Dean Baker’s letter on behalf of the FGCU coaches contained a similar complaint.181  In addition, Ruth Crowe, Robin Potera-Haskins, Terri Patraw, Deena Deardurff Schmidt, Laurel Wartluft, and Surina Dixon all alleged that they experienced retaliation for challenging, among other things, the lower salaries and shorter contract terms they received relative to their male counterparts.182  Karen Moe Humphreys claimed she was targeted after challenging the discriminatory hiring practices within her department.183 In these ways, the cases are different from Coach Jackson’s, which did not include an employment discrimination claim.  In fact, it was the absence of a direct discrimination claim that made his case groundbreaking for establishing that Title IX protects a third party who is not a direct target of sex discrimination.  The fact that so many of the post-Jackson cases involve employment discrimination complaints as a predicate for retaliation exposes and underscores the discrimination female coaches perceive in the terms and conditions of their employment. This observation is also consistent with empirical evidence that women are over-represented in lower status, part-time coaching jobs184 and that they earn a lower wage per hour.185  And it is not necessarily the case that female coaches are self-selecting into positions with fewer hours.  For instance, one of Holly Vaughn’s complaints against FGCU for which she experienced retaliation was that she was not given the same opportunity as male coaches to take on additional job responsibilities that would have warranted greater job status and compensation.186 Moreover, the centrality of employment and programmatic discrimination to the narrative of these retaliation cases complements existing empirical research on the dearth of women coaches, which demonstrates a correlation between their perceptions of discrimination on the one hand, with lower job satisfaction and higher turnover on the other.187  For instance, one qualitative  access to mentoring and professional development, and support from the school’s administration than with statements about gender equity in resource allocation.

In addition, it sheds light on the career choices of women as they relate to leadership in women’s sports. B. Retaliation Against Coaches and Administrators Challenging Inequalities in Athletics After challenging some manner of sex discrimination in athletics—related to salary, other employment conditions, or the allocation of resources to women’s teams, as described above—all of the female coaches whose cases are examined here experienced some adverse consequence related to their employment.  These consequences included termination or nonrenewal (the Fresno State and FGCU plaintiffs, as well as Coaches Crowe, Schmidt, Potera-Haskins, Draper, Sulpizio, Bass, and Patraw), transfer to another department (Milutinovich), failure to promote or hire (Coaches Wartluft and Humphreys), falsified negative performance evaluations (Coaches Flood and Vaughn), and, in  coaches are less likely than their male counterparts to anticipate a long career in coaching, a finding the authors attributed to the female coaches’ perception of fewer opportunities for advancement); Michael Sagas & Frank B.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 29 two cases, an investigation for the purpose of generating an alternative ground for termination (Coaches Flood and Johnson-Klein). It is common for employees who challenge discrimination to experience retaliation because those who challenge discrimination are “transgressing the social order.”191  To those who benefit from privilege bestowed on the basis of race or sex, retaliation is an effective, and thus attractive, mechanism for sustaining the social order that creates that privilege.192 Retaliation operates to this end by raising the cost of speaking out against discrimination relative to the benefit of doing so.193  Especially in small professions like college athletics, the risk of losing one’s job is a particularly high cost because positions are competitive.  Moreover, the insularity of college athletics adds to the cost of challenging discrimination because it creates the possibility that the negative reputation as a troublemaker that a coach or administrator earns by whistleblowing194 could hinder her future job prospects. Another important characteristic of retaliation is that it is more likely to target individuals who are not part of the dominant class.195  Women and persons of color, historically marginalized from athletics, are thus particularly susceptible to reprisals when they challenge athletic departments’ discriminatory practices.  This is not to say that men do not object to sex discrimination or experience retaliation for doing so.  Coach Roderick Jackson’s case196 serves as a primary example of this point, as does Paul Thein’s case against Feather River College.197  Another example is a case which recently settled against University of California at Davis that was filed by former wrestling coach Michael Burch.  Burch was fired after—and arguably because—he advocated for the rights of women who wanted to continue to wrestle for the team after the university terminated female wrestling opportunities.198  And Kevin Wilson was not renewed to his position as head women’s basketball coach at Southern Oregon University after he protested discriminatory distribution of budget resources, access to facilities, office space, and other inequities; his Title IX retaliation claim also settled.199  Despite these cases in   191.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM 30 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 17:1 2010 which men were the plaintiffs, the fact that female plaintiffs have dominated the trend of retaliation cases post-Jackson (even though technically, the legal significance of the Jackson decision is to secure protection for those who are not also direct victims of sex discrimination200) is consistent with the view that members of the non-dominant group are more vulnerable to retaliation.201 Because retaliation works in the service of discrimination itself, and operates to the same end to secure the hierarchy of privilege, retaliation is “more likely to occur in organizations with a high tolerance for, and incidence of, discrimination.”202  The existing entitlement and privilege that inures to men’s sport, as well as its significant contribution to the gender order more generally,203 could explain an athletic department’s decision to favor males in the distribution of athletic opportunities to students, men’s teams in the distribution of resources, and male coaches in compensation, job security, and other benefits of employment.  For example, it is not surprising that the culture of Fresno State’s athletic department allowed for widespread Title IX violations in the form of inequities between men’s and women’s sports, backsliding on obligations to ameliorate the same, and reprisals against women in the athletic department who called that backsliding into question.  The correlative desire to retain sport as a male preserve and sustain that hegemonic privilege, and the high cultural stakes of doing so, suggests why an athletic department’s leadership would be threatened by, and thus retaliate, against women who seek to challenge it. C. The Retaliation/Job Performance Double Bind Having examined generally the nature of the predicate discrimination and the cultural context for the retaliation, this section examines how aspects of both  Buzuvis, June 24, 2009 (on file with author) (reporting that the Title IX retaliation claim “settled in favor of Mr. Wilson”).  200. See supra note 44.  201. Two other cases filed post-Jackson by male coaches also warrant mention here.  In one case, which is pending but has survived summary judgment, a male wrestling coach claims he was terminated (by a female athletic director) in retaliation for his advocacy of men’s wrestling.  Sabol v. Montclair State Univ., No. 06-3214 (DMC), 2008 WL 2354553, at *1 (D. N.J. June 3, 2008).  This is the only case I have found in which a male coach has claimed reprisal for challenging discrimination directed at men’s sports.  Though it is an outlier for this reason, the low status of wrestling among men’s sports lends support to the claim that members of the non-dominant class experience retaliation the most. In another case, the male plaintiff alleged a more typical basis for retaliatory termination — his advocacy for the women’s soccer program, which he coached.  However, the trial court dismissed his case after finding that the university’s decision not to renew his contract was instead triggered by numerous complaints about his negative attitude and intimidation of his players.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 31 operate simultaneously to pose obstacles to women’s success.  The relationship between these two mechanisms for discrimination consists of a double bind, in which coaches are punished not only for challenging discrimination in the allocation of resources to their programs, but also for failing to produce successful programs in a short time period, despite a discriminatory allocation of resources.204 This bind is exacerbated by discrimination in the length of contract terms, discussed in the previous section.205  Hiring and renewing coaches on a one- or two-year basis provides athletic departments with more frequent opportunities to replace coaches who are not living up to their expectations, which may include expectations to produce winning records or nationally ranked, highly competitive programs.206  For coaches without the job security of a longer-term contract, one bad season may be the difference between losing and keeping one’s job. A double bind is thus created when, in addition to the job pressure created by high expectations and a short-term contract, a coach is hamstrung by limited resources and support, insufficient access to training and practice facilities, an inadequate number of assistant coaches, insufficient access to scholarship dollars, and inadequate opportunity to attract recruits by competing in the school’s premier facility.  As the Fresno State and FGCU cases demonstrate, a coach who complains about either the length of her contract or the lack of support for her program puts her job at risk by appearing uncooperative, selfish, and difficult.  On the other hand, her job is rendered vulnerable by the fact that discrimination in the allocation of resources and support is itself a barrier to her team’s success.207  This vulnerability is exacerbated by a short period of contractual employment, which limits her opportunity to recover from isolated poor performance.  This double bind is perfectly illustrated in the lawsuit filed by Deena Deardurff Schmidt, who was expected to produce a successful swim team even in the absence of a pool.  San Diego State denied her the support she needed to achieve the benchmarks of success upon which she was being evaluated, and then fired her either because she advocated for more support (her allegation) or because she did not succeed (SDSU’s defense).  Amy Draper’s   204. Rhode & Walker, supra note 47, at 12-14 (providing statistics demonstrating that women are underrepresented among coaches whose teams make it to the NCAA tournament and national championships, and suggesting that female coaches’ lack of access to resources could be contributing to this disparity); id. at 33 (reporting that 59.8% of female coaches of women’s teams who responded to their survey thought that institutional support of female coaches was necessary for female coaches to succeed, in comparison to 31.5% of male coaches of women’s teams).  205. See supra Part III.A.  206. Confronted with charges of retaliation, many of the university-defendants in these cases defended that they were motivated instead by the coaches’ poor win-loss records (Fresno State, Tennessee-Martin, and San Diego State, for example) suggesting that such reasons, when true, are routine and acceptable.  207. See, e.g., Rhode & Walker, supra note 47, at 24 (reporting results of a survey of coaches of women’s sports, in which more than 90% identified institutional support and financial resources as “very important” or “most important” to a coach’s success); id. at 26 (reporting coaches’ open-ended responses such as “low funding means low performance” and “financial resources are by FAR, the most important item in any college sport.  Without equal across the board funding, a program cannot be expected to be highly competitive or of championship caliber.”). Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM 32 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 17:1 2010 case against Tennessee-Martin also reflects this theme, as she alleges that she was fired for lobbying for her team’s fair share of resources, and the university defends that she was in fact fired for “poor performance” after having a losing season.208 In sum, these cases suggest a tendency in athletic departments to essentially handicap female coaches by failing to provide their teams comparable resources and support, but holding them to the same or higher expectation to produce winning seasons.  Thus, a double bind is created when coaches risk being fired in retaliation for complaining about the resources they lack, when this dearth of resources or support undermines their teams’ performances and therefore negatively impacts their job evaluations.  This double bind, which seems to affect female coaches, may be seen as a barrier to women’s leadership in athletics and could even help explain women’s underrepresentation in this field. D. The Gender Conformity/Nonconformity Double Bind A second thematic double bind also emerges from the retaliation cases described in this Article: female coaches are exploited for gender conforming behavior and punished for gender nonconforming behavior.  Robin Potera-Haskins, for example, alleged that she was hired with the expectation that she produce a winning team.209  Though she succeeded in doing exactly that, she may have ultimately been punished for having an intense and competitive personality and the athletic director’s discomfort with her “abrasive” style.210  These characteristics are typical and acceptable among male coaches and administrators, but in Potera-Haskins’s case, may have been seen as gender nonconforming.  Similarly, Karen Moe Humphreys reported that her male supervisors at Berkeley criticized her for being “intimidating” and “too strong for a woman.”211  Had either of these women adopted a friendlier, more easy-going style, however, they might have earned personality points with their bosses, but would have jeopardized their continued employment in athletics, a field that places a premium on strength and competitive spirit.212   208. Draper Complaint, supra note 155, at 11.  Draper’s allegation that the Athletic Director had assured her that “winning is not the most important thing” as she endeavored to turn around a losing program belies the university’s claim that her termination was performance-related.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 33 The Fresno State plaintiffs also faced a version of this double bind.  Milutinovich, Vivas, and Wright all demonstrated gender nonconforming behavior213 by challenging the male leadership of the athletic department through their advocacy for gender equity.  As a result of speaking out, Milutinovich and Wright were marginalized as “the other team” and received punishment in the form of inferior salaries and contract terms; ultimately, job termination befell Milutinovich and Vivas for their actions.214  In contrast, Stacy Johnson-Klein was hired for her gender conforming and heterosexy appearance, which she likely felt pressure to retain due to the homophobic sentiments directed at gender nonconforming coaches.  But this approach did not protect Johnson-Klein from the subordination she, too, experienced in the form of sexual harassment and exploitation.215  These examples show how social expectations and stereotypes hamstring women in athletics.  For the coaches mentioned here, the operation of the gender nonconformity/conformity double bind resulted in negative employment consequences.  By creating additional obstacles for female coaches to maneuver, creating job dissatisfaction, and decreasing the amount of mental energy coaches have available to devote to other aspects of their jobs, the double bind may function as a barrier to women’s leadership in athletics.216 E. Homophobia and Discrimination on the Basis of Sexual Orientation Several cases involving the intersection of sex discrimination and sexual orientation discrimination demonstrate how gay-baiting and homophobia continue to be deployed as weapons against female coaches.  The litigation against Fresno State is rife with examples.  The jury in Lindy Vivas’s case validated her claim that she was discriminated against for her perceived sexual orientation after hearing testimony that the athletic director insisted female coaches play on the “home team” instead of the “other team,” a reference to the female coaches he apparently suspected were gay.217  According to witnesses, the athletic director had also said, “we need to get rid of the lesbians,”218 and that he had a “lesbian hit list” of coaches he wanted to terminate.219  He also tolerated a climate wherein it was acceptable for staff to “blar[e]” a talk radio program critical of Vivas and softball coach Margie Wright, a program in which the host made homophobic comments about them.220  This climate was such that the staff felt comfortable declaring “Ugly women’s athletes day” while   213.

After it became known that she had participated in the drafting of Merrily Dean Baker’s letter about gender discrimination in the athletic department, Flood was charged with having a relationship with a woman on a road trip and inappropriately touching a student by tugging on her shirt.222  The charge that ultimately resulted in her termination (which she denied and claimed was part of the retaliation against her) was that she had an “amorous” relationship with a female student.223  The lawsuits against San Diego Mesa College and Feather River College both contain allegations that the college officials were concerned about the image of athletic programs led by lesbian coaches, and the Mesa College plaintiffs allege that they were fired in part because the newspaper mentioned their lesbian relationship. In 1991, sport scholar Helen Lenskyj described the climate of college athletics as “so anti-woman, anti-lesbian and anti-feminist that most lesbians, whether athletes, coaches, administrators or faculty, remain invisible for reasons of simple survival.”224  Later, in 1998, Pat Griffin’s Strong Women, Deep Closets described the homophobic climate of athletic departments as either actively hostile toward lesbians (or those perceived to be lesbians) or “conditionally tolerant” of those who agree to cover their lesbianism and to adopt indicia of heterosexuality.225  The examples of homophobia presented in the contemporary retaliation cases discussed here suggest that, despite increasing public acceptance of gays and lesbians, elements of that same climate described by Lenskyj and Griffin still exist today.  The examples also provide support to the theoretical basis for the existence of homophobia in sport. One explanation for the persistence of homophobia in sport contexts including college athletics is that its primary purpose is not exclusion of gays and lesbians per se.  Rather, similar to the discrimination and double binds discussed above, it is a weapon in the service of sex discrimination.  Society is deeply invested in gender differentiation and hierarchy, and to that end, relies on sport as the context for creating and valorizing a hegemonic masculinity.226  Women’s sport in general is acceptable and accepted only to the extent it does   221. See supra note 80.  222. The shirt-tugging charge invokes homophobia because it likely derives from, and lends support to, the stereotype of predatory lesbian coaches.

The Fresno State athletic director’s comments on the hiring of Stacey Johnson-Klein, Feather River College’s failure to hire Laurel Wartluft, and Mesa College’s termination of coaches who were out in the newspaper, serve as examples of these tendencies and is consistent with other qualitative research along these same lines.228 It has also been suggested that the sporting world’s intolerance for lesbians allows the lesbian label to remain stigmatized and, thus, deployed as a powerful derogatory to intimidate women and control their experience in sport.229  As Griffin explains, the threat of the lesbian stigma can be used, for example, “to discourage the bonding that occurs among women in athletics” in order to “keep women from discovering their own power.”230  Thus, it is no surprise that anti-lesbian sentiment was present in two athletic departments—those of Florida Gulf Coast University and Fresno State—where female coaches and administrators were cooperating with each other and acted with the support of a high-ranking woman.  At FGCU, the female coaches and athletic director emerita Merrily Dean Baker worked together to present their concerns to the university administration.  Fresno State coaches Vivas and Wright, and eventually Johnson-Klein, received support and advocacy from Milutinovich while she was associate athletic director and even after she had been transferred out of the   227.

For example, after former Howard University basketball coach Sanya Tyler complained about gender inequities in her athletic department, rumors circulated that she received negative evaluations, stole money, and tried to get the university in trouble with the NCAA.  Yet it was the rumor that she was a lesbian, which also started at that time, that Tyler called “possibly . . . the most damaging thing said about me.”  Debra E. Blum, College Sports’ L-Word, CHRON.

Therefore, the lesbian label is used as a weapon of power to stigmatize female athletes and create dissention among them.”). While homophobia also exists in men’s sports, male coaches are not routinely subjected to antigay bias in the contexts of recruiting, hiring, and daily athletic department culture.

FGCU’s investigation of Flood on charges having to do with lesbianism233 could also be seen as an effort to make an example of her in order to threaten, control, and divide the group of women who sought to collectively surmount their powerlessness in the department. F. Double Standards Another theme that emerges from the retaliation cases is gender-based double standards for job performance.  Surina Dixon’s case against Texas Southern is particularly emblematic of this theme.  Dixon alleges that, despite being more qualified than a male coach hired at the same time, she was offered a lower salary and a shorter contract term than that male coach because she (but not he) had to “prove herself” to the athletic director.234  Similarly, Amy Draper complained that Tennessee-Martin held female coaches to a higher standard in two ways: first, by requiring only female coaches to have playing experience in the sports they coached, and second, by requiring female coaches, but not male coaches, to consistently have winning seasons.235  Karen Moe Humphreys’s case against U.C. Berkeley suggested that she and other women were passed over for promotions and subjected to layoffs despite seniority and experience, while men who lacked both were retained and promoted.236 Scholars have documented similar double standards in the hiring and retention of coaches.  For example, studies have found that female coaches are more likely than male coaches to have majored in physical education and to have intercollegiate playing experience.237  The hiring of men due to their work experience, despite women’s educational background and playing experience, demonstrates a double standard.238  Along that vein, female coaches, particularly younger ones, reported to focus group interviewers that they perceived having to work “twice as hard” as male counterparts in order to be taken seriously in their jobs.239  Such double standards contribute to a climate   231. While she was associate athletic director, and even after she was transferred out of athletics and to the student union, Milutinovich advocated for gender equity on behalf of coaches as well as players, including by filing complaints with OCR.  See, e.g., Jeff Davis, Advocate on Leave at CSUF: Fresno State Gender-Equity Proponent Says She’s Been Fired, FRESNO BEE, Aug. 3, 2006, at A1. After her termination, Milutinovich continued to support Vivas and Johnson-Klein by testifying for both plaintiffs at their trials.  E.g., Michele Kort, Full Court Press, MS.

G. Women Participating in Discrimination The cases against Fresno State and FGCU both suggest that women are more likely to be successful in their efforts to challenge sex discrimination in athletics when they cooperate with each other to this end.  The Fresno State plaintiffs, for example, worked together by testifying at each others’ trials,240 and collaborated with the Senior Woman Administrator, Assistant Athletic Director Diane Milutinovich, as they advocated for equal treatment for themselves and their teams.  At FGCU, the female coaches and assistant coaches worked with the athletic director emerita, Merrily Dean Baker, to present their concerns about gender equity to the department and university administration.241  But women in athletics are not always allies in disputes about sex discrimination.  Many of the cases highlighted in this Article involve evidence or charges of women in positions of power actively perpetuating the retaliation alleged.  For example, it appears that it was a female athletic department administrator at FGCU who laid the groundwork for Vaughn and Flood’s termination by putting falsified negative performance evaluations in their files.242  Coach Draper of Tennessee-Martin claims the Senior Woman Administrator was instrumental in the discriminatory treatment she and her team received.243  The female college president at Feather River College was accused both of firing her male athletic director and a female basketball coach who were trying to bring the athletic department into compliance with Title IX and of making homophobic statements about the coach.244  And a female athletic director was a named defendant in Terri Patraw’s suit against University of Nevada, Reno.245 While it is impossible to speculate on the specific motivations of individuals involved in the cases described, allegations of women perpetuating or supporting discrimination against other women provide an opportunity to consider how male privilege operates to entrench discrimination against women in athletics.  Women, too, may capitalize on male privilege by offering support to the existing gender hierarchy.  Moreover, they may have reason to believe that doing so is necessary for retention or consideration for promotion to positions of power (or at least, token positions of power).246  Because Title IX  field.”); see also Rhode & Walker, supra note 47, at 32 (some coaches responding to survey expressed that “women had to be ‘twice as hardworking’ and ‘twice as successful’ as male counterparts” in order to earn respect).  240.

In sum, the themes exposed by recently-filed retaliation cases reveal and underscore existing obstacles to women’s leadership in athletics.  In addition to exposing the fact and manner of retaliation coaches often face for speaking out against sex discrimination in athletics, such cases raise judicial and public awareness of themes inherent in the predicate discrimination itself.  Such themes include discrimination against women’s sports programs, employment discrimination, discrimination on the basis of gender nonconformity and sexual orientation, and pressure for female administrators and others to support and participate in such practices.  However, it is possible such exposure enables a remedy.  Thus, the remedial potential of the retaliation trend is examined in the next Part. PART IV LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE OF RETALIATION CASES To those who study sport and gender, the obstacles to women’s leadership in athletics described in Part III are neither surprising nor new.  What is significant, however, is that these issues are increasingly factoring into litigation and that several of those cases have produced verdicts and settlements favorable to plaintiffs.  The retaliation complaints filed in the wake of Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education are exposing judges and juries to double binds, double standards, homophobia, and other nuances of discrimination that sustain athletics leadership as a predominantly male enterprise.  For both legal and   247. E.g., Rhode & Walker, supra note 47, at 23–24 (coaches of women’s teams who responded to survey both reflected and challenged this viewpoint).  248. Cf.

E.g., SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, THE SECOND SEX xxvii (H.M. Parshley trans. Vintage Books ed. 1989).  250.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 39 practical reasons to be addressed in this Part, many of these situations would be difficult to remediate directly.  For issues involving compensation discrimination, sexual orientation discrimination, and programmatic discrimination, for example, the retaliation cause of action is helping expose and indirectly make schools accountable for conduct that might otherwise not be litigated because it is marginal, difficult to prove, or outweighed by the financial (and other) costs of bringing a legal challenge.  Thus, the right of action for retaliation operates to fill existing gaps in enforcement of Title IX and challenges to sex discrimination in athletics more broadly. A. Retaliation Claims and Pay Discrimination The increased profile of retaliation cases may give plaintiffs greater leverage to address disparities in compensation.251  While salary disparities between coaches of women’s and men’s teams252 and between female and male coaches253 are widespread and well-known, they have proven difficult to remediate in court.  Female coaches have sought to challenge salary disparities as sex discrimination under the Equal Pay Act254 and Title VII255 with mixed results.256  Both statutes prohibit employers from paying employees differently   251. See supra Part III.A.  252. See, e.g., NAT’L COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASS’N, 2004-06 NCAA REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF DIVISION I INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS REPORT 46, 47 (Mar. 2008), available at http:// www.ncaapublications.com/ProductsDetailView.aspx?sku=RE2008 (finding many examples of disparities in mean salaries for head coaches of men’s and women’s teams of the same sport—for example, among Division I, Football Bowl Subdivision (D-IA) schools, the mean head coach salary for lacrosse teams was $161,900 (men’s) and $80,200 (women’s); for gymnastics, $107,400 (men’s) and $89,200 (women’s); and for hockey $222,000 (men’s) and $129,600 (women’s)—figures that do not include endorsements and other payments coaches received from third parties, which skewed disparities even further).  253. See supra note 188.  254. The Equal Pay Act prohibits employers from paying employees at a rate less than employees of the opposite sex at the same establishment “for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions . . . ”  29 U.S.C. § 206(d)(1) (2006).  255. Title VII prohibits discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment, including compensation.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) (2006).  Instances of unequal pay for equal work that violate the Equal Pay Act will violate Title VII as well.  However, Title VII’s prohibition on wage discrimination goes further than the Equal Pay Act, and applies to all wage discrimination, such as, for example, a decision to offer bonuses or other benefits to male but not female coaches (regardless of whether the jobs are substantially equal).  Disparate hiring patterns that also create compensation disparities could also violate Title VII outside the context of an “equal pay for equal work” claim. Title IX regulations also require gender equity in the “assignment and compensation of coaches.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(6) (2009).  However, because these regulations address student athletes, the OCR does not consider the sex of the coaches in evaluating an institution’s compliance with these factors, only whether the coaching received by female athletes is comparable to that afforded to their male counterparts.  See VALERIE M. BONNETTE & LAMAR DANIEL, OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, TITLE IX INVESTIGATOR’S MANUAL 58 (1990).  256. Compare Hankinson v. Thomas County Sch. Sys., 257 Fed.

It is lawful for universities to offer higher salaries to coaches with greater job responsibilities due to larger rosters, bigger budgets, or greater travel obligations stemming from region of competition and recruiting.257  Moreover, differences in experience levels and the market value of the coach’s services may also justify a decision to compensate some coaches more than others.258  Though regulatory guidance suggests that differences between head coach positions that derive from sex discrimination do not justify unequal pay,259 it may be difficult to identify, parse out, and prove such discrimination.260  Moreover, courts can avoid considering the possibility that such discrimination exists by relying on other differences between the coaches or their positions to justify the disparity in pay.261 The difficulty and uncertainty surrounding pay discrimination cases likely deters plaintiffs from litigating them in many instances.  But because a retaliation case does not depend on whether the challenged practice constitutes actionable discrimination,262 a coach may be more likely to file suit when she can bring a retaliation claim as well.

See supra note 46 and accompanying text. Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 41 provides additional leverage that plaintiffs can use to negotiate for a favorable settlement.263 In addition, the availability of a remedy for retaliation deters universities from engaging in unlawful reprisal and therefore makes it safer for a coach to challenge her salary and employment conditions internally.  The potential for plaintiffs to win large jury verdicts and settlements in retaliation claims predicated on salary discrimination compels universities to contemplate the public, external costs of disparate salaries.  On a societal level, litigation challenging retaliation raises both judicial and public awareness of the underlying problem of unequal pay, which may help pressure universities to distribute salaries more evenly.  Given the relationship between salary and job satisfaction,264 the potential for retaliation cases to influence higher compensation for women coaches may in turn contribute to a solution to the gender gap in college coaching. B. Retaliation Claims and Homophobia and Sexual Orientation Discrimination Retaliation claims hold similar promise to address and mitigate homophobia and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in athletics.  While women in athletics, including coaches, have been disproportionately subjected to scrutiny for gender nonconformity and stigmatized by suspicions of lesbianism,265 litigation on this issue is exceedingly rare.266  A likely explanation is that homophobia manifests itself in subtle ways that are difficult to bolster with concrete evidence.  Without such proof, a plaintiff may assume the chances of victory are slim and decide not to bring suit. Another explanation for the absence of litigation in this realm is that the law affords very little reliable protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  Sexual orientation discrimination generally receives the lowest level of constitutional protection267 and is not categorically prohibited by   263. Cf. Rhode & Walker, supra note 47, at 18 (“Although pay discrimination cases are difficult to win, the prospect of litigation does give women coaches additional negotiation leverage.  And in many cases, when claims survive summary judgment, the result is a settlement that redresses some of the compensation disparity.”).  264. See supra note 190 and accompanying text.  265. See supra Parts III.D and E.  266. The only reported decision addressing discrimination against a lesbian coach, who was also a high school teacher, was decided on constitutional grounds.  A federal district court held that the school district that dismissed the coach from both positions because she was open about her sexual orientation violated her rights to free speech and equal protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  Weaver v. Nebo Sch. Dist., 29 F. Supp. 2d 1279, 1286, 1288-90 (D. Utah 1998).  Weaver’s lawsuit also included a retaliation claim, on which she also prevailed.  Id. at 1290-91.  267. The Equal Protection Clause, contained in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, prohibits state entities, including public universities, from discriminating against citizens on the basis of membership in a defined group or class.  In general, however, this doctrine affords little protection to gay and lesbian plaintiffs.  In contrast to discrimination on the basis of race and sex, which is only upheld if done for compelling or important purposes, state actors may permissibly treat gay and lesbian citizens differently so long as they proffer some rational basis for doing so.  Under this permissive standard, courts have upheld discrimination against gays and lesbians in the contexts of government employment, military service, adoption, and marriage.  See, e.g., Witt v. Dep’t of the Air Force, 527 F.3d 806 (9th Cir. 2008) (military service); Lofton v. Sec’y of Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM 42 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 17:1 2010 federal employment discrimination law268 or the antidiscrimination laws of many states.269  Courts may construe sex discrimination laws like Title VII and Title IX to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender nonconformity270—a potentially useful theory in the athletic context given the overlap between homophobia and sex stereotyping.271  But the fact that courts sometimes reject this theory or construe it narrowly272 likely affects plaintiffs’ confidence in the potential to remediate sexual orientation discrimination through litigation. Finally, the lesbian stigma itself likely causes coaches to be particularly risk averse in deciding to challenge homophobia in sport.  By bringing such a claim, a coach associates herself publically with lesbianism, which, so long as this is a stigmatized association in the field of athletics, compromises her future employability.273  With so much to lose, a coach could easily be dissuaded from filing suit by the legal and factual obstacles that a lawsuit would face.  But when she can bolster her sexual orientation discrimination claim with a retaliation claim imbued in the confidence that flows from multimillion dollar verdicts and settlements, she is more likely to do so.  Moreover, the fact that a jury validated  the Dep’t of Children and Family Servs., 358 F.3d 804 (11th Cir. 2004) (adoption); High Tech Gays v. Def. Indus. Sec. Clearance Office, 895 F.2d 563 (9th Cir. 1990) (federal employment); Hernandez v. Robles, 855 N.E.2d 1 (N.Y. 2006) (prohibition on same-sex marriage survives rational basis scrutiny under the New York Constitution’s equal protection clause).  See also David S. Cohen, Title IX: Beyond Equal Protection, 28 HARV. J. L. & GENDER 217, 256-57 (2005) (“Courts that have addressed equal protection claims based on sexual orientation discrimination in education have analyzed the school’s actions under the most basic equal protection standard, the rational basis test.  School action motivated by animus fails this rational basis test.  While no court has found a rational basis for indifference toward harassment based on sexual orientation, it is conceivable that courts would permit, under the Constitution, other forms of educational discrimination based on sexual orientation, as they have unfortunately permitted, under the Constitution, discrimination against gays and lesbians in other areas of the law.”).  268. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act, H.R. 3017, currently pending in Congress, would add sexual orientation and gender expression to the characteristics protected under federal employment discrimination law.  269. According to Lambda Legal, 20 states plus the District of Columbia prohibit private employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, while 28 ban such discrimination in the public sector, available at http://www.lambdalegal.org/states-regions/.  270. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 250 (1989) (plurality opinion) (“[A]n employer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that she must not be, has acted on the basis of gender.”); see also Anthony E. Varona & Jeffrey M. Monks, EN/Gendering Equality: Seeking Relief Under Title VII Against Employment Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation, 7 WM. & MARY J. WOMEN & L. 67, 131 (2000) (“Gender nonconformity standing alone, as in the Price Waterhouse case, can invoke Title VII relief, but typically not when it is combined with perceived or actual homosexuality.”).  271. Baird, supra note 212, at 60-61; supra Part III.E.  272. See, e.g., Jespersen v. Harrah’s Operating Co., 444 F.3d 1104, 1113 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc) (“Jespersen’s claim here materially differs from Hopkins’ claim in Price Waterhouse because Harrah’s grooming standards do not require Jespersen to conform to a stereotypical image that would objectively impede her ability to perform her job requirements as a bartender.”). The sex stereotyping rationale is also limited in the context of sexual orientation discrimination to cases involving gender nonconformity in appearance or behavior.  Same-sex orientation itself is not actionable gender nonconformity.  Vickers v. Fairfield Med. Ctr., 453 F.3d 757, 762-64 (6th Cir. 2006); see also Barbara Osborne, “No Drinking, No Drugs, No Lesbians”: Sexual Orientation Discrimination in Intercollegiate Athletics, 17 MARQ. SPORTS L.

Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 43 Coach Sulpizio’s retaliation claim but not her sexual orientation discrimination claim illustrates the relative difficulty in prevailing on sexual orientation discrimination claims and the value to plaintiffs in coupling them with retaliation claims.  As in the context of pay discrimination discussed above, retaliation claims operate to deter discrimination in this context as well.  This deterrence occurs by increasing the potential for litigation, which in turn raises the costs to universities of allowing athletic departments to maintain homophobic climates. C. Retaliation Claims and Equal Treatment Claims Retaliation claims also raise the potential for litigation about discrimination in the resources and support allocated to men’s and women’s athletics.  While women’s collegiate teams receive only about a third of the operating and recruiting funds allocated to men’s teams,274 the inequities resulting from such disparate funding, in such areas as facilities, equipment, publicity and promotion, and recruiting budgets,275 have yet to receive much attention from private litigants.  Most cases raising Title IX’s application to college athletic departments have challenged an inequitable distribution of athletic opportunities to men and women (so-called “equal access” claims), either due to a university’s decision to cut or demote an existing team276 or its failure to add new teams for which there is abundant interest.277  While OCR’s attention is increasingly drawn to issues related to the relative quality of those opportunities (so-called “equal treatment” claims),278 it is usually the monetary damages—or threat thereof—that come from private enforcement279 that are credited with   274. WOMEN’S SPORTS FOUNDATION, 2008 STATISTICS - GENDER EQUITY IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE ATHLETICS: MOST RECENT PARTICIPATION & BUDGET STATISTICS, available at http:// womenssportsfoundation.org (noting that female college athletes receive “36% of sports operating dollars, which is $1.55 billion less than male college athletes,” and “33% of athletic team recruitment spending, which is $50 million less recruiting female athletes than male athletes.”).  275. See Part III.A, supra.  276. Cohen v. Brown Univ., 101 F.3d 155 (1st Cir. 1996) (university’s decision to demote women’s gymnastics and volleyball to donor-funded varsity status violated Title IX); Roberts v. Colorado State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824 (10th Cir. 1993) (cutting varsity fast pitch women’s softball violated Title IX); Favia v. Indiana Univ. of Penn., 7 F.3d 332 (3d Cir. 1993) (affirming injunction to reinstate women’s varsity field hockey and gymnastics programs); Biediger v. Quinnipiac Univ., 616 F. Supp. 2d 277 (D. Conn. 2009) (injunction to preclude the elimination of women’s volleyball); Choike v. Slippery Rock Univ. of Penn., 2006 WL 2060576 (W.D.Pa. July 21, 2006) (ordering reinstatement of women’s varsity swimming and water polo).  277. Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213 F.3d 858 (5th Cir. 2000) (university’s failure to fund women’s fast-pitch softball and soccer violated Title IX).  278. Recently, for example, a complaint filed with OCR against the University of Alaska at Anchorage addressed disparities in the amount of locker room space allocated to men’s and women’s teams.  See Beth Bragg, UAA Hit with Title IX Complaint, THE ANCHORAGE DAILY NEWS, Oct. 29, 2008, available at http://www.adn.com/sports/story/571011.html.  In another example, an alumna’s complaint against the University of Charleston addressed the delays in the construction of a softball field, which was part of a gender inequity settlement between OCR and UC.  See Veronica Nett, Ex-UC Student Files Title IX Complaint, THE CHARLESTON GAZETTE, Mar. 15, 2008, at P8A.  279. Title IX’s private right of action extends to both injunctive relief and damages.  See Franklin v. Gwinnet County Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 76 (1992).  The sanction at stake in a public enforcement action by the Office for Civil Rights is termination of the educational institution’s federal funds.  Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM 44 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 17:1 2010 motivating universities to comply with Title IX and its implementing regulations.280  Equal treatment claims, however, have not been on the forefront of litigation seeking enforcement of Title IX, which has so far prioritized the lack of opportunity over inequities related to facilities, equipment, uniforms, promotion and publicity, and the like.281  Moreover, the cases in which student plaintiffs have raised equal treatment claims demonstrate such cases are vulnerable to early dismissal due to lack of standing,282 mootness,283 or failure to comply with the statute of limitations.284 Retaliation cases predicated on complaints about unequal treatment have the potential to bolster enforcement of this aspect of Title IX as well.  The availability of a remedy for retaliation predicated on such discrimination ensures that coaches can safely raise internal and external challenges to such disparities.285  Thus, after Jackson and in the wake of multi-million dollar jury verdicts and settlements awarded to coaches who experienced retaliation, a coach may feel more confident to speak freely about inequities to her Athletic Director, Title IX coordinator, or other appropriate university officials.286  Such protection may also bolster coaches’ participation in the self-study about gender equity (among other issues) that the NCAA requires of its member institutions,287 and it may give coaches more confidence to file a complaint with  However, owing to its “draconian” nature and the fact that it would deprive students of the very benefits of education OCR seeks to secure, this sanction has never been imposed.  Julie A. Davies & Lisa M. Bohon, Re-Imagining Public Enforcement of Title IX, 2007 BYU EDUC. & L.J. 25, 69-70 (2007).  Instead, OCR uses the threat of that sanction to secure prospective, corrective measures.  Id. at 41.  280. Deborah Brake & Elizabeth Catlin, The Path of Most Resistance: The Long Road to Title IX Compliance, 3 DUKE J. GENDER L. & POL’Y 51, 60-61 (1996) (“The threat of having to pay out large damage awards also promised to operate as a powerful incentive for schools to bring their athletic programs, as well as their other educational programs, into compliance with Title IX.”).  281. But see Haffer v. Temple Univ. of Commonwealth Sys. of Higher Educ., 678 F. Supp 517, 524-534 (E.D. Pa. 1987) (successfully challenging disparities in the distribution of athletic opportunities and in the funding of men’s and women’s athletics under the equal protection clause).  282. Boucher v. Syracuse Univ., 164 F.3d 113, 116 (2d Cir. 1999) (named plaintiffs, none of whom were varsity level, lacked standing to challenge unequal treatment in varsity programs).  283. Grandson v. Univ. of Minn., 272 F.3d 568, 574 (8th Cir. 2002) (dismissing challenge to unequal treatment in the distribution of scholarships and funding, to the extent it sought prospective relief, as moot upon players’ NCAA ineligibility or because they lacked varsity status, and also dismissing claim for monetary damages for plaintiffs’ failure to put university officials on notice).  284. Mansourian v. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Ca. at Davis, 2007 WL 3046034, *5-*9 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 18. 2007) (unequal treatment claim dismissed as untimely).  285. See Brake, supra note 46, at 78 (discussing the importance of protecting individuals who raise formal and informal objections to discrimination).  286. For example, Karen Moe Humphreys alleged that she experienced retaliation after complaining about gender discrimination to university officials investigating another coach’s claims of race discrimination.  See supra note 123.  287. For Division I institutions, the results of the self-study must be reported to the NCAA, whose approval is required for certification.  See generally NAT’L COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASS’N, 2008-09 DIVISION I ATHLETICS CERTIFICATION HANDBOOK (2008), available at http://www.ncaa.org/ wps/ncaa?key=/ncaa/NCAA/Legislation%20and%20Governance/Compliance/Certification%20and%20Training/Athletics%20Certification/index-d1_ath_cert_prog.  Division II and III schools must also conduct a self-study and generate a report that must be available to the NCAA upon request.  See generally NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASS’N, DIVISION II INSTITUTIONAL SELF-STUDY GUIDE (2008-2009) and DIVISION III INSTITUTIONAL SELF-STUDY GUIDE (2008-2009), available at Buzuvis_cpcxns.doc 5/5/2010  1:43:11 PM  SIDELINED 45 the Office for Civil Rights.288  And while internal and external complaints may originate with others, such as students and parents,289 it is particularly important that coaches avail themselves of those procedures without fear of reprisal.  Coaches are uniquely situated to perceive whether the resources their teams receive are adequate and fair and to present evidence of disparities.  Coaches also have greater incentive than students or parents to address inequities that require a longer time horizon to redress, such as those related to facilities.  Thus, ensuring that coaches can speak freely about programmatic disparities increases the likelihood that those disparities will be redressed. CONCLUSION The retaliation cases that have been litigated and filed in the wake of Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education are valuable for what they reveal about obstacles to women’s leadership in athletics.  Their early success provides grounds for cautious optimism in the potential for these cases to destabilize those institutionalized impediments.  With the momentum of multimillion dollar verdicts and settlements on their side, coaches are better situated now than ever before to seek remedies that will help ensure that the values college athletic departments are exercising and modeling include equal opportunity for the leadership of women.   http://www.ncaa.org/wps/ncaa?key=/ncaa/NCAA/Legislation%20and%20Governance/Compliance/Certification%20and%20Training/Self-study/issg.  288. OCR offers reassurance that its regulations prohibit retaliation against complainants and those who participate in any investigation or proceeding related to the complaint.  OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, HOW TO FILE A DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT WITH THE OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS 3, available at http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/howto.pdf; see also 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e) (2000).  It also conceals the identity of complainants.  See, e.g., Letter from OCR to Erin E. Buzuvis (on file with author) (redacting the names of complainants in documents transmitted in response to FOIA request for documents regarding OCR’s investigation of Fresno State, despite the fact that the identity of such individuals would likely be obvious to anyone with knowledge of the case).  These measures did not, for example, deter Fresno State from retaliating against coaches who filed complaints with OCR.  It is reasonable, therefore, to expect the availability of private enforcement and monetary damages to provide greater reassurance to coaches that their participation in OCR grievances is protected.  289. One does not have to be the victim of discrimination to file a complaint with OCR; anyone may do so.  OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS, supra note 288, at 2. ",
