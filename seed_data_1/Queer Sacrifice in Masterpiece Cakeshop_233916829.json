Ho∗   ABSTRACT  This Article interprets the Supreme Court’s 2018 decision, Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, as a critical extension of Derrick Bell’s interest convergence thesis into the LGBTQ movement.  Chiefly, Masterpiece reveals how the Court has been more willing to accommodate gay individuals who appear more assimilated and respectable—such as those who participated in the marriage equality decisions—than LGBTQ individuals who are less “mainstream” and whose exhibited queerness appear threatening to the heteronormative status quo.  When assimilated same-sex couples sought marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, their respectable personas facilitated the alignment between their interests to marry and the Court’s interest in affirming the primacy of marriage.  Masterpiece, however, demonstrates that when the litigants’ sexual identities seem less assimilated and more destabilizing to the status quo, the Court becomes much less inclined to protect them from discrimination and, in turn, reacts by reinforcing its interest to preserve the status quo—one that relies on religious freedoms to fortify heteronormativity.  To push this observation further, this Article explores how such failure of interest convergence in Masterpiece extends Derrick Bell’s thesis on involuntary racial sacrifice and fortuity into the LGBTQ context—arguing that essentially Masterpiece is an example of queer sacrifice.  Thus, using the appositeness of critical race thinking, this Article regards the reversal in Masterpiece as part of the contours of interest convergence, queer sacrifice, and fortuity in the LGBTQ movement.  Such observations ultimately prompt this Article to propose specific liberationist strategies that the movement ought to adopt in forging ahead.                                                  ∗  Associate Professor of Law, University of Massachusetts School of Law.

INTRODUCTION Despite equality in marriage for same-sex couples, the Supreme Court’s 2018 decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission1 illustrates that the dominant status quo is still able to pick and choose which moments to discriminate against sexual minorities.  This Article will show how the impasse from fully reaching sexual orientation antidiscrimination in Masterpiece is associated with the choices                                                  1 138 S.

Marriage equality is not true equality.  Marriage equality litigation purposely depicted same-sex couples as assimilated and distinctively aligned with the dominant status quo in order to increase the viability that the Court would extend marriage rights.2  In writing about Obergefell, others have noted that eventual success was premised on this carefully-crafted image of sameness, assimilation, and respectability because it allowed the interests of same-sex couples in seeking marriage rights to converge with the Court’s interests in affirming the heteronormative institution of marriage.3  Indeed, through such an interpretation of Obergefell, some have borrowed Derrick Bell’s well-regarded interest convergence thesis from critical race theory and applied it to explain how the Court reached its decision to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples.4   In examining Masterpiece, this Article affirms and then extends further such application of Bell’s thesis.  It explores Masterpiece as an example where interests failed to converge and what that failure signifies.  Deviating from its high regard for assimilated same-sex couples in Obergefell, the Masterpiece Court was unwilling to accommodate the less assimilated, less seemingly-respectable queer identities of the same-sex couple involved.  Instead, their queerness led the Court to reinforce interests in preserving the status quo—one that currently protects religious exercise over the rights of sexual minorities.  In this way, the Article will render further analogies to Derrick Bell’s racial justice theorizing—not only to his interest convergence thesis but also his later theories on involuntary racial sacrifice and fortuity—to explain how Masterpiece speaks profoundly about the current progress of LGBTQ rights in the post-marriage equality era.  Applying Bell’s theory of involuntary racial sacrifice, Masterpiece is ultimately a grave example of                                                  2 See generally Cynthia Godsoe, Perfect Plaintiffs, 125 Yale L.J.

Nevertheless, the Article will also use Bell’s theorizing to show invariably how sexual minorities ought to forge ahead.    Beyond this Introduction, Part II explores assimilationist strategies in both the gay movement and the marriage equality sub-movement that culminated in the proliferation of sameness and respectability archetypes that helped leverage marriage equality.  Part III first compares the assimilative characteristics of the same-sex couples from Obergefell against the queer sexualities of the Masterpiece couple.  Then Part III examines Masterpiece to show how the decision is an example of queer sacrifice and what this sacrifice indicates for LGBTQ equality going forward.  Finally, before Part V’s conclusion, Part IV uses guidance from Bell’s forged fortuity theory for solutions in the movement’s next steps beyond Masterpiece.  II.  ASSIMILATIONIST STRATEGIES IN MARRIAGE EQUALITY A.  ASSIMILATION VERSUS LIBERATION - HISTORICAL TENSIONS Questions of strategy have always embroiled themselves centrally in the social and political advancements of sexual minorities.  Even in earlier mid-20th century efforts, various incarnations of the American LGBTQ movement have pondered and taken sides between embracing assimilationist strategies, which insist on a rights-based perspective within the existing liberal democratic regime, and liberationist strategies, which assert change from a more revolutionary perspective outside the dominant political discourse.5  This basic tug-of-war between strategies famously ripped through the Mattachine Society, an early gay rights group that dominated over the homophile movement of the 1950s—a precursor movement of the contemporary LGBTQ crusade.6  Initially, the Mattachine Society embraced liberationist values and led the homophile movement by organizing a militant following, igniting participant self-                                                 5 CRAIG A.

After Stonewall, liberationist strategies gained more traction as gay and lesbian activism of the late 1960s transitioned to reflect the radical politics of the 1970s.16  Assimilationist strategies took a back-seat as the goal of many gay activists at the time was to revolutionize society and not merely change mainstream perceptions.17  During this time, the work of the Gay Liberation Front came to the forefront of the gay rights movement by challenging status quo.18  One of its noted works involved mainstream representations of sexual minorities through language and cultural imagery.  Known as “visibility rhetoric,” its use of language was important and essential for achieving the social group identity of gays and lesbians.19  For instance, the word “homosexual” was replaced with “gay,” and the consciousness of the group was reinforced with the word “pride.”20   But as activism for sexual minorities entered the 1980s and organizations within the movement began to play active roles in national politics—particularly as the AIDS crisis and the conservative Republican rise in the mainstream political sphere prompted the urgency for national presence—assimilationist strategies began to return to tactical prominence.21  Preference for assimilationist strategies deepened as marriage litigation in the early 1990s directed the gay movement toward marriage equality.22  In litigating and changing public reactions to same-sex marriages, activists shifted perceptions by crafting arguments for “sameness” between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships and by arguing for the human universality of being23—arguments                                                  16 Id. at 23. 17 Id. at 24. 18 Id. 19 Jacobs, supra n. __, at 725-26. 20 RIMMERMAN, FROM IDENTITY TO POLITICS, supra n. __, at 24.  21 Id. at 28-29. 22 Carlos A.

MARRIAGE AS ASSIMILATIONIST STRATEGY When it comes to marriage, the movement’s attachment to that idea has had a lengthy history and is nothing if not complex.  As Carlos Ball recounts, “[t]he question of marriage has been the subject of discussion and activism from the beginning of the LGBT rights movement in the United States.”25  Although deprived of the right to marry in the twentieth century, some accounts exists of same-sex couples taking part in symbolic marriage ceremonies over the decades prior to actualizing legal recognition of same-sex marriages.26  Then legal action took  shape.  In the 1970s, same-sex couples in several states across the U.S. also initiated lawsuits to obtain the right to marry.27  At that time, during the liberationist heyday, the underlying purpose of these lawsuits focused more on the legal participation that marriage would afford sexual minorities rather than any integrationist notions of becoming part of the mainstream.28  Exclusion from marriage meant that the rights and incidents of marriage enjoyed by wedded opposite-sex couples eluded same-sex couples.29  Such desire for equal treatment was often the actual goal of these early same-sex marriage suits, rather than folding sexual minorities into the social fabric.30  Unfortunately, none of the same-sex couples who sued for the right to marry ever prevailed in these early efforts—including Baker v. Nelson, which was denied certiorari review by the Supreme Court.31                                                                             24 Elizabeth J.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. Notwithstanding feminist critiques of marriage as a patriarchal institution, gay rights thinkers also exhibited apprehension toward marriage.  The now-classic 1989 debate between Paula Ettelbrick and Tom Stoddard published in Out/Look Magazine exposes the assimilationist-versus-liberationist tensions that activism and ultimately obtaining the right to marry would bring.32  Ettelbrick and Stoddard were both colleagues at the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, but shared profound differences on the idea of same-sex marriage.33  Ettelbrick held views against same-sex marriage while Stoddard possessed favorable ones.34  Their debate illustrated quite succinctly but effectively some of the fundamental assimilationist-versus-liberationist perspectives on same-sex marriage. Though not completely agreeable with the institution of marriage, Stoddard took the position “that every lesbian and gay man should have the right to marry the same-sex partner of his or her choice, and that the gay rights movement should aggressively seek full legal recognition for same-sex marriages.”35  He then underscored his strong belief through practical, political, and philosophical explanations that all more-or-less illustrate how marriage would uphold and integrate same-sex couples within mainstream society.36    But from the liberationist view, Ettelbrick articulated her anti-marriage stance by criticizing the importance of “self-affirmation” that many gay couples ideally seek through marriage.37  She understood the appeal:  “After all, those who marry can be instantaneously transformed from ‘outsiders’ to                                                  32 Paula L.

In other words, gay marriage will not topple the system that allows only the privileged few to obtain decent health care. Nor will it close the privilege gap between those who are married and those who are not.44                                                  38 Id. 39 Id. at 10, 14. 40 Id. at 14. 41 Id. at 15. 42 Id.  43 Id. 44 Id. at 16. 10         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. Prophetically, Ettelbrick also predicted the decline in gay political advancement once marriage is obtained:  “If the laws change tomorrow and lesbians and gay men were allowed to marry, where would we find the incentive to continue the progressive movement we have started that is pushing for societal and legal recognition of all kinds of family relationships?”45  All in all, her reasons against pursuing marriage were predominantly pointed at how it would subordinate sexual minorities underneath a multidimensional, white heteronormative supremacy both externally and within the movement.   In pre-Obergefell 1989, the Stoddard-Ettelbrick pro-and-con debate in Out/Look Magazine illuminated profound complications that the idea of marriage underscored between assimilationist and liberationist strategies for the movement as a whole.  But in light of any efforts to resist conformity and assimilation, marriage equality activism began to advance shortly around the time the Stoddard-Ettelbrick debate was published.46  Despite latency for more than a decade, interest in advancing same-sex marriage came about consequentially from the impact that the AIDS epidemic pressed upon inheritance and death benefits issues of sexual minorities.47  In 1989, the State Bar Association of California recommended legally recognizing same-sex marriages.48  Then in the early 1990s, marriage litigation that began in Hawaii eventually led to the temporary success of Baehr v. Lewin,49 where the Hawaii Supreme Court recognized that denying same-sex couples the right to marry could be unconstitutional.50  The surprise success of Baehr, however slight, brought frenzy to both social conservatives and gay rights proponents.51  According to Carlos Ball, post-Baehr “a growing number of LGBT rights organizations, facing both the surprising                                                  45 Id. at 17. 46 See, e.g., Philip S.

As Ettelbrick predicted, the drive toward marriage equality was eventually fueled by a prevalent class within the LGBTQ movement at the cost of intra-group marginalization.     C.  ASSIMILATIONIST STRATEGIES AND INTEREST CONVERGENCE While Obergefell was being heard at the Supreme Court—just a little more than two decades after Baehr—the effects of assimilationist strategies in the marriage equality and gay rights movements had continued to crystallize.  Ettelbrick’s noted disparity had, indeed, persisted.  Mere months before the Obergefell decision, Alexander Nourafshan and Angela Onwuachi-Willig echoed what other scholars had articulated—that successes in gay rights advancement in pursuing marriage had incurred an unfortunate cost to the movement itself.57   According to Nourafshan and Onwuachi-Willig, in championing marriage, movement proponents had, historically throughout the struggle up to Obergefell, embraced assimilationist tactics over liberationist ones:  “[R]ather than seek to disrupt the paradigm of heteronormativity, assimilation-oriented homosexuals sought to fit gay rights into the existing legal and social structure, without threatening to upend the social order.”58  The consequences might have made some in-roads toward formal equality, but the progress retained—if not deepened—some substantial limits for the movement as a whole:   Although Windsor and the revolution of cases that have led to Obergefell [sic] hold significant promise for one privileged subset of gays and lesbians—white, economically privileged, and educated gays and lesbians—they do not necessarily carry the same potential for less privileged subgroups within the gay and lesbian community, namely gays and lesbians of color.59                                                    57 Alexander Nourafshan & Angela Onwuachi-Willig, From Outsider to Insider and Outsider Again: Interest Convergence and the Normalization of LGBT Identity, 42 FLA.

Others have similarly discerned, before and since Obergefell, that the assimilative push for equality in marriage was ironically done through channeling some important disparities within the gay community and movement.  According to Kathrine Franke, “[i]n the marriage cases, lesbians and gay men have accomplished a rebranding of what it means to be homosexual.”60  Through what she calls “just like us” arguments that connote sameness to the mainstream,61 that sameness connotation has eventually led to the prevailing use of whiteness in marriage litigation’s rebranding of the gay identity.62  Consequently, she posits that marriage became “publicly perceived to be a white issue” and the marriage equality movement itself “specifically enjoy a kind of racial privilege that has underwritten the plausibility of this positive transformation in the meaning of gay identity.”63  Even before the 2003 success in Massachusetts through Goodridge, Darren Lenard Hutchinson had referenced what some scholars on race were already saying about the same-sex marriage movement in the U.S.—the apprehension “that many (or most) of the benefits from same-sex marriage will accrue to white and upper-class individuals.”64   Nourafshan and Onwuachi-Willig also contend that the assimilationist strategies in marriage equality became a vehicle for a dominant sexual minority group—one that projected a white, upper-middle class image to emerge with its interests (including marriage) as representative of the rest of the sexual minority population.65  They direct their findings at the sameness arguments.66  Although the movement obtained some progress on social issues such as marriage, the collateral result is that “[t]he movement’s portrayal of gay identity as white, wealthy, and educated has created a race-based insider identity for white                                                  60 Katherine Franke, What Marriage Equality Teaches Us: The Afterlife of Racism and Homophobia, in Ball, supra n. __, at 247. 61 Id. at 249-50.  62 Id. at 250. 63 Id. at 251. 64 Darren Lenard Hutchinson, \"Gay Rights\" for \"Gay Whites\" ?: Race, Sexual Identity, and Equal Protection Discourse, 85 CORNELL L.

The saliency of this result is itself not hard to perceive.  Indeed, even in 1989 before the advancement of marriage equality, Ettelbrick had predicted the racial and economic subordination of sexual minorities through obtaining the right to marry.  Borrowing from Derrick Bell’s racial justice theorizing, his interest convergence theory helps illuminate the correlation between assimilationist strategies in the marriage movement and marginalizing effects on sexual minorities.69  In theorizing racial inequality, Bell posited that the recognition of legal rights of those subordinated only occur upon convincing the white decisionmakers that the interests of both groups converge.70  At the start of the marriage movement, sexual minorities vying for the right to marry appeared as outsiders attempting to appease the heterosexual mainstream who have the ability to marry and the power to extend the right to marry.  Proponents and movement activists abandoned liberationist, outsider rhetoric to reach for sameness arguments, which revised pronouncements that same-sex couples could love, have relationships, or rear children well enough to deserve the rights and benefits of marriage to be “just like you.”  Assimilationist accounts of sameness were predicated on how identical same-sex couples were to the heterosexual couples—how they would be unlikely to threaten the status quo.  Once the establishment was convinced of the sameness, sexual minorities were granted the right to marry.  In this way, making marriage equality appear as a “white issue” facilitated sameness arguments and also aligned the interests of between sexual minorities and the power-granting establishment.

Anthony Michael Kreis has drawn several accounts that reveal the impact of interest convergence in recent gay rights advances.73  Reading together Justice Scalia’s dissent in Romer v. Evans74 and Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion in Lawrence v. Texas,75 Kreis argues that the Supreme Court’s reversal of Bowers v. Hardwick76 involved several layers of interest convergence.  With Romer, Kreis has discerned that Scalia’s scathing dissent was a reaction to the undercurrent of white privilege that helped convince the majority of Amendment 2’s animus:  “[Scalia’s] intent was surely to highlight that the LGBT community is a powerful and visible force within the legal community and that visibility makes it easier for his fellow Justices to grant rights to a group of people with whom lawyers typically associate.”77  Sameness facilitated Romer’s outcome.  Kreis then pairs the resonance of Scalia’s Romer dissent with the passage in Kennedy’s majority opinion in Lawrence, when sameness was used to connote the discriminatory effect of sodomy laws.78  As Kennedy distinguished the facts of the case from a case that might have involved minors, nonconsensual sex, public indecency, prostitution, or legal recognition of same-sex relationships, he stated that Lawrence, on the contrary, “involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle.”79  As such, “[t]he petitioners are entitled to                                                  71 Franke, supra n. __, at 250. 72 Id. 73 See generally Kreis, supra n. __. 74 517 U.S. 620 (1996). 75 539 U.S. 558 (2003). 76 478 U.S. 186 (1986). 77 Kreis, supra n. __, at 148. 78 Id. at 149. 79 Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578; see also Kreis, supra n.__, at 149. 16         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

The petitioners were just having consensual sex.  What’s the harm in that?  At the same time, Kennedy seems to show how the petititoners’ interests aligned with the decision-making establishment because, according to Kreis, the passage “emphasizes that there is no harm to heteronormative norms with the majority’s decision.”83  Furthermore, by the time Lawrence weighed the legality of same-sex intimacy, other heteronormative institutions that might have been once threatened by the overturning of Bowers—such as religious organizations—already had such threats “neutralized” in other Supreme Court decisions.84  Such neutralization of threats that Lawrence might have posed further demonstrated the aligning of interests that helped reverse Bowers: “The Bowers, Romer, and Lawrence opinions are strong evidence that once shared identity interests are realized, judicial remedies favoring sexual minorities will be authorized provided they do not undermine the power or authority of peer heterosexual stakeholders.”85  In other words, the legal protections sexual minorities were asking for can be granted so long as such protections would not threaten the heteronormative status quo.      Similarly, Nourafshan and Onwuachi-Willig illustrate one particularly glaring instance of interest convergence in U.S. v. Windsor86:                                                   80 Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578; see also Kreis, supra n.__, at 149. 81 Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578.  82 Id. 83 Kreis, supra n.__, at 149. 84 Id. at150. 85 Id. at151. 86 Nourafshan & Onwuachi-Willig, supra n. __, at 522-23; 133 S.

Under the theory of interest convergence, Edith Windsor, a wealthy, white woman in a long-term committed relationship in New York City, was, in many ways, the perfect plaintiff to challenge DOMA because she could be sold as part of a respectable, assimilation-based gay image to the general public and, more importantly, to those in power.87 Particular aspects of Windsor’s marriage to her deceased spouse Thea Spyer seemed conducive for drawing sameness arguments.  According to Nourafshan and Onwuachi-Willig, Windsor’s “wedding was ‘mainstream’ enough to be featured in the New York Times wedding section, even though the state of New York did not recognize same-sex marriage until 2012.”88  In addition, “[b]oth Windsor, who holds a Master’s degree from N.Y.U., and Spyer, who has a Ph.D., have elite pedigrees in terms of education.”89  The combination of these attributes made the conclusion viable that “Edie Windsor closely hues to the image of homosexuality that has been consciously crafted in the public sphere.”90  Beyond the ways her identity could be construed as “conforming to society’s perceived normative ideal in all ways expect for sexuality,”91 the financial losses associated with how the Defense of Marriage Act discriminated against her state-recognized marriage on the federal level (charging her $363,053 in estate taxes) made her “sympathetic.”92  In deconstructing the image that Windsor presented, Nourafshan and Onwuachi-Willig tease out the converging interests.  Windsor’s estate taxes dispute could be “highly salient to white elites, both gay and non-gay alike.”93  Her “respectability-based identity as a lesbian represented a departure from the stereotype of hyper-sexuality that is often affiliated with or imputed to gay culture.”94                                                   87 Nourafshan & Onwuachi-Willig, supra n. __, at 522. 88 Id. at 522 n. 7. 89 Id. 90 Id. 91 Id. at 523. 92 Id. 93 Id. 94 Id. 18         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

Windsor’s “racial identity as a white woman reified the primacy of whiteness in the gay community and gay rights movement.”95  Not to mention, “her identity as an educated Northerner reinforced notions of sophistication and assimilation in the gay and lesbian community.”96  Combined together, these attributes “helped to remove the stigma of otherness (to an extent) and thus enabled broad swaths of people to identify with her.”97  Of course, according to Nourafshan and Onwuachi-Willig, aligning interests between Windsor and the establishment here also created the inverse problem—using her attributes to draw similarities in interest “also implicitly worked to mark those who did not fit this normative ideal as outsiders.”98 D. THE OBERGEFELL COUPLES  In examining Obergefell plaintiffs, Cynthia Godsoe has noted that attorneys’ strategies in managing their plaintiffs’ “ordinariness” and “approachability” hinged on portraying a sense of normality.99  Animating both the selection of the twenty-nine Obergefell plaintiffs and their performance of attributes, the strategy of being normal was targeted chiefly toward members of the Court in ways that maximized and ensured sufficient interest convergence that would render positive outcomes:   [T]he Supreme Court is mainstream in its own way, composed of nine individuals from a very narrow slice of the population. Skilled advocates “play by its rules, and tell the Justices stories they like to hear about people who remind them of themselves.”  In other words, plaintiffs should assimilate to norms that the Justices understand and their lawyers should play down differences.100                                                   95 Id. 96 Id. 97 Id. 98 Id. 99 Godsoe, supra n. __, at 136. 100 Id. at 136-40 (footnotes omitted) (quoting Dahlai Lithwick, Extreme Makeover: The Story Behind the Story of Lawrence v.

In doing so, Godsoe observes that result of such elaborate perception-building “reveals some deep-rooted assumptions about what a family should look like and what is an appropriate path to social change.”101  Assimilationist strategies would likely fit that path.  According to Godsoe’s research, the Obergefell plaintiffs were “largely homogenous and non-representative of LGB families,”102 and their similarities and attributes can be categorized and compiled into to an archetypal scheme.  Though self-identified as sexual minorities, the Obergefell plaintiffs appear to Godsoe to share four common traits; they are (1) typically all-American, (2) asexual, (3) devoted to childrearing and/or caregiving, and (4) accidentally political.103   What Godsoe describes as “all-American” is synonymous with “reflect[ing] a traditional ‘Leave it to Beaver’ American ideal”104 typified by their “overwhelmingly white and middle or upper-middle class”105 composition that is “starkly different than the gay and lesbian population.”106  In fact, only five Obergefell plaintiffs are white, and out of sixteen couples, just three are racially mixed.107  These ratios amongst the Obergefell plaintiffs here are incongruous and unrepresentative of the racial breakdown in LGBT population as Godsoe reports.108  Moreover, to continue building their all-American features, Godsoe notes that they “all have eminently respectable jobs.”109  She illuminates this all-Americanness using one particular example of an actual Obergefell plaintiff-couple:  “[T]wo attractive veterinary professors who were recruited because they are ‘in a stable, good relationship,’ and are ‘likeable’ ‘homeowners’ with respectable jobs.”110  In other words, using Godsoe’s own synonym for all-American, the Obergefell plaintiffs are more or less                                                  101 Id. at 140. 102 Id. at 145. 103 Id. 104 Id.  105 Id.  106 Id.  107 Id.  108 See id. at 139. 109 Id. at 146. 110 Id. at 138.  20         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

There are no transpeople or HIV-positive individuals amongst these plaintiffs.112  Nor did these litigants possess less-seemingly “respectable” jobs, characteristics, or backgrounds that would label them alternative from the mainstream in some way.113  They are overwhelmingly white and privileged, and present themselves and their families as “ ‘do[ing] exactly the same things as everyone else does,’ ”114 or they consider themselves “ ‘just as boring and crazy and loud as any other family.’ ”115  In essence, one can alternatively designate what Godsoe identifies as “all-American” or “mainstream” in the Obergefell plaintiffs as assimilated characteristics.    Likewise, Godsoe noted that Obergefell plaintiffs were “asexual” or de-sexualized116—meaning that their highly-crafted image avoided the stereotypical notions of gay promiscuity or even reminded the public or the Court of non-heteronormative sex:  “Not one of the many photographs and videos available online depict a plaintiff kissing his or her partner.  Sex is never mentioned.”117  Rather their “asexual” images portray monogamous couples committed in their relationships to one-another.118  To borrow from Kreis’ observations regarding interest convergence from Lawrence,119 the de-sexualization of plaintiffs here likely serves to signal and underscore their non-threatening nature—how the qualities of their same-sex relationships (which would include aspects of sex and sexual intimacy) would not threaten the establishment’s social order.  The irony here is that the Obergefell attorneys’ needed to de-sexualize their plaintiffs before the public and the Justices despite the progress already                                                  111 Id. at 145. 112 Id.  113 Id.

Simultaneously, the move also appears regressive as if intended to avoid the connotations that sodomy in Bowers had engendered122 or perhaps reach back further to early same-sex marriage cases when the primacy of procreative sex quashed any advancement of granting same-sex couples the right to marry.123  All in all, the prophylactic move to de-sexualize Obergefell plaintiffs seemed aimed to neutralize any indication of threat to the mainstream social order.    According to Godsoe, the Obergefell plaintiffs were also engaged in childrearing at a degree much higher than statistics for the sexual minority population, or, if they did not have children, was often engaged in caretaking responsibilities for either their partners or parents.124  Godsoe observed that caregiving “not only further desexualizes LGB relationship, but also entrenches the privatization of dependency, exempting the state from responsibility for supporting the disabled and children.”125  But not only does caregiving facilitates the “reward” for receiving legal recognition of marriage, as Godsoe describes,126 the use of childrearing and caregiving also aligns the interests of sexual minorities with the establishment by again minimizing same-sex relationships as non-threatening and appearing to hold                                                  120 539 U.S. at 566-79. 121 Dale Carpenter, The Unknown Past of Lawrence v.

One is reminded by the quote from House of Cards:  “Everyone can get behind children.”127  This suggestion remains even if the Obergefell plaintiffs overstate the prevalence of childrearing amongst the sexual minority population.128             Finally, Godsoe perceives Obergefell plaintiffs as political outsiders, calling them “Accidental Activists.”129  Indeed, “[t]he final ingredient in the perfect plaintiff [in Obergefell] is a disdain for politics.  The Obergefell plaintiffs have been cast as ‘ordinary’ folks who just happened to get involved[.]”130  They claim not to be “activists” but just interested in their private existence.131  Yet, their apolitical nature seems disingenuous to Godsoe, who notes their public involvement with the press, appearances at advocacy events, contributions to the media, and attendance at Supreme Court arguments once they were selected as plaintiffs.132  Again, the “apolitical” narratives seem to lessen any “activist” connotations, perhaps adding to their non-threatening personas.    All in all, Godsoe’s intricate scholarship here on the Obergefell plaintiffs details motivated interest convergence that underscores the reason why attorneys opted for an assimilationist strategy—one that complements and proves on a litigative scale Katherine Franke’s remark about the collateral rebranding of the gay identity by the movement’s focus on obtaining marriage equality.133  Franke’s observations about racial marginalization in the marriage litigation also match Godsoe’s on Obergefell:  “When the lawyers and the clients in the gay marriage cases stand on the steps of the Supreme Court after arguing their case for marriage equality, all, or nearly all, of them are white.”134  Major coverage of recent marriage cases feature white individuals as plaintiffs and attorneys; noted leaders at major gay  organizations                                                  127 House of Cards: Chapter 1 (Netflix Feb. 1, 2013). 128 Godsoe, supra n. __, at 149. 129 Id. at 150. 130 Id. 131 Id. at 151. 132 Id. at 151-52 (“They protest too much.”) 133 Franke, supra n. __, at 247. 134 Id. at 251. 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    23   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

HIERARCHICAL EFFECTS If Franke and others are correct that the assimilationist strategy in advancing toward marriage equality succeeded in rebranding the perception of the gay identity as predominately white, upper-middle class, then this result leaves out a substantial reality about the sexual minority population as a whole.  Amongst the LGBTQ population, racial and economic stratification mirrors that of the general population in the U.S.138  For better or worse, with marriage having arisen as the top priority of the gay rights movement in the last two decades, a skewed representation of the gay identity has emerged to help obtain formal equality at the expense of underprivileged voices in the sexual minority population.  The problem is multifold.  First, such success in formal equality using assimilationist strategies has, in essence, led to the replication of racial and underprivileged subordination within the architecture of such formal equality established in cases such as Windsor and Obergefell.  On the one hand, the sameness arguments and interest convergence have only gotten the movement so far.  In Windsor, Kennedy essentially replicated and extended his use of rationality with bite from Romer.139  While in Obergefell, he                                                  135 Id.  136 Obergefell, 135 S.

The encasement of hierarchy and privilege within advances for formal equality for sexual minorities makes such formal equality, once obtained, less than ideal—somewhat pernicious even—as a form of equality.  Of course, same-sex couples do receive benefits through marriage.  But because marriage was achieved through assimilationist strategies that aligned interests between privileged sexual minorities and the establishment, such achievements carry with them a certain level of taint.  Internally amongst sexual minorities, assimilationist strategies that accomplished, in part, the rebranding of the gay identity for the mainstream have also committed erasure for non-white, intersectional sexual minorities.  For instance, as Nourafshan and Onuachi-Willig noted, the assimilationist, sameness strategies used in Windsor “enabled broad swaths of people to identify with [Edith Windsor]” but “also implicitly worked to mark those who did not fit this normative ideal as outsiders.”143  As Stewart Chang has remarked, “[w]hen formal                                                  140 See 135 S.

Going forth, assimilationist strategies here will prove to be an obstacle in future advances for true equality.  First, according to Kreis’ take on Bell’s interest convergence, gay rights will only prevail so long as interests are aligned and reparations for discrimination do not disturb the status quo.146  Because the interests of sexual minorities who do not appear assimilated do challenge establishment norms—whether racially, economically, or otherwise—further advances in the areas of employment and housing discrimination, where intersectional members are affected more often, will likely face stagnancy.  Such a result means that the progress for advancing sexual minorities has stalled since Obergefell and will likely taper unless a transformative strategy intervenes.  As Part III will show, that stagnancy is apparent in aspects of the Masterpiece decision.    III.  UNALIGNED INTERESTS IN MASTERPIECE  The Masterpiece dispute originated in 2012 when Charlie Craig and David Mullins,  a Colorado same-sex couple, tried to order a custom-made wedding cake from Masterpiece Cakeshop and its owner-baker, Jack Phillips.147  Because Colorado did not recognize same-sex marriages at the time, Craig and Mullins had planned to marry lawfully in Massachusetts and then return to Colorado to celebrate their out-of-state marriage.148  A custom-ordered wedding cake from Phillip’s shop would have been part of that celebration.149  Upon hearing that Craig and Mullins wanted                                                  144 Stewart Chang, Is Gay the New Asian?:  Marriage Equality and the Dawn of a New Model Minority, 23 ASIAN AM.

QUEERING THE RESPONDENTS In contrast to the assimilated and mainstream identities that the same-sex couples projected during the Obergefell litigation, the same-sex couple in Masterpiece did not appear as readily assimilated when they engaged in their legal battles over an instance of alleged sexual orientation discrimination.   Although Craig and Mullins are both racially white and male, they did not share many of the other “normalized” similarities with the Obergefell plaintiffs.  Substantially missing from Craig and Mullins’ public personas were characteristics that would have easily fallen within any of Godsoe’s four archetypal traits of gay assimilation in Obergefell: (1) projections of all-Americanness; (2)                                                  150 Id. 151 Id. at 1723. 152 Id.  153 Id. 154 Id. at 1723-24. 155 Id. 156 Id. 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    27   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

Not Mainstream All-American  First, the couple here appears less mainstream or “all-American” than the Obergefell plaintiffs.  Neither of them have jobs or careers that would survive a judgmental, status-driven scrutiny; neither of them have careers comparable to those held by the Obergefell plaintiffs that Godsoe had termed “eminently respectable.”158  During the case, only one of the two, Mullins, had professional employment, but only as an office manager at a real estate firm.159  Craig, meanwhile, was not employed despite his interior design training; during the years of litigation he had stalled in launching his career.160  Also, to further deviate from perceived respectability, Mullins, aside from his day-job as an office manager, admitted to harboring literary ambitions as a poet.161  The couple neither embodied the more stable, upper-middle class professional template that Godsoe had identified with the Obergefell plaintiffs or, to extend comparisons further back to Windsor, possessed the wealth or elite educations that Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer had.162  Of course, Craig and Mullins could be millionaires in private.  But on the surface, their professional and class identities vastly deviated from the upper middle-class image of prior marriage equality plaintiffs.                                                  157 See Godsoe, supra n. __, at 145-52. 158 Id. at 146 159 Allison Sherry, After the Masterpiece Ruling, David Mullins and Charlie Craig Hope to Move On, COLO.

Culturally, Craig and Mullins also did not embody “all-American” identities, nor project themselves as “Leave It to Beaver”-types either—borrowing Godsoe’s phraseology.  Neither seemed to have served in the military and thus would lack the easy connotation that service could graft to create a conventional sense of patriotism.163  Additionally, in their physical appearances, Craig and Mullins did not exhibit the “gendered” norms of hetero-masculinity typical of a “Leave It to Beaver,” traditionally all-American world.   Various media photographs of the couple during their litigation depicted them adhering less to a “straightacting,” hetero-masculine script.  Indeed, they often played with gender expectations with their physical choices in clothing, hairstyle, and jewelry. For instance, on the day of the Supreme Court arguments, both Mullins and Craig stood outside the Supreme Court Building in suits and ties.164  However, deviating from traditional dark suits and conservative shirt-and-tie combinations, Mullins wore a brighter navy blue suit with his shirt and patterned tie both in dark purple, while Craig wore an all purple ensemble except for his bright white tie that stood out vividly along with his stylized hair dyed in platinum lavender.165  The couple matched themselves more than their attorneys, and would have been easily noticed—deliberately so.  By stark contrast, at Obergefell oral arguments, Jim Obergefell wore a traditional black suit paired with a lighted-colored checkered shirt and tie that was trendy but more conventional.166  Beyond judicial appearances, the Masterpiece couple’s other public image                                                  163 Godsoe, supra n. __, at 146. 164 See, e.g., Lucia Graves, ‘This Happens All the Time’: Why A Gay Couple Took Their Cake Case to the Supreme Court, The Guardian (Jan. 18, 2018) https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/18/colorado-cake-shop-case-supreme-court (showing photograph of the Masterpiece couple at the Supreme Court Building). 165 Id.; see also Jeffrey Toobin, Justices Ginsburg and Kagan Ask About the Artistry of Wedding Cakes, NEW YORKER (Dec. 5, 2017), https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/justices-ginsburg-and-kagan-ask-about-the-artistry-of-wedding-cakes (showing the couple in full). 166 E.g., Michael S.

Often the couple was photographed wearing flashy, ostentatious clothing and alternative jewelry.167  Instead of keeping a stable sense of physical appearance, they varied their hair and grooming—especially Mullins who appear from one photographical moment to the next altering his hair colors and lengths, maintaining what some might deem a more “androgynous” look.168  Meanwhile, Craig often sported a sharply-trimmed beard and would seem to be the less androgynous of the two, but he also changed his hair color from time to time as well.169  Compared to traditional, unwavering notions of all-American male-ness, frequent variations in appearances would connote destabilizing “gendered” characteristics and even personality traits of instability.  In contrast to the Obergefell plaintiffs, Craig and Mullins projected an image that suggested they were not doing “exactly the same things as everyone else does.”170  Stereotypically, they seemed more diverse, and less “family-oriented.”  In other words, they appeared “alternative,” rather than “normal” or “mainstream”—even “queer” rather than “gay,” against the Obergefell template.               2.

Many of the couple’s public photos offered examples of them not shying away from affectionate gestures that could remind the public of their same-sex sexual desires or attractions.  Often they were photographed in loving poses—ranging from holding hands171 and slight, suggestive embracing172 all the way to mouth-to-mouth kissing173—even kissing on the Supreme Court Building steps.174  Their photograph in an NBC news feature in December 2017 depicted them casually but affectionately huddled together in a public setting—Mullins with his body and legs curled in a loose but upright fetal position against Craig, who was closely flanked and attentive to holding Mullins.175  Noticeably, Craig’s right hand was reaching over the bottom of Mullins’ thighs while his left hand was draped over the space between his own open legs, covering his genitals.176  Another photograph with Politico showing the couple kissing seemed to have been done with a bit of provocative intent.177  In addition to their visual displays of same-sex affection, the couple also discussed their physical affections publicly.

Although public displays of affection between opposite-sex couples are so frequent to render them commonplace, if one situated Craig and Mullins’ affectionate gestures back into the hands (and bodies) of a male same-sex couple, their gestures could have appeared so unfamiliar or unnatural to some in the mainstream that such displays seemed threatening on several levels.  First, Craig and Mullins’ public displays of affection could seem antithetical to the image of the respectable gay couple that has been built up, for instance, by the de-sexualized, assimilated impressions left by the Obergefell plaintiffs.181  Craig and Mullins’ public gestures risked reminding the world of their sexuality and hinted at the consensual intimacy behind closed doors.  In that way, their public displays of affection would have violated the tenets of gay respectability.  According to Yuvraj Joshi, “Lesbians and gays may produce performances of respectability as defensive strategies against being sexualized.  Respectability may be a means  of  stopping  their sexuality from becoming a barrier to their success and happiness or a safe  space  away  from  the  pain  and  suffering  of  homophobia.”182  In comparison to any notions of assimilation, Craig and Mullins’ public displays of affection                                                  178 Eric Shorey & David Reddish, David Mullins & Charlie Craig Stood against the “Humiliation of Being Told We Don’t Serve Your Kind,” QUEERTY (Jun. 24, 2018), https://www.queerty.com/david-mullins-charlie-craig-stood-humiliation-told-dont-serve-kind-20180624. 179 Id. 180 Compton, supra n. __. 181 Godsoe, supra n. __, at 147-48. 182 Yuvraj Joshi, Respectable Queerness, 43 COLUM.

On another level, their affection also had the potential to risk distinguishing their sex acts from those of opposite-sex couples.  The image of two men being affectionate with each other rather than the image of a man and a woman doing the same could have triggered responses that distinguished consensual same-sex intimacy from consensual acts of opposite-sex intimacy; one way to do so would be by focusing on the latter’s procreative agency.183  Such images could also distinguish by triggering stereotypical connotations of promiscuity, deviancy, and disease historically associated with negative, biased opinions of gay sex, particularly of the kind that contributed to the political marginalization of sexual minorities during the AIDS crisis.184  As a male same-sex couple rather than an opposite-sex couple, their abundant public images of affection could have alienated them from “mainstream” individuals who typically regarded same-sex affection as prurient, or just plain foreign.  Such imagery and affectionate public displays reinforced their sexuality, enhanced the danger for social distinction, and even perhaps provoked homophobic reactions.  This affect would undo the sameness arguments within gay assimilationist tactics and engender a heteronormative disapproval. 3.  Not Family-Oriented Caretakers According to Godsoe, involvement in childrearing or family caretaking was the third archetypal characteristic of gay assimilation the Obergefell plaintiffs displayed.185  By contrast, in the public revelations about their lives, the Masterpiece plaintiffs made no mentioning of childrearing or caretaking of a loved one—neither of the two seemed to have any adopted or biological children nor did they seem involved in caretaking of a family member; instead Craig and Mullins projected the image of a                                                  183 E.g., Skinner v.

In contrast to the effect that caregiving had on further “de-sexualizing” the Obergefell plaintiffs and their relationships, the lack of caregiving or childrearing here could have had the opposite effect.  It suggested that Craig and Mullins had less domesticated lives and were more easily differentiated from “respectable” or responsible gay couples who do have children and do take care of sick dependents.   They seemed more hedonistic than the Obergefell plaintiffs—less selfless with their time and resources than gay couples helping to rear society’s next generation or caring for the elderly.  Moreover, being childless and independent disqualifies them from “the reward of caregiving” that has accompanied marriage equality cases previously.188  This image had the slippery effect of making their marriage seem less dignified and less worthy of recognition.                  4.  Not Accidental Activists Lastly, although Craig and Mullins have claimed that they were—as the Obergefell plaintiffs had been—“accidental activists,”189 they seemed inconsistent in during interviews about just how “accidental” they were.  First, they contradicted their own claims that they had no prior interest in LGBTQ activism.  During interviews, they mentioned that they both “actually tried to avoid politics when they decided to get married”190 and they “were never activists in the gay rights movement.”191  That seemed more true for Mullins, who claimed he “considered himself apolitical until the day he and Craig were turned away at                                                  186 VH-1, Red Carpet Fashion, Picture 21, VH-1.com (Jun. 21, 2018) http://www.vh1.com/photos/0wr209/2018-trailblazer-honors-red-carpet. 187 Godsoe, supra n. __, at 149-50. 188 Id. at 150. 189 Id. at 150-52. 190 Sherry, After the Masterpiece Ruling, supra n. __.  191 Id. 34         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

Masterpiece Cakeshop.”192  But in another interview, Craig revealed he did harbor some prior activist experiences:  “Craig, an alumnus of University of Wyoming in Laramie, said 15 years ago he was a board member of a student LGBT group that sought to raise awareness for the Matthew Shepard Foundation and HIV testing.”193  In fact, Craig seemed to harbor latent motives for activism because early experiences of being ostracized for his sexuality were “hardships” that eventually “pushed him to fight for himself on the cake case.”194  Secondly, the act of pursuing a case of sexual orientation discrimination against Phillips and the bakery intrinsically seemed like a deliberate gesture of activism.  After suffering from the humiliation of Phillips’ refusal, the couple first took their story online to Facebook, “which quickly went viral worldwide in a couple of days.”195  Of course, the couple could have decided to forget the incident with Phillips and ordered their wedding cake from another bakery.  Taking their story to social media, instead, could have been read as attention-seeking.  The Facebook posting led Mullins and Craig to the discovery that Colorado public accommodations law afforded them recourse.196  They got their wedding cake from another bakery.197  And then Lambda Legal and the ACLU became involved in their case.198 According to Mullins, “[e]ventually, someone at the ACLU found us and we spoke to them, and we decided to move forward to the complaint. . . . They sort of helped us file the paperwork a little bit, and then after that and much discussion on their part, they decided to take up the case.”199   During their Supreme Court litigation, the couple participated very publicly. Until the decision was rendered, they had given over three hundred interviews, including interviews                                                  192 Id. 193 Chris Johnson, Meet the Gay Couple at the Center of Masterpiece Cakeshop Case, WASH.

Texas, both Craig and Mullins appeared at the oral arguments at the Supreme Court.202  While in Washington, D.C. to attend the arguments, they made speeches at several rallies203 and felt that “it’s important for people to see us just for the fact of we’re standing up for ourselves.”204  It was by chance that Craig and Mullins had experienced discrimination at the Masterpiece Cakeshop; they had not expected Phillips to refuse them based on his religious beliefs.205  Some of the facts of the case had accidental elements.  Yet, the couple’s subsequent reactions—taking their story to social media and speaking to major advocacy groups—suggested decisiveness in seeking action and recourse.  When pressed in one interview about the state of the LGBTQ community beyond their own lawsuit, Mullins remarked with a keen sense of political acumen:   The three changes I see happening that most inspire me are the aggressive dismantling of the gender binary, the embrace of intersectionality, and the push to make sure that marginalized voices, the voices of transgender individuals, of non-white people, of women, are not silenced or filtered through the experiences of their cisgender, white male counterparts.206 With less detail, but sharing a similar political tone, Craig responded to the same question with his analysis about gay visibility:                                                    200 Id.; Sherry, After the Masterpiece Ruling, supra n. __; Compton, supra n. __.  201 Evan Real, Gay Couple Behind Supreme Court Wedding Cake Case to Receive VH1 Trailblazer Honor, THE HOLLYWOOD REP.

Now, that we are becoming more accepted by the public in general, I see more people embracing their individuality, and showing that our differences are what make our culture unique. Pride month gives the necessary visibility to our shared humanity.207 These seemingly-liberationist remarks reflected their admission after the Supreme Court decision was rendered that “they are lifetime activists now.”208  At that point, they could not claim to be reluctant or “accidental.”  In the reverse, they created an image of willingness to challenge an instance of sexual orientation discrimination against them personally and pursue it as part of a comprehensive political impetus for change.  For them, the personal had become political.        B.  THREATENING THE STATUS QUO  It is difficult to envision sameness arguments when we place Craig and Mullins’ destabilizing sexualities within the context of queerness.  The notion of “queerness” itself evades a concrete and stable definition,209 and it is indeed theoretically less constant than the terms “gay and lesbian”—which in recent decades, have taken on more mainstream adoptions.210  Unlike “gay and lesbian,” the terminology “queer” does not merely describe sexual practices or demarcate certain traits, features, or conventions of same-sex lifestyles or practices; instead, whatever features that embodies “queerness” defy such identity-oriented classifications and exist as a means for “a destabilization of heterosexual hegemony.”211  Applying queerness to Craig and                                                  207 Id. 208 Sherry, After the Masterpiece Ruling, supra n. __. 209 Llewellyn Joseph Gibbons, Semiotics of the Scandalous and the Immoral and the Disparaging: Section 2(a) Trademark Law After Lawrence v.

Mullins’ public personas, this observation would affirm and explain how their sexualities appeared more destabilizing than the Obergefell plaintiffs for the Masterpiece Court.  They lacked the perceived socio-economic respectability of assimilated gay Americans.  They flaunted their sexuality in public.  They played with androgyny and avoided wearing conventional clothing to court appearances.  They were more deliberate as activists.  They dodged family-oriented responsibilities of childcare or caretaking.  In essence, they affirmatively challenged the assimilated image of normalcy the Obergefell plaintiffs had embodied and curtailed any sameness arguments to be made for successfully increasing the levels of respectability and interest convergence.  Craig and Mullins did not “cover” their identities, but in fact they offered a representation of sexual minorities with features that perhaps distanced themselves too far away from mainstream dominant culture itself and its “reverse cover” expectations of “stable” gay and lesbian identities.212  As perceived, they are “less gay,” but could be quite “more queer.”  Consequently, major aspects of their public personas—their lifestyle, images, dress, personalities, political motivations, perceived dissociation from family values, occupations, and the like—destabilized both heteronormative associations of sexuality and connotations from mainstream gay assimilated culture as well.  It is quite possible that disruption could be taken as a threat to the heteronormative status quo. Indeed, the sense of threat could have provoked the Court’s less sympathetic reaction in Masterpiece. The destabilizing extent and perceived threat to the status quo engendered by Craig and Mullin’s queerness becomes more evident when considered within Justice Anthony Kennedy’s majority opinion in Masterpiece.  In both the state commission and Court of Appeal reviews, the couple obtained successful showings that Phillips’ refusal had amounted to sexual orientation discrimination under CADA.213  Nevertheless, without appearing assimilated, Craig and Mullins were unable to avail themselves to Kennedy’s dignity jurisprudence to the extent that marriage equality plaintiffs in Obergefell and Windsor previously had.  In Obergefell, assimilation had played well into Kennedy’s                                                  212 Yoshino, supra n. __. 213 Masterpiece, 138 S.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. dignity jurisprudence and eventually allowed the Court to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples.214  However, the manner in which Kennedy defined dignity in Obergefell revealed that he subscribed to a version of dignity that mandated respectability rather than a version premised on an individual’s inherent worth and respect.215  Within that paradigm, assimilated characteristics that illustrated how same-sex couples were invariably similar to opposite-sex couples permitted a comparison of respectability to be drawn where same-sex couples could seem just as respectable and as dignified as opposite-sex couples.216  From there, same-sex couples’ interest to have their relationships legally recognized as marriages were heightened and aligned with the establishment’s interest to preserve and protect the primacy of marriage.  As Kennedy wrote in Obergefell, plaintiffs there had sought the right to marry, “not to denigrate marriage but rather to live their lives, or honor their spouses’ memory, joined by its bond.”217  In addition, by referring to how past historical changes to marriage, such as the abandonment of coverture, have “strengthened, not weakened, the institution of marriage,” Kennedy suggested in Obergefell that extending the right to marry to same-sex couples would do the same.218  Thus, by relying on features of assimilation and respectability to sufficiently dignify same-sex couples in Obergefell, the legal interests of the plaintiffs there aligned with mainstream interests to preserve marriage’s institutional and social primacy.  In this way, Kennedy’s dignity jurisprudence in Obergefell became a vehicle that facilitated the interest convergence that eventually resulted in marriage equality.  On the contrary, in Masterpiece, Craig and Mullins’ lack of comparable assimilated traits offered fewer opportunities for leveraging respectability within Kennedy’s dignity paradigm.  In terms of setting up the case inquiry that eventually revealed a denial of interest convergence for the Masterpiece couple, Kennedy begins at the outset of his decision by immediately                                                  214 Chang, supra n. __, at 6. 215 Joshi, Respectable Dignity, supra n. __, at 119. 216 Chang, supra note __, at 6. 217 135 S.

Even before presenting the issues, Kennedy attempts to insinuate that what Craig and Mullins had requested from Phillips was somewhat illegitimate and as a result portrayed the couple in an undignified light.  Beyond reciting that Phillips had denied Craig and Mullins’ request for a custom wedding cake because of his religious views against same-sex marriages, Kennedy noted separately that Colorado had not recognized same-sex marriages at the time.219  This observation takes attention off Craig and Mullins’ sexual identities, which CADA protects, and suggests illicit conduct that would invariably bolster or support Phillips’ discriminatory refusal; after all, Craig and Mullins had been legally married in Massachusetts and were not officially seeking to be recognized as a married couple in Colorado at the time.220  The cake was merely to celebrate that occasion.221  This slight reference that Colorado was not a marriage equality state at the time the couple ordered the cake from Phillips does not reflect their intentions; instead it misconstrues the facts and poses the dubious effect of insinuating that Craig and Mullins were asking for something they were not legally entitled to, and under that logic, Phillips would have been complicit had he agreed to their cake request.  In reality, Craig and Mullins was only asking Phillips to create a wedding cake to celebrate their legally-obtained, out-of-state marriage.  Again, they were not seeking Colorado’s recognition of their out-of-state marriage.  Kennedy’s factual mischaracterization is one step in denying Craig and Mullins dignifying potential.  After all, it would seem hard to dignify—or even sympathize with—individuals who were refused for seeking something that was illegal.               Another step toward denying dignifying potential is in Kennedy’s lack of acknowledgment of the Craig and Mullins’ personal characteristics compared to the way he had handled the personal facts of prominent Obergefell plaintiffs.  Obergefell had instances where Kennedy singled out assimilated traits of the litigants in order to show that denying marriage rights was                                                  219 138 S.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. discriminatory and demeaning.222  Specifically, Kennedy had depicted the personal stigma and harm of Jim Obergefell’s erasure from his deceased husband’s death certificate, despite having cared extensively for his dying husband; how marriage discrimination threatened the family life of April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, a lesbian couple who were nurses and fostered several children; and how Ijpe DeKoe, a diligent and honorable member of the Army Reserve, was demeaned when his marriage to Thomas Kostura was not recognized in their home state.223  All of this was done in close-up, dramatic effect. By contrast, throughout his Masterpiece opinion, Kennedy only mentions Craig and Mullins minimally, and when he does, it is transactional either to recite procedure224 or mere relevant facts.225  Such brief passages are devoid of any significant personalizing characteristics.  Kennedy refuses to explore just how being denied a wedding cake as a same-sex couple demeaned the couple’s human dignities.  There were no extrapolations of indignity—no dramatizations involving medical transport planes or missing names on death certificates.226  Instead, the only passages that bring up the possibility that sexual orientation discrimination can result in violating human dignity or stigma are in two brief sections when Kennedy postulates about gay couples and individuals in the abstract.227  To Kennedy, it seems quite possible that gay people can be demeaned in the marketplace if denied goods and services.228  But he never applies such abstractions to Craig and Mullins’ sexual orientation discrimination claim.  Again, motivating this silent denial might be the lack of sameness and respectability in Craig and Mullins’ identities, compared to litigants in the prior gay rights cases—particularly in the marriage context.  Consequently, Kennedy’s rhetorical techniques for dignifying individuals—and with that, his entire dignity jurisprudence—evades Craig and Mullins.  This result stands even when their CADA claim for sexual orientation                                                  222 E.g., Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2594-95. 223 Id. 224 Masterpiece, 138 S.

The incongruity is possible likely because at the Supreme Court level the couple did not exhibit the “stable,” gay assimilated characteristics that would have otherwise availed them access to Kennedy’s respectability line of dignity jurisprudence.  They just did not garner the type of dignity for the Court to fully sympathize with their pursuit of formal equality.  Rather than being just “gay enough” to succeed, Craig and Mullins’ queerness seemed to have broken the boundaries that lie at the core of what assimilationist strategies have done to essentialize the gay identity.  The destabilizing effect of their queer sexualities undoubtedly clashed with the assimilationist images of litigants in the marriage equality cases and probably exceeded the Court’s tolerance of gay identities as well.  As a result, Craig and Mullins’ public personas perhaps deviated too far from expected notions of gayness, cultivated from both mainstream and gay assimilated angles—ideas which have stable connotations that support the image of respectability.  Quite possibly, this deviation, as the following will discuss, contributed to the Court’s reluctance to affirm their sexual orientation discrimination claim because they might have seemed too far from assimilated and too “queer” to connote the requisite sameness and dignifying respectability.   Instead, this incongruity was likely a threat to the status quo. C.  PRESERVING THE STATUS QUO Failing to satisfy each of Godsoe’s underscored characteristics of assimilation likely prevented Craig and Mullins from manifesting the version of gay assimilation and respectability propagated in the marriage cases.  Consequently, the couple could not avail themselves as readily to the sameness arguments that the Obergefell plaintiffs used in making their collective case for marriage equality.  They would have failed to appear “normal.”  In fact, they would have threatened the idea of “normal.”  Such distinctions afforded the Court opportunity to reinforce its interest to preserve the status quo against any interest to protect the couple’s queerness.       1.  Reframing the Issues  42         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. To add to Kennedy’s refusal to dignify Craig and Mullins’ queerness in the way he had dignified the gay assimilated plaintiffs in the marriage cases, Kennedy also reframes the legal issues from how the claims had been discussed below.  The Colorado Court of Appeals had observed that the dispute involved both Craig and Mullins’ rights under CADA and Phillips’ claim that his speech and religious expression rights were violated, but then very quickly dismissed Phillips’ claim.229  Kennedy, on the other hand, begins his majority opinion by questioning the weight of Colorado’s public accommodations law and its respect for sexual minorities against a status quo that finds religious intolerance compelling.230  Then he articulates the issues as a struggle between of the level of protection for the “rights and dignity of gay persons who are or wish to be, married but who face discrimination when they seek goods or services”231 and “the right of all persons to exercise fundamental freedoms under the First Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.”232  From here, it becomes even clearer that the decision will weigh these competing interests, framed in this way.  In recapitulating the issues thusly, Kennedy also legitimizes and raises the interest in protecting Phillips’ free speech and religious exercise contentions.  Indeed, he is focusing on the interest to preserve the status quo.  First, he observes sympathetically that Phillips’ free speech claim is “an instructive example, however, of the position that the application of constitutional freedoms in new contexts can deepen our understanding of their meaning.”233  Similarly, Kennedy finds that “[t]he same difficulties arise in determining whether a baker has a valid free exercise claim.”234  He alludes to potentially validating Phillips’ actions.  In essence, the effort to which Kennedy explains why Phillips’ free speech and religious exercise claims might pose difficulty in this case begins to establish what will be a plausible deniability that perhaps Phillips’ refusal could                                                  229 See e.g., Craig v.

By juxtaposing of the issues and amplifying Phillip’s free speech and religious exercise claims, Kennedy hints at his potential deference to the status quo—one that is discriminatory.  After all, despite marriage equality victories and the increasing positive image of sexual minorities in mainstream culture in the handful of years since Lawrence, the status quo has continued to recognize dominant religious views and sentiments—some that invariably have led to severe inequalities and legal detriments for sexual minorities and other marginalized people.  Nevertheless, such views have received constitutional protection.  For instance, in the face of legal and political advances for sexual minorities, many states have enacted religious freedom acts.235  In the same vein, after Obergefell, some states have relied on religion to motivate and legitimize bills that restrict restroom use for transgender people.236  And even the Supreme Court has recently prioritized religion over some aspects of women’s reproductive rights.237  As for anti-discrimination laws, many states, unlike Colorado, currently do not have legislation that protects sexual minorities,238 and the same can be echoed for the federal government.239  Whatever federal protections against discrimination that sexual minorities have received are limited in scope and have come by piecemeal through various federal agencies or governmental branches.240  In essence, a discriminatory status quo that is partly validated and perpetuated by religious freedom has received heightened legal                                                  235 Findlaw, Religious Freedom Acts by State, Findlaw.org   https://civilrights.findlaw.com/discrimination/religious-freedom-acts-by-state.html. 236 Tom Dart, Transgender 'Bathroom Bill' Leaves Texas Christians Deeply Divided, THE GUARDIAN (Aug. 6, 2017) https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/06/transgender-bathroom-bill-texas-christians-lgbt-rights. 237 Burwell v.

Weighing the Preservation Interest of the Status Quo Of course, Craig and Mullins do not exhibit sufficient dignity to match the interest to protect religious discrimination.  In their initial respondents’ brief, Craig and Mullins used dignity to leverage interests.241  At the same time, Phillips also contested the couple’s dignitary interests.242  Thus, before arguments, the parties were already trying to access Kennedy’s dignity jurisprudence.  However, Craig and Mullins’ use of dignity seemed less heightened compared to the use of dignity by the Obergefell plaintiffs, which was much more direct in regards to relying on interest convergence and had observed dignity within contexts such as parenting and the discriminatory status quo.243  Perhaps this less overt reliance on dignity and interest convergence was so because the Masterpiece couple had already prevailed against Phillips twice and technically had the law on their side.  After all, CADA did expressly protect against sexual orientation discrimination. And cases such as Lawrence, Windsor, and Obergefell all showed that the Court could favor same-sex couples.  Yet, the couple’s inability to play into the “respectable dignity” that accessed Kennedy’s gay rights jurisprudence ends up hurting their interests.244  Their inability to seem respectable because of their queerness affected the chances that their interests would substantively align with the Court’s interests to affirm the status quo.  In fact, their queerness challenged and threatened the status quo precisely through that inability to seem respectable under establishment norms.  Accordingly, the focus of the opinion was heavily on Phillips’ religious freedom—and by extension reinforcing the discriminatory status quo—even when Phillips did not fit within any religious protections under CADA.  After all, the bakery was not a place “principally used for religious purposes” exempted by CADA.245  Therefore, technically                                                  241 E.g., Brief for Respondents, supra n. __, at 41, 43. 242 Brief for Petitioner, supra n. __, at 25, 54-61. 243 Compare Brief for Respondents, supra n. __, with Brief for Petitioners at 19-23, 31-32, Obergefell v.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. the couple’s discrimination claim had more validity under CADA than Phillips’ religious defenses.             Particularly in Section II of his Masterpiece opinion, Kennedy underscores the primacy of protecting anti-gay religious sentiments, despite no available CADA exception for Phillips.  Kennedy accomplishes this underscoring in part by articulating how Craig and Mullins came up short in their dignified respectability.  As he states, “[o]ur society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth.”246  At first, Kennedy seems consonant with his recognition of same-sex couples in Obergefell.  By itself, the statement seems absolute in terms of protecting sexual minorities.  However, Kennedy immediately qualifies his declaration by writing, “For that reason the laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the exercise of their civil rights.  The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts.”247  By inserting how the Constitution “can, and in some instances must” provide sexual minorities civil rights protections, he suggests subtly that negotiation exists at setting the level of interest in which protections of civil rights based on sexual orientation are given—that there must be situations in which the Constitution has less interest in affording civil rights protections of sexual minorities even if their freedoms “on terms equal to others” are subject to “great weight and respect by the courts.”248  Other commentators have read this passage in Section II of Masterpiece Cakeshop with greater optimism because just on these three sentences alone one could read a friendly ambiguity in favor of sexual minorities into Kennedy’s statement.249  Such a reading, however, would ignored the series of further qualifications that follow in which Kennedy raises the importance of preserving religious views against same-sex marriages:  “At the same time, the religious and philosophical                                                  246 Masterpiece, 138 S.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression.”250  Here is where Kennedy repeats the disparity of interest levels.  Like the protection of the civil rights of sexual minorities, such religious views against marriage equality are not absolute either.  In the commercial context, these views are subject to public accommodation laws and would not survive so long as such laws are general and neutrally applicable.251  But he does not actually critique how CADA itself is not general and neutrally applicable.  There is no direct attack premised on the opinion that Phillips’ bakery ought to have been exempt.  He is just weighing the interests.   Constitutionally, despite public accommodations legislation, he notes that the law could not compel members of a religious clergy to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies if doing so clashed with the free exercise of religion.252  In fact, such protections of a clergy member’s refusal, based on freedom of religious exercise, to officiate a same-sex wedding ceremony is so sufficiently “well understood in our constitutional order as an exercise of religion” that Kennedy supposes sexual minorities could subordinate their rights in the face of such refusal—as “an exercise that gay persons could recognize and accept without serious diminishment to their own dignity and worth.”253  Such an overly-presumptuous observation patronizes and ignores the indignities that sexual minorities have suffered at the hands of religious exclusion. Yet again, the disparity of interest levels exists and is demonstrated by how Kennedy subordinates the interest of protecting sexual minorities beneath the interest for religious protections.  The passage potentially condones certain acts of religious animus against sexual minorities, placing exercise of religion over the protection of non-heteronormative sexual identities.  This priority exists even despite Kennedy’s observation of that protection for free exercise of religion must be “confined”;254 otherwise, a mass commercial refusal to provide                                                  250 138 S.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. goods and services to sexual minorities might lead to “a community-wide stigma inconsistent with the history and dynamics of civil rights laws that ensure equal access to goods, services, and public accommodations.”255  But it also shows that there is enough room for Phillips to have validly refused Craig and Mullins.  In terms of dignity, this discussion implies a hierarchical limitation; sexual minorities deserve some constitutional protection based on their dignity, but not enough to surpass some instances of free religious exercise. This hierarchy resembles the Court’s prior reluctance to raise the lower-level scrutiny analysis of sexual minorities—even in cases featuring assimilated plaintiffs—such as in Windsor and reveals how the Court actually views sexual orientation as a protectable trait below other protectable identity traits.  Kennedy seems to signal that the Masterpiece couple could not confidently use their CADA sexual orientation discrimination claim to breakthrough to a fuller or higher treatment of formal equality for civil rights protections of sexual minorities in this federal forum.  Even when Phillips and his bakery clearly did not fall within the CADA religion exemption, his religious exercise rights conflict and ought to be noted substantially enough as if he deserved exemption.    We see how Kennedy regards Phillips’ rights when he directly examines Phillips’ claim.  In examining Phillips’ account, Kennedy sides with Phillips on his distinction that creating a custom-ordered cake for Craig and Mullins would have used “his artistic skill to make an expressive statement, a wedding endorsement in [Phillips’] own voice and of his own creation.”256  Here, Kennedy entwines both Phillips’ free speech and religious justifications for refusing Craig and Mullins and finds that “Phillips’ dilemma was particularly understandable given the background and legal principles and administration of the law in Colorado at that time” since Colorado had not yet recognized same-sex marriages when Phillips’ refusal occurred.257  In fact, Kennedy finds that                                                   255 Id. 256 Id. at 1728.  257 Id. 48         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. there is some force to the argument that the baker was not unreasonable in deeming it lawful to decline to take an action that he understood to be an expression of support for their validity when that expression was contrary to his sincerely held religious beliefs, at least insofar as his refusal was limited to refusing to create and express a message in support of gay marriage, even one planned to take place in another State.258 Kennedy seems to suggest that had Phillips reluctantly agreed to create a cake for Craig and Mullins, this act would have severely violated a term so personal to Phillips because of his religious beliefs that the government would need to take notice.   He notes the three William Jack cake cases in which the Colorado Civil Rights Division found it was lawful for three bakers to have separately refused creating cakes that bore messages demeaning sexual minorities or same-sex marriages259 and noted that “[a]t the time, state law also afforded storekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages the storekeeper considered offensive.”260  All of his ruminations about the protections of sexual minorities and exercise of religious freedom culminates in qualifications that appear as if Kennedy is heavily posturing to preserve what results in the bottom line regarding Phillips’ actions—that ultimately despite the dignity and worth the Court has previously given to sexual minorities in the marriage equality cases, and despite how Phillips is not exempted from CADA here, formal equality for sexual minorities must give way to religious freedom.  Essentially the interest to protect sexual orientation from discrimination is not on equal footing as interest in protecting free exercise of religion.  Categorical denial of services and goods to sexual minorities based on a provider’s religious beliefs would not be condoned, of course; however, as Kennedy recognized, “Phillips was entitled to the neutral and respectful consideration of his claims in all the circumstances of the case.”261  On Phillips’ behalf, Kennedy reaches extensively to comprehend                                                  258 Id. 259 Id. 260 Id. 261 Id. at 1729. 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    49   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

Phillips’ moral and religious dilemma, reading the case narrowly at the expense of diminishing the dignity and worth of Craig and Mullins.  Overall, Kennedy essentially embeds a plausible deniability favoring Phillips’ actions over the dignity of Craig and Mullins’ sexual identities.  Thus, he heavily prioritizes the interest to preserve the discriminatory status quo in order to curb the threat against it.   3.  Religious Hostility        In truth, the tension between sexual orientation antidiscrimination versus religious freedom that Kennedy raises, explores, and then seemingly weighs in favor of Phillips never comes to an actual determination on the merits.  Kennedy never proclaims the actual doctrinal dividing line between Phillips’ religious objections to same-sex marriage and the protections of Craig and Mullins’ sexual identities from discrimination.  He never overrules CADA.  So his prioritization of interests to preserve the status quo is never given binding effect.  Within the factual contours of Masterpiece, Kennedy merely suggests that the interest to preserve the status quo outweighs the interest to protect Craig and Mullins’ sexual orientation from discrimination.  On the substantive legal merits of Craig and Mullins’ discrimination claim, the formal equality aspects would reach a favorable outcome for the couple.  CADA had stood on the couple’s side.  Even Kennedy admits that CADA expressly forbid sexual orientation discrimination in the realm public accommodations.262  Despite this, Kennedy effectuates preservation interest by examining the case procedurally to reverse the Court of Appeals.  He reviews the public hearings on the matter by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and reads into the record religious hostility displayed by members of the Commission sufficient for him to violate religious neutrality.263  Specifically, Kennedy focuses on remarks that disparage personal religious beliefs:   At several points during its meeting, commissioners endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or                                                  262 Id. at 1725. 263 Id. at 1729. 50         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. commercial domain, implying that religious beliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado’s business community.  One commissioner suggested that Phillips can believe “what he wants to believe,” but cannot act on his religious beliefs “if he decides to do business in the state.” . . . A few moments later, the commissioner restated the position: “[I]f a businessman wants to do business in the state and he’s got an issue with the—the law’s impacting his personal belief system, he needs to look at being able to comprise.”264    Although Kennedy admits that such statements could be construed differently, he finds such comments are “more likely” hostile toward Phillips.265  He is convinced of observing more religious hostility made at a later Commission public hearing that furthered the animosity toward Phillips’ religious views.266  Kennedy heavy-handedly compounds the Commission’s previous statements he excerpted with a particular Commission member’s individual quote criticizing societal uses of religion for advancing discriminatory ends throughout human history—for instance, justifying slavery or the Holocaust.267  That Commission member’s quote had ended on a personal tone, which Kennedy expressly interprets as a disparagement that effectuated the Commission’s alleged hostility to Phillips—that calling his religious views “despicable” and contextualizing them as rhetoric for advancing discrimination belittled and dehumanized such views and actions.268  Although Kennedy does not expressly use “dignity” rhetoric here in these passages, he employs these remote excerpts from the Commission’s extensive hearings and review to draw conclusions that such remarks about Phillips’ religious views and acts ultimately demeaned Phillips.  All in all, Kennedy surmises that the Commission’s remarks had suggested “that religious beliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado’s business community”; could be seen as “inappropriate                                                  264 Id.  265 Id. 266 Id.  267 Id.  268 Id. 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    51   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

Kennedy’s repeated characterizations of Phillips’ religious motivations as “sincere” imply that Phillips was being genuine and truthful about his religious beliefs. It also suggests that Phillips’ actions against Craig and Mullins were somehow blameless—that his refusal was somehow naturally justified because they were backed by “sincere” religious beliefs against same-sex marriages and that Phillips could not help himself from acting inconsistently with his beliefs.  As such, Kennedy again views Phillips’ religiously-motived actions of sexual orientation discrimination with a plausible deniability in favor of Phillips.  Because Phillips’ religiously-motived actions are backed by “sincere” religious beliefs, the Commission’s public remarks on record about Phillips’ exercise of religion—and the lack of objections to these remarks at the hearings and in later appellate review271—would always be taken as hostile, inappropriate, and disparaging to Phillips’ personal character.  In this way, Kennedy moralizes and nearly essentializes Phillips’ religious identity.  He dignifies Phillips.  This reasoning pantomimes the kind of dignity rhetoric Kennedy had used in Lawrence, Windsor, and Obergefell to show respectively how anti-sodomy laws, DOMA, and exclusion to marriage all demeaned the identities of same-sex couples. He ushers in such indication because the type of religious freedom Phillips subscribes to, after all, is within the dominant status quo.  To Kennedy, the dignity in Phillips’ religious identity unquestionably exists, and so it must be that his beliefs are “sincere.”   This sense that Kennedy is not merely defending Phillips’ religious views, but Phillips’ dignity is even furthered by his                                                  269 Id. 270 Id. 271 Id. 1729-30. 52         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

In essence, by making that cake for Craig and Mullins, he would be endorsing something that he did not believe in—so much so that he could not even go along with it without it becoming personal.  Again, therein lies the hostility, according to Kennedy.277  One could argue that Kennedy was not merely defending Phillips’ sincerely-held religious beliefs here but also defending Phillips’ religious identity.                                                     272 Id. at 1730. 273 Id.  274 Id. 275 Id. 276 Id. at 1730-31. 277 Id. at 1731. 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    53   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

Speciousness and Questions of Motives Kennedy’s religious hostility findings against Phillips become specious and thin when his version of the Commission’s lack of neutrality competes with the versions expounded in his colleagues’ concurrences and dissents.  Whether the other Justices have found lesser, deeper, or no violations of religious neutrality, disagreement exists over both the Commission’s remarks toward Phillips’ religiously-motivated refusal and the handling of the William Jack cake cases below.  Such disagreement calls into question the substance of Kennedy’s religious hostility findings and illustrates the desperate attempt to preserve the status quo.   Although in agreement with the majority’s overall ruling in Masterpiece that religious hostility existed in lower proceedings, Justice Kagan, with Justice Breyer joining, offers a lesser degree of religious hostility in her concurrence.  She suggests that the Commission and the Court of Appeals’ regard for the different results between the Masterpiece case here and the three other Colorado cake cases was legally justified and not a sign of religious hostility.278  In her view, the different regard between those cake refusals and Phillips’ hinged on factual interpretation:  “[I]n refusing that request, the bakers did not single out Jack because of his religion, but instead treated him the same way they would have treated anyone else—just as CADA requires.  By contrast, the same-sex couple in this case requested a wedding cake that Phillips would have made for an opposite-sex couple.”279  Such refusal violated CADA’s public accommodations protections against sexual orientation discrimination.280  In that way, “[t]he different outcomes in the Jack cases and the Phillips case could thus have been justified by a plain reading and neutral application of Colorado law—untainted by any bias against a religious belief.”281  Kagan only agrees with Kennedy’s majority that the views and sentiments of the Commission members at the public hearings were religiously hostile, and thus, her version of                                                  278 Id. at 1733-34 (Kagan & Breyer, JJ., concurring). 279 Id. at 1733. 280 Id. 281 Id.  54         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. religious hostility—though it exists enough in this case for her to join in the Court’s reversal—seems less severe.        Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Alito, concurs by re-examining on his own terms the Commission’s treatment of the other Colorado bakers’ refusals in those three cake cases and Phillips.’  While Kagan had rendered that the cake that Craig and Mullins had requested from Phillips was a wedding cake, Gorsuch interprets that what Craig and Mullins had asked for was “a cake celebrating a same-sex wedding.”282  This interpretation allows Gorsuch to read the fact patterns of the William Jack cake cases and Masterpiece similarly and question the Commission’s and Court of Appeals’ distinguishing of those cases from Phillips.’  If the bakers were legally allowed to refuse Mr. Jack’s requests for cakes that denigrated same-sex weddings because the messages were morally offensive to the bakers, then Phillips should have been able to refuse Craig and Mullins’ request for a cake celebrating a same-sex wedding because same-sex marriages was religiously repugnant to Phillips.283  As he sees it, “[i]n both cases, it was the kind of cake, not the kind of customer, that mattered to the bakers”284 and that “[t]he problem here is that the Commission failed to act neutrally by applying a consistent legal rule.”285  Gorsuch heightens that disparity with deeper analysis than Kennedy does.  But to see the cake as one that particularly celebrates a same-sex wedding or marriage resembles the “special rights” rhetoric that conservative opponents had lodged against gay rights movement initiatives in the past.  In this way, Gorsuch’s deeper analysis engenders more animosity toward the couple than Kennedy’s.    Likewise, Justice Thomas’ concurrence, joined by Gorsuch, also seemed to deepen the religious hostility findings.  Unlike Gorsuch or Kagan, his concurrence focused exclusively on the free speech claim that Kennedy had left unexplored in the majority opinion.286  Because Phillips refused Craig and Mullins on the                                                  282 Id. at 1735 (Gorsuch & Alito, JJ., concurring). 283 Id. at 1735-36. 284 Id. at 1736. 285 Id.  286 Id. at 1740 (Thomas & Gorsuch, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    55   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. grounds that he was religiously opposed to same-sex marriage, his act of refusal, which Thomas analyzes as speech, is invariably entwined with religion.  First, Thomas finds that for Phillips the design and creation of custom wedding cakes is expressive enough to qualify as speech.287  In addition, Thomas finds that wedding cakes themselves are highly symbolic, which further heightens the expressiveness of creating them.288  Thus, the act of creating wedding cakes for Phillips is an expressive one for speech protection.289  As such, Thomas regards Craig and Mullins’ request as one that asked Phillips to create a cake for a same-sex wedding and sought endorsement with the couple’s speech—not his.290  Thomas’ rationale here amplifies Phillips’ personal endorsement when he creates a wedding cake—“Colorado is requiring Phillips to be ‘intimately connected’ with the couple’s speech”—and thus his First Amendment speech protections arise.291  Such speech would be antithetical to Phillips’ religious identity, and Thomas demonstrates this by drawing out Phillips’ religious nature.292  To add to this free speech violation to Kennedy’s analysis deepens the findings of religious hostility in the majority opinion.         In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sotomayor, completely disagrees with her colleagues’ finding of religious hostility and she would have affirmed the ruling below that Phillips’ refusal amounted to sexual orientation discrimination against Craig and Mullins.293 She contests the majority’s finding of religious hostility.294  First, she sides with Kagan’s view that the Masterpiece cake was a wedding cake and not a cake that had special meaning attributed to the baker.295  Predictably, this take on the cake leads to the finding that Kagan had asserted in comparing and ultimately contrasting Phillips’ refusal with the refusal of other Colorado bakers for requests to                                                  287 Id. at 1742. 288 Id. at 1743. 289 Id. 290 Id. at n. 3. 291 Id. at 1743 n. 3. 292 Id. at 1745. 293 Id. at 1752 (Ginsburg & Sotomayor, JJ., dissenting). 294 See id. at 1748-49. 295 Id. at 1748 n. 1. 56         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

In Ginsburg’s opinion, she argues against Gorsuch’s view that the case is about the kind of cake and not the identity of the parties.  Rather, “[w]hat matters is that Phillips would not provide a good or service to a same-sex couple that he would provide to a heterosexual couple.”297  This reading reveals her perspective that the cake was a wedding cake and not a cake with a pro-marriage equality message:  “When a couple contacts a bakery for a wedding cake, the product they are seeking is a cake celebrating their wedding—not a cake celebrating heterosexual weddings or same-sex weddings—and that is the service Craig and Mullins were denied.”298  The reason for that denial, as Ginsburg surmises, is Craig and Mullins’ sexual orientation.299    Ginsburg also firmly contradicts Kennedy’s other reason for finding religious hostility, which regarded certain Commission members’ remarks as intolerant of Phillips’ religious views.  Just as the treatment of the other Colorado cake cases with Phillips’ refusal should not have prompted a reversal based on religious hostility, “nor do the comments by one or two members of one of the four decisionmaking entities considering this case justify reversing the judgment below.”300  In her perspective, “[w]hatever one may think of the statements in historical context, I see no reason why the comments of one or two Commissioners should be taken to overcome Phillips’ refusal to see a wedding cake to Craig and Mullins.”301  To support her view here, she observed that the lower proceedings also “involved several layers of independent decisionmaking, of which the Commission was but one” and narrated four stages of rulings in Colorado before the case reached the Supreme Court.302  Such layers of adjudication make                                                  296 Id. at 1749. 297 Id. at 1750. 298 Id. 299 Id. 300 Id. at 1749. 301 Id. at 1751. 302 Id. 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    57   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

Kennedy’s findings of religious hostility questionable and hollow.303  According to Ginsburg, even the Court’s prior precedent on religious neutrality, Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, “implicated a sole decisionmaking body” and not the kind of proceedings on below in Masterpiece.304  She would have completely rendered an opposite opinion had she penned the majority ruling.    Taken altogether, the differences amongst Masterpiece’s majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions over the existence, intensity, and non-existence of religious hostility against Phillips seems to suggest that the religious hostility issue was a tenuous one to consider.  Did religious hostility exist in both the Commission member’s remarks against Phillips’ religious views and how the Commission distinguished Phillips’s refusal in Masterpiece from the bakers’ refusals in the William Jack cases, as Kennedy argues in the majority?  Or did religious hostility only exist in the remarks and not in the way Kennedy or Gorsuch read the Commission’s distinguishing of the other cake case, as Kagan writes in her concurrence?  Did it arise within the free speech violation as well, as Thomas seems to suggest?  Was the religious hostility more intense and more pernicious than Kennedy’s majority suggest, as Gorsuch tries to demonstrate in his reconciliation of the William Jack cake cases and Masterpiece?  Or did neither the remarks nor the Commissions’ distinguishing of the William Jack cake cases from Masterpiece amount to any religious hostility in the lower proceedings, as Ginsburg tries to prove?  There is no consensus, revealing that the Court’s review of general applicability in Masterpiece is thin and potentially specious.  Perhaps enough religious hostility exists or not.  It suggests the possibility that the Court’s rendering was not quite accurate, but instead it was the best argument to make in light of stronger, more definite facts that sexual orientation discrimination did occur under CADA when Phillips refused to fulfill Craig and Mullins’ request.  And that best argument—religious hostility that violates general applicability—is a contentious and debatable one, at best.  That emphatic urgency in Masterpiece to stick with such a questionable argument as the                                                  303 Id. 304 Id. at 1751-52. 58         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

Or it could exemplify the Justices’ tension with the kind of sexual minority litigants this time before the Court.  In essence, the Court seems to articulate a higher interest in preserving a discriminatory status quo over affirming an instance of sexual orientation anti-discrimination.  Sexual orientation as a protectable trait against discrimination reached some progress in Obergefell, but never at the kind of heightened scrutiny protections that race or gender has received.  And that limited progress is definitely underscored by the interests the Court anxiously engenders around religious freedom in this sexual orientation discrimination case.    The instability of the religious hostility argument amongst Justices of the Masterpiece Court, hence, raises questions of motives.  The case’s resolution through Kennedy’s majority opinion depends on the Justices’ review of the procedural aspects of the lower proceedings in order to dispense with the task of determining the couple’s sexual orientation discrimination claim under CADA.  That strategic reliance on procedure forecloses any substantive review between Craig and Mullins’ anti-discrimination interests and Phillips’ religious interests—a substantive review that could have sided in favor of the couple as the Commission and the Court of Appeals exhibited strong findings of discrimination in their CADA reviews.  Not to mention, the Court’s review of the procedures on below is directly related to Phillips’ religion—directly attached to interests in preserving a discriminatory status quo though religious freedom.  Consequently, the Court highlights the interests of the status quo preservation over protecting sexual minorities—here, sexual minorities who showed little resemblance to the assimilated sexual minorities in Obergefell.  Of course, it will be unknown, given the way the Court handled its decision to reverse Masterpiece, whether Craig and Mullins would have prevailed here had they exhibited more of the same traits that the plaintiffs from the marriage equality cases had exhibited.  However, in terms of sexual orientation, one view remains evident from 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    59   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

When confronted with religion—even in the context of marriage—queer sexual identities rather than assimilated ones engender much less deference with the Court.  In Masterpiece, the Court’s conception of sexual orientation anti-discrimination at this time very likely does not include protection of less assimilated, less mainstream sexual minorities.     Indeed, the primacy that Kennedy gives to protecting Phillips’ exercise of religion is so paramount that it makes deference to religion seem circuitous and difficult to critique.  After all, acts of discrimination are often harbored from some forms of animus.305  In pinpointing discrimination, drawing such motives help to establish that an act of discrimination occurred.  However, because Kennedy finds that even the Commission’s comparison remark about the historical use of religion to advance discrimination had tarnished Phillips’ religious identity rather than serve to constructively demonstrate religiously-motivated discrimination, future adjudicating bodies must tread very carefully when their fair and neutral application of laws are prompted in religion cases.  Such perspective on the Court’s finding of religious hostility has scholarly support.  According to Leslie Kendrick and Micah Swartzman,  [i]n Masterpiece, the Court mistook the neutral application of civil rights law for what Justice Scalia once called a “fit of spite.”  The Commission's decision to deny Phillips a religious exemption was not the product of religious hostility, but rather a good faith effort to interpret and apply CADA, which forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public accommodations.  In holding that the Commission failed to treat Phillips’s claims with neutrality and respect, the Court improperly applied free exercise doctrine to the facts of the case, finding unconstitutional hostility and intolerance where there were none.306                                                   305 E.g., Romer, 517 U.S. at 632. 306 Leslie Kendrick & Micah Schwartzman, The Etiquette of Animus, 132 HARV.

Correspondingly, the effect of Masterpiece, in regards to future application of neutrality, seems unclear according to John Inazu: \"The [Masterpiece Court’s] jurisprudence means that we’re going to have state-by-state norms that vary quite a bit . . .  about what counts as protections for religious freedom.”307  These comments and the different versions (or in Ginsburg’s case, non-version) of religious hostility render Kennedy’s finding and use of religious hostility in the majority opinion shaky.  Indirectly, it could exhibit the Court’s hasty anxiety to prioritize the interest to protect religious freedom within a discriminatory status quo over interest to promote sexual orientation anti-discrimination.  It serves as another possible sign of failure to satisfy the requisite interest convergence needed for Craig and Mullins’ success.    All of this demonstrates the heightened interest the Court gives to preserving a discriminatory status quo in Masterpiece.  Not only does Kennedy prioritize the interest toward protecting religious freedoms more heavily than the interest in protecting against sexual orientation discrimination, but he then demonstrates how paramount that interest is—in fact, he reinforces it—when he reverses the sexual orientation discrimination ruling on procedural grounds that the Colorado proceedings did not sufficiently respect Phillips’ “sincere” religious beliefs.308  At the end of the Court’s majority opinion, even despite Colorado’s interest in protecting sexual orientation discrimination as CADA articulates and despite the state’s adjudicated findings that Phillips’ refusal was sexual orientation discrimination against Craig and Mullins, this interest in preserving a discriminatory status quo stands strong and towering.  But in reaching that towering fortification, Kennedy and the concurring Justices seem to have offered an unsatisfying finding of religious hostility.  It belies a deep, pernicious sense of queer anxiety against Craig and Mullins fueled by a perception that the status quo was threatened.                                                           307 Tom Gjelten, Court Sees 'Hostility' To Religious Beliefs In Case Of Baker And Same-Sex Couple, NPR (Jun. 5, 2018) https://www.npr.org/2018/06/05/617029562/colorado-bakers-supreme-court-win-revives-religious-freedom-debate. 308 138 S.

QUEER SACRIFICE  Speciousness and anxiousness in the Court’s religious hostility finding leaves a frustrating regard for Kennedy’s opinion.  Can such a dubious reasoning undo what had been a strong showing of sexual orientation discrimination under CADA?  Craig and Mullins was refused service and goods because of their sexual orientation.  Phillips was not exempt under CADA’s religious exception.  However, looking at the case through interest convergence theory, the ruling makes more sense psychologically because, although the law stands thinly, the motives are clear.  Under the Court’s perception, Craig and Mullins likely threatened the status quo.    But if the only conclusion drawn from observing the lack of interest convergence in Masterpiece is that dominant authorities—i.e. the Supreme Court—are reluctant to protect less unassimilated sexual minorities, then merely noticing the absence of converging interests would be a limiting feat.  The utility of seeing Derrick Bell’s interest convergence theory demonstrated in the context of gay rights would be constrained as well—like the Court’s majority decision, only half-baked.  Further significance exists in observing that the Court’s interest in preserving a discriminatory status quo had outweighed any interest toward protecting sexual minorities, such as Craig and Mullins, from religious discrimination.  What Masterpiece actually demonstrates is not merely that Bell’s interest convergence thesis exists in the gay movement’s progression, but what Anthony Kreis had identified when he applied Bell’s interest convergence thesis as a predictive model for future gay rights advancements.  He had reiterated Bell’s thesis of involuntary sacrifice in the sexual minority context—a theory Bell called “racial sacrifice” that compliments interest convergence thesis to form what Bell referred to as “racial fortuity.”309   In writing several years before Obergefell and Masterpiece, Kreis was right to import Bell’s racial sacrifice thesis here.

Bell’s Theory  For Bell, interest convergence helped clarify why the Court in Brown v. Board of Education had the opportunity to overturn its previous segregation holding in Plessy v. Ferguson.310  The theory offered a predictive mechanism for exploring when dominant powers would ever accommodate marginalized groups.  Yet, interest convergence is merely one piece of Bell’s later theory of racial fortuity.  In the context of that racial fortuity theory, interest convergence is merely one variable that is complimented by another theory:  racial sacrifice.  Within the struggles to overcome racial inequality, Bell defined racial sacrifice as the way “the society is always willing to sacrifice the rights of black people in order to protect important economic or political interests of whites.”311  Bell later reiterated racial sacrifice as a predictive moniker—in the inverse logic of interest convergence—to expect when the white dominant power will decide not to weld their authority for legal and political change that would help advance interests of marginalized racial groups, such as African-Americans: “Even when interest-convergence results in an effective racial remedy, that remedy will be abrogated at the point that policymakers fear the remedial policy is threatening the superior societal status of whites, particularly those in the middle and upper classes.”312  Both interest convergence and racial sacrifice are “two sides of the same coin.  The two-sided coin, with involuntary racial sacrifice on the one side and interest-convergent remedies on the other, can be referred to as racial fortuity.”313  Consequently, Bell conceptualizes the underpinnings of racial progress through “racial fortuity,” which are animated by instances of interest convergence and racial sacrifice.314  And if                                                  310 163 U.S. 537 (1896). 311 Derrick Bell, “Here Come De Judge”: The Role of Faith in Progressive Decision-Making, 51 HASTINGS L.J. 1, 8 (1999) [hereinafter Bell, “Here Come De Judge”]. 312 Bell, SILENT COVENANTS, supra n. __, at 69. 313 Id. 314 Kathleen A.

For example, he saw racial sacrifice during the original drafting of the Constitution when slavery was protected to bolster slave owner support for the document.316   Bell also considered the Hayes-Tilden Compromise in 1877 that staved off resurgence of the Civil War as racial sacrifice at the expense of the rights of Southern blacks.317  As a third example, he also saw racial sacrifice in the way that the Court in Plessy constitutionally permitted segregation as a way to engender white support for existing economic policies that were not favoring white people.318  Within the school desegregation era after Brown, Bell adopted the view that white resistance to desegregation lingered long after the landmark decision, which affected implementation of desegregation but that decision itself had left room for white resistance through its subtle deference to Southern whites.319  Kathleen Bergin, in her study of Bell’s racial fortuity theory, concentrates on this observation as a way that the Brown eventually led to racial sacrifice:    The seeds of racial sacrifice were planted even prior to the announcement of Brown, when a number of Justices voiced concern during the Court's judicial conferences for the impact desegregation would have on Whites. No matter how irrational “prosegregation emotion,” Justice Jackson wrote, “we can hardly deny the existence of sincerity and passion of those who think that their blood, birth and lineage are                                                  315 Bell, SILENT COVENANTS, supra n. __, at 9. 316 Bell, “Here Come De Judge,” supra n. __, at 8. 317 Id.  318 Id. at 8-9. 319 Bell, SILENT COVENANTS, supra n. __, at 95. 64         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

In addition, Bergin observes that in implementing Brown, the Court’s “all deliberate speed” standard for schools to comply with desegregation left some directives unclear:   The [Brown] decree instructed local school boards to make a “prompt and reasonable start” towards full desegregation, but district courts charged with monitoring compliance were never told when desegregation should begin, when it should end, or what pace of progress to demand in between. They were instead instructed to move cautiously and authorized to interrupt a desegregation plan once it began if circumstances warranted “additional time.” The Justices hoped this cooling off period would induce voluntary compliance from the South, but only prolonged delay by relinquishing oversight to “the most recalcitrant judge and the most defiant school board.”322                                                  320 Bergin, supra n. __, at 285. 321 135 S.

By analogy, the Obergefell Court mandated marriage equality by state courts, but left the contours of implementations vague—especially the tensions with religious freedom—which led to resistance immediately after the decision with local clerks refusing to issue marriage licenses323 and judges who tried to disobey the ruling,324   To further hone in on her observation of racial sacrifice in the desegregation era, Bergin observes that “[i]mmediately after Brown, the Court let stand a series of district court judgments that distinguished between ‘integration’ and ‘desegregation’ by recognizing a right of White school children to avoid compulsory integration with Blacks.”325  Lower courts followed suit and eventually “[t]he distinction between ‘desegregation’ and ‘integration’ established in these cases led to the proliferation of ‘freedom of choice’ plans, transfer provisions and other measures that maintained actual segregation while purporting to comply with Brown.”326  Here it is not difficult to compare Bergin’s identification of racial sacrifice post-Brown and the Obergefell Court’s deference to religious beliefs to the Masterpiece Court’s use of religious exercise to foreclose sexual orientation antidiscrimination.  Between Bell and Bergin, their post-Brown observations of racial sacrifice resemble the homophobic reactions after Obergefell and stalled progress in Masterpiece. 2. Queering Bell’s Theory in Masterpiece     If one can conclude that interest convergence did occur in Obergefell and in other gay rights decisions327—then it is also possible to apply the rest of Bell’s thesis toward interpreting the mechanism of advancements in justice for sexual minorities.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. Obergefell signified interest convergence, then Masterpiece with its lack of converging interests could stand an example of the kind of involuntary sacrifice akin to what Bell and Bergin pegged as racial sacrifice post-Brown—only here perhaps what the Masterpiece decision represents is a moment of “queer sacrifice.”       To reiterate the definition of racial sacrifice, Bell’s own pronouncement is used:  “Even when interest-convergence results in an effective racial remedy, that remedy will be abrogated at the point that policymakers fear the remedial policy is threatening the superior societal status of whites, particularly those in the middle and upper classes.”328  Bell’s theory is applicable to Masterpiece.  At the start of the case, the effective remedy available to sexual minorities against sexual orientation discrimination was Colorado’s public accommodations law.329  CADA’s inclusion of sexual orientation likely resulted in interest convergence at the state level, since that category was not always included in the act. As Kennedy even notes in Masterpiece, CADA’s protection of sexual minorities against discrimination in places of public accommodation was an addition made in 2007 and 2008.330  Prior to this amendment, sexual orientation had been an absent trait for CADA protection.  In this way, the Colorado state legislature’s later addition to include sexual orientation as a protected class within its state antidiscrimination law was likely an instance of interest convergence that resulted in a remedy for protecting sexual minorities.331 This specific instance of interest convergence could have been facilitated also by the Court’s decision in Romer v. Evans in 1996, striking down Colorado’s Amendment 2, which specifically denied protections for sexual orientation discrimination.332  In addition, since Masterpiece was following the Court’s marriage equality decision in Obergefell, an interpretation could also be made that interest convergence could have contributed to another effective remedy for sexual minorities here, even though the facts of Masterpiece                                                  328 Bell, SILENT COVENANTS, supra n. __, at 69. 329 Colo.

The references to Obergefell in respondents’ briefs could reasonably allow such an inference; Craig and Mullins were trying to use Obergefell to leverage the outcome of their case.333  Thus, likely the Court’s own interest convergence in Romer and Obergefell influenced the available relief at this judicial level of review.  In other words, the couple had CADA on their side—especially after the lower proceedings.  But they were also following Obergefell directly, and had Romer in the remote shadows.  Alternatively, one could plausibly read CADA as the only remedial relief available for Craig and Mullins or respectively use Obergefell to that same effect—hence the various starting points for grafting Bell’s theory of racial sacrifice onto Masterpiece.  However, because Masterpiece was a Supreme Court decision reviewing CADA, a conflation of both CADA and prior Supreme Court gay rights cases seems more appropriate for satisfying the extension of Bell’s sacrifice theory here.  From here, it is possible to read into Masterpiece the effect that Craig and Mullins’ less-assimilated, destabilizing sexual identities had toward producing the Court’s reversal of their successful CADA discrimination claim against the religious baker, Phillips.  Borrowing Bell’s description of racial fortuity, conditions that had been fortuitous for marriage equality and same-sex couples in the Obergefell case were now changed in Masterpiece.334  As discussed above, the Masterpiece couple did not embody the assimilated traits of the Obergefell plaintiffs and they did not share perceived mainstream American characteristics or demographics, nor did they seem similar to the identities of the Justices themselves.  Instead, their queer identities deemed them more like outsiders to either the American mainstream or elite, assimilated gay populations.  Instead of fitting in with perceived heteronormative ideals of family and gender roles, Craig and Mullins played with androgyny and repeatedly displayed their sexuality in public for the media to harness.  They did not have family-oriented obligations such as childrearing.  When they should have been more politically quiet, they did not relent.  They did not present themselves as having respectable jobs or careers.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. traditional dominant ideas about gender, family, and respectability, they appeared threatening to the heteronormative status quo in ways that the Obergefell plaintiffs had not. Their perceived non-conformity cost them.    Moreover, their discrimination claim involved religious beliefs that reaffirmed the dominant, heteronormative status quo—specifically Christian beliefs against same-sex marriages held by a deeply-religious merchant.  In following Bell’s theory of racial sacrifice, it might be possible enough for queer sacrifice to take place when the facts present a sexual orientation discrimination suit filed by a same-sex couple whose destabilizing sexual identities threaten the status quo more than other assimilated same-sex couples would.  However, what could seem even more threatening to the Court was how that sexual orientation discrimination suit by this non-conforming queer couple directly confronted religion through a moment of Christian antipathy toward same-sex marriages.  This direct confrontation with religion offered the tipping point to which the Court responded by reversing the Court of Appeals’ decision favoring the couple, not by finding fault with the CADA claim itself but through a questionable finding of religious hostility with the lower proceedings.  It could be likely that the Court’s protection of religion—thus reflecting its interest in protecting the heteronormative status quo—was provoked by anxiety over having to protect queerness under CADA, even if marriage equality legally existed.  The reversal in Masterpiece seemed likely as an abrogation of effective remedies under CADA because otherwise the couple’s use of remedies under CADA would somehow threaten the dominant group.  It would have led to an acknowledgement of their queerness.  Accordingly, Masterpiece extends of Bell’s racial sacrifice theory—but as an instance of queer sacrifice.  If interest convergence has already been observed in other moments within  the LGTBQ movement, then one could plausibly read instances in which sexual minorities did not prevail, such as Masterpiece here, as queer sacrifice within a similar—perhaps, identical—mechanism of sexual minority justice similar to Bell’s theory of racial fortuity.  Only here, we have queer fortuity instead of racial fortuity.

As much as this Part III has shown that Bell’s thesis has been appropriate for explaining Masterpiece, his thesis can also guide forward.  Part IV explores such possibilities. IV.  QUEER FORTUITY At first glance, the Masterpiece decision ought to engender various levels of pessimism for sexual minorities in the post-marriage equality era.  From Part III’s discussion, the decision reveals significant limits with the level of formal legal equality that assimilated same-sex couples had received in Obergefell.  Masterpiece illustrates the constraints of both marriage rights and sameness arguments, and exhibits the lengths at which the Court will take to preserve a discriminatory status quo in light of protecting sexual minorities who appear less mainstream.  This result is so even when Craig and Mullins had an effective legal remedy to secure under CADA.  Legal commentators have drawn multiple conclusions about the case depending on each commentator’s the level of pessimism.  Some regard the decision as narrow; while others disagree.335  But by applying Bell’s theory, this Article has argued that Masterpiece was a setback for the gay movement—a movement that has by now largely shifted away from employing grassroots liberationist tactics pinned on transforming existing hegemony to more assimilative strategies rooted in identity politics and single-issue causes that are often more salient to what matters to the elite-tier demographic of the sexual minority population.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission.  As the Court’s reversal of Craig and Mullins’ CADA discrimination claim has perhaps showed, so long as the kind of sexual minorities seeking remedial protection under anti-discrimination laws seem to pose a threat to the status quo, the interest to protect them is less aligned than when the litigants seemed more assimilated and respectable.  As a result, the status quo will be preserved if a solution to do so exists.  In Masterpiece, that solution involved prioritizing an already-existing aspect of the dominant status quo:  anti-gay religious belief.  As an instance of queer sacrifice, the Court used religious freedom to undo the substance of Craig and Mullins’ public accommodations claim of sexual orientation discrimination, while legitimizing Phillips’ right to refuse the couple’s wedding cake request because of his religious beliefs.   Masterpiece’s legal contours, of course, beg the question of how sexual orientation anti-discrimination claims at the Court might succeed in the future.  A few weeks after releasing the decision, Justice Kennedy, the swing vote and author of previous gay rights decisions, as well as the author of Masterpiece’s majority opinion here, retired from the Court’s membership.336  With his retirement, the Court’s new composition tips ever more socially and politically conservative, and thus, more directionally challenged to recognizing the rights of sexual minorities.337  Even if anti-discrimination legislation that protects sexual identity were to pass federally, such as the proposed Equality Act,338 what would prevent the Court from denying an otherwise valid instance of sexual orientation discrimination if the interests of uphold such protection failed to converge with the interests of status quo protection?

The Court is now a less gracious and promising venue for sexual minorities than when it decided the marriage cases.  But the problem of strategy for true equality should not have been exclusively hinged on the legal forum.339  Assimilationist strategies based on changing organizational practices in the gay movement that survived since AIDS epidemic campaigns have professionalized the face of gay rights lobbying and political organization.340  Some of the blame for the limitations in Masterpiece lies also within the narrower, single-issue approaches—such as marriage equality—that funneled gay rights into identity politics and a politics of respectability.  Unfortunately, respectability politics played into the dominance and power of the mainstream culture, rather than gaining equal footing with the mainstream.  Perhaps engaging within a politics of respect for all types of sexual identities, instead, would have avoided a more accommodating position against the mainstream.  Even worse, if Bell was correct in interpreting his own racial fortuity theory, then his observation stands that racial progress—and likely advancements for other marginalized groups—are “pre-ordained” by the back-and-forth process of interest convergence and involuntary sacrifice at the hands of the dominant power rather than considered as “hard-earned entitlement[s].”341  Placing this notion within the context of sexual orientation antidiscrimination, Bell’s remark here about the illusion of hard-earned entitlements in successes driven by interest convergence would even pierce or debunk the respectability politics that the Obergefell plaintiffs had courted with in order to obtain married equality.  One previous strand of conceptualizing Obergefell has focused on how same-sex couples there had earned their entitlement to marriage through their appearances of respectability—by how much their sameness                                                  339 Bell, SILENT COVENANTS, supra n. __, at 185-86. 340 Marie-Amélie George, The LGBT Disconnect: Politics and Perils of Legal Movement Formation, 2018 WIS.

However, if applying racial fortuity to explain gay rights advancements, then Bell would perhaps offer an even more cynical view than respectability politics.  His theory would deny the view of success in Obergefell as any hard-earned entitlement.  Rather, his theory of fortuity grafted here would conclude that equality for sexual minorities in Obergefell was driven by conditions beyond the control of sexual minority litigants themselves and that “[i]ts departure, when conditions change, is preordained,”342 as it did in Masterpiece.  In this view, Obergefell’s success was pre-ordained by changing conditions that provided sufficient interest convergence; it was not necessarily and solely earned through a showing of respectability.     B.  MASTERPIECE’S MISSED FORTUITY Nevertheless, even if Bell’s theory about racial fortuity could be extended to comprehend the legal and political advancements for sexual minorities, this thesis ought not to stifle the movement, nor the aspirations for true equality.  Indeed, to combat the dilemma of racial fortuity, Bell responded with a strategy he called “forged fortuity.”343  Drawing on the view here that Masterpiece represents queer sacrifice and that the movement for advancing true equality for sexual minorities could be similarly understood within Bell’s racial fortuity thesis—albeit, “queer fortuity” here—sexual minorities might benefit from Bell’s call to persist with forged fortuity, which he described as focusing less on the judiciary for results and “more on tactics, actions, and even attitudes that challenge the continuing assumptions of white dominance.”344  In particular, Bell had insisted that African-Americans “initiate and support actions that seemingly fly in the face of interest-convergence principles when those actions make life more bearable for blacks in a society where blacks are a permanent, subordinate class.”345  In such a                                                  342 Id. 343 See, e,g., id. at 190.  344 Id. at 9. 345 Id. at 190. 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    73   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

In some ways, one could recapitulate that forged fortuity represents action by a marginalized group to maximize self-interest in a way that harnesses the group’s power (rather than playing into the dominant authority) to drive forth common interests between the marginalized and dominant groups for producing meaningful, even transformative, change.                                                  346 Id. 347 Id. 348 Id.  349 Id. at 191. 350 Id.  74         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

By interpreting major gay rights cases, such as Obergefell and Masterpiece, through an extension of Bell’s theories, we receive insight about how such successes and defeats gained and suffered by sexual minorities are actually still predicated within the status quo, rather than actual victories that transform the status quo.  Thus, in hindsight, perhaps Craig and Mullins might have benefitted from legal arguments that had a larger focus on forging fortuity, rather than relying predominately on persuasions based within constitutional doctrine. Like the lunch counter sit-ins or William Robert Ming’s defense of Dr. King, Craig and Mullins might have raised reasons why sustaining discrimination against sexual minorities might not be economically viable for those controlling the status quo—not to say that this line of reasoning would have categorically altered Masterpiece’s course, but it perhaps would have played into neoliberal sensibilities of the Supreme Court Justices without affecting respectability politics.351  On below, the Colorado Court of Appeals had raised the economics issue, by noting that sexual orientation discrimination in public places incur “measurable adverse economic effects.”352  The Court of Appeals had even referenced a Michigan study that discussed how discriminatory business practices against sexual minorities had negative economic impacts on employers and for business profits state-wide.353  On appeal to the Supreme Court in Masterpiece, the petitioner’s brief by Phillips’ attorneys unilaterally contested this point, downplaying the Court of Appeals’ analysis.354  But neither the Commission’s nor Craig and Mullins’ respondents’ briefs meaningfully addressed the economics of sexual orientation discrimination to combat the denial in Phillips’ petitioner’s brief.355  Rather, the economic impact of the sexual orientation discrimination was only left for prominent debate for amici—                                                 351 David Singh Grewal & Jedediah Purdy, Introduction: Law and Neoliberalism, 2014 LAW & CONTEMP.

FORGING FORTUITY THROUGH COALITION BUILDING Following Bell’s theory, others, in the context of race, have articulated multiracial coalition-building as an important general strategy for forging fortuity.358  “Interest,” as Sheryll Cashin perceives in her study of Bell’s thesis, “is the recognized tactical or strategic advantage that one racial group can gain by forming a coalition with another group.”359  In this sense, she remarks that “[t]here is a hopeful upside to Bell’s interest-convergence thesis:  broad coalitions for progressive social change are theoretically possible when common interests, or a convergence of enlightened self-interest, can be established.”360  Cashin’s examples of such coalition-building that transcends interest-convergence principles include “coalitions among Asians, Latinos, and blacks [that] tend to be quite strong when formed around issues that all three groups benefit from, such as eliminating poverty or unemployment or discrimination.”361  Patience Crowder concurs with Cashin in her recent articulation of Bell’s interest convergence thesis from a transactional perspective:  “[W]ithout significant coalition building among all relevant interest groups concerned about a particular issue, the unalignment of interests cannot only undo the outcome that resulted from a convergence of those interests but can actually abrogate any progress made during the period of convergence.”362                                                   356 See Brief Amici Curiae of Law and Economics Scholars, Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., 138 S.

Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. In Catherine Smith’s work on “outsider” interest convergence, Smith augments Cashin’s coalition-building idea by adding that within large coalitions, “members of subordinated groups go even further and identify how what are perceived to be white middle class, heterosexual norms and the subordinated groups’ respective group’s failures to conform to those norms serve to marginalize each group and all groups in the coalition.”363  Doing so “may also reveal how we each, even as members of subordinated groups, play a role in perpetuating the status quo”364 and how to respond to it collectively with action.365 Of course, one danger of coalitions amongst different racial demographics, as Cashin admits, is how such multiracial coalition building might break down when specific intra-group ideologies or antagonism interfere with the cohesion of converging self-interests.366  The hurdle of multiracial coalitions is for finding “a common interest that is significant enough to overcome any ideological differences.”367  Scott Cummings responds with two different takes on overcoming this hurdle.  First, he mentions Reva Siegel’s view that “it is the power of countermobilization in politics . . . that causes social movements to reframe their claims in terms that can attract widespread mainstream support.”368  Secondly, Cummings also restates Gerald Torres’ perspective that “movements can succeed in shifting cultural norms in progressive directions so long as ‘non-elite actors have . . . a voice earlier in the agenda setting process’ thus ensuring the adequacy of their representation.”369  Both views give a less worrisome take on the political differences with large multiracial coalitions.   In the advancement for true equality for sexual minorities, Bell’s forged fortuity strategies could help combat the cycle of interest convergence and queer sacrifice that continue to                                                  363 Catherine Smith, Unconscious Bias and \"Outsider\" Interest Convergence, 40 CONN.

Given the complexities between racial and queer subordinations, some differences in forging fortuities in the context of race versus sexuality might occur.  However, some commentators within the sexual minority movement have also noted the need for better coalition building that shifts the movement away from the professionalized, single-issue, identity politics organizing of recent decades.  Through coalitions, Bell’s theory might bring the movement back to liberationist roots and view change not just in terms of formal equality but in terms of transforming the current world—i.e. that discriminatory status quo.  In line with views about coalition-building for the sexual minority movement, some prominent LGBTQ voices have posited similarly.  Political science scholar Craig Rimmerman notes that “[a] central goal of radical democratic politics is to build permanent coalitions around political strategies and concrete public policies that cut across race, class, and gender divides, coalitions that will be ready to respond to the Christian Right’s distortions in all political arenas.”370  Historian Martin Duberman writes that in the advancement of sexual minorities the imperative for coalition building exists.  Especially in the post-Obergefell, post-Obama era, there might be a current spirit for “resistance” but “the parts do not cohere, and may never—not without a seismic effort to overcome our penchant for single-issue politics that caters solely to our own primary concerns.”371  He urges further “we must combine with allies who we don’t love but who share with us a common enemy—the country’s oligarchic structure, its patriarchal author, and its primitively fundamentalist moral values.”372 In the short years before Obergefell, queer activist Urvashi Vaid wrote that mainstream gay rights organizations’ assimilative approaches have reduced the movement’s goals.373  In part, this result is so because of the narrow vision of equality                                                  370 RIMMERMAN, THE LESBIAN AND GAY MOVEMENTS, supra n. __, at 160. 371 MARTIN DUBERMAN, HAS THE GAY MOVEMENT FAILED 206-07 (2018). 372 Id. at 207. 373 URVASHI VAID, IRRESISTIBLE REVOLUTION: CONFRONTING RACE, CLASS, AND THE ASSUMPTIONS OF LGBT POLITICS 4 (2012) [hereinafter VAID, IRRESISTIBLE REVOLUTION]. 78         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. that resonates only with the powerful factions of the mainstream gay movement and causes the movement to conceptualize changes within the framework of equality that are set ultimately by the dominant status quo.374   This notion might add to the reasons for explaining why the Obergefell and Masterpiece cases resulted the way they did, and how they extend Bell’s interest-convergence and sacrifice thesis into gay rights, showing that progress is always “pre-ordained” by the dominant powers at play.  Recognition of sexual identity is not the same as allowing sexual minorities the ability to also live full lives.375  The goal is not just true equality, but human flourishing.  Change must affect the status quo in a way that transforms current hegemonic ideas about sexual minorities and result in a redistribution of justice.376 To that end, Vaid writes that   [w]ithout a more substantive definition of equality, without a commitment to its extension to all LGBT people, without deeper and more honest appraisals of the limits of the traditions to which LGBT people seek admission, without a willingness to risk gains made for the opportunity to create a world that truly affirms the intrinsic moral and human worth of people’s sexual, racial, and gender difference, the LGBT politics currently pursued will yield only conditional equality, a simulation of freedom contingent on “good behavior.”377  To displace this continuing phenomenon, she proposes a “justice-based movement” as a type of “re-formed LGBT movement focused on social justice.”378  It would be committed to recognizing the different racial and economic demographics of sexual minorities379 and expanding a definition of equality that is more comprehensive.380  Such a movement would broaden the missions of major LGBT organizations, make them more inclusive and                                                  374 Id. at 8-20. 375 Id. at 16-17. 376 Id. at 21. 377 Id. at 5. 378 Id. at 20. 379 Id. at 20-21.  380 Id. at 21-22. 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    79   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

Specifically, she mentions that “[f]or many decades, progressives have talked about the need to link up with each other beyond identity, around shared values and goals.”385  Thus, instead of working in political silos, “[w]e who have been working for LGBT liberation certainly do not see our goal as building a gay silo or living in one.”386  Those moves would be assimilative.  Rather “[w]e see our work instead as building common ground.”387  Vaid’s conception of coalition-building is broad, philosophical, and liberationist, compared to the assimilative methods of lobbying by current mainstream gay rights organizations.  It also approaches Cashin, Crowder, and Smith’s extensions of Bell’s forged fortuity.  Reaching back to Bell’s iterations of forged fortuity, like white dominance, sexual minorities must presume heterosupremacy at play in everyday ordinary life.388  Because of                                                  381 Id. at 22-28. 382 Bell, SILENT COVENANTS, supra n. __, at 9. 383 Id. at 29. 384 Id. at 202. 385 Id. at 203. 386 Id. 387 Id. at 204. 388 Bell, SILENT COVENANTS, supra n. __, at 190. 80         QUEER SACRIFICE                         [Vol. __   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism. Please do not cite or circulate without author’s permission. that supremacy, queer people are often undermined or subordinated—whether they are planning to get married, applying for a job, renting an apartment, or shopping for a cake.  Understanding this perspective, sexual minorities ought to be subversive and work actively to protect self-interest but also not eager to sell out just to gain access to the dominant status quo.389  Through inter- and intra-group interest convergence, coalitions must be formed with other marginalized people; and they must exist and protest collectively in ways that resemble in spirit the lunch counter sit-ins that Bell mentioned—against the dominant status quo as the cost and expense for reinforcing discriminatory beliefs and practices.  The larger and more robust the coalitions are, the less advantageous it would be in the dominant group’s interest to sustain discrimination.  Together with other groups, sexual minorities ought to able to create change that is lasting, transformative, and indeed liberationist.  Scholarly calls for coalition building echo each other.  On more liberationist terms, all of these calls could be workable as examples of forging fortuity.  Within the racial context, the scholarly observations for coalition building with common interests externalize Bell’s forged fortuity.  Brought into the sexual minority context, the call for broad coalition building—particularly one that appears more transformative—echoes the need not only to combat a continuing inequality imposed against sexual minorities by those operating within a discriminatory status quo, but also the need to resolve the intra-group marginalization between assimilated, elite gays and lesbians and sexual minorities living outside that sub-category.390    These overlapping calls and suggestions for coalition building are more liberationist than assimilative.  Because such coalition building would hopefully seek to challenge the hegemony and not play into it, in that sense, a reformed movement that forges its own fortuity by coalescing around values and issues beyond identity politics should be broad and should earnestly be investigated as the next step forward. 391  It invariably ought to dial the LGBTQ                                                  389 See id. 390 Nourafshan & Onwuachi-Willig, supra n. __, at 540-41.  391 Bergin, supra n. __, at 303. 2019]                           QUEER SACRIFICE                                    81   Forthcoming, to be published in the Yale Journal of Law & Feminism.

CONCLUSION Sexual minorities still live at the mercy of the dominant status quo.  By conceptualizing Masterpiece as an example of queer sacrifice and seeing how Bell’s theory of fortuity fits appropriately over the progressive ebb and flow of the sexual minority movement, it is possible to perceive that the movement needs to forge its own fortuity in order to further antidiscrimination efforts and effectively reach toward the state of true equality and human flourishing.  To that end, coalition building that focuses on common values and interests rather than identity politics might be the solution to press upon upending the dominant status quo.  And within such coalitions, liberationist approaches might need to guide the movement to advance more collectively and transformatively.   ",

    "abstract": "This Article interprets the Supreme Court’s 2018 decision,  Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission , as a critical extension of Derrick Bell’s interest convergence thesis into the LGBTQ movement. Chiefly, Masterpiece reveals how the Court has been more willing to accommodate gay individuals who appear more assimilated and respectable—such as those who participated in the marriage equality decisions—than LGBTQ individuals who are less “mainstream” and whose exhibited queerness appear threatening to the heteronormative status quo. When assimilated same-sex couples sought marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, their respectable personas facilitated the alignment between their interests to marry and the Court’s interest in affirming the primacy of marriage. Masterpiece, however, demonstrates that when the litigants’ sexual identities seem less assimilated and more destabilizing to the status quo, the Court becomes much less inclined to protect them from discrimination and, in turn, reacts by reinforcing its interest to preserve the status quo—one that relies on religious freedoms to fortify heteronormativity. To push this observation further, this Article explores how such failure of interest convergence in Masterpiece extends Derrick Bell’s thesis on involuntary racial sacrifice and fortuity into the LGBTQ context—arguing that essentially Masterpiece is an example of queer sacrifice. Thus, using the appositeness of critical race thinking, this Article regards the reversal in Masterpiece as part of the contours of interest convergence, queer sacrifice, and fortuity in the LGBTQ movement. Such observations ultimately prompt this Article to propose specific liberationist strategies that the movement ought to adopt in forging ahead",
