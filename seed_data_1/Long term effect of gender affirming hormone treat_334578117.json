However, the effect of GAHT on mental health in transgender people, and the role of other factors that may have a predictive effect, is poorly explored.Objectives: Using a longitudinal methodology, this study investigated the effect of 18-month GAHT on depression and anxiety symptomatology and the predictors on mental health outcomes in a large population of transgender people.Materials and methods: Participants (n = 178) completed a socio-demographic ques-tionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient—Short Version (AQ-Short) at pre-assessment (T0) and at 18 months after initiation of GAHT (T1).Results: From T0 to T1, symptomatology was significantly decreased for depression (P < .001) and non-significantly reduced for anxiety (P = .37). Scores on the MSPSS predicted reduction in depression, while scores on the AQ-Short predicted reduction in anxiety.Discussion: GAHT reduces symptoms of depression which are predicted by having higher levels of social support. Although anxiety symptoms also reduce, the changes are not significant and high levels of anxiety still remain post-GAHT.Conclusions: These results highlight the important mental health benefits of GAHT. Support services (professional, third sector or peer support) aiming at increasing so-cial support for transgender individuals should be made available.K E Y W O R D Sautism, hormone therapy, longitudinal, mental health, social support, transgender2  |     ALDRIDGE Et AL.1  | INTRODUC TIONTreatment-seeking transgender people who are not on hormone treatment have reported high levels of mental health problems, particularly anxiety, depression and self-harm, which are likely caused by a number of internal and external stressors.1-12 Studies examining mental health in transgender people have primarily fo-cused on individuals attending transgender health services and hence those who are likely to experience a higher level of distress about their assigned sex at birth. These studies have primarily looked cross-sectionally at levels of anxiety,7,13,14 depression7,15-17 and self-harm.18-20With regard to anxiety, several studies have demonstrated high levels in transgender people before gender-affirming hormone treatment (GAHT).21,22 For example, Bouman et al 13 found that levels of anxiety in transgender people were three times higher than those in a matched sample from the general population. This study also found that transgender males were more anxious than transgender females. Interestingly, the high scores on autistic traits found among this population have been suggested to be a product of the high levels of anxiety and low self-esteem often experienced by this group15 and not autism per se.23 However, a recent study has demonstrated stability in autistic traits following GAHT.24Similar to anxiety, high levels of depression have also been re-ported in transgender individuals, prior to GAHT.16,18,22 Witcomb et al16 reported that transgender people prior to receiving GAHT had a fourfold increased risk of a probable depressive disorder compared to a matched control sample from the general popu-lation. Why this is the case is unclear, but social factors such as lack of general social support,9,25-27 parental support28 and peer support have been found to be associated with depressive symp-toms among transgender people.29,30 Experiences of transphobic discrimination are associated with increased odds of suffering from depression31 independent of other types of discrimination, for example racism. This suggests that transgender people who are ethnic minorities are at even greater risk, because of the inter-sectional experience of discriminatory events. In addition, while unemployment increases the risk of depression in the general pop-ulation32 and transgender people have been found to have a higher unemployment rate than cisgender people33—being in employ-ment is associated with higher levels of experienced transphobia and fear of disclosing mental health problems in the transgender population.34,35Another factor that has been associated with mental health problems in treatment-seeking transgender people is age. Younger transgender people report high levels of bullying36 and very high levels of self-harm,19,37 which have been associated with increased anxiety as well as effects on self-esteem, family relationships and social life, which all negatively influence mental well-being.While these studies have provided valuable insight, the use of cross-sectional methodologies to examine the impact of the above factors, particularly the role of GAHT in mental health, is limited. Therefore, it is critical to explore this on a within-subject basis using a longitudinal design. This is the most effective approach to show the effects of GAHT on mental health as it provides the opportunity to examine individuals prior to and during GAHT.A small number of longitudinal studies that focus on the effect of GAHT on mental health do exist. Colizzi et al38 reported sig-nificant reductions in mental health symptoms after the initiation of GAHT with anxiety reducing from 50% to 17% and depression from 24% to 11%. Heylens et al39 also showed significant reduc-tions in symptoms of anxiety and depression after the initiation of GAHT to the point where they resemble those of the general population. These studies are, however, not without limitations. Heylens et al’s39 study has a small sample size (n = 57), while Colizzi et al’s38 study is limited by the lack of evaluation of factors that may have impacted on the mental health of their participants, such as social support. Both studies describe the need to repli-cate their findings. In contrast, Bränström and Pachankis40 using the Swedish population register showed no significant association between the likelihood of accessing mental health treatment and time since initiation of GAHT. The limitation of their study includes primarily that accessing mental health services does not neces-sarily reflect actual mental health and there is little additional in-formation about the type of mental health treatment received by their participants. These limitations mean that this study cannot provide reliable evidence regarding the role of GAHT on the men-tal health symptoms of transgender people, and this information is vital in order to provide an evidence base of GAHT improving overall quality of life of transgender people.While the available longitudinal studies have provided valuable evidence of the effect of GAHT on transgender people's mental health, there is a requirement to replicate these studies addressing their limitations. With this in mind, the primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of GAHT on anxiety and depression symp-toms. The study will focus on those who have been on treatment for over 18 months as this allows for enough time for GAHT to pro-duce physical, bodily changes but before surgical procedures have taken place, which could bias the results. As some physical changes can be quicker in assigned females at birth than in assigned males at birth (eg voice change with testosterone),2 which can affect men-tal health outcome following GAHT, the results of GAHT in anxi-ety and depression for both groups will be presented separately. It is hypothesized that an improvement in mental health will take place in those assigned male and female at birth following GAHT treatment. Unfortunately, because of the long waiting list for gen-der-affirming surgical treatment in the United Kingdom (UK), it is unlikely that people will have undergone these interventions before this time. The secondary aim of this study is to examine pre-GAHT factors which may be predicting changes in anxiety and depression following GAHT. The predictors selected for this study are based on the literature and include ethnicity, age, assigned sex at birth, civil status, employment, social support, and autistic traits. This study hypothesized that symptoms of depression and anxiety would be significantly decreased after 18 months of GAHT.     |  3ALDRIDGE Et AL.2  | MATERIAL S AND METHODS2.1 | ParticipantsParticipants were invited to take part through a national transgender health service in Nottingham, UK. This service is part of the National Health Service (NHS) and offers assessment for suitability of GAHT as well as chest and genital reconstructive surgery. The service also offers GAHT and speech and language therapy. The service accepts referrals from people aged 17 and over who are seeking, or consider-ing, medical transition.2.2 | ProceduresThe sample consisted of individuals who attended an assessment at the transgender health service from November 2014 to March 2018, who agreed participation and who were not on GAHT prior to the as-sessment. Prior to the clinical assessment, every patient was invited to participate in the study. If agreed, they were invited to complete a baseline questionnaire pack (T0). The pack included a socio-demo-graphics questionnaire (age, sex assigned at birth, gender identity, eth-nicity, employment status, relationship status and whether participants were taking cross-sex hormones and/or blockers pre-assessment—as a significant proportion of young people are referred from the only ex-isting child and adolescent transgender health services in the United Kingdom). Validated questionnaires regarding anxiety and depression (HADS), social support (MSPSS) and autistic traits (AQ-Short) were also included in the information pack. Data were only included if partici-pants returned a signed consent form with the study questionnaires.Participants who consented and returned T0 questionnaires were invited to complete a T1 questionnaire 18 months after com-mencing GAHT. The T1 questionnaire pack consisted of a HADS questionnaire. This allowed a comparison of changes in depression and anxiety symptoms before and after GAHT. Data were collected in October 2019. Except for the data analysis, the study was primar-ily unfunded and set up in a busy clinic.2.3 | Tools2.3.1 | The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)The HADS is a 14-item self-report screening scale originally devel-oped to indicate the possible presence of anxiety and depression states in medical non-psychiatric outpatient clinics.41 The HADS con-sists of two subscales, HADS—Depression (HADS-D) and HADS—Anxiety (HADS-A). Each subscale has seven items that are rated on a 4-point Likert scale that ranges from 0 to 4 with some items being reverse-scored. A maximum total of 21 can be obtained on each subscale. A score of 0-7 on both scales implies a non-clinical range, while a score of 8-10 suggests the possible presence of a depressive or anxiety disorder. A score of 11 or higher suggests the probable presence of a depressive or anxiety disorder. Caseness of depression and anxiety has been suggested for scores above 8.42 The HADS has previously been used with transgender individuals.13,43 For depres-sion (HADS-D), this gave a specificity of 0.7 and a sensitivity of 0.9. For anxiety (HADS-A), this gave a specificity of 0.78 and a sensitivity of 0.9. In this study; Cronbach's alpha for depression was 0.76 and for anxiety 0.68.2.3.2 | The multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS)The MSPSS is a 12-item self-report scale to record levels of social support from family, friends and significant others.44 The measure consists of three subscales to measure the three different types of support. Items are rated on a Likert scale that ranges from 1 (‘very strongly agree’) to 7 (‘very strongly disagree’). To calculate subscale scores, items from each subscale are added together and divided by 4. A total score is calculated by adding together all 12 items and di-viding by 12. The mean and total scores range from 1 to 7 with a higher score indicating a higher level of perceived social support. A mean total scale score ranging from 1 to 2.9 can be considered low support; a score of 3 to 5 can be considered moderate support; and a score from 5.1 to 7 can be considered high support. The MSPSS has previously been used with transgender individuals.26,45 In this study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.89.2.3.3 | Autism spectrum quotient—short version (AQ-Short)The AQ-Short is a 28-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure autistic traits to give an indication of where the person lies on the continuum of the spectrum, ranging from healthy to autistic.46,47 It is a shortened version of the validated AQ-50.48 It consists of two higher order factors related to autistic traits, includ-ing numbers and patterns (which assess the extent to which peo-ple are fascinated by numbers, dates, patterns and categories) and social behaviours. The AQ-Short is a 4-point Likert scale ranging from ‘definitely agree’ to ‘definitely disagree’, with some items being reverse-scored. Total scores range between 28 and 112. The AQ-Short has previously been used with transgender populations.23,24,49 Higher scores represent higher levels of autistic traits. Although not intended to be a diagnostic tool, a cut-off of ≥ 70 was found to have a sensitivity of 0.94 and specificity of 0.91 to discriminate between an autism sample and a community sample. Cronbach's alpha was 0.86.2.3.4 | Data analysisData analyses were performed using the Statistical Software Package Stata 16.50 Stata 16 was used to conduct power analysis. Only those 4  |     ALDRIDGE Et AL.participants not on GAHT at assessment (T0) were included in the re-gression analysis. All missingness was imputed using analytical model with 20 imputed data sets generated for each model. Paired sample t tests were used to determine whether there had been a significant change in the HADS-D and HADS-A subscales from T0 to T1. Multiple regression was conducted to explore ethnicity, employment status, re-lationship status, age, assigned sex, MSPSS and AQ. The hypothesis regarding whether the specific factors were predictive of changes in anxiety and depression was tested via a moderator analysis, entering only the subscales found to be significant in the linear regressions and a product of their combined centred scores. This was tested via a multi-ple regression. Bonferroni corrections were used to correct multiplicity issue if needed. Although data are not normally distributed, Allison51) states that normality is the least important assumption of regression and as data met the assumptions for linearity, homoscedasticity and absence of multicollinearity or extreme outliers, a multiple regression analysis was conducted. The socio-demographic categories were split into two distinct groups for each category as seen in Table 1. Assigned sex at birth instead of gender identity was used in the socio-demo-graphics in view of the many different gendered identities described, as an analysis based on gender identities would have made the analyses too complex to interpret; this followed previous study approaches.23,24 The MSPSS and AQ-28 Short at T0 were significant factors predicting change in HADS-D and HADS-A at T1. To check the robustness of re-gression estimates sensitive to missingness, all regression models were re-run on observed data only and the results were examined against the results from imputed data set.Ethical approval for the study was received from the NHS Ethics Committee (14/EM/0092) and the Research and Development Department at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in line with Health Research Authority guidance,52 which included approval for individuals aged 17 and over to sign giving their consent without the need for additional parental consent.3  | RESULTS3.1 | Socio-demographic characteristics of the participantsA total of 1,271 participants were assessed between November 2014 and March 2018, completed T0 questionnaires and agreed participation in the study. Seventy-one per cent (N = 906) could be included in the analysis as they had not received hormones prior to assessment. Of these, 178 (20%) went on to complete a T1 question-naire after 18 months of GAHT, indicating a response rate of 20%. Responders did not differ from non-responders in terms of either demographic characteristics or baseline AQ-Short scores, but they were significantly less anxious at baseline than non-responders (me-dian 9 vs 8, P = .001; z = 3.225) (see Table 1).The age range from the 178 participants that completed T0 and T1 questionnaires ranged from 17 to 79 years with a median age of 23 years. More than half of the participants (n = 95; 53.3%) were assigned male sex at birth, and 83 (46.7%) were assigned female sex at birth. The large majority of participants classified themselves as white (n = 167; 94%), were single (n = 120; 69%) and were in em-ployment (n = 75; 41%) or students (n = 58; 32%). Participants who were assigned male sex at birth were more likely to be in employ-ment compared to participants assigned female sex at birth (47% vs 33%), while more participants assigned female sex at birth were sin-gle at the time of assessment (78% vs 57%) and a higher percentage of participants assigned male sex at birth were divorced/separated (18% vs 2%) (see Table 1).TA B L E  1   Socio-demographic characteristics (n,%) and mean (SD) scores on HADS, MSPSS and AQ-Short score of all responders assigned male and female at birthRespondersAssigned male at birth (2)Assigned female at birth (1)n = 178 n = 95 n = 83n% n% n%Age, median (range) years23 (1774) 28 (1779) 21 (1764)Ethnic origin n (%)White 167 94 92 97 75 91Other 11 6 3 3 8 9Not known - - - - - -Employment status n (%)Employed (1) 75 41 45 47 28 33Student (2) 58 32 20 21 37 44Housewife/househusband (4)- - - - - -Voluntary work (3) 7 4 5 5 2 2Retired (6) 5 3 6 6 - -Disabled (5) 7 5 5 5 3 3Unemployed (0) 26 14 14 14 12 14Not known (9) 1 1 1 1Civil status n (%)Single (1) 120 69 55 57 65 78Married (2) 15 7 12 12 1 1Civil partner ( 3) 5 3 - - 5 6In a relationship (7) 4 3 1 1 4 4Divorced/separated (4)20 11 18 18 2 2Widowed (5) 2 2 2 2 1 1Other (6) - - - - - -Not known (9 + Blanks)12 7 7 7 5 6HADSD 7.24 (4.03) 7.03 (4.11) 7.48 (3.94)HADSA 8.07 (4.34) 7.54 (4.31) 8.69 (4.32)MSPSS 4.85 (1.29) 4.64 (1.35) 5.1 (1.16)AQ 64.77 (11.86) 62.83 (11.94)66.97 (11.44)     |  5ALDRIDGE Et AL.3.2 | Anxiety and depression scoresThe mean score for the total group for anxiety was 8.07 (SD: 4.34). It was higher in those assigned female (8.69 (SD: 4.32)) versus those assigned male at birth (7.54 (SD: 4.31). The mean score for depres-sion was 7.24 (SD: 4.03), also higher in assigned females (7.48 (SD: 3.94)) than assigned males at birth (7.03 (SD: 4.11)).At T0 (before hormone treatment), 51.13% of participants scored 8 or over on the HADS-A subscale, and in the case of the HADS-D subscale, 47.75% of participants scored above 8 placing these partic-ipants within the categories of possible to probable presence of an anxiety or depression disorder. At T1, 47.19% of participants scored 8 or above in the HADS-A subscale showing a reduction of 3.94%, and in the HADS-D subscale, 25.84% of people scored 8 or above showing a reduction of 21.91%.3.3 | Change in anxiety and depression scores between T0 and T1There was a statistically significant reduction in mean scores of HADS-D from T0 to T1 (mean change difference, −2.05; 95% CI, −2.72 to −1.38; P = .00). This indicated a reduction in depression following 18 months of GAHT. There was also a reduction in the HADS-A score from T0 to T1, but this was not statistically significant (mean change difference, −0.31; 95% CI, −0.97 to 0.36, P = .37). The same findings (a significant reduction in HADS-D and a non-signifi-cant reduction in HADS-A) were found when comparing T0 and T1 according to sex assigned at birth (see Table 2).3.4 | Predictors of anxiety and depression change after hormone treatmentTwo multiple regressions with seven predictor variables were con-ducted to explore the predictors of change, from T0 to T1, in scores on HADS-D and HADS-A. The predictors for each were ethnicity, employment status, relationship status, assigned sex at birth, and age. MSPSS and AQ-Short at T0 were used as independent variables for both regressions.The results for the first regression showed that overall, the model was significant (F(7,152)=2.09, P = .04) and explained 8.8% (R2 = 0.088) of the total variance in depression scores. The model also showed that mean MSPSS scores at T0 were the only significant predictor of HADS-D change between T0 and T1 (β = 0.81, P = .006). The second regression showed that overall, the model was significant (F(7,152)=2.09, P = .048) and explained 8.8% (R2 = 0.088) of the total variance in anxiety scores. The model also showed mean AQ-Short scores at T0 was a significant predictor of HADS-A change between T0 and T1 (β = −0.069, P = .034). The findings suggest that only levels of social support (MSPSS scores) and autistic spectrum traits (AQ scores) were able to predict changes in anxiety and depression following 18 months of GAHT.

The study found a significant reduction in symptoms of depression in transgender individuals after 18 months of start-ing GAHT, with a more than one-fifth decrease in the number of participants who scores reflected a possible or probable depressive disorder. A statistical reduction of anxiety was not found. While re-ductions in depression, and to a lesser extent anxiety, were seen, a significant proportion of participants still present, post-treatment, with a possible or probable depressive disorder (25.84%) or anxi-ety disorder (47.19%). Data from previous studies in the field were used to compare these findings with the general population.13,16 Acknowledging that direct comparison cannot be made, our study showed that the levels of possible and probable anxiety and depres-sive disorder after GAHT were still significantly higher than those reported in the general population (4.5% for possible or probable depressive disorder16 and 34.5% for possible or probable anxiety disorder).13 Whether these elevated levels will reduce further (when a longer use of GAHT +/− surgical interventions) needs to be ex-plored. Thus, future longitudinal studies would benefit from fol-lowing people for longer in order to track the longer-term impact of interventions.These findings do confirm, once again, the high levels of possi-ble anxiety and depressive disorders before GAHT and the benefit that this treatment brings. It highlights the need to facilitate the expedited use of GAHT to aid the reduction of poor mental health symptoms in the transgender population, when possible and ap-propriate. This conclusion supports the literature which has called for longitudinal studies such as this to replicate the findings from cross-sectional studies.15,16,22,25,38,45 The large reduction in de-pression, comparing to anxiety, may indicate that GAHT targets the dysphoria that many people attending transgender health ser-vices present with, which is manifested as depression (rather than anxiety). The fact that many transgender people still feel anxious after GAHT may be because of the victimisation, discrimination and social rejection experienced by the transgender population.3,5,10,53 Unfortunately for some, these experiences do not necessarily stop after initiation of GAHT, and in some cases, they may increase. Clinical and community services should take these findings into consideration and increase the support offered even after gen-der-affirming medical treatment is over.Importantly, this study also highlights how levels of pre-treat-ment social support are predictive of reduced risk post-treatment, as higher levels of social support prior to receiving GAHT significantly predict a greater reduction in depression symptoms after 18 months of receiving GAHT. This indicates the importance of increasing social support in transgender people.The study also found that those with higher levels of autistic spectrum condition (ASC) traits prior to the receipt of GAHT had lower reductions in anxiety symptoms. This could indicate that those with greater ASC traits have higher anxiety symptoms even after post-treatment or that higher ASC traits are simply reflective of dif-ficulties in social interactions, as a result of being anxious, grounded in an individual's gender identity status. These findings corroborate cross-sectional studies which have shown that interpersonal inter-actions can have an impact upon transgender people's psychological well-being.9,15,23,25,27 However, these results need to be interpreted with caution because of the lack of validity of the AQ-Short in this population.TA B L E  3   Predictive role of ethnicity, employment status, relationship status, assigned gender at birth, age, MSPSS and AQ-Short for change in HADS-D and HADS-A from T0 to T1HADS − D HADS − ACoef. 95% CI P Coef. 95% CI PEthnicity (grouped as White and all other at T0) −0.37 −3.19 to 2.45 .794 −0.67 −3.62 to 2.28 .652Employment (grouped as unemployed and disabled and all other at T0)−0.97 −2.75 to 0.81 .284 −0.51 −2.37 to 1.35 .591Relationship (grouped as single, widowed, divorced/separated and other at T0 and all other)0.31 −1.82 to 2.43 .776 −0.61 −2.83 to 1.62 .590Assigned sex at T0 0.36 −1.21 to 1.93 .651 −0.17 −1.81 to 1.47 .841Age at T0 0.06 −0.50 to 0.61 .843 −0.03 −0.08 to 0.03 .409Mean MSPSS at T0 0.81 0.24 to 1.39 .006 0.56 −0.04 - 1.16 .065Mean AQ − Short at T0 −0.04 −0.096 to 0.025 .250 −0.07 −0.13 to 0.05 .034Constant −1.93 −4.76 to 0.90 .179 0.41 −2.34 to 3.16 .787     |  7ALDRIDGE Et AL.With social support (from families, friends or significant oth-ers) being highlighted as a factor in depression, it is important to consider approaches to aiding in the building of social support net-works for transgender people accessing transgender services. Such support does not necessarily need to be based in clinical settings, as online and offline peer support and the work of tertiary services are available, less stigmatizing and have demonstrated a positive impact.29,30,54 Resources such as peer support workers (PSWs) and online peer-to-peer support may be a valuable tool to provide social support for transgender individuals awaiting and receiving GAHT. Additional support is recommended in particular to those with higher levels of ASC traits because of the lower reductions in anxi-ety symptoms found in this population. However, PSWs need to be appropriately trained in order to reduce any potential risks related to managing their own stress as well as power imbalances within peer and professional relationship.30Regarding expedited access to GAHT, there are practical issues that must be considered.55-57 Many countries either lack clinical services specializing in transgender health care or have significant waiting lists to access these services.13,58-60 These practical issues surrounding accessing treatment can lead to self-prescribing of GAHT, with 23% of individuals referred to transgender health clin-ics using GAHT prior to their first appointment, 70% of which was sourced online.61 Self-prescribing without medical oversight pres-ents its own risks, most notably a lack of specialized knowledge re-quired to minimize health risks.61The issues surrounding access to GAHT may be compounded by how services are configured. The role of many mental health work-ers in transgender health services in the UK is seen as gatekeepers, focused on the assessment of transgender people with limited atten-tion given to psychological support. A shift in roles from gatekeeping to tangible mental health support would allow for a partial address-ing of the power imbalance between transgender people and mental health professionals. This would potentially allow for transgender people to feel more able to discuss issues without fear of rejection for treatment. This in turn would provide mental health profession-als with the ability to focus more on supporting the mental health of those transgender people who need it. From the evidence provided by this study, it appears that this would be most important for those with low levels of social support and those with autistic traits.The strengths of this paper are the large sample and the natural-istic prospective longitudinal design within one transgender health service, which allows for within-subject comparisons and so pro-vides a highly valid insight into the impact of GAHT on depression and anxiety of treatment-seeking transgender people. It is important to add that this is a national NHS service, which offers gender-af-firming medical interventions and assessment free at the point of access to people from different geographical regions within the UK. This study is one of the few in the literature currently addressing the role of GAHT on mental health with such a methodology.There are, however, limitations to the study. We must acknowl-edge that participants may downplay their symptoms of depres-sion and anxiety pre-assessment, for fear of not being treated. Consequently, participants may have attenuated their mental health symptoms because of concern of not being accepted for GAMT. This could indicate that the changes between T0 and T1 may be more sig-nificant than recorded. As the method of recruitment was through a transgender health clinic as part of the NHS, the findings are only generalizable to treatment-seeking transgender individuals. A limita-tion may also be the response rate. Although this is low, it is in line with other clinical studies and it may be a reflection of the unfunded nature of the study. Another limitation is that the sample consisted of predominantly white participants, which may explain why ethnic-ity was not a predictive factor and the lack of control group where the intervention (GAHT) is not being offered (eg waiting list), but this will have its limitations too. A full randomized control study within this area will not be ethically possible. Studies using data from a clin-ical setting must also be aware of the context in which their data are being gathered.In conclusion, this study shows that the mental health of trans-gender individuals improves following GAHT, particularly for those who reported high levels of social support prior to receiving GAHT. These results highlight the important mental health benefits of GAHT and emphasises the need for interventions focused on devel-oping social support for transgender individuals.ACKNOWLEDG EMENTSThe authors thank all participants in the study for having given their time so generously.CONFLIC T OF INTERE S TThe authors have no other conflicts of interest relevant to this arti-cle to disclose.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCross?sectional studies show that transgender people are more likely than cisgender people to experience depression and anxiety before Gender Affirming Hormone Treatment (GAHT). However, the effect of GAHT on mental health in transgender people, and the role of other factors that may have a predictive effect, is poorly explored.ObjectivesUsing a longitudinal methodology, this study investigated the effect of 18 months GAHT on depression and anxiety symptomatology and the predictors on mental health outcomes in a large population of transgender people.Materials and MethodsParticipants (n=178) completed a socio?demographic questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient Short Version (AQ?short) at pre?assessment (T0) and at 18 months after initiation of GAHT (T1).ResultsFrom T0 to T1, symptomatology was significantly decreased for depression (P[less than]0.001) and non?significantly reduced for anxiety (P=0.37). Scores on the MSPSS predicted reduction in depression, while scores on the AQ?short predicted reduction in anxiety.DiscussionGAHT reduces symptoms of depression which are predicted by having higher levels of social support. Although anxiety symptoms also reduce the changes are not significant and high levels of anxiety still remain post GAHT.ConclusionsThese results highlight the important mental health benefits of GAHT. Support services (professional, third sector or peer?support) aiming at increasing social support for transgender individuals should be made available",
