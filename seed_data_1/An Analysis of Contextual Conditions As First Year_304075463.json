Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to analyze the perceptions of the \nPhase 1 Safe Zone training among first year RAs in the residence halls. A secondary \npurpose was to examine how first year RAs perceive their ability to utilize training \nmaterial in order to interact with LGBTQ students and implement programming within \nthe context of the residence hall environment. Findings from the present qualitative study \nsuggest that participants found the Phase One Safe Zone training to be educational and \ntransformative, stating that it allowed them to see the bigger picture and become more \naware of the privileges that they possess. The study's participants also felt that, while \nmuch of the active programming they attempted elicited a lackluster response, it allowed \nthem to create a greater sense of awareness among their residents. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM v \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS ................................................................................................. ii

CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \nChapter I \nIntroduction \n1 \nThere is a misconception in society that anti-homosexual violence is a rare \noccurrence (Schiffman, Delucia-Waack, & Gerrity, 2006). However, according to the \nGay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network's (OLSEN) biennial National School \nClimate Survey (2013), which surveys nearly 8,000 students, 65% heard homophobic \nremarks :frequently or often, 30% missed at least one day of school in the past month \nbecause they felt unsafe or uncomfortable, and 85% were verbally harassed in the past \nyear. In addition, according to this survey, 56% oflesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, \nand queer (LGBTQ) students around the country have experienced discriminatory school \npolicies and practices. Recent legislation has targeted issues such as hate crimes, anti-\ndiscrimination, and gay marriage in an attempt to create equals rights for LGBTQ \ncitizens; however, attitudes within the general public appear slower to change (Schiffman \net al., 2008), as is demonstrated by aforementioned statistics. \nIt is not surprising that societal attitudes of homophobia and heterosexism are also \nreflected on universities and college campuses. College campuses are often perceived to \nbe a safe haven for students. However, based on the results of several studies, incidents \nof heterosexism and homophobia plague students who identify as LGBTQ every day. \nIndividuals who identify as LGBTQ are five times more likely to miss school because \nthey feel unsafe, 28% more likely to dropout of school entirely (Rankin, 2003), and four \ntimes more likely to commit suicide than their heterosexual peers (Jayakumar, 2009). \nAccording to Herek, Gillis, & Cogan (2009), issues ofheterosexism can stifle the \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \npotential of sexual minorities, limit the acknowledgment of LGBTQ perspectives, and \nundermine LGBTQ individuals' contributions to the greater society as well. \n2 \nNegative experiences of stigma-related prejudice, discrimination, and \nvictimization have also been linked to psychological distress amongst LGBTQ youth. In \nfact, the greater the young person's expectation for rejection, based on their \nsexual/gender identity, the more likely they were to report symptoms of anxiety, \ndepression, and suicidal ideation (Kelleher, 2009). In Wickens and Sandlin's (2010) \nstudy a link was also found between students' feelings of safety and educators' levels of \ninaction when dealing with issues of anti-gay harassment and prejudice. According to \nreports from the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN, 2007), 86.2% of \nmiddle- and high-school LGBTQ students experienced harassment at school within the \npast year, 60.8% felt unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation, and 32.7% \nskipped a day of school in the past month because of feeling unsafe. Three-fourths of all \nof the LGBTQ students surveyed (6209) also revealed that they heard homophobic or \nsexist remarks often or frequently at school. Despite these statistics, teachers rarely \nintervened in these situations. In fact, almost 40% of the students surveyed by the \nGLSEN (2007) reported never observing a teacher intervene when homophobic remarks \nwere made in their presence. As a result of this inaction, many students are taught that \nthe schools, and by extension society, condone such behavior, so students see no point in \nreporting the harassment that they experience (Wickens & Sandlin, 2010). Alternatively, \nin a study conducted by the California Safe Schools Coalition (2004), when teachers did \ntake action and intervene, students reported less harassment and increased feelings of \nsafety in school. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 3 \nIn response to educator inaction, as well as the issues ofheterosexism and \nhomophobia and their link to psychological distress, Safe Zone programs and safe space \ninitiatives emerged in high schools and on college campuses nationwide during the \n1990s. These programs prepare participants to provide individual support to LGBTQ \nstudents through an introduction to basic LGBTQ-related terminology and discussions of \nheterosexual privilege, homophobia, and different types of activism. Safe space \ninitiatives, such as the Safe Zone Project, have the potential to play a crucial role in the \nimprovement of campus climate across the nation. However, documentation of the \neffectiveness and development of such programs is not extensive (Draughn, Elkins, & \nRoy, 2002). In this study, perceptions of the Safe Zone program, as they pertain to the \nparticular midsize, Midwestern university I chose to utilize, were examined via \ninterviews of first year resident assistants (RAs). I also examined contextual conditions \nas selected first year RAs implemented what they learned from the program to improve \nthe overall climate in the residence halls on campus. \nPurpose of the Study \nThe main purpose of this study was to analyze and assess the perceptions of the \nPhase 1 Safe Zone training at a midsize, Midwestern university among first year RAs in \nthe residence halls. In an exploratory study by Finkel, Storaasli, Bandele, & Schaefer \n(2003) the effectiveness of a Safe Zone training program within a graduate school of \nprofessional psychology was assessed. Its effectiveness was assessed by self-reported \nbehavioral and attitudinal changes and from participant evaluations. Training for \nparticipants surveyed in the Finkel et al. (2003) study was mandatory upon entrance into \nthe graduate program in psychology in the academic year 2000. Similarly, Safe Zone \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \ntraining is required for newly appointed RAs at the midsize, Midwestern university I \nchose to use for my study. \n4 \nAnother instrument used in the Finkel et al. (2003) study was the Riddle \nHomophobia Scale. This scale is currently used as part of the Phase 1 Safe Zone \ncurriculum at the midsize, Midwestern university I used for my study. The Riddle Scale \nmeasures the self-rated homophobic attitudes of participants towards LGBTQ \nindividuals. Between Phase 1 and Phase 2, in the Finkel et al. (2003) study, the \npercentage of participants within the negative range of the scale decreased significantly, \nand the percentage of participants within the positive range of the scale increased. It was \nconcluded that those who attended both Phase 1 and Phase 2 trainings were much more \nlikely to have achieved a greater level of acceptance and understanding of the LGBTQ \ncommunity. According to Poynter & Tubbs (2007), participating in a training or \nworkshop has the potential to provide a strong foundation for reaching acceptance and \nunderstanding of the LGBTQ population. However, ongoing educational opportunities \nshould be made available to help participants and potential allies better understand and \nprovide appropriate resources for LGBTQ individuals. These ongoing educational \nopportunities will, in tum, aid in helping said allies improve the campus climate in tenns \nof eradicating heterosexist thought and minimizing homophobic actions. \nSafe Zone Phase 2 training and other LGBTQA-related workshops are not \nrequired of first year RAs at the particular midsize, Midwestern university I chose to use \nfor my study. However, the study done by Finkel et al. (2003), and the findings of \nPoynter & Tubbs (2007), demonstrated the effect that Safe Zone training can have on \nparticipants. In Finkel's (2003) study, in particular, feedback on the Safe Zone training \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \nprogram was overwhelmingly positive and many of the participants indicated that they \nhad experienced a positive change in attitude and would recommend the program to a \ncolleague. \n5 \nThus, for the purpose of this study, I focused on first year RAs perceptions of \nPhase 1 Safe Zone training. However, I also attempted to ascertain how participants for \nthis study utilized the tools and information that they gained from the Phase 1 Safe Zone \ntraining to better the climate within their residence halls on campus. By examining the \ncontextual conditions in which these RAs implemented what they learned, we are able to \nunderstand their perceptions of the Phase 1 Safe Zone program. This study, in \nconcurrence with prior research, also allows student affairs professionals to better \nunderstand issues ofheteronormative thought, homophobia, and their connection to the \nneed for safe space initiatives, such as the Safe Zone Project, within higher education. \nAlthough the Finkel et al. (2003) study utilized both qualitative and quantitative \nmeasures, it lacked the depth of qualitative analysis. Through the use of triangulation, I \nutilized qualitative information gained from the Phase 1 Safe Zone training survey, as \nwell as information gained from one-on-one interviews with a purposive sample of first \nyear RAs, to validate the data collected. I also looked at whether or not first year RAs \nfelt as though they had an adequate amount of training to comfortably interact with \nLGBTQ students and implement programming that would better the residence hall \nenvironment for these gender and sexual minority students. \nResearch Questions \nThe following research questions were developed and were used to guide the \nstudy: \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \n1 . What are the perceptions of first year RAs as they are trained in the Phase 1 Safe \nZone program? \n2. What are the perceptions of first year RAs as they implement what they have \nlearned from the Phase One Safe Zone training in their residence halls? \nSignificance of the Study \n6 \nThis study is significant in the fact that there has been little qualitative analysis of \nSafe Zone training and perceptions of its implementation from the perspective of first \nyear RAs. According to Draughn et al. (2002), much of the documentation that exists \ngenerally focuses on case presentations of individual campus programs or steps that \nindividuals can take to become allies within the LGBTQ community. While this \ninformation is valuable to single programs and individuals, it fails to provide a more \ncomprehensive assessment of Safe Zone programs. Without examining how those \ntrained perceive the Safe Zone initiative, \"knowledge about the missions, objectives, \nprocesses, and outcomes of these programs remain restricted to that shared from \nindividual to individual, either anecdotally or through program presentation\" (Draughn et \nal., 2002, p. 12). This study provided themes that illuminated contextual conditions \nsurrounding perceptions of the Safe Zone program at the midsize, Midwestern university \nI chose to utilize. And the qualitative data collected may potentially be used for future \naccreditation purposes. \nLimitations of the Study \nThere are three main limitations of the study. The first limitation is that the study \nutilized data that is specific only to the university utilized. The procedures and \nmethodology of the study may, however, be transferrable to other institutions of similar \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \nsize and demographic. The second limitation of the study is that the sample used to \ncollect the data was purposive, consisting of only first year RAs on campus. And lastly, \ndue to the qualitative nature of the study, the number of participants utilized was small; \nthe participant pool was also not as diverse as it could have be. \nDefinition of Terms \n1. Safe Zone Project. \"A predominantly university-based diversity training \nprogram designed to increase awareness and knowledge of, and sensitivity to, \nimportant issues affecting LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff' (Finkel et al., \n2003). \n2. Safe Spaces. \"Small-scale settings within a community or movement that are \nremoved from the direct control of dominant groups, are voluntarily participated \nin ... [and are] spaces for like-minded people to meet and engage in dialogue\" \n(Fetner, Elafros, Bortolin, & Drechsler, 2012). \n3. Heterosexism. \"A belief that heterosexuality is the norm and/or superior to all \nother forms of sexuality, whereas other sexualities may be considered abnormal, \nunnatural, or not considered at all\" (Mule, Ross, Deeprose, Jackson, Daley, \nTravers, & Moore, 2009). \n4. Homophobia. Fear-based attitudes about, or actions against, LGBT individuals \n(Fanucce & Taub, 2010). \n7 \n5. Ally (A). \"A person who is a member of the dominant or majority group who \nworks to end oppression in his or her personal and professional life through \nsupport of, and as an advocate with and for, the oppressed population\" (Poynter & \nTubbs, 2007) \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \n6. Queer (Q). Designated by society as the \"other ... at odds with the normal, the \nlegitimate, the dominant\" (Toynton, 2006, p. 2). This otherness can be self-\ndeclared, externally imposed, or self-imposed . \n. 7. Preparedness. In terms of this study, preparedness is assessed based on how \n8 \nwell participants of Safe Zone training feel they were informed of LGBTQ-related \nissues and terminology and the degree to which first year RAs were able to \nimplement what they learned to create a more inclusive environment within the \nresidence halls on campus. \nSummary \nChapter one contained a detailed introduction to the study. In this section the \nsignificance and purpose of the study were discussed and a brief overview of some of the \nliterature was given. The study examined the perceptions of Phase 1 Safe Zone training \namong first year RAs. The study also discussed in what ways these RAs implemented \nwhat they learned in the Safe Zone training to create a more inclusive environment in the \nresidence halls on campus. Chapter two contains a detailed account of the literature that \nhas been developed in regards to the Safe Zone project and other safe space initiatives, as \nwell as the effect these programs can have when dealing with heterosexism and \nhomophobia. Chapter three then outlines the methods and procedures that were used in \nthe study. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \nChapter II \nReview of Literature \nThis chapter provides a detailed review ofliterature as it applies to the study. \nThis review includes an examination of perceived campus climate and the needs of \nLGBTQ individuals, the benefits and limitations of safe space initiatives, and \nheterosexism and homophobia on the college campus. Little research has been done on \nthe effectiveness of safe space initiatives. Thus, the following review ofliterature will \nstress the importance of such programs in a higher education setting, as well as the roles \nthat allies (such as RAs) play when trying to create a more inclusive environment for \nLGBTQ students. \nCampus Climate and the Needs of LGBTQ Individuals \n9 \nOne of the major topics addressed within the literature was campus climate and \nthe needs ofLGBTQ individuals on a college campus. Burleson (2010) studied \nprospective college students who are LGBTQ and what they look for when choosing a \ncollege. In the study, students were asked to rank a list of nine institutional factors in \norder of importance. The students surveyed rated attending a gay-friendly school fairly \nhigh on the list. In fact, sixty-seven percent ofrespondents rated attending a gay-friendly \ncampus as fairly or very important. While this factor was not considered to be the most \nimportant factor in deciding where to attend college, it demonstrates that the majority of \nprospective students in the study were looking for a welcoming and inclusive campus \nenvironment. These students wanted to attend an institution where there is a visible and \naccepted population of students like themselves. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 10 \nHaving programs such as Safe Zone, which is designed to increase awareness and \nknowledge of the important issues affecting LGBTQ individuals, on a college campus is \nvery important. According to Heck, Flentje, & Cochran (2013), making this type of \nprogram available has the potential to show prospective students that current students, \nfaculty, staff, and administration at the institution are accepting of the LGBTQ \ncommunity. According to Heck, et al., Safe Zone programs allow members of the \nLGBTQ community on campus to express their concerns without fear oflosing the \nsupport of peers, faculty, and administration. Not only does Safe Zone help to increase \nawareness of LGBTQ-related issues on campus, but it also helps LGBTQ individuals to \nidentify supportive peers, professors, and staff. Furthermore, programs like Safe Zone are \nshown to positively impact the academic achievement and experience of LGBTQ \nstudents (Heck et al., 2013). \nA study by Lewis, Derlega, Griffin, & Krowinski (2003) demonstrated how \nexperiences of stigma-related prejudice, discrimination, and victimization frequently \ncharacterize the lives of LGBTQ individuals. Such experiences have been linked to a \nrange of negative outcomes, including psychological distress. LGBTQ youth are \nespecially vulnerable to these negative outcomes, with many experiencing harassment \nand victimization in school, at home, at work, and in community settings (Lewis et al., \n2003). Research also indicates that the greater the young person's expectation for \nrejection by peers based on their sexual/gender identity, the more likely that individual is \nto report symptoms of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts (Kelleher, 2009). Safe \nspace programs, such as the Safe Zone Project, not only benefit LGBTQ individuals, but \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 11 \nalso help to inform allies of the struggles that these LGBTQ individuals go through on a \ndaily basis and give allies the tools to support the LGBTQ community on campus. \nIn a mixed-method study by Craig (2011 ), implementation of a community needs \nassessment (CNA) was conducted with the intent of creating a system of care for LGBTQ \nindividuals in an urban area. LGBTQ youth are considered a population at risk. Craig \nnoticed a lack of programs that target the specific needs of LGBTQ youth and realized \nthat there is a general lack of knowledge on such initiatives. For this reason, a \ncommunity needs assessment was implemented. Widespread CNA's for LGBTQ youth \nhave been limited in the past due to the challenges of obtaining funding for research and \nprogram development. However, the graduated CNA used in this particular study \nutilized both qualitative and quantitative approaches to elicit a significant amount of data \nabout LGBTQ youth needs and available resources. Craig determined that needs were \nnot being met by existing programs and that many of the needed programs didn't exist. \nThus, new programs were created to meet the needs of the LGBTQ youth in Miami Dade \nCounty, where this study took place (Craig 2011). The ultimate goal of the CNA \nconducted in Craig's study was to help create a possible model for a system that was \nrooted in the needs of LGBTQ youth. The implementation of the suggested model and its \nsuccess was not evaluated in this particular study. \nA study by Drumheller & McQuay (2010) also reported that not only is it difficult \nto develop outreach services to the LGBTQ population in conservative urban/rural \ncenters, but trying to market and raise funds adds another level of challenge. It is one \nthing for these organizations to exist; however, they cannot survive, much less thrive, \nwithout the necessary funding, something difficult in more conservative areas. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 12 \nDrumheller & McQuay's (2010) study focused on one particular outreach organization in \na conservative community and provided a case study of marketing challenges and \nrecommendations. Through the use of focus groups, it was discovered that the main \nproblem lies not with getting the necessary numbers for funding, but with getting possible \nfinancial backers to show up, donate, and commit to the cause. This apathy and the \nnature of the community where the study took place both impacted the pool of potential \ndonors to fund the necessary LGBTQ outreach services (Drumheller & McQuay, 2010). \nResearch conducted in Drumheller and McQuay's (2010) study suggested that the \nLGBTQ community is looking for a safe environment with resources that will help create \na clear identity for these outreach organizations. Creating a safe environment means \neducating the community-at-large in hopes of increasing tolerance. By expressing \ncommon ground and shared values, outreach centers and organizations can counteract the \napathy and lack of commitment that is seen in so many of these conservative geographic \nareas (Cheney & Christensen, 2001). \nAccording to Ciszek (2011 ), as a new generation of openly LGBTQ high school \nstudents arrive on college and university campuses, an increasing number of these \ninstitutions are seeking ways to serve and support this population of students in their \npersonal and educational endeavors. These initiatives might take the form of LGBTQ-\ninclusive policies and programs, changes to the curriculum, and adjustments in housing \nand student life to better serve this new and growing population. According to Ciszek, \nprint and online sources supporting LGBTQ issues and research have been found to be a \nvery important source of information for LGBTQ individuals. In fact, the collections and \nservices offered by academic libraries are often factored into research related to campus \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 13 \nclimate. In order for LGBTQ students' information and research needs to be met, and as \nthe population of LGBTQ students continues to grow, academic libraries must take \npositive steps to support and inform these students and their potential allies (Switzer, \n2008). \nEnhancement of heterosexual privilege is another issue found in the literature. \nThis is an issue for LGBTQ students at the collegiate level especially. Information is still \ncentered more on the needs of the heterosexual majority. Thus, there is a need for print \nand online sources that focus more on the needs of the gender and sexual minorities \npresent on campus (Schaller 2011 ). Schaller' s (2011) research alludes to the fact that \nthese sources are not only greatly needed for LGBTQ students, but for potential allies as \nwell. Sources that focus more on LGBTQ individuals will allow allies to learn more \nabout the LGBTQ community and the culture that surrounds it. They will also become \nbetter equipped to deal with LGBTQ-related issues they may encounter. \nBenefits and Limitations of Safe Space Initiatives \nThe majority of research conducted on safe space initiatives and the Safe Zone \nproject looks at the need for such programs and how they can influence the overall \nclimate and inclusivity of high schools and college campuses. For example, Alvarez & \nSchneider (2008) stated \"the inception of Project Safe Zone on any campus often comes \nfrom necessity\" (p. 71). The primary goal of this project is to train a group of individuals \nfrom various departments and offices on campus, or within a high school, to provide safe \nhavens for students, staff, or faculty if the need arises. This project is a way for a \nuniversity or school to show their support and commitment to inclusion and fostering a \nhealthy and open-minded campus community (Alvarez & Schneider, 2008). \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 14 \nIn several studies (Mayberry, 2006; Mayberry, Chenneville, and Currie, 2013; \nCurrie, Mayberry, and Chenneville, 2012), common themes emerged, such as the benefits \nand limitations to safe space initiatives in disrupting antigay school environments, silence \nfrom non-LGBTQ individuals, and school reform efforts. While all three studies look at \nsafe space initiatives associated with Gay Straight Alliance (GSAs) at the high school \nlevel, several of the findings can be used to analyze other safe space initiatives such as \nthe Safe Zone project. As stated by Mayberry et al. (2013), these GSAs \"contribute to \nthe school setting by offering LGBTQ students and their allies a sense of belonging to a \ncommunity, promoting self-understand and acceptance, and decreasing antigay behaviors \nand harassment within the school environment\" (p.312). Mayberry's (2006) study \nreported that LGBTQ students who attend schools with GSAs and other safe space \ninitiatives feel less isolated, exhibit a greater willingness to be involved in school and \ncommunity activities, experience more positive relationships with peers and staff, and are \nmore motivated academically. \nWhile the benefits of these safe space programs are clear, discourse on said \nprograms is built on the assumption that LGBTQ individuals and their allies need to be \nprotected from a hostile school environment. And, as such, the heteronormative school \nclimate that makes these initiatives necessary is glanced over (Currie et al., 2012). This \nlimitation is more applicable in terms of high school GS As where activities educating the \nschool community on issues ofheterosexism and homophobia are greatly regulated. \nHowever, when it comes to the Safe Zone project at the college and university level, \nthese topics can be talked about more freely due to regulations of such topics being less \nstrict at the collegiate level. Currie, et al. (2012) argue that in many safe space initiatives, \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 15 \nLGBTQ youth are unintentionally framed as the problem, an at-risk population. Currie, \net al. (2012) discuss the importance of how LGBTQ youth are framed, and how, in order \nto combat heteronomrative thought and homophobia, it is necessary to draw attention to \nsuch issues and look at ways in which to reform school policy. \nA theme that emerged within the literature was silence. Silence is another reason \nwhy thoughts ofheteronormativity and homophobia are still perpetuated today. The \npersistence of these antigay attitudes in schools emphasizes the importance of \nrecognizing the benefits and limitations of these safe space initiatives/strategic \ninterventions. As Mayberry (2006) stated, \"violence, bias, and harassment directed at \nLGBTQ students continue to be the rule-not the exception-in America's schools\" (p. \n262). And, silence is a primary contributor to these issues. So, while safe space \nschooling practices do offer support to LGBTQ students, they do not address this issue of \nsilence and the mechanisms behind this particular population's marginalization. Both \nMayberry (2006) and Mayberry, et al. (2013) suggest systemic change is needed to \ncombat these problems: \"Systemic change involves efforts to transform antigay school \ncultures by addressing social justice and equity issues throughout the 'entire ecosystem of \nthe school' and its surrounding community\" (Mayberry, 2006, p. 263). This is further \nenforced by Rankin's (2005) study, which proposes that a culture of silence reinforces the \nnorm, and that to truly transform a college campus LGBTQ students must have increased \nvisibility. Systemic interventions and increased visibility have a long-lasting effect and \nremain a part of the culture, even as administrators, staff, and students circulate in and out \nof a particular school. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 16 \nHeterosexism and Homophobia on Campus \nOne of the most important ways of com batting heterosexism and homophobia on \na college campus is to increase visibility of the LGBTQ population by having open \ndiscussions via LGBTQ panel presentations and Safe Zone trainings. According to Fox \nand Ore (2010), \"Safe space initiatives aim to raise visibility and create educational \nprograms for LGBTQ students that increase awareness of LGBTQ issues and address the \npresence of heterosexism and homophobia in campus culture\" (p. 630). Fox & Ore \n(2010) recognized the value of these safe space programs, as they have been central to \nchanging the campus climate for LGBTQ individuals for a few decades now. However, \nFox & Ore argue that safe space initiatives are limited because these programs have been \nconceptualized to focus on eradicating heterosexism and homophobia. They state that \n\"the problem with the discourse of safe space [is that] it has been decided that the social \nproblem for LGBT people is relatively easy to identify-homophobia and heterosexism\" \n(Fox & Ore, 2010, p. 632). Thus, on the surface, these spaces create a welcoming \nenvironment for all LGBTQ individuals and their allies, and yet when one takes a closer \nlook, they obscure other oppressions or privileges that heterosexual individuals have. \nThe focus on heterosexism and homophobia inadvertently \"constructs 'gayness' as a \nprimary identity and other identities as peripheral or marginal ... this discourse further \nsuggests that all gay people experience homophobia and heterosexism in similar ways\" \n(Fox & Ore, 2010, p. 632). So, while these safe spaces have the potential to establish a \ncertain solidarity that allows LGBTQ individuals to flourish in the context of a larger \nuniversity, the concept of safety around which queer activism is organized must be \nquestioned and challenged. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 17 \nMacintosh (2007) discussed a session with one of her teacher education classes in \nwhich a young man studying to be a math teacher stated that he was \"just a math teacher\" \n(p.35) after a lecture Macintosh gave on heterosexism. This incident illustrates the \nreasoning behind Safe Zone programs and other safe space initiatives. As previously \nstated, we do need to reframe how we view the idea of safety and how these \nprograms/initiatives are organized. However, this lecture on heterosexism was a \nfundamental level of intervention taken on by Macintosh, and this particular pre-service \nteacher was stuck in a train of thought where he believed math classrooms were exempt \nfrom LGBTQ-related social issues. This pre-service teacher, according to Macintosh, \nwas not aware that his thought process was further perpetuating the invisibility of \nLGBTQ individuals and the issues that they face. \nMacintosh saw an opportunity to educate her students within the classroom and \nthrough the study that she conducted. Much like a classroom, residence halls are a great \nplace to educate students and profoundly affect their college experience in a positive \nway: \"Given what an important educational impact residential living can have on \nstudents, it is important to understand how [LGBT] students fit into on-campus living \nsettings and how they are influenced by the residential environment\" (Fanucce &Taub \n2010). In a campus climate survey conducted by Rankin (2003), 36% of LGBTQ \nrespondents had experienced harassment within the past year, 20% feared for their \nphysical safety, and 51 % reported concealing their sexual orientation for fear of physical \nharm. \nRankin (2005) noted that the challenges and threats faced by LGBTQ college \nstudents can \"prevent them from reaching their full academic potential or from \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 18 \nparticipating fully in campus communities\" (p. 17). While more campuses are \nundertaking the task of creating more proactive programs to protect and provide support \nfor LGBTQ students, many members of this population still fear for their safety on \ncampuses across the nation. Thus, as a result, these individuals may remain closeted and \nless engaged in their college experience. According to Holland, Matthews, & Schott \n(2013 ), it is important to address homophobia on college campuses because college \nstudents often \"come out\" to peers, mentors, and family during the college years. \nStudents want to feel as though the environment they are in is safe and inclusive enough \nto where they will not be ostracized or harassed for being LGBTQ. However, \"climate \ncannot change quickly\" (Lipka, 2011, p. 8). As gathered from a majority of the literature, \nthe only way to truly create that safe and inclusive environment is to increase visibility, \nopen up dialogue on these issues, and give it time. \nIn a study by Fanucce & Taub (2010), analysis of the data collected revealed that \nas levels ofheterosexism and homonegativity increased, LGBTQ students' perceptions of \nthe residence hall climate became more negative. Homonegativity can affect everyone \nwithin the residence halls by creating layers of heterosexual privilege for non-LGBTQ \nindividuals, inhibiting close relationships with members of the same sex, and \ncompromising the integrity of individuals who are heterosexual, thus resulting in \ntargeting, badgering, intimidating, and sometimes silencing those who are perceived to be \nLGBTQ (but may not be). Such behavior prevents the development of authentic self-\nidentity for some LGBTQ individuals (Fanucce & Taub, 2010). Because heterosexism \nand acts ofhomonegativity can have such a major impact on LGBTQ students' \nperceptions of residence hall climate, Safe Zone training and other diversity trainings are \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 19 \nusually strongly encouraged for RAs. These trainings give RAs the necessary tools for \neducating students in their halls about LGBTQ-related issues, and the effects of \nheterosexism and homonegativity can be developed and discussed. Using the resources \nand skills provided by Safe Zone training, RAs can better help LGBTQ students navigate \nthe college experience (Fanucce & Taub 2010). \nAlthough programs such as Safe Zone provide for much needed open discourse \nabout certain LGBTQ issues, there are several other ways of combatting homophobia and \nheterosexism on college campuses. One example would be for professors to bring \nLGBTQ speakers and panels into their classrooms. These panels and speakers could also \nbe utilized within various offices, departments, and residence halls across campus. Lance \n(2002), Lance (2008), and Rye & Meaney (2009) addressed this method of social contact \ntheory, or the \"contact hypothesis,\" in their studies. Within this theory, greater contact \nwith an unfavorable minority group is proposed as a way of reducing prejudices and fears \nby showing that myths, stereotypes, and fears are unfounded. However, this social \ncontact can generate negative results if it is not organized to meet certain optimal \nconditions (Lance, 2002). According to Rye & Meaney (2009), these optimal conditions \ninclude \"cooperation among disparate groups, [the] pursuit of common goals, interaction \nas peers, egalitarian social norms, and [an] opportunity for emotional involvement\" (p. \n32). \nWhile the contact between heterosexual students and LGBTQ individuals found \nin many Safe Zone trainings and panel discussions is brief and not sufficient enough for \nthe development of a friendship, it may create the positive emotional attachment that is \nrequired by the contact hypothesis (Rye & Meaney, 2009). According to a meta-analysis \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 20 \nby Pettigrew and Tropp (2000), contact with a variety of unfavorable minorities was \neffective in creating positive attitude change towards those groups, especially when the \ncontact was face-to-face. Exactly how this emotional involvement and \ninteraction/cooperation as peers may change individuals' attitudes is addressed by \nEpstein's (1994) cognitive-experiential theory of self. The theory proposes two types of \nlearning: rational and experiential. The experiential system is more affectively, or \nemotionally, driven, and is more involved in making real-life decisions. According to \nRye & Meaney (2009), \"people often make decisions based on affective reactions ... from \npast experiences rather than rational analysis ... situations that emphasize emotional \ninvolvement, then, may lead to attitude change by activating the experiential system of \nlearning\" (p. 33). Thus, it is safe to say that contact with members of unfavorable \nminority groups changes attitudes by activating the experiential learning system. \nSummary \nIn this chapter a detailed review of the literature as it applies to the study was \nprovided. The central issues of campus climate and the needs of LGBTQ students, \nbenefits and limitations of safe space initiatives, and heterosexism and homophobia were \naddressed. These issues were evaluated in terms of the utilization of effective \nprogramming, such as the Safe Zone Project and social contact theory. The review of \nliterature also demonstrated ways in which RAs can become better allies and create a \nmore inclusive environment in the residence halls. By using what they have learned from \nSafe Zone training and other LGBTQ-related resources, RAs are better equipped to \nhandle issues ofheterosexism and homophobia and to educate their peers on LGBTQ-\nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 21 \nrelated issues. Residence halls are a community and a place where RAs have a chance to \nmake a major impact. Roper (2005) said it best when he stated: \nOur leadership must be evidenced by support structures that can be seen, touched, \nand sensed by LGBT students. As community builders we must use the influence \nof our roles to remove obstacles, lessen challenges, interrupt threats, and dispel \nmyths that restrict opportunities for success for LGBT students. Although \ncommunity building is not advocacy, it is active ally work-we do not speak for \nLGBT students; instead we lead in ways that validate the words they speak and \nsupport the needs they express. As active allies we work to act on the needs of \nLGBT students. (p. 87) \nThis quote is the essence of what the Safe Zone program tries to demonstrate to \nparticipants, and really sums up how gaining more knowledge on the LGBTQ community \nand LGBTQ-related issues can help RAs build a more open and inclusive community \nwithin the residence halls. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \nChapter III \nMethodology \n22 \nThis chapter outlines the methodological framework that was used to conduct the \nstudy. This methodological framework allowed for a contextual analysis of first year \nRAs' perceptions of the Phase 1 Safe Zone program and in what ways it prepared \nparticipants to help and support those of the LGBTQ community. I also looked at how \nthe selected first year RAs utilized the knowledge gained from the training to create a \nmore inclusive environment in the residence halls on campus. \nDesign of the Study \nTo examine perceptions of how well the Phase 1 Safe Zone program prepares \nparticipants to affect change within the residence halls, a qualitative approach was \nutilized. In the fall of 2014, four first year RAs were interviewed one-on-one after they \nhad completed the mandatory Phase 1 Safe Zone training. I conducted two sets of \ninterviews with the RAs selected, one within the first few weeks of the semester, and \nanother a few months later to see how they had utilized the information from the training \nto help the overall environment in the residence halls. This qualitative approach provided \nme with a more contextual view of my research and allowed me to understand whether or \nnot the RAs in my purposive sample felt better equipped to handle situations involving \nLGBTQ individuals after taking the training. In order to further validate the information \ncollected from these interviews, I triangulated the data by looking at the answers that the \nfour participants gave on the evaluation forms they filled out at the end of the Safe Zone \ntraining. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 23 \nParticipants \nAll first year RAs are required to complete Phase 1 Safe Zone training as part of \ntheir preparation for working in the residence halls. This mandatory training occurs \nevery August before the start of the academic school year. Filling out an evaluation is \nmandatory upon completion of any Safe Zone training. As such, all first year RAs were \nasked to complete the Phase 1 evaluation. \nFour first year RAs constituted the sample used in the study. Because of the \npurpose and significance of the study, the sample was categorized as purposive. The \nselected RAs were within the ages of 18-23 years old, all Caucasian, and all from various \nacademic disciplines. One of the participants was male and three were female, all from \neither rural or suburban areas within Illinois. Four of the eleven residence halls on \ncampus were represented by the selected first year RAs. \nResearch Site \nThe study took place at a predominantly White, mid-sized (9,000 students) \ncomprehensive, teaching institution in a rural, Midwestern town. Evaluation forms were \nfilled out by hand (pencil and paper) immediately after completion of the Phase 1 Safe \nZone training. The training took place in a classroom on campus, which is also where the \nevaluations were administered. The interview pmiion of the study was conducted in the \nLGBTQA Resource Center a few weeks after the training took place, as well as a few \nmonths into the fall semester. Participants were notified, prior to completing the \nevaluation, that there would be an interview component to this study and that a select \nnumber of first year RAs would be chosen to create a purposive sample. Safe Zone \ntrainers were instructed to inform all first year RAs that they were not required to \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 24 \nparticipate in this study. If they decided it was something they were interested in helping \nout with, they were then asked to read and sign a consent form that would allow them to \nparticipate. Participants were also made aware of when and where interviews would be \ncompleted. \nInstrument \nThe research study consisted of three separate components: the evaluation, first \ninterview, and second interview. The data gathered from the initial evaluation forms \nallowed me to examine the selected first year RAs perceptions of how preparatory the \nSafe Zone program is, whereas the two interviews allowed me to code and examine \nthemes that emerged as the selected first year RAs dealt with issues of diversity and \nstudents who identify as LGBTQ. \nData Collection \nData from the evaluation forms was collected immediately following the Phase 1 \nSafe Zone training in August. The first set of interviews with the selected four first year \nRAs occurred one month after the training was completed. Then, halfway through the \n2014 fall semester, towards the beginning of November, these RAs were contacted and \nscheduled for a second interview. During this second interview, the implementation of \nwhat these first year RAs had learned from the training was examined. \nTreatment of Data \nAfter the two interview components of the study were completed, the data was \nthen transcribed and coded. In order to help identify any themes among participants, \nanswers from the Phase 1 Safe Zone training evaluation were also coded and utilized in \nthe analysis of the data. Examining perceptions of the Phase 1 Safe Zone training has \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 25 \nallowed for a better understanding of whether or not participants felt as though they were \nbeing provided with enough information that would prepare them to handle situations \npertaining to LGBTQ individuals on campus (in this case, in the residence halls). \nData Analysis \nTo gain access to my study sample, I attended the Phase 1 Safe Zone training for \nfirst year RAs on campus in August 2014. I also remained in contact with the selected \nfirst year RAs throughout the course of the fall semester of 2014 by way of two interview \nphases. Analysis of the data collected occurred after both the evaluation and interview \nphases had been completed. Through the use of transcription and coding, I was able to \nsee how the perceptions of the selected first year RAs differed, as well as how they were \nsimilar. This is important, as it has given me greater insight into how well Safe Zone \nfacilitators are preparing participants to know how to address issues that may arise with \nLGBTQ students on campus. \nAccording to Yin (2010), most qualitative analysis appears to follow a general, \nfive-phased cycle: compiling, disassembling, reassembling (and arraying), interpreting, \nand concluding. Yin also stated that it is possible to go back and forth between phases \nwithin this cycle. Thus, analysis may not necessarily be linear in fashion. Following this \ncycle, I first compiled all of the interview transcriptions into working order. Next, I \ndisassembled and coded the data that I collected, breaking up each transcription into \nfragments or pieces that were then analyzed. Based on the themes that emerged from the \ncoding/disassembling phase of my data, I then reassembled the fragments or pieces of my \ntranscriptions into different groupings/lists as a way to reorganize my findings. Once the \ndata I collected was reassembled, I then interpreted the significance of these new \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 26 \ngroupings (Chapter IV). Lastly, I drew conclusions from all of the data that I had \ncollected and made connections back to the other four phases of the cycle. In this \nconclusion phase (Chapter V), I used the reassembled/newly-interpreted data to support \nmy claims that the Phase 1 Safe Zone training is accomplishing the goals that it purports. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \nChapter IV \nFindings \n27 \nThe primary purpose of this study was to analyze the perceptions of the Phase 1 \nSafe Zone training at a midsize, Midwestern university among first year RAs in the \nresidence halls. A secondary purpose was to examine how first year RAs perceive their \nability to use training material to interact with LGBTQ students and implement \nprogramming within the context of the residence hall environment. This chapter presents \nemergent themes related to the two research questions that aided in the purpose of this \nstudy. These themes emerged through the analysis of Safe Zone Phase 1 evaluations as \nwell as two sets of interviews conducted with four first year RAs at the institution. The \nparticipants all had various levels of previous exposure to the LGBTQ community and \nspanned a variety of academic disciplines and residence halls on campus. The research \nquestions for this study are presented with themes that emerged from the analysis. \nResearch Question 1: What are the perceptions of first year RAs as they are trained \nin the Phase 1 Safe Zone program? \nImpact of Training \nFirst year RAs interviewed for this study all had varying levels of exposure to the \nLGBTQ community and shared their thoughts on the impact of the Safe Zone Phase 1 \ntraining, resulting in the emergence of the study's first theme. The following sub-themes \nwill illuminate participants' perceptions of the training and how those perceptions impact \ntheir views of the LGBTQ community. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 28 \nPrevious exposure. \nOne thing that all four participants had in common was previous exposure to the \nLGBTQ community. For Daniel, Kate, and Ada this level of exposure was relatively \nhigh, as they all came from large high schools in more suburban areas. Ada alluded to \nthe fact that the size of her high school, as well as her extracurricular involvement, had a \nstrong impact on her level of exposure to the LGBTQ community: \nIt was a very open school. There were quite a few gay individuals, as well as \npeople from all different races and ethnicities. It wasn't one of those high schools \nwhere you come from a small graduating class that has no variety whatsoever. \nMy graduating class size was close to 600 students. And I had a few friends who \nidentified as LGBTQ. I was also in the drama club, so there were lots ofLGBTQ \nstudents, and I was really good friends with them. So, interacting with that \npopulation is nothing new whatsoever. I am definitely used to being in that \nenvironment. \nSimilarly, Kate cited her extracurricular involvement with the dance team and fashion \nclub as having an impact on her exposure to the LGBTQ community. She also discussed \nhow her high school was very open when it came to students of ethnic, racial, gender, and \nsexual minorities: \nI knew people who identified as LGBTQ, and as far as I know there were never \nany major issues that they faced. At some schools you talk to people and you \nhear how they had students who committed suicide, who were constantly harassed \nand bullied, and other instances like that. Fortunately, we did not have anything \nlike that occur. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \nWhile Daniel went to a Catholic high school, he also discussed having a very positive \nexperience: \"It was pretty accepting, I would say. I came out to friends and family my \nsenior year and I didn't really encounter any problems. They didn't have any sort of \nPride group at my school, or anything like that. However, I believe most people were \npretty cool about it.\" \n29 \nBecca's previous exposure to the LGBTQ community was not as high in relation \nto the other three participants. This difference in exposure was clear when she discussed \nthe school and town environment that she grew up in: \nGrowing up I knew about the LGBTQ community, but I had experiences where \nparents didn't inform their kids about gay people. We also didn't have any \nopenly gay kids in school since it was really small. My parents never hid \nanything from me per se; however, my mom and my stepdad aren't really \naccepting of that lifestyle. Despite their personal opinions, they never tried to \nskew how I felt, which I am appreciative of. \nTraining style and outcomes. \nMany of the participants found the Safe Zone training informative; it allowed \nthem to feel more comfortable when dealing with LGBTQ-related issues and the LGBTQ \ncommunity. In talking about the training, as a whole, Kate stated: \"It was really well \nrounded. Instead of focusing on just one thing, you were immersed in a lot of various \ntopics related to the LGTBQ community. So, it was kind of nice that we were able to get \nthat background and be able to apply it. We were then able to take that information with \nus and do whatever we needed to do with it.\" She reinforced her point by stating: \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 30 \nI really liked how the Safe Zone training wasn't forceful. The trainers mentioned \nthat they understood how every individual is going to have their own opinions and \nbeliefs, that everyone is at a different stage, and that they weren't there to force \nthe information down our throats. They came at things from more of a place of \nunderstanding, helping to educate people and inform them. You had a choice. \nYou were able to take a sticker and sign a statement of intent, or you could choose \nnot to. That was up to you. However, they did stress how it was important not to \nput up a sticker and say you're available as a safe space for those students when \nyou're really not. So, I thought that that was excellent. It made us all feel pretty \nrelaxed and at ease. \nAda further supported Kate's claims by stating: \"It wasn't shoving information down \nyour throat. They really wanted us to feel comfortable with the subject matter, and if you \ndidn't agree with the information you didn't have to sign the intent form. You don't have \nto do things this way or that. We just want you to be informed in your decisions. So, that \nwas nice.\" \nDuring discussions, Becca mentioned how the training allowed her to be more \nintentional in how she addressed certain situations when dealing with residents in her \nhall: \nI make it a goal to try not to make those situations feel more awkward and try to \nuse more inclusive language. I had one resident who asked if I had to say things \nlike that. And I said no I don't have to, but I don't want to not say it and assume \neveryone is attracted to the opposite sex when that may not be the case. And in \nmy programming it is very much the same, making sure that I am sticking with \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 31 \nthe correct terminology. Because someone may choose to come out to me in my \ntime as an RA, and I want to make sure that I have done everything that I can in \norder to make sure that they are comfortable enough to come and talk to me, or to \nfeel that way on our floor. \nBeing a part of the LGBTQ community himself, Daniel offered up a unique \nperspective in terms of the Safe Zone training and his feelings about the educational \nvalue of the curriculum utilized within the session: \nI thought that the training was really good, and extremely helpful, especially for \nthose who aren't that familiar with issues related to the LGBTQ community. For \nexample, the LGBTQ Terminology worksheet that we did, I knew all of those \nterms and had been exposed to them before. However, I am positive that there \nwere a lot of people who had never been exposed to some of them. So, in that \nrespect, I think it was very educational and eye opening for some individuals. It \ngot you to come to certain realizations, like when we talked about facts vs. myths \nwithin the community. So, again, overall it was very informative and helpful. \nAwareness of privilege and advocacy. \nAll four participants expressed how the Safe Zone training encouraged them to \nthink about the impact of heterosexual privilege on LGBTQ individuals and how they can \nbe better allies and advocates for the LGBTQ community. In terms of heterosexual \nprivilege, Ada stated: \nIt sucks to admit it, but I do have certain privileges just because I identify as a \nheterosexual female. I hate admitting that, but it's the truth, especially in certain \nsettings. Ifl were a part of the LGBTQ community I would feel like I am missing \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 32 \nout on certain opportunities that those who are heterosexual take for granted. \nMost people don't even notice or think about those privileges. And going through \nthe training forces you to become more aware of those things. I will admit that, \nbefore the training, I didn't even think about those privileges that I possess \nbecause I'm straight. And now it's sort of upsetting to think that for a lot of \npeople it doesn't even cross their minds once. That's where the power of the Safe \nZone training lies, in knowing what you should be grateful for and what things \nyou didn't even think about. \nBecca reinforced Ada's statement when she discussed how her newfound awareness from \nthe training has helped her become a better advocate for residents on her floor: \nI don't think that anyone should be privileged based on his or her sexual \norientation. I feel like we should all be on the same level, that it should be an \neven playing field. It definitely makes me feel more aware. Holding hands with \nmy boyfriend, walking down the street, I'm not going to get weird looks. But if \ntwo girls were to do the same thing they might get weird looks and someone \nmight even say something to them. Even just being aware of what people say and \nhow they talk can be extremely important. I know some people don't think about \nthe way that they say things. However, with my floor I try to get them to change \ntheir language and be more conscientious. I think that it's important to be aware \nof the privilege I possess, but to also realize that I can combat those privileges and \nhelp the LGBTQ community. And ifl'm not doing so, then I'm not doing my \njob. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 33 \nAda, Kate, and Becca touched on the fact that the training was a transformative \nexperience that forced them to become more aware of the privileges they possess and \nhow they can better advocate for the LGBTQ community, as demonstrated above. Becca \nput it best when she stated: \nBefore, I was supportive of the LGBTQ community, and just said, 'Oh, yeah. \nThat's cool. I don't care what you do in your personal life, you can love whoever \nyou want.' But now, I feel this sense of wanting, to step up and educate others. \nI've always been one of those people who, if someone says something negative \nabout the community, would say, 'Excuse me. That's not okay.' Basically, I \nwould chop their head off. But now, I think more about educating people instead \nof barking at them or getting into it with them. I just don't think everyone is as \neducated, especially depending on where you come from or what your family \nupbringing is. So, I think that the best thing we can do as allies is advocate and \neducate others. \nDuring our discussion, Kate mentioned how she was planning to do a bulletin board \nabout tolerance and acceptance of the LGBTQ community prior to going through the \nSafe Zone training. After the training, however, she realized that there is still quite a \nways to go after reaching that acceptance stage: \nI was coming from a place of acceptance before, not just tolerance, which was \ngood. I just didn't realize that there was more I could do past that point. So, it \nwas motivating for me to make the realization that I could move towards \ncelebrating the LGBTQ community. I want to do better. I want to help others \nrealize that it's not just about tolerating or accepting members of the LGBTQ \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 34 \ncommunity. It's about celebrating all that they have to offer, who they are as \npeople. I really care about members of the LGBTQ community, and believe that \nthey deserve to be proud of who they are. Talking about the Riddle Homophobia \nScale helped me to put things into perspective. I was able to see where I was at, \nand realized the level I wanted to reach. \nAda also discussed active ways of engaging with the LGBTQ community and displaying \nto others that you are an advocate: \nMy thought process changed after the training. You can believe in equal rights \nand equality, or you can actually act on it and show you're a supporter of the \nLGBTQ community and that you believe in the cause. So, that entails going to \ndifferent LGBTQ-related events, stopping by Pride, showing off your buttons and \nSafe Zone sticker, and not just being passive about it. \nWhile Daniel, who identifies as part of the LGBTQ community, was unable to think of an \ninstance where heterosexual privilege has impacted him personally, he did believe the \ndiscussion of heterosexual privilege and advocacy to be an important one: \nI can't really think of an instance where it's impacted me. However, I think that \nthat has a lot to do with the fact that we are so used to living in a society where \nthat's the norm. That's why I liked the heterosexual privilege activity. Because \nthere were some things that even I had never really thought about. Coming to that \nrealization was important and definitely helpful to talk about. Fortunately, I have \nnever felt like I have been in a situation like that on campus. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 35 \nSeeing the bigger picture. \nUpon reflection, Kate expressed how the Safe Zone training allowed her and her \nfellow RAs the opportunity to put themselves in the shoes of someone who identifies as \nLGBTQ: \nI really liked how interactive the training was, because it got you to put yourself \nin the place of someone who is part of that community. I can say that I \nunderstand where they are coming from, but really I don't know because I haven't \nlived it. I would love to be able to understand that, but it's hard. I don't want to \nnecessarily relate it to my own experiences and belittle what they have gone \nthrough. \nWhile discussing the coming out process, Becca expressed her realization that not \neveryone's coming out process is the same, that some people are exiled from their friends \nand family. She also expressed how there are individuals who are fully accepted by their \nfriends and family, as well as those who fall somewhere in between. Walking through \nthe coming out process allowed Becca to understand what LGBTQ individuals go \nthrough on an emotional level: \nI feel like it would be incredibly stressful and scary to go through that process, not \nto mention frustrating. I would be worried because, while more and more people \nare becoming accepting of the LGBTQ community, there are still people out there \nwho are very hateful towards those individuals. I can imagine being afraid of \nbeing in your own skin, not knowing whether or not you should express your true \nself. But I think that those individuals who say, 'Hey! This is who I am,' and are \nunapologetic about it, are extremely courageous. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 36 \nKate was also attuned to the emotional turmoil that LGBTQ individuals may go through \nwhile they are still discovering who they are: \nI can't even imagine what it would be like to have to pretend to be someone I'm \nnot 24 hours a day. I mean that's awful. Going to class, going out, just \neverything ... and it affects you everywhere. It's great that there are safe spaces on \ncampus because it allows those individuals safe places to go if they are having \ntrouble. But that can't be said for everywhere. You never know what you could \nbe walking into, wherever you go. You don't know who is going to be there or \nwhat they are capable of doing. I would be extremely sad if others were to bash \nor bully me for simply being who I am. I would hate that. Being LGBTQ is part \nof who you are, but it isn't all that you are. And you should take pride in who you \nare, not hide it away where no one can see the real you. And the fact that \nsometimes those individuals don't feel as though they can have that sense of pride \nis hard to swallow. \nPreparedness. \nThe Safe Zone program seeks to prepare participants to interact and work with the \nLGBTQ community and to provide participants with the necessary resources to help \nmembers of that community, should they need them. Throughout my discussions with \nthe participants, this feeling of preparedness was something that kept emerging. Ada \nstated: \nI would like to believe that I am more prepared after the training. If a student \ncame to me with any problems or questions, I now have resources on hand which \nI can utilize. So, if I'm not able to answer something, I at least have those \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 37 \nresources along with the online resources mentioned during the training. I know \nexactly where my handouts are, and they are easily accessible. \nDaniel expressed his appreciation for the institution's Safe Zone program and discussed \nhis thoughts on the real world applications of the training: \nI thought that the training was helpful in terms of situations that RAs may have to \nhandle on the job. For instance, if a student comes out to you, or, if you have a \nstudent who identifies as LGBTQ on your floor, how do you include them and \nmake them feel comfortable. You begin to understand how that all looks and how \nyou should, and shouldn't, act in that type of situation. You also realize some of \nthe difficulties those students may encounter on a social, academic, and emotional \nlevel. I don't think a lot of people really know how they are supposed to act and \nwhat they are supposed to do. The scenario application part of the training spoke \nto things that could actually happen, so I thought it was good that it was included. \nKate's thoughts on the scenarios only further supported Daniel's claims: \"It might be a \ncompletely different scenario than the ones we went over in the training. But, at least you \nhave some common knowledge and background of how you would want to be treated in \nthat situation. So, you are able to put yourself in those students' shoes.\" Becca also felt \nas though the application-based scenarios from the training were helpful: \"It \ndemonstrated that there are always multiple ways of handling certain situations. And I \nthink that it was nice preparation if any of us actually encounter a similar scenario in the \nresidence halls.\" \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 38 \nResearch Question 2: What are the perceptions of first year RAs as they implement \nwhat they have learned, from the Phase 1 Safe Zone program, in their residence \nhalls? \nContext of Implementation \nThe second theme that emerged centered around the participants' perceptions of \nthe programming they implemented as a way of bettering the residence hall environment \nfor students who identify as LGBTQ. Throughout the interviews, several sub-themes \nemerged which helped to create a much clearer picture of the context in which these \nvarious programming attempts took place. \nSuccess with programming. \nBoth Daniel and Ada expressed that the active programming they did elicited a \nlackluster response. However, both also mentioned how they usually do not have a very \ngood turnout for floor events. Both participants work mainly with upperclassmen, which \nthey opined might be part of the problem. Ada felt somewhat discouraged by such a low \nturnout at the diversity event she held, and stated: \"I don't have the greatest attendance \nand I think that it's because I do have more upperclassmen than some of the other RAs. \nAnd not as many freshmen who are willing to go out of their way and meet new people.\" \nDue to the low turnout, the residents who were in attendance felt awkward speaking and \nreally engaging with others because the group was so small. When it came to the \ndiversity program that Daniel held for his residents, he mentioned how he tried to get \nthem to engage in conversation, but it just didn't seem to work: \nI don't know. I feel like I was talking at them kind of. I tried to get them to have \nconversation about the cross the line activity that we did, but they didn't seem to \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 39 \nwant to have one. Despite people not really talking a whole lot, they still seemed \nto enjoy the program. I did an icebreaker called, 'What Makes You Special,' \nbefore that, which allowed us to have a discussion about how we all have our \nstrengths and weaknesses, the things that make us different and we are proud of. \nAnd my residents were a bit more engaged during that activity. \nDaniel and Ada relayed greater success with more passive programming, such as putting \nup bulletin boards on LGBTQ-related topics in their halls. Daniel stated: \nI had a bulletin board for LGBTQA History Month. It was really cool. I printed \nout a bunch of info graphics, and had the calendar of events up, as well as some \nparts of the Alphabet Soup Bulletin Board-to-Go from the LGBTQA Web Center. \nSome people said that they liked it a lot. And others said that it was very \ninformative. \nKate further reinforced the success of more passive programming as she reflected on her \nexperience with posting a bulletin board in her hall: \"I also did an LGBTQA History \nMonth bulletin board and things like that. It was kind of cool because some of my \nresidents walked by and were like, 'Hey, Kate is doing this for us!' So, I thought that it \nwas really nice to be able to put that out there and to have them appreciate the gesture.\" \nKate, unlike the other participants, also seemed to have a more positive \nexperience with the active programming that she implemented and had relatively good \nturnout due to the demographic of the floor that she works with: \nWe did an activity where I wrote on butcher block various groups/communities of \npeople, and had my residents go through and think of stereotypes, both good and \nbad, that are commonly associated with those groups of people. I know for the \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 40 \nLGBTQ community some of the things they wrote were positive, and some were \nnegative. But, that was how most were across the board. It was really interesting \nfor me to sit there and read what they had to say. I got pretty good feedback from \nthem, which I thought was pretty nice. And they seemed to enjoy the activity. It \nallowed us to have a very open discussion about why some of the stereotypes they \nwrote down are bad and how we can help to combat them. \nCreating awareness. \nAll of the participants emphasized the importance of educating their residents in \nterms of LGBTQ-related issues. Becca expressed a desire to bring these issues to the \nforefront: \nI feel like when people think diversity, the LGBTQ community is sometimes left \nby the wayside. That's not a group that most people immediately think of as \ndiverse. People think more about socio-economic status, the color of one's skin, \nthose types of things that we have been taught to think of as diversity. So, I \nwould love to put more emphasis on LGBTQ issues. \nShe further expressed a want to make her residents think twice about the way that they \nsay or address certain things: \nI think just stopping people when they say negative things can be a big deal, \nbecause then maybe they'll think twice the next time around. I know a lot of \npeople say the phrase, 'Oh, that's so gay.' But they could use a different word, \none that actually is used correctly. And so I think just stopping them and letting \nthem know, 'Hey, that's not okay to say' is important. It forces them to think \nabout the individuals that those words may hurt. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 41 \nKate further supported this idea when she discussed meeting students where they are at, \nrather than reprimanding them for their lack of knowledge when it comes to the LGBTQ \ncommunity: \nObviously, if I hear comments or things like that I'm not going to let that be \ntolerated, especially not on my floor. However, I try not to necessarily yell or \nreprimand people, but help them understand. Everyone has different backgrounds \nand the most important thing I think we can do as RAs is to bring awareness to \nthe resident who may have made a poor comment or acted a certain way. I try to \nget them to put themselves in those individuals' shoes and see how they would \nfeel. Not everyone is at the same point in his or her development, and you have to \nwork with that. So, you can't criticize them either, because then what good is that \ngoing to do? You want to help guide them towards understanding. \nPre-existing environment. \nLast year, Ada roomed with someone who identifies as bisexual. While her \nroommate was not one of her residents, she discussed her roommate's feelings about the \nhall that she lived in. Ada stated: \"My roommate last year as a freshman was bisexual. \nShe always felt comfortable around the floor, talking with other residents etc. We talked \na lot, and she never felt judged or anything of that nature.\" Daniel reinforced Ada's \nstatement with a personal account of his own involving two residents he works with: \"I \nhave two gay students on my floor ... well, LGBTQ students. And their sexuality has \nnever been an issue. As far as I know, they feel comfortable interacting with others on \nthe floor. And I believe they have been appreciative of the passive and active \nprogramming I have tried to do in relation to LGBTQ awareness.\" \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 42 \nThere appears to be a level of openness among the participants' residents, which \nbecame clear throughout our discussions. Ada recounted overhearing a resident talking \nwith her friend about having a son, and how she said, \"I would have no problem ifhe \nended up falling in love with a boy.\" She recounted another instance where one of her \nother residents stated: \"I'm totally fine with it, as long as it's not overwhelming and in \nmy face. But that goes with any public displays of affection.\" \nDaniel cited how many of his residents are used to interacting with members of \nthe LGBTQ community: \nI've never had any issues and all of my residents, at least I think all of them, know \nthat I'm gay. And it's never been an issue. Whenever I've told people or \nmentioned it in past conversations they've never been turned off by it. It seems \nlike it's something that they are used to and okay with at this stage in their lives \nseeing as a lot of them have been in college for three to four years. They've met \nother students who are gay and have been exposed to these issues. A lot of them \nhave realized that members of the LGBTQ community are normal and just like \nanyone else. That has been my own personal experience, however. I guarantee \nthere are probably some who are not as comfortable with it. \nKate supported this idea of a lot of residents already being open to members of the \nLGBTQ community when she stated: \nI think that there was already a sense of openness because, again, I touched on \nLGBTQ-related issues in the active programming that I did, and no one got all up \nin arms about it. It is entirely possible that they may not have been comfortable \nsaying something if they did have issues, but I did not get that impression. And \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \nthey knew that I had been Safe Zone trained. So, yeah, I definitely think that \nthere was a noticeable sense of openness already in place. \n43 \nBecca discussed the openness of her residents as well, and addressed an interesting point \nin terms of residents who have strong religious beliefs: \nMy residents are very accepting of each other and of new things. Some of them \nhave religious beliefs that conflict with the LGBTQ community. But we've \ntalked about it, and some of those residents said, 'I'm not against them. Growing \nup, that's just not how I was raised to think.' And we've agreed that ifthere is \nsomeone who comes out on our floor that that won't change how they act towards \nthat person. They are still going to treat them like a human being and as part of \nthe residence hall community we have created. So, I would say a lot of them are \nopen despite some of their belief systems being different. Even with those \nreligious beliefs, they have said that, 'I have my own way of thinking, and they \nhave theirs. I'm not going to make them feel uncomfortable.' \nBoth Daniel and Becca addressed how their floor dynamic shifted after their \nresidents went through the diversity meeting they each were required to hold. Daniel \nstated: \"Even thought attendance may not have been the greatest for the other \nprogramming that I did, I feel like the diversity meeting really brought the floor closer \ntogether.\" Becca relayed much of the same: \nAfter that meeting, our floor dynamic really changed. Everyone was just more \nopen and willing to talk about things, and they met new people they hadn't really \nmet before. So, I was really excited. Some of the girls on my floor expressed \nhow LGBTQ-related issues were not something that they had ever talked about at \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 44 \nhome, and how some of them didn't have openly gay students at their high \nschools, so they had never been exposed to topics like that. And they were just as \nexcited to learn more about those issues, almost as much as I was to talk about \nthem. \nSummary \nThis chapter explored the themes found during analysis of the participants' Safe \nZone Phase 1 evaluations and interviews. The themes that emerged fell under 9 \ncategories, which included previous exposure, training style and outcomes, awareness of \nprivilege and advocacy, seeing the bigger picture, preparedness, success with \nprogramming, creating awareness amongst residents, and pre-existing environment. \nChapter V will summarize previous chapters and suggest recommendations for future \nresearch based upon the experiences of the participants. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 45 \nChapterV \nDiscussion \nThe research study utilized a qualitative approach to examine perceptions of how \nwell the Phase l Safe Zone program prepares participants to affect change within the \nresidence halls. The primary purpose of this study was to analyze the perceptions of the \nPhase 1 Safe Zone training among first year RAs in the residence halls. A secondary \npurpose was to examine how first year RAs perceive their ability to utilize training \nmaterial in order to interact with LGBTQ students and implement programming within \nthe context of the residence hall environment. Therefore, the following research \nquestions were asked: (1) What are the perceptions of first year RAs as they are trained in \nthe Phase 1 Safe Zone program?; (2) What are the perceptions of first year RAs as they \nimplement what they have learned, from the Phase 1 Safe Zone program, in their \nresidence halls? This chapter will discuss the results of the study in relation to the \nliterature reviewed, provide recommendations for professionals in the field, and suggest \nfuture areas of study on this topic. \nSignificance of Findings \nLGBTQ exposure and interactions. \nIt has been reported that LGBTQ students who attend schools with Gay Straight \nAlliances (GSAs) and other safe space initiatives feel less isolated, exhibit a greater \nwillingness to be involved in school and community activities, experience more positive \nrelationships with peers and staff, and are more motivated academically (Mayberry \n2006). Two of the participants, Kate and Ada, consider themselves allies to the LGBTQ \ncommunity, and both attended larger high schools, in suburban areas, with GSA-type \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 46 \ngroups. When speaking of her high school experience, Ada stated, \"It was a very open \nschool. There were quite a few gay individuals, as well as people from all different races \nand ethnicities.\" Kate also expressed how, from her viewpoint, being a part of the \nLGBTQ community at her high school was not a big deal: \"I knew people who identified \nas LGBTQ, and as far as I know there were never any major issues that they faced. At \nsome schools ... you hear how they had students ... who were constantly harassed and \nbullied ... Fortunately, we did not have anything like that occur.\" While previous research \npurports students having better experiences at schools with GSAs, Daniel went to a \nCatholic high school without a GSA, and is still cited as having a very positive \nexperience: \"It was pretty accepting, I would say. I came out to friends and family my \nsenior year and I didn't really encounter any problems. They didn't have any sort of \nPride group at my school, or anything like that. However, I believe most people were \npretty cool about it.\" \nEnhancement of heterosexual privilege is an issue that was found throughout the \nliterature reviewed for this study. Many LGBTQ students still consider information to be \ncentered on the needs of the heterosexual majority. Thus, there is a need for resources \nthat focus more on the needs of the gender and sexual minorities present on campus. \nThese sources are not only great for LGBTQ students, but for allies as well, because they \nwill allow allies to learn more about the LGBTQ community and expose them to the \nculture that surrounds it (Schaller 2011). Reflecting on the Safe Zone training, Ada \ndiscussed her level of preparedness to interact with the LGBTQ community and handle \nLGBTQ-related issues through utilization of resources provided during training: \"I would \nlike to think that I am more prepared ... [so that] if a student came to me with any \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 47 \nproblems or questions, I [would] have resources on hand which I could utilize. So, if I'm \nnot able to answer something, I at least have those [physical] resources along with the \nonline resources mentioned during the training.\" Exposure to these various resources \nallowed Ada and the other participants from the study the opportunity to gain a greater \nunderstanding of the LGBTQ community and apply the material in a real-world context. \nPrevious research has shown that levels ofheterosexism and homophobia \nincreased as LGBTQ students' perceptions of the residence hall climate became more \nnegative (Fanucce & Taub 2010), and that LGBTQ individuals often feel as though they \nneed to conceal their sexual identity and gender expression for fear of others reactions \n(Rankin 2003). The four first year RAs utilized in this study believe in the mission of the \nSafe Zone program, but have not personally experienced heterosexim/homophobia. \nDespite this fact, they feel as though the residence halls on campus are open and \nwelcoming. Ada, while recounting living with her bisexual roommate freshman year, \nstated: \"She always felt comfortable around the floor, talking with other residents etc. \nWe talked a lot and she never felt judged or anything of that nature.\" Daniel reinforced \nthis personal account with one of his own: \"I have two gay students on my floor ... well, \nLGBTQ students. And their sexuality has never been an issue. As far as I know they feel \ncomfortable interacting with other on the floor.\" He further supported his claim by \nstating: \"It seems like [interacting with LGBTQ] is something that [my residents] are \nused to and okay with at this stage in their lives, seeing as a lot of them have been in \ncollege for three to four years ... [and have] met other students who are gay and have been \nexposed to these issues.\" On the flip side, Daniel did express that other students may not \nbe as comfortable interacting with the LGBTQ community, especially younger students \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 48 \nwho are new to the college environment or students who have had a certain type of \nupbringing. Some members of the LGBTQ community within the residence halls may \nalso not feel as comfortable opening up to others on their floor. While this was not \ndirectly stated by any of the participants, it was alluded to in a comment made by Kate \nwhen she discussed the emotional turmoil LGBTQ individuals may go through while \nthey are discovering who they are: \"Being LGBTQ is part of who you are, but it isn't all \nthat you are. And you should take pride in who you are, not hide it away where no one \ncan see the real you. And the fact that sometimes these individuals don't feel as though \nthey can have that sense of pride is hard to swallow.\" \nWithin the literature, there was an emphasis on greater contact with a minority \ngroup as a way of reducing prejudices and fears by showing specific myths, stereotypes, \nand certain preconceived notions are unfounded (Lance 2002; Lance 2008; and Rye & \nMeaney 2009). This method of social contact theory is also known as the \"contact \nhypothesis.\" While the brief contact between participants and the LGBTQ \ncommunity/LGBTQ-related issues found in Safe Zone training is not sufficient enough to \ndevelop a full comprehensive understanding, it has the potential to allow participants to \nsee the bigger picture and create a certain level of investment (Rye & Meaney 2009). \nUpon reflection, Becca mentioned how the training allowed her to be more intentional in \nhow she addressed certain situations, as well as more invested in her residents: \"I want to \nmake sure that I have done everything that I can in order to make sure that they are \ncomfortable enough to come and talk to me, or to feel that way on our floor.\" Kate also \nexpressed how the training allowed her see the bigger picture and put herself in the shoes \nof someone who identifies as LGBTQ: \"It got you to put yourself in the place of someone \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 49 \nwho is part of that community ... [and] I want to help others realize that it's not just about \ntolerating or accepting members of the LGBTQ community. It's about celebrating all \nthat they have to offer, who they are as people. I really care about members of the \nLGBTQ community.\" Kate goes on to discuss how exposure to the various training \nactivities, especially the Riddle Homophobia Scale, helped her to put things into \nperspective and motivated her to be an even better ally. \nImpact and outcomes of safe zone training. \nSafe Zone aims to create a safer, more inclusive environment for LGBTQ \nstudents on campus. In order to do so, certain things need to occur. Mayberry (2006) \ntalked about systemic change as a way of changing school culture by addressing social \njustice and equity issues throughout the entire \"ecosystem\" of the school and its \nsurrounding community. And that systemic change all starts with challenging how one \nthinks about the population ofLGBTQ students. Safe Zone training is open to anyone on \ncampus, as well as individuals in the surrounding community; it was developed as a way \nto challenge those who are being trained as allies to the LGBTQ community in regards to \ntheir heterosexual privilege, their levels of homophobia, and their knowledge of basic \nLG BT-related issues. However, one thing that both Ada and Kate noted was that the \nSafe Zone training wasn't forceful, and that it didn't \"shove information down your \nthroat.\" Kate stated: \"The trainers mentioned that they understood how every individual \nis going to have their own opinions and beliefs [and] that everyone is at a different \nstage ... They came at things from more of a place of understanding, helping to educate \npeople and inform them.\" Ada reinforced this thought by stating: \"They really wanted us \nto feel comfortable with the subject matter, and if you didn't agree with the information \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 50 \nyou didn't have to sign the intent form.\" Systemic change doesn't occur quickly. It takes \ntime, and by giving Safe Zone participants the option of signing a statement of intent and \nbecoming a safe zone this change can occur more naturally; it isn't forced. \nIn a study by Macintosh (2007), the story of a pre-service teacher who was stuck \nin a particular train of thought, where his classroom seemed exempt from LGBTQ-related \nissues because he only taught math, was discussed. He couldn't comprehend why talking \nabout such issues mattered, and was not even aware that his thought process only further \nperpetuated the invisibility of LBGTQ individuals and the issues that they face. Ada put \nit best when she stated: \"Most people don't even notice or think about those privileges. \nAnd going through the training forces you to become more aware of those things. I will \nadmit that, before the training, I didn't even think about those privileges that I possess. \nAnd now, it's sort of upsetting to think [about].\" \nIt is important to address the issues of homophobia and heterosexual privilege on \ncollege campuses because it is very common for college students to \"come out\" to peers, \nmentors, and family during their college years (Holland, Matthews, & Schott 2013 ). \nDaniel, personally, found the training to be very helpful in this regard, and discussed the \nreal world application of information in this type of situation: \"You begin to understand \nhow [being inclusive of that individual] looks and how you should, and shouldn't, act in \nthat type of situation. You also realize some of the difficulties those students may \nencounter on a social, academic, and emotional level.\" He further stated, \"I don't think a \nlot of people really know how they are supposed to act and what they are supposed to do. \n[So] the scenario application part of the training spoke to things that could actually \nhappen.\" \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 51 \nMacintosh (2007) utilized the experience with the pre-service math instructor as \nan opportunity to educate and challenge him to become more aware. Allies are in the \ngreatest position, after being Safe Zone trained, to enact change and educate on a college \ncampus, or, in the case of my study, within the residence halls. While reflecting about \nher training experience, Becca stated: \"Before I was supportive of the LGBTQ \ncommunity ... But now, I feel this sense of wanting, to step up and educate others ... I just \ndon't think everyone is as educated, especially depending on where you come from or \nwhat your family upbringing is. So, I think that the best thing we can do as allies is to \nadvocate and educate others.\" Ada further reinforced Becca's sentiments when she \ncommunicated the following: \"My thought process changed after the training. You can \nbelieve in equal rights and equality, or you can actually act on it and show you're a \nsupporter of the LGBTQ community and that you believe in the cause.\" This shift in \nthought was echoed throughout all of the interviews conducted during this study, and all \nfour participants thought educating others and actively showing support as an ally were \nvital to creating an impact on campus and in the residence halls. Similarly, Fox & Ore \n(2010) opined that safe space initiatives like Safe Zone aim to raise visibility and create \neducational programs that increase awareness of LGBTQ issues and address the presence \nof heterosexism and homophobia in campus culture. \nCreating greater awareness and visibility. \nThe idea of creating a safer environment means educating the community-at-\nlarge, and expressing common ground and shared values, in order to increase tolerance \nand promote greater awareness (Drumheller and McQuay 2010). This idea of increasing \ntolerance and promoting awareness all comes back to putting yourself in the shoes of \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 52 \nmembers of the LGBTQ community. When talking about her appreciation for the \ntraining, Kate stated: \"It might be a completely different scenario than the ones we went \nover in the training. But, at least you have some common knowledge and background of \nhow you would want to be treated in that situation. So, you are able to put yourself in \nthose students' shoes.\" In similar light, Kate also addressed how the training taught her \nto meet her residents where they are at, rather than reprimanding them for their lack of \nknowledge when it comes to the LGBTQ community: \"Everyone has different \nbackgrounds and the most important thing I think we can do as RAs is to bring awareness \nto the resident who may have made a poor comment or acted a certain way. I try to get \nthem to put themselves in those individuals' shows and see how they would feel. .. You \nwant to help guide them towards understanding.\" \nPrevious research has shown that drawing attention to LGBTQ-related issues is a \ngreat way of combatting heterosexual privilege and homophobia (Currie, Mayberry, & \nChenneville 2012). While unintentional, Kate created a program for her residents that \nallowed them to draw connections between the stereotypes they came up with about the \nLGBTQ community and how that relates to heterosexual privilege and homophobia. For \nthe activity, residents were asked to come up with stereotypes for a variety of different \ngroups and communities of people. Kate noted that some of the stereotypes they wrote \ndown were negative, but not all. Some were positive. Reflecting on the activity, she \nstated: \"It allowed us to have a very open discussion about why some of the stereotypes \nthey wrote down are bad and how we can help to combat them.\" \nResidential living can have a very important educational impact on students. \nAnd, it is important to understand how all students, including those who identify as \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 53 \nLGBTQ, fit into on-campus living settings and how they are influenced by the residential \nenvironment (Funucce & Taub 2010). While Kate was really the only study participant \nto have any substantial success with the active programming she did, the others relayed \nmuch greater success with passive programming that they implemented throughout the \ncourse of the fall semester. Throughout our discussions, Daniel and Kate mentioned how \nresidents had gone out of their way to make comments that let them know they \nappreciated the passive programming they had implemented. Daniel stated, \"I had a \nbulletin board for LGBTQA History Month ... Some [residents] said they liked it a lot. \nAnd others said that it was very informative.\" Kate also did a bulletin board for \nLGBTQA History Month, and stated: \"It was kind of cool because some of my residents \nwalked by and were like, 'Hey, Kate is doing this for us!' So, I thought that it was really \nnice to be able to put that out there and to have them appreciate the gesture.\" While \nDaniel and Kate's experiences were very similar, there was an obvious impact that their \npassive programming had, even on those who identify as LGBTQ. \nA study conducted by Roper (2005) discussed how the act of community building \nin the residence halls is not advocacy but active ally work that allows RAs to lead in \nways that validate the LGBTQ community and address the needs ofLGBTQ students. \nBecca put it best, when she discussed how even just paying attention to the small things, \nlike how you word/phrase something can make a huge difference in making LGBTQ \nresidents feel more comfortable: \"Even just being aware of what people say and how they \ntalk can be extremely important. I know some people don't think about the way that they \nsay things. However, with my floor I try to get them to change their language and be \nmore conscientious.\" After making this statement, Becca said something that showed \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 54 \ntremendous growth and understanding. She stated, \"I think that it's important to be \naware of the privilege I possess, but to also realize that I can combat those privileges and \nhelp the LGBTQ community.\" Becca realized that there was strength in the privilege that \nshe possesses, that that privilege could be the impetus to her becoming a better ally. In \nterms of building a community (a.k.a. active ally work), Becca discussed how important \nshe thinks it is for all of her residents to feel comfortable talking and interacting with one \nanother. So, she will have them frequently sit in the various lobbies of her hall to gain \nsome valuable face-to-face interaction with one another: \"It's fine if they come to me \nwith problems. However, I also want them to be able to deal with issues themselves, to \nbe able to stand up to a fellow resident and say, 'That's not okay' or 'Why don't you use \nthis word instead' etc. And, they really do a good job. It's like our own little \ngovernment. Everyone has their role, and understands that they need to learn to deal with \nissues in a calm, diplomatic way. So, it's nice.\" This sense of autonomy, and level of \ncomfort with one another, is something every RA should aspire to foster within their \nresidents. \nSuggestions For Future Research \nIf the study were to follow a similar format, my first suggestion would be to \nobtain a more representative pool of participants, preferably one RA from each hall on \ncampus. Due to the qualitative nature of this study, only four participants were utilized \nthis time around, each from different residence halls. If one participant were to be \nobtained for each residence hall, a research team would need to be assembled in order to \ntranscribe and code all of the data that would potentially be gathered. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 55 \nA second suggestion for future research is to conduct a quantitative study on the \neffectiveness of the Safe Zone program at the Midsize, Midwestern University chosen for \nthis study. Due to the qualitative nature of the current study, effectiveness of the Safe \nZone program could not be assessed. I would also suggest future researchers survey \nanyone who has participated in the Safe Zone Phase One program for that academic year. \nThis broadens the scope of the pool of participants, but keeps it from becoming an \nunmanageable amount. \nMy third suggestion for future research would be to once again only have 4-6 \nparticipants as part of a qualitative study to analyze perceptions of the Safe Zone Phase 1 \nprogram. However, instead oflimiting the participant pool to only first year RAs, future \nresearchers could open the pool up to anyone who has participated in Safe Zone during \nthat academic year. \nA fourth suggestion would be to conduct a longitudinal study of the original four \nparticipants. This could provide interesting results, as it would allow the researcher to \nsee how participants' viewpoints and perceptions of the training change over time. A \nlongitudinal study would also create a greater opportunity for participants to implement \nmore specific, LGBTQ-related programming. The researcher could then analyze the \nperceived effects said programming has on residents within the residence halls. \nLastly, while the participant pool was diverse in terms ofresidence hall and \nprevious exposure to the LGBTQ community, it would be beneficial to establish a more \ndiverse participant pool in regards to race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual \npreference, and gender identity. Achieving this level of diversity within the participant \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM \npool is impossible with only 4 participants. Thus, this would need to be accomplished \nwith a much larger participant pool. \nConclusion \n56 \nThis study was conducted utilizing a qualitative approach to better understand \nfirst year RAs perceptions of the Safe Zone Phase One training, as well as to examine \nhow first year RAs utilize training material in order to interact with LGBTQ students and \nimplement programming within the context of the residence hall environment. Chapter V \nconsisted of a discussion of the results from the study. The results indicated that the first \nyear RAs utilized for this study found the Safe Zone Phase One training to be helpful in \nterms of preparing them to interact with LGBTQ students and implement programming \nthat is geared towards the LGBTQ community. While most of the participants wished \nthey had had more time to implement more successful active programming, they had a \npositive experience with the passive programming they implemented in the residence \nhalls. The results also indicated a greater sense of awareness and a motivation to educate \ntheir residents on LGBTQ issues. Suggestions for future research were also provided. \nCONTEXTUAL CONDITIONS OF SAFE ZONE PROGRAM 57 \nReferences \nAlvvarez, S.D., & Schneider, J. (2008).

    "abstract": "Since the 1990s, safe space initiatives, such as Safe Zone, have been developed on college campuses across the United States as a way of educating participants on LGBTQ-related issues and how to become a better ally/advocate for the LGBTQ community. While little qualitative research has been conducted on safe space initiatives to begin with, there is even less research on the perceptions participants have of these types of programs. Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to analyze the perceptions of the Phase 1 Safe Zone training among first year RAs in the residence halls. A secondary purpose was to examine how first year RAs perceive their ability to utilize training material in order to interact with LGBTQ students and implement programming within the context of the residence hall environment. Findings from the present qualitative study suggest that participants found the Phase One Safe Zone training to be educational and transformative, stating that it allowed them to see the bigger picture and become more aware of the privileges that they possess. The study\\u27s participants also felt that, while much of the active programming they attempted elicited a lackluster response, it allowed them to create a greater sense of awareness among their residents",
