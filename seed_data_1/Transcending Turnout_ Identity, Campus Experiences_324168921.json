Transcending Turnout: Identity, Campus Experiences, and the Political Behaviors of Latinx Youth Abstract Latinx youth are increasingly the focus of American politics and campaigns. They are a passionate and ever-growing segment of what is predicted to be the largest ethnic group of eligible voters in 2020. However, this population consistently produces low rates of turnout in national elections. This thesis aims to understand how the campus experiences of Latinx undergraduates may influence their political behaviors in light of recent events. Political behaviors are assessed by political views and political participation in both electoral and nonelectoral activities. Using survey data from the Higher Education Research Institute, the study first investigates changes in students' political behaviors from their freshmen to senior years. It then examines the relationship between those behaviors and campus experiences. The research analyzes the results based on differences in identity such as sexual orientation, gender, socioeconomic background, and acculturation. The paper also provides deeper insight into campus experiences through in-person interviews at the University of Pennsylvania. The results conclude that campus experiences that make Latinx identity salient and provide students with opportunities for education on social issues and activism have the greatest impact on political behaviors. Participation in identity-based organizations and first-hand experiences of discrimination show significant positive effects on political behaviors, namely political participation. Students who feel that racial tension is present on their campuses are also increasingly left-leaning and have higher levels of political participation. The research also found that students show passionate reactions to cases of national group threat and that those of intersectional identities are more likely to have higher rates of political engagement. The paper then provides insight into future research on understanding the dynamics of Latinx students and political engagement.

III  Acknowledgements  This thesis is the culmination of passion, academic interest, and the help and support of so many incredible individuals. First and foremost, this research would not have been possible without the guidance of my advisor, Dr. Michael Jones-Correa. Thank you for providing endless insight and acting as a sounding board for the many ideas, excitement, and worries that I shared throughout this process. A special thanks is also reserved for Dr. Eileen Doherty-Sil and the Department of Political Science, for creating an academically rigorous environment which fostered my passion for the subject and granted me the necessary skills to complete a project such as this. Even amid unprecedented global events, the faculty showed endless support and understanding for thesis students and the community as a whole.    I also take this opportunity to thank those who deserve more credit than I could ever provide: my family and friends. To my parents, Danny and Denise, thank you for fostering in me the notion to always challenge what I am taught and to go after what I am most passionate about. To the rest of my family, thank you for instilling in me our traditions, food, and an endless amount of support. I also consider my close friends to be part of this family – both those in California and from Penn. Thank you for respecting the amount of time I dedicated to this project and for encouraging me when I doubted myself most. To Mawi - thank you for always resolving my questions on data analysis.   Lastly, and most importantly, a special thanks to those I interviewed during this process – for trusting me as a fellow student and for opening up with such incredible insights into your personal experiences on campus. This thesis would have been impossible without you.  In 2015, I discovered my passion for politics and within months found myself canvassing for a presidential campaign in my hometown of Corona, California. Since then, I have had the unique opportunity to bring that passion to life: interviewing politicians on-campus, interacting with top scholars, and spending a semester in Washington D.C. Throughout this experience, my identity as a Mexican-American has become increasingly salient, influencing the assumptions which people have of me, the words which individuals say to me, and the reactions that I have to current events. It is with this thesis that I hope to extend the voice that I have been given as a Penn student to so many others that may share this experience. Latinx students are young, passionate, and engaged, by whatever definition that may be, in the causes that matter most.

becoming the focus of research, the media, and American politics. At its current state, the Latinx population in the United States grows at an estimated 2% every year due to increased immigration and rising fertility rates.1 The population is also overwhelmingly young – in 2014, the median age for individuals identifying as Latinx was 28, with over a third of the population being under 18.2 With such a high growth rate, the study of the political behaviors of Latinx youth is increasingly important in understanding the impacts of changing political rhetoric and a new generation of potential voters. Every year, there are about 767,000 new Latinx adult citizens. 35% of that population become potential voters through naturalization, while the remaining 65% become potential voters by turning 18.3 Latinx political behavior and turnout is determined by the number of those who are of voting age, eligible citizens, and registered to vote. These structural forces deeply influence political engagement in the Latinx community. While a portion of the population can vote, others are still undergoing the processes of becoming citizens and face a long history of voter disenfranchisement and poor access to registration.4     The political behaviors of the Latinx population, especially among the youth, have also become a focus of scholars due to recent political events. Namely, the campaign, election, and presidency of Donald Trump. The 2016 election and the years that followed have demonstrated vast amounts of public rhetoric aimed toward the Latinx population and specifically, toward Latinx immigrants. Most notably, and often cited in studies on xenophobic rhetoric, are  1 Jones-Correa, M., Al-Faham, H. & Cortez, D. (2018).

These proposals included increasing the deportation of undocumented immigrants, ending birthright citizenship, terminating the DACA program, and overall, reducing the number of legal immigrants admitted into the U.S.6 Often, statements related to these policies were made at the expense of Latinx communities in the U.S.  Despite apparent threats toward Latinx group identity and vigorous get-out-the-vote campaigns by Democrats and nonpartisan organizations, only 34.3% of Latinx youth aged 18 to 24 voted in the 2016 presidential election.7 Since 2016, the policies enacted by the Trump Administration have only further aimed to marginalize immigrant and Latinx communities. In the summer of 2018, the Administration separated an estimated 1,995 children8 from their parents at the border as part of its “zero tolerance” immigration policy.9 Later that fall, an image circulated across social media of a migrant mother and her young children running as U.S. Border Patrol threw tear gas canisters at the border in Tijuana, Mexico.10 Per a report from the F.B.I., the number of victims from anti-Latinx hate crimes in the U.S. rose over 21% in 2018,  5 Washington Post Staff.

Still, several questions remain as to what drives engagement among Latinx youth.   This thesis aims to understand how campus experiences for Latinx undergraduates may influence their political behaviors, especially in light of the recent political atmosphere. The research questions guiding this thesis are: How do student experiences throughout college impact their political behaviors? How have these behaviors changed? Several additional motivating questions also arise. What roles do identity, socioeconomic status, national origin, and acculturation play in influencing Latinx youth? How does socialization impact ethnic identity? What is the role of group threat when addressing issues of political rhetoric and discrimination? How can these findings influence the strategies of campaigns? Although the research at hand is intended to focus on the primary questions, it will shed light on the importance of others necessary to understanding the role of the Latinx community within U.S. politics and the implications of negative rhetoric toward minority and marginalized groups as a whole.  Each of these motivating questions possesses a high level of relevance to a variety of stakeholder groups. The Latinx community is inherently diverse, with individuals belonging to a variety of national origin groups, each with its own distinct culture, practices, and history. The Latinx population is not a homogenous race. Rather, it is a diverse ethnic group with individuals identifying as white, Black, indigenous, or a mixture of these many identities. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the wide variety of political issues that mobilize members of these communities. Interest in certain issues may vary by experience, socioeconomic status,  11 Brooks, B. (2019, November 12). Victims of anti-Latino hate crimes soar in U.S.: FBI report. Reuters. Retrieved from https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hatecrimes-report/victims-of-anti-latino-hate-crimes-soar-in-us-fbi-report-idUSKBN1XM2OQ 4  geographic region, and national origin group. Age may also be a major determinant. In 2016, the Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey found that young Latinx voters were more likely to feel angry or sad during the presidential election and care about issues related to race. Yet they were also less likely to value voting and trust the processes of the government when compared with Latinx adults.12 Here, it is necessary to analyze how surges in racial threat may have impacted the methods by which Latinx youth organize themselves.  While this research will provide an analytical and descriptive account of the political behaviors of Latinx youth, it will be done in the hopes to inspire action. In understanding such a dynamic portion of the American population, campaigns and organizers can better understand how to improve their engagement strategies, outreach, and messaging to better motivate a portion of voters too often underrepresented at the polls. An understanding of these factors and motivations may also contribute to the overall conversation on how the political system views the Latinx population and how the Latinx community can have a greater role within governance. Overview  This thesis begins by outlining the history and background of Latinx political engagement in the U.S. The primary focus is a quantitative analysis of full-time undergraduate students using data from the Higher Education Research Institute’s Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP). The findings in the analysis are supplemented by a qualitative study of a small sample of current Latinx undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania. The analyses are intended to evaluate changing political views and political participation over time by various identities. It will also examine the relationships between political behaviors and campus experiences such as interactions with other identities and involvement in identity-based organizations.  12 Barreto, M., Frasure-Yokley, L., Vargas, E.D., & Wong, J.

It is used as a pan-ethnic term to refer to people in the United States of Latin American descent. This includes citizens and immigrants of any status. “Latinx” derives from the term “Latino,” which has traditionally been used as a description of pan-ethnicity rather than a focus on specific Latinx identities.13  Often, national origin groups have unique terms to describe their cultural and ethnic identities. These terms include Chicano, Boricua, Quisqueya/o. The term \"Latinx\" is also relatively new as it stemmed out of the internet and social media around 2014. At its creation, it was intended to refer to \"indigenous populations, citizens, and communities of people from Latin American countries and dependencies.\"14  The term also holds significance as a term of inclusion, stemming from the LGBTQ+ movement to resist gender binary and serve as a term that includes and recognizes transgender and non-binary individuals.15    13 Geron, K.

In 1979, social psychologists Henri Tajfel and John Turner proposed the idea that groups in which people belong to provide individuals with a source of pride or self-esteem – creating a sense of belonging to the social world based on group membership.16 This theory also applies to the sense of belonging and pride which someone holds within their racial or ethnic identity. For Latinx and Asian American communities, an individual's identification with their relative ethnic group can often depend on factors of language and acculturation. Acculturation, in this context, refers to the assimilation of immigrants to the dominant \"American\" culture. In 2015, one study found that acculturation impacted individual reactions to xenophobic rhetoric. When Latinx individuals were presented with xenophobic statements about immigrants, participants with lower levels of acculturation (based on characteristics of being foreign-born/second generation or Spanish-speaking) were more likely to react in a way that asserted their ethnic group's value in society.17 Latino Decisions, a Latinx-focused polling firm, conducted a similar study assessing the salience of immigration and reactions to negative rhetoric among Latinx respondents. The study asked individuals to rank issues which they were most concerned about in the 2012 presidential election then presented them with anti-immigrant sentiments from candidates. For individuals who ranked immigration as second to economic concerns or completely omitted immigration for their top issues, hearing an anti-immigrant statement pushed them away from a candidate with  16 Tajfel, H. & Turner, J. (2004). An Integrative Theory on Intergroup Conflict. In M.J. Hatch & M. Schultz (Eds.) Organizational Identity: A Reader (pp. 56-65). Oxford: Oxford University Press. 17 Pérez, E.O. (2015). Xenophobic Rhetoric and Its Political Effects on Immigrants and Their Co Ethnics. American Journal of Political Science, 59(3). 549-564. https://www.jstor.org/stable/24583082?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents 7  whom they agreed with on other issues, resultingly making them less likely to support that candidate. Even for individuals who did not have immigration as part of their immediate family’s “Latino identity” (namely third and fourth-generation individuals), hearing anti-immigrant sentiments pushed them away from candidates.18  These ideas are intertwined with the concept of group consciousness, which assumes that an individual realizes that their life chances are interrelated with those of their group. Group consciousness is of particular interest when studying Latinx political behavior because of its ability to predict increased political participation.19 This consciousness becomes politicized when a racial or ethnic minority begins to attach the social and political problems of their group to systemic causes that require political action (i.e. public demonstration, voting, or legislative action) to be resolved. This theory has been used to understand how Asian American and Latinx communities might assert their group identities in politics. A study focused on youth found that the ethnic and political makeup of an individual’s surrounding environment influenced their level of identification with their relative ethnic group. Even participants who reported that they were labeled as “whitewashed” by their peers still asserted positive attachments to their identities.20  Group consciousness has been found to develop among Latinx individuals when they learn about Latinx identity.21 This consciousness can impact how others view an individual. Merely being seen as “Hispanic” by others can lead to higher rates of discrimination than if someone appeared as “White.” In a Pew Research study, 41% of Latinx individuals who claimed  18 Barreto, M. & Segura, G.A.

It questions whether or not individuals hold a sense of identity strictly to their national origin (i.e. Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban) or to the broader term of “Latinx,” Latino/a,” or “Hispanic,” especially in cases where Latinx identity is politicized.23 Expressions of pan-ethnicity are also tied with linked fate or immigrant-linked fate, defined as whether or not an individual believes that things happening to immigrants or other Latinx individuals would impact their own lives. For example, someone who identifies as a third or fourth-generation Mexican American might feel that their fate and experience in the U.S. are tied to those of an immigrant from El Salvador. In the case of the 2016 presidential election, scholars characterized Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric as a case of \"national group threat\" toward the Latinx population. Individuals who felt that their identity was being racialized and politicized by Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric were more likely to dislike candidate Trump and to report feelings of anger during the election.24 Pan-ethnicity and group consciousness stem from important characteristics shared by all people of Latinx ethnicity. Matt Barreto describes these characteristics as Latin American heritage, the Spanish language, Spanish colonial influence, and the immigrant experience. Experiences of discrimination augment these characteristics, making shared ethnicity a relevant factor in predicting political participation.25 In terms of the immigrant experience, although Latinx individuals might be the third or fourth generation in the U.S., they still have a connection  22 Hugo Lopez, M., Gonzalez-Barrera, A., Krogstad, J.M., & Pumphrey, J.

A 2016 book found that negative implicit attitudes toward Latinx immigrants were \"conceptually synonymous\" with implicit attitudes toward Latinx individuals broadly. Immigration: Latinx Public Opinion Given the strength of implicit associations between Latinx identity and immigration in culmination with the rise in anti-immigrant rhetoric over recent years, it is necessary to understand how Latinx individuals view issues of immigration. For one, the media often covers the Latinx population in connection with stories on immigration, especially when the skew of those stories are negative.26 A 2013 study found that within the last 25 years, newspapers mentioning immigrants and “Latinos” primed readers to think of Latinx individuals when seeing news on immigration. This has unique consequences for Latinx public opinion on immigration, especially considering that linked fate comes into play. Following the deaths and racial profiling of undocumented immigrants in the 2007 California wildfires, the Latinx population became more coherent on opinions on immigration because many felt discriminated against when witnessing the widespread mistreatment of immigrants during the wildfires.27 An individual's language preference, level of acculturation, and whether or not they know an immigrant also impacts their opinion on these issues. Less accultured individuals are more likely to agree that discrimination against Latinx communities has increased since the 2016 election.28    26 In these negative stories, news outlets have been found to use terms such as “parasites” and “burdens” to refer to immigrants.  27 Aldana, R.E.

Research on these effects is based on the Rejection-Identification model, which theorizes that individuals experience discrimination as a form of social rejection, leading them to identify more with their ingroup. This protects their self-esteem and attributes negative events to the issue of discrimination rather than to personal qualities or attributes. Younger ethnic minorities will develop higher levels of identification with their ethnic identity when they experience discrimination.29 Experiencing discrimination at a young age contributes to an individual's perception of the world, resulting in passionate and informed views and an interest in social justice.30 Marginalized youth are also more likely to feel group solidarity,31 and to build communities with co-ethnics to assert their cultural wealth.32 Discrimination among Latinx and Asian Americans is also positively linked with civic activism but negatively associated with individual beliefs in America as a just society33 and civic beliefs as a whole.34 Latinx Political Engagement  A majority of the research focused on Latinx political engagement is centered around voting, with some studies finding that the likelihood to vote is related to the region of the country  29 Armenta, B.E. & Hunt, J.S.

Social identity and acculturation only have a major predictive role when individuals talk about the importance of immigration.35 Acculturation does, however, impact voting across generations. Between first and third generations, political engagement and voting increases among Latinx individuals, but afterward flattens out at a high turnout rate resembling that of white Americans.36 Latinx voting patterns are also dependent on political recruitment.  Co-ethnic contact by Latinx canvassers is an important piece in mobilization, as it appeals to a collective sense of identity among voters.37 The use of co-ethnic contact was particularly impactful during the 2004 presidential election in which Latinx voters contacted by co-ethnics representing the Bush campaign were more likely to support the candidate than those who were contacted by representatives of a different demographic.38 Co-ethnicity in candidates is also important, as Latinx voters are mobilized by the opportunity to vote for a Latinx candidate and in turn, have an increased perception of the benefits of voting.39 This collective sense of identity among Latinx individuals is a necessary piece of engagement, as it not only encourages voting but participation in nonelectoral activities that have a direct impact on Latinx communities.40 Latinx Political Views and Partisanship  Partisanship among the Latinx population varies by level of acculturation and national origin group. Most often, first-generation immigrants identify as independent of the two  35 Len-Ríos, M.E. (2017).

This tends to be Democrat for Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans and Republican for Cubans.41 This long-standing and traditional partisanship by national origin group is also found to impact the vote preferences of uninformed voters.42 Individuals can feel pressure to conform to the group norm, with independents being the most susceptible to influence by co-ethnics, demonstrating the strength of group identity.43 These five concepts are major themes in political science literature on the Latinx population. They include identity and group consciousness, Latinx opinion on immigration, racial discrimination, and political engagement and partisanship. Although younger Latinx individuals are a large and growing subset of the Latinx population, we still have little insight into what they think and why. Applying these concepts of group consciousness and identity to the experience of Latinx youth will hopefully shed light on the reasons behind their political engagement and partisanship.      41 Alvarez, R.M. & Bedolla, L.G.

Between 2010 and 2016, the Latinx population in the U.S. grew at an exceptional rate stemming from a diverse set of countries and resulting from high birth rates. During this time, the population expanded from 50.8 million people to 57.5 million.45 The median age for the Latinx population has hovered around 27 since 2010, almost eight years younger than the median age of African Americans.46 Latinx turnout has remained relatively lower over the past election cycles – the number of eligible Latinx voters who do not vote has exceeded the number of those who do since 1996.47 Even with anti-immigrant rhetoric surrounding the 2016 election and large growth within the Latinx demographic, turnout rates held steady between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. In 2012, 48% of eligible Latinx voters cast a vote – in 2016 it was 47.6%.48 While the power of the Sleeping Giant may not manifest in voter turnout, the muscle of this population is evident in the unique and rich history of Latinx migration and mobilization. Latinx individuals come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences but have all demonstrated powerful forms of engagement over the last century. Within the past two and a half decades, a variety of events have also served as clear examples of racialized group threat.   44 Openheimer, A. (2019, September 14).

(2017, May 12). 14   Migration Patterns  The Latinx population has a long and diverse history of migration and activism in the U.S. Many migrants have moved due to push factors resulting from long histories of colonization, economic distress, and political disarray in their home countries. During World War II, the U.S. rolled out the Braceros Program which was intended to make up for lost agriculture work by encouraging the allowance of Mexican migrant workers. In that same decade, the government also created Operation Bootstrap, pushing low cost labor and manufacturing into Puerto Rico, which resulted in the migration of approximately 470,000 people to New York City.49 Varying policies like these largely influenced the ways by which Latinx migrants would interact with the legal and political structures around them. One policy in particular forever changed the patterns of Latinx migration into the U.S. – the Hart-Cellar Act of 1965.50 This act removed the quota system, established 120,000 visas for the Western Hemisphere, and encouraged family reunification. This changed the ethno-racial makeup of immigration by allowing Latinx and Asian immigrants to petition for their family members and also created a large scale of unauthorized migration from the Western Hemisphere.51  A long history of political instability has also contributed to this migration. During the late twentieth century, primarily during the Cold War, the United States repeatedly became involved in regime changes abroad in a war against communism. In the 1960s and 1970s, Cubans and Dominicans migrated in massive numbers to escape the Castro and Bosch regimes, respectively. During the 1980s, El Salvador and Guatemala both experienced extreme levels of violence and instability, but the Reagan Administration did little to allow migrants to qualify for  49 García Bedolla, L.

Communities have historically reacted through activism and political action. One of the most popular victories against discrimination in Latinx history is the case of Mendez v. Westminster (1947). The case challenged the Los Angeles public schools which segregated children by white or Mexican. The case ruled against segregation and is widely regarded as a precedent to Brown v. Board of Education (1954).54  Latinx history is also largely consistent with grassroots movements. In the West, Caesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and the United Farm Workers Association brought national attention to labor rights in agriculture. The 1960s Chicano Movement, or \"El Movimiento,\" featured student protests in support of civil rights and education reform for Mexican-Americans. In New York City, the Young Lords Organization formed, modeling their style after the Black Panthers and pushing for the self-determination and civil rights of Puerto Ricans.55 Dominican immigrants developed an incredible power for coalition-building with African Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City. In Florida, Cuban migrants built powerful political coalitions, establishing increasingly large representation within the Republican Party. During the Reagan Administration, migrants and progressive groups formed the Central American Peace and Solidarity Movement (CAPSM) to push for the regularization of migrant  52 García Bedolla, L.

California’s Proposition 187   In the 1980s and early 1990s, California was a relatively red state. The Republican party dominated several state and national elections and made strong efforts to draw in the electoral power of the Latinx population. Between 1980 and 1984, Governor Ronald Reagan grew his Latinx support from 35% to 45%.57 Much of this changed in 1994 with the introduction of Proposition 187. The proposition would require law enforcement to report arrestees who violated immigration laws to the California Attorney General and would bar undocumented immigrants from accessing non-emergency healthcare and public education. Prop 187 was championed by Republican Governor Pete Wilson in his campaign for re-election but widely viewed as a threat to immigrants in the state.58 Although deemed unconstitutional, the initiative passed with 59% of the vote. The bill was followed by Proposition 209, to ban affirmative action 199659 and by Proposition 227 in 1998, to limit California’s bilingual education program.60  These initiatives caused widespread disdain from the Latinx population and had a major role in transforming California into the Democratic state many know it as today. One study found that absent the three ballot proposals and with all other factors remaining the same, between 1980 and 2002 there was an 18% increase in the probability of Latinx individuals seeing  56 García Bedolla, L.

Between 1994 and 2004, 66% of the 1.8 million newly registered voters in California were Latinx.63 An analysis focused on Los Angeles County between 1992 and 1998 found that of newly registered Latinx voters (approximately a net of 275,504 new registrants), only 10% identified themselves as aligned with the Republican party.64 Although some alluded to it, high rates of naturalization from the 1986 IRCA had little impact on voter registration.65 Rather, contentious debates surrounding immigration – many related to the California ballot proposals – had a greater influence over voter registration.66 Those who came into the electorate during a time of combative politics for the Latinx community demonstrated a continued interest in voting, drove turnout, and were better informed than average.67 2006 Immigration Marches In December 2005, Rep. Sensenbrenner (R-WI) introduced H.R. 4437, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act.

In Chicago alone, 300,000 people were marching in one day.70 The marches were extremely significant to Latinx identity and its connection to the issue of immigration. It brought the conversation of unauthorized immigrants into the forefront of the discourse on immigration policy. Messages from the protests also appealed to, and likely contributed to, increased self-identification within the pan-ethnic group of \"Latinx.\"71 Not only that, but it made the issue of immigration personal. The bill was far-reaching, meaning that it would have likely impacted educators, health care workers, local priests, and the family and friends of many undocumented immigrants.72 2010: SB 1070 and the DREAM Act In 2010, Arizona state proposed SB 1070, a bill that would allow law enforcement to ask individuals for proof of proper documentation allowing them to be in the United States.73 The bill was focused on identifying undocumented immigrants in the state but nearly guaranteed the use of racial profiling. Regarding the reactions by Latinx communities across the country, scholars wrote, “Issues that cut to the heart of ethnic identity are particularly likely to transcend  68 Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005.

Reactions to the bill included calls for boycotts from immigrant, Latinx rights, and labor organizations75 and protests from many celebrities and music groups.76 The bill was signed into law in Arizona but several legal challenges were filed against it, including one by the Department of Justice under President Obama. Although it eventually made it to the Supreme Court with Arizona v. United States and three provisions were struck down, the “show me your papers” provision was upheld.77 In September 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union and National Immigration Law Center and Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund requested that an injunction be placed on the law on the basis that it encouraged lengthy detention of “people with a Latino phenotype” and that it violated the Equal Protection Clause.78 2010 also saw the official vote on the DREAM Act in Congress.

In these elections, 60% of Latinx voters said that immigration was “very” important to their choice to vote and choice of candidate.80 Looking Ahead In 2020, the number of eligible Latinx voters is estimated to be at 32 million – exceeding 30 million eligible African American voters and 11 million eligible Asian American voters.81 While this number speaks to a growing Latinx population, it highlights the importance of mobilizing these communities come Election Day. With this, many researchers ask: How powerful is the Latinx vote? What is the potential for Latinx turnout in light of recent political events? Latino Decisions, in partnership with America's Voice and Immigration Hub, produced an assessment of the Latinx vote in 2020 titled \"The Latino Vote Project.\" In their research, they found that using recent Trump rhetoric against Latinx communities and communities of color was an \"effective issue area and point of activation for Latino voter engagement and turnout.\" To mobilize Latinx communities in 2020, they found that it will be necessary to improve funding of organizations, hire canvassers from Latinx communities, and to better understand subgroups within the Latinx population. Not only that, but the research identified clear opportunities in states with large Latinx populations such as Arizona, Nevada, and Texas.82   79 Wong, S. & Toeplitz, S. (2010, December 18).

In the context of recent years, it is imperative to understand how the increased salience of immigration and anti-Latinx platforms might mobilize the Latinx community. It is especially urgent to understand how this might mobilize Latinx youth, given their unique position of experiencing national group threat and first-hand acts of discrimination during a period of identity and world view formation. If the history of Latinx activism and protests of recent decades tell us anything, it is that ethnic identity influences mobilization and politicization. This research aims to address the gap in the literature, questioning the role of the college experience on the political socialization of Latinx youth. Do students enter university life politicized, or is it a process that occurs through their experiences, courses, and peer relationships?   22  Data  This thesis aims to understand the political behaviors of Latinx college students and their campus experiences through quantitative and qualitative methods. Understanding the political behaviors of Latinx students is not only important because they are becoming a larger part of the electorate, but because their college experiences often inform their world views. This is largely based on critical consciousness theory, defined as \"how oppressed individuals may view their abilities to intervene in the reality of their oppression and change it for the better.\"83 This suggests that those with a strong connection to their identity, especially as young adults, may be more likely to participate in social action in both the present and future. Socialization has a large impact on this as well, exposing young adults to different attitudes and large-scale political events that influence future political outlooks and engagement.84 Formal institutions and organizations serve as primary grounds for socialization and are regarded as inherently political experiences that impact later political outlooks.85 Prior membership in civic or public-oriented organizations during adolescence has been found to influence higher levels of political engagement later in life.86 These organizations provide students with the skills necessary for engagement and for overcoming any sense of fear and powerlessness felt by marginalized communities. Differences in institutions and campus cultures also have unique effects on political socialization. One study found that wealthy liberal arts schools encouraged students to engage in deliberation and collegial discourse while a commuter  83 Diemer, M.A. & Li, C. (2011).

On college campuses, students are exposed to varying ideologies, current events, and the opportunity to engage in many identity-based organizations. This dynamic experience is why we turn to the data to explore questions about group consciousness, racial discrimination, political engagement, and partisanship.  The survey data is from the University of California, Los Angeles’ Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) data archive. HERI is part of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP), which is a “national longitudinal study of the American higher education system. It is regarded as the most comprehensive source of information on college students.”89 The CIRP is the nation's largest and oldest study of higher education. Administered since 1973, the survey collects data from over 1900 institutions, 15 million students, and 200,000 faculty. The data used in this research comes from The Freshmen Survey (TFS) and the College Senior Survey (CSS). The TFS creates a snapshot of students' behaviors, opinions, and experiences before college. The CSS focuses on academic, civic, and diversity outcomes among students. In this research, the TFS and CSS will be used together as longitudinal data, with findings supplemented by in-person qualitative interviews.  Preferably, an analysis would be conducted on students who were enrolled in undergraduate study during the current presidential administration. In a 2018 survey of the  87 Verduzco Reyes, D.

However, due to the availability of data, the data used for this study comes from 2016. Meaning, the respondents in the survey attended college between Fall 2012 and Spring 2016. This will provide an ample and sufficient look into the experience of Latinx college students and provide an overlap with the start of Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2015. The survey population has been limited to full-time enrolled Latinx students, with the use of students identifying as White/Caucasian as a comparison group in the longitudinal study.    90 Hugo Lopez, M., Gonzalez-Barrera, A., Krogstad, J.M., & Pumphrey, J. (2018, October 25). 25  Methods   The analyses seek to understand Latinx students’ campus experiences and political behaviors. It is split into two main phases: longitudinal and relational. The analyses will evaluate (1) changes in political behaviors from students’ freshmen to senior years and (2) the relationship between political behaviors and campus experiences.  Variables Dependent variables will look at two individual means of understanding political behaviors: political views and acts of political participation (Table 1.1).

Political Views (PV): Variables describe how students characterize their political views both generally and in response to issue statements. The statement variables focus on topics relating to racial and ethnic identity. 2. Political Participation (PP): Variables include both electoral and non-electoral activities, given the availability of non-electoral activities to students and the fact that respondents may be structurally restricted from electoral activities given age or citizenship status.  Independent variables capture four aspects of campus experiences that could potentially impact an individual’s political behaviors. These variable groups are Campus Activities, Ethnic Exposure, Negative Identity, and Perceptions (Table 1.2). 26  TABLE 1.2 Campus Experiences: Independent Variable Group Breakdown IV Group Variable Descriptions Campus Activities: Activities available on campus that expose students to new ideas and experiences related to identity.

See: Limitations.  The longitudinal study aims to understand how an individual’s political views and levels of political participation have changed from their first to their final year of undergraduate study. These changes are compared by various identity variables assessing acculturation, socioeconomic status, and other social identities (Table 1.3.) Due to changes in survey questions by year, variables used for political views (PV) include the following statements: ● How would you characterize your political views? ● Racial discrimination is no longer a major problem in America. ● Students from disadvantaged social backgrounds should be given preferential treatment in college admissions. ● Colleges should prohibit racist/sexist speech on campus  27  All variables used for political participation are used in the relational study, absent voter registration and voting in national, state, or local elections. This is given that several students enter college before they are of the eligible age to vote. Longitudinal Hypotheses: 1. (PV) Respondents self-report as more left-leaning in their final year of study than in their first year, with the largest growth seen in the “liberal” group.91  a. Greater changes toward the left end of the spectrum occur for students with multiple marginalized identities (i.e. transgender, multiracial, and LGBTQ+).92 2. (PP) Respondent’s political participation has an overall increase between the first and final years of study. a. Greater changes toward increased participation occur among students with multiple marginalized identities (i.e. transgender, multiracial, and LGBTQ+). Hypothesis 1 is predicted based on findings that a majority (two-thirds) or Latinx voters identified or leaned toward the Democratic party between 2008 and 201693 and the unique socialization opportunities available during the college experience. Hypothesis 2 is predicted on the basis that a majority of students are of voting age during their senior year and have access to political organizing opportunities on campus. It will be of interest to see which political activities garner the greatest gains. Research shows that Latinx individuals demonstrate a tendency to participate in non-electoral activities that have greater impacts on their communities.94 Additionally, context often has an impact on whether or not individuals choose to participate in  91 Diemer, M.A. & Rapa, L.J. (2016). 92 Moreau, J., Nuño-Pérez, S., & Sanchez, L.M. (2019). Intersectionality, Linked Fate, and LGBTQ Latinx Political Participation.

(2006). 28  certain activities.95 For example, protests create many potential risks for minority participants.96 Both hypotheses predict that these changes will be most evident for students with multiple marginalized identities (i.e. transgender, LGBTQ+, and multiracial). This is based on the theory that individuals with these intersectional identities often feel connections to both or multiple communities. Resultantly, they are more likely to engage in conversations or activities related to these communities than those without intersectional identities. These are all factors that will be considered in the data analysis. Methods and Hypotheses: Relational  The relational study will evaluate the relationship between four aspects of campus experiences (independent variable groups) and political behaviors. The analysis is conducted through a multivariate linear regression, running each model with the inclusion of an independent variable group, the respective dependent variables, and additional controls.97  Relational Hypotheses: 1. (PV) Exposure to other identities (Ethnic Exposure) and reported negative experiences based on identity (Negative Identity) have significant positive effects on general political views and opinions of racial discrimination than other variable groups. 2.  (PP) Participation in identity-based activities (Campus Activities) and negative experiences (Negative Identity) have significant positive effects on political participation. Hypothesis 1 holds that Ethnic Exposure and Negative Identity will have strong positive relationships with PV variables because these experiences expose students to other identities and information on larger political or racial issues. With Negative Identity, specifically for those who  95 Perrin, A.J. (2005). Political Microculture: Liking Civic Life and Democratic Discourse.

This is based on research showing that marginalized students are more likely to have passionate and informed views on social justice issues.98 Although it is not predicted that Campus Activities will have the strongest positive relationship with political views, it is expected that it will have a positive relationship nonetheless. It is likely that by participating in identity-based activities such as cultural awareness workshops or ethnic/racial student organizations, students are learning more about identity and structural inequalities against ethnic minorities.99 This, in turn, may make them more likely to hold views critical of those inequalities and the systems that hold them in place.  Hypothesis 2 predicts that Campus Activities will have a stronger positive relationship because these activities likely educate students and produce higher rates of engagement.100 The hypothesis predicts that Negative Identity will have a large impact based on links between discrimination and civic activism and historic evidence of collective action resulting from anti-Latinx discrimination.101 It is not expected that the mentioned independent variable groups will be the only groups to have positive effects on political behaviors. Rather, it is expected that these groups will have the most significant and greatest effects.  Limitations  There are some limitations present in the data. Understanding a diverse and dynamic population like the Latinx community requires analysis into differences based on national origin groups. In the survey data, students were only able to identify themselves as  98 Wray-Lake, L. et. al. (2018). 99 Diemer, M.A. & Rapa, L.J. (2016). 100 Diemer, M.A. & Rapa, L.J. (2016). 101 Chan, W.Y. & Latzman, R.D. (2014). 30  \"Mexican/Chicano,\" \"Puerto Rican,\" or \"Other Latino.\" Due to the overlap between variables and small sample sizes for specific national origin groups, it is essential to look at Latinx students as one pan-ethnic group. Small sample sizes also impact identity variables. Of surveyed students, only two within the Latinx population identified as Transgender and 1.5% attended public universities.102 While both variables described major points of interest in terms of identity and campus experience, they will not be considered major variables in this study, but some observations will be included. In terms of institutions, the analyses will instead focus on the variable “Institution Control,” which describes schools in the general terms of “public” or “private” with no distinction between universities and 4-year colleges. The citizenship status variable is intended to assess differences in acculturation and immigrant experiences. However, this variable allows students to describe if they are either U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or \"neither.\" The choice of \"neither\" shows that some respondents in the population could be international students, creating a skew toward international students rather than undocumented students, for example. The final limitation lies within the variable used to assess Financial Aid. In the survey, students were asked to include roughly the total amount of dollars they received from various sources to pay for schooling.103 The amount that students received from family resources was used to create the best measure of a student’s socioeconomic status and to account for differences between tuition costs.      102 Public universities was one of many options describing the “Institution Type” i.e. Public University, Private University, Public 4-year College, Private 4-year College, Catholic 4-year College. 103 Variables included: Family Resources, Own Resources, Aid that does not need to be repaid (grants, scholarships, etc.) and Aid that must be repaid (loans, etc.).  31  Preliminary Analyses  Explanatory Variables Table 2.1 Race/Ethnicity of Survey Population Race/Ethnicity Group       American Indian 0.10%      Asian 8      Black 3      Hispanic 4.5      White 75.1      Other 0.9      Two or more race/ethnicity 8.4 Are you: ______       White/Caucasian 82.80%      African American/Black 4.5      American Indian/Alaska Native 1      East Asian (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese) 6.7      Filipino 1.6      Southeast Asian (e.g., Cambodian, Vietnamese, Hmong) 0.9      South Asian (e.g., Indian, Pakistani, Nepalese, Sri Lankan) 1.8      Other Asian 0.4      Mexican/Chicano 3.5      Puerto Rican 1.5      Other Latino 4      Other 1.8 Do you identify as multiracial?

For example, respondents who marked themselves as either Mexican/Chicano, Puerto Rican, or Other Latino were also coded as Hispanic. However, this did not allow for overlap between ethnicities or between racial groups. Given the diverse nature of the Latinx population, the analyses will focus on all individuals identifying their ethnicity as Mexican/Chicano, Puerto  104 For frequencies within full-time enrolled Latinx students, see Crosstabs.  32  Rican, or Other Latino then coded into the pan-ethnic label “Latinx.” Of the total population, 4.5% of respondents identify as Latinx versus 75.1% identify as White.105  Table 2.2 Social Identity of Survey Population  Table 2.3 Financial Aid of Survey Population Multiracial 10.60%  None 12% Female 63.60%  $1 to $5,999 20 Transgender 0.40%  $6,000 to $14,999 18.9 Sexual Orientation   $15,000 or more 49.1      Heterosexual/Straight 90.90%  Total N 10951      Gay 1.5  Source: 2016 The College Senior Survey (CSS)      Lesbian 0.8         Bisexual 3.4         Queer 1.7         Other 1.7    English as native language 93.50%    Citizenship Status          Permanent resident (green card) 1.40%         U.S. citizen 95.9         Neither 2.7    Total N 10951    Source: 2016 The College Senior Survey (CSS)      Table 2.2 shows that the total population is heavily skewed toward students who are U.S. citizens and speak English as their native language. The survey population is also a majority female (63.3%) and non-multiracial (89.4%). As mentioned prior, the percentage of respondents who identify as transgender is extremely small. The population is also skewed toward those who identify as heterosexual or straight (90.9% of respondents). Table 2.3 shows that using family resources as a determinant for socioeconomic status, about 49% of the total survey population reported receiving $15,000 or more from their family for tuition and living payments.      105 Throughout the survey, the term “Hispanic” is used to describe Latinx students.  33   Table 2.4 Institution Descriptives  Institution's sex       Male only 0.80%      Female only 1.2      Co-ed 98 Private 96.60% Institution Type       Public Universities 1.50%      Private Universities 14.1      Public 4yr Colleges 1.9      Nonsectarian 4yr Colleges 26.7      Catholic 4yr Colleges 36.7      Other Religious 4yr Colleges 19.1 Institution region       West 21.80%      Midwest 17.8      South 9.2      Northeast 51.1 Institution regional division       West - Pacific 20.30%      West - Mountain 1.5      Midwest - West North Central 6.2      Midwest - North Central 11.6      South - West South Central 1.7      South - East South Central 2.6      South - South Atlantic 5      Northeast - Middle Atlantic 34.5      Northeast - New England 16.6 Total N 10951 Source: 2016 The College Senior Survey (CSS)  The data is skewed toward private co-ed institutions; both variables report over 95% (Table 2.4).

Of Campus Activities, students reported taking ethnic studies courses and having roommates of different ethnicities at about the same rate, 54.2% and 54% respectively. Additionally, almost 42% of students reported having attended cultural awareness workshops. With Ethnic Exposure and Negative Identity, it is important to note that on average, students reported having more interactions with other 35  ethnicities and having negative experiences.106 This may likely look different among the isolated full-time Latinx population. Otherwise, all means across Perceptions described students as typically disagreeing with statements regarding racial tension and stereotypes on campus. Students reported an average of 3.14 (agree) when asked if they feel a sense of belonging on campus.  Summary Statistics TABLE 2.6 Summary Statistics, Political Views      Mean (Std.

Latinx students are about half multiracial and show greater diversity than white students in terms of sexual orientation, English as a native language and citizenship status. All which are likely due to different factors of acculturation among Latinx individuals. Latinx students also receive less financial aid from their families than white students (29.8% versus 51.7%). In terms of overlap with other ethnic identities, Latinx students have a slightly greater proportion of their population as showing overlap with non-Latinx identities. While a large portion of the Latinx population identifies as either Mexican/Chicano (40.7%) or Other Latino (48.6%), it should also be noted that 41.4% of Latinx students identify their ethnicity as white as well, again showing overlap among ethnic groups.

Latinx students are also more liberal on specific viewpoints, especially those related to students from disadvantaged social backgrounds and racial discrimination.

Full-time white students were used as a comparison group when necessary. In the survey students were asked about their political views, allowing them to characterize themselves as either far right, conservative, middle of the road, liberal, or far left. Students were also asked to rank whether or not they agreed with specific issue statements, using the scale of strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree. The statements chosen for this analysis all relate to students’ ethnic identities: ● Racial discrimination is no longer a major problem in America. ● Students from disadvantaged social backgrounds should be given preferential treatment in college admissions. ● Colleges should prohibit racist/sexist speech on campus.  To see how much political views changed within the sample populations, this study calculated the percent change between the TFS and CSS means. Further understanding of these changes derived from the overall distribution across political characterizations within the variables. Issue statements were also evaluated using percent change between means for TFS and CSS variables. Procedure – Political Participation Four non-electoral variables were used to assess political participation in the study. The analysis omitted voter registration and voting in national/state/local elections because some students begin college earlier than the age of 18 and would be excluded from the analysis. This is intended to provide an insight into the overall political engagement of students leading into the relational study. Students ranked how often they engaged in activities throughout college by not at all, occasionally, or frequently. The variables used for this portion include: ● Demonstrated for a cause (e.g. boycott, rally, protest) ● Helped raise money for a cause 40  ● Publicly communicated my opinion about a cause (e.g. blog, email, petition) ● Worked on a local, state, or national political campaign Exactly as changing PV was conducted, changing levels of political participation were calculated by percent change between the means for both TFS and CSS variables.  In this portion of the study, all percent changes greater than 10% were the main focus of analysis, with the addition of changes and means that were thought to be interesting points of discussion. Results – Political Views  Hypothesis 1 predicted that respondents will self-report as more left-leaning in their final year of study, with the largest growth seen in the “liberal” group, especially for students with multiple marginalized identities. Overall, the results show that on average, Latinx students lean further toward the left and demonstrate greater percent changes toward those ideologies than white students. For issue statements, Latinx students more often report disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with the racial discrimination statement. Latinx students also begin their freshmen years with higher averages of supporting affirmative action ideas.111 TABLE 3.1 Political Views, TFS v.

White respondents have been included as a reference. In terms of population distribution, Latinx students show a greater overall shift toward characterizing themselves as liberal or far left, with many leaving the characterization of middle of the road. In Table 3.2, the general Latinx student population, on average, shifts toward disagreeing with the statement that racial discrimination is no longer a major problem in America and increasingly agrees with affirmative action policies. It is important to consider that when comparing the outcomes of Latinx students to white students, Latinx freshmen begin as leaning toward disagreeing with the racial discrimination statement more than white freshmen (average of 1.75 versus 1.91).112  112 For a detailed breakdown of Latinx national origin groups and percent changes see Appendix B.   42  TABLE 3.3 Political Views, TFS v.

Latinx non-citizens and Latinx citizens have very similar means for TFS responses (3.16 and 3.19), but Latinx non-citizens have a 17% increase toward liberal political views while Latinx citizens only have 8%. In terms of issue statements, both Latinx and white citizens are reflective of their respective general populations. Interestingly, for both TFS and CSS responses, Latinx citizens report means leaning further toward disagreeing with the racial discrimination statement than do non-citizens, despite both showing similar percent decreases.

Latinx women also express more traditionally left views on issue statements compared to their counterparts. On the issue of racial discrimination both Latinx men and women shift their responses toward strongly disagree (Table 3.6). However, Latinx men had a -6% change while Latinx women had a -21% change, despite both starting between means of 1.7-1.8. The views of Latinx women also better reflect the views of the general Latinx student population, showing the skew in the sample.  45  TABLE 3.7 Political Views, TFS v. CSS (Financial Aid/Family Resources)     Differences in political views are also present between different levels of financial aid from family resources. In both TFS and CSS years, Latinx students receiving $15,000 or more from family resources are less liberal than Latinx students receiving less (Table 3.7).113 For students receiving $15,000 or more from family resources, 33.6% identify as liberal and 20.4% identify as conservative. Meanwhile, 48.1% of students receiving $1 to $5,999 identify as liberal and 11.1% identify as conservative. The same left-lean among students receiving less aid from their families applies to issue statements.      113 Table 3.7 shows students who receive $15,000 or more and those who receive between $1 and $5,999 from family resources. For a full breakdown of political views by financial aid, see Appendix B – Table B.5  46  TABLE 3.8 Political Views, TFS v. CSS (Multiracial)      An interesting finding in the data shows that between white students, those who identify as multiracial begin and end as more liberal than those who are not multiracial. However, between Latinx students who are multiracial and not, the same does not apply (Table 3.8). Here we see that compared to non-multiracial students, a greater number of multiracial Latinx students identify as conservative, and a smaller percentage identify as liberal. Here, it would be interesting to see a more detailed breakdown of multiracial identities.   The transgender sample size is too small to make confident conclusions about political behaviors.114 It should be noted, however, that within Latinx transgender students, the distribution of political views changed from 50% conservative and 50% middle of the road in TFS to 50% conservative and 50% far left in CSS. While this is likely the result of an isolated  114 The sample size for Latinx students identifying as transgender was limited to less than 5, all within the Mexican/Chicano population. 47  event for one student, it is important to take note of how drastically an individual’s views can change over time. The problem of a small sample size arises again in our institution control variable, showing the skew toward private universities. TABLE 3.9 Political Views, TFS v.

Non-native speakers have a majority (roughly 64%) reporting as 48  either liberal or far left. Native speakers have about 46% of respondents who fall into these categories. The same patterns are repeated with issue statements, with more non-native speakers reporting a lower mean for the racial discrimination statement and a higher mean for the affirmative action statement (Table 3.10).

For the issue statement regarding prohibiting racist or sexist speech on college campuses, most groups with sufficient population sizes show a negative or 0% change in means, meaning that they increasingly disagree in prohibiting such speech. For students identifying as LGBTQ+, both white and Latinx students shift toward supporting the prohibition of such speech, although only by 3% and 5%, respectively. LGBTQ+ students also report as much more left-leaning than non-LGBTQ+ counterparts. Interestingly, white and Latinx LGBTQ+ students report similar means for both survey years. In terms of distribution, both populations have a majority of about 75% identifying as liberal or far left. These students increasingly believe racial discrimination is a problem and support affirmative action policies.    LGBTQ+ students show the greatest changes toward left-leaning stances. In almost all cases, the various groups of Latinx students show shifts toward disagreeing that colleges should prohibit racist or sexist speech on campus. Additionally, variable groups that are overall more left-leaning and show greater percent changes, were the same groups to increasingly disagree with the racial discrimination statement and to agree with the affirmative action statement. Overall, students with multiple identities i.e. women, students that received less aid from family resources, and non-native English speakers, demonstrate more liberal views and greater shifts toward these views throughout college. Further analysis conducted in the relational study will shed light on potential reasons for this behavior. This shows that the hypotheses predicting that these groups would show more left-leaning behaviors are correct. However, it did not apply to all predicted identities, as seen with multiracial Latinx students. Overall, the hypotheses were correct in showing that Latinx students ended college with more liberal stances.   50  Results – Political Participation  TABLE 3.13 Political Participation, TFS v.

The largest and most consistent increases in the analyses are for publicly communicating about a cause. Assumingly, this falls in line with the practices of students to engage in non-electoral activities that are available to them through social media. Significant changes are also present in demonstrating for a cause. In the general analysis (Table 3.13), demonstrating for a cause rose among Latinx students but fell for white students; both groups show increases in publicly communicating for a cause. Latinx students have higher overall means across all forms of engagement, but typically by about 0.1. TABLE 3.14 Political Participation, TFS v.

Publicly communicating is consistent among all three statuses, with the overall CSS for Latinx students falling between the range of 1.83 to 1.89. Latinx permanent residents have a 20% increase in demonstrating for a cause, which is large when compared to Latinx non-citizen and citizen counterparts (-1% and 3%) as well as white permanent residents.

However, differences between Latinx men and women do not differ by much. Latinx males' rates of helping raise money for a campaign increased by 11% (from 1.6 to 1.77) while Latinx females’ rates decreased by 5% (1.89 to 1.8). Although they ended in similar averages, it should be accounted for that male engagement in this specific activity shows an overall increase.   115 For a full breakdown of Latinx ethnic identities, see Appendix B – Table B.12  52  TABLE 3.16 Political Participation, TFS v.

Here, although the percent change is under 10%, demonstrating for a cause has the greatest change for the Western region and its mean is higher than any other. National origin group differences show that demonstrating for a cause has the greatest change for each Latinx national origin group: Mexican/Chicano at 8%, Puerto Rican at 17%, and Other Latinx at 12%.116 It is also important to note that white student engagement in demonstrating for a cause has a 0% change.   116 See Appendix B – Table B.14 53  TABLE 3.17 Political Participation, TFS v.

For all other activities, Latinx students receiving none to $5,999 from family resources have the highest means, with the greatest overall increase occurring for Latinx students receiving $1 to $5,999 in publicly communicating for a cause. It is also interesting to note that across activities other than publicly communicating for a cause, white students have almost identical means across financial aid differences. The greatest differences within a variable group are between white and Latinx students who receive no financial aid from their families. In demonstrating for a cause, white students report a 1.29 average and Latinx students report a 1.56 average.  54  TABLE 3.18 Political Participation, TFS v.

Across all activities, multiracial Latinx students have the highest means for involvement. The issue with sample size and large skews in the data impacted analyses of political participation as well. Again, the transgender population is too small to make confident conclusions on the results. The skew toward private institutions is also present. However, it should be highlighted that Latinx students at public institutions show greater means and greatest increases for all political activities (i.e. a 34% increase in demonstrating for a cause).117 TABLE 3.19 Political Participation, TFS v.

Non-native and native English speakers report similar averages for publicly communicating and helping to raise money for a campaign (Table 3.19). The biggest difference between the groups is in demonstrating for a cause. TABLE 3.20 Political Participation, TFS v.

The greatest differences between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ students occur within demonstrating for a cause. LGBTQ+ students show a CSS mean of 1.81 with a 15% increase while non-LGBTQ+ students have a 1.38 mean with a 1% increase.  Latinx students of lower socioeconomic statuses, meaning those who receive none to about $5,999 of aid from their families, show high average levels of political participation than white students of the same status. Less accultured individuals have higher levels of political participation as well, specifically for publicly communicating and demonstrating for a cause. This applies to both non-native English speakers and permanent residents. Overall, political participation increased among students with multiple marginalized identities versus those without. This is especially true among LGBTQ+ identities, and students who are multiracial, less accultured and low income. Thus, proving the hypothesis correct. 56  Discussion  The longitudinal studies show that political behaviors do indeed change over a student's time in undergraduate study. Political views shift toward the left and levels of political participation increase. Within both political views and political participation, some identities show significant changes. Those identities being less accultured individuals, LGBTQ+ students, and low-income students. Of the political participation variables used, publicly communicating for a cause shows the greatest increase and is most popular among students, followed by demonstrating for a cause. This shows that students may opt for more readily available opportunities, especially as students can engage in conversations about these issues via social media and other popular outlets. The increase in demonstrating for a cause may also show the relevance of certain hot button issues in the news during this period.    To contextualize the results of this study, it is necessary to look at results of interest: an increase in demonstrating for a cause and the high levels of engagement among LGBTQ+ individuals. A news search of Latinx demonstrations and protests in Western states during the survey period shows many relevant issues prevalent in the media. Namely, the issue of police brutality following the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. During this period the Black Lives Matter movement evolved from social media and protests filled streets throughout U.S. cities.118 Several demonstrations also took place in the Los Angeles area and in Central California,119 many of which were focused on police killings of unarmed Latinx individuals.120 These protests occurred before 2014 as well, such as the case with the fatal shooting of a Latinx  118 Southall, A.

During the time that respondents were enrolled in undergraduate study, the Supreme Court ruled on Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), making same-sex marriage legal in the U.S.123 While it is not intended that this explains the results in its entirety, it is important to contextualize events that may have influenced students' behaviors during this time. Overall, the hypotheses which generalized that students' political behaviors would shift toward the left and increase prove correct. Additionally, the greatest changes in and the greatest means of political engagement are present in students with multiple marginalized identities. The findings from this portion of the study will inform the control variable choices and be expanded upon in the relational portion.     121 Marosi, R. (2012, October 4).

To investigate the relationship between student experiences and political behaviors, the system ran hierarchical multivariate linear regressions by independent variable group. Dependent variables were split into the same categories used prior: Political Views (PV) and Political Participation (PP). Independent variables were split into four groups: Campus Activities, Ethnic Exposure, Negative, and Perceptions. Controls in the regressions have been chosen based on findings in the longitudinal study. The control variables include citizenship status and English as a native language to account for acculturation, financial aid (family resources) for socioeconomic status, and LGBTQ+ given its results in the prior portion of the study. In PP regressions for whether or not a student voted in recent elections, voter registration is included as a control given registration requirements to vote. No independent variables from the same group exceed a correlation of 6.96.124 In each regression, the first model is limited to control variables while the second model introduces all other independent variables of interest.  Results – Political Views The hypotheses predicted that concerning political views, Ethnic Exposure and Negative identity would have a stronger positive relationship with general political views and the issue statement on racial discrimination than other variable groups. In the analysis, independent variable groups with the greatest frequency of significance include Campus Activities and Perceptions. Meanwhile, Ethnic Exposure variables have little significance with political views.    124 See Appendix C – Tables C.1 – C.4. 59  TABLE 4.1 Political Views Regressed by Campus Activities   Model 1: Control Variables Model II: Campus Activities How would you characterize your political views?

Each outcome listed shows at least a 0.05 significance. Among political views, the most significant variables were LGBTQ+, attending a racial/cultural awareness workshop, and participating in an ethnic or racial student organization. Of this group, students attending cultural awareness workshops are more likely to have left-leaning ideologies by 19.1%, LGBTQ+ by 17% and students who participate in ethnic/racial student groups by 16.5%. Native English speakers are also less likely to lean left than non-native speakers, whose coefficient is 0.111. Attending a cultural awareness workshop makes students 2% less likely to disagree with the 60  racial discrimination statement and 15% more likely to agree with affirmative action policies. Negative effects on the racial discrimination statement are also seen among women (-0.16), LGBTQ+ students (-0.1), and students who had roommates of a different ethnicity during college (-0.76). In terms of speech prohibition on campus, only the respondent's sex and performing community service are statistically significant. Sex has a 0.00 significance, showing that Latinx women would be 18.9% more likely to agree with prohibiting racist or sexist speech.

Of the final regressions, only twice does an Ethnic Exposure variable show significance. Significant variables in Model II for each regression are mostly constant variables. Having a meaningful or honest conversation with other students about race or ethnic relations has a statistically significant positive effect on political views, making students who more often have 61  these conversations about 12.7% more likely to shift left on the political spectrum. Dining or sharing a meal with students of other ethnicities has a positive effect on the racist/sexist speech prohibition issue statement. It should be noted that although Ethnic Exposure variables do not have statistically significant effects, other important variables do. LGBTQ+ is significant in three-fourths of the regressions and English as a native language has a significant effect on each of the four political views variables.

Of the variables, feeling discriminated against because of social 62  identity is most prevalent. The variable has similar positive effects on political views (0.169) and the affirmative action issue statement (0.166). Students who report having guarded, cautious interactions with other ethnicities are also about 14.8% more likely to agree in affirmative action policies.

Students who more often report feeling racial 63  tension on campus are 22.5% more likely to lean left on the political spectrum, 9.7% less likely to agree with the racial discrimination statement, and 24.6% more likely to agree with affirmative action ideas. Students who are satisfied with the diversity of students show greater opposite effects, as they are 25% less likely to have liberal ideas, 22.4% more likely to agree with the discrimination statement, and 23% less likely to agree with affirmative action policies. Students’ increased satisfaction with the respect for beliefs on campus has similar, but not as great, effects on political views and the affirmative action issue statement as does the perception of racial tension. Of PV variables, the issue statement on the prohibition of racist/sexist speech shows no significant relationships with Perceptions variables. Exposure to other identities has little effect on students' political views proving this portion of the hypothesis as incorrect. Students with negative experiences related to identity demonstrate stronger positive relationships, showing a shift toward left-leaning ideas among students with these experiences, thus proving part of the hypothesis correct. However, there is no significance between negative experiences and the issue statement on racial discrimination. Campus Activities and Perceptions have greater frequencies in significant relationships. This might suggest that students' perceptions of campus and their campus involvement has a greater influence on political views. Variables representing multiple marginalized identities also have significant effects on racial discrimination opinions. In models for all four IV groups, the respondent's sex and LGBTQ+ identity are significant. This shows that those who identify as LGBTQ+ or female report more left-leaning ideologies whereas more accultured individuals (native English speakers) report more right-leaning ideologies.   The models provide two major takeaways that drift from the original hypothesis: the impact of campus activities and perceptions of campus on students' political views. Among campus activities, attending a racial/cultural awareness workshop or participating in an 64  ethnic/racial student group are most impactful on political views. Students who partake in these activities demonstrate more left-leaning stances in general and on issue statements. In terms of perceptions of campus, the models show that some students identify issues of racial tension or dissatisfaction with respect for the diversity of the student body at their respective institutions. These students, who are more critical of their schools, are those who still view discrimination as a major problem in America.  Results – Political Participation  The hypotheses predicted that Campus Activities and Negative Identity variables would have stronger positive relationships with political participation. As expected, the data shows that voter registration and voting in an election are necessary control variables for the first two dependent variables, as both have a significance of 0.00. Voter registration is dependent on a student’s citizenship status and voting in an election is dependent on both citizenship status and voter registration. Similar to the PV analysis, Ethnic Exposure has the least frequency in significant relationships out of all independent variable groups. However, different from PV, Negative Identity plays a larger role in political participation.          65  TABLE 4.5 Political Participation Regressed by Campus Activities    Model 1: Control Variables Model II: Campus Activities Registered to vote     U.S. Citizen -0.347** -0.39** Taken a women's studies course -- 0.072* Attended a racial/cultural awareness workshop -- 0.129** Adjusted R Squared 0.104 0.124 Voted in national/state/local election     U.S. Citizen 0.344** 0.341** Registered to vote 0.392** 0.388** Taken an ethnic studies course -- 0.068* Taken a women's studies course -- -0.074* Adjusted R Squared 0.197 0.208 Worked on a campaign     Participated in an LGBTQ student organization -- 0.181** Adjusted R Squared -0.001 0.047 Demonstrated for a cause     Native English-speaker -0.098*  Aid from Family resources -0.088*  Identifies as LGBTQ+ 0.226** 0.113** Performed community service as part of a class -- 0.159** Taken a women's studies course -- 0.076* Attended a racial/cultural awareness workshop -- 0.118** Participated in an ethnic/racial student organization -- 0.181** Participated in an LGBTQ student organization -- 0.216** Adjusted R Squared 0.068 0.248 Helped raise money for a cause or campaign     Performed community service as part of a class -- 0.257** Had a roommate of a different race/ethnicity -- 0.089* Adjusted R Squared -0.006 0.102 Publicly communicated your opinion about a cause     Identifies as LGBTQ+ 0.125**  Performed community service as part of a class -- 0.275** Participated in an LGBTQ student organization -- 0.177** Adjusted R Squared 0.013 0.158 Significance **p<0.01, *p<0.05     Values shown are standardized beta coefficients Source: 2016 The College Senior Survey (CSS)   Participating in an LGBTQ student organization and taking a women's studies course both have significant effects on political participation variables (Table 4.5). However, each dependent variable shows to be impacted by its unique grouping of independent variables. For example, we see that attending a racial awareness workshop or taking a women's studies course positively affects voter registration. Whereas only participating in an LGBTQ organization has a significant positive effect on working for a campaign. Interestingly for voter registration, significant variables are those which might offer direct opportunities to register to vote given the 66  civic nature of such activities. The same, however, does not apply to whether or not a student votes. Taking an ethnic studies course makes a student about 6.8% more likely to vote whereas taking a women's studies courses shows an effect of -7.4%. Of the seven independent variables, five have statistically significant relationships with demonstrating for a cause. Among these, three show a significance of 0.00 and each with high beta coefficients. Performing community service has a 15.9% effect, participating in an ethnic or racial student group has an 18.1% effect, and participating in an LGBTQ organization has a 21.6% effect. Performing community service also shows large positive effects on raising money and publicly communicating for a cause with coefficients of 0.257 and 0.275, respectively. Participating in an LGBTQ organization makes students 17.7% more likely to publicly communicate for a cause.

None of these variables have significant effects on voter registration, voting in an election, or raising money for a cause of campaign. Among all variables, having a meaningful and honest about race relations outside of class shows the largest effects, making students 13.8% more likely to demonstrate for a cause and 18% more likely to publicly communicate for a cause. Interestingly, sharing personal feelings with students of other ethnicities makes individuals about 14.1% less likely to work for a campaign.

Negative Identity variables show large significant effects on each of the political participation variables except raising money for a campaign, which shows no significant relationships (Table 4.7). Feeling insulted or threatened because of race or ethnicity shows a significant effect on each activity. This experience makes students about 17% more likely to work for a campaign or publicly communicate for a cause and 18.3% more likely to vote in an election. The greatest impact is within demonstrating for a cause, in which feeling discriminated against because of social identity shows a 0.00 significance, making students almost 25% more likely to demonstrate for a cause, showing the significance of racial threat and protesting.   69   TABLE 4.8 Political Participation Regressed by Perceptions    Model 1: Control Variables Model II: Campus Activities Registered to vote     U.S. Citizen -0.347** -0.344** In class, I have heard faculty express stereotypes based on race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, or religious affiliation -- 0.103** Adjusted R Squared 0.104 0.112 Voted in national/state/local election     U.S. Citizen 0.344** 0.342** Registered to vote 0.392** 0.39** Adjusted R Squared 0.196 0.194 Worked on a campaign     There is a lot of racial tension on this campus -- 0.148** In class, I have heard faculty express stereotypes based on race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, or religious affiliation -- 0.113** Adjusted R Squared -0.002 0.035 Demonstrated for a cause     Native English-speaker -0.098*  Aid from Family Resources -0.088*  Identifies as LGBTQ+ 0.226** 0.16** Campus Satisfaction: Racial/ethnic diversity of the student body -- -0.109* There is a lot of racial tension on this campus -- 0.274** In class, I have heard faculty express stereotypes based on race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, or religious affiliation -- 0.126** Adjusted R Squared 0.068 0.212 Helped raise money for a cause or campaign     There is a lot of racial tension on this campus -- 0.106* In class, I have heard faculty express stereotypes based on race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, or religious affiliation -- 0.212** I feel a sense of belonging to this campus -- 0.199** Adjusted R Squared -0.006 0.081 Publicly communicated your opinion about a cause     Identifies as LGBTQ+ 0.125** 0.087* There is a lot of racial tension on this campus -- 0.154** In class, I have heard faculty express stereotypes based on race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, or religious affiliation -- 0.18** I feel a sense of belonging to this campus -- 0.088* Adjusted R Squared 0.013 0.077 Significance **p<0.01, *p<0.05     Values shown are standardized beta coefficients     Source: 2016 The College Senior Survey (CSS)     Perceptions surprisingly show many significant effects on political participation, many of which were significant at 0.00. Again, the feeling that there is racial tension on campus showed significant positive effects on the dependent variables. Racial tension makes students 14.8% more likely to work on a campaign, 10.6% more likely to help raise money, 15.4% more likely to publicly communicate for a cause and most of all, 27.4% more likely to demonstrate for a cause. The experience of hearing faculty express stereotypes based on social identity also shows 70  significant effects across almost all variables but voting in an election. The largest impacts are seen with helping to raise money (0.199) and publicly communicating for a cause (0.18). Satisfaction with the ethnic and racial diversity of the study body shows a negative effect, with a coefficient of -0.109 with demonstrating for a cause.     Extracurricular experiences and negative experiences related to identity both show stronger positive relationships with political participation variables, proving the general hypothesis as correct. Student engagement in identity organizations and negative interactions gave way to student engagement via publicly communicating and demonstrating for a cause. LGBTQ+ and ethnic/racial student organizations show the most significant relationships and greatest frequency among variable groups. Within Negative Identity variables, feeling insulted or threatened is most frequent and shows the greatest beta coefficients. Feeling discriminated against shows the greatest impact, with a coefficient of almost 0.25. Perceptions also have strong relationships with higher levels of engagement. Students who express more critical and dissatisfied views of their campus experiences demonstrate higher levels of non-electoral forms of participation. As mentioned earlier, non-electoral activities overall have greater frequencies total in statistically significant relationships with independent variables groups than do electoral activities. Within analyses of electoral activities, whether or not a student is registered to vote is most influenced by Campus Activities variables. Students who attend a racial or cultural awareness workshop or take a women’s studies course are also those who are more likely to be registered, with all controls remaining the same. This suggests that these activities either offer opportunities for students to register to vote or that they may be in environments where voter engagement is encouraged.   71  Discussion  Relational hypotheses were, for the most part, proved correct but with some nuances. First is the role of multiple marginalized identities (considered in addition to being Latinx) in political behaviors. Throughout the models in both PV and PP analyses, identities of LGBTQ+, English as a native language, and sex repeatedly show as significant. This shows that individuals who identify as LGBTQ+, do not speak English as their native language (meaning that they may be less accultured), and identify as female report greater shifts toward left-leaning ideas and greater levels of political participation. As Wray-Lake points out, it may be that these students have unique experiences of marginalization when compared to Latinx students without intersectional identities. As a result, students might empower themselves through information and activism within social justice which would explain increases in political behaviors.125  It is important to also consider and recognize preexisting research on LGBTQ+ individuals. Certain studies have found that individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ are, on average, more likely to participate in political activities due to concepts of intersectionality and feeling connections to both LGBTQ+ and Latinx communities.126 LGBTQ+ Latinx individuals have also shown great involvement in movements and organizations. An article focused on the aftermath of the shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida recognized that these individuals advocate for LGBTQ+ organizations to include relevant Latinx issues such as racial inequality, police brutality, and immigration in their programming.127 This may suggest that LGBTQ+ Latinx students also have the potential and motivation to bring issues that relate to both communities into the discourse.  125 Wray-Lake, L. et. al. (2018). 126 Moreau, J., Nuño-Pérez, S., & Sanchez, L.M. (2019). 127 Kline, N. & Cuevas, C. (2018). Resisting Identity Erasure after Pulse: Intersectional LGBTQ+ Latinx Activism in Orlando, FL. Chiricú Journal: Latina/o Literatures, Arts, and Cultures, 2(2). 68-71. https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/chiricu.2.2.06. 72   While it was predicted that perceptions of campus would have a stronger positive relationship with political participation variables, it was nonetheless surprising to see the degree to which perceptions influenced political views and political participation. Feeling that racial tension is present on their campus, being dissatisfied with the diversity of the student body, and hearing faculty express stereotypes based on identity all show significant effects on left-leaning ideologies and increased political engagement. This is even true in raising money for a campaign or cause, which is least impacted by independent variables. Perceptions are especially interesting to consider when comparing the Latinx population to the general survey population. In Table 2.5, the general population, on average, disagreed with perceptions of racial tension on campus and the use of stereotypes. As stated in the longitudinal study, the results might suggest that students who hold these perceptions of campus and who easily identify these issues might also be those who are more likely to engage to change those issues in the world around them.   Perceptions and Campus Activities show greater positive effects on political behaviors than did Negative Identity experiences or Ethnic Exposure. While this may be due to many underlying factors, it is important to consider suggestions from this takeaway. For one, this may suggest that political behaviors among Latinx students are dependent on their predispositions. Does this imply that students who engage in campus activities related to identity become more aware of racial issues and tension on campus which, in turn, impacts their political behaviors? Or does this imply that students who are predisposed to partake in these activities are also those predisposed to be critical of campus and to engage politically? While further research and study would be necessary to understand this relationship, it is important to consider.   Negative experiences related to identity are statistically significant when included in political participation models, but not with political views. This suggests that students who have negative experiences on campus, whether feeling insulted or threatened because of their ethnicity 73  or feeling direct acts of discrimination, may feel motivated by that experience. Or that that experience may make them more aware of wrongdoings and inequalities around them. Thus, this might lead to greater levels of political participation. However, it is interesting to see that while feeling discrimination and having guarded interactions produced changes in political views, namely in generalized views and stances on affirmative action, it was much less impactful than the changes seen with political participation. This may show that student experiences are more likely to have an effect on their political actions rather than political views. The relational study shows that campus experiences, broadly, have significant positive effects on political behaviors. Most important of these behaviors is engagement in campus activities based on identity, perceptions of race and ethnicity on campus, and whether or not students have negative experiences based on their identity.     74  Student Interviews   Fifteen in-person interviews were conducted on the University of Pennsylvania's campus. The interviews were completed to illuminate findings and themes found in the data analysis. Students were chosen via personal networks and expanded by referrals. Students were asked about their identity, experiences with identity on campus, and political behaviors over time. The stories they shared included personal anecdotes of their campus involvement and social interactions. Politically, students expressed a deep passion for a variety of issues and spoke to their varying levels of engagement with the political system.  Experiences on Campus  The relational studies show that exposure to students of other identities has the least impact on political behaviors. Interview students expressed that these interactions were commonplace during a typical day on campus. Students attributed this to social interactions: meeting people through athletic teams, living arrangements, and extracurricular activities. Other students heavily involved in Latinx cultural organizations described being surrounded primarily by people of their own identity. Students expressed feeling that this experience was due to the demographic makeup of Penn. A senior from Houston, Texas described: The demographic makeup of Penn makes it such that my classes are not of people who are Mexican American or Mexican. In classes, depending on the type of class, any type of interaction is anywhere from sitting and being around each other to sustained conversation about readings. I'm in a very diverse set of classes this semester. At work, it's more casual, small talk type of things. With my coworkers, the only common thing we have is that we're all Penn students and everything from there diverges. 75  This might suggest that when exposure to other ethnicities is a natural part of campus, it may become a constant in terms of campus experience. Whereas other experiences, such as engagement in campus activities, may be more dependent on individual campus experiences. Students also group themselves with people who have similar identities in certain scenarios. This is especially that case within majors or in classes where students feel that their identity is underrepresented, examples being STEM and nursing courses. Students also expressed gratitude for the diversity around them. A senior from New York described the insight she has gained from being on a diverse campus:  What I really appreciate about campuses, in general, is that there may be conflicts of identities but I do see that there is a lot of acceptance and at least that openness to learning about different identities. I definitely learned a lot about multiple intersecting identities that I never really considered before. I appreciate that and it's healthy – it may not always be healthy in terms of how people approach it and how they approach conversations with people of different identities. But I do appreciate that if you want to, you can definitely find either centers or people that can teach you about a certain identity.  There was a deep frustration among students who felt that despite the diversity of the campus, they were isolated in their experiences and identity. For many, students felt that the experience of being on campus was one that made their Latinx identity front of mind. A senior from the Bay Area described the feeling that being the only Latina and being Central American made her identity salient in the classroom and ultimately empowered her.   When I came to Penn I realized how much that would make me stick out, especially being in a major like [Biological Basis of Behavior]. I found myself being and am the only Latina in my classes. My first two years I very much shied away from that 76  and was just like, “I’m here to get my degree whatever.” My junior year I was like, “You know what? No.” The things that were happening to me were just not okay and I was the token Latina way too many times. I was just like this is enough so I used it to my advantage instead of shying away from that part of my identity. Students also described that certain spaces influenced their level of comfort in expressing their ethnic identity, varying from the classroom to more social settings. A senior in the Nursing school spoke on the influence of context on her experience: My nursing cohort, in general, is not very diverse and people come from very different backgrounds so sometimes I feel like no one would relate to certain things or I don't open up as much. Whereas in a club or something with people of similar cultural or racial backgrounds I feel more comfortable talking about those things. Most of all, students felt frustrated with the lack of Latinx representation in school faculty and overall academic settings. Participants spoke to the fact that issues discussed in class that pertained to them and their identities were never truly addressed in relevant classes. Even more so, students felt that they had been excluded and talked over in several academic settings. A senior from New Jersey spoke on her experience with the issue: I took a populations and society class last semester – a lot of times the professor brought up some pretty controversial topics like, \"What is race,\" \"Can we switch races if we wanted to.\" The class was largely white, to be blatant. I felt like my voice was already kind of different. The experiences of others, as opposed to minority people engaging in a conversation about race, is just so hard to navigate. In that space, I just felt uncomfortable voicing my opinion because I felt outnumbered. There have been other social settings where, you know, I just feel 77  like I can’t interact necessarily with people of a certain race because they may have certain ideas about me or whatever. Many students who expressed frustration concerning representation were also those who grew up in communities that reflected their own identity. Students came from cities and areas such as Chicago, Texas, New York, and California, where Latinx culture and representation were largely integrated into their surroundings. Students described going to predominantly Latinx high schools and growing up in spaces with people of, if not the same, similar cultural backgrounds. Microaggressions When students were asked if they had encountered any negative experiences based on their ethnic identity, most cited that although they had never experienced “direct forms” of discrimination, that they often experienced microaggressions.128 Most often these were related to personal comments about an individual's appearance or doubting their intelligence. Others included racial jokes or institutional microaggressions creating barriers for Latinx students to feel that they belong on campus. These microaggressions were primarily expressed through off-handed comments made at students that were accompanied by a bevy of assumptions. Students shared that others automatically assumed their parents were undocumented because they were Latinx or that others asserted that a student was Mexican even when the student responded that they were not. Students also demonstrated a deep frustration with instances of colorism, talking about either the privilege they felt in being \"white-passing\" or feeling that they were ignored in social and romantic settings because of how they looked. Most of all, students experienced others making comments directly on their appearance. A senior from the Bay Area described a superior at work touching her hair:  128 Yosso, T.J., Smith, W.A., Ceja, M., & Solórzano, D.G. (2009, December 1). 78  She would come in two or three times a week and she would always comment on my hair. One day I cut all my hair off, I cut like 7 inches off, she comes in and she's like, \"Oh my gosh your hair is so cute\" and she just touches my hair. I'm sitting there and she's petting me like, jaw on the floor, and she walks out and I don't know what to do. The worst part is that has happened to me multiple times before with people who are superior to me, people who are my equals, and I don't know, it's just really uncomfortable and negative. That's what sticks out to me most is just viewing me as a spectacle almost instead of a person because of the way I look. Engagement with the Political System  Of the interviewed students, most were not particularly engaged in the political system. They indicated that they had an interest in certain political issues or that they were only involved in extracurricular clubs. Students also felt a social push to engage, speaking about encouragement to learn more from their friend groups or doing something politically active while being with friends. For example, a freshman from San Antonio talked about texting her friends from home to remind them of the voter registration deadline. Meanwhile, numerous seniors from Houston and Northern California spoke about friends who were involved in local Philadelphia political chapters. They expressed admiration for their friends' involvement, believed in the programming they saw them plan, and even got involved in phone banks or canvassing through those friends.   Even students with minimal engagement described a push to inform themselves on certain issues from either their academic interests or from their friends' involvement. A senior studying environmental studies from New Jersey described her experience with her close friends: My friends are super politically involved. I’ve been learning from them and I tell them – I try to be as honest as possible – “I don’t know anything.” They really try 79  to break it down for me and I’ve been slowly learning but I still feel so set back. My friend is in Penn for Bernie and another is involved with BARS [Beyond Arrest: Re-Thinking Systematic Oppression] so just having those conversations casually over dinner and stuff really kind of teaches me in that moment.  Interviewees, even if they doubted their knowledge about the political system, expressed self-motivation to engage with the subject matter they encountered. Respondents sought out information because of friends or courses, even across a variety of majors. A senior in the nursing school described opportunities to learn about healthcare inequities through academics and hands-on hospital experience. A senior studying environmental studies talked about the inherently political nature of her coursework concerning climate change. Students especially found this motivation as it pertained to their own ethnic identities. A senior from the Bay Area described learning about the history of Guatemala and Nicaragua when her parents immigrated: Both my parents left Central America because of the regional instability tied to the war against communism and how the United States backed these coups against communism. I never got to hear that side from my parents because it was very off-topic, do not touch, subject growing up. Coming here I was like, \"Okay this is a place where I have an opportunity to learn about these things I couldn't learn from my family.\" In my own time, I would research the civil war that happened in Guatemala, the Contra v. Sandinista thing that was going on in Nicaragua when my dad left and I think it gave me a better perspective and better understanding of my parents, definitely. But also, a better understanding of how the political landscape is very much skewed in the United States.  More than anything, students described their efforts in learning about the meaning behind a variety of political buzzwords often thrown around among their age group. Throughout their 80  education, students shared a similar experience of doing their best to educate themselves before entering conversations. A freshman from San Antonio described this experience early in high school: I got very into, “I just discovered feminism I have to get to know everything.” Then I had to tone it down and be like, “Okay you need to know why you’re saying these things and not just say all these words. Don’t throw ‘internalized misogyny’ around just because it sounds cool.” You kind of have to know what it means, so I got into the history of it all.  These responses also provide great insights into findings from the data. Interviewed students expressed interest in learning more about the topics they engaged in and were critical of terminologies and ideas that are often thrown around. This may suggest that when understanding student perceptions of campus and their engagement in campus activities, that certain students do have the internal motivation and a predisposition toward questioning the ideas around them or engaging with others on those topics.  Disillusionment, Change, and Engagement  The students who were interviewed represented a wide range of overall political engagement. Some students had been active in protests and voter registration efforts, some had interned for Members of Congress, while others simply described their engagement only as understanding and discussing the issues with friends. Among surveyed seniors, those who began their undergraduate study in August 2016, many individuals described their initial excitement about the political system when entering college. A majority of these students also described themselves as \"liberal\" or \"left-leaning\" and spoke of their excitement to join get-out-the-vote campaigns or the university's Democratic student organization in support of the presidential election. However, students spoke to an initial fade of that excitement for a variety of reasons. 81  Some felt that their identities were overlooked or underrepresented in their campus political organizations and quit, while others felt that the results of the 2016 election essentially discredited their vote. Lastly, and likely a unique situation for students of this generation, respondents expressed the role that social media played in their engagement and understanding of politics. A majority of students described that they used social media as a means of following and engaging with candidates or elected officials, especially through Twitter. Students also utilized Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter as a means of getting quick news, then later diving into the topics on their own time. Most interestingly, a trend in students' responses showed that social media went beyond initial pieces of news and that it represented something deeper about students' social interactions. For many, social media has been a major factor in fostering a community for students by either sharing petitions and articles on issues relevant to specific subgroups within Latinx communities, or by creating a method for students to identify who did - and who did not - share their political ideas. Students did, however, express frustration in how social media has impacted mainstream politics. A senior from Houston described:  The ways I noticed it starting to come into play after the 2016 election were when Trump’s tweets became a thing. Maybe a year or two ago I started noticing academic articles that were like, “Per the President’s tweets.” Like, oh god, this is horrible! Turning Point: The 2016 Election  The political participation of interviewed students was heavily impacted by the 2016 election. Many interviewed seniors described Trump's election and the experience of it on campus as a turning point. For one, students described the year leading up to November 2016, speaking to the salience of the election and the clear necessity to be engaged at the time. A senior from the Inland Empire, California spoke about her motivation to volunteer for local campaigns 82  toward the end of her senior year in high school. A senior from Burbank, California described the salience of politics for her and her peers at that time:  That was just such a crazy election cycle [2016] with such disparate views that I feel like, even my friends - people who never would've been involved with or thought about politics prior - had started to talk about it… If you didn't know what people were talking about when you came into a room you looked stupid. Students also described how their identities were made salient by the election, especially as they and their families, many of which are immigrants, faced the anti-immigrant rhetoric popularized during that period. The reactions that students described on election night were particularly raw and had resonated with students. As a senior from the Bay Area described: It’s so distinct in my head and I feel like it is for everyone. What the hell happened that day? I remember my dorm having a watch party for the elections. I’m there and seeing how the ballots are coming in and thinking, “It’s red…it’s still red…it’s getting more red. There’s no way this guy’s gonna win, there’s no way this guy’s gonna win.” Then Trump got elected. I was just – I think I went to my room and called my mom. I was talking to my hallmates like, “Is this really happening? Is someone going to pinch me then I’m going to wake up?” The election also created a huge uncertainty for students and their futures. One student, a DACA recipient from New York, described the fear she felt that night, and in response sought out the comfort of the Latinx community:  It was really hard to talk about that part of my identity...I knew there was an event that week and I thought, “I need to go. I just need other Latinas to be there for me even if I don’t talk about it.” I think I cried hearing people’s stories and their experiences. It made me feel at home.  83  Students felt threatened and in turn doubted their place and comfort in both the country and on a predominantly white campus. Students found it to be a complete shock when compared to the political world they grew up in. A senior from Georgia described the election results as depleting the hope she had carried on from growing up \"in the era of Obama.\" Despite the initial fear that the election caused, it also served as a point of change for many. Students realized that there would need to be more change and action no matter the outcome. They described attending the Women's March in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, educated themselves on specific issues and began engaging in deeper conversations with their friends. For many, threats toward identity pushed students to engage beyond what they felt as normal. You can’t just do one thing and hope for the best because there are people out there who are actually paying more attention than you and are going to use your indifference against you.129 Political Views  Interviewed students all described themselves with the range of \"Center-Left\" to \"Leftist,\" likely a result of interviewing on a primarily liberal campus and because students came from their relative referral networks. What stood out more than anything was the range in which students characterized their political views given the aforementioned skew. Some students, namely a junior studying engineering and a senior studying French and Francophone studies, characterized themselves as \"less liberal\" than other students on campus. These comparisons were made namely due to differences they found in how they versus their peers chose to approach certain issues. One senior described how she felt that while she was liberal, she was more open-minded than her peers in wanting to understand the reasoning behind ideas that her friends instantly labeled as racist or offensive.    129 Freshmen from San Antonio, TX 84  Other students expressed that their views had not only moved toward the left throughout college but that their experiences allowed them to develop a stronger foundation for their political identities, based on issue-specific beliefs and ideologies. This, in turn, also made students increasingly critical of the traditional political parties. One senior describes:  I struggle with calling myself a Democrat. It was easier for me in 2016. As you learn more about the wrongdoings on both sides of the aisle it’s so hard for me to be so staunchly - so blindly - Democrat. I do think you can be a Democrat and hold the party accountable.130 This may also fall in line with data conclusions regarding Perceptions, showing that the students who were more questioning of their campus and the world around them were also those who were more likely to have left-leaning ideas Students were also asked to describe the political issues that mattered most to them. In response, students expressed a variety of passionate opinions on topics that include, but are not limited to gun control, labor rights, global trade, reproductive justice, LGBTQ+ rights, the drug crisis, and voting rights. The political issues mentioned most were climate change, healthcare, and immigration. Most students expressed an urgent concern for climate change and environmental policy. Passion for this issue stemmed from both their academic studies, social media engagement, and overall fear for their futures. Students described frustration in saying:  You can’t be talking about anything else if you don’t have a planet to sustain an argument about anything else. You need a planet to argue about things in the first place. That’s number one.  130 Senior from Houston, TX 85  Above all, this was the issue that pushed students to engage on their campuses. They were active in campus climate organizations, volunteered to canvas, and joined protests against the university administration’s investment in fossil fuels.  Students also expressed deep personal concern and connection to the issue of healthcare. One senior described her family’s struggle with securing healthcare while a junior from San Diego, California spoke to his concern for poor quality care in light of not having coverage. Other students spoke to the frustration of strikingly high medical fees for individuals with healthcare coverage. Most of all, students spoke to the importance of immigration reform both out of personal connection to the issue and out of disdain and frustration with the Administration. Participants described their concerns for parents and family members who are immigrants and described stories in the news such as the family separation issue as “inhumane.” Students also expressed learning new perspectives on the issue through their coursework: Immigration is very important because after learning about what certain human rights are, like the human right to the freedom of movement. I realize that society has these arbitrary laws that grant people citizenship based on the fact that they were born somewhere and I think that that is an arbitrary kind of law. So, I'm thinking why can't someone who happened to be born somewhere else and wants a better life come to the United States. That's a reason why. It's also personal to me – I'm Mexican, my family is of immigrants.131 Participants expressed that the news and rhetoric around immigration also pushed them to act. For some students, this meant seeking out volunteer opportunities or internships that were focused on advocacy for immigrant rights. Overall, there was an overwhelming sense of exasperation and sadness over the narrative constructed around immigrants:  131 Junior from San Diego, CA 86  My heart breaks. Texas is largely Hispanic and there are so many people there who - whether or not they came here legally or illegally - I realize that they're good people and I really hate seeing the news that everyone only talks about the select immigrants who are causing havoc in communities or criminals when there are so many here making an honest life and really trying to do what's best for their family. So that's very near and dear to my heart. Important Experiences  While students brought up several important topics and concerns, some are necessary to include: the experience of first-generation, low-income (FGLI) students and the perceptions of how identities are treated on campus. During the interviews, many students spoke to their experiences identifying as both Latinx and FGLI, speaking to the point that their FGLI identity was particularly salient on campus. Students expressed that it often leads to more uncomfortable and negative experiences than their Latinx identity. This occurred in conversations about finances with friends or feeling that faculty members doubted their ability to succeed academically simply because of their socioeconomic backgrounds.  Individuals also spoke to the issue of the lack of representation for identities other than Latinx on campus. Numerous students spoke to the even greater lack of representation for Black students and the lack of willingness to hear the voices of sexual assault survivors. Students pointed out that the lack of representation and negative aspects of being on campus were often subtle. One senior from New Jersey expanded on this by speaking to the lack of funding and physical space for campus cultural centers. I feel like [the cultural centers] are definitely not included on campus. I feel like Penn takes pride in \"We're a diverse school, we take people from all over, different cultures and identities\" but when you think about the funding that goes into these 87  cultural groups, the spaces that they occupy on this campus, it's like, when there's an issue or when there's something that cultural groups bring up with Penn leadership, it feels like they're not being prioritized or they would rather just allocate other things on campus. The spaces that we're given as compared to other organizations on campus - that shows that. A senior from Houston described the difficulties that minority identities face on campus overall: I think for the majority identities which I classify as being white, cis-gendered, straight, and middle to upper class at Penn. I see those as commonplace, the ordinary. That affects the expectations that are placed on these populations or people who identify in a number of those categories. That affects how the world has interacted with them before they got here and now that they're here. It affects their access to certain things and I feel like on the other side of that there are racial/ethnic minorities, low-income students, non-straight, non-cis students or any other marginalized identities. I think that also extends to religious minorities in the United States or at Penn. I think that in almost the inverse they also have different sets of expectations but their being here is somehow extra-ordinary. Their being here is somehow \"You should have just been this.\" Or \"Other people in your racial group, socioeconomic class are just this. They only do this much. But you are doing so much more.\" Which is a very complicated notion that I think makes the person receiving those comments feel that something is exceptional about them, not that they aren't exceptional, but it then ignores the more structural things that I think keeps a lot of those identities out of spaces like these. This also speaks to the experience of marginalized identities on campus which was evident in the data for both the longitudinal and relational studies. Students of multiple identities, whether it be 88  Latinx and LBGTQ+, female, or FGLI, go about their lives on campus carrying the lived experience of each identity with them. Their perception of the world and actions are impacted by these identities, especially when placed in spaces that are traditionally built for majority identities. On college campuses, these identities are often white, male, and heterosexual. For so many interviewed students, having multiple of these identities gave them perspective and impacted how they viewed their own experiences on campus. Conclusion  The interviews showed a diverse set of experiences by Latinx students on Penn’s campus. Students were represented across schools, majors, hometowns, as well as by their level of involvement in on-campus activities. Major themes present in the interview data ranged from the experience of being a Latinx student to the varying influences that impacted student’s political engagement. Students spoke to the isolation they felt from conversations in coursework or on-campus activities because of their identity.  There was also a distinct frustration felt among students related to negative experiences on campus tied to identity. Although students expressed that they had never felt direct acts of discrimination, they were impacted by microaggressions in day to day life and an overall lack of representation on campus. Social connections and intellectual curiosity also pushed students to engage and learn about specific political issues. One of the themes that stood out most among the interviews was the degree to which students viewed the 2016 election as important. Students described the election of Donald Trump as impacting their perspective on their own identity, their engagement, and their outlook on the political system. Overall, there was a resilience and internal drive among students to learn beyond headlines. Despite multiple comments of doubt of their engagement, students nonetheless expressed an in-depth knowledge and passion for the issues that were important to them. 89  The interviews complemented many of the findings in the survey data. The personal experiences of Penn students spoke to the perceptions of racial tension and discrimination, high level of exposure to other ethnicities, and involvement in identity-based organizations present in the survey data. Together, the interviews suggest several connections between campus experiences, socialization, and political engagement and partisanship. Students described their internal motivations for learning about political issues as well as high levels of questioning the world and ideas around them. This worked in conjunction with a predisposition for students to be critical of their campus and to join organizations related to their identity. Considering the higher levels of engagement and perceptions of racial tension among Latinx students in the data, this might suggest that this predisposition could lead to a critical outlook on campus and on politics that sparks anger and engagement. The interviews showed that students view interactions with other ethnic identities as nearly commonplace - a natural consequence of attending a university. This is, however, often dependent on the context of the interaction.   A feature unique to the interviews is the level of insight that students spoke of concerning intersectional identities. Students with multiple marginalized identities expressed how their perceptions of campus interactions differed from others. From internal conflicts about identities that clashed with being Latinx to feeling uncomfortable in campus conversations around their status as FGLI students, students carried their identities with them in every experience. The interviews also differed from the survey data in showing that outside factors, such as institutional diversity and respective hometowns, influenced the political outlooks of students. Overall, the interviews brought to light some of the distinctive features of the experience of Latinx students on college campuses and their outlooks and motivations for engagement with politics.     90  Conclusion  The Latinx population in the United States is dynamic, diverse, and ever-growing. The ethnic group has a long history of migration patterns and activism related to issues of political representation, equity in schooling and healthcare, and in reaction to recent anti-immigrant policies. Using theories of social identity, group consciousness, and socialization, this thesis sought to understand how campus experiences for Latinx undergraduates may influence their political behaviors and outlooks. The experiences of students in the survey data and interviews reflected a large number of preexisting theories and ideas of ethnic group consciousness and socialization. Campus experiences that show positive effects on political behaviors are those that make Latinx identity salient and foster community and education among students. These are experiences like participating in racial or ethnic student organizations, attending cultural awareness workshops, perceiving racial tension on campus, and experiencing discrimination first-hand. The findings also reflect much of the existing literature on Latinx partisanship, showing that not only do Latinx students begin college with a greater lean toward left ideologies than their white peers but that those ideologies only increase as time passes.   In the longitudinal study, the data showed that Latinx students shift toward left-leaning political views and demonstrate an increase in their political engagement, namely through publicly communicating their opinion or demonstrating for a cause. These increases occurred during a time when issues like same-sex marriage, immigration, and police brutality were major events in the media. The relational portion of the research expanded on the prior findings, showing that campus experiences have more significant effects on political participation than they do on students' political views. Among campus experience variable groups, Ethnic Exposure has the least impact, likely because interactions with other ethnicities are common on campuses, as supported by the interview data. The experience of feeling discriminated against 91  because of ethnicity also had positive effects on political participation. Among independent variable groups, Perceptions and Campus Activities show the greatest significant impacts on political behaviors. The interview data shows that Latinx students often feel negative impacts from microaggressions or feelings of isolation and underrepresentation because of their ethnic identity. They also feel a social push to engage politically and intellectual curiosity to learn more about specific issues. Students expressed left-leaning ideologies and extremely passionate viewpoints on several issues, namely climate change, healthcare, and immigration. Students with multiple marginalized identities, especially LGBTQ+ students, show the greatest changes in political behaviors in both longitudinal and relational studies, supporting predictions of increased engagement resulting from intersectional identities.132 A takeaway which was not present in the survey data portion of this thesis was also the importance of students' backgrounds and upbringings before college. Many interviewed students came from communities where their ethnic identity was largely represented. They described this as impacting how they perceived campus and political events. This might suggest that while the college experience plays a large role in political socialization, an influential factor may be a student's home environment. While this information is not present in the survey data, it is nonetheless important to consider when analyzing the results of this research.   Most significant and surprising of the results, from both quantitative and qualitative studies, are student perceptions of campus. Feelings that racial tension is present on a student’s respective campus were higher among Latinx students and show significant positive effects on political views and participation. This might suggest that students who hold these perceptions might also be those who are more likely to engage in change for those issues. Here, it might be interesting to dive deeper and understand when and how these perceptions develop: Do students  132 Moreau, J., Nuño-Pérez, S., & Sanchez, L.M. (2019). 92  enter college with these ideas or do they develop as a result of being on campus? Nonetheless, this supports that student political behaviors cannot just be understood or described by a student's campus activities but by factors of their background and political outlooks as well. Lastly, and most important in the context of today, is the significance of the 2016 election to interviewed students. For every interview in which the election was brought up, students remembered the night of the election with extreme detail. They expressed feeling scared, angry, and targeted because of their ethnic identity, supporting ideas that the election was, indeed, a case of national group threat toward the Latinx population. Students also expressed a sense of linked-fate when speaking to issues that disproportionately affected the Latinx community and other people of color. They spoke to the inequalities they saw impact others in the healthcare system, in cases of police brutality, and most of all, within immigration. All students, whether or not they expressed personally knowing or having a direct connection to an immigrant, expressed frustration with the current state of immigration policy. Students found that the recent rhetoric demonized their ethnic identity and so many people similar to them and their families. As a result, students sought out opportunities to be advocates for these issues, showing a direct connection between their identity and civic activism.133 Nonetheless, the experience of being on a college campus makes many identities salient for students, even if those identities were not necessarily salient to them prior. This especially stands true for Latinx students in the era of the Trump Administration. It is necessary to question if the experience of being a Latinx student during this period impacts a student's overall perception of campus. Seeing racial discrimination in the larger scope of current events may make similar injustices easier to identify on campus. This could easily add to the frustration felt  133 Chan, W.Y. & Latzman, R.D. (2014). 93  by minority students and, possibly, contribute to an ever-growing motivation for political engagement based on their identity and group consciousness. Future Research  There will always be more to learn about Latinx youth, let alone the Latinx population in the United States. The findings and discussion of this thesis have shown the importance of investigating so many other dimensions of political behaviors, Latinx politics, and education. For one, research should investigate the question of student predispositions. It should seek to understand the political psychology between students who come into college wanting to take part in certain activities, who are critical of campus experiences, and who are politically active. Research should also investigate how a minority student's background and upbringing impacts their experience in college from their perceptions and reactions to campus involvement. This thesis highlighted the role of social connections in motivating students to engage. Research should address the role that friends and social circles might play in a student's political knowledge and outlook. While there exists a bevy of literature on the topic, more research is needed to understand the differences between intersectional identities within Latinx communities. Studies should also explore outside the scope of this thesis – investigating the political behaviors of Latinx youth who do not attend 4-year institutions, as their engagement is just as important. Lastly and most importantly, political science research should focus on how to take campus experiences and convert them into voter turnout numbers. Studies should investigate how to transform racialized group threat and resulting non-electoral engagement into voting among Latinx youth either through campaign strategies or messaging.     The experience of Latinx students is as unique and dynamic as the rest of the population. Experiences vary by background: by national origin, socioeconomic status, sexual identity, gender, hometown region, and even by the very college or university a student attends. This 94  thesis shows that many campus activities have significant relationships with student political behaviors. Student involvement in identity-based organizations and perceptions of racial issues on campus have positive effects on political behaviors. Most informative, and likely most relevant today, is that Latinx students report higher numbers of experiencing racial discrimination and political participation. While it may not be shown in turnout numbers, students nonetheless express their dissatisfaction with the political system and respond to discrimination through nonelectoral activities. Although turnout rates and the media often paint an image of disengaged youth, Latinx students are passionate, informed, and involved members of their communities.       i Appendix A – Preliminary Data  TABLE A.1 Ethnicity x Ethnicity             Mexican/Chicano Puerto Rican Other Latino Total Latinx White White/Caucasian 38.60% 47.10% 39.50% 41.40% N/A African American/Black 1.70% 9.60% 3.30% 3.60% 1.20% American Indian/Alaska Native 4% 1.30% 1.70% 2.10% 1% East Asian (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese) 3.40% 3.80% 2.40% 2.80% 1.90% Filipino 2.30% 1.30% 1.40% 1.40% 0.70% Southeast Asian (e.g., Cambodian, Vietnamese, Hmong) 0.30% 0.10% 0.20% 0.10% 0.20% South Asian (e.g., Indian, Pakistani, Nepalese, Sri Lankan) 0.30% 1.30% 1.40% 0.80% 0.20% Other Asian 0.30% 1.30% 1.00% 0.50% 0.20% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 2% 2.50% 0.50% 1% 0.40% Mexican/Chicano N/A 5.10% 8.80% 40.70% 1.70% Puerto Rican 2% N/A 5.50% 18.20% 0.90% Other Latino 10.50% 14.60% N/A 48.60% 1.90% Other 2% 1.90% 3.10% 2.10% 0.80% Total 385 161 441 864 9045 Source: 2016 The College Senior Survey (CSS)       TABLE A.2 Ethnicity x Financial Aid (Family Resources)   Mexican/Chicano Puerto Rican Other Latinx Total Latinx White None 20.40% 20% 19.90% 19.60% 10.80% $1 to $5,999 34.80% 31.30% 28.60% 31.20% 18.50% $6,000 to $14,999 22.40% 17.80% 17.30% 19.40% 18.90% $15,000 or More 22.40% 31.10% 34.10% 29.80% 51.70% Total 385 161 441 864 9045 Source: 2016 The College Senior Survey (CSS)          ii  TABLE A.3 Ethnicity x Social Identity Variables     Mexican/Chicano Puerto Rican Other Latinx Total Latinx White Multiracial Yes 53.90% 58.60% 49.80% 52.40% 8.00% Sex Male 27.80% 33.50% 32.70% 31.10% 36.40%   Female 72.20% 66.50% 67.30% 68.90% 63.30% Transgender   0.50% 0.00% 0.00% 0.20% 0.50% Sexual Orientation Heterosexual/Straight 83.00% 87.30% 87.20% 85.60% 90.70%   LGBTQ+ 17.00% 12.70% 12.80% 14.40% 9.30% Is English your native language No 23.80% 14.40% 28.50% 24.60% 1.60%   Yes 76.20% 85.60% 71.50% 75.40% 98.40% Citizenship Status U.S. Citizen 97.90% 100.00% 87.10% 93.10% 98.80%  Permanent resident (green card) 0.80% 0.00% 5.50% 2.70% 0.50%   Neither 1.30% 0.00% 7.40% 4.20% 0.70% Total   385 161 441 864 9045 Source: 2016 The College Senior Survey (CSS)   TABLE A.4 Ethnicity x School Demographics             Mexican/Chicano Puerto Rican Other Latinx Total Latinx White Institution's sex Male only 0.80% 0.00% 0.00% 0.30% 0.90%  Female only 3.90% 1.20% 1.40% 2.40% 1.10%   Co-ed 95.30% 98.80% 98.60% 97.20% 98.00% Institution Type University 18.20% 14.30% 24.50% 19.70% 14.70%   4-year College 81.80% 85.70% 75.50% 80.30% 85.30% Institution Control Public 4.70% 0.60% 2.50% 2.70% 3.70% Private 95.30% 99.40% 97.50% 97.30% 96.30% Institution region West 52.20% 11.20% 24.50% 30.40% 20.50% Midwest 19.00% 5.00% 7.00% 11.80% 18.80% South 9.40% 9.30% 11.60% 10.60% 9.20% Northeast 19.50% 74.50% 56.90% 47.10% 51.50% Total N   385 161 441 864 9045 Source: 2016 The College Senior Survey (CSS)      iii Appendix B – Longitudinal Data  Questions: 1.

    "abstract": "Latinx youth are increasingly the focus of American politics and campaigns. They are a passionate and ever-growing segment of what is predicted to be the largest ethnic group of eligible voters in 2020. However, this population consistently produces low rates of turnout in national elections. This thesis aims to understand how the campus experiences of Latinx undergraduates may influence their political behaviors in light of recent events. Political behaviors are assessed by political views and political participation in both electoral and nonelectoral activities. Using survey data from the Higher Education Research Institute, the study first investigates changes in students\\u27 political behaviors from their freshmen to senior years. It then examines the relationship between those behaviors and campus experiences. The research analyzes the results based on differences in identity such as sexual orientation, gender, socioeconomic background, and acculturation. The paper also provides deeper insight into campus experiences through in-person interviews at the University of Pennsylvania. The results conclude that campus experiences that make Latinx identity salient and provide students with opportunities for education on social issues and activism have the greatest impact on political behaviors. Participation in identity-based organizations and first-hand experiences of discrimination show significant positive effects on political behaviors, namely political participation. Students who feel that racial tension is present on their campuses are also increasingly left-leaning and have higher levels of political participation. The research also found that students show passionate reactions to cases of national group threat and that those of intersectional identities are more likely to have higher rates of political engagement. The paper then provides insight into future research on understanding the dynamics of Latinx students and political engagement",
