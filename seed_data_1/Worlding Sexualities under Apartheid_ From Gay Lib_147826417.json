A host of businesses, residentialcomplexes, bars, and restaurants made Hillbrow the locus of an emerging gayand lesbian presence in the country. On a 2012 visit to Gay and LesbianMemory in Action (formerly the Gay and Lesbian Archives of South Africa) inJohannesburg, archivist Gabriel Hoosain accompanied me on a Queer WalkingTour of Hillbrow, a cultural historical experience that I hope to translate in thisessay. The area is no longer the gayborhood it was in the 1980s and 1990s.There are some buildings and spots which stand out as legendary: Connections,which began as a gay bar about three decades ago, but soon became a popularvenue for lesbians; Skyline bar, where the first pride parade was planned; andthe corner of Twist and Pretoria streets named after the black gay activist SimonNkoli. Today, though there are identifiable gay areas in Johannesburg, thevenues for socializing and activism are found in various locations in and aroundthe city.1 There are many ways of accessing this period when inner-city Johannes-burg areas such as Hillbrow, Berea, Joubert Park, and surrounding locations,emerged as a hub of gay socializing and activism. Examining gay journalism asgay liberation literature, this essay forwards a cultural history of sexuality informedby comparative urban and queer studies. My main argument is that gay liberationliterature under apartheid lags behind important shifts in sexual activism; and mylarger aim is to extend the valences of postcolonial queer studies towards a histori-cal examination of North–South interactions in theorizing sexual activism.2 Gayliberation literature here refers to texts which contributed to the emergence of agay and lesbian sexualities in South Africa, including works of fiction, poetry,drama, anthologies as well as newsletters, newspapers, and newsletters.3 Theprimary archive used as an example of gay liberation literature is Link/Skakel,the official newsletter of the GASA, which later became a mainstream gay news-paper called Exit.The analysis offered here extends into the domain of sexuality what Aihwa Onghas recently theorized as ‘worlding projects’ of emergent global formations which‘seem to form a critical mass in urban centers, making cities both critical sites inwhich to inquire into worlding projects, as well as the ongoing result and targetof specific worldings’.4 Achille Mbembe’s elaboration of Taiye Selasie’s term‘Afropolitanism’ to the realm of urban studies is important to my analysis of theworlding of sexualities under apartheid. Mbembe posits Johannesburg as thePostcolonial Studies, 2016, Vol. 19, No. 1, 37–52© 2016 The Institute of Postcolonial Studieshttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13688790.2016.1222857centre of Afropolitanism, based on its ‘multiple racial legacies, a vibrant economy,a liberal democracy, a culture of consumerism that partakes directly of the flows ofglobalization’.5 Mbembe’s and Sarah Nuttall’s discussion of Johannesburg as anAfropolis extends the theoretical valence of Afropolitanism to a cityscapemarked by change and reinvention.An overly celebratory view of Afropolitanism has been countered by discus-sions of easy access to mobility across borders, consumerist and elitist connota-tions of the term, and its exclusions. Simon Gikandi’s foreword to a 2011collection titled Negotiating Afropolitanism strikes a cautionary note by mention-ing how the term which can be ‘read as the description of a new phenomenology ofAfricanness—of being African in the world’ also invites a consideration of ‘thenegative consequences of transnationalism, the displacement of Africans abroad,the difficulties they face as they try to overcome their alterity in alien landscapes,the deep cultural anxieties that often make diasporas sites of cultural fundamental-ism and ethnic chauvinism’.6 Among others, Binyavanga Wainaina and YewandeOmotoso have taken issue with Afropolitanism as a descriptor of a literary or socialcondition. Indeed Wainaina’s memoir One Day I Will Write About This Place(2011) can be read a gloss on Afropolitanism. Here multiple linguistic influences,an anglicized education, the experience of intra-African migration, awareness ofsexual difference, and international literary acclaim prefigure the emergence of asexual identity. Wainaina critiques the term Afropolitan in favour of ‘pan-African’ in his 2012 address to the UK African Studies Association. Similarly,the South African novelist Yewande Omotoso comments on the term as ‘usefulfor the West as it gives the West an opportunity to understand and even“consume”Africa’.7 There are different ways of being Afropolitan: migratory, con-sumerist, and Western-oriented; localized, anti-consumerist, and Africa-oriented.Acknowledging various aspects and uses of Afropolitanism and its importantcritiques, my focus is on specific forms of worlding to analyse the transformationof a predominantly white male gay activism in Johannesburg from the 1980s tothe1990s. Mbembe and Nuttall describe Johannesburg as ‘a thoroughly polygloturban formation whose influence, connections, and identifications extendbeyond its locality and well beyond South Africa’.8 Afropolitanism, which thisessay both invokes and places under erasure, when prefixed with queer, helpsme think of connections between the movement for sexual rights and the anti-apartheid movement arising within a specific urban metropolitan context, butextending beyond it to national and transnational spaces and contexts. Mypurpose is to further discussion around the term through the juxtaposition in‘queer Afropolitanism’, and to present its generative potential for debates on lit-erary, national, and sexual identity.9A key concept connecting the anti-apartheid and sexual activism is ‘visibility’.Ashley Currier writes that social movements desire both visibility and invisibilityat different times, and this was certainly true of the gay liberation movement inJohannesburg. GASA’s ‘cultivated apolitical visibility’ dictated in part by concernsof safety in the early 1980s, was followed by pressure by black and lesbian GASAmembers to abandon the apolitical stance in favour of alliance with the anti-apart-heid movement in the mid-1980s and 1990s.10 In the early 1980s gay activistsdemanded legal change and political representation but did not pursue a broadKANIKA BATRA38conception of rights inclusive of racial and sexual equality. In a retrospective lookat GASA and in response to the question ‘Where were you in the eighties?’ AnnSmith, one of the founding members of the organization, mentions that ratherthan see ‘oppression as a continuum’, the creation of a ‘safe space in which gaymen and women could meet and interact without fear of being condemned, brutal-ized, shamed, humiliated or arrested’ constituted a ‘gay liberation movement’ forthe organization.11 Early 1980s gay efforts were often directed towards claimingurban and national spaces without challenging segregation, reflecting a distinctlynarrow conception of rights based on consumerist sexual identities. Indeed, the ear-liest essay on Exit and gay publishing in South Africa by Gerry Davidson and RonNerio, describes how despite the state of Emergency in 1986 and 1987, the news-paper ‘focused almost totally on parochial affairs’ and continued to ‘reflect thewhite gay establishment’s attitudes by steering clear of politics’.12 A genuinedesire for inclusivity was expressed by a few of the GASA members, amongthem lesbians in the organization. Often these efforts were hampered by GASA’sapolitical cautionary reformist orientation. It was only in the late 1980s that thegay and lesbian collectivity engendered in Hillbrow and sustained through printcame to be identified as ‘queer’. Brenna Munro and Chantal Zabus take up thevalences of queer in African contexts by strategically using the label and challen-ging its Euro-American connotations.13 While it is accurate to note the use of queerin the African context as a ‘shorthand for practices that cannot be fully subsumedinto identitarian labels of lesbian, gay, transgender, bisexual, or those that cannotbe adequately translated into European languages’, my call is for a specificity inthe deployment of the term based on historical, national, and activist contexts.14To this end, my suggestion is that in the South African context queer marks theemergence of an intersectional politics that connected the anti-apartheid and gayand lesbian rights movements.Recognition of and respect for racial, cultural, geographical, and gender differ-ences within the gay movement, building connections between multiple forms ofoppression, and a conscious effort at international connections best describes theworlding of sexualities in the changing political climate of apartheid SouthAfrica.15 As revealed in the pages of Exit, the emergence of a sexual subculturein Johannesburg was initially influenced by models of gay consumerism and acti-vism in the North with a disregard for inequities created by racial, gender, and classprivilege. However, the direction of comparison from North–South and the exclu-sivist racial and gendered assumptions were challenged first by lesbians in GASAand later, black activists from the Gays and Lesbians of Witwatersrand (GLOW).These groups urged for attention to racialized, gendered, and non-metropolitanarticulations of sexuality, a process which has continued in the ongoing interrog-ation of South Africa’s historic enshrinement of gay and lesbian rights co-existingwith increasing levels of homophobia in cities and townships, still tarmarked withsexualized violence.Profit and Pleasure in the AfropolisMany studies of Johannesburg focus on the dissolution of spatial segregation fromthe 1980s onwards, which led to some areas becoming more racially diverse thanWORLDING SEXUALITIES UNDER APARTHEID39had been the case in the previous decades.16 In this respect, Johannesburg can becompared with other African cities which have been analysed as sites of discursive,economic, cultural, and social transactions and as gendered, raced, and sexualizedspaces.17 Loren Kruger’s description of Johannesburg as an ‘edgy city’ describesthe ‘pervasive nervousness expressed by blacks and whites in the face of crime andgrime in the 1990s’.18 The story of the passage of time in Johannesburg and its dif-ficult transition from racial exclusivity to a mixed-race, grey space in the 1980s and1990s establishes a direct connection between desegregation and the ‘flight’ ofwhite people from the inner city to the suburbs.19This section describes patterns of gay life and consumption in Johannesburg rep-resented by Link/Skakel as directly linked to the processes Ong labels ‘urban mod-elling’ and ‘inter-referencing’ where the initial trajectory of influence from theNorth to the South acquires an African worldliness following the dissolution ofspatial segregation.20 One of the earliest studies to discuss the slow process ofdesegregation in the context of economic growth, urban architectural needs, andhousing scarcity for black and coloured people, Nigel Mandy’s work is also impor-tant for describing how the North American city model was adopted by Johannes-burg planners.21 This model arguably influenced white gay subculture from the1960s onward, though Mandy does not directly address this. Noting this connec-tion, Neville Hoad observes the ‘superficial sameness to commercial gay life (rep-resentationally white) in the major South African metropolises that is recognizablyNorth American urban’.22 The historical evolution of this sexual subculture there-fore needs to be examined in ways that are local, national, and transnational. In acommonly repeated explanation Mandy mentions that the Group Areas Act of1950 ensured that ‘voluntary’ ethnic residential separation, a natural feature ofall cities, became a formalized and involuntary process.23 Mandy recounts ingreat detail the long struggle for desegregation of inner-city restaurants from the1970s onwards by using those in the Carlton Center as an example. Kruger’sdescription of the Carlton Center as a ‘site of apartheid absurdity’where the restau-rant was open to ‘international’ blacks including Bantustan bureaucrats, but not toblack township residents’ further glosses the spatial inequalities of the era.24 Thefree market rationale used to justify such desegregation echoes the propagandaof the Association of Chambers of Commerce of South Africa (Assocom) thatthe growing city economy demanded a desegregated city space where blackswere free to secure gainful employment and to avail services offered in the cityas consumers.25These two contexts—that of the city as modelled on North American urbandevelopment; and the growing presence of black, coloured, and Indians asworkers and consumers following the relaxation of petty apartheid principles—characterize Hillbrow’s emergence as a gay area in the 1980s and its apparent‘degeneration’ in the 1990s. Increased international attention on South Africanracial policies in print and other media, combined with an acute housing shortagefor black and coloured people in Johannesburg, led to the slow integration of thecity, explaining the change in Hillbrow from an upscale white to a reluctantly inte-grated neighbourhood. Building on Alan Mabin’s important work, Beall, Crank-shaw, and Parnell observe that during ‘the 1970s and 1980s, inner-cityresidential areas continued to enjoy a bohemian reputation, a flourishing urbanismKANIKA BATRA40unknown anywhere else in South Africa’.26 In a sense then, the flourishing Afro-politanism of the 1980s and 1990s was as much due to established non-Africanmodels of commercial and residential planning as it was due to the sexual,racial, cultural, economic, and national diversity of the inhabitants.This then was the urban context for the emergence of Link/Skakel (hereafter L/S),the official newsletter of the GASA, published simultaneously in English and Afri-kaans, creating an ‘imagined community’ in Johannesburg through the medium ofprint. The inaugural L/S published in May 1982 mentions that at its first meeting,GASA, an amalgam of three organizations, Lambda, Uniteˊ, and Amo, discussed‘subjects as diverse as the need for community service, welfare, law reform, theimprovement of the gay image, the establishment of a gay identity, entertainment,and subjects of a more organisational nature’.27 Thus the publication’s activist-informational-consumerist purpose is evident from the beginning. Mark Gevisser’scomprehensive review of the South African gay and lesbian movement from the1960s to the 1990s in Defiant Desirementions there was never a clear demarcationbetween the social and organizational needs of GASA.28 This is reflected in thecontents of the first newsletter which contains an announcement to compile aPink Pages Telephone Directory where ‘business concerns can advertise underappropriate headings’ as well as information about membership dues to the organ-ization.29 The first few newsletters are a dazzling display of conspicuous consump-tion, with advertisements from gay-friendly businesses offering luxurycommodities including cosmetics, flowers, jewellery, clothes and furnishings,and international travel services. In addition, there are a number of ‘news’reports on various gay-friendly restaurants. The circulation of capital and servicesto world these emerging sexualities are a key feature of gay and (to a lesser extent)lesbian lives in the Afropolis in the 1980s. As Graeme Reid’s work on gay iden-tities in ‘small-town’ South Africa demonstrates, the consumption of ‘fashion,style, and glamour’ remain a key feature of gay lives in the post-apartheid scenarioeven away from the centre of the Afropolis, a queer Afropolitanism that is refiguredin peri-urban locations.30The relation between capitalism, migration to urban areas, and gay identity isapplicable to Hillbrow which was already recognized as a bohemian inner-cityarea before it became the centre of gay socialization and activism in the1980s.31 The visibility and activism of lesbians in Johannesburg can be documen-ted in relation to (and not distinct and separate from) dominant gay male activismin GASA and later in queer politics in South Africa in the 1980s and 1990s, as evi-denced by Karen Lotter and Ann Smith’s participation in GASA and regular con-tributions to its official newsletter. Lotter and GASA Rand’s chairperson, Smith’sarticles on social lesbianism, lesbian identity, role playing, and radical lesbianopposition to gay liberation ensured that lesbians had a voice in GASA and itsprint publications.32 Lesbian women also obtained access to spaces such as restau-rants and bars, indicating a trajectory of socialization and activism that spatiallyconverges with but ideologically diverges from that of white and Afrikaaner gaymen. For example, a venue such as Buddies on Twist Street, which first advertiseditself as an ‘all male bar/disco’, continued to remain gender segregated for a whilebefore revisiting its strategy and marketing itself anew as a ‘private club’ open to‘men and women’.33 Other establishments realized that there was money to beWORLDING SEXUALITIES UNDER APARTHEID41obtained from a lesbian clientele, and abandoned the policy of bars and clubs asexclusively male spaces.While participating in the worldliness of metropolitan gay life offered by Johan-nesburg, black gay men and lesbians often found themselves sidelined both fromthe movement as well as from its patterns of consumption. The next section exam-ines some of the legal challenges to governmental jurisdictions on sexuality andrace that inhibited an egalitarian worlding of sexualities.Law, Politics, and ‘Community’Of the laws on record, the Immorality Act of 1957, later renamed the SexualOffences Act, banned sexual relations between all whites and non-whites. Untilthe ban was lifted in 1985, homo or heterosexual relations between people ofdifferent races were proscribed under this act. The history of law reform by gayand lesbian activists can be charted to the 1960s when the apartheid governmentintroduced amendments to existing legislation that sought to include homosexu-ality under its purview. The gay community came together to form the LawReform Movement in 1968 in an effort to prevent draconian applications of theImmorality Act against homosexuals. Gevisser observes that the movement was‘successful’ inasmuch as only three amendments to the current law were proposed:raising the age of consent from 16 to 19, outlawing dildos, and the prohibition ofsexual activity between men at a ‘party’, where party was defined as the presenceof more than two people. Besides these restrictions applicable to all, black peoplewere not permitted to move into the city through the provisos of the Group AreasAct of 1950 which was amended several times in the 1960s and 1970s to excludethem from living in developed urban areas. The act was untenable in Johannesburgfrom the 1970s onwards when a shortage of housing and development of theservice economy led to increasing, though technically illegal, migration to the city.Identity based movements in the Global South, especially women’s and LGBTmovements, are often analysed in terms of victimhood due to their focus on socialand legislative discrimination as the basis of sexual rights activism.34 Despitemany discriminatory laws on record during apartheid, gay men and lesbianwomen combatted the description and ascription of victimhood by focusing onlaw reform in the 1960s, community education during the 1980s, and politicalinvolvement in the 1990s, as documented in L/S/Exit. Mbembe identifies arefusal of victim status as one of the key attributes of Afropolitanism, yet gay acti-vists’ struggle against victimhood was sometimes marked by a suspect racial andgender politics that prefigured the demise of GASA and a move away from theoriginal aim of its publications.35 In this GASA’s stand was no different fromthat of a similar organizations in North America, for instance, the Gay ActivistsAlliance, which followed a ‘single issue politics’ in the 1980s that, according toUrvashi Vaid, operated ‘under the assumption that gay rights are related to but dis-connected from other kinds of civil freedom’.36 Reformist rather than radical in itsorientation, GASA followed a controversial trajectory of selective legal reform asevident in its newsletter.During the first two years of its publication, L/S took its role of educating the gaymen in the city about their rights very seriously. A column by Michael titled ‘YouKANIKA BATRA42and the Law’, published regularly from 1982 onwards, addressed several commonproblems faced by gay men including their status within Common Law, infor-mation on statutory offences, on being accosted by the police, and on proceduresof criminal cases.37 Since lesbian sexuality was not under the purview of theImmorality Act Amendment, and black movement in the inner city came underthe Group Areas Act, the primary and implied readership of these articles wereurban, gay men who risked persecution by cruising in public spaces. Identifiedonly as the GASA lawyer, Michael attempted to address the rights of couplesfrom different races in June 1983 in response to several queries about the ‘questionof occupation of residential premises’, particularly if the ‘association is betweenpeople of different colour’. His final advice to people of different races cohabitingin an urban area is ‘You need a sympathetic area, a sympathetic landlord, andnerves of steel to be able to feel at all comfortable about it.’38 Other legaladvice offered in the newsletter was about violation of privacy, intimidation,employment rights of sexual minorities, wills and the rights of partners in gayrelationships, and rights of gay parents after divorce from a heterosexual partner.In summary, this column offered comprehensive legal advice in non-specialist,accessible language for a largely white, gay male readership.Gay liberation literature faced other challenges including censorship. In early1984 the April andMay numbers of L/Swere sent to the Directorate of Publicationsin Capetown as samples after its registration as a newspaper for public sale.However, since the Publications Act applied only to commercial publications, inAugust 1984 it was decided to cancel the registration of L/S as a newspaper andto distribute it free of cost to members of GASA. The movement’s awareness ofgay people’s right to the city which was apparent in the advertisements andcolumns of the newsletter, and the threat of persecution under the PublicationsAct, led to strategic changes both in the nature of activism and its official publi-cation. From July 1985 onwards L/S was converted to Exit, described as ‘totallyindependent and not connected to any gay organisation or group’.39A specificinstance of this independence is the discontinuation of ‘You and the Law’,perhaps because of GASA’s increasing focus on a broader campaign for lawreform.Taking inspiration from the Law Reform Movement in the 1960s when the gaycommunity had come together to fund a legal campaign, a similar move wasattempted in the 1980s. Law reform became a nationwide effort in 1986, partiallyin response to incidents such as the Vice Squad raid on the GASA convention inJohannesburg that year. The setting up of the Legal Reform Fund in early 1986 anda fundraising effort called Benefit to collect R 100,000 for legal costs wasannounced with much fanfare in the pages of Exit in October 1985.40 Gevisser,a distinguished journalist, gay rights advocate, and supporter of the campaign,has written about the discrepancy between the grandiose aims and disappointingconsequences of the campaign using 1968 as a point of comparison:Unlike 1968, however, there was not the same government focus: PW Botha’s campaign tosmash anti-apartheid resistance overtook all else and the gay issue was forgotten. TheNLRF [National Legal Reform Fund] had raised R 59,000 by January 1987, but hadnothing to spend it on: it was thus transformed into the National Law Reform CharitableWORLDING SEXUALITIES UNDER APARTHEID43Trust. Three trustees were appointed, and it was decided that this money would be used infuture to ‘market gay lifestyles’ and to intervene, in any possible way, in the gay law reformstruggle in South Africa. Of the 59,000 raised, however, only R10, 000 was spent, andthere was much dissatisfaction within the gay community: talk abounded of misappropriationof funds.41Not only was the national fund used for purposes other than those for which it wasoriginally intended, but its largesse was restricted to metropolitan urban locationswhere gay lifestyles were already being marketed through venues such as Exit. Thedamning charges of corruption and misuse of funds by key GASA members in1986 were followed by debate over the organization’s support of the NationalParty candidate Leon de Beer from Hillbrow in the 1987 elections.42 By proclaim-ing in the headlines that ‘Election was Gay Victory’ the publishers of Exit wereclearly defining white gay interests in electoral and spatial terms. This announce-ment of the gay ‘community’s’ role in swinging politics was followed by a declara-tion that the ‘community will get a far better deal from the Johannesburg CityCouncil in the future’ and that this is ‘directly attributable to the election resultin Hillbrow and the coming by-election determining who will rule Johannes-burg’.43 Gay voters questioned the candidates belonging to various parties,expressed their concerns about obtaining space for the Gay Advice Bureau andaccessing other city amenities. However, as before, a myopic advocacy of gayrights to city spaces did not include an acknowledgment of restrictions on blackand coloured populations.44 Such blindness was publicly challenged by the WitsGay Movement (WGM), which made it clear that the newspaper and its currenteditor, David Moolman’s support of de Beer and his ‘arrogance’ in claiming tospeak for the entire gay community equated gay rights with white gay rights. AWGM letter in Exit points out that when 25 million people in South Africa aredenied the right to vote, the correct stand should be ‘against racism, sexism, andall forms of discrimination’.45Besides limited voting rights, the National Party’s stand onmaintaining apartheidbrought the Group Areas Act into the limelight at a time when gay voters weredeciding on which candidates would best represent their interests. Despite theawareness that the Group Areas Act privileged white people’s use of city space,Exit made no attempt to address the issue in its list of questions to the party nomi-nees. Calling out this tunnel vision as a sign that the community was distinctlylimited in its outlook, one reader asked: ‘Are we voting for a “Gay GroupArea?” If so, please count me out.’46 The Cape Town based Lesbians and Gaysagainst Oppression or the LAGO collective publicly repudiated Leon de Beer’selection as Nationalist MP in Exit. LAGO pointed out the contradictions in theNational Party’s ideology and in the political awareness of gay voters in Hillbrow:How can anyone committed to democracy support a candidate whose party has been respon-sible inter alia, for the forced removals of thousands of families to enclaves of rural depri-vation, the arbitrary incarceration of hundreds of children and the systematic abuse ofpolice powers with the concomitant abrogation of the rule of law’.47While the Group Areas Act was finally repealed in 1990, GASA and the urban gaycommunity’s avoidance of the race question exposed the faultlines in theKANIKA BATRA44movement. These incidents reveal the failing fortunes and ineffectiveness ofGASA in the late 1980s, an ineffectiveness which was brought to national andinternational attention in the movement’s and its associated publications’ handlingof the Treason Trials involving Simon Nkoli.Queer AfropolitanismWith the official repeal of the Immorality Act in 1985, a new generation of activistscommitted to worlding sexualities through an intersectional anti-apartheid queerpolitics sought to use popular publication avenues such as Exit. One of theleading figures in this move was Simon Nkoli who had been an active memberof GASA from the early 1980s. Establishing L/S and Exit’s presentation of raceis crucial to understand the political divergences within the organization. Evenat its inception, L/S could not afford to be seen as overtly racially biased. Theearly L/S numbers contain articles which purport to understand black gay identitiesand cultures. The newsletter also carried a few racially inclusive advertisementsfrom gay-friendly businesses such as Ebony casual and designer clothing housedin Melville and Browser’s picture framing in Hillbrow.48 Minimally inclusiveones included those by Stud Barn restaurant (racially coded towards a coloured cli-entele) and by Jameson’s bar on Commissioner Street which had applied for an‘international’ license allowing it to serve black customers. Most advertisementswere unambiguous in their preference for white customers, and many did notwelcome women. The suggestive and unabashedly pretentious names—Connec-tions, Chittendales, Saddle, Parzival, Heaven, Butterfly, Cranks, etc.—targetedwhite gay men with sufficient disposable incomes as consumers.Not only the services advertised in its newsletter but also the social activitiesorganized by GASA were often racially exclusive. For instance, an outing orga-nized by the GASA Rand hiking group towards the end of 1983 was critiquedfor being a white only excursion. In response to this criticism, the editor defendsthe exclusivity by stating, ‘The fact that there are no multiracial venues in Pretoriais something that cannot be blamed on Gasa. Even in the Johannesburg area thenumber of venues open to all races can be counted on one hand.’49 These incidentsexposed GASA’s hypocritical claims of being welcoming of all races and renderedsuspect L/S’s goals of serving as a means of gay liberation. Such a stand led toGASA’s internal disagreements with its lesbian and more progressive membersand an embattled relationship with the International Gay Association (laterrenamed the International Lesbian and Gay Association or ILGA). In a chronologi-cal review of this relationship from the later 1980s to the end of the decade, JensRydström observes that when GASA had applied for membership to the IGA in1983, the application had been opposed by the Scottish Human Rights Groups(SHRG) on the grounds that the organization’s politics was not inclusive.50GASA’s representative Pieter Bosman managed to convince IGA to ignoreSHRG recommendations. Ironically, since the majority of IGA members votedin favour of GASA, this was reported as a victory in Exit in the August 1987 head-line ‘International Body Welcomes SA Gays’.51 Rather than take internationalopposition to GASA as a moment for self-reflection and scrutiny, the organizationand the newspaper applauded Bosman and Smith’s lobbying efforts. In 1986, at theWORLDING SEXUALITIES UNDER APARTHEID45insistence of SHRG and some other anti-apartheid groups in ILGA, GASA’s racialpolitics again came under scrutiny. This time the opposition came from Swedishand Scottish groups, and GASA sent Kevan Botha as a representative to preventits expulsion from the organization. Botha’s apparently candid account ofGASA’s multiracial work helped avoid the organization’s expulsion, an accounthe later admitted had been insincere in its representation of GASA’s politicalstand on race and apartheid era exclusions.Behind the scenes others had been working to avoid this expulsion. While indetention as a co-conspirator in the Delmas Treason Trial, Nkoli had written tothe ILGA pleading with them not to expel GASA from its fold. In later yearsthis connection helped the international community become aware of the mutualimbrications of racial and sexual justice, particularly when African LGBT organi-zers, including Nkoli and Sheila Lapinsky, attended the annual ILGA conferences.Phumi Mtetwa, a black lesbian activist, who served with Nkoli on the NationalCoalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality, was elected as Secretary of ILGA from1999 to 2001. Hence the impact of a black South African perspective on ILGAwhich had a predominantly European and North American focus till the mid-1980s cannot be overstated.Nkoli’s involvement with GASA and Exit lasted through his detention from1985 to 1988 in one of the longest running and most widely publicized politicaltrials in South Africa documented in gay as well as mainstream South Africanhistory.52 It brought to international attention GASA’s limited view of justiceand rights. When the organization did comment on the incident, many monthsafter Nkoli’s arrest, it was in a short piece appearing in Exit which justified nottaking an ‘official stance’ since Simon ‘is not detained because of his gay activi-ties’.53 Ann Smith, Chairperson of GASA Rand and International Secretary ofGASA for many years, pointed out the contradictions in the organization’s standand made clear her own position and differences.54 Many lesbians in the movementdid not share the official GASA position that was reflected in the newspaper,despite the claims of the publication being an independent entity. In the late1980s Exit was edited jointly by Karen Lotter and Henk Botha before their dis-agreements over GASA’s racial politics led to the latter giving up his secondstint at editorship.In this context, Nkoli’s founding of the Saturday Group within GASA in 1984signals an emerging queer Afropolitanism that expands the racial and geographicalreach of gay liberation, a worlding of sexualities that was first, simultaneouslylocal, national, and international and next, openly political and community-oriented. From 1984 GASA had taken some note of worlds other than the onein Hillbrow by supplementing the local gay news column ‘Link up’ with onecalled ‘World Link’ containing snippets of gay and lesbian news from internationalsources, indicating an awareness of its role in the global circulation of gay liber-ation literature. In this worldly context where white gay activism was increasinglybecoming untenable, a small inconspicuous notice placed by ‘Simon and Roy’ inL/S announced: ‘Gays of all races, sexes, ages and creeds are welcome.’55 TheSaturday Group soon acquired its own offices and planned a series of activitieswhich involved not just people living in Johannesburg but also township andhomeland areas. The group’s practices of socialization were markedly differentKANIKA BATRA46from that of the white gay community, sometimes leading to hostility between themore established GASA members and those belonging to the Saturday Club. AfterNkoli’s acquittal in the Treason Trials, the Saturday Group resumed its activities.There is little coverage of this in Exit except through very brief letters sent byreaders.Nkoli formed the Johannesburg and Soweto Working Group, which was the pre-cursor of the GLOW on his release and acquittal. The new organization wasfounded on principles of fulfilling the educational, cultural, and social needs ofthe black lesbian and gay community. One of the crucial aspects of queer politicsin this period is a realization that city spaces cannot exclusively encompass gay andlesbian activism and that worlding sexualities involves work beyond the Afropolis.The reclamation of a black queer identity from a predominantly white GASAmeant reaching out to people of all races living in the city and outside it, in town-ships such as Soweto and Kwa-Thema. To this end the 1988 celebration of GayPride by GLOW included a meeting for support for Ivan Toms, a gay activist, atthe University of Witwatersrand, a drag show, and a braai, dance, and poetryreading at a private house.56The definitional correlates of queer embraced by GLOW derived as much fromAfrican social realities as they did from the emerging models of activism by NorthAmerican groups such as AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in the late1980s and Queer Nation in the 1990s. Karen Lotter mentions Nkoli’s 1989 trip toLondon, from where he went to Vienna to attend the ILGA meeting, and then toCanada and US to raise money for the Township AIDS Project.57 This historyof exchange and influence is part of GLOW’s international connections maintainedby visits abroad and exchange of information about the global LGBT movementthat was taking on a different face in the wake of the AIDS crisis. GLOW’sefforts to address the crisis reflected awareness of queer activism in NorthAmerica but also a recognition that the situation in South Africa demanded a differ-ent response. In these ways it differed from GASA’s response to the crisis. MandisaMbali notes in her account of South African AIDS activism that GASA circulatedinformation about AIDS through its publications and at its meetings but did notaddress the issue politically, and that there was some disagreement amongst itsmembers and the publications as to the urgency of the crisis. Additionally,GASA opted to collaborate with the apartheid regime’s ministry of health as arepresentative gay organization at a time when other organizations refused collab-orations with the state.58In contrast to GASA’s model of gay liberation, Nkoli and GLOW’s queer Afro-politanism involved an effort to connect races, genders, classes, within and beyondthe nation when the apartheid regime was beginning to unravel. Because of itswork with non-urban, underprivileged gay, lesbian, and transgender peopleliving under threat of isolation, violence, and disease, this politics also came tobe called the gay Left in South Africa. GLOW members’ non-metropolitan back-ground was one of the reasons for this focus. The varied worldly geography ofGLOW’s activities (by 1991 it had branches in Kwa-Thema, Tembisa, Soweto,and Johannesburg) is reflected in Nkoli’s ‘Open Letter to Nelson Mandela’ forthe Village Voice, reprinted by Exit. He attempts to make the leader understand‘what it means to be a gay or lesbian person in the townships’ and establishes aWORLDING SEXUALITIES UNDER APARTHEID47direct link to the situation under apartheid where people, feeling unsafe in theirhome communities, ‘are moving into the so-called “grey areas” of the whitecities, which also happen to be gay areas’. In a savvy move that connects thelocal to the global or South Africa to the world, Nkoli reminds Mandela of hispromises to secure ‘the rights of all people’ on a visit to the Township AIDSProject in Soweto, of his support for gay rights in a meeting in Stockholm, andof the promises made by Mandela’s close colleagues, Thabo Mbeki and FreneGinwala, who had publicly declared outside of South Africa that gay rightswould be secured by the African National Congress (ANC).59Finally, the emergence of local, national, and international queer Afropolitanismof the kind articulated by lesbian women in GASA, Nkoli, Beverley Ditsie, andGLOW in Johannesburg and surrounding areas also arose due to a vacuum ingay and lesbian organizing in the wake of GASA-era politics. As reported inExit, Alfred Machela, a black activist, had started the Rand Gay Organization(RGO) when Nkoli was in prison. But the RGO was ineffective, practically invis-ible, and deemed suspect by the late 1980s. Thus GLOW emerged as the naturalleader for organizing the first ever Gay Pride Parade in October 1990.60 Theroute charted for the parade from Braamfontein to Hillbrow symbolized the edu-cational, commercial, and social needs of the gay and lesbian community in Johan-nesburg, and asserted that people of all races and beliefs had a claim to this vibrantAfropolis.The assumption that visibility characterizing annual Pride in Johannesburg in the1990s made the city and its surroundings safer for gays and lesbians is belied bynews coverage in mainstream and gay media of this period. Exit reported manyincidents of homophobic violence when a national collation of gay and lesbiangroups was being planned to place sexual equality in the draft South African con-stitution. Reid and Dersuweit mention that the visibility of gay men and lesbianwomen may have contributed to the rise in gay bashing. This is borne out by Bev-erley Ditsie’s memory of the first Pride Parade which made her a public figure andhence subject to homophobic threats in her Soweto neighbourhood.61 In 1996South Africa became the first nation in the world to constitutionally guaranteenon-discrimination to its gay and lesbian citizens through what came to becalled the Equality Clause, the result of a complex process of negotiationsbetween gay and lesbian activists and the ANC, with support from the legal com-munity. Studies conducted on the incidence of homophobic violence in Johannes-burg and its environs in the post-apartheid era after this constitutional mandateconclude that the city remains a ‘homophobic landscape’ and that further ‘investi-gations need to be embedded in discussions of the complexity and suppleness ofgay urban politics in Johannesburg’.62 Xavier Livermon’s account of blackqueer bodies’ estrangement from freedoms enabled by the constitution, though itdoes not explicitly deal with urban geography, mentions that this estrangement‘cannot be resolved at the state level but must occur in communities that ultimatelycan provide safety and security to black queers and thus make the rights of the con-stitution meaningful’.63 Resonating with Brenna Munro’s call of a ‘queer SouthAfrican sexual politics’ that offers an ‘alternative to the current global and nationalstatus quo, speaking back to a postaparthied social order that might prefer gays andlesbians to remain mutely happy emblems of the new nation’,64 my submission isKANIKA BATRA48that the exceptionality of constitutional and legislative successes and the unexcep-tionality of sexual violence in South Africa are future projects for a postcolonialqueer historical enquiry.In conclusion, sidestepping GASA-era politics, gay liberation moved toward aqueer Afropolitanism in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, rather than tran-sitioning from gay liberation to queer liberation literature, Exit lapsed into an info-mercial tabloid still in circulation. Despite this disappointing trajectory, theJohannesburg based gay journalism of the 1980s emphasizes connections thatcomplicate a one way North–South comparison. Many of these comparisonspresent LGBTQ mobilizing in the North as emulated in the South with few orno legislative gains.65 Within South African gay social formations there was andremains modelling and inter-referencing of Northern gay urbanisms and modesof protest, but there is also localized Southern consciousness addressing exclusionsthrough legal reform, and modes of racial, class, and gender inclusivity, thatextended sexual rights awareness beyond the gay world of Johannesburg. GASAlesbians and GLOW’s invocation of and departure from Northern and internationalqueer activism stands out as exceptional not only in the gains secured at the turn ofthe twentieth century but also in its ability to inflect international sexual rights acti-vism with racial and geographical specificities. Engendered in Hillbrow, butspreading beyond it to embrace the racially, geographically, culturally diverseworlding of spatiality and sexuality in print, this queer Afropolitanism emergedin the face of obstacles encountered, overcome,66 and still faced by those tirelesslyworking to secure justice and rights for sexual minorities in the global South.67Notes on contributorKanika Batra is Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies at the Department of English, Texas TechUniversity where she teaches and researches Postcolonial Feminism, Postcolonial Queer Studies, Globalization,and Urban Studies.

These include GALA, Forum for the Empowerment of Women (FEW) in Braamfontein,the Gay Boxing Group, and the Gay and Lesbian Legal Advice Centre in Yeoville. Additionally there areseveral health-based organizations with centres or branches in Soweto such as SOHACA (Soweto HIV/AIDS Health Counsellors Association) and Health4Men with clinics in and around Johannesburg. The exhibi-tion, Joburg Tracks: Sexuality in the City, developed by GALA in 2008, is now permanently housed atMuseum Africa in Newtown, Johannesburg.2 There is a wealth of scholarship on North–South interactions in studies of sexuality.

See Graeme Reid andTeresa Dirsuweit, ‘Understanding Systemic Violence: Homophobic Attacks in Johannesburg and Its Sur-rounds’, Urban Forum, 13(3), 2002, pp 99–126; Xavier Livermon, ‘Queer(y)ing Freedom: Black Queer Vis-ibilities in Postapartheid South Africa’, GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, 18(2–3), 2012, pp 297–323; Andrew Tucker, Queer Visibilities: Space, Identity, and Interaction in Cape Town, Oxford: Wiley-Black-well, 2009. Gay newsletters and newspapers, such as Link/Skakel and Exit, are therefore valuable sources foranalysing the situation during apartheid.18 Loren Kruger, Imagining the Edgy City: Writing, Performing, and Building Johannesburg, Oxford: OxfordUniversity Press, 2013, p 3.KANIKA BATRA5019 In chronological order, these are: Mandy, A City Divided; Lindsay Bremner, ‘Reinventing the JohannesburgInner City’, Cities, 17(3), 2000, pp 185–193; Jo Beall, Owen Crankshaw, and Susan Parnell, Uniting aDivided City: Governance and Social Exclusion in Johannesburg, London: Earthscan, 2002; Keith Beavon,Johannesburg: The Making and Shaping of a City, Pretoria: University of South Africa Press, 2005; and Vla-dislavic’s Portrait with Keys.20 According to Ong, this trajectory has shifted in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, such that themodelling and inter-referencing is now between cities in the global South.21 The system of rigid racial classification was introduced by the Populations Registration Act of 1950. The SouthAfrican population was divided into three racial groups: ‘White’, ‘Black’ (‘African’, ‘Native’, and/or ‘Bantu’)and ‘Coloured’; further subcategorized into ‘Cape Malay’, ‘Griqua’, ‘Indian’, ‘Chinese’, and ‘Cape Coloured’.These classifications were repealed by the Parliament in 1991.22 Hoad, African Intimacies, p 72.23 Mandy, A City Divided, p 89.24 Kruger, Imagining the Edgy City, p 22.25 Mandy, A City Divided, p 160.26 Beall, Crankshaw, and Parnell, Uniting a Divided City, p 112.27 ‘Gays Link Up’, Link/Skakel (Johannesburg), May 1982, pp 1–2.28 Mark Gevisser, ‘A Different Fight for Freedom: A History of South African Lesbian and Gay Organisationfrom the 1950s to the 1990s’, in Edwin Cameron and Mark Gevisser (eds), Defiant Desire: Gay andLesbian Lives in South Africa, New York: Routledge, 1994, pp 14–86.29 ‘Dial Pink’, Link/Skakel (Johannesburg), May 1982, p 2.30 Graeme Reid, How to Be a Real Gay: Gay Identities in Small-town South Africa, Durban: University ofKwaZulu-Natal Press, 2013.31 See John D’Emilio, Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities: The Making of a Homosexual Minority in the UnitedStates, 1940–1970, 2nd Edition, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998.

For Currier and Migraine-George, ‘the “victimage” produced by discourses of “African homophobia”stems from a particular intersection of area and sexuality studies: cynicism about African sociopolitical con-ditions and confining portrayals of lived gender and sexual diversity’, ‘Queer Studies/African Studies: An (Im)possible Transaction?’, GLQ, 22(2), 2016, pp 281, 282.35 While I use the term ‘community’ in this section, any notion of the gay community invoked by L/S and Exitmust take into account the exclusions already mentioned: white lesbians; black and coloured gays and lesbians;transgendered people of all races; those living in townships surrounding Johannesburg; and those who couldnot access the club and café culture thriving in Hillbrow and its environs because of their limited purchasingpower.36 Urvashi Vaid, Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation, New York: Anchor-Dou-bleday, 1995, p 60.37 Michael, ‘You and the Law’, Link/Skakel (Johannesburg), October 1982, p 7; ‘You and the Law 2’, Link/Skakel(Johannesburg), November 1982, p 7; ‘You and the Law 3’, Link/Skakel (Johannesburg), December 1982, p 7;‘You and the Law 4’, Link/Skakel (Johannesburg), January 1983, p 9; ‘You and the Law 5’, Link/Skakel (Johan-nesburg), February 1983, p 11.38 Michael, ‘You and the Law 8’, Link/Skakel (Johannesburg), June 1983, p 11.39 ‘Exit Link/Skakel Enter Exit’, Link/Skakel (Johannesburg), July 1985, p 1.40 ‘Law Affects All’, Exit (Johannesburg), October 1985, p 5.41 Gevisser, ‘A Different Fight for Freedom’, p 61, my emphasis.WORLDING SEXUALITIES UNDER APARTHEID5142 Daniel Conway offers an illuminating account of the controversy by using Exit as a key source for his con-clusions in ‘Queering Apartheid: The National Party’s 1987 “Gay Rights” Election Campaign in Hillbrow’,Journal of Southern African Studies, 35(4), 2009, pp 849–863.43 ‘Election Was Gay Victory’, Exit (Johannesburg), June/July 1987, p 1.44 ‘Hillbrow Can Be Key for Rights’, Exit (Johannesburg), May/June 1987, p 1.45 Wits Gay Movement, ‘WGM Stand Clear’, Exit (Johannesburg), June/July 1987, p 2.46 Christopher Lorentz, ‘Discrimination Abhorrent’, Exit (Johannesburg), July/August 1987, p 2.47 LAGO Collective, ‘Misplaced’, Exit (Johannesburg), July/August 1987, p 2.48 Ebony’s ad shows a stylized black and white shaded male torso.

    "abstract": "Examining gay journalism as gay liberation literature, this essay forwards a cultural history of sexuality informed by comparative urban and queer studies. My main argument is that gay liberation literature under apartheid lags behind important shifts in sexual activism; and my larger aim is to extend the valences of postcolonial queer studies towards a historical examination of North–South interactions in theorizing sexual activism. Gay liberation literature here refers to texts which contributed to the emergence of gay and lesbian sexualities in South Africa, including works of fiction, poetry,\ndrama, anthologies as well as newsletters, newspapers, and newsletters. The primary archive used as an example of gay liberation literature is Link/Skakel, the official newsletter of the GASA, which later became a mainstream gay newspaper\ncalled Exit",
