We\nhave included the reports in the form they were submitted by the authors.  No additional\ncopyediting or typesetting has been done to them.\nExecutive Summary\nEthnocentrism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and homophobia remain the crucial problems in the public\nsphere in Lithuania. The Lithuanian media still tend to perpetuate discrimination and hostility against\nethnic and sexual minorities. Minority groups share relative invisibility and one-sided stereotypical\nrepresentations. By not paying nearly enough attention to ethnic and sexual minorities in the everyday\nsituations, the Lithuanian press and television participate in their marginalization.\nThis paper describes how the Lithuanian mass media represent ethnic and sexual minorities. It proposes\npolicy-oriented recommendations on how to change popular media representations of ethnic and sexual\ngroups. The proposed measures include:\n? The establishment of a monitoring group that is to conduct a continued analysis of the portrayals\nof ethnic and sexual minorities in various media\n? The promotion of a multicultural approach to program content and the avoidance of programs that\npresent society in mono-cultural and mono-linguistic terms\n? The formulation of more elaborate recommendations and guidelines for the coverage of ethnic and\nsexual minorities\n? The organization of seminars and training courses for media professionals on the subject of\ntolerance and multiculturalism\n? The enhancement of professional training of Lithuanian journalists, multicultural awareness and\ncontinuing on-the-job monitoring of professional practice.\n? The organization of periodical publicity campaigns to expose media discrimination against ethnic\nand sexual minorities and to highten the public awareness of media images that are insulting and\ndemeaning to minorities\nEthnic and sexual minorities share relative invisibility and demeaning stereotypes in the Lithuanian mass\nmedia. Although the media can be an important means of combating aggressive nationalism, ethnocentrism\nand homophobia, the Lithuanian media still tend to perpetuate discrimination and hostility against\nminorities. The media generally plays insufficient attention to the problems encountered by ethnic and\nsexual minorities.\nThe question of visibility has always been crucial for ethnic and sexual minority groups since visibility and\ninclusion can translate their views and concerns into issues of public interest. By gaining publicity in the\nmainstream Lithuanian mass media they can gain access to the sites of public policy formation and agenda-\nsetting.\nIn this paper, I will describe how the Lithuanian mass media represent ethnic and sexual minorities. There\nare differences as well as similarities in the ways these two minority groups are treated in the media.\nTherefore, I will propose two separate sets of policy-oriented recommendations on how to change popular\nmedia representations of ethnic and sexual groups.\nBackground\n1. Legal Framework: Laws on Ethnic Minorities. Sexual Minorities in Lithuania\n1.1 Ethnic Minorities in Lithuania\nEthnic minorities now account for about 20 percent of the population of Lithuania (around 746,000).\nAround 109 different nationalities and ethnicities live in Lithuania, including Russians, Poles,\nBelorussians, Ukrainians, Jews, Tatars, Latvians, Gypsies, Germans, Armenians, Uzbeks, Azerbaijanis,\nGeorgians, Estonians, Karaites, Greeks and Hungarians. The data from the Statistical Yearbook of\nLithuania (Vilnius 1989) show that Russians comprise 8.2%, Poles – 6.9%, Belorussians – 1.5%,\nUkrainians – 1.0%, Jews – 0.1%.[1] The greatest number of non-Lithuanians lives in eastern and\nsoutheastern part of Lithuania and in the cities of Vilnius, Klaipeda and Visaginas.\nTo support the cultures of ethnic minorities, and to design and execute national policy towards them, the\nDepartment of National Minorities and Émigrés for the Government of the Republic of Lithuania was\nestablished in 1990. It monitors the implementation of legislation and international provisions affecting\nminorities and co-ordinates activities that concern them. The Department works in conjunction with\nvarious foundations and ministries – particularly the Ministries of Education, Culture and the Interior –\nattempting to resolve the problems facing minorities.\nThe Department of National Minorities and Émigrés cooperates with the national communities and their\norganizations in Lithuania. The House of National Communities and the Council of National Communities\nfunction within the framework of the Department. By 2000, 19 different nationalities residing in Lithuania\nestablished their own non-governmental organizations. The most active national and ethnic minority\norganizations include the Russian Cultural Center, the Lithuanian Russian Community, the Union of\nLithuanian Poles, the Jewish Community of Lithuania, and the Association of Lithuanian Roma. It should\nbe mentioned that in 1998 the Roma Information Bureau was opened. It oversees social, cultural and\neducational issues of Roma people.[2]\nWhile both the Department and minority organizations have attempted to improve the situation of ethnic\nminorities in Lithuania, they have failed to promote the wider participation of ethnic minorities in public\nlife and toimplement a coordinated and comprehensive policy dealing with mass media and minority\ngroups. Policies specifically regarding the media laws and promoting an adequate minority representation\nin mass media have not been developed. The purpose of my policy paper is make public interest groups\nand governmental agencies think systematically about the strength and inadequacies of the Lithuanian mass\nmedia, its contexts, institutions as well as to find ways to influence media policies and practices.\n1.2 Legal provisions concerning ethnic minorities\nIt has been argued that media production is shaped by prevailing state policies and socio-political responses\nto ethnic minorities.[3] What laws and state initiatives shape the lives of ethnic minorities in Lithuania?\nLithuania has a general system for the protection of minorities: the Constitution of the Republic of\nLithuania (articles 37 and 45) guarantees political, social and economic rights to its citizens regardless their\nethnic background. Similarly, the Law on National Minorities in Lithuania ratified by the Lithuanian\nParliament on November 23, 1989, guarantees “equal political, economic and social rights and freedoms to\nall its citizens regardless of ethnicity,” and recognizes and respects “their ethnic identity, the continuity of\ntheir culture and …  promote[s] ethnic consciousness and its self-expression.” Lithuania acknowledges the\nrights of national and ethnic minorities to education, native language, religion, and culture. They have the\nright to preserve, develop and express their ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identities.\nThe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities was ratified in February 2000 and\nenacted in July 2000.\nLithuania is a member of the UN, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and other international organizations.\nIn 1995 the Lithuanian Parliament ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights\nand Fundamental Freedoms, and its protocols No. 4, 7, and 11.\nLegal protection and full citizenship rights, however, offer ethnic minorities little guarantee of protection\nfrom intolerant and chauvinistic sentiments in the Lithuanian media. While laws play a crucial role as a\nmeans of implementing policy change, they are unable to contain the implicit and open forms of\nintolerance, racism and xenophobia.\n1.3 Sexual Minorities in Lithuania\nBefore 1989, the words “gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender” were rarely heard in Lithuania. For a long\ntime, homosexuality was a completely taboo subject, to be spoken about in only the most reluctant way.\nThe situation changed after Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. With the\nadvent of a new press and television, the problem of homosexuality, and sexuality in general, came to be\ndiscussed publicly. From 1995 onwards coverage of sexual minorities in the mass media increased\nsignificantly due to a higher visibility of Lithuanian gay activists. But only from 1998 were sexual\nminorities covered more intensively, particularly in the Lithuanian press.[4] Sexual minorities, however,\nare virtually invisible on television. If visible, they are usually shown in comic stereotyped settings in\nsitcoms and comedy shows.\nThe first gay organization, the Lithuanian Gay League (LGL) was publicly registered in 1995. It remains\nthe most important and active advocacy group for sexual minorities in Lithuania. The group publishes a\nnewsletter entitled “LGL žinios” [LGL News] and runs a website and telephone hotline. Beside the\nLithuanian Gay League, currently, there exist two other gay and lesbian organizations, SAPPHO\n(Lithuanian Lesbian League) and KASLO (Movement for Sexual Equality of the Kaunas County), in\nLithuania.\nIndependent Lithuania inherited the Soviet prejudice on homosexuality. Despite the existence of\nconstitutional guarantees of equality and privacy, the infamous article of the Penal Code (122 BK) against\nconsensual sex between adult men was repealed only in 1993. Lithuania was the last among the three Baltic\ncountries to abolish penalties for homosexual acts. Only in the new Penal Code to be approved this year by\nthe Lithuanian parliament sexual orientation may be included as a criterion for protection from\ndiscrimination (Articles 160 and 161).[5]\nA substantial majority of Lithuanians hold very negative views of gays and lesbians. An opinion poll\nshowed that in 1999 78.2% of Lithuanians did not tolerate homosexuality. Only 67.8 of respondents would\nwant to live with homosexual neighbors, while 87.5% would rather live with drug-addicts.[6] It is one of\nthe lowest levels of acceptance of homosexuals in Europe. After a virtual chat of the Lithuanian public with\nthe founder of a gay club Men’s Factory Aleksei Terentiev, there arose an intense discussion about\nLithuanian gays. Responses of most writers revealed that the majority of the population did not tolerate\ngays. “People suggested that gays should move to the Moon.” A Lithuanian daily Vakaro žinios (The\nEvening News)concluded that “Most Lithuanian Hate Gays.”[7] In such homophobic atmosphere a policy\nprocess concerning sexual minorities and the media requires an active involvement of both minority\norganizations and journalists.\n1.4 Media Legislation\nThe Lithuanian constitution guarantees freedom of expression and the right to disseminate information or\nideas. The article 25 of the Constitution states that media freedom cannot be restricted “in any way other\nthan as established by law, when it is necessary to safeguard the health, honor, dignity, private life or\nmorals of a person, or to protect constitutional order.” Restrictions on either print or broadcast media are\nprohibited unless the government determines that national security is threatened.\nBesides the Constitution, the Media Law regulates the mass media in Lithuania. The Lithuanian Media\nLaw (The Law on the Provision of Information to the Public) was ratified in 1996 and since then\nunderwent several revisions. It provides for the freedom and independence of the press and broadcasting.\nThis law includes two important articles: 1) Journalists have to observe the provisions of the Code of\nEthics; and 2) The Office of the Inspector of Journalistic Ethics is to be set up.\nThe Lithuanian Media Law also outlines the commitment of the media to public service, defined in terms\nof not discriminating between different sections of the population, covering public issues and providing\nopportunity for the presentation of contrasting points of view. As the law states, the media “shall respect\nthe freedom of speech, creativity, conscience and diversity of opinion” and “help develop democracy and\nopenness of society.”[8]\nIn 1997, Lithuania ratified the Convention of the European Council on Television Without Borders. The\n1995 resolution of the Parliament stated that journalists had to follow the main ethical principles in\naccordance with Resolution No. 1003 of the European Council Parliamentary Assembly. The provisions of\nthis resolution have formed a base for the Lithuanian Code of Ethics for Journalists and Publishers. The\nCode of Ethics is a fundamental element in the system of self-regulation of Lithuanian journalism.\nThe most important agencies of media self-regulation in Lithuania are the Ethics Commission, the Radio\nand Television Commission, the Council of Lithuanian National Radio and Television and the Foundation\nfor the Support of Press, Radio and Television. The members of these organizations are appointed by the\nmedia industry and various public non-political organizations.\nGovernment laws and regulations affect all aspects of media production. Best known are the legal\nregulations on the content of media. The Lithuanian media law prohibits the dissemination of pornographic\nmaterials. The dissemination of publications of erotic or violent content is restricted by the decree of the\nGovernment. If the need arises, the Ethics Commission of Journalists and Publishers could decide whether\nthe medium in question is pornographic, erotic or propagating violence. The media law also prohibits the\ndistribution of information that “incite[s] war, national, racial and religious enmity.”[9]\nThe Lithuanian Code of Ethics for Journalists and Publishers states that “the journalist shall not humiliate\nor mock the individual’s family name, race, nationality, religious convictions, age, sex or physical\ndeficiencies even if such individual has committed a crime.”[10]\nNeither the above organizations, nor the legal provisions concerning the mass media guarantee compliance.\nThe Lithuanian media practitioners do not always understand their responsibility for their work. The\ndifference between normative laws and the everyday reality of the mass media is obvious. It is fair to argue\nthat although the doctrine of social responsibility assumes independent power for the mass media, the press\nand broadcasts serve the interests of the powerful far more than those of the powerless. The mass media are\na battleground between powerful political and commercial interests. Often political and commercial\nalliances are made to control media outlets and intervene in the formation of public knowledge. Although\nthe Lithuanian media are not subject to any political censorship, they are highly competitive and\npoliticized.[11]\nFurthermore, neither the Lithuanian media law, nor the Code of Ethics for Journalists and Publishers\nincludes any provisions or guidelines detailing the status of disadvantaged minority groups. Minors are the\nonly protected group in the Lithuanian media legislation. My research proves that such detailed guidelines\nfor the coverage of ethnic and sexual minorities are necessary and should be developed.\nMedia, Representation and the Public Sphere\nAmong numerous newspapers and magazines (around 300 titles), two Lithuanian dailies Lietuvos rytas\n(The Morning of Lithuania) and Respublika (The Republic) dominate the national scene. Two tabloid\ndailies Lietuvos žinios (Lithuanian News) and Vakaro žinios (The Evening News) also boast a wide\nreadership (due in part to their low price). All these newspapers are privately owned and operated.\nThe private commercial TV stations TV3, LNK and BTV operate three out of four national TV networks in\nLithuania. Lithuania has one public broadcaster – the Lithuanian Radio and Television Company (LRT)\nfinanced from the state budget, license fee and advertising. Management of LRT is accountable to the\nParliament via the board selected by public organizations and state institutions.\nLithuania is becoming an increasingly media-dependant society. Consumers of the mass media comprise a\nlarge part of the Lithuanian population. The latest polls conducted in 2001 show that Lithuanian citizens\nrely on the mass media as their most significant source of information. Indeed, 61.5 % of the Lithuanian\npublic trusts the Lithuanian mass media, ‘the fourth estate of the realm’, more than any other instititution\nexcept the Church (68.3 % of Lithuanians trust the Church most).[12] The mass media are in this context\nparticularly significant, because they provide a common stock of information and culture.\nThe mass media exert an immense influence on the defining, structuring, and delimiting of public discourse\nand in forming and influencing public knowledge. Articulating, developing and disseminating the ideas of\nethnicity and sexuality, the mass media help to shape attitudes about ethnic and sexual minorities. As\nCharles Husband suggested, the power of the media “to promote and sustain ideologies of domination and\nsubordination through their representation of ethnic [and sexual] identities, and through the construction of\nthe definition of the situation within which ethnic [and sexual] diversity in society should be understood” is\nimmense.[13]\nThe question of representation is a critical arena of contestation and struggle over the monopoly of the\npower to impose a certain vision of a social world and to establish meaning and consensus about\nmeaning.[14] Hence, non-recognition or misrecognition of a certain group can be “a form of oppression,\nimprisoning someone in a false, distorted, and reduced mode of being.”[15] This means that misrecognition\nor non-recognition of ethnic and sexual minorities in the mass media is a discursive form of racism,\nhomophobia and victimization. Non-representation in the mediated ‘reality’ of our mass culture maintains\nthe powerless status of groups that do not possess significant material or political power bases. As Geneva\nSmitherman-Donaldson and Teun A. van Dijk pointed out, it is through discourse that dominant groups and\ninstitutions discriminate against minority groups.[16] Many forms of contemporary racism, sexism and\nhomophobia are discursive: “they are expressed, enacted and confirmed by text and talk” far removed from\nthe open violence. They, however, may be just as effective to marginalize and exclude minorities.[17]\nThe issue of representation is closely related to the concept of the public sphere through which much of the\nstudy of mass media and democracy has been framed. Peter Dahlgren has pointed out that the dimension of\nrepresentation in the public sphere “points to such basic questions as what should be selected for portrayal\nand how should it be presented.”[18] In other words, what should or should not be portrayed or represented\nabout ethnic and sexual minorities in the Lithuanian mass media? Which and how many representations of\nthese minorities should be permitted in the Lithuanian mass media?\nWhat is at stake here is the struggle over the public sphere, “where members of subordinated social groups\ninvent and circulate counter-discourses, so as to formulate oppositional interpretations of their identities,\ninterests and needs.”[19] Thus, the problem of representations of minorities central to a consideration of\nthe mass media as both an ongoing problem and possibility for democracy points to the problems of the\npublic sphere and citizenship in the Lithuanian society.\nSexual and Ethnic Minorities in the Lithuanian Mass Media\nThe problems of xenophobia, racism and homophobia in the Lithuanian mass media remain severe. An\ninternational seminar in 1999 in Vilnius entitled “Promotion of Tolerance in Central and Eastern Europe”\nconcluded that the Lithuanian mass media depict ethnic minorities in terms of a restricted repertoire of\nstereotypical representations. Similar conclusion was reached by the participats of a seminar “Ethnic\nGroups in a Democratic Society: Public Discourse, the Marginalized and Conspicuous in Contemporary\nLithuania” which took place in January, 2002.[20]\nMy research conducted in 2001 corroborates the above views. It is suffice to mention the Lithuanian daily\nLietuvos Aidas (The Echo of Lithuania) which published two strongly anti-Semitic articles on October 19,\n2000. The articles emphasized the Jewish roots of Karl Marx and accused Jews of creating Communism.\nThe daily questioned the need to prosecute war criminals who participated in Holocaust. Lietuvos Aidas\nalso called for an international tribunal to investigate the “crimes against humanity committed by Jews”\nduring the Soviet period.[21] Homophobic comments occur frequently in the Lithuanian press and\ntelevision.\nDespite the mentioned seminars and incidents of open anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia in the\nLithuanian mass media, the production, circulation and consumption of media representations of ethnic and\nsexual minorities have been inadequately analyzed in Lithuania. There have been very few studies on\nLithuanian media portrayals of ethnic minorities over the last ten years.[22] Moreover, research on the\nportrayals of sexual minorities in mass media is non-existant in Lithuania. The construction and\nfunctioning of the representations of homosexuals in the mass media have not been subjected to intensive\nacademic scrutiny.\nMy research and policy recommendations intend to fill this gap. In my research, I analyzed a total of 119\nnews stories and reports about homosexuality and homosexuals in four mainstream Lithuanian dailies\nLietuvos Rytas (the biggest mainstream daily), Respublika (the second biggest newspaper), Lietuvos žinios\n(tabloid) and Vakaro žinios (the most popular tabloid) during the period of January I, 2000- June, 2001.\nVakaro žinios, a tabloid immensely popular in Lithuania, carried 44 stories and articles, Lietuvos rytas was\nnot far behind (38 articles), Respublika published 21 news report and article, and Lietuvos žinios, 16. I also\nsampled a continuous week of television coverage of ethnic and sexual minorities. During the sampled\nweek (November 26- December 2), gays were featured only in an evening magazine devoted to crimes\n“Procesas. X sektorius” (The Process. X Sector), a talk showPrašau žodžio (Let’s Talk) and comedy shows\n“Tegyvuoja karalius!” (Long Live the King) and“Šapro šou” (Šapro show).\nIn the case of ethnic minorities, I examined the representations of four ethnic groups, Russians, Poles,\nRoma people and Jews, living in Lithuania[23], by the largest Lithuanian daily Lietuvos rytas from\nNovember 27, 2000, to May 9, 2001.[24]Lietuvos Rytas carried a total of 88 news stories and articles that\nmentioned Lithuanian Russians, Poles, Jews and Roma people. Most stories touched upon the subject of\nJews and the Holocaust in Lithuania (37), Lithuanian Russians attracted 22 reports, Poles, 10, and Romani,\n18.[25] During the sampled week, there was no mention of Lithuanian Russians, Poles, Jews and Romani\nin the primetime news. Only one story related to a Jewish criminal was broadcast in the newsmagazine\n“Sroves” (Trends), and the comedy show “ZbTV” featured the main character of the Polish origin named\nZbignievas.\nFocusing on closer rhetorical analysis of images of ethnic and sexual minorities, I examined how the\nLithuanain press and TV understand, define and deal with ethnic and sexual differences. What beliefs,\nknowledge, attitudes, norms and values underlie the media rhetoric? What major topics are associated with\neach particular ethnic group and sexual minorities? What is omitted and what is published in the stories\nabout ethnic and sexual groups and their relationships?\nThe Lithuanian press and television do not present a uniform conception of the issue ofethnic and sexual\nminorities. My research demonstrated that there is a lack of in-depth reporting on ethnic and sexual groups\nin the Lithuanian mass media. Minority groups share relative invisibility and one-sided stereotypical\nrepresentations. Representations, though primarily discursive, have real material consequences and\ncorrelates. It can be argued that by not paying nearly enough attention to ethnic and sexual minorities in the\neveryday situations, the Lithuanian mass media participate in their marginalization.\n1. Sexual Minorities\nSexual minorities remain a difficult topic and an extremely sensitive issue since it deals with societal\nvalues, norms and sexuality. Therefore, homosexuality is frequently described as a scandal, and\nhomosexuals are still portrayed as an underworld unfamiliar to mass population.\nGays and lesbians are described as outcasts and perverts in society. Homosexuality is still strongly\nassociated with sexual promiscuity and deviance. Although there is little violently abusive terminology in\nLithuanian newspapers, the trend is to ridicule and diminish homosexuals.\nAn analysis of a sample of evening news programs broadcast on LRT (Lithuanian Public Television), and\nthree commercial networks LNK, TV-3 and BTV from 26 November to 1 December 2001, revealed that\ngay issues were nearly invisible. Gay views were not presented. TV entertainment programs emphasized\nthe comic and ridiculous sides of gay characters. This consistent reflection of stereotyped representations\nof gays and lesbians was further reinforced by the virtual absence of alternative role models to counteract\nthe stereotype.\nThe Lithuanian press and TV have been very slow to validate news about gay issues. The media generally\nplayed insufficient attention to the problems and discrimination suffered by sexual minorities. Serious\nrepresentations of homosexuals as minorities were infrequent. Gay events and opinions covered in the\npapers and on television were overwhelmingly trivialized.\nIt is symptomatic that when asked whether the Lithuanian mass media adequately, objectively, and\ncomprehensively cover the life of Lithuanian and foreign gays and lesbians, 84% of respondents who\nidentified themselves as gay or bisexual responded negatively.[26]\n2. Ethnic minorities\nAccording to my analysis, the low numbers and visibility of Romani, Poles, Russians and Jews in the press\nand on television are also at issue. Close reading of the most popular daily and TV programs reveals\nundercurrent xenophobia in a large part of news reports and broadcasts. The “bad news” focus is\noverwhelming: most newspaper reports and TV broadcasts focus on some minority member who\ncommitted a crime. Much less attention is paid to stories about minorities experiencing problems,\nprejudice, racism or unemployment.\nRoma people merit the worst representations as the least socially integrated, criminal and exotic group. The\npress frequently refers to the Roma minority as criminal, deviant, socially insecure, inscrutable, and\nmanipulative. In the police reports published in the newspaper Lietuvos rytas, the ethnicity of Roma is\nalways emphasized.\nRussians receive mixed coverage. On the one hand, they are shown as active participants in Lithuanian\npolitical life. On the other hand, their political behavior is described as threatening and serving the interests\nof foreign powers. As in the case of the Roma, news reports about crimes stress the Russian nationality of\ncriminals. Lietuvos Rytas proves Teun A. van Dijk’s contention that in the press ethnic minorities are\n“systematically associated with conflict, crime, intolerance and [unreliability]” (as we saw in the case of\nRoma people and Russians).[27]\nThe representations of the Polish minority in the press focus on the extremely politicized problem of\neducation. From these representations, Poles emerge as a self-conscious national minority that requires\nspecial status and rights.\nJews receive the most multi-sided coverage in the biggest Lithuanian daily: coverage of Jewish-related\nissues ranges from detailed descriptions of anti-Semitism in Lithuanian society to news about Jewish\ncelebrations and cultural events, from Holocaust commemorations to the trials of war criminals. However,\nJews remain relatively invisible on the Lithuanian television.\n3. Conclusion\nIt can be argued that the Lithuanian mass media describe ethnicity and homosexuality as problematic and\nnot as a positive quality of a multicultural society. Constituting a presumed threat to the “natural” social\norder, these groups are inherently problematic and controversial for the Lithuanian mass media. Minority\nmembers are rarely consulted on the problems concerning them. The media pay insufficient attention to the\nproblems and discrimination suffered by ethnic and sexual minorities. The evidence gathered in my\nresearch on ethnic and sexual minorities indicates that media images tend to define these groups within the\nnarrow confines of stereotypical representations. Insufficiently counteracted by alternative portrayals that\nreflect the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural society, the stereotypes legitimize and justify racism, xenophobia\nand homophobia.\nInstead of presenting a wide-ranging reflection of Lithuanian society, the Lithuanian TV and press\ncommunicate dominant ethno-nationalist and heterosexist values of Lithuanian society. A greater range of\nethnic news and characters and of cultural and ethnic viewpoints is lacking. The media reports on ethnic\nand sexual issues are presented in either patronizing or biased way and full of inaccurate information. In a\nsociety concerned with social justice the media need to engage more fully with ethnic, cultural and sexual\ndiversity. More differentiated and accurate portrayals of ethnic and sexual minority communities and their\nlives are necessary.\nPossibilities for Improvement\nThe media play a large part in the formation of positive and negative images and self-images of minorities.\nAccording to B. S. Greenberg, “Researchers have found that communication about minorities is value\nladen and that audiences internalize these values in a number of ways.[28]The mass media shape the\npublic’s conceptions of reality and influence the Lithuanian public’s understanding of ethnic issues and can\ninfluence the direction of public policies related to ethnic minorities. The Lithuanian media help focus our\nattention on specific problems and public policy issues, that is, set the public agenda. Therefore it is\nimportant to challenge and change a dominant regime of representation in the Lithuanian mass media.\nHow can the quality and depth of coverage of ethnic and sexual minority issues be improved? What are the\nways of designing an effective “politics of representation” in the Lithuanian mass media? What\nconclusions can be drawn from the available evidence and finally, what research and policy implications\nensue from the collected information?\nThis section of my paper presents the points of how to develop and execute an effective strategy for\nattaining more and better media coverage for the sexual and ethnic minorities.\nEfforts to improve the media coverage of ethnic and sexual minorities need to be understood in the larger\ncontext of the practices of the mass media and professional codes that guide the standards of Lithuanian\njournalism. Therefore, it is necessary to raise the awareness both of the majority and of the minority\npopulation of all aspects related to racism, xenophobia and homophobia in the Lithuanian mass media. We\nneed to improve information to the general public about ethnic and sexual minorities so as to preempt the\nsocial reproduction of negative stereotypes and myths. This should be done through research, education,\nand publicity campaigns in the media. I propose two different sets of recommendations for ethnic and\nsexual minorities, although some recommendations overlap and can be used for both minorities. In\ndesigning policy strategies for these two minorities, I emphasize the role of different agents and\norganizations essential in implementation of policy recommendations.\nEthnic Minorities\nWith respect to two areas -- research and policy development -- I propose the following measures.\n1.establish a monitoring group in Lithuania\nSince the Lithuanian mass media industry’s awareness of minority issues is fairly limited, a monitoring\ngroup consisting of media scholars and professionals on media and intolerance has to be established. This\ngroup is to examine the media and propose measures against the dissemination of racist and intolerant\nviews in the media. It is to conduct a continued analysis of the portrayals of ethnic minorities in various\nmedia. This research will serve academics, advocates, and the media industry as an assessment tool that\nmeasures progress on the representations of diversity over time. It can benefit the cause of responsible\nmedia representation of ethnicity and can raise awareness among media professionals and the public as to\nwhat they are being shown and what they are not shown. Monitoring mechanisms can be expensive so they\nshould be introduced at most rudimentary level.\n2. develop recommendations and guidelines for the coverage of ethnic minorities\nThis monitoring group will suggest a number of more concrete provisions to be included in the media law\nto combat the expression and dissemination of racist and intolerant opinions in the media. It will also\ndevelop guidelines for the coverage of ethnic minorities addressing\na)individual journalists and educators;\nb)media industry;\nc)governmental and non-governmental bodies such as the Department of National Minorities and\nÉmigrés for the Government of the Republic of Lithuania and the Ethics Commission of Journalists\nand Publishers\nd)and minority organizations.\nSuch guidelines would commit the media to promoting equitable, accurate, and sensitive portrayals of\nminorities.\nI propose preliminary recommendations to all of these areas.\nRecommendations for individual journalists:\n1. seek to frame news stories within the configuration of a diverse society\n2. include ethnic minorities in news stories\n3. deepen public understanding of difference by covering ethnic minorities\n4. depict minority communities and individuals in a balanced and comprehensive manner and in ways\nthat reflect the perspectives and points of view of these communities and individuals\n5. refrain from using biased language or physical descriptions of ethnic minorities\n6. treat individual behavior without linking it to a person’s ethnic origin.\nRecommendations for the Lithuanian Media Industry:\nThe Lithuanian press and TV should reconsider their professional practices:\n1. make treatment of ethnic minorities an issue subject\n2. recognize that the Lithuanian mass media have a civic commitment to oppose racism, xenophobia and\nintolerance\n3. promote multicultural approach to program content and avoid programs that present society in mono-\ncultural and mono-linguistic terms\n4. encourage more ethnic minority journalists participate in the mainstream mass media; they should be\nmade writers and commentators expressing their views publicly\n5. eliminate excuses for xenophobic and racist language and portrayals in the press and on TV.\nRecommendations for the Department of National Minorities and Émigrés for the Government of the\nRepublic of Lithuania and the Ethics Commission of Journalists and Publishers:\n1. establish the active networking of the Department of National Minorities, and the Ethics Commission\nof Journalists and Publishers, minority organizations and NGOs to put minority perspectives on the\nmainstream media’s agenda\n2. formulate more elaborate media guidelines for improved treatment of ethnic minorities\n3. co-ordinate research on the effectiveness of existing legislation on intolerance and hate speech\n4. enforce more vigorously the legislation prohibiting incitement of intolerance and racism in the media\n5. organize, in cooperation with minority organizations and NGOs, seminars and training courses for\nmedia professionals on the subject of tolerance and multiculturalism\nRecommendations for Minority Organizations:\n1. try to keep media attention focused on your problems and issues\n2. target the press and TV:\n? Write letters to publishers of newspapers and TV executives about anti-ethnic media rhetoric\n? counteract the repeated verbal and visual bashings the media inflict on minorities by organizing a\nletter writing campaign to protest anti-minority characterizations\n? in your letters, make specific references to news stories and programs that had appeared in the\npress or on TV\n? encourage the press and telemedia to combat racism and xenophobia through comprehensive\ncoverage of minority issues\n? collect examples of good reporting and coverage and publicize them (issue reports publicizing\npositive achievements and newsworthy articles and broadcasts; award prizes to distinguished\nexamples of media coverage of this area)\n? encourage reporting that is more informed\n3. organize discussions with journalists and meetings with reporters.\nSexual minorities\nIn an intolerant and homophobic atmosphere in Lithuania, outing still puts a stigma on a person. Only a\nsmall part of homosexual population in the country have acknowledged their sexual orientation publicly.\nTherefore in designing policies to improve media representations of sexual minorities, the sexual minority\norganizations should play the leading role. Since information on media content with regard to sexual\nminorities is severely lacking, the Lithuanian sexual minority organizations should monitor periodically the\nLithuanian media for portrayals of gays and lesbians. Secondly, these organizations should express more\noften their dissatisfaction with stereotyped portrayals of sexual minorities as perpetuated by the Lithuanian\nmass media. Actions should be taken against media stereotypes. A successful strategy to counteract\ninvisibility and demeaning stereotypes of gays and lesbians include: 1) the implementation of the policy of\ninclusion that recognizes people of differing sexual and gender identities; 2) the implementation of policies\nthat prohibit the use of homophobic and heterosexist remarks, whether verbal, written or made otherwise.\nMore specific policy measures cover recommendations for sexual minority organizations, the Lithuanian\nJournalist Association, the Commission of Ethics, and Media and Communication Programs at the\nUniversity of Vilnius and Vytautas Magnus University.\nRecommendations for sexual minority advocacy organizations:\na) look to media content to see how sexual minorities are portrayed and how their identities and their\nexperiences are defined for them\nb) organize periodically publicity campaigns to expose media discrimination against sexual minorities\nand to highten the public awareness of media images that are insulting and demeaning to sexual\nminorities;\nc) make your advocacy consistent and continuous. The public should be constantly aware of the problem.\nComplaints about minority stereotypes should be registered with journalists, editors, national\ntelevision station managers, news directors and producers.\nd) organize action on the part of gays and lesbians to protest against their stereotyped portrayals in mass\nmedia. Letter writing and telephone efforts should be a part of advocacy.\ne) challenge individual journalists for their work.\nThe Lithuanian Journalist Association, the Commission of Ethics, Media and Communication\nPrograms should:\n(a) introduce cultural awareness training for journalists and managers of media organizations that\nspecifically addresses gay and lesbian issues;\n(b) develop mass media materials that portray sexual minorities in a constructive and multi-faceted\nmanner and in a wide variety of roles;\n(c) participate in preparation of codes of practice with regard to sexual minority groups;\n(d) adopt measures to eliminate sexual stereotypes in the spoken, written and visual discourse;\n(e) make media professionals aware of the need for balanced portrayals of sexual minority groups;\n(f) include study of the representations of sexual minorities in the mass media in the curricula of\ncommunication schools and media programs;\n(g) enhance professional training, multicultural awareness and continuing on-the-job monitoring of\nprofessional practice.\nConcluding Remarks\nTo redress the current media practices towards ethnic and sexual minorities, we need to develop,\nimplement and enforce the above policies and continually document, through critical research, the\nrelationship between minorities and mass media. To become more socially responsible, the Lithuanian\npress and TV has to construct a sustained strategy to achieve change. Changing the directions of the mass\nmedia requires a serious commitment by all the players, i. e. individual journalists, media industry, the\nCommission of Ethics for Journalists and Publishers, the Department of National Minorities and Émigrés\nand minority organizations.\nTo fight the exclusion and symbolic disadvantage of minorities, we need to promote a politics of\nrecognition that allows space for representational diversity and encourages more complex and sophisticated\nrepresentations of minority communities. There is therefore a strong educational and moral case for\nincluding the neglected or distorted experiences of ethnic and sexual minorities into the media narratives of\na multi-cultural citizenship.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[1] From Vida Beresneviciute, “The Role of Civil Society in Promoting Ethnic and Religious Tolerance in\nLithuania,” in Julianna Matrai, ed., The Role Of Civil Society in Promoting Ethnic and Religious\nTolerance in Central, South Eastern and Eastern Europe (Stiftung Fur Liberale Politic: Harald P.

Poles are the second biggest minority, but less socially\nheterogeneous. Jews, described as a non-territorial minority, present a diaspora. The Roma minority is also\na non-territorial minority, which keeps a prominent cultural distance and is characterized by limited social\nmobility.
