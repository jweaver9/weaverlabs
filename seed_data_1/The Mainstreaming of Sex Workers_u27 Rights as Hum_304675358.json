The international human rights system, birthed in1948 with the UN adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,rests on several fundamental principles: 1) all human beings are born withinherent rights, regardless of their social status; 2) these rights are recog-nized in a series of binding international treaties, customary internationallaw, and guiding principles, and states must respect, protect, and realizethese rights; and 3) monitoring and enforcement occur through diversemechanisms, including the UN system and agencies, regional human rightsbodies, and civil society organizations.2 The sex workers’ rights movementframes3 its cause as a human rights issue in order to connect its fight to thissophisticated international system and to transform sex workers—who areamong the most marginalized and stigmatized communities in the world—into rights bearers in the global discourse.Sex workers’ rights advocates have long argued that the principles andlegal protections enshrined in international human rights treaties and instru-ments apply to sex workers, including freedom from discrimination and vio-lence and the rights to association, movement, work, health, privacy, and1 See, e.g., WORLD HEALTH ORG. ET AL., IMPLEMENTING COMPREHENSIVE HIV/STIPROGRAMMES WITH SEX WORKERS xiv (2013). The Global Network of Sex Work Projects(NSWP), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United NationsDevelopment Program (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Bank,and the World Health Organization (WHO) define sex workers as “[f]emale, male andtransgender adults and young people (over 18 years of age) who receive money or goodsin exchange for sexual services, either regularly or occasionally.” WORLD HEALTH ORG.ET AL., IMPLEMENTING COMPREHENSIVE HIV/STI PROGRAMMES WITH SEX WORKERS xxi(2013) [hereinafter WHO, IMPLEMENTING COMPREHENSIVE HIV/STI PROGRAMMES] ,https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/90000/9789241506182_eng.pdf [https://perma.cc/B8JD-W9ZV].2 See What are human rights?, U.N.

Ben-ford & David A. Snow, Framing Processes and Social Movements: An Overview andAssessment, 26 ANN. REV. SOC. 611, 613 (2000). By “framing” an issue, social move-ments attempt to construct new and shared meanings regarding social problems: theydiagnose the causes of a problem, identify the actors responsible for the problem andthose tasked with correcting it, and imagine alternative, emancipatory futures. The newlyarticulated interpretive frames of social movements are often contentious because theychallenge commonly accepted understandings of an issue.

How have influen-tial international human rights bodies officially responded to this framing,and what are the strengths and limitations of these responses? And, finally,how have sex workers’ rights advocates attempted to use mainstream humanrights recognition to secure political and legal gains for sex workers on theground?Part I will trace the history of the sex workers’ rights movement’s con-struction of sex workers’ rights as human rights and explore the power of thearguments buttressing this framing. The 1960s and 70s marked the nascenceof the sex workers’ rights movement. The activism of transgender sex work-ers involved in the 1960s queer liberation movement in the United Statesprovides some of the earliest examples of sex worker organizing.5 By 1973,Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics (COYOTE), the first formal sex workers’rights organization in the United States, was founded.6 The legendary 1975occupation of the Church of Saint-Nizier by striking French sex workers inLyon, France, helped spark the movement in Europe.7 Though these inspir-ing examples of early sex worker organizing—although at times referencingthe concept of “human rights”—did not forcefully lay claim to the legalprotections of the international human rights system as a central part of theirpolitical activism, this changed in the 1980s and 90s as sex worker organiz-ing began to globalize. In 1985, the International Committee for Prostitutes’Rights adopted the World Charter for Prostitutes’ Rights,8 marking the firsttime sex workers’ rights organizers formally attached a human rights frameto their rhetoric of resistance. Part I will also explore how the effects of theearly HIV/AIDS crisis on sex worker communities helped strengthen the sexworkers’ rights movement’s embrace of a human rights framework. It willthen highlight how the championing of a human rights frame—necessarilyan international endeavor—grew stronger as the movement morphed fromfocusing largely on Global North women in the sex trades to including andelevating the voices and experiences of diverse Global South sex workers.Part II will argue that sex workers’ rights advocates engage in importantfeminist intellectual labor by linking a human rights frame to their struggles4 See GLOB.

In a slewof official documents, numerous global human rights mechanisms such asUN treaty bodies and Special Procedures, regional bodies like the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, UN-affiliated agencies like theJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and leadingnonprofit organizations like Amnesty International (“Amnesty”) have main-streamed the idea that human rights protections apply to sex workers. Thesehuman rights bodies have paid particular attention to issues concerning vio-lence against sex workers, violations of sex workers’ right to health, abusiveactivities claiming to fight the “traffic in women,” and the legal status of sexwork. While the Article lauds this institutionalization of sex workers’ rightsas human rights, Part III will urge international bodies to do more to grapplewith the full landscape of sex workers’ human rights claims, encouraging amore robust articulation of the human rights distinction between fulldecriminalization and partial criminalization of sex work and a deeper en-gagement with sex workers’ labor rights claims.Part IV will briefly examine how sex workers’ rights advocates haveused human rights bodies’ institutionalization of sex workers’ rights ashuman rights to try to effect legal and political change in sex workers’ lives.A series of case studies will illuminate this on-the-ground advocacy, includ-ing examples of lobbying by sex workers’ rights advocates of governmentofficials for implementation of international bodies’ rights-affirming recom-mendations. The Article will conclude by arguing that the emerging consen-sus among human rights bodies that sex workers’ rights are human rights is,encouragingly, not in line with the longstanding and damaging anti-prostitu-tion argument that sex work is itself a human rights violation. Among influ-ential human rights institutions, global sex workers’ rights advocates arelargely winning the longstanding feminist debates against anti-prostitutionactivists. The mainstream human rights position, now embraced by the likesof Amnesty, Human Rights Watch (HRW), UNAIDS, and WHO, locatesviolence not in sex work itself but in the human rights abuses emanatingfrom its criminalization. The human rights frame that sex worker advocateshave championed for decades focuses the conversation where it belongs: noton theoretical arguments about the meaning of sex work but on the evi-dence-based realities of the streets, bars, brothels, clubs, massage parlors,\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\H\\HLG\\43-1\\HLG103.txt unknown Seq: 5 29-JAN-20 12:482020] The Mainstreaming of Sex Workers’ Rights as Human Rights 95and truck-stops where sex workers suffer human rights abuses because of theharmful and unrelenting hand of the carceral state.I. HISTORY OF THE SEX WORKERS’ RIGHTS MOVEMENT’S FRAMINGOF SEX WORKERS’ RIGHTS AS HUMAN RIGHTSA. 1960s and 70s: The Emergence of Collective Actionfor Sex Workers’ RightsThe 1960s United States political landscape was blanketed in thrivingmovements for social change, including demands for civil rights for commu-nities of color, black power, women’s liberation, and a cultural revolutionthat challenged mainstream gender and sexual expression. Queer liberationemerged as part of this titanic shift in the political, cultural, and social at-mosphere.9 It is difficult to imagine the birth of the sex workers’ rightsmovement without the example of resistance provided by these move-ments.10 The “fiery and forgotten” beginnings of the sex workers’ rightsmovement in the United States can be traced back to the birth of the queerliberation movement. In response to rampant police abuse against the queercommunity, transgender women who engaged in sex work participated inuprisings such as the 1966 Compton’s Cafeteria Strike in San Francisco andthe 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City.11The riot at Compton’s Cafeteria, and the role that sex workers played inthe uprising, is a relatively recent discovery in queer liberation history.12 Therescue of this episode from erasure by a whitewashed version of queer pro-test history helps center the role of members of the queer community whohave longed suffered disproportionately at the hands of police violence, in-cluding people of color, street-based youth, transgender people, and sexworkers.13 Compton’s Cafeteria was located in San Francisco’s Tenderloindistrict, which was home to many trans women who engaged in sex work.They faced severe abuse from police who sexually assaulted them, profiledand arrested them for prostitution, placed them in male jail cells, and shavedtheir heads in prison, among other indignities.14 Things came to a head inAugust of 1966, when sex workers were among the queer patrons atCompton’s Cafeteria who resisted arrest when the police attempted to clear9 See SUSAN STRYKER, TRANSGENDER HISTORY, 63–64, 82, 98–99 (2008).10 See MELISSA GIRA GRANT, PLAYING THE WHORE: THE WORK OF SEX WORK 116(2014).11 CHATEAUVERT, supra note 5, at 8–9.12 See id. at 8–9.13 Che Gossett, Reina Gossett & AJ Lewis, Reclaiming Our Lineage: OrganizedQueer, Gender-Nonconforming, and Transgender Resistance to Police Violence,SCHOLAR & FEMINIST ONLINE (2012), http://sfonline.barnard.edu/a-new-queer-agenda/reclaiming-our-lineage-organized-queer-gender-nonconforming-and-transgender-resistance-to-police-violence/ [https://perma.cc/ERH3-CJL5].14 STRYKER, supra note 9, at 67.\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\H\\HLG\\43-1\\HLG103.txt unknown Seq: 6 29-JAN-20 12:4896 Harvard Journal of Law & Gender [Vol. 43them from the establishment.15 The patrons smashed windows and plates,overturned tables, and defaced police cars in protest.16Three years later in 1969, sex workers also played a role in the famousuprising at the Stonewall Inn in New York City, where patrons who hadfaced unrelenting and violent harassment from police officers resisted arrestduring a routine raid of the establishment.17 In 1970, Sylvia Rivera and Mar-sha P. Johnson, famous participants of the Stonewall Rebellion and transwomen of color who engaged in sex work, founded Street Transvestite Ac-tion Revolutionaries (STAR), an activist organization that provided shelterfor street-based queer youth and transgender people, including sex work-ers.18 Rivera and Johnson engaged in sex work as a survival strategy but alsoas movement work: earnings from sex work helped fund some of their un-paid movement-building activities. Despite marginalization by the largerqueer community in the early movement, including by radical lesbians whoderided trans women as “female impersonators,” Rivera spoke out force-fully on behalf of trans women and street-based youth who faced criminal-ization for engaging in sex work activities that were often the only povertyalleviation options available to them because of rampant discrimination.19These examples of the role that sex workers played in the early queer libera-tion movement laid the groundwork for what would become the prostitutes’rights movement in the United States that began in the 1970s.20The year 1973 marked the founding of COYOTE, the first organizationin the United States dedicated primarily to sex workers’ rights.21 Founded byformer sex worker Margo St. James, COYOTE was one of the earliest exam-ples of sex workers formally mobilizing as political agents. With a focus onstate and police violence against sex workers, they sought to change bothlaws and social mores around sex work.22 COYOTE’s political demands in-cluded the decriminalization of sex work; they also provided legal, medical,and financial assistance to sex workers.23 The COYOTE advocacy newslet-ter, which ran from 1974 to 1979, highlighted both national and internationalevents occurring in the nascent sex workers’ rights movement.2415 Riot at Compton’s Cafeteria, GLOB.

Like the previous decade’suprisings at Compton’s Cafeteria and Stonewall, the French sex workers’strike was largely driven by grievances regarding police violence.25 Inspiredby the Lyon political action, French sex workers in Grenoble, Marseille,Montpellier, and Paris joined the protest and occupied churches in their cit-ies.26 The French sex workers’ strike presented sex workers as political actorscapable of collectively organizing on a scale that could capture sustainedinternational media attention.27Media documentation of the striking French sex workers quoted someof the participants describing their political claims as “human rights con-cerns,”28 and Margo St. James referred to sex workers’ “demands for humanrights” in reflecting on COYOTE’s early activism.29 However, despite theseexamples of the language of “human rights” appearing in early sex workeradvocacy, there is little evidence to suggest that the discourse of the interna-tional human rights regime played a significant role in budding sex workeractivism of the 1960s and 70s. This changed in the 1980s when the sexworkers’ rights movement began to globalize and confronted the devastatingHIV/AIDS crisis, adopting for the first time an explicit human rightsframing.B. 1980s and 90s: A Globalizing Movement Frames Sex Workers’ Rightsas Human Rights in the Shadow of the HIV/AIDS CrisisCOYOTE and the French sex workers’ uprising inspired the beginningsof an internationalizing movement for sex workers’ rights: new sex workers’rights organizations were formed throughout the 1980s in countries in theGlobal North, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UnitedKingdom, and the United States, and several in the Global South, includingEcuador, Thailand, and Uruguay.30 It is not surprising that as the movementbegan to internationalize in the 1980s, sex workers’ rights advocates wouldalso begin to link their discourse of resistance to an international system ofrights and state accountability that could speak to sex workers’ needsthroughout the world: a newly globalizing movement required a global lan-guage of rights. By championing a human rights framework, the movementwould ensure that the international community could no longer ignoreabuses against sex workers.25 See MGBAKO, supra note 7, at 185; Aroney, supra note 7, at 2, 5.26 See ARONEY, supra note 7, at 6.27 Id. at 10, 12.28 Id. at 12.29 PHETERSON, supra note 8, at xix.30 MGBAKO, supra note 7, at 185.\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\H\\HLG\\43-1\\HLG103.txt unknown Seq: 8 29-JAN-20 12:4898 Harvard Journal of Law & Gender [Vol. 43In 1985, United States, Canadian, and European representatives fromsex workers’ rights organizations that had formed in the wake of the move-ment birthed in the mid-1970s created the International Committee for Pros-titutes’ Rights (ICPR), which met in Amsterdam the same year for aninternational gathering referred to as the First World Whores’ Congress.31During the First World Whores’ Congress, the ICPR drafted the World Char-ter for Prostitutes’ Rights (“Charter”), which marked the first time the sexworkers’ rights movement formally applied a human rights frame to its liber-ation project.32 The Charter, which the ICPR formally presented to the presson February 15, 1985, demanded that sex workers be guaranteed “all humanrights and civil liberties, including the freedom of speech, travel, immigra-tion, work, marriage, and motherhood and the right to unemployment insur-ance, health insurance and housing.”33The human rights-based approach the ICPR established during the FirstWorld Whores Congress continued during the Second World Whores Con-gress, which took place at the European Parliament in Brussels in 1986. TheICPR held special sessions on human rights to highlight abuses against sexworkers in specific countries.34 Although one sex worker from Thailand gavetestimony during the sessions, the vast majority of the sessions featured tes-timony from sex workers in the Global North, particularly Europe.35 Thesessions resulted in a Statement on Prostitution and Human Rights (“State-ment”) issued by the ICPR in October, 1986.36 The Statement marks the firsttime the sex workers’ rights movement appealed to a human rights treaty—inthis case, the European Convention on Human Rights—as a basis for itsrights claims. The Statement was a more ambitious document than the 1985Charter. It included a powerful argument for the application of the interna-tional human rights system to sex workers in Europe and throughout theworld:The International Committee for Prostitutes’ Rights (ICPR) de-mands that prostitutes, ex-prostitutes and all women regardless oftheir work, color, class, sexuality, history of abuse or marital statusbe granted the same human rights as every other citizen. At pre-sent, prostitutes are officially and/or unofficially denied rights bothby states within the Council of Europe and by States outside of it.No state in the world is held accountable by any international body31 PHETERSON, supra note 8, at 33–39.32 Penelope Saunders, Fifteen Years after the World Charter for Prostitutes’ Rights,CARNEGIE COUNCIL FOR ETHICS IN INT’L AFFAIRS (Aug. 6, 2000), https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/archive/dialogue/2_03/articles/629 [https://perma.cc/7DVC-LHVL].33 PHETERSON, supra note 8, at 40.

To the contrary, denial of human rights toprostitutes is publicly justified as a protection of women, publicorder, health, morality and the reputation of dominant persons ornations. Those arguments deny prostitutes the status of ordinarypersons. . . . Criminalization or state regulation of prostitution doesnot protect anyone, least of all prostitutes. Prostitutes are systemat-ically robbed of liberty, security, fair administration of justice, re-spect for private and family life, freedom of expression andfreedom of association. In addition, they suffer from inhuman anddegrading treatment and punishment and from discrimination inemployment and housing. Prostitutes are effectively excludedfrom the Human Rights Convention.37By framing its claims as a human rights issue, the sex workers’ rights move-ment was creating new social meanings regarding sex work. Through theirStatement, advocates diagnosed the issue of “prostitution” as the problem ofa marginalized community being denied their human rights—not as one ofmorality or public order. They described “prostitutes” as “ordinary citizens”and the same as “all women,” not as deviant others.38 They laid the responsi-bility of human rights violations against sex workers on States, not on sexwork itself. And they proposed a new remedy for these violations centeredon the monitoring and enforcement power of the international human rightssystem, not on further criminalization of sex work and sex workers.39The nascent globalization of the sex workers’ rights movement helpedadvocates frame the issue in the global language of human rights, and so didthe globalization of the devastating HIV/AIDS crisis that took hold in the1980s. At the First World Whores’ Congress in 1985, there was little mentionof HIV/AIDS. But by the Second World Whores’ Congress in 1986, sexworkers could no longer ignore the epidemic taking root in their communi-ties and throughout the world.40  Transcripts of testimony from the SecondWorld Whores’ Congress committee sessions on health show that sex work-ers regularly raised the issue of AIDS.41 The committee sessions ended withthe ICPR’s release of the Statement on Prostitution and Health, which in-cluded a dedicated section on human rights that, among other demands, spe-cifically called for sex workers to have access to free and voluntarycounseling and testing for HIV/AIDS.42 A human rights approach to sexwork and HIV/AIDS recognizes that HIV/AIDS in sex work communitieswill never be resolved if the human rights violations that render sex workers37 Id.38 In the Statement, the ICPR also acknowledges that men also engage in sex work.Id.39 Id.40 Id. at 35.41 For a transcript of testimony from the health sessions of the Second World Whores’Congress, see id. at 109–31.42 Id. at 141–143.\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\H\\HLG\\43-1\\HLG103.txt unknown Seq: 10 29-JAN-20 12:48100 Harvard Journal of Law & Gender [Vol. 43disproportionately vulnerable to HIV—healthcare discrimination, sexualabuse from police officers and criminals posing as clients, lack of access tojustice, and condom confiscation—are not addressed.The HIV/AIDS crisis led to a shift in early sex worker organizing in theUnited States from a feminist and civil rights orientation to one with anincreased focus on human rights and harm reduction.43 By 1985, advocatesin the United States had organized sex worker-run direct services that dis-tributed condoms and conducted HIV/AIDS education in sex work commu-nities. By doing so, they embraced the human rights principle that allpeople—no matter the moral station assigned to them nor the type of workor sex they engage in—are worthy of life-saving access to healthcare.44 Thishuman rights framing would eventually expand the scope of the movementin the United States: “The sex workers’ movement could no longer focusonly on women; a human rights-based movement needed everyone in the sextrades.”45 Consequently, beginning in the late 1990s, the movement diversi-fied, particularly by reaching out to male, queer, and transgender sexworkers.46The HIV/AIDS crisis, as well as its disproportionate impact on theglobal sex workers’ rights community, was one of the central factors in thecontinuing internationalization of the early sex workers’ rights movement.47The first decade of the globalizing sex workers’ rights movement was domi-nated by sex workers from the Global North at international gatherings likethe World Whores’ Congresses, with minimal representation from sex work-ers in the Global South. This began to change in the 1990s, as sex workersfrom the Global South were first able to access donor funding to participatein international gatherings and global alliances focusing on HIV/AIDS.48One of those Global South organizations was the Sex Workers Educationand Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT), which was founded in South Africa in1994 as one of the first sex workers’ rights organizations in Africa.

A SWEATadvocate noted: “As the program developed, we recognized that the [distri-bution] of condoms was just merely an access point to sex workers—theywould then begin to relate their stories of human rights abuse, the lack offacilities, certainly stigma, and when they were confronted with abuse fromhealth care professionals. We then decided as a SWEAT team that this pro-gram would begin to feed the human rights approach.”49 This approachwould eventually involve rights-based legal reform and media advocacy.50In 1992, the Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP), the lead-ing international umbrella organization of sex workers’ rights organizationsin both the Global North and Global South, was launched at the InternationalAIDS Conference in Amsterdam.51 NSWP played a pivotal role in the con-tinued globalization of the movement in the wake of the early HIV/AIDScrisis and in advocating for the human rights concerns of both female andmale (cisgender and transgender) sex workers.52 NSWP became a highly ac-tive and visible presence in the global response to HIV/AIDS, and the organ-ization played a crucial role in changing the vocabulary used in internationalHIV/AIDS forums to discuss sex work, encouraging international actors totransition from use of the terms  “prostitution”/“prostitutes” to “sex work”/“sex workers” as an essential step in the reframing of sex workers as rights-bearing human beings and laborers rather than stigmatized others.53C. 1990s – Present: A Diverse, Fully Globalized Movement EmbracesSex Workers’ Rights as Human RightsBy the 1990s, the globalizing sex workers’ rights movement began tomore fully reflect the diversity of sex trades with the founding of influentialsex workers’ rights organizations in the Global South.

In 1994, sex workers in Asia founded the regional organization theAsia Pacific Network of Sex Workers (APNSW) with participation from sexworkers’ rights groups in India, Malaysia, and Thailand who had embraced ahealth and human rights approach in their work with sex workers.56 APNSWcurrently has members representing twenty countries in the region and listsprotecting sex workers’ human rights as one of the central tenets of its mis-sion statement.57 In 1997, sex workers in Latin America and the Caribbeanformed the regional organization Red de Mujeres Trabajadores Sexuales deLatinoame´rica y el Caribe (RedTraSex), which now consists of representa-tives from fifteen countries.58 Their organizational statute lists respect for sexworkers’ human rights as an important aspect of their vision.59 The year 2002marked the first time that sex workers throughout the world celebrated Inter-national Sex Workers’ Rights Day, which seeks to shine a light on humanrights abuses against sex workers. This annual event was inspired by theactivism of 25,000 sex workers in India from the sex worker collective Dur-bar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC), who had organized a festivalthe previous year and called on the global sex work community to join themin annually marking Sex Workers’ Rights Day.60 In 2009, sex workerslaunched the African Sex Workers Alliance (ASWA) when representativesfrom ten African countries gathered at a conference in Johannesburg, SouthAfrica, with the stated goal of advocating for sex workers’ human rights inAfrica (in the years since, membership has ballooned to represent thirty-55 See History, GLOB.

The Declaration is an ambitious document that outlines the panoplyof rights to which sex workers in Europe are entitled under international lawbased on treaties ratified by European countries. The Declaration was also,importantly, one of the first times sex worker advocates stated in an officialcapacity what they hoped to gain by explicitly appealing to a human rightsframing in their advocacy: empowerment of sex workers by basing theirrights claims on the authoritative weight of the international justice system,clearly articulated benchmarks for advocates to measure progress and futureorganizing, the vision of an emancipatory future in which policies and prac-tices related to sex work are rooted in the enhancement of sex workers’rights, and the long-term goal of swaying public opinion to fully embrace theidea that healthy societies depend on the realization of all peoples’ humanrights.63In 2012 and 2013, two global events—the Sex Workers Freedom Festi-val and the Consensus Statement on Sex Work, Human Rights, and the Law(“Consensus Statement”)—organized sex workers from both the GlobalNorth and South in a unified embrace of the human rights frame. Sex work-ers’ rights advocates organized the 2012 Sex Workers Freedom Festival be-cause sex workers could not participate in the 2012 International AIDSConference in Washington, D.C. due to discriminatory travel restrictions thatbar entry to the United States for people who have engaged in sex work.64 Inresponse, the Sex Workers Freedom Festival—the largest and most diversegathering of sex workers’ rights advocates ever recorded, with hundreds ofactivists representing forty-three countries participating—was “both a pro-test against sex workers’ exclusion and a demand for respect of their humanrights.”65 The festival ran parallel to the International AIDS Conference andcentered on the application of universal human rights to sex workers.66 Dur-61 The African Sex Workers Alliance (ASWA) is the Pan African alliance of sexworker led organisations, AFRICAN SEX WORKERS ALL., https://aswaalliance.org/about/story/ [https://perma.cc/89UT-RSGJ] (last visited July 17, 2019).62 ‘We want rights, not rescue,’ INDEP.

THE SEX WORKERS’ RIGHTS MOVEMENT’S HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMING ISA REJECTION OF WHOREPHOBIA, THE POLITICS OF RESCUE,AND CARCERAL FEMINISMA. Rejecting Whorephobia and Whore StigmaPeople engaged in sex work have long been dehumanized as deviant“others” in cultures throughout the world.79 The sex workers’ rights move-ment’s human rights framing affirms sex workers’ humanity and repudiatesthe dehumanization sex workers experience. One of the main vehicles of sexworker dehumanization is “whorephobia,” defined as the “social fear andhatred of sex workers.”80 Whorephobia deeply stigmatizes people in the sexwork industry, and as historian Melinda Chateauvert contends, it succeeds at“reducing ‘hookers,’ ‘prostitutes,’ ‘whores,’ and ‘hustlers’ to people whoaren’t worthy of concern and, indeed, people who should be chased out ofneighborhoods or locked up in prison.”81 Sex workers suffer higher rates ofmurder than the general population, and sex workers’ rights activists havemaintained that in its most extreme form, “whorephobia kills.”82A precursor to the concept of whorephobia is the theory of “whorestigma,” a term coined by scholar Gail Pheterson in the 1990s.83 Phetersondefined whore stigma as the “social and legal branding of women who aresuspected of being or acting like prostitutes.”84 She argued that althoughwhore stigma specifically targets sex workers, it also implicitly seeks to reg-ulate the behavior of all women whose autonomy flouts accepted sexual andsocial behavior.

And so long as that is, men will feel they can leave whoresfor dead with impunity.”86 Anti-prostitution activists’ efforts to abolish sexwork—even when they characterize sex workers not as transgressors but asembodiments of a “narrative of female victimhood”—only serve tostrengthen whore stigma.87 State actors, including police, healthcare workers,and the justice system, have successfully institutionalized whore stigma,which is a leading obstacle to the realization of sex workers’ rights.88The movement’s framing of sex workers’ rights as human rights is adirect rejection of the dehumanizing mandates of whorephobia and whorestigma. When sex workers’ rights advocates fight against the abuses sexworkers experience at the hands of societies that dehumanize them, they areinsisting that the “whore” is, in fact, a rights-bearing human being. Theradical concept at the center of the modern human rights movement birthedin 1948 with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the idea thathuman rights are universal—regardless of one’s social station.89 When sexworkers embrace a human rights frame, they are necessarily advocating foruniversality. Whorephobia mandates that the “whore” is deserving only ofstigma, disregard, disdain, and not rights. A human rights frame mandatesthat sex workers are deserving only of universally applied rights—like allpeople everywhere—by simple virtue of their humanity.B. Rejecting RescueSex workers have long been the focus of a politics of rescue that at-tempts to negate the agency of people in the sex trades. The movement’shuman rights framing rejects the rescue narrative that insists that sex work-ers are passive victims without agency who need to be saved.

In the late nine-teenth century and early twentieth century, a notorious sex panic in theUnited States and United Kingdom over so-called “white slavery”—basedon racist and unfounded fears that society needed to save white women frombeing forced into prostitution by foreign-born men and men of color—led toanti-prostitution legislation such as the Mann Act in the United States thatwas in part used as a legal basis to prosecute consensual interracial sexualrelationships.91 Decades later, radical feminists of the 1960s and 1970s be-lieved sex work was the epitome of patriarchal control of female sexualityand claimed that sex workers needed to understand their “oppression” andbe rescued from their “false consciousness” in order to join the feministrevolution.92 In 1989, Gail Pheterson noted that the early sex workers’ rightsmovement was rightly challenging a long history of societal attempts at themoral rescue of sex workers: “Be it the doctors and politicians who foughtfor state regulation of prostitution or the feminists and religious crusaderswho fought for the abolition of prostitution, activists have historicallyworked to protect, supervise, reform and/or condemn those who sell sex.Never have prostitutes been legitimized as spokespersons or self-determin-ing agents.”93 Despite the devastating worldwide HIV/AIDS crisis takinghold in the 1980s and 1990s, leading anti-prostitution scholar KathleenBarry argued in 1995 that HIV prevention efforts in sex work communitiesshould not include the distribution of condoms to sex workers. “AIDS pre-vention,” she maintained, “should be oriented toward getting women out ofprostitution.”94 Sex worker activist Priscilla Alexander responded forcefully:“Barry’s recommendation that we cease promoting condoms and instead res-cue women from prostitution is . . . genocidal for the women who continueto work as prostitutes.”95Contemporary anti-prostitution efforts also embrace the politics of res-cue. One common form of rescue is the proliferation of “rehabilitation” pro-grams targeting sex workers. These programs attempt to “save” sex workersby training them in alternative livelihood programs focused on “respecta-90 Chi Mgbako, Why the Women’s Rights Movement Must Listen to Sex Workers,HUFFPOST (Aug. 1, 2012), https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sex-workers_b_1561428[https://perma.cc/RQ7V-36BS].91 See JUNO MAC & MOLLY SMITH, REVOLTING PROSTITUTES: THE FIGHT FOR SEXWORKERS’ RIGHTS 74 (2018); see also ELIZABETH BERNSTEIN, BROKERED SUBJECTS: SEX,TRAFFICKING, AND THE POLITICS OF FREEDOM 9, 191 n.26 (2019).92 CHATEAUVERT, supra note 5, at 12–13.93 PHETERSON, supra note 8, at 3–4.94 Priscilla Alexander, Feminism, Sex Workers, and Human Rights, in WHORES ANDOTHER FEMINISTS 83, 90 (Jill Nagle ed., 2010) (citing KATHLEEN BARRY, THE PROSTITU-TION OF SEXUALITY 248 (1979)).95 Id. at 90.\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\H\\HLG\\43-1\\HLG103.txt unknown Seq: 18 29-JAN-20 12:48108 Harvard Journal of Law & Gender [Vol. 43ble” gendered work.96 Sex workers in these programs are forced to quit sexwork, even though the alternative activities in which they are trained areoften not economically viable and further impoverish them in the process.There is no evidence that rehabilitation programs aimed at “reforming” peo-ple in the sex work industry economically empower sex workers, reduceviolence against them, or decrease their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Instead,rehabilitation programs only further stigma against sex workers and divertresources from efforts that could improve their working conditions.97Perhaps no contemporary rescue narrative related to sex work has beenas powerful—or as harmful—as the discourse surrounding the “traffic inwomen.” In 2007, cultural critic Laura Agustı´n first coined the term “rescueindustry” to describe the grouping of social actors posing as the benevolentsaviors of often migrating women whom they claim are the victims of sextrafficking.98 In a 2018 ethnography of global anti-trafficking discourse,sociologist Elizabeth Bernstein demonstrates how the contemporary rescueindustry is comprised of government institutions, secular/carceral feminists,evangelical Christians, and other private and nonprofit organizations whohave committed themselves to ending so-called sex trafficking.99 The effortsof this modern anti-trafficking rescue industry have led to abuses against sexworkers, including in the form of brothel raids and administrative detentionof sex workers under the guise of rescue and rehabilitation.100The sex workers’ rights movement’s embrace of a human rights frame isa repudiation of the politics of “rescue” and “rehabilitation” that deny sexworkers agency. When sex workers declare “rights, not rescue,” when theyorganize for change in hundreds of groups throughout the world, they areasserting themselves as agents capable of speaking out about the materialconditions of their work and their lives. Human rights activism must bebased on the notion that in order to fully and adequately address the humanrights abuses people face, we must center the voices of directly affectedcommunities who are best equipped to both identify and diagnose thesources of their marginalization and fashion viable solutions.101 To centerthese voices, a human rights-based approach demands that we believe in theagency of marginalized communities, their ability to make choices for them-96 Governments fund these programs through national gender budgets. The programsoften focus on skills-training classes on sewing, jewelry making, gardening, cooking,embroidery, and candle making, and sometimes include religious doctrine.

But sexworkers can and do exhibit human agency—they make rational decisionseven amid the limited choices of the harsh economic order.”103 The politicsof rescue seeks to convince us that marginalized people like sex workers areincapable of understanding or articulating the forces that oppress them, andthus benevolent saviors must speak on their behalf. This reasoning is false inthe face of a decades-old, organized, culturally diverse, and globalized sexworker-led movement for human rights.C. Rejecting Carceral FeminismThe term “carceral feminism” was first coined in 2007 by ElizabethBernstein as the critique of a feminist approach to contemporary social is-sues that relies on the carceral state—police, prisons, and prosecutions—asthe primary method for realizing feminist goals.104 Anti-prostitution activistspractice carceral feminism: they seek to solve the “problem” of sex work bycalling for entrenched police power in the form of, for example, the contin-ued criminalization of sex workers’ clients (a position that sex workers haveargued puts them in precarious situations).105 The sex workers’ rights move-ment rejects carceral feminism and maintains that criminalization is thecause of human rights abuses against sex workers.106 Thus, the carceral statewill not be the pathway to sex workers’ liberation.Scholars have also criticized gender-based human rights movementsthat rely largely on a carceral approach to human rights.107 In this regard, thesex workers’ rights movement notably stands apart from other gender-basedhuman rights movements because of the anti-carceral framing of its humanrights claims.

Violence against Sex WorkersInternational human rights bodies characterize various forms of vio-lence against sex workers as human rights violations and call on govern-ments to prevent and address these abuses. They have paid particularattention to violence sex workers experience at the hands of police officersand medical practitioners, sex workers’ lack of access to justice, and theforced administrative detention of sex workers. Human rights bodies havealso highlighted, although to a lesser extent, the intersectional violence suf-fered by transgender sex workers and migrant sex workers.Human rights bodies have expressed concern over evidence of rampantpolice abuse of sex workers. For example, in 2010, the United States under-went a UPR by the UN Human Rights Council, during which it received anofficial recommendation to address violence against sex workers.117 This rec-ommendation was prompted by a report submitted to the UPR by sex work-ers’ rights organizations in the United States, including Best Practices PolicyProject and Desiree Alliance, which documented a disturbing pattern of po-lice abuse of sex workers, including physical and sexual assaults.118 “U.S.sex workers’ greatest fear,” the report noted, “is abuse by the police andother state agents.”119 In 2016 and 2017, the Committee on the Eliminationof Discrimination against Women (“CEDAW Committee”), which monitorsstate adherence to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Dis-crimination against Women, called on the governments of Kyrgyzstan andNigeria to protect sex workers from widespread police abuse.120 The NigeriaSex Workers Association had submitted a report to the CEDAW Committeeduring Nigeria’s review that included gruesome photographic evidence ofthis abuse.121 In 2016, the Human Rights Committee, which monitors gov-ernment implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights, reviewed Ghana’s human rights record and likewise expressed con-117 U.N.

When we report violence to the authorities, we are faced with prejudiceand further violated by the same law enforcers who should protect us.”123 Inresponse, the CEDAW Committee called on the Kenyan government to en-sure sex workers have access to justice when they are the victims of violentcrime—including when the perpetrators are law enforcement officers.124 TheCommittee against Torture (“CAT Committee”), which monitors govern-ment implementation of the Convention against Torture, highlighted reportsof police abuse of sex workers in its 2017 review of Namibia and called onthe State Party to “take all effective legislative, administrative, judicial andother measures to prevent persons selling sexual services from being sub-jected to torture and ill-treatment.”125 This finding and call to action wassparked by a report submitted to the CAT Committee by Namibian sexworkers’ rights organizations and allies, such as Voices of Hope Trust andRights not Rescue Trust.126The CAT Committee and the Special Rapporteur on Torture have af-firmed that abuse of sex workers by health officials can rise to the level ofdegrading treatment in contravention of the Convention against Torture. Forexample, in 2010, the CAT Committee characterized the “humiliating cir-cumstances” of Austria’s forced medical testing of sex workers as degradingtreatment.127 The Sex-Worker Forum of Vienna, Austria, submitted a reportto the CAT Committee documenting forced STI blood tests and mandatoryvaginal exams of sex workers that took place under the gaze of male policeofficers.128 (The CEDAW Committee has argued that forced medical check-ups of sex workers are also a violation of their rights to privacy and move-122 Human Rights Committee, Concluding observations on the initial reports ofGhana, at 13, U.N.

In its 2015 review of China, the CAT Committeeraised concerns over abuses related to the secret administrative detentionwithout due process of people suspected of engaging in sex work, a primafacie breach of the Convention against Torture.132 Similarly, in 2017, theCAT Committee called on the government of Rwanda to abolish its systemof forced administrative detention of people suspected of sex work for thepurpose of “rehabilitation,” arguing that it increases detainees’ vulnerabilityto abuse.133 In a country condition report on India, the Special Rapporteur onViolence against Women decried the forced detention and rehabilitation ofsex workers, as well as violence sex workers endure at the hands of “clients,family members, the community and State authorities.”134Human rights bodies have also highlighted the violence faced by trans-gender sex workers and migrant sex workers. The Inter-American Commis-sion on Human Rights (“Inter-American Commission”) has shown greatsensitivity to the plight of transgender sex workers and in 2015 issued acomprehensive report that documented the severe violence transgender sexworkers experience in the form of police abuse, arbitrary detention, commu-nity violence, and murder.135 From 2012 to 2017, the Inter-American Com-mission also issued a string of country condition reports that includedevidence of rights violations against transgender sex workers in Jamaica,129 CEDAW, Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Dis-crimination against Women Tunisia, at 8, U.N.

Abuses of Sex Workers’ Right to HealthHuman rights bodies have also focused welcome attention on violationsof sex workers’ right to health. In 1999, the CEDAW Committee issued Gen-eral Recommendation No. 24, which states that “special attention should begiven to the health needs and rights of women belonging to vulnerable anddisadvantaged groups,” including “women in prostitution.”140 The Commit-tee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  (“CESCR Committee”)monitors government implementation of the International Covenant on Eco-nomic, Social and Cultural Rights, and in its General Comment No. 22, callson States Parties to “take measures to fully protect persons working in thesex industry,” including by ensuring “access to the full range of sexual andreproductive healthcare services.”141136 INTER-AM.

In its 2013 review of Hungary, for example,the CEDAW Committee voiced concern over sex workers’ labor environ-ments, recommending that the State “[a]dopt measures aimed at preventingdiscrimination against sex workers and ensure that legislation on their rightto safe working conditions is guaranteed at national and local levels.”152 Inits 2018 review of El Salvador, the Human Rights Committee lists sex work-ers as among a group of marginalized communities that face discriminationin access to education, employment, health, and housing.153C.

This is why increased scrutiny by human rights bodies of abusive anti-trafficking law and policies has been a welcome development. In 2000, forexample, the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women stated that“[a]ny remedy or strategy proposed to combat trafficking and provide assis-tance to victims of trafficking must be assessed in terms of whether and howit promotes and provides protection for the human rights of women.”157 TheSpecial Rapporteur on Violence against Women also criticized anti-traffick-ing immigration policies that further restrict legal border crossings and thusmake migrating women more vulnerable to traffickers,158 and highlightedwomen’s rights advocates’ condemnation of anti-trafficking policies that in-volve the coercive and violent “rescue” and “rehabilitation” of sexworkers.159154 See BERNSTEIN, supra note 91, at 6, 9, 81–83.

TheSpecial Rapporteur on the Right to Health further noted that the law has ledto the arbitrary detention, sexual assault, and extortion of sex workers fol-lowing brothel raids.162In its 2014 review of India’s human rights record, the CEDAW Commit-tee expressed its concern for the “persecution of women in prostitution as aresult of measures taken to address trafficking, such as raid and rescue oper-ations.”163 This finding was related to a report that Indian sex workers’ rightsorganizations, including VAMP and the National Network of Sex Workers,submitted to the CEDAW Committee prior to India’s review, documentingabuses that arise from the conflation of sex work, trafficking, and migra-tion.164 “When trafficking is confused with women’s voluntary migration,”the report argued, “protectionist measures steeped in patriarchal control overwomen’s mobility result in curbing female migration within and outside theborders of the country.”165 In 2016, Amnesty—like HRW, also one of theworld’s most influential human rights nonprofit organizations—issued a re-port that documents violations of the rights of sex workers in Buenos Airesdue to the application of anti-trafficking laws that criminalize sex work. Thereport characterized the government’s anti-trafficking efforts as leading tothe targeting and punishment of sex workers who were adamant that theywere not, in fact, victims of human trafficking.166 The report discusses theharms resulting from anti-trafficking raids at length: “Every indoor sexworker interviewed for this report described being subjected to repeated160 HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH, Arbitrary Detention and Other Abuses against Sex Work-ers in Cambodia 28 (2010).161 Id.162 Anand Grover, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Right of Everyone to theEnjoyment of the Highest Attainable Standard of Physical and Mental Health, at ¶ 32,U.N.

Human Rights and the Legal Status of Sex Work1. International Human Rights Bodies Reject the Criminalization ofSex WorkCriminalization is a legal approach to sex work in which the sale,purchase, and/or all sex work-related activities such as solicitation, living offthe earnings of sex work, and brothel-keeping are illegal.168 Various interna-tional human rights bodies have directly linked the criminalization of sexwork to the human rights abuses they have documented against sex workers.As early as 1992, the CEDAW Committee issued General RecommendationNo. 19, which states that “[p]rostitutes are especially vulnerable to violencebecause their status, which may be unlawful, tends to marginalize them.”169It marked one of the first times that a global human rights body recognizedthe connection between the illegal status of sex work and human rightsabuses against sex workers. UN treaty bodies have also highlighted the di-rect link between criminalization of sex work and rights abuses against sexworkers in reviews of States Parties’ human rights records. In 2010, for ex-ample, the CEDAW Committee reviewed Fiji’s human rights record andnoted “[t]he Committee is concerned that sex work continues to becriminalized and that, as a result, sex workers are often victims of violenceand are particularly vulnerable to torture and ill-treatment by the police.”170In its 2017 review of Russia’s human rights record, the CESCR Committeestated it was “concerned that sex workers face obstacles in accessing health-care services owing to the criminalization of sex work.”171 That same year,167 Id. at 9, 27–30.168 See MGBAKO, supra note 7, at 147.169 CEDAW, CEDAW General Recommendation No. 19: Violence against women, at3, U.N.

See IWRAW-AP, Framework,supra note 47, at 14 (stating “The travaux preparatoires suggest that the CEDAW Con-vention did not intend to suppress ‘prostitution’ as such but rather the ‘exploitation ofprostitution.’ Whereas some delegations made proposals to broaden the purview of Arti-cle 6 to encompass prostitution generally, these proposals were ultimately dropped.”).170 CEDAW, Concluding Observations on the Committee on the Elimination of Dis-crimination against Women, Forty-sixth session, at 6, U.N.

International Human Rights Bodies Champion theDecriminalization of Sex WorkIn addition to criminalization, the other main legal approaches to sexwork include partial criminalization, legalization, and decriminalization.Under partial criminalization, also known as the “Nordic model,” thepurchase of sex and sex work-related activities are criminalized, while thesale of sex is technically decriminalized.174 Under legalization, the sale andpurchase of sex and sex work-related activities are legal only in certainhighly regulated circumstances that often include restrictive requirementslike mandatory health tests or public registration of sex workers. Sex work-ers and third parties who refuse or cannot adhere to these requirements re-main criminalized.175 Under decriminalization, the sale and purchase of sexand all sex work-related activities and third parties are fully decriminal-ized.176 Arguments that decriminalization gives “pimps”177 carte blanche toexploit people in the sex industry are incorrect: under decriminalization, al-though third party managers are decriminalized, the “facilitation of sexualservices remain subject to the same reasonable laws on coercion, exploita-172 Dainius Puˆras (Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment ofthe highest attainable standard of physical and mental health), Twenty-fourth Rep. on theEnjoyment of the Right to Health, at 12–14, U.N.

WHO and UNAIDS have issuedforceful calls for decriminalization. In 2012, WHO declared that “[a]llcountries should work toward decriminalization of sex work and eliminationof the unjust application of non-criminal laws and regulations against sexworkers.”181 In the same year, UNAIDS stressed that decriminalization mustinclude the removal of “criminal laws and penalties for purchase and sale ofsex, management of sex workers and brothels, and other activities related tosex work.”182 The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health argued in 2010that decriminalization is necessary to address the violations of the right tohealth sex workers experience because of criminalization.183 In 2013, theSpecial Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty issued a report calling for the fulldecriminalization of sex work in Namibia after meeting with Namibian sexworkers’ rights advocates during a country visit and documenting howcriminalization leads to discrimination, stigma, and violence.184HRW and Amnesty are two of the most high-profile groups to cham-pion decriminalization as the only human rights-based legal approach to sexwork. Prior to adopting a decriminalization policy in 2014, HRW had in itsearlier years emphasized the consequences of criminalization for victims offorced prostitution and maintained that it took “no position on prostitutionper se.”185 However, by the 2000s, HRW’s position on sex work began toevolve. The organization became an active opponent of United States policythat conditioned HIV/AIDS funding to nonprofit organizations on the adop-tion of an anti-prostitution policy.186 It also began issuing reports attributing178 Id. at 193.179 See GILLIAN ABLE, LISA FITZGERALD & CHERYL BRUNTON, THE IMPACT OF THEPROSTITUTION REFORM ACT ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY PRACTICES OF SEX WORKERS21–23 (2007).180 Coomaraswamy, supra note 157, at ¶ 21.181 WHO ET AL., PREVENTION AND TREATMENT, supra note 150, at 17.182 UNAIDS Guidance Note, supra note 148, at annex 6.183 Dainius Puˆras, Twenty-fourth Rep. on the Enjoyment of the Right to Health, supranote 172, at 2.184 Magdalena Sepulveda Carmona (Special Rapporteur), Report of the Special Rap-porteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, at 22, U.N.Doc A/HRC/23/36/Add.1(May 17, 2013).185 See HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH GLOBAL REPORT ON WO-MEN’S HUMAN RIGHTS 193 (1995).186 HRW issued public comments and joined a public interest lawsuit against thegovernment policy.

International Human Rights Bodies Should Highlight AbusesAssociated with the “Nordic Model” of Sex WorkAmnesty’s 2016 decriminalization policy was accompanied by four re-search reports on sex workers’ human rights, including, most notably, a re-port on Norway that documented human rights abuses associated with thelegal model of partial criminalization of sex work, in which sex work-relatedactivities, clients, and third parties are criminalized while sex workers areostensibly decriminalized.206 Amnesty’s issuance of a report firmly criticiz-ing the Nordic model at the same time it formally announced its decriminal-ization policy demonstrated that Amnesty understood and wanted tocommunicate the human rights distinction between the legal models of par-tial criminalization and decriminalization.Anti-prostitution activists support the Nordic model, which they charac-terize as decriminalizing the sellers of sex while criminally targeting the“demand” for paid sex.207 Despite this marketing, the Nordic model is, inpractice, a stigmatizing carceral paradigm that leads to human rights abusesagainst sex workers. Its primary goal is not the increased safety of peopleworking in the sex industry but the abolition of sex work.208 Even thoughpartial criminalization ostensibly decriminalizes sex workers, as long as sexwork-related activities, clients, and third parties remain criminalized, it issex workers who inevitably bear the brunt of the effects of partial criminal-ization. In its Norway report, Amnesty documented abuses sex workers inNorway suffer directly due to or compounded by partial criminalization.209For example, sex workers in Norway experience evictions because underpartial criminalization in Norway it is illegal for landlords to rent to sexworkers if they know that sex work may take place on the premises; policewill often threaten landlords with prosecution for promoting prostitution ifthey do not forcibly evict sex workers.210 Other harms sex workers in Nor-205 AMNESTY INT’L, Policy on State Obligations, supra note 173, at 2.206 AMNESTY INT’L, OUTLAWED AND ABUSED: CRIMINALIZING SEX WORK IN PAPUANEW GUINEA (2016); AMNESTY INT’L, HARMFULLY ISOLATED: CRIMINALIZING SEX WORKIN HONG KONG (2016); AMNESTY INT’L, “WHAT I’M DOING IS NOT A CRIME”: THEHUMAN COST OF CRIMINALIZING SEX WORK IN THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA(2016); AMNESTY INT’L, THE HUMAN COST OF ‘CRUSHING’ THE MARKET: CRIMINALIZA-TION OF SEX WORK IN NORWAY (2016).207 See, e.g., About this Project, EQUALITY NOW, https://www.equalitynow.org/about_this_project_intro [https://perma.cc/LE98-3G4P] (last visited July 31, 2019).208 See MGBAKO, supra note 7, at 148–49.

Rather, allof them create an environment of fear and marginalization for sex work-ers.”212 HRW has similarly critiqued partial criminalization:Human Rights Watch supports full decriminalization rather thanthe Nordic model because research shows that full decriminaliza-tion is a more effective approach to protecting sex workers’ rights.Sex workers themselves also usually want full decriminalization.The Nordic model appeals to some politicians as a compromisethat allows them to condemn buyers of sex but not people they seeas having been forced to sell sex. But the Nordic model actuallyhas a devastating impact on people who sell sex to earn a living.213The global sex workers’ rights movement has long maintained that theNordic model punishes sex workers.214 For example, partial criminalizationdecreases sex workers’ bargaining power with clients. Under partialcriminalization, to protect their criminalized clients from police detection,sex workers must often go to hidden locations where clients have more con-trol, and sex workers are thus more vulnerable to abuse. Sex workers mayalso have less time to determine whether potential clients are safe becausenervous clients fear police detention and so rush negotiations.215 It is illegalto “promote prostitution” under partial criminalization; therefore,“decriminalized” sex workers are not able to engage in activities that actu-ally make their work safer. For example, sex workers who live together orwork in tandem to increase their safety would be criminally liable for “pro-moting prostitution.”216 Landlords who accept rental payments from sexworkers risk being prosecuted for “promoting prostitution.”217 Bodyguards211 See id. at 46, 56, 61, 64.212 UNAIDS Guidance Note, supra note 148, at 4.213 HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH, Why Sex Work Should Be Decriminalized, supra note193.214 See MGBAKO, supra note 7, at 149.

The Nor-dic model does not view sex workers as rights bearing workers; it is there-fore unsurprising that under partial criminalization, sex workers do not haveaccess to labor rights or employment protections.220 One might argue thatpartial criminalization is, at least, preferable to total criminalization. In the-ory, this argument is not without merit—less criminalization is better thanmore criminalization. But in practice, as detailed above, under partialcriminalization, it is sex workers who continue to suffer: they are surveilled,harassed, evicted, deported, made poorer, criminalized for engaging in activ-ities to increase their safety like living and working together, and the powerimbalance that already exists between them and their clients is worsened.The partial criminalization model has, alarmingly, already spread fromSweden to France, Iceland, Norway, and Northern Ireland.221 Other interna-tional human rights bodies should follow the lead of Amnesty, UNAIDS,and HRW and help stem the spread of this harmful legal model by drawingattention to its incompatibility with sex workers’ rights and actively distin-guishing it from decriminalization. The CEDAW Committee, for instance,has been inconsistent in its characterization of decriminalization and hasfailed to adequately address the human rights implications of partialcriminalization. In its 2010 review of Fiji’s human rights record, the CEDAWCommittee encouragingly called for “decriminalizing sex work.” 222 Yet, inits 2016 review of Canada, the CEDAW Committee called only for“decriminaliz[ing] women engaged in prostitution,”223 an embrace of theNordic model. One of the topics at issue in the CEDAW Committee’s reviewof Canada was a proposed law based on the Nordic model. As part of Ca-nada’s review, a consortium of Canadian sex workers’ rights organizationssubmitted a report of supplementary information to the CEDAW Committeehighlighting in great detail the risks posed to sex workers under the proposedlegal model of partial criminalization.224 Although the CEDAW Committeebriefly noted its concern regarding potential risks to sex workers’ health and218 AMNESTY INT’L, THE HUMAN COST OF “CRUSHING” THE MARKET, supra note206, at 64, 92.219 See MGBAKO, supra note 7, at 148.

This was a failure on the part of the CEDAWCommittee that for the sake of sex workers, who suffer under partialcriminalization models, must be avoided by other human rights bodies.There is a vast human rights distinction between partial criminalization,which seeks to abolish sex work by targeting “demand,” and decriminaliza-tion, where the primary goal is the realization of sex workers’ rights. Morehuman rights mechanisms should acquire a nuanced understanding of thehuman rights difference between partial criminalization and decriminaliza-tion, identify abuses against sex workers linked to partial criminalization,and reject the Nordic model as incompatible with the realization of sexworkers’ human rights. As sex workers’ rights activists and authors Juno Macand Molly Smith powerfully note, “to decriminalize sex work is to treat asimportant the immediate, material safety of people who are sellingsex. . .[D]ecriminalization is a deeply radical demand, far more so thanthrowing the world’s poorest sex workers to the wolves in an attempt toannihilate the sex industry through increased policing.”226E. International Human Rights Bodies Should Advance a Holistic Visionof Decriminalization of Sex Work that Embracesa Labor Rights FrameworkInternational human rights bodies should embrace an expansive visionof decriminalization that includes labor rights. The removal of criminal andother laws targeting sex workers, buyers, third parties, and sex work-relatedactivities is an important first step in the decriminalization model. However,to fully realize sex workers’ human rights, decriminalization must include alabor rights framework.227 International human rights bodies that have advo-cated for decriminalization have rarely given prominence to this vital secondstep. Amnesty’s decriminalization policy, for instance, makes no mention ofsex workers’ labor rights.228 Due to criminalization, sex workers routinelyexperience such violations of their right to work as theft of wages, work-place sexual harassment, and lack of access to labor laws, overtime pay,employee benefits, occupational health and safety standards, collective or-ganizing, and formal employment grievance procedures.229 Therefore, even ifsex work is decriminalized, sex workers will not be able to exercise power225 CEDAW, Concluding Observations on the Combined Eighth and Ninth PeriodicReports of Canada, supra note 223, at 11.226 See MAC & SMITH, supra note 91, at 207.227 See MGBAKO, supra note 7, at 157.

Sex workers work in various setups: independently, collectivelywith other sex workers, or with third parties like managers in brothels, mas-sage parlors, escort agencies, and other settings who facilitate the logisticalaspects of their work in exchange for a cut of their earnings.233 Many ofthese third party relationships are abusive because legal models of sex workcriminalization, in which sex workers have no recognized rights as laborers,ensure sex workers remain vulnerable to and have no real recourse from thisabuse.234 Partial criminalization is no panacea in this regard. When managersare criminalized but sex workers still depend on them for financial and otherassistance, this increases the power of managers and decreases the power ofsex workers, often leading to exploitative situations in which the sex workeris forced to accept economic mistreatment in order to protect her own liveli-hood by protecting the manager.235Decriminalizing the industry strengthens the hand of the sex workerand increases her power over her labor: under decriminalization, the sexworker is a legally recognized worker, and, therefore, if a manager is eco-nomically exploiting a sex worker, the sex worker has access to the rightsand recourses of other workers. The empowerment of sex workers as work-ers with state-recognized rights is a welcome threat to the power of manag-ers who try to exploit them in the shadows of carceral regimes.

For instance,the 1985 World Charter for Prostitutes’ Rights, the 2005 Declaration on theRights of Sex Workers in Europe, and the 2013 Consensus Statement on SexWork, Human Rights, and the Law are formal movement documents that allinclude demands for the realization of sex workers’ labor rights.240International rights bodies should examine whether government lawsand policies facilitate or hinder sex workers’ labor rights. Some mechanismshave inched in this direction. As noted earlier, the CEDAW Committee’s236 See IWRAW-AP, Framework, supra note 47, at 16.237 GLOB.

However, otherhuman rights bodies, such as the CEDAW and Human Rights Committees—despite hav-ing institutionalized the idea that human rights apply to sex workers—unfortunately stillgenerally use terms that rob sex workers of agency, including “women in prostitution.”See, e.g., Human Rights Committee, Concluding Observations on the Initial Reports ofGhana, supra note 122, at 3; CEDAW, Concluding Observations on the Combined Eighthand Ninth Periodic Reports of Canada, supra note 223, at 12.240 See PHETERSON, supra note 8, at 40–41; SEX WORK EUROPE, supra note 63, at 11; RCONSENSUS STATEMENT, supra note 4, at 23–25.\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\H\\HLG\\43-1\\HLG103.txt unknown Seq: 42 29-JAN-20 12:48132 Harvard Journal of Law & Gender [Vol. 432013 review of Hungary’s human rights record included an affirmation ofsex workers’ right to safe working conditions.241 The International Labor Or-ganization, a UN agency that develops standards, policies, and programs onlabor rights, has noted that it recognizes sex workers as laborers in the infor-mal economy.242  Human rights bodies, though, must do much more. Onepositive example is the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health’s 2010report, which contained exemplary exhortations on sex workers’ labor rightsand a call for States to “repeal all laws criminalizing sex work and practicesaround it, and to establish appropriate regulatory frameworks within whichsex workers can enjoy the safe working conditions to which they are enti-tled.”243 The report went on to argue that[w]hen sex workers are not recognized as engaging in legitimatework, they are not recognized by standard labour laws in manycountries. Sex workers often cannot gain access to State benefits,and are not protected by occupational health and safety regulationsthat routinely protect employees in other industries. . . . Moreover,the criminalization of practices related to sex work can create bar-riers to the realization of safe working conditions.244Other human rights bodies should no longer shy away from a similarly full-throated embrace of sex workers’ rights as labor rights. The championing ofa labor rights framework is critical to the advancement of the full realizationof sex workers’ human rights.IV. SEX WORKERS’ RIGHTS ADVOCATES ATTEMPT TO DOMESTICALLYENFORCE THEIR GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTSLegal scholar Harold Koh has argued that human rights are enforced,however imperfectly, through a three-stage “transnational legal process.”245The process includes 1) “institutional interaction whereby global norms ofinternational human rights law are debated,”246 2) “interpretation of legal241 See CEDAW, Concluding Observations on the Combined Seventh and Eighth Pe-riod Reports of Hungary, supra note 152, at 6.242 See IWRAW-AP, Framework, supra note 47, at 16.

It underscored theimportant role sex workers’ rights advocates play in stage one of the processwhen, during “institutional interaction” with human rights bodies, they pro-vide evidence of human rights violations against sex workers. It documentedhow, in stage two of the process, human rights bodies’ “interpretation oflegal norms” have resulted in the normative application of human rightslegal protections to sex workers. Part IV will address the third stage by of-fering a series of brief examples of attempts by sex workers’ rights advocatesto compel government actors to “internalize” sex workers’ globally recog-nized human rights into the domestic sphere. It will further demonstrate howadvocates bolster their advocacy by referencing human rights bodies’ main-streaming of sex workers’ rights.Sex workers’ rights advocates have used international recommendationsand judgments from the UPR, UN Special Procedures, UN treaty bodies, andregional human rights systems to pressure their governments to act on sexworkers’ rights at the domestic level. For example, following the 2010 UPRreview of the United States, which resulted in a formal recommendation tothe United States concerning sex workers’ rights, sex workers’ rights organi-zations formed a working group called Human Rights for All that conductedsophisticated advocacy to encourage the government to accept and imple-ment the recommendation, includingthe development of a “call to action” addressed to the US govern-ment (signed by more than 150 academics, public health leaders,and supporting organisations including national and internationalhuman rights groups); the garnering of support from high-profileleaders in the fields of health, criminology, and women’s rights;the development of a policy brief tailored to the US federal gov-ernment context. . .and an educational campaign to inform con-gressional leaders about the critical issues sex workers face andoffer some potential viable solutions.249In another case, after the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty issuedits 2013 report that called for the decriminalization of sex work in Namibia,Namibian sex workers’ rights advocates used the report as a catalyst to beginformal talks with Namibian members of parliament on the legal status of sex247 Id.248 Id.249 Kari Lerum, Kiesha McCurtis, Penelope Saunders & Stephanie Wahab, UsingHuman Rights to Hold the US Accountable for Its Anti-Sex Trafficking Agenda: The Uni-versal Periodic Review and New Directions for US Policy, 1 ANTI-TRAFFICKING REV., 80,95–96, (2012).\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\H\\HLG\\43-1\\HLG103.txt unknown Seq: 44 29-JAN-20 12:48134 Harvard Journal of Law & Gender [Vol. 43work in the country.250 In 2017, sex workers’ rights advocates in Europe usedthe European Court of Human Rights’ 2012 judgment in B.S. v. Spain, whichaffirmed the rights of an African migrant sex worker who suffered policeabuse, as a basis for arguing in the case of Koutra & Katzaki v. Greece thatthe court should enforce Greece’s legal obligation to respect the rights oftransgender sex workers who likewise face extreme levels of stateviolence.251Sex workers’ rights advocates have also referenced positive findingsfrom UN agencies to advance their on-the-ground advocacy. In 2005, forexample, in the Declaration on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe, advo-cates cited UN agencies’ institutionalization of sex workers’ rights:legislative measures that restrict the fundamental rights and free-doms of sex workers proliferate at local, national, and internationallevels, claiming to be in the interests of combating organizedcrime and promoting public health. However, many of these mea-sures are implemented against the policy and principles set out byadvice of UNAIDS and World Health Organisation.252Advocates have similarly used media advocacy to bring attention to humanrights bodies’ institutionalization of the rights of sex workers and to pushtheir domestic agenda. In 2017, for example, sex workers’ rights advocatesin Central and Eastern Europe issued a press release hailing the CESCRCommittee’s findings regarding violations of sex workers’ rights in Russia.253Advocates have likewise embraced official calls by human rights bod-ies for the decriminalization of sex work, which bolsters their advocacy con-cerning the legal status of sex work. UNAIDS and the United NationsDevelopment Program (UNDP) convened the Global Commission on HIVand the Law (“Commission”), which was comprised of highly respectedindependent international experts who published a 2012 report that called forthe full decriminalization of sex work.254 A group of anti-prostitution organi-zations, including the nonprofit organization Equality Now, immediatelycondemned the Commission’s stance, argued in favor of the Nordic model,250 Telephone Interview conducted by Morganne Barrett with Tomas Zapata, Re-gional Advisor Human Resources for Health at World Health Organization (Oct. 25,2018).251 Transgender Europe, ILGA Europe, Greek Transgender Support Association, In-ternational Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe, Written Comments in theEuropean Court of Human Rights, Electa Leda Koutra and Anastasia Katzaki, no. 459/16(July 13, 2017).252 SEX WORK EUROPE, supra note 63, at 1.253 See UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Recommends RussiaDecriminalise Sex Work, SWANNET, (Oct. 23, 2017), http://www.swannet.org/en/content/un-committee-economic-social-and-cultural-rights-recommends-russia-decriminalise-sex-work [https://perma.cc/9LJV-AESF].254 GLOBAL COMMISSION ON HIV AND THE LAW, RISKS, RIGHTS, AND HEALTH 3, 10(2012).\\\\jciprod01\\productn\\H\\HLG\\43-1\\HLG103.txt unknown Seq: 45 29-JAN-20 12:482020] The Mainstreaming of Sex Workers’ Rights as Human Rights 135and called on the Commission to “listen to survivors” of sex trafficking.255Sex workers’ rights advocates were uncowed and issued statements vigor-ously defending the Commission’s conclusions and pushing back againstEquality Now’s exhortations.256 “When Equality Now suggests ‘we listen’—who are they suggesting we listen to?” asked Kholi Buthelezi, the directorof the sex worker-led South African movement Sisonke. “I would like themto listen to me and other sex workers who participated in the deliberations ofthe Commission.”257 Indeed, while anti-prostitution activists argue that allsex work is inherently coercive,258 a human rights-based approach dictatesthat policies should reflect the needs and vocalized desires of directly af-fected communities: in this case, people currently in the sex work industry,whose lives and health are materially affected by sex work law and policydecisions. Sex workers have been clear, decade after decade, that criminal-ization in any form has deleterious effects on their health and well-being andincreases their susceptibility to exploitation and abuse. Amnesty’s 2016highly publicized policy on the decriminalization of sex work similarly rein-forced sex worker advocacy, as was the case when sex workers’ rights advo-cates in South Africa used the media interest in the Amnesty policy toannounce the launch of a broad law reform coalition to campaign for thedecriminalization of sex work in South Africa called Asijiki, which means“no turning back” in Zulu.259 “With every nongovernmental organisationthat adopts a rights-based approach to sex workers’ rights,” wrote NSWP inreflecting on the Amnesty policy’s effect on sex worker advocacy, “theNSWP and its members have more research, reports, policies, and agenciesto back-up what sex workers have known from the beginning: criminalisa-tion of sex workers, clients, and third parties puts sex workers at risk.”260These examples of attempts by sex workers’ rights advocates to domes-ticate globally recognized sex workers’ rights show the movement under-stands the central role it must play in transforming the institutionalization ofsex workers’ human rights by human rights bodies in global forums intovictories for sex workers on the ground. By affirming sex workers’ rights,human rights bodies have afforded the movement an international mandateto pursue this agenda of domestic transformation.

The Article also documented institutionalization byhuman rights bodies of the concept of sex workers’ human rights and high-lighted sex workers’ rights advocates’ efforts to domesticate this institution-alization. This mainstreaming of sex workers’ rights as human rights shouldmark the end of feminist debates regarding sex work. In these debates, anti-prostitution activists, whose ranks are populated by people who have neversold sex or have exited the sex industry, characterize sex work itself as aninherent human rights violation.262 The sex workers’ rights movement—dom-inated by people currently working in the sex industry whose lives are mostdirectly affected by sex work law and policy—reject this characterizationand point, instead, to the oppression of the carceral state as the cause ofhuman rights abuses against sex workers.263 The mainstreaming of sex work-ers’ human rights means the sex workers’ rights movement is largely winningthis argument in influential global forums. Human rights bodies have implic-itly upended anti-prostitution arguments regarding sex work’s supposed in-herent harm by clearly identifying criminalization as a primary cause ofrights violations against sex workers and by calling for the full decriminal-ization of sex work. It is sex workers’ political, social, and economic fate—and their lives—that are at stake, and it is their perspectives, their coura-geous and determined global voices, that must take center stage on any issueconcerning the realization of sex workers’ human rights.261 See Kari Lerum et al., supra note 249, at 102–03 (citing in part Harold Koh in hisconcluding statement to the Human Rights Council).262 See MGBAKO, supra note 7, at 4–5; Alexander, supra note 94, at 84; MAC & RSMITH, supra note 91, at 13–14.263 See MGBAKO, supra note 7, at 4–5; Alexander, supra note 94, at 84; MAC & RSMITH, supra note 91, at 38.",
