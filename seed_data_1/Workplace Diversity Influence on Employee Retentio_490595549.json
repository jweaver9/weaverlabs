Workplace Diversity Influence on Employee Retention  in Organizations during the COVID-19   Nachayapat Rodprayoon1, Stanislaw Paul Maj2  Received: September 24, 2021. Revised: October 18, 2021. Accepted: November 1, 2021.   Abstract The purpose of this study is to identify the factors influencing workplace diversity on employee retention in organizations during the COVID-19. In this study, the researchers aim to determine which factors will be the most effect on workplace diversity on employee retention in organizations during the COVID-19 variables in this study consisting of Supervisory relationship, perceived organizational support, perceived working climate, peer group interaction, diversity, and inclusion in the workplace engagement, and perceived organizational support. A total of 260 participants, which contain specific characteristics such as designation in human resource and non-human resource, gender, industry sectors, nature of industry, ownership, and age range. Both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were used in data analysis such as frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and multiple linear regression (MLR) to describe the demographic profile and the causal relationship between variables. In this study, results revealed that perceived working climate (PWC), supervisory relationship (SR), peer group interaction (PGI), and perceived organizational support (POS) have a positive significant effect on diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement (DIW) at a p-value less than .05, also, diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement (DIW) and perceived organizational support (POS) have a positive significant effect on employee retention during COVID-19 which all hypotheses support the null hypothesis.

Introduction  Globalization in this modern time has activated compared to previously more interactions between people of different cultures and backgrounds. People are open in the world with a challenge for almost anywhere on the continent. According to Fleury (1999), the author said that variety is defined in the same social system as a mix of    1Nachayapat Rodprayoon, D.B.A., Information Systems Department, Faculty of Business Administration, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, Thailand.

Organizational variety is formed by groups of people, which the differences towards \"race, geographic origin, ethnicity, age, educational, physical and cognitive capacity, language, lifestyles, beliefs, cultural background, economy, the mandate with the organization and the sexual preference \"were revealed in the study by Bhadury et al. (2000).  In addition, the variety can be classified into two sizes. The primary size, such as age, gender, sexual orientation, etc., shows the main differences between different people. These primary deviations also have the most significant influence on the first meetings. They can quickly notice and serve as screens through which people can consider the world, in secondary sizes such as religion, education, geographical Nachayapat Rodprayoon, Stanislaw Paul Maj / AU-GSB e-Journal Vol 14 No 2 (2021) 130-143                                               131  position, income, etc., which support these potentials that are not perceptible to the first meeting and can change during various meetings. These properties are simply noticed after some collaboration between individuals (Ashton, 2010) occur.  Organizations in their perspective to adopt various in the workplace or in the organization to become more creative and open. Due to the recognition of the workplace, the increase and improvement of diversity in the workplace has become an essential topic in management areas. The variety may be a problem for an organization, but it could also be a solution, but also comes with its disadvantages, but also advantages and dangerous, but also constructive. The challenge is to extract the nature of the variety and tactically handle it for the improvement of people and the organization. As diversity management remains a challenge in organizations, leaders tend to learn the necessary leadership expertise in a multicultural work environment and prepare to teach others in their organizations, assess cultural differences and treat all employees with dignity. In some aspects of executives and managers, variety is a great challenge if no organizational boundary knows and no limits. In recent years, the administration of the diversity and diversity of the labor force has been considerable and forced as such companies that have forced these concepts in their businesses intending to increase productivity and profit. This forced integration has created divergence and uncertainty about the labor force because the administration is unable to control the concept of diversity and ethics management and that managers are difficult to effectively find the management of the variety, which in turn has its neck has been a burden. Managers have difficulty finding the factors that contribute to effective management of specific diversity or tasks that can be effectively achieved and effectively with diversity issues in the workplace. At the end of this study, considerable theoretical work is considered to determine the factors that could lead to the formation of a favorable work environment that affects the management of diversity. It is also essential to define the impact on companies' creation on companies to create a favorable working atmosphere by managing the variety of the workplace. The COVID-19 is challenging companies everywhere in the world with a discouraging degree of technology disruption. Many business companies face devastating losses of revenue, dislocations to operations and supply chains, and challenges to liquidity and solvency. Moreover, the impact of the COVID-19 is causing businesses to concern about their workforce. Every business and industry sector is being impacted differently. Some organizations can have at least some of their employees working remotely. In times like these, supporting people to remain productive through remote working and resultantly helping alleviate some of their challenges is imperative. Some of these challenges are using technology to its full potential to remain connected, working with children at home, concerns about their health and that of their loved ones, social disconnection, and mental health. These are amazingly adaptable, but we need to work together to help employees work through these changes. Organizations will need a great deal of resolve and establish resilience as they seek to navigate an economically and socially viable path toward the \"next new-normal\" situations. In completing this study, applicable theoretical works are considered to discover the factors that possibly will lead to a favorable working environment of diversity management during the COVID-19. In reality, it is also essential to establish the implications this has had on companies to create a very conducive working atmosphere through virtual workplace diversity management during the COVID-19. Therefore, this study tries to find the workplace diversity of organizational factors that play the essential factors to keep employees staying within the organization, especially with the emphasis on supporting the working environment.     2. Review of Literature and Hypotheses Formulation   2.1 Employee turnover and employee retention   According to March and Simon (1958), an individual's intention to stay is balanced by the organization's incentives and the individual's expected contribution. Employee retention is one of the most critical factors for determining an organization's strength. Employee engagement originated from emotional commitment, but organizational engagement is separate from commitment. Meanwhile, employee retention is the percentage of employees who remain with an employer over a given time. Companies that have more long-term employees will have a higher employee retention rate. As well as companies that have a lot of short-term employees will have a lower employee retention rate. However, employee turnover is the rate at which employees leave a company during a certain period. When employee turnover is high, it leaves companies scrambling to find new employees to replace them. These replacements are costly. They can also dismantle an organization over time as they lose knowledgeable and skilled workers. Businesses that know their employee turnover rate can monitor changes and learn how to keep employees from leaving. They can also use it to predict the impact on employee productivity and morale (Richman et al., 2008). Calculating employee turnover rate, companies usually consider the following: 1) Terminations, 2) Retirements, 3) Voluntary resignations, 4) Layoffs, 5) 132                                    Nachayapat Rodprayoon, Stanislaw Paul Maj / AU-GSB e-Journal Vol 14 No 2 (2021) 130-143  Location transfers, and 6) Deaths. Employee retention, employee satisfaction, and retention are seen as the cornerstones of organizational success, according to Osteraker (1999). Knippenberg (2000) proposed that when employees identify with a group and contribute to its performance, they become more loyal and stay in the organization. On the other hand, Gering and Conner (2002) feel that keeping good employees is vital for every organization. If the organization cannot keep its personnel, it will not benefit from human assets produced within the company. Literature and best practices show that when organizations regard their employees as valued contributors, they are more likely to stay with the company. It is consequently critical that organizations keep their employees pleased to enhance employee retention. According to Kakar et al. (2017), many organizations have difficulties developing an employee retention plan. If employees are dissatisfied with their organizations, they tend to resign; as a result, turnover rates in many organizations are growing. Furthermore, refer to Mercer (2003), employees will stay in an organization if they are appropriately compensated, but they may quit if they are not. Employees are more inclined to stay in organizations if they think their skills, talents, and efforts are valued (Davies, 2001). Gomez-Mejia et al. (2012) observed both internal and external equity in terms of the remuneration if the compensation package is used as a retention strategy. To assure enhanced employee performance and retention, organizations must learn about various acceptable approaches to reward employees for achieving the intended results. It has been claimed that the degree to which employees are pleased with their careers and willing to stay with an organization is a consequence of their compensation packages and reward structure. Employees' inclination to remain with the organization is heavily influenced by the organization's compensation.  2.2 Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace  According to Deloitte (2021), diverse companies enjoy 2.3 times higher cash flow per employee. Gartner (2020) found that inclusive teams improve team performance by up to 30 percent in high-diversity environments. Companies with diverse management teams had a 19 percent increase in revenue compared to their less diverse counterparts. Although diversity and inclusion offer clear benefits, it is challenging to implement. A significant issue is that many companies believe they are already promoting a diverse and inclusive culture. However, only 40 percent of employees agree that their manager fosters an inclusive environment. They pointed out that \"we need to do more than diversity and equity and inclusion in human resources functions. We need to create real belonging in our culture.\" In its business environment, they have gone so far as to reframe diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts as DEIB, which stands for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging. Therefore, the philosophy on diversity and inclusion is rooted in two themes: connection with the supportive work environment and belonging by organizational engagement. These elements must go hand-in-hand in the workplace in order to truly make an impact.  2.3 Supportive work environment and diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement  Engagement is a vital strategy for retaining personnel in organizations (Glen, 2006). Engaged employees offer a competitive advantage to diversity and inclusion in workplace engagement, so organizations must continuously engage them to achieve strategic goals and produce vital business results. In-depth analysis of past studies has revealed that perceived organizational support and support from colleagues in diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004) predict organizational engagement among employees. Richman et al. (2008) have stated that organizational engagement can be enhanced through perceived organizational justice, good employee–job fit, and perceived organizational support among diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement. They further opine that to retain valuable employees, organizations need to create an environment that posits the person-job fit and provides career development and vast growth opportunities. The supportive work environment with perceived flexibility and supportive work-life policies is the best predictor of diversity and inclusion in workplace engagement and expected retention. Diversity and inclusion in the workplace engaged employees look to be more committed to the organization and bring good business results. Peer relationships, supervisory relationships, organizational policies and procedures, supportive work climate, and workplace environment are integral elements of a positive work climate that foster employee engagement (Shuck et al., 2010). Based on the discussion above, it is clearly stated that a supportive work environment leads to an engaged workforce.   2.3.1 Perceived Working Climate A healthy work environment fosters discretionary behavior action (Janssen, 2000; Gilbreath, 2004) and initiatives to achieve desirable behavior. Furthermore, Lingard and Francis (2006) found that a supportive work environment in the context of perceived organizational support, peer group interaction, and supervisory relationships moderate the link between job burnout and work-life balance issues. Moreover, Hytter (2007) has Nachayapat Rodprayoon, Stanislaw Paul Maj / AU-GSB e-Journal Vol 14 No 2 (2021) 130-143                                               133  shown that workplace characteristics such as compensation, leadership style, career prospects, training and development, physical working climate, and work-life balance indirectly impact retention. Ramlall (2003) has postulated that individuals try to work for an organization that creates a pleasant work atmosphere and correctly appreciates employees' efforts. According to Kyndt et al. (2009), personal perceptions (self-perceived leadership abilities and learning attitude) and organizational (appreciation, stimulation, and job pressure) variables have a favorable impact on employee retention. “Employees do not quit their companies, and they quit their bosses” is a well-known adage that has been experimentally proven in the context of voluntary turnover. Furthermore, positive supervision is a critical component of a psychologically healthy work environment (Gilbreath, 2004). Employees' job participation is increased when they receive psychosocial assistance at work. Employees are more inclined to remain in a positive work environment and vice versa. Recognizing workers' achievements and caring for their well-being improves employee retention (Ghosh et al., 2013; Eisenberger et al., 2002). Supervisory assistance at the organizational level can reduce anxiety and increase job satisfaction and employee retention. Supervisory conduct has a direct relationship with subordinate absenteeism (Ghosh et al., 2013).  2.3.2 Supervisory Relationship  The supervisory relationship is essential in evaluating an employee's performance. A positive superior-subordinate relationship in feedback, information sharing, performance assessment, recognition, reciprocity, trustworthiness, and collaboration can significantly improve management retention (Lancaster & Milia, 2015; Ghosh & Sahney, 2011).  2.3.3 Peer Group Interaction  Peer Group Interaction has also been a significant indicator affecting retention level. In human relationships, a supportive organizational environment promotes management performance (Bamel et al., 2013). Organizational support is closely connected to inclusion and recognition by senior management. Both co-workers and management support lead to innovative work behavior by contributing to new ideas (Ma Prieto & Pérez-Santana, 2014).  2.3.4 Perceived Organizational Support  Organizational support, infrastructure, career development, inter-unit assistance, top management support, senior support, employee well-being, and work-life balance all benefit employee retention (Ghosh & Sahney, 2011). Organizations enhance employee retention by enlisting the assistance of senior management. Employee attitudes are positively influenced by a high degree of organizational support, and the intention to stay with the organization is stimulated (Taylor et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2008). According to Wayne et al. (1997), individuals who sense more support from their engaged organizations are more likely to feel obliged to their organizations. It has been discovered that perceived organizational support strongly predicts employees' behavioral intentions (Saks, 2006). Based on the preceding explanation, it is evident that a supportive work environment leads to a more engaged workforce. Based on the above theoretical and empirical studies, the following hypotheses can be stated: H1. Supportive work environment in the perceived working climate is positively and significantly related to diversity and inclusion in workplace engagement. H2. Supportive work environment in the supervisory relationship is positively and significantly related to diversity and inclusion in workplace engagement. H3. Supportive work environment in peer-group interaction is positively and significantly related to diversity and inclusion in workplace engagement. H4. Supportive work environment in perceived organizational support is positively and significantly related to diversity and inclusion in workplace engagement.  2.4 Supportive work environment and employee retention during COVID-19  A supportive work environment is viewed as a climatic factor such as supervisory or peers support and the constraint and opportunity to perform learned behavior on the job (Baldwin & Ford, 1988). Employees feel supported and encouraged in a supportive work environment. The work environment factor includes supervisory support, organizational support, and peer support. Organizational support theory and social support theory propagate how \"organizational support\" builds affective commitment among employees and strengthens their emotional connection with the organization (Rhoades et al., 2001). A supportive work environment boosts the interest levels of employees towards their jobs, in turn improving their productivity (Ma Prieto and Pérez-Santana, 2014). Further, it serves as a valuable input for desired behavior among employees and, therefore, develops innovative work behavior. Previous studies have revealed that a Supportive work environment results in higher organizational commitment (Rhoades et al., 2001) and improved employee retention (Eisenberger et al., 2002). Interpersonal relationships and a well-nurtured environment enable managerial retention in organizations (Ghosh & Sahney, 2011). Supportive organizational practices are found to have a significant effect on employee turnover (Huselid, 1995). Positive supervision is negatively related to 134                                    Nachayapat Rodprayoon, Stanislaw Paul Maj / AU-GSB e-Journal Vol 14 No 2 (2021) 130-143  employee turnover. Further, the extent to which employees feel that their employing organizations and their employers value their contributions care for their well-being is inversely related to voluntary turnover (Eisenberger et al., 2002).  Thus, it can be concluded that the perceived work environment reciprocates employee retention. A healthy work environment develops discretionary behavior action (Gilbreath, 2004) and projects to pursue desired behavior. In addition, Lingard and Francis (2006) have reported that a supportive work environment in the context of perceived organizational support, co-worker relations, and supervisory relationships moderates the relationship between job burnout and work-family conflicts. Hytter (2007) has also demonstrated that workplace factors such as rewards, leadership style, career opportunities, training and development of skills, physical working conditions, and work-life balance indirectly influence retention. Ramlall (2003) has postulated that people attempt to work for those organizations wherein a pleasant work environment is provided, and employees' contributions are adequately valued. Kyndt et al. (2009) has explored that personal (self-perceived leadership skills and learning attitude) and organizational (appreciation, stimulation, and pressure of work) factors have a positive influence on employee retention. Hiring the right people and strategically embedding them in the organizational culture enhances the competitive advantage of organizations and reduces employee turnover (Dawson & Abbott, 2011). Organizations create a supportive learning environment through the influence of organizational culture and leadership. \"Employees don't quit their companies, and they quit their bosses\" is a famous proverb that has been empirically proved in the context of voluntary turnover (Mathieu et al., 2016). Positive supervision is an essential module of a psychologically healthy work climate (Gilbreath, 2004). Psychosocial support received at the workplace enhances employees' job involvement (Chan et al., 2008). Ghosh and Sahney (2011) have explored that organizational social (perceived supervisory relationship, peer-group interaction, and person-organization fit) and technical subsystems (managerial job characteristics, work technology support, and perceived organizational support) that have a significant impact on the managerial job. Employees are more likely to stay when there is a positive work environment and vice versa. Recognition of employees' contributions and concern for their welfare enhance employee retention (Eisenberger et al., 2002). Supervisory support at the organizational level can reduce anxiety and induce higher job satisfaction and employee retention. Supervisory behavior is directly related to subordinate absenteeism. Supervisor relationship plays a prominent role in appraising an employee's performance. Positive superior-subordinate relationships in terms of sharing feedback, information, performance appraisal, recognition, reciprocity, trustworthiness, and cooperation can significantly enhance managerial retention. Co-workers' support is also an important indicator of retention level (Ng & Sorensen, 2008; Bamel et al., 2013). The supportive organizational climate in interpersonal relationships improves managerial effectiveness. Top management's inclusion and recognition are directly related to organizational support (Wayne et al., 1997). (Ma Prieto and Pérez-Santana, 2014) poited out that both co-worker support and management support lead to innovative work behavior in an organization, as they contribute to innovative ideas. Organizational support, infrastructure, career development, inter-unit support, top management support, senior support, compensation, employee well-being, and work-life balance positively influence personnel retention in organizations. Organizations improve employee retention by exploring top management support (Taylor et al., 2010). A high level of organizational support positively influences employee attitudes and stimulates the intention to stay with the organization (Eisenberger et al., 1986; Ramlall, 2003; Chan et al., 2008). Wayne et al. (1997) have found that individuals who perceive more significant support from their engaging organizations are more likely to feel indebted to their organizations. Perceived organizational support is a significant predictor of employees' behavioral intentions. Thus, based on the literature mentioned above, the following hypothesis can be proposed:  H5. Supportive work environment in perceived organizational support is positively and significantly related to employee retention during COVID-19.  2.5 Diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement and employee retention   The organizational engagement has become a hot topic among practitioners. Based on a survey of 50,000 employees in 27 countries, Lockwood (2007) has reported that engagement is directly linked to business success and employee retention in organizations. Evidence indicates that an engaged and committed workforce can abundantly benefit the organization prominently in lower turnover intentions and reduced absenteeism. Due to intense market rivalry, organizations need to align their strategic goals with individual goals to create organizational engagement (Nutov & Hazzan, 2014; de Lange et al., 2008; Allen et al., 2003). Kahn (1990) has predicted that engagement leads to individual and organizational results in terms of the quality of people's work and productivity. Engagement results from a more substantial commitment to the organization, greater job satisfaction, and an improved work environment (Harter et al., 2002). Employee engagement enhances Nachayapat Rodprayoon, Stanislaw Paul Maj / AU-GSB e-Journal Vol 14 No 2 (2021) 130-143                                               135  organizational outcomes, such as productivity, safety, profitability, and turnover, while organizational engagement improves employee and organizational performance (Richman et al., 2008; Harter et al., 2002). Trusts in senior management and procedural justice are significant predictors of organizational engagement. Employees who trust the senior management show higher levels of engagement and lower intention to quit the organization (Malinen et al., 2013). Juhdi et al. (2013) have found that certain HRM practices such as compensation, rewards, developmental opportunities, career management, person-job fit, and job control influence organizational engagement. De Lange et al. (2008) have stipulated that high work engagement retains and motivates the personnel, whereas the absence of work engagement results in an increased departure from the organization. Schaufeli and Bakker (2004) found that employee engagement is negatively related to employee turnover intention. Several other studies have also revealed a negative correlation between work engagement and intention to leave (Harter et al., 2002; Saks, 2006; de Lange et al., 2008; Agarwal, 2016). In the words of Bhatnagar (2007), engagement has a significant influence on organizational outcomes, employee efficiency, and employee retention.  Organizational engagement anticipates employee outcome, organizational success, and financial performance (Juhdi et al., 2013). Schaufeli and Bakker (2004) have revealed that engagement mediates the relationship between job resources and turnover intention. They have also demonstrated that engagement works as a motivational tool, while high job resources lead to higher engagement and reduced employee turnover. Organizational engagement mediates the relationship between antecedents (job characteristics, rewards, and recognition, perceived supervisor support, perceived organizational support, procedural justice, and distributive justice) and outcomes (job satisfaction, intention to quit, organizational commitment, and organizational citizenship behavior) of the organization (Saks, 2006; Maslach et al., 2001). Organizational engagement is related to employees' attitudes, intentions, and behaviors towards the organization. Engagement works as a mediating variable between work conditions and work outcomes. Malinen et al. (2013) have also investigated the mediating effects of organizational engagement between trust, procedural justice, and withdrawal attitudes and found that more engaged employees are less likely to leave the organization. Bhatnagar (2007) has explored that engagement works as a mediator between talent management practices and employee retention. Organizational engagement also mediators between HR practices (career management, person-job fit, pay satisfaction, performance appraisal, and job control) and turnover intention (Juhdi et al., 2013). Thus, the hypothesis can be stated as follows: H6. Diversity and inclusion in workplace engagement mediate the relationship between a supportive work environment and employee retention during COVID-19.  2.6 Conceptual Framework  As illustrated in Figure 1, the conceptual frameworks are adopted from various theoretical frameworks and several research studies as described above. In this framework, the authors aim to study the factors (supportive work environment in perceived working climate, supervisory relationship, peer group interaction, perceived organizational support, diversity, and inclusion in the workplace engagement) that influence employee retention during COVID-19, as shown in Figure 1.                   3. Research methodology  3.1 Population and Sample Size  Representatives of research groups from public and private organizations for the manufacturing and service industries across the country. The population used in this study was working age groups who faced work difficulties amid the COVID-19 pandemic. For the sampling method to select representatives, the specific sample selection method is used. Initial data from 260 respondents from 67 organizations were collected and analyzed. The sample distribution can be seen in Table 1. Table 1 shows that a total of 260 respondents participated in the study by filling out the questionnaires. More than half of the participants (76.2 percent) were Non-HR. Only 23.8 percent were HR employees. Out of the total participants, 89.2 percent were male, and 10.8 percent were female. More than half of these respondents (71.9  136                                    Nachayapat Rodprayoon, Stanislaw Paul Maj / AU-GSB e-Journal Vol 14 No 2 (2021) 130-143  percent) were working for private organizations. Only 28.1 percent were from public organizations. Considering the industry, 65.0 percent of participants were from service industries, whereas 35.0 percent were from manufacturing industries. Further, 32.7 percent of respondents were multinational companies' employees, and 67.3 percent respondents were from local (Thai) companies; 16.5 percent of respondents were aged less than 25 years, 43.5 percent were aged between 26 and 40, 23.5 percent were aged between 41 and 60, and 16.5 percent were aged above 60 years.

First, the item objective congruence (IOC) has been reviewed by three experts who qualified master's degree in service industries and multinational companies in Thailand. The communication with the experts has been conducted thru instant messaging like Line App and Facebook messenger. After receiving the three expert's feedback referring to \"incongruent= -1\", \"doubt/not sure=0\", and \"congruent=1\", then the researchers revised the questions in the questionnaire until the mean score of each question reached a minimum of 0.67. As for the liability test, the researchers conducted a pilot study with a simple random of 50 respondents. The researcher uses Cronbach's Alpha to test the reliability of each variable.

H1, H2, H3, and H4 were supported (H1, p-value .003), (H2, H4, p-value < .000) and (H3, p-value .030), which indicate that perceived Nachayapat Rodprayoon, Stanislaw Paul Maj / AU-GSB e-Journal Vol 14 No 2 (2021) 130-143                                               139  working climate (PWC), supervisory relationship (SR), peer group interaction (PGI), and perceived organizational support (POS) have a positive effect on the diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement (DIW). Therefore, H1, H2, H3, and H4 have VIFs values lower than 5, meaning that there was no multicollinearity problem.

The analysis results are demonstrated in table 5, employee retention during COVID-19 (EMR) of workplace diversity for 29.1% at 95% confidence level as shown by R-square value of .291. Diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement (H5) and perceived organizational support (H6) were supported because the p-values were below 0.05 for every independent variable. As diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement (H5) and perceived organizational support (H6) was supported, they had a significant effect on employee retention during COVID-19 (EMR) regarding workplace diversity in organizations. Diversity and inclusion in workplace engagement have the most impact among the two variables, showing the standardized Coefficient of .407. Perceived organizational support (POS) has the standardized Coefficient of .174, which indicates that diversity and inclusion in workplace engagement have superior influence than Perceived organizational support over employee retention during COVID-19 in the workplace diversity in organizations.

Therefore, the level of the strengths of influence was ranked and summarized in Table 6. The ranking of the variables from the most substantial influence to less substantial influence of independent variables toward diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement. The Beta has applied the level of influence from the variables. The highest substantial influence is the supervisory relationship (SR) .642, following by Perceived organizational support (POS) .170, perceived working climate (PWC) .115, and peer group interaction (PGI) .011. Moreover, testing the hypotheses of the significant influence of the independent variables in diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement and perceived organizational support toward employee retention during COVID-19 by multiple linear regression (MLR) was also revealed in table 6. The highest substantial influence is diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement (DIW) .407 and perceived organizational support (POS) .174.  Table 6.

Supervisory relationship, perceived organizational support, perceived working climate, and peer group interaction are key factors respectively strength rankings that are relevant to workplace diversity and inclusion in the organization. Glen (2006) and 140                                    Nachayapat Rodprayoon, Stanislaw Paul Maj / AU-GSB e-Journal Vol 14 No 2 (2021) 130-143  Joo and Mclean (2006) perceptively pointed out that a supportive work environment and diversity and inclusion in the workplace are key strategies for retaining people in an organization. Engaged employees provide a competitive advantage with workplace diversity and inclusion. For this reason, organizations need to continually contribute to achieve strategic goals and deliver important business results. Diversity and inclusion in an engaged workplace, it has a greater impact on corporate commitment and brings good business results. Shuck et al. (2010) have drawn attention to the fact that coworker relationship Governance relationship Organizational policies and procedures A supportive work atmosphere and workplace environment are key components of a positive work environment that promotes employee engagement. Moreover, workplace diversity and inclusion predominately outweigh the perceived organizational support for employee retention during COVID-19 in terms of diversity in the workplace in the organization correctly argues that Richman et al. (2008), Osteraker (1999), and Knippenberg (2000) there was a consensus that when employees identify with a group and contribute to the group's performance, they become more loyal and stay in the organization. To add to it, employee engagement is driven by emotional commitment, but corporate involvement is separate from commitment.   5. Conclusion and Recommendation   5.1 Conclusion  Research makes it evident that diversity and participation in the workplace are important and be consistent with the support of the organization. In this regard, the foundation of participation arises from the work patterns, policies, and work culture of the organization that will create participation in the work environment, relationships, and interactions at work. This is one of the valuable assets of the organization as businesses still rely on human resources is key to the operation. However, the influence of workplace diversity on employee retention during COVID-19 requires a human resource management strategy. This requires an analysis of situations and trends affecting employee retention in both external and internal business environments. To carry out effective human resource management and affect the performance of the organization. Especially during the epidemic situation of the COVID-19 virus that affects the competitiveness and working environment. The organizations were focusing on employee engagement strategies. But the intrusion of COVID-19 caused emasculated engagement strategies as organizations were more anxious about their survival. The organizations were focusing on employee engagement strategies. Due to the epidemic situation of the COVID-19, a variety of strategic management needs to be managed both in terms of working environment governance relationship policies and procedures for operating the organization including the involvement of employees that need to support.  The stressful situation caused psychological pressure amongst workers leading to declining engagement levels. Fear of loss of job during COVID-19 was the key driving force behind employee engagement. The organization must learn and manage a work environment that supports diversity to create employee participation.  Including creating a working atmosphere for interaction among friends to strengthen the work system.  To focusing on a variety of different factors. The suggested by the authors, an organization can ponder upon the level of employee engagement and enhance its quantity as well as quality. These elements are perpetual and can never lose their sheen even in a crisis like COVID-19 or pandemic. Also, Kumar (2021) has the same results in this study he pointed out that an organization is a product of joint efforts and diligence of their employees and ensuring their financial and medical facilities during or after pandemic can significantly enhance their engagement level.  5.2 Recommendation  The study used only the diversity and participation data in the workplace for content analysis. This may cause some and therefore, limited empirical studies are available. Additionally, the investigators recommend qualitative or mixed studies related to this topic in the future.  Organizations are planning to develop a path forward after the COVID-19 outbreak, with recommendations to recognize and identify loneliness in the workplace as a COVID-19 indicator. including the well-being of employees in HR policies, programs, and practices. Closely study innovation at people started taking action within weeks of the compulsory shutdown. It will be useful to inform future practice. as well as finding ways to prevent loneliness and increase resilience. Such investigations will complement the latest work that focuses on developing resilience through experimentation and research.   References   Agarwal, I. (2016).

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to identify the factors influencing workplace diversity on employee retention in organizations during the COVID-19. In this study, the researchers aim to determine which factors will be the most effect on workplace diversity on employee retention in organizations during the COVID-19 variables in this study consisting of Supervisory relationship, perceived organizational support, perceived working climate, peer group interaction, diversity, and inclusion in the workplace engagement, and perceived organizational support. A total of 260 participants, which contain specific characteristics such as designation in human resource and non-human resource, gender, industry sectors, nature of industry, ownership, and age range. Both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were used in data analysis such as frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and multiple linear regression (MLR) to describe the demographic profile and the causal relationship between variables. In this study, results revealed that perceived working climate (PWC), supervisory relationship (SR), peer group interaction (PGI), and perceived organizational support (POS) have a positive significant effect on diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement (DIW) at a p-value less than .05, also, diversity and inclusion in the workplace engagement (DIW) and perceived organizational support (POS) have a positive significant effect on employee retention during COVID-19 which all hypotheses support the null hypothesis",
