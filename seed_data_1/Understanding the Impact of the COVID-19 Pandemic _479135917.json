A combination of nonparametric and longitudinal analysis is performed to evaluate the impacts of the transition to a virtual educational environment and the stressors brought on by the global pandemic. Additional qualitative evaluation is performed to gain insight and make program recommendations to enhance the resilience of individuals in the academic systems. Results demonstrate a large shift in circumstances immediately at the start of the pandemic, with a variety of significant trends across the survey cycles and topics. A comparison of the two institutions both qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate how different institutional responses and student bodies impacted the overall student experience.     iv ACKNOWLEDGMENTS   Special thanks to Dr. Tali Freed, Dr. Lizabeth L.

Introduction  Resilience is defined by the National Academies as âthe ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse eventsâ (Council, 2012). Typically, adverse events relate to natural disasters: tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, or anything that disrupts infrastructure via physical destruction. To examine and develop resilience in these cases of natural disasters is a well-documented field; it requires communities to invest in resilience by identifying unique risks and building resilience via preparation and risk management infrastructure. Thus, resilience is not observed at the single point of an adverse event, it is the examination of how a community prepares and recovers over time as well as the tools available to utilize in recovery. However, examining this concept of building and evaluating resilience in the context of higher education is not often possible, particularly within a world-wide crisis. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has thoroughly disrupted higher education communities across the world. These communities are facing a significant adverse event: a pandemic that has imposed restrictive learning and living conditions for students, staff, and faculty. This provides an opportunity to examine how resilience built prior and during this pandemic is impacted by both internal and external factors across a myriad of diverse populations, as well as explore how universities can intervene and assist students during challenging conditions that may disproportionately impact them.  The students from the College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology at California State Los Angeles (Cal State LA) and the College of Engineering at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) were continuously surveyed throughout the first year of the crisis to quantitively and qualitatively evaluate the shifts in studentsâ experiences with respect to seven key factors: overall stress, remote instruction   2 effectiveness, access to computer resource, financial stressors, family obligations impact, instructor flexibility, and academic engagement. With survey data from both institutions, longitudinal and nonparametric analysis is utilized to evaluate how factors specific to each institutionâs pandemic response impact their studentâs experience, additionally allowing a look into how quickly community resilience assisted in overall recovery. Evaluating each universityâs strong response characteristics and benchmarking them with generic strategies to enhance resilience shall allow the discussion of appropriate response tactics during future crises.    3 II. Background  With the recent shift of the university system in March of 2020 to primarily virtual classes and educational interactions, it is important to understand the additional difficulties that are generated. Previous studies on virtual learning have yielded student narratives of both negatives and positives to this teaching style. The flexibility, reduced travel cost, and potentially reduced time requirements are attractive. However, negatives such as lower motivation, impacted time management skills, inability to interpret othersâ attitudes, reduced real time communications, and shortened subject intake periods are all potential difficulties when entering a virtual learning environment (Sarah, Stone, & Delahunty, 2015). These additional difficulties are generic, and do not account for any additional risks for students with lower financial standing or lack of resources. Uncertainties have certainly risen higher as most universities were not fully prepared to shift into a virtual environment, bringing into question how universities can or should respond to enhance studentsâ resilience going forward.  Enhancing resilience within an academic setting is not a new idea, however when applied to academic settings it inherently overlaps with the concept of persistence: âheightened likelihood of success in school and other life accomplishments despite environmental adversitiesâ  (Carnell, Hunsu, Ray, & Sochacka, 2018). Academic persistence is impacted by both internal and external factors, with a complex interaction between oneâs attributes and their environment. Internal factors can be personal strengths that prove to be assets to persistence. This includes traits such as adaptability, self-sufficiency, self-control, optimism, persistence, and cooperative communication (Hanson & Kim, 2007). Building these traits via programs or mentorships within academic communities is an example of building community resilience while also ideally increasing potential academic persistence. Often measuring these traits can be a   4 fairly qualitative process, but commonly surveys inquiring an individual with targeted questions allows researchers to begin a personalized evaluation for research participants. An example of this is the Psychometric Project Resilience Scale (PPRS), which requires individuals to complete a fifty-statement test with a 5-point Likert scale on the accuracy of the statements. These statements target five traits: adaptability, self-control, self-sufficiency, optimism, and persistence (Carnell, Hunsu, Ray, & Sochacka, 2018). External factors are attributes that contribute to the environment surrounding the individual. In the academic setting this includes family relationships, home environment, support system, support for education, financial situation, and the resources of the education institution (Torres & Solberg, 2001)(Williams, 2014).  Another method of defining resilience includes concepts of risk factors and protective factors (Williams, 2014). Risk factors are defined as characteristics or conditions of a group or individual that increases the likelihood of undesirable outcomes (Williams, 2014). This may include factors such as financial standing, housing security, or mental health conditions. Protective factors are essentially the blend of positive internal and external factors, which allow the individual or group to defy the effects of risk factors. Essentially, protective factors are enhanced when resilience is built within community infrastructures, for example academic support groups, counseling, or housing support.  In this current study the survey responses incoming from two distinctly different universities allows a unique blend of risk and protective factors to be considered.  The generated survey was developed by Dr. Lizabeth Thompson of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Dr. Tonatiuh Rodriguez-Nikl of Cal State Los Angeles with input from others at Cal State Los Angeles. Refer to Appendix A for the complete survey questions for both institutions. After approval from the Institutional Research board, the survey was administered via a Qualtrics online survey tool, with   5 quantitative responses typically measured with a slider between 0 and 100. The survey administrations occurred on the start dates outlined in Table 1: Table 1. School Cycle Dates  Time Cycle CSULA CPSLO Spring Quarter/Semester 1 4/15 4/21 Spring Quarter/Semester 2 4/29 5/6 Spring Quarter/End of Semester 3 5/13 5/18 End of Quarter 4 5/28 6/1 Summer 5 6/12 6/22 Summer 6 6/25 N/A  Survey responses were collected throughout each cycle session, with the new cycle session beginning at the dates listed above. A subset of the Cal Poly SLO student survey is sampled in  Table 2. The Cal State LA survey was similar with only references to college and university by name or specific Learning Management System changed. First time respondents provided responses based on their circumstances both before and after the onset of the pandemic. Repeat respondents provided updates on circumstances over several cycles, generating a unique longitudinal ID via survey questions to ensure repeat respondents were tracked. Since the survey has been administered over the course of several months, longitudinal analysis may be performed on the quantitative data.    With these techniques on hand, the follow research questions are investigated: 1. Generally, how has the pandemic impacted students in an academic setting? 2. Does this impact or overall experience vary depending on specific factors, such as university conditions or socio-economic status? 3. Did different university interventions mitigate the impact of these kinds of adverse events differently?    6 Table 2.

Yes/No 15 Rate the average effectiveness of remote instruction over the last week. 0-100 16 How flexible were your instructors on average over the last week? 0-100 17 Rate your average level of engagement in your classes over the last week. 0-100 18 How many of your professors used Canvas or Polylearn to post information and/or communicate over the last week? 0-100 19 How many of your professors used Zoom to deliver content while you listened (synchronous instruction) over the last week? 0-100 20 How many of your professors used pre-recorded videos or reading materials to deliver content (asynchronous instruction) over the last week? 0-100  Note that the twelfth question initially had a range of 0 to 100 on the interval rating scale during CSULA and CPSLOâs first survey administration, but this was shifted to -100 to 100 for both institutions for all other cycles.    7 III.  Literature Review  A topics visualization (Figure 1) indicated the key topics and sub-topics that contribute to understanding the problem as well as generate data-driven solutions.   Figure 1. Literature Review Topics Visualization  Key topics include longitudinal analysis and enhancing resilience within the context of an academic environment.   Longitudinal Analysis  Longitudinal analysis is utilized for observational studies where data is obtained from sampling individuals over time without interfering with the subjects (Newsom, Jones, & Hofer, 2012) (Institute for Work & Health, 2015). This allows researchers to detect changes in characteristics of a targeted population at both the individual and group level. Longitudinal data can be gathered in a variety of ways, each with their own recommended types of statistical analysis. âPanel surveysâ are used when the same individuals are interviewed over the course of defined time points (UK Data Service, 2015). This is also known as cross-sectional time-series data. Data from panel surveys can reveal underlying factors that change as well as allow the researcher to control factors during analysis. The United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research is an application of panel surveys (UK Data Service, 2015). This study has utilized panel surveys since 2009 to examine   8 the social and economic changes in Britain at both the household and individual level. The target of this study is to develop policy interventions to enhance the general wellbeing of the UK population.  Similar to panel surveys, cohort surveys target the same individuals over time, but the individuals begin the surveys at an identical point of their life. Two studies, the Nursesâ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, are both cohort studies seeking to quantify overall cancer risks with respect to alcohol consumption among men and women (Cao, Willett, Rimm, Stampfer, & Giovannucci, 2015). Cohort studies specifically allow researchers to also account for underlying individual changes specifically as people age or live through certain historical contexts. The final type of longitudinal survey data is retrospective longitudinal survey data, which inquires with respondents about past events in their life. Often this retrospective aspect is coupled with panel surveys since the individualâs ability to recall is typically less reliable (UK Data Service, 2015).  Longitudinal survey data typically has inherent biases: non-response bias and response error bias (UK Data Service, 2015). Non-response bias is defined as individuals from an assortment of backgrounds dropping out between survey waves or administrations. This causes attrition or unbalanced panels, which may require generation of weights to compensate for the loss of data. As in all surveys there is response error bias, which occurs when study participants provide incorrect answers due to misinterpreting the questions. Additional bias stems from risks behind panel surveys, such as any changes in question wording or sampling strategies, which impact how questions are interpreted and who is receiving the survey.  Analyzing longitudinal data requires clear assumption selection as well as careful data manipulation. The UK Data Service generally advises checking for missing data and generating   9 weights to minimize bias and improve the estimation representation in any analysis. Careful consideration of missing data is important in longitudinal analysis. There are âThree Types of Missingnessâ as identified by Rubin: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not random (MNAR) (Newsom, Jones, & Hofer, 2012). MCAR is traditionally assumed by most statistical packages, however, many packages default to listwise deletion, which only uses data with fully response responses at each wave. This is not ideal for longitudinal studies, where respondents may enter and exit throughout the survey waves. Another technique for replacing missing values is single imputation, which uses methods such as unconditional mean imputation and regression imputation to replace missing data. The more modern technique is multiple imputation, which replaces missing values with a âset of plausible values to represent random errors in the imputation processâ (Newsom, Jones, & Hofer, 2012).  Similar to the UK Data Service, Newsom provides basic longitudinal analysis approaches. Graphic exploration of the data at two time points can illustrate relationships, identify outliers, and evaluate individual variation (Newsom, Jones, & Hofer, 2012). Repeated-measures t-tests or otherwise ANOVA âwithin-subjectsâ tests are commonly used since they remove individual differences from analysis, as compared to between-subjects tests, which do not. Using repeated-measures ANOVA with longitudinal data has as many levels as time points, as each comparison is between the means of two or more time points. Repeated-measures ANOVA assumes sphericity: the assumption of equal variances; compound symmetry: the equal covariances among different values; and nonadditivity: a statistical interaction between the time and subject factor. If the sphericity assumption is violated, MANOVA is another possible statistical technique. Within the context of longitudinal studies, the multiple measures can be used where there are repeated survey time point responses. It is suggested to use MANOVA if   10 âthe number of levels are between 5 and 8 and the sample size is greater than the number of levels plus 30â (Newsom, Jones, & Hofer, 2012). The most common MANOVA model featured in software packages is Wilkâs lambda approach.  Since ANOVA requires normality of residuals, several nonparametric tests may be appropriate to analyze basic changes in the population across time points.  For two groups, a Mann-Whitney test allows the comparison of medians to determine if they are significantly different between groups. This does not require the assumption of normally distributed residuals; however, it does require the two groups to be made up of independent observations. Kruskal-Wallis is a continuation of Mann-Whitney, allowing more than two groups within the comparison. This analysis requires ordinal scale, ratio scale, or interval scale dependent variables (Statistics How To, n.d.). Friedmanâs test is another nonparametric test seeking to find a difference in treatments across multiple points. This test does not require a normal distribution, however it does require ordinal or continuous data, as well as each independentâs observation measured at least three different times, making it inherently impractical for longitudinal studies with primarily one-time respondents.   ANOVA and nonparametric analysis primarily focus on determining if factors are significantly impacting variation of the dependent variable. To determine significant trends particularly across subgroups, typically generated regression models allow researchers to determine if different levels of a factor serve to significantly impact a trend of the dependent variable. The simplest method of analysis is fitting regression models or trend lines to scatter plots of unique continuous variables. This allows identification of trends between and across waves of the data using the ANOVA family of models. Additional modeling techniques include event history analysis, also known as survival analysis or duration analysis, which allows   11 researchers to develop causal models for occurrence of events. Change score regression is another technique, which regresses the difference of two continuous outcomes at two waves with person level covariates. Lagged regression is similar, with regression of outcome against covariate including the outcome of interest previously. Finally, multilevel models are another technique, and can describe pattern of change over time, estimate difference in direction between persons, assess the impact of covariates, and determine if change in circumstances over time will impact the personâs change.  It is important to note that many of the listed techniques require assumptions of normality.  If typical statistical assumptions are not met, specifically normality and equal variances, general estimation equations (GEE) is a plausible longitudinal model method. Close to GLM, GEE is a nonparametric model fitting that aims to average the response over a population using an assumed within-subject covariance structure (Hong & Ottoboni, 2017). The primary assumptions of GEE include responses being correlated or clustered, a linear relationship between covariates and response, and a present within-subject covariance structure.  Response variables can be categorical or continuous, with a variety of distributions available within the model such as gaussian, binomial, and Poisson (Columbia Public Health, n.d.). The first step of GEE is specifying these distributions to represent the closest match to the response data. For example, a binomial distribution can be used for a binary response, while Poisson can be used with count data.  The second step of GEE is specifying the correlation structure of the response variable (Ballinger, 2004). Four main options exist: independent, exchangeable, autoregressive, and unstructured. Independent covariance assumes that all responses within subject are independent. Exchangeable covariance assumes that all observations over time have the same correlation and is typically used when there is no logical ordering for observations, meaning data   12 may not be collected over time. Autoregressive covariance specifies that data is correlated within cluster over time, with the correlation decreasing with more time between observations.  Unstructured covariance is a free estimation which assumes correlation across all time may be different and attempts to estimate all correlations between within-subject responses. Specifying a covariance structure incorrectly can be balanced by using a âsandwich estimatorâ to âuse empirical residuals to approximate the underlying covarianceâ (Hong & Ottoboni, 2017). However, this is not advised if the response is unbalanced, with the number of repeated measures differing across the individuals. With the response distribution and covariance structure inputted, GEE outputs regression coefficients that can be tested for significance in a similar manner to ANOVA. The one downside of GEE is there is no widely accepted goodness-of-fit statistic, which forces the analyst to be cautious with their inputs and results (Ballinger, 2004).   Enhancing Resilience  Karpâs âToward a New Understanding of Non-Academic Student Supportâ is one of the most commonly cited sources for any persistence programs developed for enhancing resilience since 2011. The original intent of the paper was to address low rates of student persistence in community colleges, citing how students entering postsecondary education must develop and adapt to new expectations, interpersonal relationships, and bureaucratic requirements which requires resilience development (Karp, 2011). Examining previous studies or theories behind student persistence revealed Karpâs four mechanisms for student persistence.  Karpâs first mechanism is creating social relationships, which is the concept that students with secure interactions with both professors and classmates will create a sense of belonging as well as provide additional information to contribute positively to the studentâs persistence. Development of these social relationships for off-campus students are increasingly difficult,   13 where the external factors surrounding the student creates competing needs of time and energy, detracting from time and energy poured into higher education relationships (Karp, 2011). Karpâs second mechanism is âclarifying aspirations and enhancing commitment.â This mechanism is primarily a function of any activity that assists students in developing clear academic goals. The third mechanism is âdeveloping college know-hows,â which more specifically focuses on providing information on strategies for academic success and college navigation. Some examples of this are information on study techniques, job applications, and general usage of student services. Finally, the fourth mechanism is âmaking college life feasible,â a mechanism focused on meeting the needs stemming from a studentâs negative internal and external factors, including financial situation, mental health, or home life.   There are many programs designed to increase persistence while developing resilience infrastructure for students, especially for those with high risk factors and lower protective factors. Generically, some typical solutions include first-year seminars, learning communities, orientation programs, and early warning systems (Rockey & Congleton, 2016). Elements of Karpâs four mechanisms are evident in these solutions, especially in first-year seminars, which have been found to increase retention rates (Rockey & Congleton, 2016). Additionally, the concept of intrusive advising is common, this being traditional advising with required attendance from the students (Karp, 2011).   Specific programs focused on higher risk demographics across many universities also reveal techniques specific to enhancing academic resilience. The Dell Scholars Program is a United States based program that seeks âto address all the emotional, lifestyle, and financial challenges that may prevent scholars from completing collegeâ (Page, Kehoe, Castleman, & Sahadewo, 2019). The program begins with high school applicants who provide a range of   14 information to reveal the internal and external factors specific to their adversities, with specific requirements such as a minimum GPA of 2.4 and participation in a college-readiness program. Once selected, students are provided typical scholarship amenities, such as $20,000, a laptop, and textbooks. However, the program also provides intrusive advising, which is enforced via a web-based platform developed by the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation. This platform requires scholars to report information about their academic status, financial struggles, emotional well-being and more, which in turn allows the scholarship program team to identify at-risk students and provide follow-up assistance. To evaluate the effectiveness of this system, researchers compared scholar finalists with scholar recipients. Comparing a cohort group between 2009 and 2012 demonstrated that scholar recipients are 6 to 10 percent more likely to receive a bachelorâs degree in four years, and 9 to 13 percent more likely within six years. Incorporating this program at less selective institutions had an increased persistence impact, which is hypothesized to be the cause of adding additional support and resources to institutions with less institutional resources and lower per-student spending (Bound, Lovenheim, & Turner, 2010). Additionally, the Dell program yielded higher GPAs, less financial borrowing, and more continuous and successful college credits.   Another influential program designed to enhance resilience is the Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) for CUNY community colleges. This program was proposed by the governor with an intention to increase the three-year associate degree completion rate to above 50% (Kolenovic, Linderman, & Karm, 2013). To do so, the program was developed to focus on three interrelated constructs: maintaining academic momentum, sense of belonging, and ability to access support services. A dedicated staff are available for participants for personalized advisement as well as career development services. Additionally, participants are required to   15 attend advising sessions twice a month, echoing the intrusive support concept from other programs. A recent study compared 1132 ASAP participants with 1791 non-ASAP participants, and found that 55% of ASAP students earned a degree after three years, substantially larger than the 25% non-ASAP students (Kolenovic, Linderman, & Karm, 2013).   Additional programs are university specific, with emphasis on supporting individuals from underrepresented groups. For example, the Meyerhoff Scholars Program at the University of Maryland utilizes research experiences, orientations, and financial support to increase the persistence of African American students.  Another program at Harvey Mudd has shifted the number of female computer science students from 12% to 40% in five years by introducing students to female computer scientists (Ikuma, Steele, Dann, Adio, & Waggenspack Jr, 2019).   There are many programs designed to enhance resilience, but it is important to note that the creation of these programs does not guarantee results. As Karp reflects repeatedly, the actual effort to âimprove persistence should focus on processes, not programsâ (Karp, 2011). Karp has a few recommendations on this front. Redesigning advising and counseling to be thoroughly accessible, with potential for using technology to create efficiency and an interactive advising interface. Additionally, blending intrusive advising in both formal and informal situations is recommended, especially after utilizing an early warning system. Within the context of a virtual school environment, this begs the question of how these ideas can be implemented efficiently and effectively for all students. However, shifting many of the consistent tactics within these programs to a virtual system is plausible, as seen with the Dell programâs web-based platform.      16 IV.  Methods  Once data was received from Dr. Tonatiuh Rodriguez-Nikl (Cal State LA) and Dr. Lizabeth Thompson (Cal Poly), the general analysis process was followed:  Figure 2. Longitudinal Analysis Process  Although data was collected for students, faculty, and staff at the two universities, this first analysis only considered the data generated by students.  Survey data was cleaned by synchronizing the columns for the CSULA and CPSLO datasets via MATLAB (see Appendix B for the working code). For determining response characteristics, responses were separated by school, response topic, and timing of survey administration. There were seven student response topics: access to computer resources, instruction effectiveness, academic engagement, impact of family obligations, financial stressors, instructor flexibility, and overall stress. The first time the survey was administered the responder was assigned questions that required responses for both the previous two weeks as well as pre-pandemic circumstances. Respondents were asked about the pre-pandemic circumstances only during their first administration of the survey. This data is referred to as âCycle 0â and was generated across all cycles since any first-time respondents   17 were assigned pre-pandemic questions. This pre-pandemic portion of the survey requires consideration of recall bias for first time respondents entering at later cycles and rating their circumstances before the pandemic many months later. This potential bias will be addressed in the first stages of analysis. Since the response data is distinctly broken up into before (Cycle 0) and after (Cycles 1-6) data, three analysis avenues are pursued. First, comparing Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 data to determine if the onset of virtual instruction and pandemic significantly impacted each schoolâs general population, as well as certain ethnicity groups. Second, comparing the variation of each survey topic across cycles with multiple factors considered to determine if certain subgroups experienced vastly different changes in circumstances, as well as determining if these differences over cycles have a strong trend. Third, comparing each cycleâs survey topic ratings between the schools to determine if the differences in school interventions or general school conditions impacted the student perception of their own circumstances. Visually this is represented in Figure 3.   Figure 3. Analysis Graphical Representation   18 To determine what analysis techniques to use, the dataset was checked for the assumptions of normality and equal variances. Due to the interval characteristics (ranging 0-100) of the responses, normality of both the before and after responses failed consistently due to the extremes of the scales being heavily populated. Transformation of the data did not yield normality; thus, analysis must be nonparametric. Testing for equal variances with Leveneâs test revealed that a majority of the topics had equal variances, but a few topics validated this assumption (primarily the stress topic).  Refer to Table 24 and Table 25 for the P-values of normality testing and Leveneâs test for equal variances. We assume missing completely at random since missing values did not have any consistent trends and statistical programs typically assume MCAR. For respondents over the six survey administrations, 1746 out of 2961 responses have a uniquely generated longitudinal ID. The uniquely generated longitudinal ID was created each time the respondent took the survey and answered a few generic questions yielding (see the appendix for complete surveys) answers that were combined to create a unique string. To identify if a respondent returned for multiple cycles of survey administration a consistent unique ID had to be generated by the respondent.    Figure 4. Returning Respondents Analysis  Visualizing the number of users that returned for multiple cycles in Figure 4, it is evident that many individuals took the survey one time as opposed to returning for multiple cycles. The Cycle Number Number of Individuals   19 responses with no unique longitudinal identifier were treated as a single-time responder. Thus, although there are evenly spaced cycle intervals, there is no balance in number of respondents across cycles. Additionally, this indicates that there is a mixture of independent and dependent responses across cycles, which will violate any statistical techniques with assumption of independence.   V.    Results  For ease of interpretation, a topic summary table is useful for evaluating the actual meaning of numbers from analysis. As seen in Table 3, the green highlighted boxes indicate the ideal end of the response intervals. If a respondent rating is closer to the ideal end of the intervals, this indicates more desirable circumstances. For example, scoring high on the interval for access to computer resources is more ideal than scoring on the âterribleâ end of the interval.  Table 3. Survey Topics Overview  Topic Lower Response Interval Higher Access to Computer Resources Terrible 0-100 Great Instruction Effectiveness Ineffective 0-100 Effective Academic Engagement Unengaged 0-100 Engaged Family Obligations Impact Negative -100-100 Positive Instructor Flexibility Inflexible 0-100 Flexible Financial Stressors No Impact 0-100 Big Impact Overall Stress Unstressed 0-100 Stressed  Cycles 0 & 1 Comparison   Cycle 0 data refers to the survey topic interval ratings provided by respondents when asked about before pandemic conditions. Thus, Cycle 0 data can come from any cycles assuming the respondent is a first-time respondent. Since Cycle 0 was collected across time, there is a   20 potential issue with recall bias, which would represent an increasingly biased perception of prior circumstances as time goes on. Prior to investigating the potential shift in response variables between Cycle 0 and Cycle 1, the Cycle 0 data must be tested to understand if there is potentially recall bias present across the cycles. Since the data was nonparametric across all the survey topics and all before responses should be unique and independent, Kruskal-Wallis was selected to check if the before-pandemic responses shifted significantly across the cycles.  Table 4. Before Data Cycle Comparison  School Topic Kruskal-Wallis LA Computer Resources 0.9 LA Effectiveness 0.418 LA Engagement 0.113 LA Family Obligations 0.047 LA Finances 0.035 LA Flexibility 0.909 LA Stress 0.354 SLO Computer Resources 0.594 SLO Effectiveness 0.236 SLO Engagement 0.017 SLO Family Obligations 0.906 SLO Finances 0.735 SLO Flexibility 0.436 SLO Stress 0.047  As seen in Table 4, the Kruskal-Wallis P-values were significant in several topics, indicating that there was a statistically significant change in the medians of the Cycle 0 data as individuals responded later in time. This represents a chance for recall bias that could potentially blur any significance in the immediate change in student conditions before and after the pandemic forced virtual instruction. Since the highest percentage of new respondents across cycles stem from Cycle 1 (530 new respondents out of 1234 total first time respondents across cycles), going forward it will be assumed that only the Cycle 0 data from the first survey (or Cycle 1) can be   21 utilized to examine a potential shift in the survey topics from before and after the onset of the pandemic.   To determine if there was a shift in circumstances according to the before and after pandemic interval results from Cycle 1, a Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was performed for each survey topic. The Wilcoxon signed-ranked test operates as a nonparametric version of a paired sample t-test. This is valid for this case since respondents in the Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 comparison were not independent and also not normally distributed. Results in this case indicate if the medians of the response topics were not within the same interval based on respondent perception of before and after the onset of the pandemic immediately when the first survey was issued.  Table 5. Cycle 0 and 1 Wilcoxon Signed-Ranked Test Summary Table  School Topic P-Value Higher is Positive Conclusion LA Computer Resources 1.23 E-05 Yes Computer resources decreased significantly. LA Effectiveness 2.49 E-26 Yes Effectiveness decreased significantly. LA Engagement 1.49 E-24 Yes Engagement decreased significantly. LA Family Obligations 0.925 Yes Change not significant.

SLO Computer Resources 3.06 E-12 Yes Computer resources decreased significantly. SLO Effectiveness 5.58 E-50 Yes Effectiveness decreased significantly. SLO Engagement 5.93 E-42 Yes Engagement decreased significantly. SLO Family Obligations 0.0623 Yes Change is not significant.  SLO Finances 2.26 E-16 No Finance stress increased significantly. SLO Flexibility 1.4 E-11 Yes Flexibility increased significantly. SLO Stress 7.41 E-13 No Stress decreased significantly.  Table 5 illustrates the results of the one-sided Wilcoxon signed-ranked test. Both the CPSLO and CSULA access to computer resources medians shifted significantly, indicating that the access to computer resources fell initially. Instruction effectiveness and academic engagement also proved   22 to be significantly impacted at both institutions, showing that the effectiveness of instruction and academic engagement of students decreased once virtual classes were enacted. Family obligations is the only response variable that did not test a significantly different median before and after the switch to online schooling. Concern about finances for students are significant at both institutions, allowing the conclusion that students faced more financial stressors in Cycle 1. Instructor flexibility is significantly different for CPSLO, indicating with the one-sided test that CPSLO decreased instructor flexibility during the virtual quarter while CSULA significantly increased instructor flexibility. The final response variable stress is significant at both institutions, indicating that stress increased for students after the onset of the pandemic. As seen in Figure 5, these conclusions were visually evaluated using subject-connected scatterplots with built-in boxplots. The other Cycle 0 to Cycle 1 plots reside in Appendix E.   Figure 5. Effectiveness Cycle 0 and 1 Scatterplots    23  To explore if different ethnicity subgroups were impacted significantly, the one-sided Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was also performed with ethnicity groups containing five or more respondents, a requirement of the Wilcoxon test itself (NCSS). For Cal State LA this eliminated demographic Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 analysis for the African American, American Indian, Pacific Islander, and Decline to State ethnicity groups.  Table 6.

On the contrary, the yellow-highlighted p-values indicate a significant increase in the Cycle 0 median to Cycle 1 median. For the Asian subgroup (30 â 38 individuals), there is a significant drop in computer resources, instruction effectiveness, and academic engagement, as well as a significant increase in the financial stressor and overall stress medians. All of these significance values indicate a negative change in circumstances for the Asian subgroup, with impact of family obligations and instructor flexibility not changing significantly. The Hispanic subgroup (102 â 115 individuals) displays a significant drop in the medians for access to computer resources, instruction effectiveness, academic engagement, and perceived instructor flexibility. Financial   24 stressors and overall stress medians are also significantly higher in Cycle 1.Once again, none of these shifts are positive with respective to the student perceived circumstances. Due to small sample sizes for the Multiple Ethnicities, White, and other subgroups, results are less dependable. However, the overall stress median for Cycle 1 is significantly higher than Cycle 0 for all three subgroups. The Multiple Ethnicities group appeared to experience a slightly different shift in circumstances. Unlike the other subgroups, the Multiple Ethnicities group did not experience a significantly lower academic engagement median in Cycle 1. Additionally, the Cycle 1 instructor flexibility median is significantly higher, the only positive shift in circumstance for any subgroup within the Cal State La Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 demographic analysis.  Table 7.

The p-values for the other subgroups are outlined in Table 7. For the Asian subgroup (50 â 53 individuals) and Hispanic subgroup (22 â 24 individuals), the Cycle 1 median for access to computer resources, instruction effectiveness, and academic engagement all were   25 significantly lower than the Cycle 0 median. Financial stressors as well as overall stress yielded a significantly higher Cycle 1 median as compared to Cycle 0, meaning no helpful shifts in circumstances were perceived by these two subgroups. Itâs interesting to note that these significant perceived changes for the Asian subgroup matched at both Cal Poly SLO and Cal State LA. The Multiple Ethnicities subgroup (23 â 29 individuals) demonstrated a significantly lower Cycle 1 median for instruction effectiveness and academic engagement, as well as a significantly higher Cycle 1 median for financial stressors and instructor flexibility when compared to Cycle 0. In this case, only the change in instructor flexibility is a helpful shift after the shift to virtual instruction. The White subgroup (172 â 199 individuals) had a significantly lower Cycle 1 median for access to computer resources, instruction effectiveness, and academic engagement, all negative changes. In addition to that, the White subgroup has a significantly higher Cycle 1 median for financial stressors and overall stress, however, they also have a significantly higher Cycle 1 instructor flexibility median, a helpful change. The Decline to State subgroup yielded a significantly lower Cycle 1 median for instruction effectiveness as well as a significantly higher Cycle 1 median for overall stress, both negative changes in circumstances.   Comparing the demographic results to the overall results indicates that studentâs perceived family obligations impact did not shift significantly across the survey population as well as within the ethnicity subgroups. Additionally, Cal Poly SLOâs overall population Wilcoxon signed-ranked test indicated a positive increase in instructor flexibility, which was confirmed in the ethnicity subgroup analysis which yielded two subgroups (Multiple Ethnicities and White) with a significantly higher Cycle 1 median for instructor flexibility. Separating the analysis into demographic groups demonstrated that a decrease in access to computer resources, academic engagement, instruction effectiveness, as well as increased financial stress and overall   26 stress were common across the subgroups. The one subgroup that did not experience an increase in overall stress was Cal Poly SLOâs Multiple Ethnicity subgroup.    Longitudinal Analysis  Shifting to the second topic, an initial exploratory analysis of the longitudinal data generated a combination of summary statistics, boxplots. and scatterplots (Figure 6),  which assisted in determining the nature of the response data. The summary statistic tables, boxplots, and scatterplots were replicated for each survey topic, as seen in Appendix D. Note that Cycle 0 data is not included since this analysis focuses on the variation of each survey topic interval across cycles during the pandemic.   Table 8.

Additionally, the standard deviation values indicate a large amount of variation in responses, which is visually confirmed within the scatterplots generated.    Figure 6A. Cal State LA Computer Resources Scatterplot with Unique Respondents Connected Figure 6B. Cal State LA Computer Resources Boxplot Figure 6. Computer Resources Scatterplots and Boxplots     Figure 6C. Cal Poly SLO Computer Resources Scatterplot with Unique Respondents Connected Figure 6D. Cal Poly SLO Computer Resources Boxplot    28 Qualitatively assessing the scatterplots demonstrates how an individualâs evaluation of the circumstances could vary greatly between cycles.  The connecting lines tie an individualâs response across the cycles. In the case of access to computer resources, it appears that the points and lines are much denser near the top of the interval, a positive indication that many respondents did not have issues with access to computer resources. However, the boxplots indicate a number of outliers at the bottom of the interval, revealing there were a number of individuals with extreme difficulty in accessing computer resources, even as cycles progressed and interventions ensued.   To quantitatively evaluate if the response variable changed significantly over the cycles, assumptions must be carefully tested. As previously stated, the response variables and their residuals are not normally distributed before and after transformation. Thus, any ANOVA longitudinal analysis techniques are violated and cannot be utilized. Basic nonparametric analysis to examine if variation was significant such as Kruskal-Wallis may not be viable due to the assumptions of independence of observations, which requires that each group is made up of different individuals. To avoid violating the independence assumption, a Kruskal-Wallis analysis (Table 10) was run by removing repeat respondents with cycles as the factor and the respective topic the response variable since a majority of individuals only responded once across cycles (refer to Figure 4).       29 Table 10. Kruskal-Wallis Cycles 1-6 Results  School Topic Kruskal-Wallis LA Computer Resources 0.9 LA Effectiveness 0.002 LA Engagement 1.00E-03 LA Family Obligations 0.03 LA Finances 0.2 LA Flexibility 0.5 LA Stress 1.00E-5 SLO Computer Resources 0.2 SLO Effectiveness 0.03 SLO Engagement 0.0002 SLO Family Obligations 0.8 SLO Finances 0.2 SLO Flexibility 4.00E-06 SLO Stress 2.00E-16  Table 10 indicates the initial results when using a Kruskal-Wallis test (p-values shown) to consider the independent factor cycle number with the dependent survey response variable. A significant p-value indicates that the group medians had significant changes across cycles. The results demonstrate that a majority of response topics fluctuated significantly, with CSULA access to computer resources, finances, and instructor flexibility not changing significantly, and CPSLO access to computer resources, family obligations, and financial stressors also not changing significantly.  To examine potential trends, General Estimating Equations (GEE) allows a lack of normality and missing values while modeling the changes of the population across evenly spaced cycles. The intent of GEE is to model the changes by subgrouping with a variety factors including cycle number, gender, ethnicity, etc. Any significant coefficients from GEE analysis represents a trend of that population or subgroup. While GEE is difficult to validate due to a lack   30 of a goodness-of-fit measurement, careful selection of a covariance structure typically yields dependable results (Halekoh, HÃ¸jsgaard, & Yan, 2006). A normal distribution was selected by specifying a âlinkâ identity, since the response data is neither binomial nor Poisson. In this case a âlinkâ identity is the name of the input parameter for a normal distribution. Note the assumption of constant variance is the only carryover assumption of the normal link identity when using GEE (The Pennsylvania State University, 2021). Additionally, an autoregressive covariance structure was selected, which assumes that correlation between responses decays with distance, appropriate for this data as additional institutional interventions hypothetically reduces correlation across cycles. This covariance selection was validated using the âMESSâ package in R, which allows GEE models with the same structure to be compared using QIC values when varying the covariance specification (Ekstrom, 2020).  QIC, or quasilikelihood under the independence model criterion is the GEE version of model selection criteria comparable to Akaikeâs information criterion for model selection in GLM (Cui, 2007). The specified ID for the model is the unique longitudinal ID generated by the user in their survey response. To evaluate the change in each survey topic, data was further cleaned to remove respondents that did not input a value for the specified survey topic.   Figure 7. GEE Iterations    31 As seen in Figure 7, two iterations of GEE were run. For the first iteration, each data frame was cleaned to include only the population with responses for that topic, cycle, and school combination. To appropriately run the GEE model, any responses without a unique ID were removed since the analysis requires individuals to be linked to their own observations across cycles. Additionally, unique IDâs that repeated in any cycle were separated, as duplicate observations at the same cycle for the same ID value invalidates the model fitting. This duplication of IDâs was mostly the result of respondents failing to provide answers to some of the ID generation questions, therefore not creating enough unique values within the generated ID string to differentiate from others. Since a link identity requires constant variance of the response variable across the cycles, a Fligner-Killeenâs test was utilized with the data to assess the equality of variances across cycles despite the non-normal distribution of the response variable (see Table 26). Not all school and response topic combinations passed the constant variance requirement for the Cycles 1-6 data, invalidating any GEE models generated for those topics. With the equal variance assumption checked, the model was then fit for all remaining responses for each topic.       32 Table 11. GEE Cycles 1-6 Results  School Topic Cycle Number P-Value Cycle Number Coefficient Total Responses LA Computer Resources 0.66 -0.276 576 LA Effectiveness 1.3E-05 3.681 486 LA Engagement 0.004 3.272 484 LA Family Obligations 0.42 1.42 512 LA Finances 0.0039 -2.92 549 LA Flexibility 0.78 0.245 483 LA Stress 4.00E-05 -3.08 575 SLO Computer Resources 0.21 -0.559 1522 SLO Effectiveness NA NA 1402 SLO Engagement 3.00E-4 -1.383 1398 SLO Family Obligations 0.93 0.0914 1407 SLO Finances 0.019 -1.335 1466 SLO Flexibility NA NA 1398 SLO Stress NA NA 1513  The GEE P-value column represents the p-values from testing if cycle number has a significant trend effect on the variation of the survey response variable. Note that there are three NA entries which indicates that the dataset did not meet the variance requirements for the link identity, thus model results were discarded. In this case, the GEE results indicate that CSULA instruction effectiveness, academic engagement, financial stressors, and overall stress all had a significant coefficient across Cycles 1-6, as well as CPSLO academic engagement and financial stressors. When both the GEE cycle number p-value and Kruskal-Wallis cycle number p-value are significant, a trend was significant as well as the actual fluctuation of medians. Otherwise, significant GEE p-values without significant Kruskal-Wallis p-values indicates a trend was present with insignificant changes in the median. For CSULA, Kruskal-Wallis results indicate that instruction effectiveness, academic engagement, and overall stress all yielded significant p-values for cycle number. Thus, in combination with GEE results, the positive trends for   33 instruction effectiveness and academic engagement as well as the negative trend of overall stress were accompanied by significant variation across Cycles 1 through 6.  For CPSLO this occurs with academic engagement, which demonstrates a significant negative coefficient as well as  significant variation across Cycle 1 through 6.  It is important to note that this initial model fit for Cycle 1 through 6 included survey responses across different portions of the academic year, including summer session for both institutions. Thus, the model may not be as practical for topics including access to computer resources, academic engagement, and instruction effectiveness, as individuals not attending summer session would not have been interacting with as many academic responsibilities. However, other topics, primarily impact of family obligations and financial stressors are factors that may have been continuously impacted outside of the academic responsibilities, hence why a Cycle 1 through 6 model was fit to explore potential population trends in these areas.  GEE also allows the addition of other covariate factors that may be contribute to variance in the dependent variable, thus additional analysis can be run altering the equation to consider other potential factors and find additional subgroup models. The factors added were gender, ethnicity, major, and transfer status. As noted in Figure 7, this does require the data to be further cleaned to only include responses where users inputted data for these questions. In the interest of capturing fluctuation stemming from these added factors, data was subsetted to only Cycles 1-3 to contain data from the first school session during the pandemic. This ideally reduces potential variation coming from changes in academic involvement due to entry into summer break and summer session at both institutions, while still including a large portion of responses since response counts were higher in the first few cycles.      34 Table 12.

As seen in Table 12, the subsetted data with reduced sample size and addition of the other factors altered significance for cycle number as compared to the first GEE iteration, but also allowed a deeper look into the factors that may be causing variation and trends within the response topics over the initial three cycles. Note that response numbers dropped from approximately 575 to 300 for CSULA and 1510 to 670 for CPSLO when removing Cycle 4 through Cycle 6 data. The significant p-values in Table 12 indicate that the different levels of the factor significantly impacted the variation or trends in the response variable. For example, CSULA computer resources ratings may have varied significantly depending on the individualâs gender: male, female, other, and prefer not to state in this case. However, this significance value can be misleading if the subgroup scatterplots and coefficients are not examined.    35 Table 13.

For this R GEE analysis, the baseline specified within the model setup was the grouping of other gender, other ethnicity,   36 Aviation Administration for CSULA, Aerospace Engineering for CPSLO, and freshman. This was specified in order to generate unique coefficients for the other factor levels with more specification (other gender as opposed to male or female levels). A positive coefficient indicates the model fit a positive trend for that specified factor/factor level, with the opposite true for a negative coefficient. The p-values generated for each factor/factor level belong to the Wald statistic test, which assists in determining if a predictor variable is significant or not. In this example computer resources at CSULA shows a positive trend across cycles, comparable with the GLM line fit seen in Figure 8. Note that GLM coefficients will be similar but the standard errors will differ, hence the GLM line fit serves as a good visual comparison to verify GEE coefficients.  (Stack Exchange, 2019).   Figure 8. CSULA Computer Resources Cycles 1-3 GLM Fit Comparison   Any yellow highlighted factor level seen in Table 13 indicates that this is a significant level of the factor with respect to the Wald test. However, checking the sample size may reveal only a small pool of individuals within that level, making the conclusion of significance much less   37 strong in terms of a total population conclusion. This is evident when separating the responses across cycles by gender levels:   Table 14. CSULA Computer Resources Gender Analysis   Index Label Coefficient 1 Male 17.81 2 Female 20.01 3 Transgender NA 4 Genderqueer NA 5 Gender Non-Conforming NA 6 Prefer Not To State 38.63 7 Other Intercept  As seen in Table 14, the only significant coefficient belongs to the âPrefer Not To Stateâ gender, which only contains one observation. Thus, the analysis fit a significant trend easily due to a lack of variation to counter the single observation. Note also as the cycles progress, responses decline, evident by the decreased density across cycles. This is a reoccurring response trend for both Cal State LA and Cal Poly.      38 Table 15.

Additionally, in Table 16 and Table 17 none of the major or transfer status levels yielded significant coefficients.       39 Table 16.

General Engineering group increased while Industrial Engineering group decreased. Transfer students increased.   41 Significant factors represent the factors that correlated with different trends across levels in the response variable. Note that the only time cycle number has a significant trend across the population in the response variable is at CPSLO for instruction effectiveness and overall stress. Gender is significant for thirteen out of fourteen responses, while ethnicity is significant for twelve out of fourteen responses. This indicates that a studentâs gender and ethnicity often did have an impact on their overall experience throughout the crisis. Transfer status was significant only twice for CPSLO finances and stress categories.  Additional conclusions result from significant coefficients with respect to the Wald test. In this case, they provide additional insight on how different subgroups varied over cycles. If a subgroup has a significant coefficient, this indicates that the population belonging to that subgroup can be modeled with a significant trend across the response variable. At CSULA, the Asian subgroup and Civil Engineering subgroup experienced a significant increase in academic engagement over cycles, evident by the significant positive coefficient. The Asian, Hispanic, White, and Multiple Ethnicities subgroups experienced a decrease in financial stressors over the cycles. Additionally, the CSULA Male subgroup experienced a perceived increase in instructor flexibility throughout the first three cycles. CSULA Civil Engineering and Computer Science subgroups indicated a decrease in overall stress across the cycles.  With a larger sample size, the CPSLO coefficients had many significant subgroupings. The Female and Hispanic subgroups experienced more difficulties accessing computer resources over the first three cycles. The Male and Industrial Engineering subgroups on average demonstrated a decrease in academic engagement. The African American and White subgroups experienced an increase in family obligations, which indicates a positive familial impact. The Pacific Islander and Transfer Student subgroups demonstrated an increase in financial stressors,   42 while the Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering subgroups saw a decrease in financial stressors. The overall population experienced a perceived decrease in instructor flexibility across Cycles 1 through 3. The General Engineering and Transfer Student subgroups saw an increase in overall stress over the cycles, while the Industrial Engineering subgroup saw a decrease in overall stress over time.   School Responses Comparison  To understand the differences between the two schools over the course of the cycles, a Mann-Whitney test can be run to compare the medians of the two schools for each survey response variable at each cycle point. This is valid since the data is not normally distributed but does have independent observations in each group (one group belongs to CPSLO, the other group belongs to CSULA). Prior to analysis, the dates of the cycle starts at each school must be considered since the actual cycle dates were not identical between the schools. The dates in Table 1 indicate the start of the cycle, surveys were collected throughout the two-week period.  CPSLO did not have an assigned Cycle 6, thus the analysis was performed comparing at each cycle point as well as combining the responses from Cycle 5 and Cycle 6 for CSULA. In order to conclude if the responses at one school are different than the other, a one-sided Mann-Whitney can be performed.       43 Table 19.

Thus, the highlighted red boxes indicate that CSULA had a significantly higher median as compared to CPSLO at that cycle and topic combination. In the case of the gray italicized entry, CPSLO had a significantly higher median as compared to CSULA. This unique case occurred only in Cycle 4 on the overall stress median comparison, which otherwise demonstrated that CSULA had the higher overall stress median across other cycles.  These results allow us to make several conclusions for each survey topic. Note that the before pandemic (Cycle 0) comparison demonstrated that CSULA had higher financial stress, instructor flexibility, and less overall stress from family obligations as compared to CPSLO prior to the onset of virtual conditions.   44  Figure 9. Median and Mean Comparison for Computer Resources  For access to computer resources, the CSULA and CPSLO survey populations shared a similar perception for every cycle except for Cycle 4, where CSULA had a significantly higher perceived access to computer resources. This may be explained by the difference in population involvement within classes, as CSULA was entering summer session and CPSLO had just finished final exams. No significant total population trend was found during GEE analysis since cycle number did not yield a significant coefficient.   Figure 10. Median and Mean Comparison for Effectiveness   45 For instruction effectiveness, CSULA had a significantly higher median across a majority of the cycles, excluding Cycle 1 and Cycle 5, which had institution medians that were not significantly different from one another. The decline in CPSLO instruction effectiveness across Cycle 1 through Cycle  3 echoes the results from the GEE model in the previous section, which demonstrated with a significant negative coefficient that instruction effectiveness was decreasing over the cycles.    Figure 11. Median and Mean Comparison for Engagement  Excluding Cycle 1, CSULA had a significantly higher median academic engagement rating across cycles. While the median and mean comparison plots appear to show a general increase in academic engagement ratings at both institutions, no meaningful total population trend was found during GEE analysis, most likely since the actual variation of the responses could not be averaged into a meaningful trend.     46   Figure 12. Median and Mean Comparison for Family Obligations   Excluding Cycle 2, CSULA had a significantly higher median family obligations rating across cycles, which indicates less familial stressors as compared to the CPSLO population at each cycle point. This aligns with the before pandemic comparison, which indicates that CSULAâs higher median family obligations was present before the pandemic. No meaningful population trends were found during GEE analysis for either institution.    Figure 13. Median and Mean Comparison for Finances   47  Across all cycles CSULA had a significantly higher financial stressors median as compared to CPSLO. This indicates that CSULA had a higher level of financial stressors, which is no different from before the pandemic, where the CSULA median was also higher than CPSLOâs median. Note that no total population trend was found for either institution, however transfer students from CPSLO experienced a significant increase in financial stressors across Cycles 1 through 3.       Figure 14. Median and Mean Comparison for Flexibility   Perceived median instructor flexibility ratings at both institutions remained similar across all cycles except Cycle 4, where CSULA had a higher instructor flexibility rating post-finals. Note that the Cycle 0 ratings comparison demonstrated that CSULA had a higher median instructor flexibility rating as compared to CPSLO, but this advantage disappeared once virtual instruction began. CPSLO did have a significant negative coefficient indicating a decrease in instructor flexibility across Cycle 1 through Cycle 3.    48    Figure 15. Median and Mean Comparison for Stress   CSULA had a significantly higher overall stress median for every cycle except Cycle 4, when the academic term had ended for CSULA. GEE analysis indicated a significant stress increase via a significant positive cycle number coefficient, which seems to visually hold true for Cycle 1 through Cycle 3.   It is interesting to note that Cycle 4 is the only cycle where CSULA and CPSLO had significantly different medians for every response topic. This may be attributed to the difference in academic calendars, which would place CSULA in summer session and CPSLO just after final exams. Additionally, Cycle 1 had the least amount of significantly different medians for the academic ratings, which may be the result of immediate failure to adjust academic techniques at the start of virtual schooling. General takeaways from this school comparison are as follows:  â¢ CSULA and CPSLO generally did not have large differences in perceived access to computer resources.  â¢ CSULA had higher instruction effectiveness ratings across a majority of cycles.    49 â¢ CSULA had higher academic engagement ratings across a majority of cycles.  â¢ CSULA had less negative effects from familial stressors across a majority of cycles. â¢ CSULA had higher financial stressors across all cycles. â¢ CSULA and CPSLO generally did not have large differences in perceived instructor flexibility.  â¢ CSULA had higher overall stress ratings across a majority of cycles.  To reiterate, the before pandemic (Cycle 0) comparison demonstrated that CSULA had higher financial stress, instructor flexibility, and less stress from family obligations as compared to CPSLO prior to the onset of virtual conditions. Thus, since the CSULA and CPSLO instructor flexibility ratings during the pandemic did not appear to be perceived differently between the two institutions, CSULA appears to have lost their before-pandemic advantage of more flexible instructors. The results of the quantitative analysis attempts to map the general experiences of the engineering student populations at both CPSLO and CSULA, however this generalization erases the experiences that may be more unique. The survey provided to the students also featured two questions seeking qualitative elaboration on student circumstances after the onset of virtual instruction.  VI.  Discussion  The first qualitative question requested advice on how the university could provide additional help to students. To summarize student feedback, survey responses were reviewed and the most popular and unique contributions were consolidated. Note that approximately 65% of CPSLO students and 64% of CSULA students did not provide feedback or had no criticism for the university. The students that did provide feedback at CPSLO and CSULA had similar requests as outlined in Table 20.    50 Table 20. Qualitative Summary of Potential University Assistance Methods  What additional help can the university  provide to you at this time? CPSLO CSULA - Cheaper tuition and refunding fees for services no longer operational - Encourage professors to assign consistent work rather than pile it on as overcompensation - Reach out to students about mental health - More flexibility in classes - Help professors with technology so it does not impact teaching effectiveness - Access to textbooks online that previously only resided physically in library - Requiring professors to record and post lecture notes - Use social media to showcase how students and teachers alike are adjusting - Financial assistance and housing guidance - Ensure professors understand new environmental conditions impacts student learning  - Health resources - Quarantined study spaces - Remove increased out-of-state tuition - Better information on community resources/ open businesses in SLO area - Cheaper tuition and refunding fees for services no longer operational - Encourage professors to assign consistent work rather than pile it on as overcompensation - Reach out to students about mental health - Provide technology to rent - Help professors understand that the circumstances are distracting and demotivating - Add extra credit opportunities for when circumstances reduce ability to perform as well - Improve access to financial and educational resources - Childcare - Standardize how professors record and post lectures - Quiet place to study - Provide internet resources - Educate professors on virtual teaching techniques - Consistent updates on the situation  Many students emphasized the increased financial stressors and frustrations given the reduced access to university resources and services without a change in tuition or fees. Additionally, students called for technology assistance for professors, citing a frustration with professors who lacked technological capabilities and often had reduced instruction success. This couples with   51 the request for a standardization of recording and posting lectures for students. An addition of quarantined study spaces was requested often, with many students illustrating how distracting and draining it could be to attempt work at home. CSULA students had multiple requests for childcare options or assistance, while not a single CPSLO student mentioned childcare difficulties.  Both groups requested consistent updates on available services, including mental health resources, local community events, financial assistance, and housing guidance. One CPSLO student requested that social media be employed to showcase how all students and faculty members alike were adjusting to the virtual instruction. Both institutions made attempts to communicate with students, staff, and faculty throughout the crisis, with 119 announcements for CPSLO and 64 announcements for CSULA (Cal Poly, n.d.) (Cal State LA, n.d.).       52 The second qualitative question inquired about the stay-at-home situation, specifically the positive and negative aspects of the stay-at-home situation.   Table 21. Qualitative Summary of Stay-At-Home Situation  Anything positive or negative about the stay-at-home situation?  School CPSLO CSULA Negative Impact - Harder to stay motivated and focused - Deteriorating mental and physical  health - Limited access to materials reduces productivity - No hands-on experience during labs - No physical separation between school and home - Less engagement and interaction with other students - Unsafe neighborhoods at home - Poor internet options - Cannot work at the moment - Difficult with family or roommates to find alone spaces  - Additional family obligations  - Time zone differences - Lack of interaction and engagement - Lack of separation between home and school - Easily distracted  - Childcare responsibilities competing with academic responsibilities - High financial stress - Difficult to share spaces with roommates or family - Difficult to access office hours, campus events, or health center services - Emotional impact from losing family members or friends - Increased anxiety and depression - Reduced lab effectiveness  Positive Impact - No social pressure or shame from taking time to pause instruction to catch up  - Less time commuting  - Cheaper dining options off-campus - Greater flexibility in some classes - No commuting to classes - Greater flexibility in some classes - Get to see family more - More recorded lectures to review later on    53 As seen in Table 21, both groups indicated difficulties on staying motivated, engaged, and productive. A lack of separation between school and home especially created pressures for those with children, with several indicating that they felt the need to choose between their children and academic responsibilities even more so with their children consistently nearby. Limited access to materials and difficulties with technology or internet was also consistently reiterated. Additional family obligations and financial stressors were commonly stated, with several students indicating how stressful it was to either lose jobs or have to work jobs that put their families at risk.   Despite the many negative aspects cited by students, there were a few positive aspects shared across both institutions. Commonly, no commuting to classes appeared to gain favor in terms of saving both time and money, with a few exceptions when individuals preferred a commute to reset between school and home responsibilities. Having recorded lectures to consistently refer back to also yielded support. One student stated that these recorded lectures allowed them to have no shame in pausing the instruction video to catch up or re-watch certain topics, as opposed to feeling shame in-person when falling behind during class.  There was a subsection of students that preferred the at-home instruction for its flexibility and increased family time.    Potential Intervention Impacts    Several of the students at both institutions qualitatively referred to specific interventions assisting them. Namely the CARES Act, which was enacted as of March 27th, 2020. This allowed the creation of both Cal Poly Cares and Cal State La Cares. The amount allocated to Cal Poly under the CARES ACT was $14,095,976, with $7,047,988 intended for student grants (Cal Poly, 2021). Additional funds were allocated due to the Higher Education Emergency Relief   54 Grant (HEERF II) as of December 27th, 2020. This amounted to $20,752,799 with $7,047,988 authorized for student aid. In total, 6,736 students were assisted by the CARES ACT funds while 4,562 students have been assisted via HEERF II funds as of April 7th, 2021. To compare, Cal State La Cares was allocated $18,957,083 for students and distributed those funds via financial grants to 26,976 students (Cal State LA, 2021). Additionally, CSULA used other funds for students ineligible for financial grants, funneling $1.3 million to 1,395 undocumented or international students, and $340,777 for 739 additional students via the Office of the Dean of Students. HEERF II added another $61,905,561 with $18,957,083 specified for students. As of March 31st, 2021,  20,376 CSULA students were assisted with these funds. CSULA also specifically bought 5,000+ Wi-Fi hotspots and laptops, thus far distributing 2,000 of those to students and faculty.  The financial assistance was apparent in the qualitative responses, with several students specifically calling out the CARES Act assistance as a positive intervention. Additionally, the CSULA GEE longitudinal model for Cycle 1 through Cycle 3 echoed the impact of these financial interventions, with the CSULA Asian, Hispanic, White, and Multiple Ethnicities subgroups experiencing a significant decrease in financial stressors as noted in Table 18.  CPSLO did not have the same significant subgroup trends, with only the Pacific Islander subgroup yielding a significant positive coefficient for a smaller sample size (3 individuals), indicating instead an increasing negative impact on academics due to financial stressors. Note that there were no significant trends with access to computer resources outside of the CPSLO Hispanic subgroup experiencing a significant decrease in access to computer resources over the first three cycles.       55 Intervention Recommendations  Both institutions made efforts to improve the academic environment within the virtual circumstances, however, qualitative and quantitative feedback showed that many of these non-financial interventions were not as impactful as institutions hoped. Students faced a tremendous change that impact their access to resources as well as decreased their potential for building meaningful social connections within their academic communities. This is seen in the initial significant negative changes in perceived computer resource accessibility, instruction effectiveness, academic engagement, financial stress, instructor flexibility, and overall stress. To find new methods of intervening, focusing on proven intervention programs similar to the Dell programâs web-based platform or ASAP can be helpful, both featuring a blended intrusive and formal advising virtual system with warning systems designed to evaluate and flag potential academic and financial fluctuations.  New methods of interventions inside and out of the classroom have also been created and studied within recent times. This includes the Student Experience Project at the University of Berkeley, which advises four practices that all professors could utilize to enhance a sense of belonging within the virtual academic environment: normalizing challenges and providing strategies to overcome then, checking in with students about course and resources, provide feedback that is critical but helpful, and sharing a âfavorite mistakeâ with students (Murphy, Boucher, & Logel, 2021). The project asked instructors to virtually enact these practices and found that studentsâ sense of belong increased. The Association of American Colleges & Universities supplied their own general recommendations to assist deepening connections with students including determining if students have reliable internet and computer access, incorporating engagement strategies within classes, integrating advising services within courses   56 early on, and offering training to students on use of technologies seen within the college (Garcia, Adkins, & Bohlig, 2020). As Karp stated, the actual effort to âimprove persistence should focus on processes, not programsâ, and incorporating these strategies within each faculty and staff member assists in the student experience or lack thereof (Karp, 2011).  VII.  Conclusion  The initial quantitative analysis focused on three general questions: 1. Did the onset of virtual instruction and pandemic significantly impact each schoolâs general population in the surveyed topics? 2. Did certain subgroups experience vastly different changes in circumstances over time?  3. Did the CPSLO and CSULA student bodies have different perceptions of their conditions over the cycles?  The three avenues of analysis served to unveil many interesting trends from the student point-of-view. The first question analysis revealed that significant changes were experienced across the engineering student body, with access to computer resources, instruction effectiveness, academic engagement, financial stressors, instructor flexibility, and overall stress all shifting significantly when comparing the student perception of before and after the transition to virtual instruction. The second question analysis (outlined in Table 18) demonstrated how different subgroups of gender, ethnicity, major, and transfer status did experience different changes in circumstances over the course of the first portion of virtual instruction. Finally, the comparison between Cal Poly SLO and Cal State LA proved that the different institutional responses and student body characteristics did impact the student experience differently throughout the onset of virtual instruction and global pandemic as a whole.    57 Although the quantitative analysis provided more information of the student experience during the pandemic, improvements and additions are possible to pull more information from this rich dataset. One main improvement that could be made in future work would be to consolidate the gender levels into male, female, and other, primarily to increase the sample size of the other group to capture the experiences of all those that do not identify within the two primary groups. The actual GEE models generated featured an intercept coefficient for the combined baseline levels of each additional factor added in the Cycles 1 through 3 models. In future iterations, additional exploration of removing the intercept when the intercept is significant would be ideal to reveal any additional trends potentially hidden within the intercept baseline group. Future models could also remove insignificant factors to investigate potential changes in significance for coefficients of levels within significant factors.  In terms of additional quantitative analysis, structural equation modeling would be an interesting avenue of analysis for determining how different latent variables related to the overall survey response outputs. Structural equation modeling (SEM) allows analysts to develop âcomplex relationships between one or more independent variables and one or more dependent variablesâ (Purdue Statistcs, n.d.). Specifically factors already analyzed within the GEE analysis (gender, ethnicity, transfer status, and major) could be utilized in the SEM process to more deeply investigate these factors impact on studentâs perception of their circumstances. While the conclusions from these analysis sections strove to model the average population and their subgroups, the qualitative data containing the more in-depth stories remained largely unused outside of initial summarization of repeated and unique comments. To ensure all perspectives are actively examined to assist in recommendations for school interventions, it is recommended future work focuses on open coding the qualitative responses of both the student   58 responses and teacher/faculty responses, while also sending out a new survey specifically seeking a qualitative assessment of the overall response. This would assist in rounding out the examination of the institutional response, while providing updated feedback on top of the initial feedback. For potential future surveys aiming to take interval ratings of respondent circumstances it is recommended to track users via email as opposed to relying on user-generated longitudinal identifiers. To increase participation, it may be ideal to provide respondent monetary compensation to ensure individuals respond consistently over time. Interesting application scenarios mimicking this survey setup includes surveying new hires at businesses to understand and improve onboarding experiences, surveying freshmen or transfer students when first entering academic communities to examine acclimation, or surveying individuals exiting the prison system to understand the adjustment process.     59 VIII.

The yellow highlighted factor level seen in âPrefer not to stateâ gender indicates that this is a significant level of the gender factor with respect to the Wald test.   90 However, checking the sample size reveals only one individual is grouped within this gender level, making the conclusion of significance much less strong in terms of a total population conclusion. Ethnicity is also significant, although no specific level of the factor yielded model significance.    Figure 37.

    "abstract": "At California State University, Los Angeles and California Polytechnic University, San Luis\nObispo, a longitudinal survey was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for students within their respective engineering departments. A combination of nonparametric and longitudinal analysis is performed to evaluate the impacts of the transition to a virtual educational environment and the stressors brought on by the global pandemic. Additional qualitative evaluation is performed to gain insight and make program recommendations to enhance the resilience of individuals in the academic systems. Results demonstrate a large shift in circumstances immediately at the start of the pandemic, with a variety of significant trends across the survey cycles and topics. A comparison of the two institutions both qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate how different institutional responses and student bodies impacted the overall student experience",
