ORIGINAL ARTICLE Open AccessAddressing the Needs of Transgender Military Veterans:Better Access and More Comprehensive CareMichelle Dietert,1,* Dianne Dentice,2 and Zander Keig3AbstractPurpose: There is a gap in social science literature addressing issues of access and quality of care for transgendermilitary veterans. Psychologists, medical doctors, and other health professionals are beginning to address some ofthe barriers present in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system that affect veterans who are also transgenderand intersex. Over a 7-year period, between 2006 and 2013, 2600 transgender veterans were served by the VA. Datafrom several surveys revealed that most transgender veterans perceive the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) tobe less than accommodating for their special needs. The goal of this study was to investigate the experiences of asample of transgender veterans with regard to their experiences with healthcare services provided by the VHA.Methods: Using snowball sampling techniques, we were able to recruit 22 transgender military veterans to par-ticipate in our study. A combination of telephone interviews and questionnaires provided data from veterans invarious branches of the military throughout the United States.Results: Findings indicate that even though the VHA is working to address issues of inequality for transgender vet-erans, our participants indicated that there are still someproblemswith administration of care, proper training of staffandphysicians, and availability of comprehensive services for the uniquehealthcare needs of transgender individuals.Conclusion: Since our data were collected, the VA has worked to bridge the gap by focusing on increased train-ing for VHA providers and staff and establishing LGBT programs at VA facilities. However, we suggest that one keyarea of importance should continue to focus on how mental health and medical providers and ancillary staff aretrained to interact with and provide care for their transgender patients.Keywords: gender identity discrimination; transgender; U.S. military; Veterans Health AdministrationIntroductionAlthough there are only an estimated 1.4 million peoplein the United States who identify as transgender, currentstatistics shows they are more likely to serve in the mili-tary than their peers.1,2 About 48% of Army veteranswho served on active duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom(OIF) or Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) enrolledin and used the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)within 1 year of separation from the military.1 Thestudy included >151,000 active-duty members who haddeployed and then separated from the Army between2008 and 2012. Of the >125,000 National Guard and>48,000 Reserve members included in that study, about57% and 46%, respectively, enrolled with the VHA within12 months of being demobilized.3 These figures illustratethe importance of the VHA to our military veterans.In 2007, the VHA began focusing on local policiesregarding provision of care to transgender veteransand then on June 1, 2011, VHA Directive 2011-024was issued in an attempt to standardize treatment ser-vices for transgender veterans.4 The goal of the mostupdated directive, VHA 2013-003, is to also ensurethat adequate healthcare is provided to transgenderand intersex veterans. Since transgender individuals1Texas A&M University—Central Texas, Killeen, Texas.2Stephen F.

As the data indicate, some of the transgenderveterans were faced with a multitude of issues directlyrelated to their gender identity when seeking heath-care with the VHA. Our study adds to the literaturedealing with transgender individuals, specificallytransgender military veterans who need quality men-tal health and medical services. As the review of theliterature reveals, there is little qualitative researchon this subject matter.Our data focus on the participant’s experiences withthe Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). It is impor-tant to point out that our participants were interviewedduring and after the VHA Directive 2013-003 was re-leased by the Department of Veterans Affairs on Febru-ary 8, 2013. The Directive was written to ensure thatadequate healthcare is provided to transgender and in-tersex veterans. Since our interviews were conducted,the VA has made improvements by providing moretraining and resources to VHA staff and outreach totransgender veterans. However, at the time of our in-terviews and currently, the VA does not provide sexreassignment surgery (SRS)* and other proceduresneeded for transition; an issue for some of the veteransinterviewed in our study. Although a step in the rightdirection, we suggest that the VA continue to focuson training mental health and medical providers andancillary staff to provide proper care for their transgen-der patients, including provision of better access to asystem that is steeped in bureaucratic rules and regula-tions relating directly to gender identity. The reviewof the literature that follows specifically addresses theexperiences of transgender veterans with healthcareproviders at the VHA as well as some of the currentprograms that are being utilized to positively impacttransgender patient care.Review of the LiteratureTransgender military veterans:challenges after serviceIn a study including 141 trans women veterans, the re-searchers examined healthcare utilization and potentialbarriers to accessing care for this population.7 Theyfound that the use of the VHA was higher among trans-gender veterans than the general population of veterans.Approximately 9.3% of the sample sought mentalhealth services from the VHA and the population hadhigher than average levels of depression when com-pared to the general nonmilitary population. Veteransin the study also reported suffering from post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD) along with the need for genderidentity counseling. Documented barriers included thecost of health services and the veterans’ perceived reac-tion by medical providers to their gender identity.One study directly explored discriminatory practicesaimed at transgender military personnel.8 Focusing onthe data collected in 2008 from the University of Califor-nia, Santa Barbara, the researcher found that in regard tothe VA, there were patient care problems and lack of co-hesive polices as these relate to transgender veterans. Forinstance, some patients were given inconsistent informa-tion about SRS, were not addressed using pronouns thataligned with their gender identity, and in some cases,were refused service by the VA. Overall, transgender vet-erans reported that they dealt with many mental andmedical health restrictions.Researchers conducted a study in two VA centers inOklahoma and Texas in hopes of improving service toLGBT veterans.9 The sample consisted of 202 VA pro-viders and 58 LGBT veterans. One finding indicatedthat 93% (n= 54) LGBT veterans thought that it wassomewhat or very important for the VA to be welcoming,while 81% (n= 164) of the VA providers shared thissame view. Despite these findings, only a minority ofboth VA providers and LGBT veterans viewed their hos-pital as welcoming. The researchers concluded that pro-viders should have more training in working with sexualand gender minority clients along with exposure to liter-ature documenting risk factors for LGBT patients.One study explored the experiences of transgenderveterans with the VHA.10 The researchers recruitedand interviewed 11 transgender veterans from the2013 Southern Comfort Conference in Atlanta, Geor-gia. Like the current study, the researchers found thattransgender veterans continued to face challengeswhen seeking healthcare. The VHA not only lackedknowledge in transition-related care but some*SRS is also known as gender confirmation surgery. In this article, we will use thefirst term for consistency. Both are terms used by some medical professionals torefer to surgical options that alter a person’s physical attributes to match theirgender identity.Dietert, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2016.004036transgender veterans also experienced insensitivity,harassment, and violence in some VA clinics. Find-ings also indicated that providers lacked a generalknowledge about transgender people.Regarding clinicians and staff who provide mentalhealth and medical care services to transgender veterans,framers of Directive 2013-003 address the need for moreknowledge and education about transgender health is-sues and specifically state that transgender veteransshould be treated with dignity and respect. Professionalconsultation on complicated cases within Veterans Inte-grated Service Networks (VISN) or facilities is encour-aged by the VA along with cultural awareness andsensitivity education for field staff. For instance, theVHA Transgender SCAN-ECHO (Specialty Care AccessNetwork–Extension of Community Healthcare Out-comes) was introduced in 2011 to train VHA providerson transgender patient care. According to one study,‘‘This program is innovative in its national scope, inter-disciplinary team model, and multihub structure.’’11 Uti-lizing a 3-year pilot program, the researchers found inthe first cohort of learners (n= 33) that the SCAN-ECHO was very successful in delivering training ontransgender care. In fact, respondent’s confidence levelsto treat transgender veterans increased from 59% to83% after completing the 14-session, 7-month program.In addition to SCAN-ECHO, the VHA has implementeda 3-year nationwide interdisciplinary e-consultation pro-gram on transgender health. The goal of this program isto give consultation to providers who treat transgenderveterans at the VHA. In over a 17-month period, 303e-consults were given to providers on transgender-related care issues to include hormones (n= 125), pri-mary care concerns (n= 97), mental health (n= 63),and psychotherapy (n= 18).12 Overall, e-consultationcomplements SCAN-ECHO and other trainings offeredby the VHA. With regard to total integration of thesepolicies, much rests with the ability of large bureaucraticorganizations to minimize barriers and maximize oppor-tunities for advancement of important initiatives such asthose discussed above.TheoryThe downfall of bureaucratic rational calculationMax Weber is well known for his sociological perspec-tives on bureaucracy and its effects on modern-daycapitalist societies. Writing in the late 19th and intothe early 20th centuries, Weber witnessed the rise of in-dustrialization, with particular attention to institutionsreflecting the modern bureaucratic state. Some charac-teristics of bureaucracy include an explicit division oflabor with clear lines of authority, an office hierarchy,written rules and regulations, and management byrules that are emotionally neutral.13 The type of legiti-mate authority found in the bureaucratic state is basedon rational–legal domination, where legitimacy is de-rived from both legal and rational components. Thelegal component implies ‘‘rules or laws which are ac-cepted by subordinates’’ and the rational componentwhich suggests that ‘‘rules are effective and efficientin accomplishing specific and immediate objectives.’’14Based on rational–legal domination, an administrativestaff carries out tasks and outcomes that are calculated,efficient, and predictable. The end result of bureau-cratic, rational calculation is that it fails to sympathizewith the human condition in all its forms. Rational ac-tion becomes the rule rather than the exception.The Department of Veteran’s Affairs might be de-scribed as a ruling organization that ‘‘exists insofar as itsmembers are subject to domination by virtue of the estab-lished order.’’15 In other words, the VA is a bureaucracythat functions with strict adherence to rules and regula-tions. It is part of the military industrial complex thatfalls under the oversight of highly bureaucratized rationalauthority figures. Organizations need regulations for orderand efficiency; however, the human element or ‘‘subjectiverights of the individual’’ are often lost in the bureaucraticshuffle.15 Purely rational calculation often results in ir-rational consequences, particularly for transgender andintersex veterans. For instance, the VHA Directive 2013-003 was passed to address the healthcare needs of trans-gender and intersex veterans and provides for hormonaltherapy, mental healthcare, preoperative evaluation, andmedically necessary postoperative and long-term care fol-lowing SRS. Although a step in the right direction, thereare no provisions for SRS services or reconstructive sur-gery; both important elements in the bigger picture oftransgender healthcare.16,17Powers of governance in an organization such as theVA invest authority figures such as doctors and otheradministrators with a set of rules that are not easily ad-justed or changed. These external laws or rules give of-ficials legal–rational authority since there is a demandfor expert administration in large institutions such asthe VA. Government bureaucrats receive a fixed salaryand get jobs based on specific technical skills locatedwithin a well-defined hierarchical institution. Rulesand official documents are binding and powerful forcesagainst any kind of compromise. In order for the VA toprovide the best healthcare for transgender veterans,Dietert, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2016.004037authority figures at the top levels of the VA hierarchymust re-evaluate the policy limitations set forth by Direc-tive 2013-003. Although programs such as SCAN-ECHOand e-consultation are steps in the right direction, allow-ing for all transition-related care would be most benefi-cial for transgender veterans.Utilizing Weber’s theoretical perspective on bureau-cracy, the researchers in this study chose to investigatethe experiences of transgender veterans impacted by ratio-nal–legal domination as set forth by policies that impacttheir healthcare. Challenging the authority of bureaucraticdecision-making, the transgender veterans in this studycommunicate to the reader their experiences with theVA, including suggestions on how the administrationcan become more accountable by supporting policiesthat address transgender care of veterans.Data and MethodsA total of 22 transgender veterans were interviewedfrom August 5, 2012, to July 15, 2013. Participantsserved in the following military branches: Navy, AirForce, Marines, Army, Army National Guard, andCoast Guard. Each individual was given a pseudonymand any other identifying details were disguised or al-tered to ensure anonymity. Data collection includedphone interviews and questionnaires. Fifteen of theparticipants stated that they had accessed the VHAwithin 1 year of the interviews. Five of the participantswho submitted questionnaires had not used VHA ser-vices during the time of the interviews. Two of the par-ticipants did not comment when asked about theirexperiences with the VHA. Refer to Table 1 for a demo-graphic profile of the participants.Using nonprobability sampling, participants wererecruited via purposive and snowball sampling tech-niques. The lead investigator made contact with a mem-ber of Service Members, Partners, Allies for Respect andTolerance for All (SPART*A), an advocacy organiza-tion for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender veteransand active duty service members, their families, andtheir allies. This individual sent out requests for partic-ipants through transgender chat rooms and otheronline sources. People who were interested then con-tacted the lead investigator through e-mail to set up aphone interview or to request a questionnaire. One par-ticipant (Brittany) elected to do both. Each participantgave his/her consent verbally. The purpose of a verbalversus a signed consent form was to ensure confidenti-ality and to increase recruitment because of the un-willingness of many transgender individuals to speakout about their military experiences. The use of verbalrather than signed consent was approved by a universityinstitutional review board (IRB).NVivo, an updated version of the NUD*IST (Non-numerical Unstructured Data*Indexing, Searching,and Theorizing) software program, was utilized to or-ganize the transcribed and questionnaire data. Readingthrough each interview, the lead investigator usedTable 1.

From this analysis emergedthemes that would structure the Findings section ofthis research project. From the 22 interviews, a totalof 12 transcripts were transcribed and uploaded intoNVivo. An additional 10 questionnaires were uploadedinto NVivo. Examples of research questions include thefollowing: (1) Why did you join the military? (2) Tell meabout your experiences as a service member when youwere actively serving our country. (3) When you wereserving, how did you negotiate your gender identitywithin the gender expectations of the military? (4) As atransgender veteran, have you been denied healthcareor turned down for any treatment that you needed be-cause of your gender identity? (5) What kind of policychanges do you think could be added or eliminatedthat impact transgender veterans and those who are cur-rently serving? After the data were organized into themes,a node report was generated providing the researcherswith the raw data used to construct the Findings section.FindingsOur data focus on the participant’s experiences withthe Department of Veteran Affairs. Our participantswere interviewed during and after the release ofVHA Directive 2013-003 by the Department of Veter-ans Affairs on February 8, 2013. The Directive waswritten to ensure that adequate healthcare is providedto transgender and intersex veterans. It is importantto note that at the time of our interviews, the VAhad still not addressed the issue of funding SRS andother surgical procedures; an issue for some of theveterans interviewed in our study. The data revealthat in some cases, there was confusion about whattypes of healthcare would be covered by the VA atthe time of interviews. There were also some concernsabout what might happen in the future for transgen-der veterans who need care at the VA. This uncer-tainty is a possible reflection of the transitionalpolicies being drafted during the time frame of datacollection. The comments that follow focus on trans-gender care and general healthcare issues.Transgender individuals, and particularly transgen-der veterans, are often misunderstood by healthcareproviders.18 These negative experiences can influencewhether or not transgender veterans decide to seekhealthcare and continue with ongoing and preventativetreatment. The VHA Directive 2013-003 has ensuredthat VA medical personnel are educated about theneeds of the transgender and intersex population.19Brittany (trans woman) discusses her first appointmentwith the VA:So I went to the VA for my first appointment with my primarynurse or whatever they call it. Actually I was sitting there in askirt and stuff, and the lady came out and called (male namedeleted). I wasn’t about to jump up then. There were two sec-tions so she went to the other section. So when she did that, Istood up. And when she turned back around, I kind of mo-tioned to her. Now she wasn’t disrespectful. She just wasn’ttrained in etiquette I guess. I was trying to find out if therewere other transgender people coming through. And at thatpoint, I think I said ‘‘Are there other people coming throughlike me?’’ And she said ‘‘You mean drag queens?’’ I said‘‘No, I’m not a drag queen.’’ Other than that, it’s been prettynice. Back to my first visit with the nurse, I asked her ifthere was anything they could do about electrolysis. She saidshe would ask.According to Brittany, she does not believe thenurse was intentionally disrespectful. Had she receiveda minimum of training, she would have known to askBrittany how she self-identified her gender. This be-havior would align with policies detailed in the VHADirective 2013-003. Brittany also requested informa-tion about electrolysis, a necessary procedure fortransgender women that positively contributes to thetransition process. Although the VA does providesome healthcare relating to gender identity, electroly-sis is currently not part of the healthcare plan fortransgender veterans.Anna (intersex/female) was the only intersex vet-eran interviewed for this study. She served as a PettyOfficer First Class in the Navy. During her service,Anna presented as male, although her gender wasoften times questioned by others. According to Anna,‘‘Intersex people typically have to deal with being thebrunt of jokes because everybody can see that the boylooks more like a girl. The girl acts more like a man.’’In other words, many times it is not easy to gender aperson as either male or female who has an intersexcondition. Anna was laid off from her civilian joband lost her health insurance, so she enrolled at theVA. During her enrollment, she was asked about thename discrepancy on the DD Form 214 (DD214), adocument for identifying the veteran’s status at dis-charge. She explained that she underwent SRS andhad changed her name. The receptionist in the lobbyasked loudly, ‘‘Did you go to Thailand to get the sexchange?’’ Humiliated, Anna walked out of the VAand refused to return. She went on to say that shefiled a complaint stating the receptionist needed moretraining to deal effectively with transgender veterans.Dietert, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2016.004039Another veteran, Katherine (trans woman), wasconcerned about getting her name changed in theVA system:As far as I know I’m listed in the system. I legally had my namechanged to Katherine before I was discharged and the VA’s re-cords should say only Katherine. I’m sure they’ve got papersthat say otherwise but for the most part my record was goneback through and Kenneth was scratched out with Katherinewritten right above it.At the time of our interviews, transgender veteranscan ask to have their sex and gender changed in theComputerized Patient Record System (CPRS); how-ever, they must provide a letter from a physician pro-viding specific information as outlined by the Officeof Informatics and Analytics.20 The veteran must alsoprovide legal documentation to include either a newor amended birth certificate or passport.Whether identifying as trans women or trans men,most of the veterans in this study agreed that having ac-cess to hormone therapy was very important. At thistime, the VA does provide cross-sex hormone therapy.Before getting hormone therapy, the individual must beevaluated and monitored over time to ensure positiveresults. When asked if she had ever been denied health-care or treatment as it related to her gender identity,Amy (trans woman) had this to say:No, I have never been turned down from the time that I beganmy transition. I started with black market hormones until Ihad found out that the Phoenix VA was providing treatmentback in 2005.Before going to the VA, Steven (trans man) educatedhimself on the transition process. He wanted to makesure that he was prepared to make informed decisionsabout his care.Of course I did my research so I had read, studied, printed andhighlighted the standards of care. I put together precisely whatwas needed for them to give me. So I got my referral to endo-crinology. I went to endocrinology with everything that theyneeded. They didn’t even have to interview me. I gave thema written, signed document that they just stick in my file sothat they didn’t have to bother to go through it. You know out-lining what I understood about testosterone and all of that. Iwas on T within 3 weeks. Within 2 months I had my hyster-ectomy and within 6 months I had my top surgery done. Rightnow I’m still busy losing weight and saving money for lowersurgery because of course being a vet, SRS is excluded.As Steven mentioned above, he utilized the ‘‘stan-dards of care’’ as an educational resource on transgen-der care. The overall goal of World ProfessionalAssociation for Transgender Health (WPATH) stan-dards of care is to provide clinical guidance for healthprofessionals to assist transsexual, transgender, andgender-nonconforming people with safe and effectiveways to achieve overall health, psychological well-being, and self-fulfillment.21 For Steven, going intothe VA with knowledge about transition helped speedup the process. He stated that he was denied SRS bythe VA:They will take care of everything except SRS. Actually a transman can go get phalloplasty and then come back to the VAand get their erectile device paid for and installed by the VAbecause you’re then just a dude who can’t get it up becauseyour transition is considered complete.David (trans man) explained a postoperative proce-dure mentioned by Steven in this way:So for instance, if one does have genital reconstruction butthere is no urethral extension, the urethroplasty that is doneso that they can stand and void, the VA will provide that sur-gery because it’s not SRS. It’s just male enhancement surgery.They will put in an erection pump because you have erectiledysfunction and it enhances your life as a man. So it’s interest-ing that they are willing to provide certain surgeries but notothers. I’d like to see them at least begin to refer people outof network to surgeons who are proficient in those surgeriesand cover then partially or fully depending on status of the vet.As mentioned previously, transgender care as weknow it may change in the near future since the VA iscurrently considering providing SRS to transgender vet-erans. In addition, since the time of Steven’s and David’sinterviews, more is being offered to transgender individ-uals who seek to transition. Some U.S. health insurancecompanies now cover transgender care to include em-ployer provided group plans, Medicare/Medicaid, andsome state insurance plans.22Pete (trans man) was diagnosed with severe PTSD.He had this to say when asked about the healthcarehe had received from the VA:They got me some real good therapy going for my PTSD. Nowthat I’ve transitioned, they have been very good about that.They won’t change your name on your military records orwhen you were considered female. But like all of my recordsnow are under my male name of Pete. Because of my PTSD,they take care of my.I see a psych doc regularly and theygive me my anti-depressant medications. They give me mytestosterone which I was shocked that they would do that.The Department of Defense (DoD) allows namechanges in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility ReportingSystem (DEERS) and on the Military Discharge Recordor DD214 by submitting DD Form 149, which is an ap-plication for correction of Military Record.23 Althoughit is not guaranteed that the Board of Corrections forMilitary Records will accept a correction, this procedureis currently the best way to request a name change. Atthe time of the interview, this option was not availableDietert, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2016.004040for Pete. Debbie (trans woman) stated that the VeteransBenefits Administration (VBA) was ‘‘dragging theirfeet’’ to get her on disability.I was in from 2005 to July 2008. Honorably discharged and allof that. I did my time and got out. I was a paratrooper in themilitary. I’ve got a lot of jumps under my belt and I was over inIraq for 15 months. I did 20 or so jumps. I got blown up likethree times or something. So I’m not going in to scam the sys-tem or any type of thing. And I know a lot of people do but Ihave a harder time turning my neck. I can’t touch my chin tomy shoulder like not even close. I can’t touch my chin to mychest. I’ve lost a lot of motion in my neck. I have the ringing inthe ears and went in for PTSD also. I have a lot of issues Iguess. So I’m just trying to work out a lot of things and seeingwhat happens. So it’s just one of those things where I’m fight-ing them and they are just dragging their feet about it.As David stated, regardless of transgender status, it can‘‘takemonths to years’’ to get on disability. At this time, thebacklog in disability claims continues to be addressed bythe VA in an effort to provide care for all veterans.What these experiences illustrate is that regardless ofgender identity, transgender veterans need access tohealthcare. As Brittany (trans woman) mentioned inher interview regarding the DoD:Well you know one of the lies that they told us when we wentin back in 1960 was you serve us for 4 years and we’ll take careof you for the rest of your life. And that has been not a com-plete truth.It is evident that more needs to be done to ensure thatour transgender and intersex veterans are provided ade-quate healthcare by the VA that includes SRS and othersurgeries needed to complete the transition process. AsDavid (trans man) mentioned above, ‘‘it’s interesting thatthey arewilling toprovide certain surgeries butnotothers.’’Another trend found in the data is that some trans-gender veterans either had not enrolled or chose not toseek healthcare at the VA. For Julia (trans woman), itwas just a matter of taking the time to enroll. Whenasked if she used the VA, she had this to say:No in fact I keep saying that I need to go register at the VAbecause I know they need the body count to get their funding,to keep their funding. But I just haven’t registered at the VAso.And my husband is 11 years older than me and he hasnot registered at the VA either so we need to both go there.Katy (trans woman), on the contrary, felt apprehen-sive about the VA. However, because hormonal ther-apy was becoming too much of a financial burden,she finally made an appointment to enroll:I haven’t been brave enough to venture into that yet but Ithink I’m getting close. I’ve got an appointment on Fridayso we will see. Paying for hormones out of pocket is gettingvery expensive and I think I’m going to see what the VAcan do for me.Donna (trans woman) stated ‘‘I’ve never soughttreatment at the VA related to my gender identity’’while Paul (trans man) said ‘‘I don’t have anything todo with the veteran’s administration and that’s mychoice.’’ Michelle (trans woman) stated that she didnot use the VA because ‘‘I do not trust them.’’ Jenny(trans woman) chose to use her own private physicianrather than use the VA for her healthcare:I don’t use the VA healthcare system. All my private physi-cians know about my transition and I’ve never had anythingbut positive reactions with no change in my healthcare quality.What this dialogue illustrates is that some transgenderveterans are not getting all of the treatment that theyneed and they do not appear to have full confidencethat the VA is a reliable source of healthcare. There is aneed for more community-based research that brings to-gether the transgender community and VA staff so as to‘‘diminish prejudice, reduce stigmatization, and encouragetransgender veterans to obtain needed healthcare.’’18 Pro-grams such as SCAN-ECHO and e-consultation are justtwo ways that the VA is educating providers about trans-gender care. However, some of the comments made byour participants illustrate the necessity of ensuring thatprograms such as these continue to be developed to pro-vide a comprehensive approach to transgender care needswithin the VA.DiscussionWhen it comes to the issue of gender identity, thequestion remains as to why the VA provides sometreatments for transgender veterans while excludingothers. Whether or not transgender people shouldbe allowed to have SRS and other transition-relatedprocedures has been questioned not just by the VAbut began back in the 1960s when Johns Hopkins be-came the first academic institution to perform SRS.24As some of our participants illustrate, getting thetransgender care can still be a struggle for them.When asked what policy changes should be addedand/or eliminated, our participants made severalrecommendations. Amy (trans woman) suggestedthat full treatment, to include SRS, would help to re-duce anxiety.I think it would behoove them (the VA) to provide for reas-signment surgery because the cost would outweigh the costsof treating the individual for a number of suicide attemptsand mental health issues.Robin (trans woman) commented that ‘‘retired per-sonnel should have insurance coverage and access tothe full spectrum of transgender healthcare’’ throughDietert, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2016.004041Tricare while Jenny (trans woman) mentioned that itwas important to ‘‘allow transgender vets the same ac-cess and rights to services as all other vets.’’ These rec-ommendations indicate that many of our participantswere concerned that all treatments to include SRS bemade available to transgender veterans. Otherwise, in-adequate healthcare will continue to be an issue.Transfriendly doctors and staff who can address anarray of medical issues were important for participantsin this study. Some of our respondents elected not toutilize the VA for their healthcare needs and othershave been less than satisfied with the care they have re-ceived in that system. The general consensus amongthe people in our study was that medical practitionerswho are familiar with and open to working with trans-gender people is a key factor in seeking out treatmentfrom the VA or other healthcare institutions. When atransgender patient sees a doctor who is not informedor does not care about their unique needs, impropertreatment may result in ongoing health consequences.For military veterans, unequal medical treatment isnot only unethical but it also amounts to a brokenpromise to people who served their country.The average age of participants in our study was 50.Their collective years of service were 237 and most hadat least some college education. There was one intersexrespondent, 16 trans women, and 5 trans men. Althoughthe sample is too small to generalize to the broader trans-gender veteran population, the comments we receivedindicate that the VA should be an important health re-source for anyone who has served in the military. Eventhough not all transgender veterans in our sample utilizethe VA for healthcare, the data we collected reflect manyof the same concerns relative to comprehensive and in-clusive medical care for transgender veterans in othersimilar studies.10In ongoing attempts to address concerns of trans-gender and intersex veterans, the VHA publishedDirective 2013-003 to establish policy regarding deliv-ery of healthcare to transgender and intersex veteransenrolled in the VA healthcare system. Although thiswas a step in the right direction, more must be doneto ensure that veterans get the healthcare they need.Along with denying SRS, the VA should also considerother treatments necessary to complete the transitionprocess such as electrolysis and reconstructive surgery.The limitations of the study are attributed to the useof purposive and snowball sampling techniques, whichdo not require random sampling; therefore, the find-ings cannot be generalized to all transgender veterans.More specifically, this sample of transgender veterans isnot representative of the transgender population interms of race and ethnicity, class, disability, and agedue to the small sample size. Since the time of our in-terviews, another important limitation that should bementioned is that our participants were interviewedfrom August 5, 2012, to July 15, 2013. AlthoughVHA Directive 2011-024 was in place when some ofthe interviews were conducted, the new VHA Directive2013-003 was released by the Department of VeteransAffairs on February 8, 2013, to ensure that adequatehealthcare is provided to transgender veterans. There-fore, the data reflect a time before and shortly afterthe 2013 directive was released. Since the time of ourinterviews, more has been done by the VHA to im-prove healthcare services for transgender veterans.25However, as mentioned above, there are still no pro-visions for SRS services or reconstructive surgery; bothimportant elements in the bigger picture of transgenderhealthcare. This may change in the near future sincethe Department of Veterans Affairs is currently consid-ering providing SRS to transgender veterans.26 If ap-proved, this new rule would replace VHA Directive2013-003, alleviating some of the issues faced bymany of the participants in our study.ConclusionMedical doctors and other healthcare providers agreethat transgender individuals who receive the fullspectrum of services experience better quality of lifethan those who do not.16 Even though Directive2013-003 does not currently support the full spec-trum of transgender care for those seeking SRS andother surgical treatments necessary to complete tran-sition, the VA has made some significant headway inrecent years in treatment protocols and policies fortransgender patients. For instance, there is now Vet-erans Care Coordinators located at VA facilities thatsupport LGBT programs. The Department of Veter-ans Affairs lists the websites of 28 VA facilities withLGBT programs in several states.27 Providing such pro-grams ensures that LGBT veterans have a supportiveand safe environment when seeking the care thatthey need. Two additional VA clinics that specializein transgender care have also recently opened in Cleve-land, Ohio, and Tucson, Arizona. Like the larger clinicsand medical centers in the VHA system, these clinicsdo not provide SRS and other surgical treatments re-lated to transition. Therefore, bureaucratic powersof governance must continue to re-evaluate policyDietert, et al.; Transgender Health 2017, 2.1http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/trgh.2016.004042limitations set forth by Directive 2013-003. While theclinic in Tucson serves >100 transgender veterans,some VA hospitals continue to turn away transgenderveterans. Policy changes can and will result in betterhealthcare along with incentives for transgender veter-ans to use VA facilities.28The VA also provides trainings to VHA staff regard-ing LGBT healthcare.29 As mentioned earlier in this ar-ticle, SCAN-ECHO and e-consultation have been verysuccessful in delivering training on transgender careto practitioners. The VA also focuses on outreach toLGBT veterans, which is also a step in the right direc-tion.30 At this time, the Department of Veterans Affairsis considering providing SRS to transgender veterans.This new ‘‘rule’’ would remove barriers to transition-related care. The review process could take up to 22months.26 If approved, this new rule would replaceVHA Directive 2013-003, alleviating some of the issuesfaced by many of the participants in our study.With regard to further research, as military organiza-tions begin to re-evaluate their policies, more transgen-der service members will come out of the shadows. Thisaffords an opportunity for increased dialogue with re-searchers about personal experiences with the VA andthe military in general. Considering the time frame inwhich our data were collected, more has been done toimprove VHA relationships with LGBT veterans. TheVHA has made and continues to make system changesthat advance LGBT inclusiveness and clinical compe-tence.31 However, we suggest that one key area of im-portance should continue to focus on how mentalhealth and medical providers and ancillary staff aretrained to interact with and provide care for their trans-gender patients. As our participant Donna (transwoman) so eloquently states, the VHA ‘‘needs to haveclear cut policies to ensure that trans veterans are re-ceiving fair treatment and are being treated with dignityand respect.’’ With 84% (96 of 114) of all VHA clinicsachieving Leadership Status in the 2016 Human RightsCampaign’s Healthcare Equality Index (HEI), perhapsthe end of bureaucratic, rational calculation is insight.31 As our data illustrate, transgender veteranshave a great deal of knowledge and experiences toshare with the VHA that can contribute to shaping cur-rent and future polices as these relate to their care.Whenever change occurs, especially in large bureau-cratic organizations such as the U.S. military, it is par-ticularly important for social researchers to continuecollecting and recording empirical data in an effort toensure that progress continues and does not stall.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Brynn Tannehill for sharing her in-sights with us early in the development of this project.They also thank the people who shared their storieswith them.

    "abstract": "Purpose: There is a gap in social science literature addressing issues of access and quality of care for transgender military veterans. Psychologists, medical doctors, and other health professionals are beginning to address some of the barriers present in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) system that affect veterans who are also transgender and intersex. Over a 7-year period, between 2006 and 2013, 2600 transgender veterans were served by the VA. Data from several surveys revealed that most transgender veterans perceive the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to be less than accommodating for their special needs. The goal of this study was to investigate the experiences of a sample of transgender veterans with regard to their experiences with healthcare services provided by the VHA.\nMethods: Using snowball sampling techniques, we were able to recruit 22 transgender military veterans to participate in our study. A combination of telephone interviews and questionnaires provided data from veterans in various branches of the military throughout the United States.\nResults: Findings indicate that even though the VHA is working to address issues of inequality for transgender veterans, our participants indicated that there are still some problems with administration of care, proper training of staff and physicians, and availability of comprehensive services for the unique healthcare needs of transgender individuals.\nConclusion: Since our data were collected, the VA has worked to bridge the gap by focusing on increased training for VHA providers and staff and establishing LGBT programs at VA facilities. However, we suggest that one key area of importance should continue to focus on how mental health and medical providers and ancillary staff are trained to interact with and provide care for their transgender patients",
