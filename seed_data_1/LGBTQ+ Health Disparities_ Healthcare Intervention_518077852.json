LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  1       LGBTQ+ Health Disparities: Healthcare Intervention  Kara Steinbrecher Eleanor Mann School of Nursing University of Arkansas   LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  2 ABSTRACT The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) community has carried the burden of countless health disparities throughout its history tied to discrimination, bias, prejudice, and stigma. LGBTQ+ individuals are disproportionately at higher risk for substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, cardiovascular disease, mental illness, suicide, and unequal access to healthcare, related to social stigma and bias that exists in healthcare itself. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to analyze existing health disparities among the LGBTQ+ population in the United States and the efficacy of various interventions of health care professionals to reduce them. Twenty-one articles from multiple online databases investigating existing LGBTQ+ health inequities and healthcare professional interventions were chosen according to keywords and inclusion criteria specific to the research question presented. Each of the selected articles were separated into two major themes: existing health care disparities of LGBTQ+ individuals and interventions taken by healthcare professionals. The second theme of healthcare intervention can be divided into three subcategories: addition of cultural competence education to training of healthcare staff, implementation of sexual orientation and gender identity data into electronic health records, and initiation of LGBTQ+-specific therapies. The prevalence and root of health inequalities impacting the LGBTQ+ community has proved to be multifaceted indicating the need for several approaches to intervention for reducing the incidence of these disparities and improving patient outcomes of the LGBTQ+ community.   LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  3 INTRODUCTION  LGBTQ+ individuals account for 5-10% of the United States population (Pirschel, 2020), approximately 11 million adults (Caceres et al., 2020). The term LGBTQ+ is composed of a multitude of factors related to sexual orientation as well as gender identity and gender expression. Understanding the health of this population cannot occur without context of historical factors that have contributed to the inequalities LGBTQ+ individuals face today.  Advocation of LGBTQ+ rights can be traced back to the Stonewall riots of 1969, often referred to as a “catalyst for LGBT movement for civil rights in the United States” (Human Rights News, 2009). Being openly gay during this time period was extremely dangerous considering several states had implemented laws against public homosexuality resulting in frequent raids of businesses, organizations, restaurants, and bars that were known to accommodate LGBTQ+ patrons. One of these raids occurred at Stonewall Inn in New York, a popular bar catered to the LGBTQ+ community in Greenwich Village. Patrons were harassed by police until a riot ensued, sparking the movement known today as “Pride.” Protests continued outside Stonewall Inn as the movement grew and gay rights activist groups developed in nearly every state (Human Rights News, 2009).  Forty years have passed since the Stonewall riots, and the US has made strides towards equality for the LGBTQ+ community including repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” in 2010, legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015 (Public Broadcasting Service, n.d.), and implementation of the Equality Act in 2019 (Gonzales & Gavulic, 2020). Despite the progress the LGBTQ+ community has made in advocating for their civil rights, there is an undeniable disparity in LGBTQ+ health that still exists in present day. The LGBTQ+ population was officially defined as a health disparity by National Institutes of Health’s Gender Minority LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  4 Research Office in 2016 (Caceres et al., 2020). These ever-growing disparities with ties to historical discrimination, bias, and prejudice can be attributed to minority stress, “a term that encompasses stressful situations and experiences due to one’s race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and/or gender identity” (Powell, 2021, para. 2). The Minority Stress Model originated from studies of LGBTQ+ individuals early in the 2000s (Powell, 2021). Types of minority stress include victimization, discrimination, heteronormative cultural norms, stereotyping and prejudice, and systematic bias (Powell, 2021). As a result of experiencing minority stress, individuals are placed more at risk for mental health disorders, substance abuse, lack of emotional support, high blood pressure, obesity, insomnia, heart disease, and poor coping mechanisms, adding to increasing disparities in this population (Powell, 2021).  A literature review addressing specific health disparities among the LGBTQ+ population will be beneficial in understanding their root causes, as well as what interventions by healthcare professionals will be efficient in promoting a decrease in inequal health outcomes. Results of this review may be applied to nursing practice in an effort to continue taking action to reduce health disparities among the LGBTQ+ community and serve LGBTQ+ patients as advocates for their health and civil rights. There are gaps in literature that must be addressed to indicate a need for research beyond this review, including several articles include studies with small sample sizes that could skew presentation and significance of data as well as a lack of general research regarding actions taken by healthcare professionals to improve health outcomes for the LGBTQ+ community. After accounting for articles discussing specific health disparities of the LGBTQ+ community, only half address intervention by healthcare. Significant research is required to further assess the impact of various healthcare interventions on reduction of LGBTQ+ health inequalities. LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  5 Research Question Upon analyzing specific health disparities that exist among LGBTQ+ individuals, what healthcare interventions will ultimately improve patient outcomes and reduce these health disparities of LGBTQ+ individuals compared to standard care and nursing practice? METHODS  In this review, twenty-one articles relating to this research question were analyzed. Three searches were conducted using three separate databases and specific keywords pertaining to LGBTQ+ health disparities and interventions of healthcare professionals. This review has also been conducted with consideration of PRISMA guidelines for clarification. Search Strategy Using the University of Arkansas online libraries, an electronic search was conducted on the databases CINAHL, Academic Complete, and MEDLINE/PubMed. The literature was limited to full text articles published from January 2015 through November 2021 written in English. The keywords ‘LGBTQ+’, ‘health disparities’, ‘cultural competence,’ and ‘education’ were used in the search of each database.  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  Articles were excluded from the review based on their relevance to the research being conducted. Articles that were not based in the United States, not written in English, or published before 2015 were excluded. Articles that did not specifically address LGBTQ+ health disparities or the role of healthcare in combating LGBTQ+ healthcare inequality were also excluded from review.  Data Extraction LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  6  Data was independently extracted from the articles based on relevance to research. Data chosen for inclusion in this review includes the setting of the study (i.e., city, state, or community), the sample size of the study, major variables studied, measurement, the purpose of the study, and key findings of each article. Figure 1 illustrates the method of selecting articles for review through eliminating duplicate articles, discarding articles with exclusion criteria, and assessing eligible articles based on relevance to research. A combined total of 262 results from each database were examined for review eligibility. After duplicate articles were removed from consideration upon cross-referencing database results, 176 results remained. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the remaining articles resulting in the discard of 145 more results. Of the thirty-one articles that were deemed eligible for review, only twenty-one were included in the final review due to relative lack of content relevant to the purpose of the review. Figure 1.  Flow chart of search strategy, data exclusion, and article selection via searches on CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, and MEDLINE/PubMed.   LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  7 RESULTS Of all the articles selected for review, two main themes emerged during their analysis. The first is the prevalence and root causes of health disparities among the LGBTQ+ community. The second is interventions healthcare professionals could be responsible for in order to reduce the health disparities discussed. These interventions can be divided into three subcategories: cultural competency education in training of healthcare staff, implementation of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data into electronic health records as routine practice, LGBTQ+ specific therapies and programs for sexual and gender minority patients. Of the articles discussing healthcare intervention, 36% discuss culturally competent care, 45% discuss implementation of SOGI data into EHR, and 19% discuss therapies and programs specific to LGBTQ+ health. The articles addressing health disparities among the LGBTQ+ community focus primarily on their root cause. The articles show evidence of health disparities existing because of social factors causing minority stress such as household dysfunction (Baams, 2018), lack of education in sexual practices and sexual health information (Charest et al., 2016), limited healthcare access, bias and discrimination in healthcare (Pirschel, 2020) (Casey et al., 2019), discrimination in education, employment, etc. (Gonzales & Gavulic, 2020), bullying and sexual harassment (Hatchel et al., 2018), and even vulnerability related to the COVID-19 pandemic (Salerno et al., 2020). Existing Health Disparities An article important to include in this review written by Gonzales and Gavulic discusses the Equality Act of 2019. Only 15 states have implemented legal protection in compliance with this Act, leaving LGBTQ+ residents of the remaining 35 states vulnerable to discrimination in housing, education, and employment that further add to health disparities in this population LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  8 (Gonzales & Gavulic, 2020). In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, evidence shows the LGBTQ+ population was disproportionally affected (Salerno et al., 2020). According to the article by Salerno et al., 40% of LGBTQ+ individuals work in the service industry, the primary industry negatively impacted by the pandemic. Stay at home orders cost those in the service industry their jobs as well as health insurance benefits (Salerno et al., 2020). In addition, stay at orders had the potential to keep LGBTQ+ youth at home in unsafe households without access to school’s mental health services (Salerno et al., 2019). These incidences further placed the LGBTQ+ individuals at risk for further minority stress leading to health disparities. A survey completed among high schoolers in Minnesota assess the prevalence of household dysfunction and/or child abuse such as addiction, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. Results of the survey showed a disparity in these adverse childhood events among male and female LGBTQ+ adolescents compared to their heterosexual peers (Baams, 2018). A questionnaire assessing LGBTQ+ adults between the ages of 18-25 assessed their access to educational sources regarding sexual health and practices as well as incidences of sexual violence. The results of the study show that LGBTQ+ young adults are twice as likely as their heterosexual counterparts to have sex while intoxicated and have a higher rate of sexual violence. LGBTQ+ participants of this study also report a lack of reliable sources to provide adequate education about LGBTQ+ sexual health risks and behaviors, with most respondents obtaining their sexual health knowledge from unreliable sources such as pornography and social media (Charest et al., 2016).  Another study addresses the prevalence of bullying and sexual harassment through surveying of 404 LGBTQ+ high school students across the US. Results showed a significant portion of respondents having experienced bullying and sexual harassment related to sexual orientation and gender identity, leading to increased feelings of isolation, LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  9 symptoms of mental illness, and decreased sense of belonging at school (Hatchel et al., 2018). In 2019, a study completed by Goodin et al. sought out to determine health disparities among LGBTQ+ youth related to alcohol use, mental illnesses, and support. 2,577 participants as young as twelve years old from high schools in Kentucky were surveyed about their history with alcohol use and symptoms of poor mental health as well as the presence of an adult emotional support system to rely on. Results of the study showed LGBTQ+-identifying students had reported increased alcohol use, increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, and decreased prevalence of a trusted adult to confide in (Goodin et al., 2019). These articles highlight health disparities among LGBTQ+ youth related to bullying, sexual assault, lack of education related to sexual health, and lack of support at home. The health disparities as a result of these social factors are increased alcohol abuse, increased mental illness, and increased suicidal ideation at very young ages. Other evidence shows that health inequalities experienced at these young ages have detrimental effects on LGBTQ+ individuals throughout adulthood (Hafeez et al., 2017). Several other articles included in this review discuss LGBTQ+ health in adulthood such as poor cardiovascular health (Caceres et al., 2020), sexual transmitted diseases such as HIV (Shover et al., 2018), and cancer (Pirschel, 2020). The article by Caceres et. al explains evidence of LGBTQ+-identifying adults experiencing more cases of poor cardiovascular health, indicating the need for further research about what data exists about LGBTQ+ cardiovascular health and methods for improvement. LGBTQ+ stressors that lead to an increase in poor cardiovascular health includes general life stressors such as finances and work as well as institutional stress from lack of legal protection and social stigma, interpersonal stress from personal experience of discrimination and violence related to sexual orientation and gender identity, and intrapersonal stress from stigma, expectations and the coming-out process (Caceres et al., 2020). Physiological LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  10 risk factors for cardiovascular disease that affect LGBTQ+ individuals disproportionally include HIV, dyslipidemia, obesity, and tobacco use. LGBTQ+ individuals are credited with more use of tobacco, increased risk for obesity and diabetes, and HIV (Caceres et al., 2020). According to Shover et. al, transgender women, nonbinary individuals, gay men, and bisexual men are at an increased risk for acquiring HIV (Shover et al., 2018). Incidences of cancer are high among LGBTQ+ individuals due to higher self-reported occurrences of binge-drinking and tobacco use as well as negative experiences in healthcare that deter this population from receiving treatment (Pirschel, 2020).  Poor health outcomes highlighted in these articles attribute negative healthcare experiences. In a study conducted by Carpenter in 2021, twenty-two queer women and gender nonconforming adults were personally interviewed about their experiences with healthcare professionals during routine reproductive care. Respondents report relying heavily on online communities for information about LGBTQ+ sexual health, similar to results of the study performed by Charest et al. (Carpenter, 2021). One participant states, “It’s not like when you go to a fertility clinic, they have some sort of workshop where they explain all that to you” (Carpenter, 2021). Participants also reported feeling vulnerable to discrimination and stigma during care when disclosing their sexual orientation and gender identity. Another participant states, “I lie to most of my medical providers if I think that I need to get the type of medical care that I need. . . I will really play up my white, straight, middle-class persona. . . because it feels like I have to in order to get them to take me seriously… It is messed up that I’m not honest with my own doctors. . . . I just felt like it wasn’t an option if I wanted to get the care I wanted. Even though I was seeking reproductive health, I was downplaying the fact that I’m sexually active, and not disclosing that I was bi, not disclosing that I was poly, not disclosing that I had had an LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  11 abortion” (Carpenter, 2021). In another study of 273 LGBTQ+ cancer patients, similar sentiments were shared by participants through an anonymous online survey. Respondents report feeling the need to be their own advocates for their health, only disclosing sexual orientation and gender identity when feeling safe, and generally negative experiences upon disclosure of SOGI (Kamen et al., 2018). In a study of 3,453 LGBT-identifying adults, 18% reported avoidance of healthcare based on fear of negative experiences, and 16% reported discrimination during routine healthcare (Casey et al., 2019). The results of this study also include evidence of discrimination outside of healthcare. 57% of participants reporting threats or harassment related to sexual orientation or gender identity, 51% reported them or someone they knew experienced sexual assault or violence, 57% reported being called slurs, and 53% reported being victims of microaggression (Casey et al., 2019).  Healthcare Intervention Culturally Competent Healthcare A large percentage of articles in this review analyze health disparities among LGBTQ+ individuals with several discussing intervention by healthcare to reduce them. Implementation of culturally competent care education in training of healthcare professionals is a major theme among articles discussing intervention. A study completed in 2019 assessed the efficacy of modules presented to postgraduate medical students in 120 different residency programs in understanding LGBTQ+ health, terminology, and risks (Streed et al., 2019). Within the study, 1,018 tests were given to 833 postgraduate students to assess their knowledge before and after presentation of information from modules addressing LGBTQ+ health and culturally specific care. The ‘pretests’ showed a lack of knowledge regarding prevalence of STIs, substance abuse, and mental illness in this population. Scores of the ‘posttest’ following the module showed a LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  12 drastic increase in overall knowledge of LGBTQ+ health and culturally specific care. Year 1 students scored an average of 52.09% on the pretest and 80.20% average on the posttest, indicating the modules presented were effective in increasing knowledge of LGBTQ+ health and culturally appropriate care (Streed et al., 2019). A similar study was completed at University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine in 2020 when 83 first-year medical students were presented with a module about culturally competent care, intersectionality, and LGBTQ+ health (Bi et al., 2020). The module included five 10–15-minute testimonies of lived experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, a two-hour “safe-space” training, a 30-minute lecture, and a 90-minute discussion followed by a 30-minute Q&A session. Once again, the scores from pretest and posttest showed drastic improvement, indicating success of the seminar in improving knowledge of LGBTQ+ health and culturally competent care (Bi et al., 2020). In 2015, 632 adults were surveyed as part of a study in analyzing attitudes, experiences, and health knowledge of LGBTQ+ individuals during routine care (Quinn et al., 2015). This anonymous online survey was composed of 60 questions asking about attitudes regarding healthcare, positive and negative experiences during care, and suggestions for improvement. 289 participants reported wanting healthcare professional’s knowledge of LGBTQ+ health and culturally appropriate care to be improved, 45.7% of respondents. Results of this study indicate a significant need for further research regarding hospital policy and need for implementation of training on LGBTQ+ appropriate care (Quinn et al., 2015). An article written in 2021 by Ruedas et al. discusses LGBTQ+ health disparities in Jacksonville, FL and St. Vincent Family Medicine Center’s formation of an advocate team to encourage didactic sessions, case-based learning, panels, and modules about LGBTQ+ health. The need for these interventions was reported being necessary at this institution due to overwhelming disparities in the health of LGBTQ+ patients including a higher risk for LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  13 UTIs related to avoidance of using public restrooms, tobacco use, alcohol use, homelessness, isolation, lack of access to social services, suicide, STDs, and mental illness (Ruedas et al., 2021). According to members of the advocate team, the goal of implementing training about culturally appropriate care is to make providers feel comfortable with and competent in caring for LGBTQ+ patients so they will feel supported and encouraged to seek out healthcare, ultimately reducing the significant of health inequalities in these patients (Ruedas et al., 2021).  Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Documentation Several articles in this review discuss the importance of implementing SOGI into electronic health records (EHR). An article written in 2019 by Grasso et al., analyzes research regarding standard documentation of SOGI into EHR to investigate its potential to improve health outcomes and improved patient experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals (Grasso et al., 2019). According to the article, 78-80% of healthcare providers reported thinking patients would be offended by assessing SOGI or thought patients would refuse to answer, while only 3-11% of LGBTQ+ patients reported offense or refusal to disclose. The article reports routine collection of SOGI data at registration of hospital clinics could be beneficial (Grasso et al., 2019). Another article written in 2019 by Maragh-Bass analyzes implementation of SOGI data into EHR. According to the article, guidelines from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend incorporating SOGI data into EHR, yet approximately 75% of SO data and 65% of GI data is not included in EHR for patients across the US (Maragh-Bass, 2019). The article hypothesizes that providers will rely on stereotypes to assume a person’s sexual minority status rather than standardizing the assessment of SOGI information to document into EHR. The article discusses there is a lack of training of providers that may lead to biases and offensive patient interactions such as misgendering patients and not providing comprehensive care. A quote from LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  14 the article states, “the puzzle is incomplete if it is based on one piece; therefore, SGM status must not be a shortcut for minimizing patients into risk factors rather than maximizing their unique and intersectional identities” (Maragh-Bass, 2019, para. 12). Knowing a patient’s sexual orientation and gender identity is a key piece to eliminating health disparities for LGBTQ+ patients by recognizing them as unique persons with diverse experiences and identities to provide the best possible care unique to them (Maragh-Bass, 2019). Shover et. al also discusses implementation of SOGI data into EHR as an effort to reduce the percentage of LGBTQ+ patients with HIV, viral hepatitis, and other STDs. The article states, “Collecting and reporting SOGI data are critical to achieving national health goals” (Shover et al., 2019). Caceres et. al also discusses that a lack of SOGI data serves as a barrier to research about LGBTQ+ health, indicating further evidence towards supporting the incorporation of SOGI data into EHR as a way of further determining the significance LGBTQ+ health disparities and taking measures to reduce them (Caceres et al., 2020). Conversely, a study by Rossman et. al in 2017 demonstrates adult LGBTQ+ patients with hesitancy to SOGI disclosure (Rossman et al., 2017).  206 LGBT-identifying participants living near Chicago were given an open-ended questionnaire to assess their reasoning for or against disclosing SOGI to healthcare professionals. 37% of participants reported not sharing their sexual orientation or gender identity to healthcare professionals for reasons including lack of inquiry by the provider and not seeing SOGI relevant to healthcare (Rossman et al., 2017).  LGBTQ+ Specific Care Two articles addressed programs and therapies geared towards LGBTQ+ adults as a means to improve health disparities in this community. A study by Valentine et. al in 2021 analyzes the efficacy of veteran care coordinators (VCC) in caring for LGBTQ+ patients at VHA LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  15 facilities (Valentine et al., 2021). 79 VCCs were surveyed about the progress of the program in aiding LGBT-identifying veterans and providing LGBTQ+ affirming care. Results showed the biggest barriers to the program were a lack of resources, poor communication among VCCs and residents, and engagement (Valentine et al., 2021). Another study conducted in 2019 addresses the effectiveness of a therapy geared towards LGBTQ+ patients in New York City, NY and Miami, FL. 25,018 gay and bisexual men diagnosed with depression and anxiety were given a therapy entitled Effective Skills to Empower Effective Men (ESTEEM) which works to regulate emotions, reduce avoidance patterns, and improve motivation to adhere to health behaviors (Pachankis, 2019). The purpose of the study was to evaluate how beneficial ESTEEM therapy is in reducing health risks related to minority stress. In the pilot study, there was a 60% decrease in condomless sex in men using ESTEEM for six months (Pachankis, 2019).  The characteristics of these articles can be found summarized in Table 1.

LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  20 DISCUSSION Summary of Findings  The authors of the articles reviewed discuss various health disparities of the LGBTQ+ community as well as interventions by healthcare that have potential to reduce them. The evidence in this literature review illustrates the multifaceted chain reaction that occurs as a result of minority stress leading to disproportionately poor health among the LGBTQ+ community with significant historical prejudice, discrimination, violence, and systematic bias at its core. LGBTQ+ individuals are more likely to experience sexual assault, discrimination in education, housing, and employment, bullying, and adverse events in the home that contribute to minority stress. For example, bullying and harassment related to LGBTQ+ status causes internalized stress that leads affected individuals to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as binge drinking, tobacco use, and unsafe sex practices. These coping mechanisms serve as a means for developing poor health outcomes that add to a growing disparity in health of the LGBTQ+ community. Increased tobacco use places individuals at higher risk for developing cancer and cardiovascular disease, and unsafe sex practices places individuals at higher risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV, viral hepatitis, chlamydia, etc. Another contribution to health disparities in this population is the lack of resources for LGBTQ+ individuals to educate themselves on safe sex practices, leading to more incidences of HIV and other STDs. The literature shows a correlation between lack of general and sexual health knowledge, poor health outcomes, and fear of experiencing further discrimination when seeking healthcare. Articles addressing LGBTQ+ patient experiences highlight the risk of patients refusing to seek out healthcare in fear of experiencing discrimination by healthcare professionals. LGBTQ+ patients are also hesitant to disclose sexual orientation and gender identity for these reasons, limiting the extent to which LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  21 care can be provided for these patients. Participants of studies in this review comment on lack of knowledge of LGBTQ+ care by providers, harassment, and refusal of treatment that add to unequal health outcomes in the LGBTQ+ community.   Several participants of studies within this review request the implementation of culturally competent education in training of healthcare providers. The articles showed success in increasing student knowledge of LGBTQ+ health and patient care, indicating a need for further implementation of modules, didactic exams, panels, discussions, and testimonies regarding LGBTQ+ health, experiences, and patient care to further ensure healthcare professional competence in caring for LGBTQ+ patients. This intervention may further reduce health disparities that exist in this population. Incorporation of SOGI into EHR was also a recurring theme in healthcare intervention. Standardized assessment of every patient’s sexual orientation and gender identity is thought to be an intervention by healthcare that will allow providers to fully understand a patient’s unique identity, health risks associated with sexual minority status, and obtain more data about LGBTQ+ health to be used in further research of LGBTQ+ health disparities. Each article addressing SOGI in EHR discusses the potential for improving health outcomes of LGBTQ+ patients. However, in other articles in this review, patients are not always comfortable with sharing SOGI information as a result of past negative experiences in healthcare, including discrimination, bias, and stereotyping. This indicates an even further need to improve the competency of healthcare professionals when caring for LGBTQ+, putting an end to active discrimination in healthcare and making patients feel safe disclosing their identities. Although few articles discussed specific therapies and programs for LGBQT+ patients, there is a significant indication for reduction of poor health outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals with continued use. LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  22  Systematic societal change is necessary before interventions presented may serve to reduce poor health outcomes for LGBTQ+ individuals. Evidence in this review suggests efficacy of these interventions, but with external societal factors at the heart of poor LGBTQ+ health, time and generational healing may prove to be the most significant aspect of change. Figure 2 illustrates the interconnections between health disparity causes according to evidence within review.             Figure 2. Web diagram illustrating connections between causes of prevalent health disparities among LGBTQ+ community.   Study Limitations  Limitations in the studies reviewed include small sample sizes, unclear methods of sample selection, and lack of research related to studies conducted. This review only contains 21 articles, although there are remaining articles relevant to this content that were not found through LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  23 this review’s search methods. This indicates a need for more research to gather evidence to further support implementation of this content into practice. This review also covers a broad range of topics related to LGBTQ+ health and healthcare intervention. Further research dedicated to a specific disparity or specific intervention is necessary to fully understand and evaluate these results. Gaps in Literature  Only two articles included discuss a program or therapy that could be used to reduce health disparities, indicating a need for more research regarding LGBTQ+ specific therapy, treatments, etc. that could reduce the incidence of poor health outcomes. More research about specific about LGBTQ+ patient health after standardized data collection of SOGI is necessary to determine its effectiveness in reducing health disparities in this population. Similarly, more research is needed among facilities with active implementation of cultural competency programs such as didactic modules to assess its long-term effectiveness of reducing LGBTQ+ health disparities.  Implications for Nursing Practice  This review provides several implications for the role of an RN. Evidence in this study shows that healthcare disparities among the LGBTQ+ have the potential to be reduced by measures taken in healthcare policy, but RNs also have the power to take control into their own hands. Cultural competence has been reported to improve patient comfort during care, thus creating a sense of security during care that will encourage routine medical appoints that aid in reducing inequal health problems. Cultural competence education in training of RNs is the focus of the articles in this review, however cultural competence can also be an independent character growth that may improve patient care on a much smaller scale. Pursuing continued education LGBTQ+ HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION  24 about cultural competency and care of LGBTQ+ patients is available to those who seek it, not necessarily only provided in structured courses through hospital orientations, for example.   Nurses care for their patients physically, mentally, and emotionally with advocacy at its center. Advocacy in this case includes understanding the historical context of health disparities of the LGBTQ+ community and taking measures to implement policy changes such as incorporating SOGI data in EHRs, standardizing therapies specific to LGBTQ+ patients, and cultural competence education for healthcare staff, as evidenced by this review.

    "abstract": "The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) community has carried the burden of countless health disparities throughout its history tied to discrimination, bias, prejudice, and stigma. LGBTQ+ individuals are disproportionately at higher risk for substance abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, cardiovascular disease, mental illness, suicide, and unequal access to healthcare, related to social stigma and bias that exists in healthcare itself. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to analyze existing health disparities among the LGBTQ+ population in the United States and the efficacy of various interventions of health care professionals to reduce them. Twenty-one articles from multiple online databases investigating existing LGBTQ+ health inequities and healthcare professional interventions were chosen according to keywords and inclusion criteria specific to the research question presented. Each of the selected articles were separated into two major themes: existing health care disparities of LGBTQ+ individuals and interventions taken by healthcare professionals. The second theme of healthcare intervention can be divided into three subcategories: addition of cultural competence education to training of healthcare staff, implementation of sexual orientation and gender identity data into electronic health records, and initiation of LGBTQ+-specific therapies. The prevalence and root of health inequalities impacting the LGBTQ+ community has proved to be multifaceted indicating the need for several approaches to intervention for reducing the incidence of these disparities and improving patient outcomes of the LGBTQ+ community",
