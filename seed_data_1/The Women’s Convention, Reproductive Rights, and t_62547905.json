The traditionalist explanation focuses on women’s reproductive capacity and sees in motherhood woman’s chief goal in life . . . . Thus the sexual division of labor based on biological differences is seen as functional and just.1 —Gerda Lerner, The Creation of Patriarchy, 16-17 INTRODUCTION President Barack Obama has asked Senator John Kerry, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to move forward on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women2 (“CEDAW” or the “Women’s Convention”),3 which President Jimmy Carter signed in 1978.4  This Article focuses on the consequences of ratification for reproductive rights.  Under CEDAW, I argue, the United States would be required to fully assure these rights, including subsidized family planning services and abortion. Part I of this Article describes CEDAW’s broad prohibition against what I call ‘the reproduction of gender,’ including the “sexual division of labor based on biological differences” that historian Gerda Lerner5 and other feminist   * Professor of Law and John DeWitt Gregory Research Scholar, Hofstra Law School.

Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM 262 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 18:261 2011 scholars identify as the bedrock for women’s subordination.6  Part II explains why the denial of reproductive rights necessarily reproduces gender hierarchy, whether by the state or by non-state actors.  Part III explains how this plays out, internationally and in the United States.  It does so by drawing on recent work regarding the fragmentation of international law.  This fragmentation has led to the proliferation of national applications.  It then situates this law in U.S. constitutional jurisprudence, showing how the argument set out in this Article resonates with the arguments of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Professors Sylvia Law, Reva Siegel and others, to ground reproductive rights in equality, rather than privacy.  Efforts to do so under the U.S. Constitution have failed.  As this Article demonstrates, CEDAW provides equality on steroids, equality that can do the work necessary to assure reproductive rights. It should be noted that many American proponents of CEDAW oppose my argument.  Rather, it is their view that CEDAW does not require support for family planning services and is “abortion neutral.”7  Indeed, pro-life opponents of ratification argue, as I do, that CEDAW requires support for family planning services and abortion.8  I agree, although in my view this is another reason why the United States should ratify CEDAW.   6.

Jaggar, Globalizing Feminist Ethics, HYPATIA, Spring 1998, at 7-31 (1998) (noting consensus among feminists in the developing world that “the abolition of the sexual division of labor [and] freedom of choice over childbearing” are necessary to overcome women’s subordination) (citation omitted); MAJA KIRILOVA ERIKSSON, REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM 166 (2000) (arguing that, “Reproductive freedom is sine qua non for the attainment of any real equality between women and men”); Arvonne S.

Id. at 14 (noting that, “opponents of U.S. ratification argue that . . . [CEDAW] could lead to the abolishment of state parental notification laws, require federal funding for abortions, or obligate the U.S. government to promote and provide access to abortion.”).  I view these arguments as a Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM  THE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER 263 Both positions reflect their proponents’ strategies regarding ratification of CEDAW.9  They may be right, but I am not arguing that the United States should or should not ratify CEDAW, or that relying on CEDAW is or is not a useful strategy for furthering reproductive rights in the United States.  It may well have the opposite effect.10  Rather, my argument is that the Women’s Convention bars the reproduction of gender, which, as a matter of law, requires the assurance of women’s reproductive rights in the United States and everywhere else. I.  THE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER11 A.  Reproductive Rights Under International Law Women’s rights are relatively new in international law.  While the International Bill of Rights12 requires states to treat women and men ‘equally,’  welcome concession, which should facilitate the actual provision of such support following ratification.  As pro-life advocates further observe, “In 1998, for example, the Committee recommended to Mexico that ‘all states . . . should review their legislation so that, where necessary, women are granted access to rapid and easy abortion.’  More recently, in 2007, the Committee urged Poland ‘to ensure that women seeking legal abortion have access to it, and that their access is not limited by the use of the conscientious objection clause.’”  Id. at 15.  9.

[that they] sometimes seem[ ] to cede them the moral high ground . . . [Obama] announce[d] ‘Abortion vexes.’  The opponents of abortion aren’t vexed─ they are mobilized, focused, and driven to succeed.  The Catholic bishops took the lead in pushing for the Stupak amendment, and they squeezed legislators in a way that would do any K Street lobbyist proud.”); see Ann Shalleck, Offspring and Bodies: Dependency and Vulnerability in the Constitutional Jurisprudence of Rights, 77 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 1620, 1621 (2009) (urging a “move . . . beyond the rigid and distorting legal framework of competing maternal and fetal rights that dominates the jurisprudence of and argument surrounding abortion”).  10. See BLANCHFIELD, supra note 7, at 15.  The politics of abortion are complicated. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg viewed Roe v. Wade as a political mistake, for example, which “prolonged divisiveness and deferred stable settlement of the issue.”  Jack M. Balkin, Roe v. Wade: An Engine of Controversy, in WHAT ROE V. WADE SHOULD HAVE SAID 3, 11 (Jack M. Balkin ed., 2005).  Justice William Brennan also thought it would have been wiser to wait and see what the legislatures might do, rather than set out Roe’s trimester framework.  Id. at 10.  More recently, Neal Devins has argued that public opinion drives the law in this context, so public opinion should be addressed before legal reform is attempted.  See generally Neal Devins, How Planned Parenthood v. Casey (Pretty Much) Settled the Abortion Wars, 118 YALE L.J. 1318 (2009).  Reva Siegel has carefully documented the ways in which “constitutional culture channels social movement conflict.”  Reva B. Siegel, Constitutional Culture, Social Movement Conflict, and Constitutional Change: The Case of the De Facto ERA, 94 CALIF. L. REV. 1323, 1323 (2006) (explaining how “equal protection doctrine prohibiting sex discrimination was forged in the Equal Rights Amendment’s defeat”).  See generally Reva B. Siegel, The Right’s Reasons: Constitutional Conflict and the Spread of Woman-Protective Antiabortion Argument, 57 DUKE L.J. 1641 (2008) (documenting how the Right has tailored its arguments to reflect cultural change).  11. This includes the sexual division of labor based on biological differences.  See supra text accompanying notes 5-6.  As explained below, it may extend beyond the sexual division of labor to stereotypes arguably unrelated to it, but which nevertheless signal gender in a particular culture.  For example, in the United States, dressing babies in pink signals that they are girls.  12. This consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A. Res. 217 (III) A, U.N. Doc. A/RES/217(III) (Dec. 10, 1948) [hereinafter Universal Declaration]; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 999 U.N.T.S. 171 [hereinafter Civil Covenant or ICCP]; and the Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM 264 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 18:261 2011 this assumes and confirms a male norm.13  The Covenants and the Universal Declaration protect rights in the public sphere, that is, the rights of individuals in their relations with the state.  Some family rights are recognized,14 but even here the focus is to protect the family from the state, rather than to protect women within the family from men.15  As the Committee responsible for monitoring CEDAW notes, “historically, human activity in public and private life has been viewed differently and regulated accordingly.  In all societies, women who have traditionally performed their roles in the private or domestic sphere have long had those activities treated as inferior.”16 A similar dynamic has been noted in U.S. law, where constitutionally-protected civil and political rights have been championed by men for more than 200 years.  These rights are worth most to those women whose lives are most like men’s.  When women seek “formal” equality, when they demand the same rights as men to freedom of speech, for example, they can rely on well-developed equality jurisprudence.  When women assert reproductive rights, they are in less well-charted territory.  These rights address issues historically and almost universally relegated to the private sphere, left to the determination of the married couple.  Reproductive rights in the United States were first articulated in the 1960s in Griswold v. Connecticut,17 which protected the couple’s freedom from state intrusion in the marital bedroom.  As a practical matter, this reflected and perpetuated women’s subordination within the marriage, since the husband was the decision maker in the traditional couple.18  Reproductive rights were not extended to individuals until Eisenstadt v. Baird19 in 1972.  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 999 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Economic Covenant].  13. This is one reason equality jurisprudence lacks the muscle to assure reproductive rights in the United States.

As explained infra Part III.B., in the United States, privacy doctrine has been widely criticized.  18. LERNER, supra note 1.  Many of the world’s women, including women in the United States, still spend much of their lives in the private sphere of the home and the family.  See General Recommendation No. 21, supra note 16, ¶ 8.  As the Committee further observes: As such activities are invaluable for the survival of society, there can be no justification for applying different and discriminatory laws or customs to them.  Reports of States parties disclose that there are still countries where de jure equality does not exist . . . Even where de jure equality exists, all societies assign different roles, which are regarded as inferior, to women.  In this way, principles of justice and equality contained in particular in article 16 and also in articles 2, 5 and 24 of the Convention are being violated.

The basic concept first appeared in 1968, in the final document approved by the Teheran Conference on Human Rights in 1968:20 “[T]he rights to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have the access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights.”21  But it was not until the World Conference on Population in 1994 (“Cairo Conference”) that reproductive rights were clearly articulated.22  Although convened to address population issues, the participants in the Cairo Conference recognized that: (1) family-planning programs should not involve any form of coercion, (2) government-sponsored economic incentives and disincentives were only marginally effective, and (3) governmental goals “should be defined in terms of unmet needs for information and services,” rather than quotas or targets imposed on service providers.23  The aim “should be to assist couples and individuals to achieve their reproductive goals and give them the full opportunity to exercise the right to have children by choice.”24  The Cairo Conference required states to meet the family planning needs of their populations as soon as possible, but no later than 2015.25  The Cairo Conference recognized that reproductive rights include both “the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children, and to have the information and means to do so” and  Politics: Perspectives from the Women’s Movements, 61 N.Y.U.

L. 1137, 1158–60 (1997).  Reproductive rights encompass a wide range of activities.  These include surrogacy, other forms of assisted conception, female genital surgeries, and the health needs of women with HIV/AIDS.

See generally IVAR BLEIKLIE ET AL., COMPARATIVE BIOMEDICAL POLICY: GOVERNING ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES  (2004).  The focus of this Article, like that of CEDAW, is on core reproductive rights, including those set out in the African Protocol.

The committee ruled that Peru had ‘an obligation to take steps to ensure that similar violations do not occur in the future.’ MICHELLE GOLDBERG, THE MEANS OF REPRODUCTION 17 (2009).  30.

As Michelle Goldberg notes: [I]n many poor countries, including large parts of Africa and Latin America and parts of Asia and the Middle East, abortion is either banned entirely or allowed only to save a woman’s life.  Twenty-six percent of the world’s women and men live under such laws, which are largely the relics of colonial constitutions promulgated by European countries that have since abandoned such restrictions for themselves.  GOLDBERG, supra note 29, at 41. Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM  THE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER 267 restricts them; and to “fulfill” them, that is, to proactively assure their realization.33  Traditional human rights discourse, as set out in the International Bill of Rights,34 and even the provisions of the Women’s Convention which directly address reproductive rights,35 allow states to fall short.  Rather, it is CEDAW’s prohibition against the reproduction of gender which compels these rights, as explained below. B.  The Women’s Convention 1.  Beyond Non-Discrimination CEDAW explicitly guarantees women’s human rights, including their rights to participate in social, economic, cultural and political life on equal terms with men.  These rights include the civil and political rights familiar to Americans from our own Constitution, such as the right to vote36 and freedom of movement.37  These rights also include less familiar economic and social rights, such as the right to work38 and the right to health.39 Thus, CEDAW assures positive as well as negative rights, imposing obligations on the state.  Under CEDAW, moreover, rights are to be assured in fact as well as in law.  That is, CEDAW goes beyond formal equality (equality of opportunity) to require outcome equality.40  There is no required showing of discriminatory intent.  Under CEDAW, “discrimination” is genuinely robust: For the purposes of the present Convention, the term “discrimination against women” shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis   33. The Committee explains the requirements to “respect, protect and fulfil” rights in the context of reproductive rights specifically: 14. The obligation to respect rights requires States parties to refrain from obstructing action taken by women in pursuit of their health goals. . . . For example, States parties should not restrict women's access to health services or to the clinics that provide those services on the ground that women do not have the authorization of husbands, partners, parents or health authorities, because they are unmarried or because they are women. . . . 15.  The obligation to protect rights . . . requires States parties . . . to prevent and impose sanctions for violations of rights by private persons and organizations. . . . 17. The duty to fulfil rights places an obligation on States parties to take appropriate legislative, judicial, administrative, budgetary, economic and other measures to the maximum extent of their available resources to ensure that women realize their rights to health care. Studies such as those which emphasize the high maternal mortality and morbidity rates worldwide and the large numbers of couples who would like to limit their family size but lack access to or do not use any form of contraception provide an important indication for States parties of possible breaches of their duties to ensure women's access to health care.

As explained below, this is just the beginning. 2.  The Sexual Division of Labor As anthropologist Gayle Rubin notes, the sexual division of labor based on biological differences appears in “endless variety and monotonous similarity, cross-culturally and throughout history.”44  As Rubin explains: Although every society has some sort of division of tasks by sex, the assignment of any particular task to one sex or the other varies enormously . . . [the purpose] is to insure the union of men and women by making the smallest viable economic unit contain at least one man and one woman.  The division of labor by sex can therefore be seen as a ‘taboo’: a taboo against the sameness of men and women, a taboo dividing the sexes into two mutually exclusive categories, a taboo which exacerbates the biological differences between the sexes and thereby creates gender.45 The innumerable iterations of the sexual division of labor are often grounded in stereotypes of women as reproductive workers and men as productive workers.  This includes the ‘female-as-caregiver’ and ‘male-as-rightsholder’ stereotypes described by Aristotle.46  In his polis, men were citizens, and therefore rightsholders.  A woman’s role was to reproduce male citizens, by raising them as well as literally producing them.  For Aristotle, this was ‘natural.’  Rightsholders were male—never pregnant, never breastfeeding—and caregivers were female—always subject to the endless demands of caregiving, even if not actually pregnant or breastfeeding. CEDAW, in contrast, treats this bifurcation as socially constructed.  Under CEDAW, reproduction is both supported by the state and disaggregated from women’s traditional roles.  That is, even as CEDAW protects women’s reproductive rights, it situates reproduction in a social and cultural context.    41. BLANCHFIELD, supra note 7, at art. 1.  42. Id. at art. 2.  43.

Finally, Article 16 requires states to “take all appropriate measure to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations.”52 In addition to these specific guarantees, Article 5 more broadly demands recognition of maternity as a “social function.”53  It also requires states to educate men to share in reproductive work: States shall [T]ake all appropriate measures: (a) To modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women; (b) To ensure that family education includes a proper understanding of maternity as a social function and the recognition of the common responsibility of men and women in the upbringing and development of their children . . . .54   47.

Nigeria reported on six ambitions programs, undertaken to eliminate stereotypes pursuant to Article 5, including a new “National Policy on Education” which is “aimed at encouraging increased participation of the girl child in science and technology” and data indicating that women are “beginning to undertake those vocations which were previously considered masculine such as motor mechanic, welding, commercial drivers and motor-cyclists,” as well as efforts to publicize the Child’s Rights Act.

Rather, under CEDAW, women, like men, have rights, and men, like women, are expected to assume caregiving responsibilities. Because reproductive rights focus on experiences—conception, pregnancy, childbirth—that affect women more directly than they affect men, these experiences are not reflected in traditional rights discourse.62  CEDAW corrects this omission by recognizing women’s reproductive work and requiring the state—and men—to support it.

This does not mean, of course that women cannot nurse or that men cannot work as cashiers.  It means that the state has an obligation to identify and rectify gendered stereotypes: [W]hatever the motivation for different treatment, the result is to create a dual system of rights and responsibilities in which the rights of each group are governed by a different set of values. History and experience have taught us that in such a dual system one group is always dominant and the other subordinate.  As long as woman’s place is defined as separate, a male-dominated society will define her place as inferior. Barbara A.

International Equality Jurisprudence The argument that CEDAW requires the full assurance of women’s reproductive rights is further supported by two recent developments in international equality jurisprudence.  The first is grounded in rigorous studies documenting women’s economic subordination.  The second focuses on the burgeoning case law and commentary on same-sex relationships.  Both confirm that the sexual division of labor is socially, economically, and legally constructed, and that it can be deconstructed.  However entrenched, the sexual division of labor can—and should—be dismantled by law.65 1.

Even when women work outside the home, they continue to perform far more of this work than men.  In the United States, for example, Arlie Hochschild and Anne Machung described “the second shift” worked by employed women in the home amounting to an extra month’s work each year compared to their husbands.68  As sociologist Suzanne Bianchi and her colleagues have recently shown, the “second shift” persist twenty years later, albeit in more complicated forms: “Fathers’ increased childcare seems to have accelerated particularly in the 1990s . . . [but] [m]others still shoulder twice as much childcare and house work.”69 When women work outside of the home, moreover, most work in lower-paid ‘female’ occupations, replicating the sexual division of labor within the family.70  Because of the sexual division of labor, women remain relegated to a private sphere of home and family, poverty and powerlessness.71  They perform 66% of the world’s work,72  but they earn only 10% of the world’s income,73 and own merely 1% of the world’s property.74  The sexual division of labor is not the only cause of women’s poverty, but it is indisputably a major factor.75  Thus, the   66.

In addition, by impoverishing women, the sexual division of labor impoverishes the families and communities in which they live.  Women are less likely to spend money on alcohol or other forms of entertainment for themselves, and more likely to spend it in ways that benefit their children and families.76  As the World Bank observes, “a host of studies suggest that putting earnings in women’s hands is the intelligent thing to do to speed up development and the process of overcoming poverty.”77  Because women tend to reinvest more in their families and communities than men, the entire community benefits when women’s poverty is reduced. 2.  Same-Sex Relationships The second development in international equality jurisprudence which supports the argument against the sexual division of labor is its recent focus on same-sex couples.78  As Justice Albie Sachs explained in Fourie, extending the benefits of marriage to same-sex partners is fundamentally a matter of equality: [O]ur Constitution represents a radical rupture with a past based on intolerance and exclusion, and the movement forward to the acceptance of the need to develop a society based on equality and respect by all for all. A democratic, universalistic, caring and aspirationally egalitarian society embraces everyone and accepts people for who they are. The acknowledgement and acceptance of difference is particularly important in our country where for centuries group membership based on supposed biological characteristics such as skin colour has been the express basis of advantage and disadvantage . . . . [A]t issue is a need to affirm the very character of our society as one based on tolerance and mutual respect.79  some regions, education remains elusive” and that “poverty is a major barrier to education for girls”); Sidiya, supra note 59 (archaic laws and customs regarding employment); CYNTHIA GRANT BOWMAN & AKUA KUENYEHIA, WOMEN AND LAW IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 143-66 (2003) (describing the ways in which plural legal systems in Africa operate to deprive women of access to land); id. at 167-220 (explaining problems of female inheritance in Africa); Julie Mertus, State Discriminatory Family Law and Customary Abuses, in WOMEN'S RIGHTS, HUMAN RIGHTS 135, 137-39 (Julie Peters & Andrea Wolper eds., 1995) (describing ongoing child marriage, polygamy, dowry and bridewealth practices).

In validating same-sex marriage, courts and legislatures throughout the world have rejected the notion of a ‘natural’ sexual division of labor requiring marriage to be restricted to a union between a man and a woman.80  Rather, there is growing recognition that a state committed to democratic values, especially the equality of its citizens, can no longer endorse laws that discriminate against some of those citizens. The European Union, with its twenty-seven member states, has been a leader in recognizing the equal rights of same-sex couples.81  The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has interpreted the European Convention on Human Rights to require contracting nations to recognize family rights of same-sex couples.82  The Court relied on Article 14, which provides that the rights set forth in the Convention are to be secured “without discrimination on any ground” to allow the surviving member of a gay couple to remain in his flat.83  Under the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam, similarly, the European Council passed Council Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibits “any direct or indirect discrimination based on . . . sexual orientation.”84  In 2008, the European Court of Justice relied on this Directive to hold that the surviving partner of a German same-sex partner might be able to claim a pension.85  The Treaty of Lisbon,86 which entered into force on December 1, 2009, assures the right to marriage without any language limiting such right to “men and women” and expressly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.87  L.J. 781, 803 (2007).

Finding that Colombian law afforded prisoners a right to intimate visits, the Commission determined that the applicant had stated a colorable claim of arbitrary and abusive interference with her private life, in violation of Article 11(2) of the American Convention on Human Rights.89 On June 3, 2008, the Organization of American States (OAS) General Assembly, with the support of thirty-four countries, adopted a Resolution on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity.90  The resolution recognizes the significance of the adoption of the Yogyakarta Principles and stresses the core principles of universality and non-discrimination in international law.  In addition, states “agreed to hold a special meeting ‘to discuss the application of the principles and norms’ of the inter-American system to abuses based on sexual orientation and gender identity.”91 In North America, Canada passed the Civil Marriage Act in 2005 which recognizes same-sex marriage.92  The United States enacted the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996.93  DOMA defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, but it does not preclude states from recognizing same-sex marriage under their own laws.  Five states currently allow same-sex marriage.94  Forty-three states have laws explicitly prohibiting such marriages, including twenty-nine with constitutional amendments restricting marriage to one man and one woman.95  In Perry v. Schwarzenegger,96 Judge Vaughn Walker relied on the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down California’s Proposition 8, which   88. Giraldo v. Colombia, Case No. 11.656, Inter-Am. C.H.R., Rep.

In doing so, Judge Walker raised the question of same-sex marriage in the United States to the constitutional level for the first time.97 On the international level, too, the trend is clearly toward the recognition of rights for same-sex couples.  In Toonen v. Australia,98 for example, the Human Rights Committee determined that the provisions of the Tasmanian Criminal Code, which criminalized private same-gender sexual conduct between consenting adults, constituted an arbitrary interference with the author’s privacy, in violation of Article 17 of the ICCPR.99  The Committee also held, however, that the rights of same-sex couples to marry cannot be grounded in the Civil Covenant because of its specific language.100  In part because of such limitations in existing human rights law,101 in 2006 the International Commission of Jurists and the International Service for Human Rights, on behalf of a coalition of human rights organizations, convened a meeting in Indonesia to develop a set of international principles regarding sexual orientation and gender identity.  Twenty-nine distinguished experts in human rights law from twenty-five countries unanimously adopted the Yogyakarta Principles,102 which they agreed “reflect the existing state of international human rights law in relation to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity.”103  As set out in the Statute of the International Court of Justice   97.

The Yogyakarta Principles, rigorously supported by sixty-six pages of jurisprudential annotations,105 affirm a broad range of rights, including “the universal enjoyment of human rights, equality and non-discrimination . . . to which all human beings are entitled without distinction as to sexual orientation or gender identity.”106  The Principles also set out concrete measures states must take to assure these rights. On December 18, 2008, sixty-six nations at the UN General Assembly supported a groundbreaking Statement confirming that international human rights protections apply to sexual orientation and gender identity.  The Statement was read by Argentina and a Counterstatement, signed by fifty-nine states, was read by the Syrian Arab Republic.107  The states opposing human rights for same-sex couples do not seek to ground their arguments in international law.  Rather, they claim that the Statement endorsing these rights “lack[ed] . . . legal grounds [and] delves into matters which fall essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of States.”108  This is belied by the exhaustive research supporting the Yogyakarta Principles.109  While there is no state consensus on the issue, there is a clear trend toward recognizing the rights of same-sex couples.  Thus, although homosexuality remains a crime in seventy-six countries and is still punishable by death in five, a growing body of international equality jurisprudence increasingly supports these rights.110   104. I.C.J.

The Counterstatement, signed by 59 states, condemned the Statement, arguing further that: More important, it depends on the ominous usage of two notions.  The notion of orientation spans a wide range of personal choices that expand far beyond the individual sexual interest in a copulatory behavior between normal consenting adult human beings, thereby ushering in the social normalization and possibly the legitimization of many deplorable acts, including paedophilia.

HOW THE DENIAL OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS REPRODUCES GENDER This Part explains how the denial of reproductive rights reproduces gender.111  Reproductive rights may be usefully conceptualized along a continuum.  At one end, women have no choice as to when they will be impregnated or by whom.112  This reproduces gender because women may, at any time, be assigned reproductive work which only women can do.113  This work does not end with childbirth.  Rather, as the CEDAW Committee notes, “the responsibilities that women have to bear and raise children affect their right of access to education, employment and other activities related to their personal development.  They also impose inequitable burdens of work on women.”114  Women’s socially-constructed responsibilities for taking care of their children, as well as feeding, clothing, and nurturing the whole family, reproduce gender by perpetuating the stereotype of women as caregivers.115 Also at this end of the continuum are women involuntarily sterilized,116 forced to use contraceptives, or have abortions.117  First, these anti-natalist measures reproduce gender by denying women the choice to have children, perpetuating the stereotype of women as subordinates for whom such decisions can be made.118  Second, such measures reproduce gender by using women’s  same-sex relationships in Europe.

See generally FRANCES BARTKOWSKI, FEMINIST UTOPIAS (1989).  As MacKinnon muses, “Given the pervasiveness of inequality, imagination is the faculty required to think in sex equality terms.

This is explicitly recognized in the Statute of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Article 4(d), which defines “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group” as a form of genocide.120  Third, often overlapping but nevertheless distinct, anti-natalist measures may reproduce gender by using women’s reproductive capacity against the economic class of which they are a part.  This was a major concern during the Cold War.  As Goldberg explains, “fears of [a] swelling third world population” was the original impetus for U.S. family planning aid to poor  [B]ecause of the race- and class-based history of population control and sterilization abuse, women of color have a clearly ambivalent relation to the “abortion rights” platform.  For poor women of color, the notion of a “woman’s right to choose” to bear children has always been mediated by a coercive, racist state.

Goldberg provides a more graphic account: “Faced with fertility goals and targets set from above, family planning workers from India to Indonesia cajoled, bribed, and sometimes forced people into accepting birth control, and even sterilization.  All over the world birth control clinics were upgraded while other health facilities languished, dirty and run-down.”  GOLDBERG, supra note 29, at 67.  See generally LINDA GORDON, THE MORAL PROPERTY OF WOMEN: A HISTORY OF BIRTH CONTROL POLITICS IN AMERICA 334 (4th ed. 2007) (describing the infamous Dalkon Shield as “probably [responsible for] hundreds of thousands of severe infections and injuries, often leading to sterility and other permanent damage and long-lasting pain,” and noting that “as the awareness of dangers grew in the United States, [A. H. Robbins] dumped thirty-five thousand shields on the international market.  The company later refused to notify third-world users of the IUD’s dangers, agreeing only to alert foreign embassies.”).  In the United States, as Professor Roberts notes: Slave masters’ control of Black women’s reproduction illustrates better than any other example I know the importance of reproductive liberty to women’s equality.  Every indignity that comes from the denial of reproductive autonomy can be found in slave women’s lives – the harms of treating women’s wombs as procreative vessels, of policies that pit a mother’s welfare against that of her unborn child, and of government attempts to manipulate women’s childbearing decisions through threats and bribes. DOROTHY ROBERTS, KILLING THE BLACK BODY: RACE, REPRODUCTION AND THE MEANING OF LIBERTY 23 (1997).  This troubled history has been exploited by anti-abortion groups.  Anti-abortion groups have recently charged that, “Black children are an endangered species,” on 65 billboards in Georgia.  Shaila Dewan, Anti-Abortion Billboards on Race Split Atlanta, N.Y.

The claim about black children is dubious, however, since the fertility rate among black women remains higher than the national average.  See id.  119.

Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM  THE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER 281 countries.121  Reducing the number of poor people, in short was viewed as crucial to the fight against communism.  For some women, accordingly, the reproduction of gender has been exacerbated by the reproduction of race and class subordination. At the other end of the continuum are women who not only have the same legal rights as men, but rights assuring support for reproduction as well.  Just as the larger community benefits from reproduction, it shares in its costs.122  Under CEDAW, this is accomplished by assuring women’s right to health—and all other rights123—before, during, and after pregnancy.  In addition, as set out in Article 5, men as well as women are responsible for childcare,124 and gendered stereotypes are barred.125 The denial of reproductive rights reproduces gender because it takes control of their own reproductive capacity away from women, relegating them to a sexual division of labor based on biological differences.  It puts their bodies at the service of men or the state.  The denial of reproductive rights reproduces gender whether by a state or a non-state party, whether by explicit prohibitions126 or by the failure to provide necessary services, including childcare.   121. GOLDBERG, supra note 29, at 41.  122. This is what sex equality looks like in feminist utopias, where it is often accomplished by technology that takes over reproductive work.  See, e.g., CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN, HERLAND (1915) (women reproduce asexually).  MacKinnon describes it succinctly: If sex equality existed, there would be no more forced sex; safe effective contraception would be available and the psychological pressures surrounding its use would be gone; whatever womanhood meant, women would need neither men nor intercourse nor babies to prove it; abortions for sex-selection as now practiced would be unthinkable; the workplace would be organized with women as much in mind as men; the care of children would be a priority for adults without respect to gender; women would be able to support themselves and their families (in whatever form) in dignity through the work they do. MacKinnon, supra note 112, at 1326-27.  123.

Sometimes bans on abortion and contraception blatantly violate reproductive rights, like the ban in Romania under Nicolae Ceausescu.  According to one source, there were “over 10,000 deaths from illegally performed abortions and approximately 5.2 million cases of permanent sterility resulting from faulty . . . procedures.”  Abrams, supra note 15, at 897.

Denial by the State States have a legitimate interest in regulating reproduction to promote the health and general welfare of their citizens.127  Unlike most of the world, the United States does not have a natalist policy.128  83% of the global population lives in a state that has demographic goals that are supported by government policies in order to achieve them.129  Such policies may range from producing “soldiers for Islam,” as the Ayatollah exhorted Iranian women in the 1980s,130 or workers for the state, as East Germany urged women in the 1950s.131  The state objective may be illegal, like the genocidal rapes in the former Yugoslavia.132  Or the state policy may simply institutionalize customs that enable men to control women’s sexuality.133  Romanian women were likely to have five illegal abortions by the age of forty, resulting in an infertility rate of twenty percent.

As Susan Moller Okin  notes, this is not uncommon: Although the powerful drive to control women─and to blame and punish them for men’s difficulty in controlling their own sexual impulses─has been softened considerably in the more progressive reformed versions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, it remains strong in their more orthodox or fundamentalist versions.  Moreover, it is by no means confined to Western or monotheistic cultures.

Whatever the scarcity or emergency, the state cannot rectify it at the expense of the protected group.136 In addition to the violation of specific provisions, the state can deny reproductive rights by any acts or omissions that effectively restrict a woman’s choice.137  This includes the state’s failure to enable women to make decisions independently of their husbands, families, and communities.  It also includes the failure to provide affordable pre-natal and maternal healthcare and childcare.  As Professor Dorothy Roberts observes, this explains the often divergent concerns of American women: “The primary concern of white, middle-class women are laws that restrict choices otherwise available to them, such as statutes that make it more difficult to obtain an abortion.  The main concerns of poor women of color, however, are the material conditions of poverty and oppression that restrict their choices.”138  As Professor Roberts and others have shown, in the United States this has a long and ignominious history, beginning in slavery and continuing through the eugenics movement of the early twentieth  certainly encompasses most of the peoples of Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia─are quite distinctly patriarchal.

Implementation of the Women’s Convention, like that of all human rights treaties, may be constrained by a lack of resources.  But a lack of resources does not justify coerced abortion, sterilization, or childbirth.  A state might be unable to keep an infant with a severe infirmity alive, for example, but that would not justify forcing the mother to have an abortion.  Nor could a state refuse to allow abortions on the basis of cost, since a live birth ─and support of the resulting child─would cost even more.  See, e.g., ROBERTS, supra note 118, at 241 (noting that “[I]t is easier for an indigent woman to come up with the money for an abortion than for an indigent family to support a child for years.”).  137. See supra Part I.

Rather, the only alternative to poverty for women is to emulate men, becoming what Joan Williams describes as “ideal workers,” devoting themselves to their employers instead of their families.141 A state preference for birth, like that of the state in Maher,142 violates CEDAW because it does not allow women to choose abortion unless they can pay for it.  Denying abortions to such women reproduces gender by forcing women to become mothers,143 requiring them to perform nine months of reproductive work, suffer pain, and assume the risks of childbirth.144  As a practical matter, moreover, it may well relegate them to the private sphere of the home and the family for much longer.  In the United States, as Professor Siegel explains: Hypothetically, a woman compelled to bear a child she does not want could give it up for adoption, abandon it, or pay someone to care for the child until maturity.  In this society, however, . . . few women are able to abandon a child   139. See generally ROBERTS, supra note 118; LOMBARDO, supra note 129; JANET L. DOLGIN & LOIS L.

In Maher, the Supreme Court upheld a state law providing coverage for births, but not abortions.  Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 469, 474 (1977) (holding that neither state nor federal government must pay for an indigent woman’s abortion).  Presumably, it would also uphold a state law covering both.  143.

Gentler incentives, however, may be acceptable.  Many countries in Western Europe have policies intended to make procreation more appealing to women, by subsidizing their decision to have and raise a child.  A single mother in Denmark, for example, receives cash assistance, free kindergarten for her child, and subsidized housing.  See Katarina Tomasevski, Reproduction, Rights, and Reality: How Facts and Law Can Work for Women: European Approaches to Enhancing Reproductive Freedom, 44 AM. U. L. REV. 1037 (1995).

Once compelled to bear a child against their wishes, most women will feel obligated to raise it.145 Reproductive rights may also be denied by ostensibly neutral laws.  Professor Carol Sanger has shown, for example, how safe haven laws146 and informed consent laws147 are intended to deter abortion.  Such laws reproduce gender “[b]y connecting infant life to unborn life and infanticide to abortion,” and motherhood to pregnancy, evoking powerful stereotypes “to promote the political goal of the culture of life: the reversal of Roe v. Wade.”148  Reproductive rights may be denied by the failure to carefully think through the actual, variable conditions of reproductive work.  Professor Joanna Grossman has shown, for example, how even well-intentioned legislation like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act fails pregnant women by relying on a disability model.149  Reproductive rights may be denied by the failure to maintain an environment in which they can be safely and freely exercised, where, for example, men control sex.150 B.  Denial by Non-State Parties 1.  Cultural Traditions and Religious Beliefs As the CEDAW Committee has pointed out: In all nations, the most significant factors inhibiting women’s ability to participate in public life have been the cultural framework of values and religious beliefs, the lack of services and men’s failure to share the tasks associated with the organization of the household and with the care and raising of children.  In all nations, cultural traditions and religious beliefs have played a part in confining women to the private spheres of activity and excluding them from active participation in public life.151   145.

This is not an issue where there is no legal capacity.  In the case of child marriages, for example, there is no ability to opt out because a child lacks the capacity to consent.152  Nor, under CEDAW, do girls have the capacity to consent to female genital surgeries (FGS),153 a range of practices involving total or partial removal of the external female genitalia.154  Each year, an estimated two million girls undergo excision.155  As noted by the non-government organization (NGO) PLAN, FGS is a cultural, rather than a religious practice, most common in sub-Saharan and Northeastern Africa and where immigrants from these areas re-settle.  It is viewed as part of a woman’s rite of passage into adulthood, and considered a prerequisite to marriage.  The purpose of FGS is to reproduce gender in the starkest form.  As PLAN observes, “the pain endured is seen as part of the girl’s education.  It is believed to change her into a respectful, calm, and less demanding person who accepts her role as a servant to her husband.”156 The CEDAW Committee has carefully set out measures intended to eradicate the practice of FGS without triggering a backlash.157  In the Unites States, FGS on minors are illegal under federal law.158  While few condone the   152.

Where, for example, she faces serious physical sanctions ─ such as stoning─ from which the state either cannot or will not protect her, she has no real choice.  If the sanction is moral or social, on the other hand, the question is whether, as a practical matter, women can opt out.  As Dixon-Mueller puts it, “Religious values and social norms designed to limit the right to use any or all methods of fertility regulation such as artificial contraception or abortion may be freely accepted by individuals but cannot be imposed on those who choose not to accept such values and norms.” DIXON-MUELLER, supra note 28, at 14. Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM 288 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 18:261 2011 states, for example, allow religious laws, presumably including religious laws regarding reproduction, to govern marriage.164 The determination whether or not she has a real choice, however difficult, must be considered from the individual woman’s perspective.  For an outsider to conclude that she suffers from ‘false consciousness’165 assumes a superiority that itself reproduces gender.  As Professor Homi Bhabha explains: [The] norm of Western liberalism becomes at once the measure and mentor of minority cultures─Western liberalism, warts and all, as a salvage operation, if not salvation itself.  With a zealousness not unlike the colonial civilizing mission, the ‘liberal’ agenda is articulated without a shadow of self-doubt, except perhaps an acknowledgment of its contingent failings in the practice of everyday life.166 As Katha Politt observes, however: “In its demand for equality for women, feminism sets itself in opposition to virtually every culture on earth.  You could say that multiculturalism demands respect for all cultural traditions, while feminism interrogates and challenges all cultural  traditions.”167  Thus, the question of the individual woman’s own choice, from her perspective, must itself be unpacked.  Has she had access to education, including the ‘family education’ required under CEDAW,168 so that she is aware of the parameters of that choice?  The key to CEDAW’s approach to cultural and religious challenges is in Article 10, which requires states to assure women equal “access to studies . . .in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as urban areas” from pre-school through adulthood.169  This includes, it should be recalled, the recognition of the common responsibility of men and women in the upbringing and development of their children.170  Article 10 addresses the content of education, requiring the state to “eliminate any stereotyped concept of   164.

Whether─ ─and when a woman can opt out of such marriages poses complicated legal questions, which few women have the resources to resolve.  Some of the larger political cultures in which such religious laws are allowed are more supportive than others.  See, e.g., Siegel, The De Facto ERA, supra note 10, at 1330 (explaining how “constitutional culture channels social movement conflict”).  165. Cass Sunstein refers to: internalized norms of subordination.  The remedy of “exit”’─ the right of women to leave a religious order─is crucial, but it will not be sufficient when girls have been taught in such a way as to be unable to scrutinize the practices with which they have grown up.  People’s “preferences”─itself an ambiguous term─ need not be respected when they are adaptive to unjust background conditions; in such circumstances it is not even clear whether the relevant preferences are authentically “theirs.” Cass R.

The U.S. delegate, supported by the UNESCO observer, suggested that “stress be given to early or career education of children in order to eliminate sex-stereotyped roles and images.”172  Even if children attend religious schools, or are home-schooled,173 under CEDAW gender equality must be part of the curriculum. Equally important, a woman cannot freely exercise reproductive rights as a practical matter if she is economically or socially dependent on her cultural community, or if she would not have a place to live or work outside of it.  Thus, whether a woman truly enjoys reproductive rights cannot be ascertained without considering whether she can freely exercise other rights.  Just as other rights depend upon reproductive rights for their realization, reproductive rights depend upon them.174 2.  Husbands, Partners, and Parents As noted above,175 CEDAW breaks new ground in human rights law by explicitly assuring women’s rights in the private sphere of the family.  CEDAW recognizes that even where reproductive rights are legally assured by the state, as a practical matter they may be denied within the family.  A husband or partner can violate a woman’s reproductive rights, reproducing gender in the process, in any number of ways, from rape, to physically preventing her from using contraception,176 to forcing her to obtain an abortion by threatening her, to simply shirking childcare responsibilities.  A girl’s parents, similarly, may prevent her from obtaining family education and access to reproductive health care.177 The legal effect is the same as if the denial of rights were attributable to the state, and gender is reproduced in the same way.  American law addresses this   171. Id. at art. 10(c).  This includes “coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programmes and the adaptation of teaching methods.”  Id.  172.

III.  HOW THIS PLAYS OUT International law, for the most part, has been made by men, for men—historically, politically, structurally, and normatively.181  The idea that reproductive rights are women’s human rights is very recent.  The extent to which states have recognized these rights, albeit rhetorically, is remarkable.  That the resultant consensus is not on a par with freedom from torture is not.  Nor is the gap between the law as written and the law as applied. This does not mean, however, that the United States should join the list of hypocritical states that have ratified CEDAW with no intention of actually complying.  Again, I am not arguing here that the United States should ratify CEDAW; but if we do, we should do so in good faith.  The first section of this Part explains what CEDAW requires and why implementation remains problematic under international law.  The second section explains why the United States should ratify CEDAW as a congressional-executive agreement.  It concludes by describing how this would affect reproductive rights in the United States. A.  In International Law 1. What CEDAW Requires The actual “elimination of all forms of discrimination against women” remains a radical proposition, promising a world we can scarcely imagine.182  But that is precisely the proposition to which states have consented by ratifying CEDAW.  Since the denial of reproductive rights reproduces gender, by ratifying CEDAW states have agreed to assure reproductive rights, whether or   178. See, e.g., Ohio v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod.

Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM  THE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER 291 not that was their original intention.183  In fact, because the denial of these rights perpetuates the core stereotypes that CEDAW was drafted to eradicate, such denial is incompatible with CEDAW’s “object and purpose.”184 While a sovereign state cannot be bound without its consent, ratifying states consented to CEDAW and Articles 2, 5, and 16 are unambiguous.185  Just as the United States is liable under the Geneva Conventions186 and the Convention Against Torture187 (notwithstanding its subsequent insistence that water boarding was not in fact torture),188 once a state promises to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women it cannot later argue that this does not require the assurance of reproductive rights. Article 28.2 of CEDAW prohibits any “reservation incompatible with the object and purpose of the present Convention.”189  Reservations by states that effectively deny reproductive rights, accordingly, should not be allowed.190  In fact, under the reasoning of the ICJ in The Reservations to the Genocide Convention   183.

Even if there were any ambiguity, under Article 32 of the VCLT this would merely permit recourse to supplemental materials, such as the Travaux.  But there are no qualifications regarding reproductive rights in the Travaux.  On the contrary, the states (including the United States) seem to be vying with each other to strengthen the norm against discrimination.  See, e.g., REHOF, supra note 43, at 52-61.

Denial of reproductive rights violates both.194 As the Statement on Reservations further notes, the CEDAW Committee is “particularly concerned at the number and extent of reservations entered to those articles.”195  Several other state parties to the Convention have objected to these reservations on this ground.196  These states have not said that they do not consider the reserving party a party to the treaty, which a state may do when it views a reservation as incompatible.  Rather, they accept the reserving party as a party to the treaty, presumably for reasons similar to those articulated in the Genocide Case.  There, notwithstanding reservations to which some states objected, they recognized the “intention of the General Assembly and of the [adopting states] that as many states as possible should participate [given the Genocide Convention’s purely humanitarian and civilizing purpose.]”197  The CEDAW Committee takes a similar approach.198 2.

Some countries, such as the Netherlands, adopt international human rights treaties as domestic law upon ratification.  In these states, women would be able to bring suit in their own courts if they were denied their reproductive rights.199  In some of these states, reproductive rights are already assured under domestic law.  In others, however, those seeking to further these rights have successfully drawn on CEDAW.  For example, a May 2006 decision by the Constitutional Court of Colombia cited CEDAW when it determined that abortion should not be considered a crime in all circumstances (such as rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is in danger).200 Since there is no international Supreme Court to resolve conflicting opinions, the interpretations and remedies of the national domestic courts may vary considerably.  This ‘fragmentation’ of international law is a growing concern among international lawyers.  As set out in the Report of the International Law Commission on the Fragmentation of International Law (“ILC Report”), international law is losing coherence, certainty, and predictability because it lacks dependable mechanisms for reconciling inconsistencies.201 This fragmentation is exacerbated by the practice of some states, including the United States, which do not always automatically incorporate treaties.  Although such states may have ratified the Women’s Convention, accordingly, it is not enforceable as domestic law.  This means that women in these states cannot claim their rights under CEDAW in their national courts.202 Nor is there any international tribunal before which women may do so.  The ICJ only hears contentious cases between states.203  While the International Criminal Court (“ICC”) has jurisdiction over rape and coerced pregnancy committed “as part of a widespread or systematic attack,” this drastically limits   199. Where domestic courts do enforce CEDAW as part of domestic law, however, they should fully assure reproductive rights.  As MacKinnon explains, this necessarily include[s] the abortion right but [does] not center on it . . . . Women who are assaulted and miscarry, women who are forced to have abortions and women who are denied abortions, women who are sterilized, and women who are negligently attended at birth all suffer deprivation of reproductive control [as do women subject to] . . .  nonconsensual sterilization, forced obstetrical intervention, supervision of women’s activities during pregnancy under the criminal law, and denials of abortion through criminalization or lack of public funding where needed.

Its objective is to punish and deter crimes, not to further reproductive rights.  ‘Horizontal’ legal process is usually a factor in international compliance, but it is conspicuously absent in human rights.  That is, if a state fails to meet its obligations toward other states, those states typically refuse to meet their reciprocal obligations.  But states rarely pressure other states to treat their women fairly.205  People who live in glass houses do not throw stones. An Optional Protocol to the Women’s Convention enables individual women to file complaints before the CEDAW Committee.206  This is only an option for women whose states have ratified the Protocol.  Even in such cases, the Committee’s enforcement powers remain limited.  In sum, although states assume significant obligations under CEDAW, it costs them very little because of the absence of effective enforcement mechanisms. B.  In the United States If the United States ratifies CEDAW, it should do so in good faith, and commit to its unqualified implementation.  This may seem obvious to those unfamiliar with our long and shameful history of shirking international human rights obligations.  This section will first explain how the United States can ratify CEDAW while complying with international as well as domestic law.  It concludes by analyzing CEDAW’s impact on existing domestic law governing reproductive rights. 1.  Ratifying CEDAW as a Congressional-Executive Treaty Historically, ratification of international human rights treaties has been opposed by those who feared that the federal government would use international law to limit states’ rights.  The United States was eager to declare its support for international human rights after World War II, and recognized the need for other states to guarantee them.207  But the United States was less eager to invite scrutiny of its own practices, especially racial segregation in the American South.208   204.

Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM  THE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER 295 While the executive branch was concerned about the international reaction to domestic practices,209 the Senate was more concerned about the domestic reaction to international law-making, as revealed in the debate in the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Genocide Conventions: “If there is to be a succession of treaties from the United Nations dealing with domestic questions, are we ready to surrender the power of the States over such matters to the Federal Government?”210  Many in Congress were emphatically not “ready to surrender the power of the states over . . . to the federal government”—and certainly not to the U.N. Senator Bricker of Ohio proposed an amendment to the United States Constitution which would require an Act of Congress before any human rights treaty could become law in the United States.211  The Eisenhower administration was able to defeat the Bricker Amendment, but only by promising not to ratify any human rights treaties.212  It was not until 1992, after the end of the Cold War, and any possible claim that ratification might give the Soviets an advantage, that the United States finally ratified the Civil Covenant.213  Even then, it did so with reservations, understandings and declarations (“RUDs”) that ensure that the Civil Covenant cannot be relied on in U.S. courts,214 and that it adds nothing to rights already assured under existing domestic law.215  As Harold Koh has observed, we remain wary: “In the cathedral of human rights, the United States is more like a flying buttress than a pillar—choosing to stand outside the international structure supporting the international human rights system, but   209.

Ratification of the Women’s Covenant as a congressional-executive treaty would be a good start.  Congressional-executive treaties, which must be approved by a simple majority of the Senate and the House, have long served as a practical alternative to Article II treaties, requiring the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.  As Professor Oona Hathaway points out, congressional-executive treaties are generally recognized as interchangeable with Article II treaties218 among scholars219 as well as lawmakers.220  Congressional-executive agreements avoid the political impasse often triggered by Article II’s supermajority requirement.  They also have the advantage of what Professor Hathaway calls “one-stop shopping;”221 that is, they are presumed to be self-executing under the Supremacy Clause.222  Thus, they enable the United States to avoid debacles like the decision in Medallin v. Texas,223 in which the Supreme Court held that Texas law trumped U.S. international obligations because the treaties on which those obligations were based were non-self-executing.224   216.

It is, as a mechanical matter, breathtakingly simple. . . . All that is necessary to end the use of the Article III process is for the President to cease proposing agreements as Article II treaties and instead to propose them as congressional-executive agreements.”228   Assuming that the United States ratifies the Women’s Convention, as set out above, the analysis set out in III.A. In International Law,229 would apply to the United States as well as to any other state party.230  In the alternative, domestic legislation would be necessary if the United States were to meet its international obligations because the Women’s Convention would not create a private right of action in the U.S. courts.231   In either case, CEDAW would effectively be incorporated in U.S. law.232  The result, for present purposes, would be national law, binding on the states under the Supremacy Clause,233 barring the reproduction of gender in connection with reproductive rights. 2.

This assumes, perhaps too optimistically, that the United States would comply with international law.  In fact, the reservations, understandings, and declarations (“RUDs”) already drafted in connection with U.S. ratification of CEDAW suggest otherwise.

It would, however, provide a further basis for reproductive rights. CEDAW would establish a comprehensive federal floor for the national assurance of reproductive rights, including education, access to contraception and medical care, and the full panoply of rights set out above.237  We currently have no national floor because the United States does not recognize affirmative reproductive rights.  As noted above, the United States does not even recognize the human right to health.238  Instead, American women enjoy only the reproductive rights they can afford.  As Professor Law points out: More U.S. women confront unintended pregnancy than women in nearly every other developed country. One reason is that most employment-based health insurance programs in the United States exclude payment for contraceptives from otherwise comprehensive coverage for prescription drugs and medical services.239 Under CEDAW, all American women would have access to contraception, which would probably limit the need for abortion.  Although data indicate that the majority of American women who have had abortions said that they were using contraceptives when they became pregnant,240 the recent developments of an after-sex pill that can prevent pregnancy if taken within five days of intercourse241 may further reduce the number of abortions sought.242  The use of   235.

Rather, these rights would also be protected by CEDAW’s broad and powerful bar on the reproduction of gender.251 The privacy rationale for reproductive rights has been criticized since it was articulated.  As Professor Linda McClain observes: “[P]rivacy connotes female seclusion and subordination, leading to women’s under-participation in society and vulnerability to violence in the home.”252  These concerns are particularly pertinent in the context of reproductive rights.  As Justice O’Connor noted in striking Pennsylvania’s spousal notification law in Casey: [T]here are millions of women in this country who are the victims of regular physical and psychological abuse at the hands of their husbands.  Should these women become pregnant, they may have very good reasons for not wishing to inform their husbands of their decision to obtain an abortion.

As noted above, this goes beyond non-discrimination to address the sexual division of labor itself.

As Professor Frances Olsen and others note, grounding reproductive rights in privacy, accordingly, undercuts claims for public funding.254  Rather, American proponents have long argued that these rights should be grounded in “equality.”255  As Professors Neil Siegel and Reva Siegel recently discovered, Justice Ginsburg relied on equality while representing a pregnant service woman in 1972.256  As Professor Anita Allen explains, the equality argument includes two propositions.  First, “prohibiting abortion is a form of prima facie or de jure sex discrimination,” and, second, it “results from constitutionally unacceptable stereotypes.”257  Both propositions, as explained above, are encompassed by CEDAW. But there are problems with equality under Constitutional doctrine.  As Professor Law notes: “[T]he development of modern constitutional sex equality doctrine has suffered from a lack of focus on biological reproductive differences between men and women.”258  In addition, sex-based classifications are only viewed as ‘quasi-suspect’ by the Supreme Court.259  Unlike race, they do not trigger strict scrutiny.  As Professor Suzanne Goldberg has shown, this has produced a hopelessly convoluted jurisprudence.260  Like privacy doctrine, moreover, equal protection imposes no affirmative obligations on the state.   254.

As Professor Fineman explains, “[A]n impoverished sense of equality is embedded in our current legal doctrine.  We understand equality in terms that are formal, focused on discrimination, and inattentive to underlying societal inequities.”261  Instead, she argues for a “richer and more robust guarantee of equality,”262 grounded in “the term ‘vulnerable’ for its potential in describing a universal, inevitable, enduring aspect of the human condition that must be at the heart of our concept of social and state responsibility.”263  Professor West, similarly, faults the legalistic safeguards of Roe and Casey for neglecting the social and economic circumstances in which reproductive choices are made.264  As Professor Colker concludes, “A woman in my view has the right to seek an abortion to protect the value of her life in a society that disproportionately imposes the burdens of pregnancy and child care on women and does not sufficiently sponsor the development and use of safe, effective contraceptives.”265 CEDAW addresses all of these issues.  Equality under CEDAW is more muscular than equality under American equal protection doctrine.  First, it is broader in scope.  It bars all forms of discrimination; there is no requirement of intent, state action, or disparate impact.266  Second, it requires states to focus on the “underlying societal inequities” that concern Professor Fineman and to proactively address the social and economic circumstances in which reproductive choices are made, as Professor West urges.  Thus, the refusal to pay for poor women’s abortions, which the Supreme Court upheld in Maher v. Roe267 and Harris v. McRae268 would be barred under CEDAW.  Third, CEDAW  presumption of constitutionality is inappropriate and the state should bear the burden of justifying its rule . . . .“  Law, supra note 258, at 1009.      Ratification of CEDAW would not necessarily subject gender-based regulations to the same standard as race-based regulations.  As Professors Chinkin and Charlesworth have pointed out, for example, the obligations imposed on state parties under the Women’s Convention require them to take “all appropriate measures without delay” in contrast to the “immediately binding” obligations imposed under the Race Convention.

Thus, under CEDAW, those claiming reproductive rights are not “left alone” in the private sphere,269 but welcomed into the public sphere with appropriate accommodations for workers, including pregnant or nursing workers, and their children.  CEDAW further recognizes the obligation of the larger community to provide actual material support before, during, and after birth.  As Professor Law explains, this is crucial to women’s equality.  She understands, as did the CEDAW framers, that gender equality requires “transformation of the family, child-bearing arrangements, the economy, the wage/labor market, and human consciousness.”270 There is an additional issue.  The abortion cases also recognize the “State’s interest in potential life.”271  Ninth Amendment privacy does not outweigh this interest as long as the state statute or regulation does not place “a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.”272  Under international human rights law, the state interest in “potential life” would probably not outweigh CEDAW-strength equality.  As Professor Philip Alston has explained, a fetus is not considered a “person” under international law.273  As Professor Balkin notes, many American jurists have reached a similar conclusion.274   product not of governmental restrictions on access to abortions, but rather of her indigency.”).

As Balkin and others have pointed out, if a fetus is a person from the moment of conception, allowing abortion in the case of incest or rape makes no more sense than excusing murder because the victim was produced from a coerced or incestuous union.

WADE SHOULD HAVE SAID, supra note 10, at 86, 89 (citing Justice Clark:“[n]o prosecutor has ever returned a murder indictment charging the taking of the life of a fetus.  This would not be the case if the fetus constituted human life.”). Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM  THE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER 303 Professor Siegel suggests that statutes permitting abortion in cases of rape or incest implicitly concede the point.275 Where, like here, international law provides greater protection than that afforded by domestic law, the state should not prevail.  As Professor Lori Damrosch explained with respect to the Torture Convention: If the Administration is correct about the substantial conformity of U.S. law to the Convention’s requirements, then there is no reason to erect an artificial barrier to the application of the Convention as a complementary but fully compatible source of law.  On the other hand, to the extent that the Convention may provide greater protection than Constitution or statutory law . . . it is all the more important to allow the Convention to operate of its own force.276 Whether CEDAW’s more muscular equality would lead to a different standard would be an open question to be decided by the Roberts Court.  As journalist Adam Liptak recently observed, the Roberts Court is the “most conservative Court in decades,”277 and it seems willing to leave reproductive rights to the states.278  As Dawn Johnsen notes, “Since Casey, states have adopted literally hundreds of abortion restrictions, reflecting an incremental, multitiered strategy to create ‘abortion-free’ states and to deter women from having abortions, often through deception.”279  The Supreme Court has also expressed doubts about drawing on international law although, as Professor Martha Davis and Bethany Withers point out, “Justice Scalia cited transnational law on abortion rights in his dissent in Atkins v. Virginia, using it to argue that the U.S. law on the subject was relatively liberal.” 280   275. “The statutory exception allowing women to have abortions if they conceive by rape indicates that the state’s decision to prohibit abortion rests on unarticulated assumptions about how women are to comport themselves sexually─a code the state enforces by selectively allowing women access to abortion.”  Siegel, supra note 65, at 77.  276.

Stark_paginated 9/7/2011  5:57:33 PM 304 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 18:261 2011 CONCLUSION This Article has explained how CEDAW bars the reproduction of gender, and why that requires nothing less than the full assurance of women’s reproductive rights.  It has explained how earlier human rights law recognized women’s reproductive rights, and how that law fell short.  CEDAW goes beyond mere non-discrimination to assure equality on steroids; it situates reproductive rights in the public sphere, and requires states—as well as non-state actors—to respect, protect, and fulfill them.  CEDAW challenges, and firmly rejects, the sexual division of labor in its endless cultural variations. Part I drew on decades of rigorous empirical work to show the depths of women’s poverty and how, exactly, that poverty is grounded in the sexual division of labor.  This Part concluded by describing the trend in international equality jurisprudence toward recognition of same-sex relationships.  Like CEDAW’s bar on the reproduction of gender, this jurisprudence exposes the sexual division of labor as a human construct, which can and should be repudiated. Part II showed how the denial of women’s reproductive rights specifically reproduces gender.  It takes control of their own reproductive capacity away from women, relegating them to a sexual division of labor based on biological differences.  It puts their bodies at the service of men or the state.  The denial of reproductive rights reproduces gender whether by a state or a non-state party, whether by explicit prohibitions or by the failure to provide necessary services, including childcare.  Part III explained how this plays out, internationally and in the United States.  Part III first drew on recent work on the fragmentation of international law to describe the proliferation of national applications.  It concluded by situating this law in U.S. constitutional jurisprudence, showing how the arguments set out in this Article resonate with the arguments of Justice Ginsburg, and Professors Law, Siegel and others, to ground reproductive rights in equality, rather than privacy.  Efforts to do so under the U.S. Constitution have failed.  As this Article demonstrates, CEDAW’s broad and powerful bar on the reproduction of gender is stronger than equal protection.  It can do the work necessary to assure reproductive rights, the bedrock of women’s equality.  ",
