This article presents analysis of online debate on the BBC news website inNovember 2013, comprising 864 readers’ responses to an article entitled ‘Germanyallows ‘indeterminate’ gender at birth’. It explores how discourse reﬂectingWestern essentialist beliefs about people having one sex or ‘the other’ ismaintained in debates conducted in this online public space. Comments werecoded thematically and are presented under ﬁve sub-headings: overall evaluationof the German law; discussing and disputing statistics and ‘facts’; binarycategorisations; religion and politics; and ‘conversations’ and threads. Although formany the mapping of binary sex onto gender was unquestionable, this view wasstrongly disputed by commentators who questioned the meanings of ‘natural’ and‘normal’, raised the possibility of removing societal binary male-femaledistinctions or saw maleness–femaleness as a continuum. While recognising thatonline commentators are anonymous and can control their self-presentation, thisanimated discussion suggests that social classiﬁcations as male or female, even ifquestioned, remain fundamental in public debate in the early 21st century.Keywords: sex, gender, lay concepts, Internet and research, content analysisIntroductionIn November 2013 the BBC news website reported the passage of a new law in Germany thatovertly challenged the dichotomous classiﬁcation of newborns as either ‘male’ or ‘female’.The news article, (BBC News, 2013), described Germany as ‘Europe’s ﬁrst country to allowbabies with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as neither male nor female’, so creat-ing ‘a new category of “indeterminate sex”’. The article precipitated 864 reader commentsposted on the website. We argue that these provide a rare chance to examine public under-standings and views of ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ and the extent to which they reﬂect longstandingacademic debates about these phenomena as unambiguously dichotomous (or not), as overlap-ping or distinct, and as ﬂuid or ﬁxed. The comments include the perspectives of people withrelevant life experiences or self-proclaimed vested interests and others who may have no© 2016 The Authors.

To contextualise this analysis, we ﬁrst brieﬂyrehearse relevant and well-recognised problems with the terms ‘sex’ and ‘gender’ and provideperhaps less familiar background on how the naming of what the BBC referred to as ‘indeter-minate sex’ is also ‘politicized and controversial’ (Davis 2015: 89) and historically bounded.Sex and gender: distinguishable and distinct?Since the 1970s, following Oakley’s popularisation of a distinction between sex (‘the biologi-cal differences between male and female: the visible difference in genitalia’) and gender (ascultural, ‘the social classiﬁcation into ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’) (Oakley 1985:16), the extentto which these can be distinguished conceptually and empirically and the pervasiveness of bin-ary thinking about both sex and gender have been challenged by many authors, including Oak-ley herself (1985). In this long, contested, academic debate (for example, Butler 1990, Fausto-Sterling 1993), contrasts have been made between ‘having’ a sex and ‘being’ a gender (Hester2004b, Paechter 2003), between sex as biology and gender as social or socially constructed(Rubin 2012). Lorber and Farrell highlight societal investment in gender categorisation, notinghow gender ‘is built into the social order . . . The major social institutions of control – law,medicine, religion, politics – treat men and women differently’ (1991: 1–2). Their descriptionof gender as ‘a major social status (if not the major social status)’ (p. 2) echoes Goffman(1977: 302), who asserted that ‘In all societies, all infants at birth are placed in one or in theother of two sex classes, . . . accomplished by inspection of the infant’s naked person, speciﬁ-cally its genitalia, these being visibly dimorphic’ (emphasis in original), arguing that what hetermed ‘sex-class placement’ is ‘almost without exception exhaustive of the population andlife-long, providing an exemplary instance, if not a prototype, of social classiﬁcation’ (empha-sis added, p. 302).Goffman’s description of the ubiquity of ‘sex-class placement’ at birth provides an obviouscontext for the online discussion provoked by the new German law. However, not only hasthe uncritical (or interchangeable) use of terms in academic publications and analyses blurredthe distinction between sex and gender (Emslie et al. 1999) but it is increasingly recognisedthat they do not map neatly onto each other (Krieger 2003) and that, despite assertions that ‘Itis very easy to classify people according to their [biological] sex’ (Alvesson and Due Billing1997: 26) this is by no means universally true.1The changed and changing language and categorisation of ‘intersex’/DSDThe BBC article uses the term ‘intersex’ to refer to babies born with what is currently, in med-ical contexts at least, termed ‘disorders of sexual development’ (DSD), following a consensusconference held in Chicago in 2005 that deﬁned DSD as ‘congenital conditions in whichdevelopment of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex is atypical’ (Lee et al. 2006: e488). Itis often described as an umbrella term, covering a wide range of conditions deﬁned by thesocial meaning attached to atypical sex anatomy rather than common causes or clinical fea-tures (Karkazis and Feder 2008).The language used to describe those with such conditions has been contested over manydecades (Davis 2015). The term intersex was introduced in the early 20th century to refer to‘biological sex types that fell between male and female’ (Dreger and Herndon 2009: 208) andto ‘describe the state of being born with a combination of characteristics (for example, genital,gonadal, and/or chromosomal that are typically presumed to be exclusively male or female’(Davis 2015: 2). The term became associated with an all-encompassing identity (as neither orboth male and/or female) and with political activism, and some argued that it was disliked bymany of those personally affected (Dreger and Herndon 2009, Feder and Karkazis 2008).Those who support the use of the term DSD believe it emphasises the biological factors© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHIL2 Helen Sweeting et al.impacting on sex development, rather than identity, and so may be more manageable and lessstigmatising than alternatives (Karkazis and Feder 2008); indeed, it has been suggested thatmost parents (95%) and healthcare professionals (80%) prefer the term (Davies et al. 2011).However, others see DSD (particularly ‘disorder’) as medicalising or pathologising (Davieset al. 2011, Reis 2007).While DSD is currently used in much of the medical literature to which we refer, we recog-nise arguments by Davis (2015) that its use has caused tension in the intersex community, andthose rejecting ‘DSD language tend to reject the idea that sex, gender and sexuality are biolog-ically prescribed bodily phenomena’ (p. 146). We have tried to respect views that ‘peopleshould be able to choose whatever term – or terms they ﬁnd suitable’ (Davis 2015: 146) byusing ‘intersex/DSD’ in what follows (except in direct quotes from articles or online com-ments). In doing this we seek to signal our recognition that the ways such terms are (re)appro-priated by different protagonists are very speciﬁcally socially and historically located.2 Wealso note that some who reject the pathologisation of people labelled as intersex/DSD may pre-fer to read DSD as ‘divergences’ of, rather than ‘disorders’ of sex development (Feder andKarkazis 2008, Reis 2007).Rates and medical management of intersex/DSDEstimates of intersex/DSD rates differ widely, due to both the secrecy or stigma that are oftenassociated with any uncertainty about ‘sex-placement’, and the between-population variationsin the rates of some intersex/DSD conditions (Ahmed et al. 2004, Blackless et al. 2000, Chauand Herring 2002, Dreger and Herndon 2009). However, the main reason for differing esti-mates is variation in what ‘counts’ as intersex/DSD. In 1993, Fausto-Sterling (1993) reportedthat the psychologist Money, who specialised in the study of those born with sexual-organ ‘de-fects’, had suggested that ‘intersexuals’ may constitute up to 4% of births. The immediate refu-tation and description of the statement as ‘epidemiologically reckless’ by Money himself(Money 1993) appears to have been overlooked, and the 4% ﬁgure has been repeated in theliterature (Chau and Herring 2002, Gough et al. 2008, Zeiler and Wickstrom 2009). A reviewof over 40 years’ medical literature, conducted in 2000, concluded that 1.7% of all live birthsdid not conform to absolute sex chromosome, gonadal, genital and hormonal dimorphism(Blackless et al. 2000). However, this very broad deﬁnition includes individuals whose geni-talia appear ‘normal’ at birth, and a subsequent article suggested that restricting it to thosewho would be recognised by clinicians as having intersex/DSD at birth, reduces the prevalenceto around 0.018% (Sax 2002). Applying these ﬁgures to the UK’s 777,400 births in 2014(Ofﬁce for National Statistics 2015) would result in estimated numbers of babies born withintersex/DSD that year of 31,100 (4% births), 13,200 (1.7%) or 140 (0.018%).Before the 20th century there was no medical management of intersex/DSD (Preves 2002).In 1955, Money and colleagues proposed guidelines that for the next 40–50 years dominatedthe medical approach to children born with what has often been described by both cliniciansand activists (for example, Blizzard 2002, Dreger and Herndon 2009, Hughes 2008) as ‘am-biguous genitalia’ (Chau and Herring 2002, Hester 2004a). These guidelines were premised onthe belief that we are born ‘psychosexually neutral’ and that ‘children could be steered oneway or the other so long as the steering began before the age of two, give or take a fewmonths’ (Dreger and Herndon 2009: 202). Over this period a newborn with ‘ambiguous geni-talia’ was typically treated as a medical ‘emergency’, to be considered by a clinical team(physician, endocrinologist, urologist and possibly also psychologist/psychiatrist) who tried todetermine the child’s ‘true sex’ based on examinations and tests to determine presumed futurefertility, endocrine function and pubertal development (Hester 2004b, Kuhnle and Krahl 2002).Surgical intervention, usually directed to constructing genitalia as female (Barbaro et al. 2011,© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHILSex category ambiguity in online debate 3Kessler 1990), was recommended as soon as possible, to create genitalia compatible with the‘sex of rearing’ (Ahmed et al. 2004, Barthold 2011, Blizzard 2002). Before deciding whetherto consent to such surgery on behalf of their child, parents were generally advised not to usegender pronouns when referring to them. After deciding, typically the child was given a gen-dered name, received surgery, and parents were asked to consistently socialise them in linewith their surgically modiﬁed anatomy (Hester 2004a).By the 1990s Money’s hypothesis and the resulting paternalistic medical approach, particu-larly early surgery, was increasingly challenged (Chau and Herring, 2002). Methodologicallimitations meant the evidence justifying its continuation was weak (Barthold 2011) and onekey piece of evidence, the so-called ‘John/Joan’ case, was shown to be ﬂawed. In this infa-mous case, one of a set of twin boys suffered severe burning to his penis during surgical treat-ment. His parents sought Money’s advice, who recommended the child should have theremainder of his penis removed, this operation being carried out at around the age of 20months (Money and Ehrhardt 1972). Following his reassignment as a girl, Money instructedthe family to name, and treat, him as female. Although this ‘experiment’ was initially pre-sented as successful and evidence of Money’s theory (Chau and Herring 2002, Dreger andHerndon 2009, Preves 2002), ‘Joan’ subsequently reported the immense difﬁculties he experi-enced until he eventually rejected his assigned female name (to become David Reimer) andbody (receiving surgery to reconstruct a penis) (Colapinto 2000). Around the same time therewas growing activism of adults who had received surgical treatment as infants, raising doubtsabout the consequences of unnecessary (or unnecessarily early) interventions performed with-out the patient’s informed consent (Hegarty and Chase 2000). Partly in response to this,healthcare professionals also began questioning the need for early surgery and focused increas-ingly on patient-centred care (Barthold 2011, Reis 2007); and a ‘physician-patient covenant’(Rivkees 2006: 1287). The 2005 Chicago Consensus statement therefore noted that appear-ance-altering surgery was not urgent while also recommending rapid gender assignment basedon open communication between a multidisciplinary team and the baby’s family (Houk et al.2006). A 2016 update on the diagnosis and care of individuals with intersex/DSD notes thecontinued controversy around medical management and ‘intense scrutiny’ of surgical interven-tion (Lee et al. 2016), with some studies suggesting there was only very slight evidence forpractice changes in childhood surgery for ambiguous genitalia since the publication of the con-sensus (Michala et al. 2014).Problematising binary sex/gender categorisationsHowever, more fundamental doubts of some scholars over the medical management and ‘nor-malisation’ of those born with ‘ambiguous genitalia’ were not addressed by the Chicago Con-sensus statement. These can be summarised as the perpetuation by the medical community of‘the belief that gender consists of two exclusive types. . . in the face of incontrovertible physi-cal evidence that this is not mandated by biology’ (Kessler 1990: 25). Paralleling the moregeneral medicalisation literature that highlights how healthcare systems reﬂect societal valuesin their categorisation and correction of ‘abnormal’ bodies (Brown 1995), these authors pointout that binary gender norms are so universal in Western cultures that they are internalised as‘natural’, with the resulting pathologisation of bodies deviating from the norm (Bishop 2007,Dreger and Herndon 2009, Fausto-Sterling 2000, Feder and Karkazis 2008, Hester 2004a).Those critical of past medical management strategies suggest they focused on ﬁxing intersex/DSD, when it is the social system which is reductive and pathological (Preves 2002).Just as deﬁning children as abnormal in relation to height and weight growth charts hasbeen problematised (Armstrong 1995), so authors questioning binary gender norms have sug-gested that babies born with intersex/DSD demonstrate that the area between complete© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHIL4 Helen Sweeting et al.‘maleness’ and complete ‘femaleness’ is natural (Chau and Herring 2002, Fausto-Sterling2000). As discussed above, sex-class placement and its presumed overlap with gender (andoften also sexuality [Davis 2015]) is the foundation of Western social structures, a basis ofself-identiﬁcation and societal organisation (Goffman 1977, West and Zimmerman 1987).However, this need not be the case; there are few situations where the law needs to distinguishmale from female (Chau and Herring 2002), and in different historical periods and culturesmore than two sex categories have been recognised (Lang and Kuhnle 2008, Monro 2007).Some suggest an alternative might be to dissolve the distinction between male and female(Fausto-Sterling 2000), conceptualising sex as a continuum (Monro 2007).However, despite a socio-political context that is much more open to a range of sexual iden-tities than previously (Roen 2004), even those considering a future without distinction on thegrounds of sex ﬁnd it difﬁcult to imagine in current circumstances (Warnke 2001). In cultureswhere more than two sex categories are recognised, the status of the minority categories tendsto be low (Ahmed et al. 2004). Crucially, some individuals affected by intersex/DSD do notbelieve that shame or stigma will necessarily be reduced by raising children as a third or nogender (Dreger and Herndon 2009) and the few studies of parents of babies born with ‘am-biguous genitalia’ highlight their bewilderment and disorientation, which is relieved only whentheir baby is assigned a sex (Gough et al. 2008, Zeiler and Wickstrom 2009).This studyIt is against this contested debate both about sex/gender and the diagnosis, naming (Davis2015) and societal ‘conspiracy of silence’ (Kerry 2011) about intersex/DSD that we set ouranalysis of readers’ comments responding to the BBC’s story about the introduction in Ger-many of a category for ‘indeterminate sex’ at birth. It has been suggested that while the mediacan provide information and shape responses to issues (Kitzinger 2000, Seale 2002), ‘the termintersex fails to make its mark in the media’ (Kerry 2011: 263). Two exceptions to this generalrule prior to the BBC piece followed revelations of David Reimer’s rejection of his imposedfemale gender (Colapinto 2000) and the reporting in 2004 of his suicide.3 Another crucialaspect of context is the growth of the Internet since the mid-1990s, enabling (private) onlineinformation searches (Dutton et al. 2013) and user-generated content, including blogs andcommentaries (Hookway 2008, J€onsson and €Ornebring 2011). It has been suggested this hasbeen the key to the emergence of the intersex movement (Kerry 2011) and to diminishing thesocial isolation of intersex/DSD people and their parents (Davis 2015). Our analysis allows usto explore how discourse reﬂecting essentialist beliefs about people having one sex or ‘theother’ is maintained in debates in this online public space (Bou-Franch 2013).MethodsThe BBC article noted that parents of babies born in Germany were to be allowed to leavegender blank on birth certiﬁcates, ‘in effect creating a new category of “indeterminate sex”’. Itsuggested that as ‘many as one in 2,000 people have characteristics of both sexes’ (implying a0.05% prevalence rate) and described ‘intersex’ people as having a mix of male and femalechromosomes or genitalia characteristic of both sexes. The article highlighted parental difﬁcul-ties in having to quickly choose which sex to register their baby,4 described the harmful long-term effects of surgery performed on babies and quoted an ‘intersex’ woman and counsellor assaying ‘This pink and blue thing is a nonsense’. It also noted that several countries had takensimilar steps, beginning with Nepal, which recognised a third gender on census forms in 2007© 2016 The Authors.

Of these, 36 wereremoved by the website moderator for contravening house rules.5 The remaining 828 com-ments were coded thematically, based on their interpreted meanings (rather than the use ofexplicit words or concepts), using NVivo 9. Following discussions among all authors of theinitial themes, three (LW, MM, HS) independently coded the ﬁrst 100 comments and agreedon the following: speciﬁc praise/criticism of legislation; prevalence of intersex/DSD; gender,sex and society (including ‘facts’/understandings and opinions/debate); practical implications;treatment, surgery and medicalisation; religion; Germany and politics. Some comments werecoded to several themes; comments responding to other commentators were also identiﬁed. Afurther 100 comments were independently coded by two researchers (LW, MM), as an iterativeprocess until complete agreement was reached; LW then coded the remainder. The relativelysmall amount of textual material (around 40,000 words) meant all coding could also be veri-ﬁed by HS during analysis and writing up the results. Figure 1 shows the number of com-ments coded to each theme.The default format for BBC comments is the comment number, commentator name andtheir comment. Responses to speciﬁc comments are prefaced by the commentator number andname to whom they are being addressed. This means conversational threads are identiﬁable,even when separated by unrelated comments, unless an individual chooses to remove the nameof the commentator to whom they are replying. The most proliﬁc commentators and their‘conversations’ were identiﬁed by searching for their names as a commentator or withinothers’ replies.050100150200250300Figure 1 Number of comments coded to each theme© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHIL6 Helen Sweeting et al.Following a brief descriptive introduction, we present our analysis under ﬁve sub-headings:overall evaluation of the German law; discussing and disputing statistics and ‘facts’; binarycategorisations; religion and politics; and ‘conversations’ and threads. Examples of commentsare presented as originally posted, including any grammatical or spelling errors, and are unat-tributed.ResultsThe 864 comments were uploaded by 493 individual commentators, with 366 making onlyone comment. The 10 most proliﬁc together contributed 151 comments. Although the potentialfor anonymity and control over self-presentation means we cannot know anything for certainabout those posting (including their gender), some comments were very personal:I’m a man, married with kids (donor) and (drum roll) intersex. . . I have an extra X chromo-some. The biggest barrier faced by intersex men, women and children are some of the viewsbelow [referring to comments already posted]; it was not until I accepted that I am mixedgender that I actually found happiness.Other commentators referred to the experiences of people they knew, including a child, sibling(‘My brother was born in the early 60s of indeterminate sex and Drs chose that he would bemale less than 2 hours later after a ‘“thorough look-see”’), friend, colleague and ‘a family’ inwhat may have been a professional encounter (‘I had a distressing meeting with a family inthis circumstance a few days ago’). Sometimes more general references to ‘people I know of’were wielded to counter arguments that intersex/DSD is extremely rare.Overall evaluation of the German lawAround a ﬁfth of comments were speciﬁc in their praise of the law (‘good’, ‘well done’, ‘nota day too soon’, ‘common sense’), outnumbering speciﬁcally critical ones (‘rubbish’, ‘mad-ness’, ‘a laugh’) by over two to one. Comments in praise of the law could be divided intotwo types. The ﬁrst included those describing it as a ‘sensible’ solution to a practical prob-lem: ‘To all of you judging this a stupid: Imagine how it would be for you if it were yourown child. Done? Thought so’. The rationale was that parents and doctors should not beforced to make rushed decisions; that surgery based on ‘guesswork’ about the most ‘appropri-ate’ sexual organs should not be imposed on those unable to consent; and that individualsshould be able to choose their sex/gender (both terms were used) when they were old enough:‘Hippocratic oath says ﬁrst do no harm, aka, engage brain before cutting newborn for thesake of burocracy’. Most such commentators believed the child would behave or identify asmale or female with time: ‘as they get older they will veer towards one sex or the other’.Only a very small number suggested that ‘a dominant gender [might not] prevail’. The secondmain type of positive comment praised the law as ‘progressive’, tending to focus on broadersocietal issues ‘[it] is a small step towards a more general acceptance that the gender is notstrictly deﬁned by the body it’s in’; ‘Next, no gender labels except the ones we chose as indi-viduals’.Among the critical comments were some expressing incomprehension about the need for aruling: ‘What’s the point in this? The only genders are male or female’; ‘The common senseview of course is. . . Two bloody genders’; ‘Ridiculous – they either have a Y chromosome ornot – end of story. The sooner people stop thinking that gender is a matter of choice the© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHILSex category ambiguity in online debate 7better’. A small number thought the law was unnecessary as it would apply to so few people.A larger group of critics regarded it as evidence of an overly liberal or ‘sick’ society: ‘Anentirely new category they can investigate to check for discrimination, demand new resources,protect their jobs’. A few, however, criticised the new law for not going far enough, ‘Thereneeds to be a ban with possible prison sentencing for any one that takes part on bringing ascalp[el] near a child’s genitals’. Other critical comments came from those who felt the newlaw would not solve practical problems, ‘Words are just words. They will still have to choosewhich toilet to go in’; ‘adding a new ‘gender’ don’t solve the problems, it add another com-plexities’.Discussing and disputing statistics and ‘facts’The statement in the BBC article that ‘As many as one in 2,000 people have characteristics ofboth sexes’ prompted discussion. Some accepted the ﬁgure, generally expressing surprise (‘Ihad no idea it was so common’) or relating it to other disorders (‘the % of people born withthis. . . is higher than that of those born blind’). Although these commentators generally sug-gested the German law was justiﬁed, some thought ‘a whole new category’ for such a smallpercentage of the population was unreasonable. Only two comments questioned the ﬁgure astoo low, referring to Intersex Society of North America website ﬁgures of 1 in 100 newbornswith bodies differing ‘from standard male and female’. Far more suggested the ﬁgure was toohigh. Some simply could not believe it, apparently assuming that intersex/DSD would be obvi-ous to all in the social networks of those affected (‘I ﬁnd that hard to believe or we would allknow someone like this’) or noted that the BBC wording of ‘as many as. . .’ implied the num-ber born with intersex/DSD was probably (much) smaller. Some responses to these ‘too high’comments quoted statistics on various disorders. Others noted that not all those with intersex/DSD required surgery or were easily identiﬁable: ‘you pass these people every day in thestreet, but they don’t advertise it’. An alternative set of responses suggested issues of preva-lence were less relevant than issues of sensitive treatment: ‘Even if it only affected 1 in50,000 babies this [the German law] would be the sensible thing to do’.Almost one in ten comments included debate about ‘facts’ relating to chromosomes and thebiology of sex and intersex/DSD. Many were responses to essentialist suggestions early in thethread that people are either ‘male or female. Fact’ or that ‘one DNA test can reveal whetheryou are male or female within the hour’. A few expressed surprise that this was not the case:‘I thought there were only boys and girls’; others wondered how a third gender would be dis-tinguished at birth. Some of these comments included the general idea that people are ‘bornhermaphrodites’, thus ‘medically both genders’ and that ‘biological sex is just not as cut anddried as people think’. Others included more speciﬁc details, referencing, recommending orincluding links to various websites.Most commonly, such comments noted chromosomal combinations other than XX or XY:‘one X only (turner syndrome – under-developed female), XXY (Klinefelters – looks malewith female characteristics)’. Similar comments suggested ‘chromosomes are only part of theequation’, that hormonal inﬂuences (‘the androgen bath’) also determine whether a child isborn male or female, that genes may be switched on or off, chromosomes may not ‘behave asnormal’ or that ‘you can have some cells with a Y and some without in the same body’. Therewas mention of early foetal sexual differentiation, anatomical similarities between male andfemale genitalia and comments that while someone might appear ‘normal’ they could haveatypical internal sexual organs: ‘if you happen to be born with a penis but also ovaries and avagina’.© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHIL8 Helen Sweeting et al.Binary categorisationsThere was more general debate around the binary male-female categorisation, encapsulated inone comment, ‘as it was, and always will be boys and girls’. Some suggested that those withintersex/DSD do not constitute a third gender since this would require ‘sexual attributes thatare neither male nor female’, but rather both (‘checkmark both boxes’) or neither (‘is it. . .‘none of the above’?’). Many drew distinctions between sex and gender (‘Your SEX is deﬁnedby your chromosomes. . . Your GENDER is what you want it to be’ [capitals in original]; ‘Sexis the correct term. penis = male vagina = female something that looks odd = Intersex. . . butgender is established in the brain’). A smaller number discussed social roles (‘social gender’;‘a social construct’). Some also suggested that there are already more than two genders whileothers proposed that gender is, or should be, ‘a sliding scale’. For a small group, such sugges-tions were laughable. These commentators derided the BBC (‘people are formed in many gen-ders. . . this is our faith and we ask the bbc to respect it’), recalled old ‘jokes’ (‘They’re goingto have three children, one of each’), or made up new ‘jokes’ of their own (‘‘Bizarre’ mightbe a good choice for a name in the circumstances’).Almost one in ten comments related to the practical implications, most frequently choice oftoilet, changing rooms, names and how those with intersex/DSD might be referred to, clothingcolour or type, room d\u0002ecor. They also referred to the possibility of bullying, the implicationsof ‘X’ on a passport and how such individuals would be categorised for sports participation.Most of these were framed as questions (ﬂippant or serious), for example, ‘[toilet] seat up orseat down?’, ‘how would we refer to a third gender respectfully since ‘it’ is used for inanimateobjects, but we are referring to a person?’ Some of these questions generated practicalresponses including all-cubicle unisex toilets, and gender-neutral names. Others used theirresponse to make more general points relating to the need for binary distinctions, ‘is thereANY circumstance in the modern world where biological gender really matters?’, or reasonsfor their perpetuation, ‘children are very able to understand until the adults have taught themto hate anyone different’. A small number were stronger: ‘Maybe they need to create a newtoilet to keep bigots and racist people separate’.Around one in ten comments also questioned the necessity of sex or gender-based categori-sations, which they perceived as constructing those with intersex/DSD as a societal problem.This group did not share the view that ‘a third gender is creepy and unnatural’, but located‘the problem’ as societal: ‘the problem is not them but our acceptance of what they are’.Within these comments was discussion of what was ‘natural’ and ‘normal’, with commentatorssuggesting that biology or ‘nature. . . produces people like this’ so, although they are unusual,they could not be ‘unnatural’. In response to those suggesting that although natural, it was a‘mistake’ and thus a ‘deformity’ or disability, since such people ‘cannot spawn young’, a verysmall number invoked the idea of forms different from those expected by society. Morebroadly, this group viewed ‘unnecessary’ ‘genital mutilation’ of newborns to conform to ‘igno-rant and prejudiced’ societal expectations as unethical. It thus followed that postponing cate-gorisations until the child was old enough for ‘individual choice’ was morally and practicallypreferable. Most who referred to those with intersex/DSD in this context appeared to assumethe eventual choice would be between male or female, thus ‘keep[ing] the categories as perthe original divine blueprint’. However, many discussed the issues more generally, advocatingremoval of ‘male’ and ‘female’ from ofﬁcial documents and suggesting that, apart from certainmedical issues, there is no legal or ofﬁcial ‘need [to] know what is between any individual’slegs’. Like racial, religious or other labels, ‘ludicrous classiﬁcations’ based on sex/gender wereportrayed as reinforcing discrimination. These commentators argued that in an egalitarian soci-ety, we are all simply people: ‘HB denoting human being could be the answer on all birth cer-tiﬁcates’. Some suggested that increased publicity and discussion of such issues would reduce© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHILSex category ambiguity in online debate 9prejudice on the basis of sex/gender and sexuality distinctions and that questioning binary cat-egorisations was therefore ‘the human race edging forward sociologically’.Religion and politicsAround one in ﬁve comments made reference to religion; one-third of these made no mentionof anything related to the BBC story, most were very general and the only religion explicitlymentioned was Christianity. The most directly relevant were in response to two early com-ments: ‘God created WOMEN from the rib of MAN. God did NOT create another gender.THIS IS BLASPHEMY’ and ‘This will just confuse the children even more. Look to the LordGod our Savior and let Him decide. Man should not be making these sorts of decisions’.Although some suggested these commentators might be trolls,6 most suggested children withintersex/DSD should be treated with compassion, that the Bible is not a biology textbook andthat the German ruling aimed to prevent adults from making premature decisions (‘“playingGod” and imposing a sex on them at birth’), allowing a gender to emerge. Many suchresponses also made more general comments about religion or expressed distress at extremereligious comments.A number of commentators made speciﬁc reference to the fact that this law had been passedin Germany. A small minority were pejorative, invoking Germany’s history, for example, sug-gesting that perhaps children were born with intersex/DSD in Germany because of previous‘dabbling with the Aryan dream’. However, the vast majority portrayed Germany as progres-sive, brave, humanitarian, and a country that could be trusted ‘to do this logically’, in contrastto their ‘dinosaur’ UK or US political counterparts. Several suggested that because the Germanlanguage includes masculine, feminine and neuter nouns, with babies and children usuallyreferred to as neuter, it was somehow ‘already set up to deal with this’.Somewhat related politically themed comments condemned the law as a liberal waste ofresources, ‘left wing appeasement politically correct nonsense’ and a few extended this criti-cism to the BBC, ‘the BBC diversity bell must be ring ring ringing’. However, again suchcomments were countered by suggestions that a ‘sensible’ or ‘humane’ idea was not necessar-ily left-wing, minority issues may nevertheless be very important and intersex/DSD should notbe politicised.‘Conversations’ and threadsTwo of the ﬁve most proliﬁc commentators (Alpharius and Inglewood Jack) were critical ofthe German law. Alpharius (18 comments) entered 18 separate ‘conversations’, ﬁve respondingto others, arguing against ‘modern feminism’, suggesting ‘intersex children are malformed.They should be helped [and] allowed to decide their true gender, but they aren’t a magicalthird gender that should be celebrated’ and ‘The correct and true should be LGBTQIDZTRS-FEDSCJGSLSCUFK8GJF31000101010 so that all minority groups are represented from les-ban to robosexuals’. Most of Alpharius’ unprompted comments were removed by themoderator. InglewoodJack (17 comments) engaged in 14 ‘conversations’ in which he arguedagainst ‘trying to be special’ and described himself as ‘100% male . . . By birth By choice Byaction By stereotype By every metric I have’. His unprompted comments referred, apparentlyfacetiously, to those ‘trapped in the wrong gender body’ and questioned comments favouringthe German law.Mayna, the most proliﬁc commentator, was responsible for 26 comments in 18 separate‘conversations’, 14 of which were replies arguing for acceptance of diversity and makingstrong anti-religious points. Mayna’s unprompted comments raised issues relating to embryonicsexual differentiation and respectful ways to refer to a third gender and asked why so manywere concerned about the German law: ‘with the exception of the person themselves, does this© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHIL10 Helen Sweeting et al.actually change anything for the general public – no’. The 13 separate ‘conversations’ involv-ing Bill Walker (14 comments), seven responding to others and six unprompted, were veryvaried, but largely positive about the German law. He described a colleague who had genderreassignment surgery, non-gender-speciﬁc names, asked about toilet choice, discussed evolu-tion (‘sorry Bible bashers’), embryo development and the ability of other species to changesex, and suggested Alpharius was ‘a male with a severe attitude problem’. Peter_Sym (13comments) was involved in 10 conversations, three involving several interactions. Only hisﬁrst comment was unprompted, responding to the thread so far: ‘Even by HYS [have yoursay] standards the medically ignorant and god deluded are out in force’. In responding toothers he established his credentials as a ‘scientiﬁc’ commentator, posited that some correctivesurgery may be preferable at in children very young ages, suggested children who are neithermale nor female would ﬁnd school difﬁcult, provided information on chromosomal abnormali-ties and cloning (‘I do have a degree in genetics and a masters in clinical biochemistry’) andjoined in a satirical religious discussion (‘My favourite sport is baiting literal bible fans’).Almost one in ten comments made general reference to those of others, over a quarter sug-gesting astonishment or sadness at the tone of comments or low levels of knowledge dis-played. A few speciﬁcally commented on such comments, ‘This HYS is like a circus. Let’shelp you ALL out a bit. To the left. . . 1 in 2000 have these kind of issues at birth?? Rubbish,Bull, Lies. To the right. . . You can do DNA tests all day long, and no matter what the resultsthe person STILL has both characteristics, your test changes nothing. And to the religious. . .keep on commenting, absolutely hilarious’, while others questioned the need to respond at all,‘why do people who are not affected by this get so bothered about it?’DiscussionComments on the ‘Germany allows ‘indeterminate’ gender at birth’ article focus on an issuewhich has occupied much academic debate: ‘a simple question: why must we have a sex?’(Hester 2004b: 223). The fact that over 800 comments were posted in under 12 hours, and thedisputatious nature of those comments suggests that while the question might appear simple,the answers are controversial (Mishne and Glance 2006), provoking vested interests, discom-fort and even anger raised by challenges to the often tacit taken-for-granted assumption thathumans conform to a binary sex categorisation. Our intention in analysing these commentswas to explore how discourse reﬂecting Western essentialist beliefs about the binary nature ofsex is maintained in debates conducted in online public spaces. The points made by manycommentators paralleled those in the academic literature to a striking degree. While binarybeliefs were voiced, often very strongly, it was something of a surprise that these were out-weighed, and strongly disputed, by those with opposing views.Those expressing an opinion in relation to surgery were almost unanimously consistent withprevailing views (Davis 2015) and the Chicago Consensus (Houk et al. 2006, Lee et al. 2006)in suggesting delaying ‘unnecessary genital surgery to an age of patient informed consent’(Houk et al. 2006: 755). As several authors point out, most adults with intersex/DSD believeraising a child as a third (or no) gender is socially challenging and suggest it is not genderassignment per se, but associated medical interventions, shame and secrecy which are theproblem (Bishop 2007, Davis 2015, Dreger and Herndon 2009, Hegarty and Chase, 2000,Rubin 2012). This was recognised by the many commentators who raised both practical andstigma-related issues relating to the legislation. Many expressed the view that at some point,maleness or femaleness would emerge via behaviour or individual self-identiﬁcation,© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHILSex category ambiguity in online debate 11‘reﬂecting common perceptions of sex/gender as an immutable binary biological reality’ (Liaoet al. 2012: 597).Commentators debated the meaning of ‘natural’ and ‘normal’ (something can occur rarelybut still be natural) in the same way that Sax (2002) takes Fausto-Sterling (2000) to task forusing the word ‘natural’ synonymously with ‘normal’. Again, paralleling academic literature(Chau and Herring 2002, Gough et al. 2008, Kessler 1990, Monro 2007, Preves 2002), manyonline commentators took the discussion a stage further, raising the possibility of removingsocietal binary male-female distinctions or seeing maleness–femaleness as a continuum.The extreme discomfort with such ideas shown by some highlights entrenched inclinationsto categorise people as either male or female, and the self-reinforcing way in which the binarysystem has become viewed as natural (Dreger and Herndon 2009, Hester 2004b), so naturalthat it is taken for granted to the point of invisibility. For these commentators, sex is scientiﬁ-cally discoverable, akin to the mistaken scientiﬁc belief during the 1950s of the ‘Barr body’ asindicating the ‘presence or absence of a female sex chromosome constitution’ (Miller 2006:260). For this group, those with intersex/DSD are ‘a symbol of boundary blurring: of theanomalous, the unclean, the tainted, the morally inept or corrupt, indeed, the ‘monsters’ of thecultural imagination’ (Herdt 1993: 17). The reaction of commentators who perceive peoplewith intersex/DSD as threatening prevailing societal values is one of moral panic (Cohen2002).Our analysis suggests the importance of personal experience, either in terms of knowingsomeone with intersex/DSD (reported by only a few commentators) or assumed factual knowl-edge, on attitudes. The former is consistent with proposals that intergroup contact can reduceprejudice (contact theory), with a meta-analysis showing the largest effects in respect of con-tact between heterosexuals and gay men and lesbians (Pettigrew and Tropp 2006). There wasalso evidence of the martialling of arguments in favour of existing beliefs, as would be pre-dicted by cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger 1957). Comments in respect of Germany area good example: those in favour of the German law linked it to being a progressive, humani-tarian country; those against linked it to negative aspects of Germany’s history. Similarly,those referring to religion (speciﬁcally Christianity) emphasised either its compassionateaspects or biblical passages relating to the creation of males and females. There was noacknowledgement of the existence of non-binary alternatives in some other (non-Western) cul-tures (Lang and Kuhnle, 2008).Despite doubts by some editors as to their value (Hermida and Thurman 2008), digital com-ments have been described as ‘grassroots journalism’, allowing public expression and partici-pation in news-making to a far greater extent than previously possible through channels suchas letters to newspaper editors (Bou-Franch 2013, Brossoie et al. 2012, Diakopoulos and Naa-man 2011, J€onsson and €Ornebring 2011). Research based on content analysis of such com-ments is in its infancy, compared with content analysis of the ‘authoritative’ voice oftraditional news media (Freeman 2011, Markens 2012) or other aspects of online commenting(Brossoie et al. 2012). However, such analysis provides insight into lay understandings andviews around the issues involved (Koteyko et al. 2013), in this case, sex/gender as binary andoverlapping or distinct constructs.One study categorised motives for online news comment-writing as being variously informa-tion (for example, educating others, answering or asking questions), personal identity (express-ing intense emotion or opinion), entertainment (humour, debate) and social interaction (forexample, gauging community reactions, persuading others) (Diakopoulos and Naaman, 2011).All were evident in the comments analysed here. A study of online BBC discussions foundmost posts contained negative emotions and the most proliﬁc posters expressed negative views(Chmiela et al. 2011).© 2016 The Authors. Sociology of Health & Illness published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Foundation for SHIL12 Helen Sweeting et al.Previous analyses of comments to online news stories have described them as frequentlyprovocative, aggressive, negative, impolite, insensitive, racist or sexist, albeit countered bythoughtful commentators who provide a ‘voice of reason’ (Diakopoulos and Naaman, 2011:136), ask questions, offer different views and challenge socially unacceptable statements (Bey-ers, 2004, Brossoie et al. 2012, Markens, 2012, Neurauter-Kessels, 2011). Again, our ﬁndingsare consistent with this and reveal the ‘multiparty’ (Bou-Franch, 2013) nature of such com-ments.The relatively few studies of reader comments have taken different methodologicalapproaches, including quantitative analysis of word frequencies (Koteyko et al. 2013), detaileddiscourse analysis of a relatively small number of comments (Bou-Franch 2013) and contentanalysis of themes and patterns in the material (Brossoie et al. 2012, Freeman 2011), theapproach predominantly taken in our analysis. However, to do this without acknowledging theinteractional nature of the data would be to miss something, and we detected individuals withopposing views and different styles, from repeated comments making the same point, to a farmore varied range of comments from one person. Future studies might investigate whetherfocusing on the ‘conversations’ of proliﬁc commentators is an effective way to quickly identifythe main themes and commentary styles in material such as this.As with all such analyses, limitations can be identiﬁed, most importantly that commentatorsare identiﬁed by usernames. Apart from those who speciﬁcally highlighted some aspect oftheir identity (for example, particular area of expertise or personal knowledge of an individualwith intersex/DSD), we know nothing about them or their location (Neurauter-Kessels 2011).We do know they were responding to a story in the UK’s most used online news source(Ofcom 2013), but, perhaps signiﬁcantly, relatively few commenting on the story said theyhad been previously unaware of people with intersex/DSD. In contrast, the few studies of par-ents of children born with intersex/DSD highlight their absence of knowledge (Gough et al.2008), suggesting the commentators were unusual in knowing about the issue or were unwill-ing to admit their ignorance to their presumed audience. However, it has been suggested that,despite the fact that commentators are writing for an audience and free to play with identityand deceive: ‘these ‘fabrications’ still tell us something about the manner in which speciﬁcsocial and cultural ideas . . . are constructed’ (Hookway 2008: 97).Our starting-point was an interest in online responses to a challenge to binary ‘sex-classplacement’ (Goffman 1977) in a context of rising societal openness to a range of sexual identi-ties (Roen 2004), growing medical and scientiﬁc knowledge of the aetiology and classiﬁcationof intersex/DSD (Davies et al. 2011), and increasing information availability and connected-ness between people with intersex/DSD afforded by the Internet (Davis 2015, Kerry 2011).Despite the limitations outlined above, the animated and at times almost visceral commentsand debate for and against the German law suggest that social classiﬁcations as male orfemale, even if questioned, remain fundamental in the early 21st century. Davis suggests:[T]he interactional level of gender structure is where relationships and expectations concern-ing gender are formed. It’s also where individuals reinforce or challenge the gender struc-ture, with assistance or resistance from others.(2015: 117)We argue that our analysis of these comments provides a succinct demonstration of theseexpectations and processes in action.© 2016 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Despite academic feminist debate over several decades, the binary nature of sex as a (perhaps the) primary social classification is often taken for granted, as is the assumption that individuals can be unproblematically assigned a biological sex at birth. This article presents analysis of online debate on the BBC news website in November 2013, comprising 864 readers' responses to an article entitled ‘Germany allows ‘indeterminate’ gender at birth’. It explores how discourse reflecting Western essentialist beliefs about people having one sex or ‘the other’ is maintained in debates conducted in this online public space. Comments were coded thematically and are presented under five sub-headings: overall evaluation of the German law; discussing and disputing statistics and ‘facts’; binary categorisations; religion and politics; and ‘conversations’ and threads. Although for many the mapping of binary sex onto gender was unquestionable, this view was strongly disputed by commentators who questioned the meanings of ‘natural’ and ‘normal’, raised the possibility of removing societal binary male-female distinctions or saw maleness–femaleness as a continuum. While recognising that online commentators are anonymous and can control their self-presentation, this animated discussion suggests that social classifications as male or female, even if questioned, remain fundamental in public debate in the early 21st century",
