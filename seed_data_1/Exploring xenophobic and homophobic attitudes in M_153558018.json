Adopting Fairclough’s three-dimensional framework (1995), we start off by presenting the values that underlielocal discriminatory attitudes as social practice, as these were identified by theparticipants of four focus group interviews that were conducted at the University ofMalta. In this respect, while xenophobia seems to be a far more pressing issue inMalta, homophobia, which is still also present, is taken to be predominantlytriggered by deep-rooted religious beliefs and allegiance to heteronormative values.Then, when it comes to xenophobia, the main relevant trigger seems to be theperceived threat that the different collective background of a particular subset ofmigrants in Malta poses to the local culture. In an attempt to show that these valuescan also be discerned by examining even the most basic textual characteristics of adataset comprising xenophobic and homophobic talk in the local context, we turn toidentify them by looking at quantitative measures pertaining to lexical choice andmetaphorical extension in the relevant parts of our corpus. In this way, we provideevidence for the fundamental – for Critical Discourse Analysis – claim that thetextual analysis of a relevant dataset can indeed reveal the axiological frameworkthat underlies the negative stance that the general population may have in relation toparticular minorities, showcasing the relevance of discourse analytic methods for thebroader understanding of discrimination and hate speech.KeywordsCritical Discourse Analysis, identity construction, discriminatory discourse, newsportal comments, lexical choice, metaphor, hate speech, migrants, LGBTIQ, hatespeechAuthenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AM180 Stavros Assimakopoulos and Rebecca Vella MuskatExploring xenophobic and homophobic attitudes in Malta through the analysisof online comments to news stories1 Introduction“The centrality of language as a means of social construction” (Teo 2000: 11) has beenconsistently acknowledged by researchers in the area of Critical Discourse Analysis,which offers researchers tools that will enable them to observe how and why certaindiscourses are produced in a particular social context, by identifying the textual elementsthat contribute to the construction of particular ideologies. As Fairclough furtherelucidates, “critical approaches differ from non-critical approaches in not just describingdiscursive practices, but also showing how discourse is shaped by relations of power andideologies, and the constructive effects discourse has upon social identities, socialrelations and systems of knowledge and belief, neither of which is normally apparent todiscourse participants” (Fairclough 1992: 12). In this vein, the present paper seeks touncover the mechanisms of identity construction framed within a discourse of Us vs.Them in the context of migrant and LGBTIQminorities in Malta.Following on from the observation that, much like all other forms of discrimination,“racism is socially learned, and discourse is essential in the process of its ideologicalproduction and reproduction” (van Dijk 1995: 3), we attempt to pinpoint the main valuesthat underlie the aforementioned ideological constructions, as these are perceived bymembers of the general population, in the language used in the comment sections ofonline news portals in Malta. The upshot of our argument is that both the ideologicalconstruction of minorities as out-groups and some of the main underlying reasons for itcan be straightforwardly identified through an analysis of even the most basic textualelements of representative samples from the relevant discourse. In our case, these samplesare online comments that express a negative attitude towards migrants and LGBTIQpersons in Malta, which are included in the corpus of local news portal articles andcomments that we compiled and analysed for the purposes of the EU co-fundedC.O.N.T.A.C.T. project.1Our overall argumentation in this paper is to be placed within Fairclough’s tripartitemodel (detailed in Fairclough 1995, among many other publications by the same author),according to which discourse is best viewed as a concept that places texts withindiscursive and social practices. And the placement of discourse in the particulardiscursive practice of engaging in online commentary is extremely important given ourpresent aim. In this regard, the choice to focus on online comments made by the generalpublic in reaction to news stories pertaining to LGBTIQ and migration issues, rather thanthe stories themselves, as several scholars before us have done, was certainly notcoincidental. We believe that this particular kind of computer-mediated communicationnaturally lends itself to critical analyses of the ideological stances that underliediscrimination for various reasons. For one, the internet is a prime location for thediscovery of discriminatory discourse; as Josey asserts, it “represents one of the few safe1For further information about the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. project, visit http://reportinghate.eu.Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AMLodz Papers in Pragmatics 13.2 (2017): 179–202 181Special issue on The pragmatics of othering: Stereotyping, hate speech and legitimising violenceDOI:10.1515/lpp-2017-0010spaces for extremely divergent opinions on race, politics and society”, since “as adecentralized media, controlled by the end user, it has allowed a resurgence in thesolidarity and power building of hate-based groups” (2010: 37). Along the same lines,“numerous authors2have pointed to the increase of hate speech in news websites’comments and have emphasized the need for analyses of hate speech in news websites’comments” (Erjavec and Kovačič 2012: 900). Then, the relevant discourse enables us toaccess the opinions of the general public in a form that is usually unfiltered, whencompared to these opinions being reported by a journalist. Even barring the deletion ofsome comments by the relevant portals’ moderators, the posting of comments withcontroversial content is often allowed “as a means of keeping old and attracting new usersof online news media” (Erjavec and Kovačič 2012: 901). Finally, and perhaps mostimportantly, the casual nature of the language used by most commentators is more proneto spontaneously express the writer’s true feelings when compared to an opinion articlethat has been carefully proofed prior to publication. All in all, we think that it is preciselybecause of the language used in online comments to news stories being a “written-spokenhybrid” (Rowe 2009: 85) akin to that used in social media communications, that even asuperficial analysis of its basic textual characteristics can provide significant insights intothe ideological background of its writer.3Against this backdrop, in this paper, we will follow a practice that may seem ratherunconventional when it comes to reporting research in Critical Discourse Analysis; wewill be moving from the (public perception of the) level of social practice to the level oftextual analysis. This will be done with a view to showing that the broader ideologicalstances held in relation to discriminatory attitudes can indeed be revealed to aconsiderable extent through the analysis of even the most general textual characteristics ofa particular type of discourse, as long as this discourse comprises spontaneous talk thatmirrors the general sentiment of a particular population. To this end, our starting pointwill be the focus group interviews that we conducted at the University of Malta towardsthe end of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. project. While both our analysis of online comments inreaction to news stories in the domains under question and the local administration of aquestionnaire on hate speech/crime preceded these interviews, what soon became evidentwhile analysing the obtained interview data was that the discussion that took place duringthe focus group interviews independently corroborates our findings in relation to localdiscriminatory discourse targeting the two groups at hand. So, after identifying the mainthemes pertinent to identity construction that arose during the interviews, we will turn toshow how they can also be independently revealed through the examination of lexicalchoice and metaphorical extension in online comments to local news stories thatcommunicate a negative stance towards the two minorities under question. In this respect,the present paper is best seen as an effort to provide some concrete evidence for the2See, for example, Cammaerts (2009), Domingo et al.

The relevant survey, to which 209participants responded, followed the common C.O.N.T.A.C.T. methodology (cf. Millar etal. 2017), and asked participants to rate six examples of discriminatory comments foundin reaction to news articles in the local press in terms of their acceptability, before offeringthem a chance to share their own experiences as witnesses, or even targets of suchdiscourse in Malta and eventually comment on their perceived applicability of differentdefinitions of hate speech in a legal setting.5During the subsequent focus groupinterviews, which also followed the semi-structured format prescribed by the commonproject methodology (cf. ibid), participants were encouraged to discuss the resultsobtained from the survey and hypothesise about the reasons why they think these were so.Crucially, no information about the previous part of the research that involved theanalysis of online comments to news portal stories was divulged to participants duringthese interviews. All in all, 4 focus group interviews with 21 participants, 11 female and10 male, were conducted for this strand of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. research. Sixteen of theparticipants were below 35 years of age, which was the target group according to thecommon methodology. Our focus groups comprised 13 Maltese, 6 EU and 2 non-EUnationals, and in terms of occupation, 10 interviewees were students, 4 academics and 2employed in administrative positions at the University of Malta. Out of the remaining 5participants, 2 were artists, with the rest being a computer programmer, a marketingconsultant and a taxi driver respectively.6All focus group interviews, which lasted on4For a discussion of this assumption over and above Fairclough’s framework, with a special focuson the relevant concept of triangulation in the discourse-historical approach, see Wodak and Meyer(2009).5For a presentation and discussion of the collected questionnaire responses, see AssimakopoulosandVellaMuskat (2017: 22–36).6Apart from the usual restrictions involved in the recruitment of interview participants, in terms ofthe researchers’ access to particular groups of participants and the participants’ availability itself, thedemographics of our group for this study aimed at matching as much as possible the demographicsof the respondents to the Maltese C.O.N.T.A.C.T. questionnaire that preceded it. In light of this, weAuthenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AMLodz Papers in Pragmatics 13.2 (2017): 179–202 183Special issue on The pragmatics of othering: Stereotyping, hate speech and legitimising violenceDOI:10.1515/lpp-2017-0010average 45 minutes each, were recorded using unobtrusive audio equipment and thentranscribed in order to facilitate further analysis.Overall, there was broad consensus amongst our interviewees that xenophobia is a fargreater issue than homophobia in Malta. While this is a conclusion that had also arisenduring all the previous stages of our research, what we will be focusing on in this sectionare the main reasons to which our interview participants attributed this observation.7Thiswill then enable us to turn, in the following section, to the textual features of our collectedcorpus of online comments that communicate a negative attitude towards the minoritiesunder question with a view to showing how the particular values that emerged during thefocus group interviews can also be independently revealed through them.2.1 Emerging ideological valuesAs already mentioned above, most of our interviewees seemed to be in agreement withthe general conclusions of the Maltese strand of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. research, since theyconfirmed that, in their experience, homophobia has become less of an issue locally inrecent years, while xenophobia is steadily following the opposite trend.[Discussing a comment in relation to the LGBTIQ community]…I think it shows as well thatpeople inMalta are less homophobic than they are racist.(Interviewee 3, Focus Group 1)…I think here in Malta, I mean, we've come a long way and I'm not saying that the Maltesepeople are less homophobic now, but I mean, the numbers usually show that there's more,there's a problem with racism here in Malta than homophobia. I don't mean that there isn't aproblem with homophobia by any means but, I mean, the numbers show that uh regardinghomophobia there are more non acceptable results than there are in the xenophobia…(Interviewee 6, Focus Group 2)The most prevalent reason provided by our interviewees regarding this trend was that whilethe migrant minority comprises individuals who are commonly thought to have nothing incommon with theMaltese in-group, most members of the LGBTIQ group are still consideredto be part of it, by virtue of sharing the same nationality with its members, even though theyadditionally form part of their ownminority too.purposefully recruited more female than male participants, as well as more participants of Maltesedescent or of higher education experience than not [for demographic information about thequestionnaire respondents, cf. Assimakopoulos andVellaMuskat (2017: 22–23)].7Other issues that were discussed during the focus group interviews, but which go beyond the scopeof the present paper, included the interviewees’ experience with discriminatory discourse as well astheir thoughts about what actually constitutes hate speech and whether and how it should beregulated (cf. Assimakopoulos and VellaMuskat 2017: 36–44).Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AM184 Stavros Assimakopoulos and Rebecca Vella MuskatExploring xenophobic and homophobic attitudes in Malta through the analysisof online comments to news stories…it's sort of like […] immigrants are external, an external part of us sort of. Whilehomosexuals are an internal part.(Interviewee 21, Focus Group 4)…the homophobic issue […] also affects a lot of families because a lot of families have oneor two of their children or someone from their family who’s part of that minority group, sothey are more likely to defend that minority group […]. Very few families actually have achild or a member of the family who’s from Asia or from an Arabic country, for example, soit's more of an 'us' and 'them' mentality while homophobia is more of a ‘they're part of us,they're stillMaltese at the end of the day’…(Interviewee 1, Focus Group 1)…people are coming out of their shells, like 'hey I'm gay' ok, so now it's acceptable. And nowfamilies, like Maltese families, they have family members who are also gay, so they'vebecome more acceptable. So, that's closer to home I guess, because they're part of us, they'reour family. So, ok, we can accept them, but they're from another culture, they're Arabs,Muslim…(Interviewee 5, Focus Group 1)In this setting, examples (4) and (5) also indirectly serve to illustrate an additionalconclusion that was also reached through the collective research that we carried out underthe auspices of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. project; that is, that most xenophobic discourseidentified in the local context appears to predominantly target a particular sub-group ofthe migrant minority in Malta: that of migrants of a Muslim persuasion and/or an Arab orAfrican ethnic origin. This much was asserted by several of our interviewees, who alsopointed out that migrants from, say, Western and Northern Europe do not generally facethe same amount of intolerance and discrimination inMalta.…they’re the same, I think, because, maybe in terms of culture, there’s a lot more similaritybetween aMaltese and a European.(Interviewee 1, Focus Group 1)…if you look European, you know, you’re, let's face it, you're just less likely to be the targetof racial slurs, if you're white…(Interviewee 15, Focus Group 3)Overall, this distinction between different groups of migrants in Malta seems to stemfrom the conviction that, while Western and Northern Europeans “blend in” moresuccessfully with the local population, the targeted group of migrants stands out bothphysically and culturally. This, in turn, leads to an often observed conflation of a person’sidentity on grounds of religion, skin colour and ethnicity, whereby one might be a blackEthiopian Christian, but by virtue of being black and African they can easily becategorised asMuslims.Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AMLodz Papers in Pragmatics 13.2 (2017): 179–202 185Special issue on The pragmatics of othering: Stereotyping, hate speech and legitimising violenceDOI:10.1515/lpp-2017-0010Even when you hear people talking about immigrants, they talk about the blacks, while themajority, the major, sorry... the majority of immigrants that come to Malta are actually Arabs.They have the same skin colour as us. Most people actually live next door and they don't evenknow. But when they see a black man for example, they tend to discriminate against them,even on the work place. I've seen this many times.(Interviewee 20, Focus Group 4)…any article about Islam is bound, you know there's a small group of people that spends a lotof time, I think um, commenting on the newspaper…(Interviewee 15, Focus Group 3)…people will not sit next to a black guy on a bus. For example, if there’s nowhere else to sit,theymight just stand.(Interviewee 13, Focus Group 3)[Talking about the local population] …they're more likely to hang out with someone of theopposite sex than someone who's black or someone who's Arab. I mean, it's about who youchoose to sort of hang out with…(Interviewee 18, Focus Group 4)This brings us to the main value that was singled out by our interviewees in relation toxenophobia in Malta, and which seems to revolve around the more general themes ofintegration and multiculturalism. In fact, both the responses collected through ourquestionnaire administration and the discussion that took place during the focus groupinterviews indicated that there is a marked tendency to defend opinions that appear to beprotective of the Maltese culture against other cultures that are perceived to be differentfrom it8. In this vein, multiculturalism might not be negative by virtue of what it standsfor, but becomes undesirable when it seemingly pushes the Maltese culture, as thedominant and most visible culture of the country, to the side, effectively becoming athreat in the conscience of the general population. Therefore, it may be less acceptable todirectly attack a person on the basis of a minority identity, but when one does this tryingto defend and protect one’s culture or even personal prosperity, it is more acceptable touse such rhetoric.“…in the case of the multiculturalism thing, there's also the fact that people feel under threat.Nobody really feels under threat because somebody is gay.” … “Really homophobic peoplefind it scary because it's a matter of thinking of this as unnatural and maybe feeling disgustedby it or whatever reason, but in the case of the multiculturalism this starts getting into, youknow, this is about my job right. This is about my family. it's about money in my pocket.”(Interviewee 15, Focus Group 3)8It should be noted that this is a recurring theme in several studies on the effects of the perceivednational identity to social practice (cf. Triandafyllidou 2000; Reisigl and Wodak 2001; DeBeaugrande 2004; Kopytowska, Woźniak and Grabowski 2017).Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AM186 Stavros Assimakopoulos and Rebecca Vella MuskatExploring xenophobic and homophobic attitudes in Malta through the analysisof online comments to news stories…even for people who are, have no problems with Muslims per se, but then, when you startseeing your, I guess, people feel nervous when they see their neighbourhood beingtransformed um, you know, with the appearance of a mosque for instance, um, they feeluncomfortable with that. So, less people would be inclined to say, you know, that, less peoplewould be inclined to defend immigrants who are calling for these changes.(Interviewee 1, Focus Group 1)[Comparing a comment that provides a general opinion about multiculturalism to a commentthat outright condemns it] …the comments are defending the people who are actually goingto see the comment so they are less likely to say it's a bad comment, while the other one he'sattacking directly the people rather than just analysing the situation from a 'I want to protectmy culture' point of view.(Interviewee 20, Focus Group 4)Along similar lines, the negative stance toward the minorities of migrants targeted mostby xenophobic comments is also likely due to the assumption that they do not appear toassimilate as well into Maltese society as European migrants do, when this is what isexpected by the local population.…it's easier for them [=Europeans] to assimilate, not to integrate. We expect them [=Araband African migrants] to assimilate, not integrate.(Interviewee 3, Focus Group 1)When it comes to the issue of the far less noticeable, but still existent, homophobicattitudes that can be traced in the Maltese context, their main roots, as these wereidentified by our focus group participants, tend to be related to religious concerns, andmore specifically what the general public takes to be the conviction of the churchregarding members of the LGBTIQ community. In this view, people might be lessinclined to mark a comment as discriminatory or hateful if that comment somehowinvolves the church; for, if the comment is in line with the church doctrine, the commentmust be right, or at the very least, make sense.[Discussing the three comments that were included in the local survey in relation tohomophobia] …the third one is more acceptable to people because it's, the context is lessreligious. The other two are religious stories, the first one about the church's commission, andthe second one about um, the Dominican order, but the third one is about legislation, so it maybe that um people find it more acceptable…(Interviewee 4, Focus Group 1)…Cause that's how the majority of Maltese people behave unfortunately.

Insummary, these seem to be: (i) the exclusion of (a particular subset of) the migrantminority from – and parallel inclusion of the LGBTIQ community to – the Maltese in-group; (ii) the perception of multiculturalism, or any attempt to integrate the sameminority for that matter, as an imminent threat to the local culture and the prosperity ofthe Maltese, and (iii) the rejection of the LGBTIQ group on the basis of religiousreservations or the perception of homosexuality as unnatural.3 Investigating discriminatory stances in online comments postedunder news portal storiesHaving identified the main axiological context that, according to our focus groupinterview participants, underlies xenophobic and homophobic attitudes on the Malteseislands, it is now time to turn to show how the particular values that it consists in can alsobe discerned when looking at the textual level of discriminatory statements produced inthe local context. To this end, we will be employing the local corpus of online commentsthat we compiled as part of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. project; a corpus that comprisescomments posted in reaction to articles pertaining to migration and LGBTIQ matters thatwere published in Maltese news portals. But before we turn to the examination of itscontents that interest us, it is essential to briefly outline the procedure followed for thecorpus population and eventual analysis.3.1 Corpus population and analysisIn line, again, with the common C.O.N.T.A.C.T. methodology (cf. Millar et al. in 2017),the samples of data that we collected for the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. project in order to observeAuthenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AM188 Stavros Assimakopoulos and Rebecca Vella MuskatExploring xenophobic and homophobic attitudes in Malta through the analysisof online comments to news storiesand analyse patterns in hate speech and discriminatory discourse pertaining to xenophobiaand homophobia in Malta, comprise news stories and associated comments posted inreaction to them in local news portals9.To begin with, we used the European Media Monitoring tool (henceforth EMM),10aglobal database of online news portals that has been developed by the Joint ResearchCentre of the European Union and allows users to input keyword (or phrase) searcheswithin the limits of specific dates, source countries, languages, and newspapers. As theC.O.N.T.A.C.T. project has been concerned with understanding and analysingxenophobic and homophobic talk, we performed the relevant search for Malta by using anumber of keywords, some of which were agreed upon jointly by the project partners(such as “gay” or “migrant”), with the rest being country-specific, like, for example,“black”, which, while not necessarily a keyword pertaining to migrants in all EUcountries, is particularly relevant in the local context, as it is often used to refer tomigrants on the Maltese islands. The relevant searches were performed over a six-monthperiod that comprised April, May, June and December 2015 as well as January andFebruary 2016, and by the end of this process, we had collected the urls of all articles inMaltese news portals that contained each of the predetermined keywords in theaforementioned time frame.However, not all the articles retrieved through this search got selected for inclusion inour corpus. In order to populate the corpus with a manageable, yet representative enoughsample of articles and associated comments, we selected the 8 keywords that returnedmost hits in the EMM search in each one of the migration and the LGBTIQ domains. Inthis regard, we deviated slightly from the common C.O.N.T.A.C.T. methodology thatprescribed the selection of 8 keywords for migration and 6 for LGBTIQ matters, but wedid so in order to end up with balanced sets of data across the two domains. Against thisbackground, the keywords used to populate the Maltese C.O.N.T.A.C.T corpus were:“gay/s11”, “gender identity”, “homophobia”, “homosexual/s”, “lesbian/s”, “LGBT/IQ”,9Even though we collected and analysed articles and comments from news portals in both Englishand Maltese for the purposes of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. project, the present analysis is based solely onthe content retrieved fromEnglish-language portals. The reason that this decision was made was thatapart from being notably less popular in terms of everyday traffic than their English counterparts,Maltese-language portals also tend to attract far less comments under their stories. So, even afterincluding all retrieved Maltese-language articles with comments and their associated comments inour corpus, we were nowhere near the requisite 5,000-word threshold per keyword in either articlesor comments for any one of the selected keywords. In the interest of basing our presentargumentation on a balanced dataset, we have decided not to use the dataset pertaining to Maltese-language news portals for our present purposes; so, for ease of exposition, we will henceforth bereferring to the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. corpus for Malta, as if it only contains data from English-languageportals.10http://emm.newsbrief.eu11The searches performed with the EMM engine included all keywords in both their singular andplural form (when this is available in language), since each of them often returned different articles.Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AMLodz Papers in Pragmatics 13.2 (2017): 179–202 189Special issue on The pragmatics of othering: Stereotyping, hate speech and legitimising violenceDOI:10.1515/lpp-2017-0010“sexual orientation”, and “transgender/s” for the LGBTIQ domain; and “asylumseeker/s”, “black/s”, “immigrant/s”, “immigration”, “migrant/s”, “Muslim/s”, “race” and“refugee/s” for the migration one. Once we eliminated all articles that included all theremaining keywords from our original search, we went on to order the updated url list onthe basis of the number of comments that had been posted beneath each article within it.Using this number of comments per article as our primary criterion, and after removingfrom the list articles that were irrelevant to the topics under question12, we finallyembarked upon collecting 5,000 words worth of articles, alongside an additional 5,000words worth of associated comments (evenly distributed across the selected articles) perkeyword. Through this process we managed to compile a balanced corpus of articles andassociated comments pertaining to migration and LGBTIQ issues.Table 1: Overview of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. corpus for Malta.DomainNo ofarticles incorpusSize of article subcorpus(in words)No of commentsin corpusSize of commentssubcorpus (inwords)LGBTIQ 80 42273 1109 40924Migration 79 41006 1130 41020Once our corpus was compiled, all articles and comments therein were annotated interms of their evaluative content, following the common C.O.N.T.A.C.T. methodology.In the first instance, each article was marked as communicating a positive, negative orneutral stance towards the minorities under question, and then each one of itsassociated comments in the corpus was also annotated along the same lines. What isparticularly important to note is that during this process, which was independentlyundertaken by both authors of this paper to ensure reliability, we focused exclusivelyon the attitudes expressed in relation to migrants and members of the LGBTIQcommunity, marking any evaluative content related to a different target, such aspoliticians, the church or other commentators, as irrelevant. Once each comment waslabelled in terms of its polarity, the conceptual tactics used by its writer tocommunicate a positive or negative attitude were also identified, following severalcategories established by the joint C.O.N.T.A.C.T. methodology, and exemplified inTable 2 that follows.What, as discussed in footnote 6 above, the same searches were also repeated for the Maltesecounterparts of the keywords under investigation.12Some of the articles retrieved through the EMM search were indeed irrelevant for our presentpurposes. To give a characteristic example, one article that was retrieved under the keyword “black”focused on Darth Vader and the new Star Wars film, which is obviously a topic completelyunrelated to the migration.Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AM190 Stavros Assimakopoulos and Rebecca Vella MuskatExploring xenophobic and homophobic attitudes in Malta through the analysisof online comments to news storiesTable 2: Classification of comment tactics on the basis of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. methodology.Annotated tactic Example from theMaltese corpusAgreement withnegative newsreported“This is only the beginning.

As a quick reminder, themain conclusions reached by our interviewees were: (i) the inclusion of the LGBTIQpersons in the in-group of the local Maltese population and parallel exclusion ofmigrants from it; (ii) the perception of multiculturalism as a threat for the in-group; and(iii) the rejection of the LGBTIQ community on religious and heteronormativegrounds. While the last two conclusions appear to be pertinent to discriminatorydiscourse regarding the targeted minorities alone, the first one is obviously related tothe general attitude that the public has towards the two groups under question. So, inorder to see whether this particular perception of our interviewees matches the dataAuthenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AMLodz Papers in Pragmatics 13.2 (2017): 179–202 191Special issue on The pragmatics of othering: Stereotyping, hate speech and legitimising violenceDOI:10.1515/lpp-2017-0010analysed in our corpus, we will start by looking at the overall results of our analysis forthe two domains.In this regard, as the following pie charts clearly indicate, there may be a presenceof a negative attitude towards both minorities that we are investigating here, but thisattitude is far more prevalent in the case of migrants than it is in that of members of theLGBTIQ community.Evidently, the results regarding xenophobia in Malta seem to be particularlyalarming, as the negative comments in this domain are almost double in number thanthose that express a positive attitude in relation to this particular target group.13What isparticularly notable, however, is that the instances in which a positive attitude towardsthe LGBTIQ minority group was expressed substantially outnumber the correspondingnegative comments. At face value, this indicates that the local population is generallyaccepting of LGBTIQ persons, which indirectly corroborates the opinion provided byour interviewees regarding this minority being commonly perceived as part of the localin-group.24,2%18,7%57,1%LGBTIQ commentsPositiveNegativeNeutral / IrrelevantFigure 1: Results of polarity analysis for comments in the LGBTIQ domain.13Additionally, more negative remarks about migrants, which we have not taken into accounthere due to our methodological constraints, were also found in the LGBTIQ corpus, whichappears to suggest that in some cases xenophobia has a way of entering the picture even inseemingly irrelevant discussions.Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AM192 Stavros Assimakopoulos and Rebecca Vella MuskatExploring xenophobic and homophobic attitudes in Malta through the analysis ofonline comments to news stories16,3%32,3%51,4%Migration commentsPositiveNegativeNeutral /IrrelevantFigure 2: Results of polarity analysis for comments in the Migration domain.With this in mind, we can now turn to see how the xenophobic and homophobicattitudes, and in particular their underlying axiological roots, that were independentlyidentified by the same interview participants can also be pinpointed by looking at thetextual level of the collected negative comments in each of the two domains. Adescription of the two relevant subcorpora can be found in Table 3 that follows.Table 3: Overview of the comments with negative polarity subcorpus for Malta.DomainNo of comments with negativepolarity in corpusSize of comments with negative polaritysubcorpus (in words)LGBTIQ 207 11056Migration 365 152653.3 Identifying axiology in the discriminatory discourse subcorpora3.3.1 Lexical choiceFor the purposes of this subsection, we will turn to analyse our subcorpora of negativecomments for the two domains in terms of lexical choice. In order to analyse them, weloaded the two subcorpora to the freeware corpus analysis toolkit AntConc (Anthony2014), and automatically generated the relevant lists that we will be focusing on in thissection. As we have already noted, the analysis we will be reporting on here will berather superficial, in that it only involves measures of frequency, but we are confidentthat even this alone suffices to show that the relevant values we are seeking to identifyreadily present themselves. All in all, the relevance of lexical choice in both corpuslinguistics and discourse analysis has repeatedly been acknowledged. As far back as theAuthenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AMLodz Papers in Pragmatics 13.2 (2017): 179–202 193Special issue on The pragmatics of othering: Stereotyping, hate speech and legitimising violenceDOI:10.1515/lpp-2017-00101930s, Firth, in his account of lexical semantics, underlined the role that the distributionof lexical items pertinent to a social group plays in particular contexts as a way ofidentifying values associated with it (1935: 40-41). Against this backdrop, “frequency-sorted word lists have long been part of the standard methodology for exploitingcorpora” (Baron et al. 2009: 41). And in the particular setting of investigating emotivelanguage in relation to minorities, lexical choice, so construed, has also been shown tohave a prime bearing on the uncovering of ideology (cf. Baker et al. 2008: Baider 2013;Love and Baker 2015; Baider and Constantinou 2017; Kopytowska et al. 2017).Starting off with an overview of the 15 content words most frequently used in eachof the two subcorpora under investigation, we can easily see that, in the case ofnegative comments towards the LGBTIQ community, religion indeed seems to play acrucial role in the narrative, with “God” and “church” being two of the most commonlyencountered lexical items in the relevant texts – and “Christ” also following not that farbehind (cf. Table 4). Turning to the migrant minority, the frequency list in Table 5 mayonly give an indirect indication that culture plays an important role in the localxenophobic narrative, as the relevant lexical item is not one the most prominent wordsin the list, but the prominence of the words “Malta” and especially “Maltese” serves tosuggest that reference to the local identity is particularly visible when it comes toxenophobic discourse against migrants.What is more, the relative prevalence of the lexical items “Muslim” and “Libya” inTable 5 seems to additionally corroborate another point that was made in relation tolocal xenophobic attitudes; that is, that only a subset of the local migrant populationseems to be the main target of xenophobic statements.That being said, it has often been argued that the frequency of use of a particularlexical item in a corpus on its own is not a reliable measure to establish the saliency ofits associated concept in the relevant discourse. As Pollach asserts, “frequencyinformation is always most informative when corpora from different sources ordifferent times are compared” (2012: 269). In this sense, an alternative measure thatseems to be more reliable is that of keyness, which effectively targets words “whosefrequency is unusually high in comparison with some norm” (Scott 1997: 53), and arethus dubbed “key words”. In order to identify key words in a particular text orcollection of texts, one can establish this “unusual frequency, by comparison with areference corpus of some kind” (Scott, 1997: 236). In our particular setting, thereference corpus used to calculate keyness was that of the articles collected for theC.O.N.T.A.C.T. corpus in each domain. The rationale behind choosing this set of textsas a reference corpus was that by identifying the lexical items that are more prominentin the negative comments in comparison to those that are also contained in the – mainlyneutral – articles of our corpus, we should be able to pinpoint more directly theAuthenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AM194 Stavros Assimakopoulos and Rebecca Vella MuskatExploring xenophobic and homophobic attitudes in Malta through the analysisof online comments to news storiesconcepts that underlie the negative attitude characteristic of the said comments,approximating in this way the values that underlie this attitude even more.14Table 4: Frequency of content words in theLGBTIQ negative comments subcorpus.Expression Frequencygay 68God 50church 39children 34people 33rights 30homosexual 25Christ 21human 21Malta 21want 21good 17man 17normal 17marriage 17Table 5: Frequency of content words in theMigration negative comments subcorpus.Expression Frequencycountry 92Malta 71people 67Maltese 58immigrants 50illegal 45Muslim 45culture 38Europe 35racist 28year 24European 23government 19immigration 18Libya 18Indeed, as Tables 6 and 7 indicate, the conclusions already drawn in our discussionof frequency above seem to be largely on the right track, when taking into account the15 most frequent key words in the two datasets, calculated by log-likelihood. In relationto homophobic attitudes, religion is obviously the single most prominent conceptualcategory in terms of keyness, with “God”, “Christ” and “Bible” being highest in thelist. Then, while “Malta” and “Maltese” do not appear to be key words in the corpus ofnegative comments towards migrants, “culture” still features very high on the list.When coupled with the lexical item “integrate”, it again seems to indicate that theissues of multiculturalism and integration are central to xenophobic attitudes in Malta.14A similar procedure was used in Kopytowska, Grabowski and Woźniak (2017) for the analysisof Polish data on refugees and migrants also collected under the auspices of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T.project.Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AMLodz Papers in Pragmatics 13.2 (2017): 179–202 195Special issue on The pragmatics of othering: Stereotyping, hate speech and legitimising violenceDOI:10.1515/lpp-2017-0010Incidentally, the keyness scores in Table 7, and especially those obtained by the lexicalitems “illegal”, “pushback”15, “Africans” and “desert” provide additional support forthe claim that the main target of xenophobic discourse in our analysed comments is notthe whole population of migrants in the country, but rather the fraction of it thatincludes irregular migrants, typically coming from African or Arab states in turmoil.Table 6: Keyness of content words in theLGBTIQ negative comments subcorpus.Expression KeynessGod 86.355Christ 50.476Bible 31.136normal 29.457everything 29.291male 26.109gay 24.693Professor 22.003like 21.681want 31.670teaching 21.589female 21.491kids 19.688chapter 18.860wrong 17.639Table 7: Keyness of content words in theMigration negative comments subcorpus.Expression Keynessimmigrants 48.497want 47.777illegal 46.424pushback 31.325culture 28.063country 23.718Africans 23.663politicians 18.874desert 18.273UK 18.130integrate 16.331stop 15.822traditions 15.663pay 13.848sad 13.0523.4Metaphorical extensionWhile the content words’ frequency and keyness measures seem to indeed be usefulindicators of the main ideological values that underlie xenophobic and homophobicattitudes in Malta, they do not seem to precisely pinpoint them. Clearly, a morenuanced look at the meanings communicated in the text is necessary to fully uncover15In this setting, the expression “pushback” refers to a policy that was sought to be enforced inMalta in 2013, but never materialised. According to this policy, all asylum seekers arriving inMalta would effectively be redirected back to Libya.Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AM196 Stavros Assimakopoulos and Rebecca Vella MuskatExploring xenophobic and homophobic attitudes in Malta through the analysisof online comments to news storiesthe roots of xenophobia and homophobia in this setting; hence, the C.O.N.T.A.C.T.project’s focus not only on quantitative but also at qualitative analysis. In this vein, theidentification of the linguistic and rhetorical strategies used by the commentators, i.e.what we called tactics in the previous section, can offer significant insights not only inrelation to the main concerns that can lead to the rise of discriminatory attitudes in thegeneral public, but also in relation to the particular forms of expression that can be usedto communicate such attitudes.16Staying in the broader area of lexical meaning, we will now turn to show how thevalues identified by our interviewees as the main roots of xenophobia and homophobiain the Maltese society can also be discerned through the use of metaphors to refer to therelevant minorities in the subcorpora of the Maltese C.O.N.T.A.C.T. corpus we havebeen looking at so far. Our focus on metaphor is, again, not coincidental. Followingfrom Lakoff and Johnson’s conviction that “metaphor is pervasive in everyday life, notjust in language but in thought and action […and that] our ordinary conceptual system,in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature”(2003: 3), several critical discourse analysts of discrimination have shown that anumber of negative metaphors appear to dominate discourse of minority groups (cf.Reisigl and Wodak 2001; Baker et al. 2008; KhosraviNik 2010; Musolff 2015;Kopytowska, Grabowski and Woźniak 2017; Baider and Kopytowska, this issue). Inthis setting, during their selection of words and phrases that will be used to expresstheir opinion, several individuals opt to employ particular metaphorical vehicles thatwill successfully communicate their negative attitude towards a particular minority. AsKhosraviNik, for example, discusses in relation to racist discourse, a number of studieshave shown that “metaphors of aliens, water and natural disasters, pollution andimpurity, war/fighting, house/building, disease/infection, animals, goods and theeconomy are salient to the argumentative structure of [relevant] discourses” (2010: 7).In a similar trend, a quick look at the metaphors present in our two datasets withnegative comments reveals a number of negative metaphors that occur consistentlythroughout the corpus and that corroborate the findings of the lexical analysis and thefocus group interviews described above.So, in the 365 comments that make up the corpus of negative comments targetedtowards migrants, we identified 109 metaphors, which belong to the broad categoriesshown in Table 8. Again, the fact that the most common metaphor in this setting is thatof migrants as invaders serves as further confirmation of the basic root of xenophobiathat was identified in our focus group discussions being the perceived threat thatmigrants constitute for Malta’s culture and its Euro-centric values.16For an extensive discussion of this point, see Assimakopoulos et al. (2017).Authenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AMLodz Papers in Pragmatics 13.2 (2017): 179–202 197Special issue on The pragmatics of othering: Stereotyping, hate speech and legitimising violenceDOI:10.1515/lpp-2017-0010Table 8: Metaphors in theMigration negative comments subcorpus.MetaphorFrequency in the migration negative commentssubcorpusMigrants as invaders 41Migrants as violent/terrorists 31Migrants as opportunists/scroungers 31Migrants as animals 6Table 9: Metaphors in the LGBTIQ negative comments subcorpus.MetaphorFrequency in the LGBTIQ negative commentssubcorpusLGBTIQ persons as pushy 32LGBTIQ persons as abnormal beings 24LGBTIQ persons as perverts 9LGBTIQ persons as sick 7Here are some representative examples of comments that explicitly communicatethis perceived threat through metaphor:The only way to stop this massive African invasion of Europe and save the Africansthemselves is to send back ALL illegal immigrants including those already in Europeto send the message that no matter how many times they try and even if they reachEurope they shall ALL be sent back.I call them PATRIOTIC, but then the word patriotic is a foregone conclusion forsome people who prefer in seeing Malta sink under the mass exodus of these illegalsthen toe the national line!Stop this insanity: help the Libyan police/coastguard to patrol Libya's shores to stopthese illegal activities from becoming rescues at sea.

AsTable 9 indicates, the most common type of metaphor used in these comments may bethat of force, through which commentators express their dismay at LGBTIQorganisations and individuals pushing their own agenda with disregard for the generalpopulation’s received view, but all the remaining metaphors, which collectivelyoutnumber those of force, can be directly linked to the religious concerns noted by ourfocus group interview participants. In this respect, apart from the metaphors ofperversion, which are directly linked to religious ideas, metaphors of unnaturalness –and arguably sickness too – can also be traced back to the Christian rhetorics, in which“gay sexual activity, if not orientation, is not uncommonly rendered a serious ‘sin’: anunnatural, abnormal deviant form of behaviour” (Hunt 2009: 2, emphasis our own).This much is also evident in the following representative examples from our corpustoo:The Church affirms that all human beings are created in God's image. Natural lawmakes it impossible to equate a homosexual relationship to a heterosexualrelationship.God has created humanity and has given it his loving laws for its own benefit.Regarding sexuality, he gave us the Sixth and Ninth Commandments. So, everysexual act outside of marriage is a grave sin that separates the sinner from God andputs them on the path to hell. Consequently, masturbation, homosexuality, adultery,fornication, sodomy, etc are condemned by God as evil acts.That is what the Catholic teaching says and if we are Catholics we cannot justaccommodate to something that God hates or that goes against His teaching!!!The more they get informed about sexuality the more they want to do it. Why don tthe education teach the LGBTQI THE NORMAL way as god wants?4 Concluding remarksClearly, the issue of discriminatory discourse and the topic within it of the actuallinguistic expression of the ideological values that underlie it are far too broad to tackle ina single paper, even if this paper reports on research undertaken in the context of a verysmall, albeit vibrant, country, like Malta is. That is why our aim in this paper has beenrather modest. What we hope to have demonstrated through our argumentation andanalysis is that even a quick look at the most obvious textual characteristics of a carefullysampled body of discriminatory discourse can provide significant insight into the roots ofAuthenticated | stavros.assimakopoulos@um.edu.mt author's copyDownload Date | 3/3/18 1:38 AMLodz Papers in Pragmatics 13.2 (2017): 179–202 199Special issue on The pragmatics of othering: Stereotyping, hate speech and legitimising violenceDOI:10.1515/lpp-2017-0010the phenomenon of discrimination in society. Taking xenophobic and homophobicattitudes in Malta as a test case, we showed how the particular mechanisms of identityconstruction that underlie the social practice of discrimination in this context can beidentified through the textual analysis of discourse pertinent to the domains at hand. Andsince the aim is to approximate the values that trigger discrimination at a general level, thechoice and sampling of the relevant discourse on which textual analysis is to beperformed is pivotal. In this respect, we believe that publicly available online commentsto news portal stories are particularly useful in revealing the general public’s sentiment, asthey constitute instances of spontaneous, and often unfiltered, talk. All in all, since our –admittedly crude – textual analysis appears to largely corroborate the conclusionsindependently reached during our focus group interviews, we feel that this case study hassuccessfully shown that the tools available to linguists and discourse analysts alike canplay a crucial role in understanding and eventually countering discrimination. And giventhe increasing focus of policy, at least in the EU, on combatting hate speech, this is not atrivial conclusion.Obviously, there is a lot more to the textual analysis of discriminatory discourse thanour discussion here has managed to reveal. Once all the strategies used to express notonly a negative, but also a positive disposition towards the minorities under question arethoroughly examined, a far more nuanced picture of xenophobic and homophobicattitudes in the Maltese context will undoubtedly emerge. However, this would be a topicfor another paper, which we intend to pursue on another occasion in the not too distantfuture.AcknowledgementsThe research reported in this paper has been carried out as part of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T.project, which has received co-funding from the Rights, Equality & CitizenshipProgramme of the European Commission Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers(JUST/2014/RRAC/AG/HATE/6706).

    "abstract": "Reporting on research undertaken under the auspices of the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. project, the present paper investigates the roots of xenophobic and homophobic attitudes in Malta and the extent to which these can be pinpointed in the lexical choices made in discriminatory comments posted online in reaction to local news stories pertaining to migrants and members of the LGBTIQ community. Adopting Fairclough’s threedimensional framework (1995), we start off by presenting the values that underlie local discriminatory attitudes as social practice, as these were identified by the participants of four focus group interviews that were conducted at the University of Malta. In this respect, while xenophobia seems to be a far more pressing issue in Malta, homophobia, which is still also present, is taken to be predominantly triggered by deep-rooted religious beliefs and allegiance to heteronormative values. Then, when it comes to xenophobia, the main relevant trigger seems to be the perceived threat that the different collective background of a particular subset of migrants in Malta poses to the local culture. In an attempt to show that these values can also be discerned by examining even the most basic textual characteristics of a dataset comprising xenophobic and homophobic talk in the local context, we turn to identify them by looking at quantitative measures pertaining to lexical choice and metaphorical extension in the relevant parts of our corpus. In this way, we provide evidence for the fundamental – for Critical Discourse Analysis – claim that the textual analysis of a relevant dataset can indeed reveal the axiological framework that underlies the negative stance that the general population may have in relation to particular minorities, showcasing the relevance of discourse analytic methods for the broader understanding of discrimination and hate speech.Rights, Equality & Citizenship Programme of the European Commission Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (JUST/2014/RRAC/AG/HATE/6706)peer-reviewe",
