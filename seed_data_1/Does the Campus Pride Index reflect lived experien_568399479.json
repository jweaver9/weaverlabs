This study targets two of them, Student Life (SL) and Housing & Residence Life (HRL), and considers the experiences of LGBTQ students. The research infused minority stress theory throughout the interview protocol to determine how each area affects an LGBTQ student’s mental and physical health. The major findings of this study were that though a sense of belonging did exist, it was due to the relationships built amongst fellow LGBTQ students and not the institution itself. Furthermore, students felt CPI scores were misleading and that minority stress impacted student mental health in various ways. This research is relevant to college-seeking students, current enrollees, senior administrators, and Campus Pride. Implications of this study are far-reaching in that research data disputes published inclusivity scores in the CPI and demonstrate significant areas where this institution is failing its LGBTQ students.1  Section One – Introduction to the Dissertation-in-Practice  Background  The Campus Pride Index is an online catalog of institutions nationwide that measures campus inclusivity toward the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) population (Campus Pride, 2020). Given that college choice is important, especially for LGBTQ individuals (Red Ventures, 2021), the Index serves as an important assessment and campus climate tool for college choice and meeting personal needs (Casey, 2014; National Center for Education Statistics, 2012). Furthermore, given the minority status of the population, which is just over 5% of US citizens (Jones, 2021), it is essential to consider the implications of minority stress as it relates to the students' experiences. Minority stress theory describes the physical and psychological impacts of holding a minority identity (Meyer, 1995, 2003). The implications of such health hazards must be further analyzed, and the relationship to campus climate should be determined. This study considered the differences between the assigned CPI rating for the institution and the lived experiences of LGBTQ individuals at the institution in the areas of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life. The campus environment has the potential to significantly affect the physical and mental health of minority LGBTQ students in the form of policies, procedures, staffing, and overall climate. Statement of the Problem The problem studied was to learn how LGBTQ students describe their lived experiences in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life at the institution. Further, to explore if there were any differences between the received CPI rating and those lived experiences. For example, would a college or university with a 5-star rating, inferring high levels of inclusive policies, resources, and support, have LGBTQ students agreeing with the rating? Would these students 2  report that their collegiate experiences at the institution are deserving of a 5-star rating? Recent studies have called for the use of the CPI as a recruitment tool for LGBTQ students (Garvey et al., 2017); however, there has been no research on the accuracy of the CPI rating. While evidence of the importance of campus climate related to LGBTQ student transition and success in college is abundant (Blumenfeld, 2012; Bowling, Miller, & Mather, 2019), there is no such exploration of the effectiveness of the CPI, which is a tool measuring college campus’s inclusivity as it relates to LGBTQ matters. Further, Meyer (1995, 2003) explored the impact of minority status on mental health and found that negative experiences relating to their identity were predictors of psychological distress. This notion was expounded upon when Woodford, Kulick, Garvey, Sinco, and Hong (2018) examined the effects of structural heterosexism on LGBTQ individuals. They found that structural changes at institutions, such as increasing the LGBTQ faculty ratio and adding nondiscrimination policies impacted the experiences of LGBTQ individuals. These findings tie directly to the CPI as it considers LGBTQ scholarship and policy. The problem is that there is no true accuracy measurement of the CPI, nor how the elements that comprise the CPI reflect minority (LGBTQ) individuals' lived experiences. Purpose of the Study This study aimed to learn how LGBTQ students described their lived experiences in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life at the institution. Further, to explore if there were any differences in the assigned CPI rating for areas of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life and LGBTQ student lived experiences at a large, 4-year research university in the Midwest. Since the CPI serves as a potential data source for students in college choice for attendance (Garvey et al., 2017), it is crucial to determine its accuracy. For example, if the CPI gives an 3  institution a 5-star rating, would students share that they have had a 5-star experience during their time at the institution? This study aimed to explore that notion and further determine whether these experiences have had any kind of effect on participants’ mental and physical health. As such, minority stress theory was utilized as a theoretical framework for the study.  Due to the checklist and procedural nature of the questions the CPI utilizes to give the rating, it is suspected that LGBTQ individuals would disagree that their experience would match that of the CPI rating. In the CPI questionnaire, if the institution meets a certain number of criteria, they receive a corresponding rating. The existence of a policy or procedure does not necessarily imply that all LGBTQ individuals will be influenced by it the same. Given that the CPI is one of the few instruments to measure campus inclusivity towards LGBTQ students and has been suggested as a recruitment tool, it is vital to review differences in the CPI rating and lived experiences. Doing so provides the ability for LGBTQ students to be more informed in college choice and institutional leaders to have a better grasp of the effectiveness and accessibility of reported resources. The target audience for this study is LGBTQ students, institutional staff and senior leaders, and the non-profit Campus Pride. Research Questions This study determined how the lived experiences of LGBTQ students compare to the CPI rating received by an institution. Additionally, determination of the structural factors contributing to the rating were analyzed. All research was guided by tenets of Minority Stress Theory (MST) to determine how the CPI rating and structural factors may contribute to minority stress. The research questions to be answered were: 1. How do LGBTQ students at the institution describe their experiences in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life? 4  2. Are there differences in assigned CPI rating for the areas of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life and the reported experience of students at the institution? 3. Does minority stress impact LGBTQ students at the institution, particularly in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life? a) How can sense of belonging work to combat the effects of minority stress on LGBTQ students? Conceptual and Theoretical Frameworks MST guided the study, including questions asked in the interview and data analysis. This theory was chosen for this study because of its relevance to the population and how the campus climate can impact an LGBTQ individual. A basic tenet of MST is that people with minority identities endure higher mental health concerns than their majority peers (Meyer, 1995, 2003). In addition, other researchers have added to the body of scholarship on minority stress, such as Woodford et al. (2018), who explored structural heterosexism and its relevance to minority stress. There is also Silverschanz et al. (2008), who explained the incidence of heterosexism in academia. Heterosexism is the “systemic bias that favors heterosexuals and heterosexuality” and is the assumption that heterosexuality is the norm (Rainbow Resource Centre, 2012, pp. 1-2). They also summarized MST to “[assert] that socially marginalized groups, including sexual minorities, can experience mental and physical health problems resulting from negative social environments created by stigma, prejudice, and discrimination” (p. 180). Given that LGBTQ individuals comprise just over 5% of the United States population (Jones, 2021), it is plausible to utilize minority stress theory for this study. Other researchers have explored the impacts of minority stress on LGBTQ populations. Hatzenbuehler (2009) established a framework that suggested that LGBTQ minorities are at a 5  higher risk for psychological distress due to their stigmas and negative perceptions. Fulginiti et al. (2020) researched the relationship between suicide rates and minority stress. They found that minority stress was an indicator in models which predicted suicide. Prior research into minority stress and related health complications occurred in quantitative and qualitative studies (below). Given that there has not been a precedent in best practice for using MST in research, the guiding aspect that the theory had in this study was unique attention to detail as to how structural factors and lived experiences impact psychological and physical health. Also, many of the studies exploring minority stress used demographic data to narrow further the impacts of minority stress on subgroups (Meyer, 1995, explored effects on gay men; Polihronakis et al., 2021, examined impacts on bisexual populations; and Fulginiti et al., 2020, had a participant demographic including gay, bisexual, and pansexual individuals) within a given population. Each of these studies explores minority stress’s impact on different populations in the LGBTQ community. They do not focus specifically on the LGBTQ umbrella, and this study aims to do the same. There will be a discussion on how different findings impact different identities within the LGBTQ community. Design of the Study This study was a qualitative case study wherein semi-structured recorded interviews were used to gather data and later coded for major themes. Qualitative research means it is research that seeks to understand “how people interpret their experiences, how they construct their worlds, and what meaning they attribute to their experiences” (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 6). Further, qualitative research uses words as data instead of numbers, which are then dissected and analyzed. Studies utilizing MST often address their work through a quantitative approach (Meyer, 1995, 2003; Woodford et al., 2018). Those studies, however, measured instances of 6  events, policies, and so on. This study aims to consider the lived experiences and the factors that impact those experiences, so qualitative research is appropriate.  The research was conducted as a case study. Merriam and Tisdell (2016) describe a case study as an “intensive, holistic description and analysis of a single, bounded unit” (pp. 232-233). Further, they explain that data acquired in a case study are usually “derived from interviews, field observations, and documents (p. 233).” This study only focused on LGBTQ students at the institution. This research occurred within a single university setting, and all interviewed participants were affiliated with the institution. A bounded unit is created within these constraints and thus a case study. Using MST as an influence, qualitative data was gathered to determine the impact such stress had on psychological and physical health. Additionally, as is common in minority stress studies, demographic data were collected—specifically, sexual and gender identity, to determine how minority stress impacts subgroups of the LGBTQ population.  The CPI broadly measures policies and procedures at an institution, which we can describe as structural. The first two research questions were investigated from an MST lens, which then informed the final research question. The first research question was addressed by asking a series of questions targeting the components of the CPI relating to Student Life and Housing & Residence Life. From these answers, the second research question, which sought to understand how lived experiences relate to the rated CPI score of the institution, was revealed. Finally, specific questions were asked to understand better the impacts Student Life and Housing & Residence Life have on LGBTQ students.  Constructivist Paradigm Mertens (2020) describes the constructivist paradigm as a socially constructed reality, and there are multiple perspectives to a single event or story, and they each matter. The text also 7  brings into the discussion hermeneutics, or “interpret[ing] the meaning of something from a certain standpoint or situation” (p. 16). Furthermore, Mertens explains that “... knowledge is socially constructed by people active in the research process and that researchers should attempt to understand the complex world of lived experience from the point of view of those who live it” (p. 16). The constructivist approach rejects that there is a single truth instead of multiple truths and that the researcher should work to understand those different truths. Following the constructivist paradigm, the primary means of data collection are expected to be qualitative, such as interviews, document reviews, and observations. Such approaches align well with the current study as the semi-structured interview (SSIs) was the primary data collection method. Lastly, to ensure that proper constructivist methodologies are used, questions were built into the SSI to “provide information about the background of the participants and the contents for which they are being studied” (p. 20). Setting  The study occurred at a large, public, 4-year, research-intensive institution in the Midwest. It has over 30,000 students and participates in Division I athletics. The university has several policies and procedures that benefit the LGBTQ community. For example, individuals may change their preferred name in the university database, there are same-sex insurance benefits, and the housing department offers gender-neutral options. In addition, the LGBTQ center has several affiliated student and professional organizations which engage in frequent campus programming efforts. Participants Participants of this study were LGBTQ-identifying students at a large, 4-year public research university in the Midwest. There are more than 30,000 students at the institution, with 8  over 20,000 being undergraduate, 6,000 graduate, and 1,500 enrolled in professional programs. The institution is predominately White, with nearly 24,000 students identifying as White. Approximately 75% of students are in-state, and almost 90% are Pell-eligible. To preserve participant confidentiality and safety, all information was kept private, only accessible to the researcher and dissertation team. Such data would include name, gender, sexual orientation, age, major, class standing, employment status, and so on. Due to this study asking for personal stories, a reader may be able to identify the participant based on that information, so anonymity cannot be promised. To aid in confidentiality, each participant was assigned a pseudonym and numeric value, and only the primary investigator will have access to the decoded list. For this study, there was no target number of participants. Instead, the researcher engaged with and interviewed participants until data saturation occurred. Johnson and Christensen (2017) stated that it is best to gather data until saturation is reached in qualitative research. They also explained that it is important to keep the sample as small as possible to be still able to engage in “case-oriented analyses” (p. 276). It was anticipated that there would be low participation in the survey based on recent diversity, equity, and inclusion concerns at the selected institution.  Sampling Snowball (chain) sampling was the primary means of participant selection for this study. Mertens (2020) describes snowball sampling as identifying key informants in the community to pass along the study information and eventually recruit more into the study. For this research, several well-connected students served as key informants, as well as some staff. These individuals had access to other LGBTQ student organizations and personal connections. The only requirements were that they are a member of the LGBTQ community and are a student at the institution under study. Relating this sampling method to minority stress theory, Meyer 9  (1995) used snowball sampling (in addition to another method). Initial participant recruitment occurred via outreach to key informants, as previously mentioned via email. If there is no response after seven days, an additional email is sent as a follow-up. Using these initial contacts, other participants were then recruited through snowball sampling. There was compensation for participants. Those that completed the entire interview received a $20 Amazon gift card. This gift card was emailed to them by the primary investigator to create an electronic trail confirming item delivery. Delivery of the Amazon gift card occurred within two weeks of the interview ending. Data Collection Tools and Procedures Interviews were the primary source of data for this study. There was one interview conducted for each participant. It was anticipated that each interview would take at least 60 to 90 minutes, though additional time was given if participants had lengthy responses. Additionally, with open-ended questions, the participant had the freedom to speak for as long or little as they wished, which could impact the interview length. MST guided the primary development of the interview protocol while the published CPI data served as a basis for questioning. For example, asking participants if they agree or disagree with CPI data on the institution, as well as inquiring about structural factors and how they impacted the psychological and physical health of the individual. To further ensure that MST guided the interview protocol, Pachankis (2014) was utilized to infuse theory tenets throughout all questions. This was done through the use of principles such as: a) Normalize mental health consequences of minority stress, b) empower gay and bisexual men to communicate openly and assertively across contexts, c) validate gay and 10  bisexual men’s unique strengths, d) affirm healthy, rewarding expressions of sexuality, and e) facilitate supporting relationships (pp. 8-9). Throughout the interview protocol (Appendix B), these tenets of MST are infused into the questions. First, Pachankis (2014) explains that therapists should normalize the impacts of minority stress, making it standard practice that there may be adverse outcomes from a minority identity. Furthering into empowerment to communicate as minority stress acts to remove or silo communication, so strengthening means of communication is necessary. Then, Pachankis discusses validating unique strengths, such as perseverance in the face of stress and affirming and rewarding healthy expressions of sexuality. This means instead of condemning homosexual behavior; it is instead normalized. And lastly, the importance of facilitating supportive relationships. The study noted that participants found the LGBTQ community challenging to find a home in or get through superficial barriers (age, appearance, income). So, finding a supportive community was essential to navigating through this. These ideas were infused throughout the questions in the forms of normalizing mental health, empowering and validating, affirming sexuality, and facilitating relationships. This study's specific type of interview was the semi-structured interview, which entailed a series of closed- and open-ended questions. This allowed the opportunity for follow-up questions, such as asking why or how behind a comment (Adams, 2015). Adams furthers this conversation by explaining that SSIs are appropriate only if one of the following participant conditions are met: is a program recipient, interested party, or administration member. Therefore, all participants affiliated with the institution would fall into at least one of these categories, if not more than one. To determine if there were differences between the CPI rating and lived 11  experiences, participants were shown the score for both SL (5 out of 5) and HRL (4 out of 5), as well as the checklist of offerings that contributed to the overall rating. Data Analysis Interview notes and transcripts were later coded to find overlapping and major themes. The researcher also took notes on participants’ gestures, attitudes, and tones to supplement the themes yielded from the data. The data that explained the sample demographics were sexual orientation, gender identity, and class standing. The descriptive statistical information was helpful for a variety of reasons. They allowed the researcher to conclude different findings across subgroups of the sample, such as one sexual orientation versus another, as is common in other minority stress studies (see previous examples). Gathering descriptive data also allows the researcher to understand better the sample's membership and how the LGBTQ population engages (or does not) with the study. The coding occurred several times, with the first round of data coding after each interview. The researcher then reviewed and cleaned the data, ensuring time stamps were aligned appropriately and transcription was free of errors and typos. Next, the researcher analyzed transcripts of the interviews in addition to researcher notes and made comments on the common themes and patterns. To understand the overall climate, a final coding occurred on all data to create a master list of major themes and patterns. As is common in minority stress studies (see previous examples), subgroup (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual) coding occurred to explain how structural factors impact each group differently.                               Some quotes powerfully conveyed a point and were impactful enough to be made into themes. They were then prominently displayed in the research (Adams, 2015). The data was then analyzed, and the researcher commented on key findings or interesting notions and conclusions from each interview. Using these comments, themes and patterns became evident. This method 12  created a comprehensive set of themes for each group. Then, these themes were compared between the groups to determine if there was any overlap or overarching themes (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Themes and patterns were selected by their prevalence in the data or by a significant impact on the student. To ensure the researcher used appropriate language in interviews and that overall themes made sense for the topic, several individuals close to the subject matter were recruited to review the content and provide feedback. Quality of Research When considering a quantitative study, one may look for the internal and external validity of the research; however, qualitative data instead utilizes credibility (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Whereas validity looks to find a reality, credibility reinforces the existing data. In this study, a running log of notes from interviews was stored. Quick notes were taken with pen and paper and later typed into a digital archive. Interviews were conducted through the virtual meeting software Zoom, but audio transcription occurred through the Otter software. During the interview, information taken heavily relied on quotes from individuals. Furthermore, permission to record each interview was requested. Recording allowed the researcher to go back and review the data (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). As Adams (2015) discussed, it is essential in SSIs to have a contingency plan if participants do not wish to be recorded. Adams suggests utilizing a different form of note-taking, such as pen and paper, tablet, or computer.  To also aid in the credibility of the study, the researcher used triangulation, which Merriam & Tisdell (2016) describe as “using multiple sources of data means comparing and cross-checking data collected through observations at different times or in different places, or interview data collected from people with different perspectives or from follow-up interviews 13  with the same people” (p. 245). Since this study did not utilize observations, the primary points for triangulation were comparing interview data between different types of participants and sharing data with the identified experts in the field to determine if the results made sense. Triangulation was also done through respondent validation, or “solict[ing] feedback on … preliminary or emerging findings from some of the people that [the researcher] interviewed” (p. 246). Respondent validation allowed the researcher to rule out misinterpretation of data. To address the researcher’s reflexivity or the extent to which the researcher impacts the study, the researcher shared their own “biases, dispositions, and assumptions regarding the research to be undertaken” (p. 249). Similar to validity and credibility, qualitative research used consistency instead of reliability, which is what we expect in quantitative analysis (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Whereas in quantitative research, we would expect that the study would be able to be replicated elsewhere with similar results. Since replication is not always possible with qualitative research, the researcher worked to ensure that the results and processes were as consistent as possible. One way to do this was triangulation or an audit trail. The audit trail described, in rich detail, each step the researcher took throughout the study. Rich detail includes how the data was collected, which themes were formed (and why), and explaining what caused all decisions to be made. This was done by keeping a detailed log of notes, either physically or electronically, throughout the research and analytical processes. In quantitative research, external validity refers to the study’s ability to “be applied to other situations'' (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016, p. 253). For qualitative research, we are looking into the generalizability of the study since it is not always possible to apply someone’s lived experiences to another situation. However, there is the possibility some aspects of the study can 14  be recreated or generalized elsewhere. This can be done through thick description to increase the ability to transfer qualitative data, which means “...a highly descriptive, detailed presentation of the setting and in particular, the findings of the study” (p. 257). This can also be done by applying Patton’s Ethical Issues Checklist, as Merriam and Tisdell (2016) discussed. Limitations, Assumptions, and Design Controls  This study had anticipated limitations regarding the implications of COVID-19 on networking and social gatherings and the timeliness of CPI publications and updates. It was important to note that this study occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. As policies and protocols evolved, so did the opportunities to engage with the institution and other LGBTQ individuals. An individual may report a lack of belonging, but it would be difficult to determine whether this was tied to their LGBTQ identity or if it is a result of the pandemic. Additionally, the institution has scaled back on varying levels of social engagement and, in some instances, support mechanisms due to the pandemic. Furthermore, the CPI date used for this study is from before the pandemic, which leads to the following limitation, the timeliness of CPI updates.   Since campus authorities update the CPI, the data available on the site may become outdated. In other words, unless a campus authority completes the CPI questionnaire, the ranking on the site will not change. As institutions constantly change, it would be beneficial to update the CPI rating frequently. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a lot of changes in institutions. Still, if the CPI questionnaire were not completed during or after the brunt of the pandemic, then those differences would not be reflected in the rating. This study will occur in the spring of 2022, many months after the pandemic began. At the time of writing, the last update for the institution is from 2020. There are also some assumptions being made in this study. 15   Given the marginalized population this study worked with, the selection and engagement of participants in interviews were anticipated to be challenging. This study relied on key community stakeholders to identify participants, and the participant pool was only as strong as the stakeholder.   This study also assumed that, to some degree, lived experiences impact physical and mental health. Whether this impact was positive or negative within the contexts of the CPI and the institution was determined through the use of MST.  There were several design controls within the study. The researcher controlled the time, space/location, data collection and analysis method, participant selection, and interview protocol. The study occurred throughout late spring 2022, with data analysis occurring early summer 2022. All participants and CPI data were from the same institution. Interviews occurred through a controlled environment contained within the Zoom software. In this study, the researcher controlled data access, storage, and destruction of said data. This protocol also determined who was eligible to participate in the study. Definition of Key Terms To better understand LGBTQ identity, we must first address the history of the LGBTQ identity and related terminology. This is particularly important as terminology and language are important in storytelling and experience sharing. The following terms are those that participants may share in their interviews. In addition, the Human Rights Campaign has compiled a list of common terminology related to the LGBTQ community. Per their website (n.d.), LGBTQ stands for: a) Lesbian, A woman who is emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to other women. Women and non-binary people may use this term to describe themselves; b) 16  Gay, A person who is emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to members of the same gender. Men, women and non-binary people may use this term to describe themselves; c) Bisexual, A person emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to more than one sex, gender or gender identity though not necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree. Sometimes used interchangeably with pansexual; d) Transgender, An umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from cultural expectations based on the sex they were assigned at birth. Being transgender does not imply any specific sexual orientation. Therefore, transgender people may identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc.; e) Queer, A term used to describe people who are in the process of exploring their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some additional terminology related to the LGBTQ community, again from the Human Rights Campaign (n.d.), which were embedded in the definitions above, include: a) Pansexual, Describes someone who has the potential for emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to people of any gender though not necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree. Sometimes used interchangeably with bisexual; b) Gender identity - One’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth; c) Sexual Orientation - An inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people; d) Non-binary, An adjective describing a person who does not identify exclusively as a man or a woman. Non-binary people may identify as being both a man and a woman, somewhere in between, or as falling completely outside these categories. While many also identify as transgender, not all non-binary people do. 17  With a basic understanding of the varying terminology of the LGBTQ community, the history and context relating to the marginalization, isolation, and hostility the community has and continues to face will make more sense. Significance of the Study This study is significant because the CPI may serve as a data source for college choice for LGBTQ students (Garvey et al., 2017). Additionally, an exploration of the lived experiences, particularly those related to Student Life and Housing & Residence Life, and how they impact psychological and physical health per minority stress needs to be completed. As noted previously, several researchers have explored different factors relating to minority stress and the negative implications on health due to such stress. The results of this study should be significant to institutions with similar demographics, such as size, geographic location, and political leanings. For institutions that do not find similarities in findings, such as liberal arts colleges, or smaller, public institutions, there may be key areas that are applicable. If not, these are potential areas of future research. The study has the potential to indicate that the CPI rating does not have a direct relationship to LGBTQ students’ lived experiences.  The potential implications of this study are that the CPI may need to consider revamping the questionnaire it currently utilizes. The exact revision would depend on the findings. Second, the institution may need to review its current policies, procedures, and practices. Third, using the factors participants share in the interviews will shed light on what the institution can do differently to work towards lived experiences corresponding positively with the CPI rating. Finally, results may demonstrate a direct relationship between the lived experiences and CPI rating at the institution and that there is no work to be done. Instead, other institutions can compare their metrics and practices to see where they stand. Additionally, findings will indicate 18  to what extent minority stress theory applies to these individuals. For example, an institution with perhaps a 5-star rating may have lower levels of stress amongst its minority LGBTQ individuals as compared to a 2-star rating, and so on. Summary This study aimed to determine whether there were differences between the institutional CPI rating (Appendix A) an institution receives and the lived experiences of LGBTQ students at a large, 4-year public research university in the Midwest. This determination of differences in the CPI rating to lived experiences is crucial in aiding future LGBTQ individuals in college choice. The study was conducted from a case study approach and followed a constructivist paradigm with MST guiding the study (see Appendix B). Data collection occurred primarily through recorded and transcribed semi-structured interviews with participants, which were later coded for themes and patterns. Participants were identified through snowball sampling. Implications for this study vary from the potential need for Campus Pride to review its questionnaire to institutional changes to policies, procedures, and practices. This study also allowed future research at different types of institutions. It is important to review the research setting to understand the study better. Therefore, the following section discusses the research setting, including general institution type, size, history, and a breakdown of target areas from the CPI at that institution. There is also a discussion of organizational analysis, leadership styles, and a recent history of leadership at the institution.  19  Section Two – Practitioner Setting for the Study  The institution is over 150 years old and one of the country's oldest. It holds several accolades regarding its research, academics, and athletics. Students come to the institution from across the globe for its undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. Among other accomplishments, the institution also boasts world-class healthcare for the local community, state, and nation. The institution is a large, public, 4-year research institution in the Midwest. It has over 30,000 students and participates in Division I athletics.  History of the Organization Institutional History All citations for the history of the organization were omitted to conserve anonymity. The institution was founded through turmoil as several counties were bidding for the rights to have the institution on their land. After a joint effort between city and county, the institution became the first in its state. Shortly after its establishment, the institution ceased to function due to the Civil War and the temporary use of its facilities to aid in wartime needs. Later in the 1800s, the first women were admitted, and the institution expanded its scope to include agriculture education and other professional programs.   Before the Civil Rights Act of 1964, this institution admitted Black students to its academic programs, though not without court intervention. This applied to both the professional and undergraduate programs. The institution saw its fair share of student activism as well. During the Vietnam War, student protests sparked the brief shutdown of campus. The university has several policies and procedures that benefit the LGBTQ community. For example, individuals may change their preferred name in the university database, there are same-sex insurance benefits, and the housing department offers gender-neutral options. In 20  addition, the LGBTQ center has several affiliated student and professional organizations that engage in frequent campus programming efforts.   Just as there are positive outlooks for LGBTQ individuals at the institution, there are also varying levels of negative influences. For example, within the last year, the LGBTQ center on campus has seen its full-time staff laid off due to restructuring. Though the restructuring aims to provide better long-term support, LGBTQ individuals have shared that the removal of staff has also impacted them negatively because of the relationships built with the staff member.   This study aimed to understand better how the campus climate relates to the Campus Pride Index and how the current campus climate affects the lived experiences of LGBTQ individuals at the institution. This occurred through an analysis of institutional structures and determination of how these variables impacted the physical and mental health of LGBTQ individuals. Throughout this process, MST was used to guide research and analysis. Institutional Support Systems  To further understand the varying structures of support that exist at the institution, the Campus Pride Index’s online campus climate inclusivity tool will be utilized (Campus Pride, 2020). For clarity, a campus authority completes the questionnaire, and the results are published online (if the institution chooses to do so). The eight categories below are metrics used by the instrument to determine an institution's level of LGBTQ campus inclusivity. It is important to clarify that the below campus climate information is only as good as the information was available to the campus authority completing the questionnaire and whether details and information have changed since last submitted to Campus Pride in 2020. For this discussion, all eight CPI categories are discussed briefly to give context as to their current standings at the 21  institution. This study does not focus on all eight; only the categories of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life are under study and will be discussed in more detail later. Policy Inclusion. When considering LGBTQ policy inclusion at the institution, we are determining whether there are policies that are inclusive of LGBTQ identities. For example, there are non-discrimination policies for sexual orientation and gender identity/expression at the institution. Furthermore, there are employment benefits for same-sex partners and the opportunity for students to go by a name other than their birth name. Some areas where there are improvements for LGBTQ policy are the option for students to change gender identity on university records and to offer the opportunity for students to self-identify sexual orientation and gender identity or expression on enrollment forms. Support and Commitment. The institution does relatively well creating opportunities to support LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff. There is an LGBTQ center, which has staff dedicated to supporting services, and offers a safe space/ally training program for the institution community. The institution also employs LGBTQ individuals, which are visible to the community. Lastly, an active LGBTQ alumni organization and an institutional committee are dedicated to handling LGBTQ issues and concerns. Academics. Though the institution excels broadly in academics and research, there are areas for improvement regarding LGBTQ scholarship. First, the institution does not have a dedicated LGBTQ degree. There are no training opportunities for faculty and staff, such as through onboarding, for sexual orientation and gender identity issues. However, there are some areas in which the institution does make a reasonable effort in LGBTQ scholarship. For example, though there is no dedicated LGBTQ degree, there are LGBTQ-specific courses. There are also 22  faculty who are recruited for LGBTQ scholarships. Lastly, there is an LGBTQ faculty and staff organization within the institution. Student Life. There are several areas in which the institution exceeds in LGBTQ student life. There are LGBTQ organizations for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The institution also has a recognized LGBTQ Greek organization. The institution also offers LGBTQ social engagement opportunities and educational events on transgender issues and the intersectionality of identities for LGBTQ individuals. There are also LGBTQ career services available to students as well. Student Housing. The institution’s housing department is responsible for housing thousands of students. It offers LGBTQ living spaces and gender-inclusive housing for new and returning students. The housing department also trains housing staff on LGBTQ issues and concerns. Areas of improvement for the housing department would be to create gender-inclusive or single-occupancy restroom facilities throughout campus housing. Additionally, the option for roommate matching is added for LGBTQ students to find allies in housing. Campus Safety. LGBTQ campus safety is important at the institution. There are procedures for reporting LGBTQ-related hate crimes or bias incidents. The institution also offers hate crime prevention training, including educating campus police on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression issues. The institution and campus police also support survivors of LGBTQ partners and sexual violence. Through partnerships, there is hate crime prevention training and out to LGBTQ students and organizations.  Counseling and Health. The institution excels in offering inclusive support for LGBTQ individuals. Health insurance covers ongoing counseling services and hormone replacement therapy with trans-inclusive policies. Safe sex materials and LGBTQ-specific information are 23  available to students, faculty, and staff. The institution offers free HIV and STI testing. The counseling staff is trans-inclusive and has LGBTQ counseling and support groups. Recruitment and Retention. There are several initiatives the institution takes to make recruitment and retention more LGBTQ-inclusive. For example, the institution participates in admission fairs specific to LGBTQ individuals. Furthermore, there are scholarships available to LGBTQ students and a mentorship program to assist in acclimation to college. In addition, admission representatives receive LGBTQ training. Lastly, the institution offers special graduation for LGBTQ students and allies, known as Rainbow or Lavender graduation. Descriptions of these varying levels of current campus climate aim to shed light on the setting for the experiences of LGBTQ students. Most of the items discussed above lead to what should be a positive experience for such individuals. However, it is currently unclear if such a climate leads to a positive lived experience for LGBTQ students. Further Discussion of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life  Student Life. Unsurprisingly, this institution considers Housing & Residence Life part of Student Life. On the Student Life landing page of the site, there are several subcategories, one of which is “housing.” Since this will be discussed in more detail, there will be no discussion here of Housing & Residence Life as part of Student Life. The institution offers more than 600 clubs and organizations for students to get involved with peers. They range from academic ties (think biology club) to sports; others are identity-based (race, religion, sexual and gender identities, and so on). The institution also hires staff to be knowledge experts on these organizations so that students can share interests and be connected with one that meets their needs. Under the Student Life umbrella is Greek life. 24   The institution is home to more than 50 recognized fraternities and sororities, creating a Greek student population of more than 25% of the student body, or 7,500 students. Within these numbers are Greek organizations that support identity as well. There are also student-led advocacy organizations tied to Greek life which support LGBTQ students and their allies.  A newer version of involvement at the institution comes in the form of an engagement transcript. The institution has partnered with a software company to create an engagement transcript for students to showcase the different things they did while they were a student. It tracks attendance at events and organizations they join, and if they are a housing student, some of the initiatives hosted there are also included. It provides students an opportunity to have more than an academic transcript at graduation.  The Student Life “office” at the institution covers many units. As mentioned, Greek life is here, as well as general student involvement (clubs) and leadership initiatives. Across all of these units are many full-time and student staff. Directors of these units report to an associate director of student affairs and a vice chancellor of student affairs.   Housing & Residence Life. The housing department at the institution is home to nearly 7,000 students. These students range from undergraduates to upperclassmen and even graduate and professional students. Housing options include traditional co-ed spaces, suite-style, and apartments. Across these many communities are more than 15 professional staff members who live in the hall and more than 200 student staff of Resident Advisors (RAs). These RAs are responsible for in-hall programming, which focuses on various topics, such as social, educational, service, and diversity. In addition, RAs and professional staff serve in an emergency on-call after-hours rotation where they support students’ needs in various ways. This can be facilities, police involvement, or mental health crises.  25   Above the live-in professional staff are a group of assistant directors who oversee geographic areas of campus, and above them is an associate director who oversees the residential education portion of the housing department. The department director reports to the vice president for student affairs (this is why Housing & Residence Life falls under the Student Life umbrella).   There is also a student-led governing body of the dorms. They serve as a voice of concern and advocacy for the residential student body. This comes from policy revisions or implementation, programmatic opportunities, and purchasing major items for experiential improvement. This department also implemented subunits of this governing body in each dorm, serving the same purpose as the larger body.  The department extensively trains student and professional staff on LGBTQ-related issues, including best practices. These trainings come from internal sources, the LGBTQ resource office, and the counseling center. Among these trainings are explicit requirements for reporting incidents of bias or harassment, including those related to LGBTQ identities. Organizational Analysis  Given the institution is in the public domain and relies heavily on state funding, it is at the mercy of the government to balance and maintain budgets. This means that the institution generally has to act within the scope of the state government and its political leanings to ensure funding year to year. Additionally, the institution operates in a rather bureaucratic manner. There is a clear hierarchy, which is expected to be followed in most instances.  Political Framework  Using Bolman and Deal (2017), we can dissect the organization better to understand institutional actions, policies, and procedures. The political framework “proposes that 26  interdependence, divergent interests, scarcity, and power relations inevitably spawn political activity” (p. 183). Resources are limited within the institution, yet many competing needs exist. The use of space is an appropriate example. What is the best way to effectively use and manage space at the institution? How is that cost determined? These questions must be answered when the institution shifts its space utilization model. Or, when considering the financial implications of going against the wishes of politicians in the state, how is the fiscal budget impacted? The determination of whether the institution can have messaging to support certain national events and its students must be weighed and worded carefully to meet the intended purpose and not upset those with financial power.  Another critical piece of the political framework is that it “emphasizes that goals are not set by edict at the top but evolve through an ongoing process of negotiation of bargaining” (Bolman & Deal, 2017, p. 186). This stems from the need to determine the best resource allocation, which is sometimes done through negotiations. Further, it may be done through different sources of power. For example, the power of position authority, or someone of high authority, has made a decision, and those below them must make it happen. The institution recently saw this at play when senior leadership shared that other institution members needed to support decisions made by senior leadership. Otherwise, they should consider leaving the institution. It can also be done through alliances and networks. In an institutional setting where there may be factors working against an initiative, it is far easier to make progress when there are friends and allies across the system. The institution saw this as well, but in a positive light as it supported students. Different departments can come together to support students from different angles and steps in their collegiate journey. Lastly, it is easy to control the decision-making process with the access and control of agendas. Decisions being made higher up the hierarchy 27  may not include the voices or opinions of those below them as they do not have access to the agenda or decision-making power. This is seen when a decision is made without input from others, and concerns are raised about potential unforeseen impacts. Structural Framework The structural frame is “the oldest and most popular [way] of thinking about organization[s]” (Bolman & Deal, 2017, p. 43). It delves into the hierarchy of an organization, reporting structures, and the general bureaucracy. The structural frame is apt to further analyze the institution due to the complex organizational structures. Aside from the traditional organization chart to explain different roles and reporting systems, there also exists the ability to dissect working duties. Discussed earlier was a restructure that impacted IDE offices and their staffing. Bolman and Deal (2017) explained that “the more complex a role structure (lots of people doing many different things), the harder it is to sustain a focused, tightly coupled enterprise” (p. 73). The proposed new structure combines the roles of previously held people into one position. Using the logic put forth by Bolman and Deal, it is easy to question the effectiveness of this restructure given the additional roles the new individuals will have. Also discussed is the pitfall of gaps and overlaps in job roles. For example, what happens when we consider an individual with intersecting identities? “If key responsibilities are not assigned, important tasks fall through the cracks. Conversely, roles and activities can overlap, creating conflict, wasted effort, and unintended redundancy” (p. 73). Restructuring is not always bad and can often lead to sound organizational change. Bolman and Deal (2017) discussed several steps that should be followed to impart a successful structural change to an organization. For example, the existing structure and processes 28  should be analyzed to understand what worked and what did not. The change initiator should also develop new goals that align with the organization's current needs. They should “design [a] new structure in response to changes in strategy, technology, and environment” (p. 92). Finally, as the restructuring process begins, it is always important to do status updates. What is working? What should we stop doing and start enacting? It is currently unclear whether these steps were considered when the restructuring occurred. This can be attributed to the natural hierarchy and flow of information, or perhaps it can be linked back to the political framework. Were staff (and students) of different levels invited to participate in the decision-making process? Though these pieces remain unclear, the restructuring process may have a significant positive impact on the IDE experience for students, faculty, and staff. Leadership Analysis  Leadership at the institution comes in many forms. Different aspects of the institution are led in various ways depending on who leads the respective unit. For example, there are very task-oriented leaders seeking to complete the goal at hand; in other areas, there are exceedingly compassionate ones focused on the individual and their wellbeing. Given an institution as large as this one, it is no surprise that there are many different leadership styles at many levels throughout the organization. Though there are different leadership styles throughout the organization, they work together harmoniously to move the institution forward. For this analysis, key individuals at the institution (such as vice chancellors for various areas) had their leadership styles considered, resulting in the following discussion. These individuals are those that can impact the lived experiences of students.   29  Authentic Leadership  The institutional leader (senior administrator below the chancellor) that was described as being exceedingly compassionate may also be called an authentic leader. Northouse (2019) describes authentic leadership as an “interpersonal process,” one that is “created by leaders and followers together” (p. 198). An authentic leader is someone that has a sense of purpose, knows what the right thing to do is, is relationship-driven, has self-discipline, and “[is] sensitive and empathetic to the plight of others” (p. 199). A leader following this approach positively engages their constituents and does everything in their power to see them succeed. Staff are motivated to work and do their best due to their relationship with this leader.   Authentic leadership is seen across many areas of the institution. For example, revisiting the IDE restructure, individuals' concern was that the staff lost due to reorganization served in more capacities than their primary role. They were support systems, friends, and allies to marginalized populations. A confidant whom someone could confide and build community with. These individuals (the IDE staff) created such an environment by leading with authentic leadership. Achievement-Oriented Leadership  A leader engaging in the achievement-oriented approach is one who “challenges followers to perform work at the highest level possible” (Northouse, 2019, p. 120). This leadership style serves as both a positive and a negative. If this challenge and support are done with high backing while challenging, there is potential for a positive outcome and environment. On the contrary, high expectations with low support may result in a negative environment due to the importance set upon unachievable goals. 30   This leadership style is seen at the institution as well. Some areas with leaders operating in this style are successful with great work environments. Others with the same leadership style have high levels of turnover due to the induced stress from high expectations and little support. An example of this is seen in the institution's operational and facilities management aspect. One area consistently yields excellent, positive results from its staff. Though the staff has high expectations, they also receive immense support. This is seen in senior academic affairs staff. There is unwavering devotion to results and supporting students. Still, tremendous support is also given to the staff to make sure staff have the resources needed to succeed in meeting these goals. Successful Leadership  According to Drucker (2004), an effective leader is one that “takes responsibility for decisions” as well as “focus[es] on opportunities, not problems” (p. 25). It is crucial to create an environment where taking risks and finding opportunities for action can significantly impact an organization’s success. Consistent focus on problems leads to a breakdown of team morale and undue stress. Furthermore, ownership of good and bad decisions is important to overall belief in a leader. A team that does not believe in their leader due to failure to take ownership of their actions may falter in their dedication to their position. We saw this in a 2015 leadership cohort with a consistent failure of ownership of decisions. Eventually, many institutional constituents demanded the removal of those leaders. If these leaders had listened to their constituents and acted accordingly, the outcome of their removal could have potentially been avoided. Though this was a negative outcome, it ushered in the opportunity for new leadership to emerge and lead the institution in a new direction.  Furthering the idea of engaging constituents, Davis (2003) stated that “leaders have ‘visions and dreams’ that become ‘the force that invents the future.’ They are ‘confident in their 31  ability to make extraordinary things happen’’’ (p. 5). A leader that does not falter in their ambition and direction of an organization, or its constituents, has a better chance of success than one that does not. The driving force behind an organization is its leader, so one that is a visionary and can be a positive influence will benefit it tremendously. We see this ideation in new leadership at the institution. When they arrived, they made it their mission to engage and learn from every staff member under their purview. Goals and action items were created with the information gleaned from these interactions. On the contrary, a leader that does not engage in this mindset may create a stagnant organization. An institution or organization without ambition and drive is only existing. There is no advancement in these situations, nor are staff truly satiated in their experiences.  Implications for Research in the Practitioner Setting  This study has the potential for significant implications in higher education settings. As discussed earlier, there is a gap in literature and practice as to how lived experiences of LGBTQ students compare to the institutional Campus Pride Index rating. Furthermore, there is also no evidence of how minority stress theory applies to these same individuals. We know that people with minority identities endure higher mental and physical health concerns, but how do institutional structures and policies, as well as the CPI rating, impact them?   Implications of this study may yield results that well-intended policies and procedures are not having the desired impact on LGBTQ individuals. Or, the study may reinforce that the institution is performing very well through its structures and policies to support its LGBTQ students. When considering the Campus Pride Index, it will be intriguing to learn how the institutional score compares to lived experiences. Depending on the outcome of this study, institutions may need to reconsider using the CPI to showcase their efforts. Comparatively, 32  LGBTQ individuals may also need to look elsewhere for their college choices. Another significant implication for this research is its applicability to other marginalized identities.   Though the LGBTQ population endures various hardships and experiences related to their identity, they do not mimic those of all marginalized identities. Similar to general research, inferences can be made about minority stress and lived experiences regardless of the identity so long as it is marginalized. This also creates an opportunity for future research areas using this study's results as a foundation.   One additional implication of this study is a revision of current practices. It is unclear what those practices are until the study occurs. When interviewing participants, they may share negative experiences which would benefit from change. Those experiences may range from employment to academics to various organizations.  Summary This study aims to determine differences in the institutional CPI rating an institution receives and the lived experiences of LGBTQ students at a large, 4-year public research university in the Midwest. Determining whether there are differences in the CPI rating and lived experiences is crucial in aiding future LGBTQ individuals in college choice. The study will be conducted from a comparative case study approach and follow a constructivist paradigm with minority stress theory guiding the study. Data collection will occur primarily through recorded and transcribed semi-structured interviews with participants, which will later be coded for themes and patterns. Participants will be identified through snowball sampling. Implications for this study vary from the potential need for Campus Pride to review its questionnaire to institutional changes to policies, procedures, and practices. This study also generates the opportunity for future research at different institutions. 33  To fully grasp the need for this study and the context of the setting, we must also understand the literature on the subject thus far. Therefore, the following literature review begins with a brief background of the CPI, followed by a discussion of relevant terminology, and dives into the history of the LGBTQ community. Next, there is a discussion of MST, and then the section concludes with a review of Campus Pride, the CPI, and implications for the research.  34  Section Three – Scholarly Review for the Study To initially explore the accuracy of the Campus Pride Index and its structural ties to MST, first, it was necessary to examine the literature on MST’s applicability to the LGBTQ community, Campus Climate, the Campus Pride Index, Student Life, and Housing & Residence Life.  To fully explore the accuracy of the Campus Pride Index and its structural ties to MST, it was also necessary to examine the research on institutional and sociopolitical practices related to the lived experiences of LGBTQ individuals. As a result, two bodies of literature emerged from the research: campus climate and the history of the Campus Pride Index itself.   Background          The Campus Pride Index is an online catalog of institutions nationwide that measures campus inclusivity toward the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) population (Campus Pride, 2020). Given that college choice is important, especially for LGBTQ individuals (Red Ventures, 2021), the Index serves as an important assessment and campus climate tool for college choice and meeting personal needs (Casey, 2014; National Center for Education Statistics, 2012). Furthermore, given the minority status of the population, which is just over 5% of US citizens (Jones, 2021) and 17% of college students nationwide (Postsecondary National Policy Institute, 2021), it is essential to consider the implications of minority stress as it relates to the experiences of the students. Minority stress theory describes the physical and psychological impacts of holding a minority identity (Meyer, 1995, 2003). Therefore, the implications of such health hazards must be further analyzed, and the relationship to campus climate should be determined. 35  This study determined whether there were differences between the assigned CPI rating of an institution and the lived experiences of LGBTQ students in the areas of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life. In addition, tenets of MST guided all research to determine how lived experiences and policies or procedures at the institution may contribute to minority stress. The research questions to be answered are: 1.  How do LGBTQ students at the institution describe their experiences in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life? 2. Are there differences in assigned CPI rating for the areas of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life and the reported experience of students at the institution? 3. Does minority stress impact LGBTQ students at the institution, particularly in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life? a) How can sense of belonging work to combat the effects of minority stress on LGBTQ students? As such, this literature review will address the following: 1. Minority stress theory, 2. Sense of belonging, 3. Campus climate, 4. Student Life, 5. Housing & Residence Life, 6. The CPI, its function, its catalog material, and a site overview The first portion of this literature review will discuss the topic's significance, followed by an exploration of literature relating to campus climate. Following this, there will be a discussion of 36  LGBTQ identities and history, the Campus Pride Index, Student Life and Housing & Residence Life, and Minority Stress Theory. Research on LGBTQ Identities Terminology  To better understand LGBTQ identity and use a common language, we must first address the history of the LGBTQ identity and related terminology. Knowing the terminology, a student may use in interviews to describe themselves, or their experiences are helpful. In addition, the Human Rights Campaign has compiled a list of standard language related to the LGBTQ community. Per their website (n.d.), LGBTQ stands for: a) Lesbian, A woman who is emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to other women. Women and non-binary people may use this term to describe themselves; b) Gay, A person who is emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to members of the same gender. Men, women and non-binary people may use this term to describe themselves; c) Bisexual, A person emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to more than one sex, gender or gender identity though not necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree. Sometimes used interchangeably with pansexual; d) Transgender, An umbrella term for people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from cultural expectations based on the sex they were assigned at birth. Being transgender does not imply any specific sexual orientation. Therefore, transgender people may identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc.; e) Queer, A term used to describe people who are in the process of exploring their sexual orientation or gender identity. Some additional terminology related to the LGBTQ community, again from the Human Rights Campaign (n.d.), which were embedded in the definitions above, include: 37  a) Pansexual, Describes someone who has the potential for emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to people of any gender though not necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree. Sometimes used interchangeably with bisexual; b) Gender identity - One’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither – how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth; c) Sexual Orientation - An inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people; d) Non-binary, An adjective describing a person who does not identify exclusively as a man or a woman. Non-binary people may identify as being both a man and a woman, somewhere in between, or as falling completely outside these categories. While many also identify as transgender, not all non-binary people do. With a basic understanding of the varying terminology of the LGBTQ community, the history and context relating to the marginalization, isolation, and hostility the community has faced and continues to face will make more sense. LGBTQ History  The Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) is a leader in LGBTQ advocacy, particularly for youth (GLSEN, 2021). To aid in its effort to educate on the LGBTQ community’s past and present, GLSEN (2016) has developed a comprehensive timeline outlining critical historical events that have impacted the LGBTQ community (both positively and negatively).   1950 was the setting of critical steps in LGBTQ student activism. The Mattachine Society began in Los Angeles in 1950 as a secret organization rooted in LGBTQ activism (Library of Congress, 2022). A premise of this organization was that the members did not know the names 38  of others. Fast forward to 1965 at Columbia University, where student Robert Martin began a local branch of the Mattachine Society (Burroway, 2018). This is one of the first LGBTQ student organizations on college campuses. The university, however, would not formally recognize the organization as it followed the standard practice of the Mattachine Society, where member names were hidden to keep members anonymous. In 1962, the United States saw the first decriminalization of sodomy since its original illegal roots in 1779 (GLSEN, 2016). One of the most iconic and impactful activism movements in LGBTQ history occurred in 1969 in New York during the Stonewall Inn Riots. Evelynn Hammonds, faculty at Harvard University, shared with The Harvard Gazette that “‘[t]he marches were among the first highly visible public events for people to express their gay sexuality and for allies to have an opportunity to support the gay people in their lives”’ (Walsh, 2019). Before 1973, physicians could medically diagnose homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder (Drescher, 2015). Though removing homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder was an improvement, it would be over a decade before different variations of homosexual cognitive disfunction were removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Furthermore, removal from the DSM did not mean the community and culture were accepted by society.  1971 was a big year for LGBTQ students on college campuses. The University of Michigan was the first institution to have an LGBTQ center on its campus, though this was not without its obstacles to founding (Jourian, 2021). Also, in 1971 was a five-day sit-in on the New York University campus inside one of its residence halls. This protest was in honor of the LGBTQ community and had ties to the Stonewall Riots a few years prior. In 1982 the United States saw the beginning of the AIDs epidemic, which was initially called GRID, or Gay-Related Immunodeficiency Disorder (Altman, 1982). The title of the news 39  article was New Homosexual Disorder Worries Health Officials. The report describes other populations impacted by the disease, but it was still tied to a minority population. More than a decade later, in 1998, the country saw an escalation in the demonization of LGBTQ people with the murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay Wyoming college student. He was brutally beaten, tied to a fence, and died of his injuries (Davis, 2012). Shepard’s murder was one of the most nationally recognized hate crimes targeting LGBTQ individuals, which later prompted the federal government to pass the “Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a federal law against bias-motivated crimes targeting LGBT people, among others” (para. 1). The passage of such a law did not mean that LGBTQ individuals had equal rights compared to their heterosexual counterparts. In 2003, the United States Supreme Court overturned sodomy laws and decriminalized homosexual behavior nationwide (Gilkis, 2018). The astonishing piece about this date is that it is less than 20 years ago at the time of writing. Later in 2015, the Supreme Court again issued comprehensive guidance for legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states. Though these advancements for the LGBTQ community are significant and welcomed, there is much work to be done, especially on university and college campuses, where campus climate and institutional structures impact students differently. Recently, there have been developments in the K12 public sector of education. Though not directly related to college campuses, students who funnel from K12 into campuses bring with them (or lack thereof) the basic knowledge and understanding they learn from the K12 environment. The governor of the state of Florida noted that he would be inclined to sign legislation making it illegal for public K12 schools to teach or discuss gender identity and sexual orientation in the classroom (Sopelsa, Bellamy-Walker, & Reuters, 2022).  40  Minority Stress Theory  Meyer (1995) describes minority stress as a psychological detriment caused by the impact a minority identity has on the individual. He further explained that it is stress related to societal stigmatization, homophobia, and incidents of violence and discrimination. Brooks (1981) furthers the notion that societal norms and perceptions can significantly impact a minority individual through the internalization of such content into one’s psyche. When considering the LGBTQ community, Polihronakis et al. (2021) posit that “health disparities of sexual minority people can be partly attributed to heterosexism, which perpetuated interpersonal and institutional discrimination against individuals who do not adhere to society’s rigid standards of exclusively heterosexual attraction, behavior, and/or identity” (p. 202). Their study found that minority stress causes adverse effects on LGBTQ individuals (specifically bisexual men), such as sexual health concerns and substance use.   Contributing factors to minority stress are both distal and proximal stressors (Hatzenbuehler, 2009). A distal stressor is motivated by prejudice or discrimination. Contrary to distal stressors, we would expect to see proximal stressors in the forms of identity acceptance (or rejection). In addition to the discussion on stressors, Hatzenbuehler proposed a synthesis of three major themes in literature (“psychiatric epidemiology, group-specific social stressors resulting from stigma, and general psychological processes”), which was termed the psychological mediation framework (p. 8). The framework suggests that sexual minorities enduring stigma-related stress are “more vulnerable to general psychological processes that are known to predict psychopathology in heterosexuals” (p. 8). Due to the framework’s synthesis of existing literature, each component within the framework builds upon itself. For example, “[the framework] argues 41  that one risk factor is a consequence of the other and that both contribute to the pathogenesis of mental disorders in LGB[TQ] populations. Additionally, this [approach] takes into account the unique stressors that sexual minorities confront” (p. 8). In combination with Meyer's (2003), Hatzenbuehler's work was critical in establishing a working theoretical approach to understanding the impact of minority stress on sexual minority populations. Following Hatzenbuehler (2009), other scholars have researched the relationship between minority stress and various mental health concerns within the LGBTQ population, including suicide.  Meyer (1995, 2003) and Hatzenbuehler (2009) explored the interconnections of minority status with mental health. Fulginiti et al. (2020) further examined the impact minority status has on suicide. They found that “[s]exual minority stress [was associated] with both perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness in models predicting suicidal ideation and attempt. Moreover, minority stress had a direct effect on suicide attempt and an indirect effect on both [ideation and attempt]” (p. 601). Given the multiple impacts minority stress has on an LGBTQ individual, we must also analyze the impacts it has on students’ sense of belonging. Sense of Belonging  Sense of belonging was added to this literature review after the research concluded. During data analysis, a prevalent theme emerged regarding students’ belonging (or lack thereof) at the institution. Though MST was essential in reviewing this data, sense of belonging was necessary to explain the nuanced experiences and determine ways to mitigate minority stress.  Sense of belonging refers to the feeling of connectedness or the idea that someone’s presence matters to another (Rosenberg & McCullough, 1981). Belonging is a psychological term which considers one’s perception of acceptance and social support ( Keene, 2020). This 42  comes by way of engagement with the community and relationship building. Suppose a sense of belonging does not exist. In that case, there is potential for mental health concerns (Hagerty, Williams, & Oe, 2002) as well as poor academic performance (Keene, 2020; Walton & Cohen, 2007) and attrition (Berger, 1997). Summing the importance of Student Life on sense of belonging as Strayhorn (2018) stated: … positive interpersonal, peer interactions increase students’ sense of belonging and sense of belonging leads to student success so those charged with increasing college student success should think just as much about campus climate and policies governing social interactions as they do about predictive analytics, intrusive advising, curricular alignment, and early alert systems (p. 3). Strayhorn makes an important distinction between what leaders care about and what matters regarding a sense of belonging, Student Life, and student success. Strayhorn (2012) also found that students with racial minority identities were likelier to have negative experiences and less sense of belonging, resulting in lesser outcomes. Strayhorn (2012, 2018) makes the connection between Student Life and sense of belonging being important. A review of campus climate research shows that the atmosphere is negative for LGBTQ students. With Student Life being a key player in the campus arena and having significant roots in sense of belonging, it is imperative that sense of belonging be considered for this study as well. Strayhorn (2012) made clear connections between sense of belonging research and students with minority identities, so this is extremely relevant to the current study. Sense of belonging literature thus far has demonstrated its importance in academic success, retention, and health effects. Tying MST and sense of belonging together is Keene 43  (2020), who explained that no belonging due to stigmatization leads to negative health effects, such as suicide. Knowing that a lack of belonging is detrimental to mental and physical health, it makes sense then that introducing and maintaining belonging can buffer or combat such negative effects. Maintaining a sense of belonging can indeed serve as a buffer against these harmful effects (Backhaus et al., 2021; Gopalan, Linden-Carmichael, & Lanza, 2022). These findings also reinforce the work of Strayhorn (2012, 2018), who indicated that minority identity students report lower levels of belonging than their majority peers.  A 2016 study by Vaccaro and Newman was one of the first to explore the intersection of sense of belonging and the LGBTQ identity. Their findings are significant in that there are distinct differences in the perceived belonging of majority and minority students. For example, majority (or privileged in the study) students described belonging as being comfortable or fitting in. Minoritized students said that having safety in their surroundings and respect from others were key in establishing a sense of belonging. This same sentiment was shared when considering clubs and organizations. Majority students described organizations as being “fun” whereas minoritized students sought authentic connections (p. 935). Another important finding from the study was the differentiation of what it meant to build connections. Majority students found connection through task-oriented situations and familiarity whereas minority students required an established, authentic relationship. The discussion thus far has focused on belonging as it relates to student life opportunities. There is also a body of research on belonging in the residential setting.  Blackmon, O’Hara, and Viars (2020) studied microaggressions toward LGBTQ students in residential facilities and found that the “perception of being targeted … [was] a significant negative predictor of sense of belonging” (p. 53). Furthermore, they found that as this perception 44  increased, sense of belonging decreased. Blackmon et al. (2020) also addressed the “value of lived experiences” (p. 53). The work of Sue (2017) is important to highlight as it ties lived experiences to identity in that “microaggressions are about experiential reality and about listening to the voices of the most oppressed, ignored, and silenced” (p. 171). Blackmon et al. (2020) connected sense of belonging to minority stress theory (Meyer, 1995) through the harmful effects that discrimination or microaggressions have on LGBTQ individuals. Related to belonging is the overall campus climate. Campus Climate           Campus climate is “the experience of individuals and groups on a campus - and the quality and extent of the interaction between those various groups and individuals” (Northeastern Illinois University, 2022). This is important for this research because Student Life and Housing & Residence Life are considered part of the campus climate. Therefore, they contribute to the experiences of students on campus. This campus climate literature review will demonstrate the overall negative experiences that LGBTQ students face on college campuses. Several scholars (Bardhoshi et al., 2018; Heaton, 2017; Holland et al., 2013; Rankin et al., 2011; Rankin, 2005; and Wolff et al., 2017) have found that the campus climate is generally negative for LGBTQ individuals. Bardhoshi et al. (2018) explored the campus experiences of LGBTQ students through a qualitative approach called photovoice. Earlier studies like Bardoshi et al. referenced (Rankin et al., 2011) discussed the incidents of harassment that LBGTQ students endure on college campuses. Further, Rankin (2005) found that over 30% of surveyed LGBTQ students had frequently encountered some form of negative experience relating to their identity. Bardoshi et al. used this information when crafting their photovoice study as a means to “illuminate the on-campus experiences of LGBT students…[and used] photovoice to capture key 45  concerns and strengths, both photographically and narratively, pertaining to LGBT students’ on-campus experiences, as well as engaged in critical dialogue and promoted relevant policy development (p. 195). Results of the Bardhoshi et al. study were negative overall with some positives. Researchers coded data and determined major themes, such as categorization, censorship, safe zones, and advocacy. Participants felt they were categorized based on “appearance, their gender expression, or societal gender stereotypes” (p. 201). Other participants felt they had to self-censor based on the campus climate. This meant not engaging in activities or living their true self. The importance of safe zones across campus was stressed by participants, whether it was a person, office, or space. Rankin, Weber, Blumenfield, and Frazer (2010) determined that negative experiences (physical and mental abuse) for LGBTQ students still exist despite advancements in campus climate. As well, LGBTQ students were more likely to describe an adverse campus climate than their heterosexual peers (Brown, Clark, Gortmaker, & Robinson-Keilig, 2004; Gortmaker & Brown, 2006). Advocacy was a general theme as it related to the need for more inclusive policies and an overall better climate for LGBTQ students.          Another study echoing the findings of Bardhoshi. et al. (2018) is Heaton (2017). Heaton found similar themes of navigating identity, transition difficulties, safe spaces, and sympathizing. Also congruent with the Bardhoshi et al. study, Heaton’s is also qualitative. However, they differ because Heaton used a narrative approach instead of photovoice. The narrative approach allows the researcher to utilize storytelling methods and explore the participant’s life experiences. The researcher can then interpret the meaning of the data shared (Creswell, 2013). One difference between the two studies is that Heaton (2017) focuses only on transgender students, whereas Bardhoshi et al. (2018) was broader in scope. 46           Wolff et al. (2017) studied the campus climate and protections at Disallowing Religious Universities (DRUs) and their impact on sexual and gender minority (SGM) students and staff. The study highlights negative actions taken against SGM individuals by DRUs, such as barring admission, expulsion, and hostile environments. Researchers made several recommendations to make campus climates more positive and accepting for LGBTQ students and staff, such as “prohibit[ing] accredited programs from linking sexual and gender minority identities to disciplinary consequences” (p. 253). An example of this is seen in a Canadian legal case where a law school was denied accreditation due to its oppressive code of conduct, explicitly disallowing “sexual expression between same-sex partners, even when such conduct occurs off-campus and within a legal same-sex marriage” (Trinity Western University v. Law Society of Upper Canada, 2018, p. 250). Other recommendations by researchers include ensuring nondiscrimination policies have gender and sexual identity language, transparency, and allowing SGM students to have organizations or networks without retaliation. The final point, organizations and networks, falls in line with other studies such as Cass (1979) and Fassinger (1998a).            Shifting from the qualitative methods generally used in most reviewed LGBTQ literature, the work of Holland et al. (2013) took a quantitative approach where nearly 2,000 college students were surveyed to learn their attitudes towards the LGBT (Q, or queer, was excluded from the title of the study) population. Specifically, the study focused on how various demographics of students' perceptions changed based on the groups they belonged to. For example, examined demographics were political affiliation, religion, gender, sexual orientation, race, class standing, and academic major. This study adapted and furthered the work of a previous study by LaMar and Kite (1998), which entailed a measurement known as the Components of Attitudes Toward Homosexuality Scale. This scale measured participants’ 47  attitudes towards gay and lesbian individuals in four areas: contact, stereotypes, condemnation/tolerance, and morality. The results of the Holland et al. (2013) study were that women, those with liberal Christian traditions or non-Christian faiths, LGBT community members, and upperclassmen had higher levels of tolerance for gay and lesbian individuals. “Lower levels of tolerance [were observed in] republicans, nonparty-affiliated students, African Americans, multiracial students, and College of Business or College of Education students” (p. 586). One study that bridges LGBTQ identity, campus climate, and the Campus Pride Index is Garvey et al. (2017). The work details the creation of the CPI to benchmark higher education institutions for inclusiveness.  This exploration of campus climate related to LGBTQ student experiences has demonstrated that there is not a positive outlook for this minority population. There were described experiences reflecting physical and mental abuse and negative outcomes for LGBTQ students. As was mentioned, Student Life plays an important role in the campus climate. Student Life  The term Student Life (engagement) is inclusive of many different activities. Trowler (2010, p. 3) stated that “student engagement is concerned with the interaction between the time, effort and other relevant resources invested by both students and their institutions intended to optimize the student experience and enhance the learning outcomes and development of students.” This includes clubs, sports, organizations, service-learning, and other student engagement opportunities. However, it has also been noted that the presence of a resource does not mean it is effective. Fuller (2015) found that though students were aware of resources, they often chose to utilize their friends or organizations for support. Several scholars (Bardhoshi et al., 2018; Heaton, 2017; Holland et al., 2013; Rankin et al., 2011; Rankin, 2005; and Wolff et al., 48  2017) have found that the campus climate is generally negative for LGBTQ individuals. Rankin et al. (2011) discussed the incidents of harassment that LBGTQ students endure on college campuses. Further, Rankin (2005) found that over 30% of surveyed LGBTQ students had frequently encountered some form of negative experience relating to their identity. Results of the Bardhoshi et al. (2018) study were negative overall with some positives. Major themes emerged: categorization, censorship, safe zones, and advocacy. Participants felt they were categorized based on “appearance, their gender expression, or societal gender stereotypes” (p. 201). Other participants felt they had to self-censor based on the campus climate.  Housing & Residence Life  Student housing has been around since the 1600s (Martin, 2019). However, the context and type of housing (major-themed, gendered, and so on), including key ideations of the purpose of student housing, have changed. The dated terminology calls student housing dorms or dormitories (Central Oregon Community College, 2022). Nowadays, practitioners frown upon this language because they argue that current structures do more than provide a place to sleep. Instead of the term dorm, current practitioners prefer residence hall. In these spaces, students sleep and engage in learning, development, and community building. It is also well known that students living in campus housing perform better academically than their off-campus peers (Bigano, 2008). This can be attributed to many factors, including the learning environment of the residence hall, proximity to classes, and social experiences attributed to that environment (Anderson, 2020). Many scholars have researched varying aspects of the residential experience.   Heasley (2021) explored the impact gender had on the residential living experience. It was found that gender was a factor in determining a sense of community. Within this study, 49  Heasley also found that the physical design of a residence hall impacted one’s sense of community. This ties directly into the present study as the CPI evaluates factors such as this and assigns a score in return. Building on this, Wagner, Marine, and Nicolazzo (2018) explored the experiences of trans students in gender-inclusive housing. They found that gender-inclusive housing was appreciated, but other barriers still lessened the experience, such as oversight of processes and procedures by cis-identifying staff. Again, this ties nicely into the current study due to the CPI assigning scores based on the presence of a resource. As we see here, the presence of gender-inclusive housing does not mean a positive experience. Fuller (2015) found that LGBTQ students had “feelings of fear, discomfort, and unease when dealing with their peers” (para. 4). For example, some students in the study experienced homophobia when they were holding hands with their partner and “someone screamed ‘Fags!’ and threw a full sealed beer can at [them]” (para. 1). Together, these studies demonstrate that though staff can work to create positive atmospheres, their influence and students themselves can still negatively impact LGBTQ student experiences. This was seen with LGBTQ students describing that cis-identifying staff overseeing processes was still a barrier. Fuller (2015) also demonstrated that the student population is still a force that can negatively impact LGBTQ students (which also speaks to campus climate) through the use of slurs.  Kortegast (2017) explained that staff in those spaces significantly impacted LGBTQ experiences in housing facilities. “LGBT[Q] students’ perceptions of residence life staff affect their experiences within the residence halls” (p. 61). Speaking about the impact that main office housing staff had on their own experience was Wyatt (2021). Wyatt shared that they 50  chose a school based on how inclusive it was rated toward LGBTQ students and, after outing themselves many times to housing staff, still found acceptance and support lacking.   This review of Housing & Residence Life literature is essential for this study because of the critical role that housing facilities play in campus climate. Prior research has demonstrated the benefits of living in such spaces (Anderson, 2020) and the tremendous detriment that housing staff and other students (Fuller, 2015; Wagner, Marine, & Nicolazzo, 2018) on the LGBTQ student experience.  Campus Pride Index Campus Pride History          As discussed earlier, the environment and support networks can drastically impact an individual’s ability to cope, transition, and integrate identity. It comes as no surprise then that campus climate can also affect student transition and success, especially for those from marginalized groups (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Furthermore, this impact is strengthened for LGBTQ students in identity development (Garvey & Rankin, 2015) and academic experiences (Gortmaker & Brown, 2006). Before 2007, “there [were] few tools available to assess the availability of campus LGBTQ-related resources or policies” (Garvey et al., 2017, p. 62). This need for a tool to identify such resources was the root cause for creating the Campus Pride Index.  For this study, the CPI is the campus climate instrument being utilized. This is because it is the primary campus climate inclusivity resource publicly available online. Furthermore, it has a significant national reach with institutions across the country in its catalog.           The CPI stems from its parent organization, Campus Pride (CP) (Campus Pride, 2020). CP was founded in 2001 by Shane Windmeyer, who is also a “leading author on LGBTQ campus issues, national leader in civil rights and a champion for LGBTQ issues on college 51  campuses” (para. 2). The organization is the only national 501(c)(3) nonprofit for creating LGBT-inclusive college environments. The mission and vision of CP are to “develop, support and give ‘voice and action’ in building future LGBT and ally student leaders” and to “develop students leaders, campus networks, and future actions to…[create] campuses and a society free of anti-LGBT prejudice, bigotry, and hate,” respectively (paras. 2-3). With this guiding mission in mind, the CPI was created. CPI Founding and Guiding Principles          Created in 2007, the CPI was a joint effort between LGBTQ advocates and researchers and the Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals (Garvey et al., 2017). When the CPI was founded, a set of primary goals guided the instrument. According to Campus Pride (2020), the goals were a) to create national LGBTQ benchmarking standards, b) to provide an instrument to measure campus inclusivity for LGBTQ individuals, c) to create a list of LGBTQ-friendly college campuses for prospective individuals, d) to support LGBTQ recruitment efforts, and e) to inform national LGBTQ policy and societal advancement. Further, the CPI measures eight factors on college campuses (Campus Pride, 2020). These factors are a) policy inclusion, b) support & institutional commitment, c) academic life, d) student life, e) housing and residence life, f) campus safety, g) counseling and health, and h) recruitment and selection. These eight factors are then used as overarching themes for several questions on the CPI instrument (see Appendix A). Unfortunately, the questionnaire is not readily available online for viewing. Initially, Campus Pride states that the questions are viewable if an account is made and the individual is a campus authority. However, after reviewing site data and information, it was noted that a checklist of questions and whether the 52  institution meets the various statements is available at the bottom of the page for all institutions that post their scores.          Garvey et al. (2017) explained that the CPI instrument is completed by a campus authority with knowledge of campus details, supports, policies, and needs relating to the LGBTQ community. The official submits the responses to CP, and a report is received with a rating, which falls within a 5-star scoring system. Five stars are equivalent to a perfect rating, whereas one star is the poorest rating. An important caveat to the rating process is that campuses have the option to disclose their score publicly. Any institution can choose not to disclose its rating on the CPI site.          Included in the institution's scoring packet are several materials that can be utilized to improve the score and what possible next steps could be (Garvey et al., 2017). For example, it would include literature readings for select topics, who key stakeholders might be, and the offer of a free consultation with Campus Pride.  CPI Implications          The Campus Pride Index has several implications. One such use of the CPI would be for LGBTQ student college recruitment. Squire and Mobley (2014) found that there is little research on LGBTQ recruitment, but there is a need to support students once they are on college campuses. The authors also believe there is a need for university administrators to understand the importance of college choice for LGBTQ students. Further, the CPI is an easy way to demonstrate the LGBTQ inclusiveness of an institution. “The Campus Pride Index is an ideal instrument for administrators to use when preparing marketing and recruitment materials to indicate the steps that an institution is taking to improve the campus climate for LGBTQ 53  students” (Garvey et al., 2017, p. 66). Given the notion that the CPI can be a lucrative recruitment and marketing tool, it is important to consider students' lived experiences on such campuses.          Policy adjustment and LGBTQ student advocacy are significant implications of using the CPI. Since policy and support are built into the CPI, they make it a natural area to benefit from CPI scoring. For example, an institution may view its policies as inclusive, but after CPI analysis and national benchmarking, the policy may no longer be considered in such a light. Garvey et al. (2017) stated, “inclusive policies also influence how LGBTQ students perceive and experience their campus’s climate. Campus administrators and policymakers have used the CPI to inform policy creation and revision to foster LGBTQ inclusion for [community members]” (p. 67). Similar ideology can be applied to supporting students through advocacy. Since the CPI can be seen as a comparative tool, benchmarking for best practices is also a possible outcome. For example, institutions in the Southeastern Conference may use each other's CPI scores to benchmark practices within their division. If one institution has a resource that another does not, the CPI can justify allocating resources to allow it. The Campus Pride Index is an innovative instrument created by LGBTQ advocates to increase inclusiveness on college campuses. Its multistep approach allows institutions to self-report data and get individually catered results. A downside of the CPI is that results are not publicly available if the institution does not wish to disclose its rating. However, there are many implications for the CPI as scores can be used for recruitment, policy improvement, and LGBTQ student advocacy.   54  Relevance and Future Studies          This literature review is relevant because it combines scholarship on minority stress theory and campus climate. It later discusses the Campus Pride Index, a relatively new campus climate assessment tool. It concludes with a discussion of minority stress theory and its implications regarding mental and physical health. The history of both CP and the CPI was explored. Appendix A elaborates on the eight guiding factors that the CPI uses to measure an institution’s LGBTQ inclusiveness. Finally, there was lengthy research on the adverse health effects caused by minority stress. This literature review impacts future studies because there is a lack of scholarship in measuring the accuracy of the CPI. There have been comments on using the CPI as an LGBTQ recruitment tool or resource; however, there is no data confirming the lived experiences of an LGBTQ student would match an institution’s rating. Further, this review has clarified the importance of a safe, supportive, and welcoming campus climate for individual and sexual identity development. Determining the accuracy of the CPI would aid in this process as it relates directly to measuring a campus climate. Additionally, the factors contributing to the CPI rating need to be considered as they relate to the scoring itself and how they impact or cause minority stress to the LGBTQ students at the institution.  This study is at a large, public, research, 4-year university in the Midwest. Therefore, the study's results may not apply to all institutions, especially those of different demographics, such as private, small to mid-size, or different political leanings. Future research areas would be to expand this study to different types of institutions or other underrepresented groups. Significance There is extensive research on LGBTQ populations, such as Bardhoshi et al. (2018), which explored documenting LGBTQ experiences through photovoice, and Garvey and Rankin 55  (2015), who explored campus climate impacts on LGBTQ individuals. Tying this together is the notion that Schuh, Jones, and Torres (2017) elaborate on, which is that “perceptions of hostility, conflict, and marginalization in their campus communities can have negative implications for development, learning, achievement, and persistence” (p. 73). This study is significant because there is little research on the accuracy of campus climate tools or how they relate to minority stress. This study aims to examine the relationship between the institutional CPI rating, individual lived experiences, and the impact that these experiences have on mental and physical health as they relate to minority stress. To further the work of those before this study and create change, or at the very least share findings, the contents of the study will be shared in two different ways. The first is a contribution to practice, and the latter is a contribution to scholarship. For contribution to practice, there is a discussion on who key parties at the institution are to effect change. Since this study goes beyond the institution when considering the CPI tool, it would make sense also to share findings with Campus Pride. Following this discussion is a proposed timeline.  56  Section Four - Contribution to Practice   To contribute to practice, there will be a presentation in the academic college that provided funding for this study. One of the offices within the college routinely hosts diversity dialogues, and an inquiry request to host a presentation on this research has been made. This presentation would be open to students, faculty, and staff at the institution. In addition, there would be personal invitations to leaders and staff in the target areas of this study – Student Life, Housing & Residence Life, and the identity offices. This presentation will occur in April 2023, when the institution under study celebrates Pride Month.  Does the Campus Pride Index Reflect Lived Experiences? A Qualitative and Minority Stress Approach to Studying LGBTQ Students in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life Thomas A. JosephJune 21st, 2022  Hello, everyone. Thank you for being here today as I share the findings of some important research I have recently completed. The title of this presentation is, Does the Campus Pride Index Reflect Lived Experiences? A Qualitative and Minority Stress Approach to Studying LGBTQ students in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life. 57  Purpose of the StudyThe purpose of this study was to: • Learn how LGBTQ students described their lived experiences in Student Life (SL) and Housing & Residence Life (HRL),• Explore differences between the Campus Pride Index (CPI) rating and lived experiences,• Use minority stress theory (MST) to determine if these experiences had any impact on mental and physical health.  The target audience for this study is LGBTQ students, institutional staff and senior leaders, and the non-profit Campus Pride. There were three purposes of this study. The first was to learn how LGBTQ students describe their lived experiences in both Student Life and Housing & Residence Life. The second is to explore differences between the Campus Pride Index and those lived experiences. And third, to use minority stress theory to determine if these experiences impacted mental and physical health.  The target audience of this study was LGBTQ students, institutional staff, senior leaders, and the non-profit Campus Pride. Given that the CPI is one of the few instruments to measure campus inclusivity towards LGBTQ students, and that it has been suggested to be a recruitment tool, it is important to review differences in the CPI rating and lived experiences. This provides the ability for LGBTQ students to be more informed in college choice and institutional leaders to better grasp the effectiveness and accessibility of reported resources.   58        To do this, three research questions were developed. First, how do LGBTQ students at the institution describe their experiences in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life?  Second, are there differences in the assigned Campus Pride Index rating for the areas of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life, and the reported experience of students at that institution? And finally, does minority stress impact LGBTQ students at the institution, particularly in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life? And with those minority stress impacts, how can sense of belonging work to combat them?    59  Literature ReviewCampus Climate• Most LGBTQ students describe negative campus experiences due to hostility from peers, policies, procedures, and general atmosphere (Brown, Clark, Gortmaker, & Robinson-Keilig, 2004; Gortmaker & Brown, 2006; Holland et al., 2013; Rankin, Weber, Blumenfield, and Frazer, 2010; Wolff et al., 2020).Campus Pride Index• Created in 2007• Policy inclusion,• Support and institutional commitment,• Academic life,• Student life (5 out of 5),• Housing and residence life (4 out of 5),• Campus safety,• Counseling and health,• Recruitment and selection• The CPI has been mentioned as a recruitment tool for institutions (Garvey, et. al., 2017).  To fully grasp minority stress and the environment in which students live, we must first have a baseline understanding of campus climate. Northeastern Illinois University defines campus climate as the “experience of individuals and groups on the campus and the quality and extent of the interaction between those various groups and individuals.” So that being said, several scholars have found that the campus climate for LGBTQ students is generally negative. And that's why the Campus Pride Index was in part developed in 2007. Some scholars have called for it to be a recruitment tool for LGBTQ students. There are eight factors in the index. They are policy and inclusion, support and institutional commitment, academic life, student life, housing and residence life, campus safety, counseling and health, and recruitment and selection. The two areas that I'm studying are Student Life and Housing & Residence Life. Student Life scored five out of five in the index, and Housing & Residence Life scored four out of five. 60  Literature ReviewStudent Life• The interaction between the institution and the student aimed to engage both parties to bolster overall experience (Trowler, 2010). • Within these constructs, students have experienced censorship, needs for advocacy, choosing not to utilize campus resources, and high rates of negative encounters (Bardhoshi et al., 2018; Fuller, 2015; Rankin, 2005; Rankin et al., 2011).• Sense of belonging - a feeling of connectedness or that one matters (Rosenberg & McCullough, 1981). • Minority identity (Strayhorn, 2012)• No belonging (Berger, 1997; Hagerty, Williams, & Oe, 2002; Walton & Cohen, 2007).  Student Life is the next major area to focus on in this literature review. Student life plays into all parts of campus climate, especially with student life being a target area of this study. One scholar, Trowler, defines student life as the interaction between the institution and the student aimed at engaging both parties to bolster the overall experience. And within these constructs, students have experienced censorship, advocacy needs, choosing not to utilize resources on campus, and even high rates of negative encounters, as previously mentioned, but a sense of belonging can counter that. A sense of belonging, defined by Rosenberg and McCullough, is a feeling of connectedness or that one matters. So, I see people that are like me. I feel that I belong, that I matter. And Strayhorn has found that if you have a minority identity, you're less likely to have this sense of belonging, or it is more challenging to get that sense of belonging. And then other scholars have found that if you have no belonging at all, you're more likely to have negative mental health concerns, poor academic performance, or even attrition from the university. 61  Literature ReviewHousing & Residence Life• Housing students perform better academically (Anderson, 2020; Bigano, 2008).• Housing staff can greatly impact the LGBTQ student experience (Kortegast, 2017; Wyatt, 2021).• The structural design of HRL facilities impacts LGBTQ student experiences (Heasley, 2021).• Housing staff and peers influence experience (Fuller, 2015; Wagner, Marine, & Nicolazzo, 2018).  Another major area of the study will be Housing and Residence Life. We know that housing students perform better academically than their off-campus peers. We also know that the LGBTQ student experience can be significantly impacted by the staff that works in those facilities. And another scholar, Heasley, has found that even the design of a facility can affect the experience. So, for that, we're thinking, where are the bathrooms, and how are the halls designed? Where do people live, and what's the overall design of that space? And then, we also know that even the peers, not just the staff, but the peers you live with, can also impact your experience as an LGBTQ student. 62  Literature ReviewMinority Stress Theory• A basic tenet of MST is that people with minority identities endure higher levels of mental health concerns than their majority peers (Meyer, 1995, 2003). • Prejudice, stigma, and discrimination (Fulginiti et al., 2020; Polihronakis et al., 2021; Silverschanz et al., 2008). • LGBTQ students make up just 17% of college students (Postsecondary National Policy Institute, 2021)  And finally, minority stress theory. So, a basic tenet of minority stress theory is that people with minority identities endure higher levels of mental health concerns than their majority peers. And this comes in the form of prejudice, stigma, and discrimination. And why choose minority stress theory for this study? Nationally, LGBTQ students make up just 17% of college students. So, they are a minority by that metric, and minority stress theory would apply to them.   63   Methods• Qualitative case study• Snowball (chain) sampling was used to recruit participants for this study:• Students, staff, and listserv• Meyer, 1995• 60 – 90 min. semi-structured interviews• MST and CPI infused throughout interview protocol (Pachankis, 2014).• QDA MinerTable 1Participant DemographicsPseudonym Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity Class StandingArisha Grainger Asexual Graduate/ProfessionalNeal Adkins Bisexual UndergraduateHarrison Reilly Gay Graduate/ProfessionalAda Graham Gay UndergraduateCalahan Barnett Gay UndergraduateBrent Le Gay UndergraduateDuke Ritter Gay UndergraduateAlexa Zamora Gay UndergraduateKye Mcneil Gay UndergraduateTashan Almond Trans UndergraduateJameel Dixon Trans UndergraduateAnanya Small Trans UndergraduateMartin Hester Trans UndergraduateMargot Antonio Trans UndergraduateVinny Hanson Undisclosed Graduate/ProfessionalLynn Armitage Undisclosed Graduate/Professional  This study was a qualitative case study, which entailed snowball or chain sampling to recruit participants. What this meant was that I identified key informants in the population. And once I interviewed them or interacted with them, I asked them to pass along my information to further the study. And this is how I recruited all the participants. All interviews were 60 to 90 minutes long and were semi-structured. So, there were open- and closed-ended questions. And throughout all of this, minority stress theory was applied through the interview protocol. For example, tenants from Pachankis were utilized. This includes fostering community, empowerment, and validation throughout the protocol. The CPI itself was also used. At times, participants were shown the index rating for various areas and responded accordingly. For this study, QDA Miner was utilized as a qualitative tool. So, all coding was done in the software and data export.  For my participants, this institution has more than 30,000 students. They are comprised of 20,000 undergraduates, 6,000 graduates, and 1,500 professionals. This institution is 64  predominantly White, with nearly 24,000 students who identify as White. Approximately 75% of students are in-state, and almost 90% are Pell-eligible. In this study, 16 participants represented several LGBTQ identities and class standings. You can see on the table here more information on those demographics. The study occurred at a large, public, four-year, research-intensive institution in the Midwest. It participates in Division One athletics, has more than 600 clubs and organizations, and nearly 7,000 students live in campus housing.   65  MethodsData Analysis• Open coding (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016) completed in QDA Miner, followed by analytical coding (Richards, 2015).• Data export into Excel and tying of quotes to themes (Sandelowski, 1994).• From this, major themes emerged (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).• Determination of whether any patterns emerged between subgroups within the participant demographics (Meyer, 2003).   Coding occurred in two ways in the study. The first was open coding, meaning that when I was going through the data and the transcripts, I had no bias and was looking for anything interesting or impactful. I later moved into analytical coding, where I began grouping codes together that were similar. And this was all done in QDA Miner as well. I later exported all of the data out of QDA Miner into Excel. And this helped me to tie quotes to major themes. This is something that we also saw in the work of Sandelowski. So, we're finding that we have a theme; what data or quotes make that exist, and why is that important? And then, from here, major themes came to exist. These are themes that can exist independently and do not need other data to tell a story. They are impactful across the data. And then, as is common in some minority stress studies, subgroup determination was done. So, for example, within the LGBTQ community, how does this instance impact a lesbian student compared to a gay student and then so on?  The researcher’s positionality is important to disclose for this study. They are biased in this area due to their ten years of experience in student affairs and housing. During this time, 66  they developed a passion for creating socially just environments for students, faculty, and staff through advocacy for policy change and implementation or revision of resources. Later in their career, the researcher held a role emphasizing student sense of belonging and wellbeing. In this capacity, the researcher could secure resources across division and unit lines to best support students of all identities and backgrounds. This role also demonstrated to the researcher that the experiences and accessibility of resources for minority students at the institution are insufficient. Through a combination of passions and relevant work experience, the idea and direction of this study came to fruition.   To combat this bias, the researcher utilized various methods to ensure data collection and findings were accurate. First, the results were compared to that of other scholars referenced earlier. Next, participants were asked if what was heard was accurate through paraphrasing. And finally, staff that are close to the topic were briefed on findings throughout the process to determine if anything was off-base. By combining these methods, the researcher’s bias was not impactful on the results or conclusions of this study.   67  FindingsMental HealthPositive or Neutral Impacts• “Having the [center] really helped with my depression.”  - Speaking of the LGBTQ center on campus.• “In regards to the queer community, it had very little impact on my mental or physical health, mostly because I’ve been able to make connections through which I suppose would help my mental health.” – Explaining that their identity does not impact their mental health because of the community they’ve found.*No participant explicitly discussed physical health impacts  Findings from this research are significant in that they demonstrate clear differences between the Campus Pride Index rating and student experiences. In addition, they show high variances between the reported and actual institutional commitment, express evident impacts on mental health, and invoke concern for current practices and procedures in both Student Life and Housing. The five major themes that emerged are mental health, rating variances, student experiences with identity and sense of belonging, Housing & Residence Life staff, and lack of institutional support.  For mental health, students never explicitly mentioned their physical health, though mental health was present throughout the entire presentation or in the conversation. For example, students said, \"having the center really helped with my depression.” And another said, “In regards to the queer community it had very little impact on my mental or physical health, mostly because I've been able to make connections through which I suppose would help my mental health.” So, we have two students here saying, you know, my identity didn't impact my health because I was able to counter that through a sense of longing through meeting other people. Or 68  they're just saying my identity did not impact my health. They're not related. And then it gets a little bit more negative when you remove these aspects.   69  FindingsMental HealthNegative Impacts• “I have had times where I’ve been getting ready to walk into the building … and realized, oh wait, my heart is racing, everything just feels really heavy right and there’s a real, I think it’s a trauma response.” – Student describing a trauma response when entering a building where they have had significant, negative experiences.• “Working in [HRL] had a very negative impact on my mental health and that is why I left.” – A former HRL staff member sharing why they chose to leave their position with the department.*No participant explicitly discussed physical health impacts  So, there was one student that said, “I have had times where I've been getting ready to walk into the building and realized, oh, wait, my heart is racing. Everything just feels really heavy. Right. And there's a real, I think that's a trauma response.” Then another student said that “working in [HRL] had a very negative impact on my mental health, and that is why I left.” So, this student is speaking about the attrition we heard about earlier. If you don't feel that you belong, it has a negative impact on your health, you're going to leave. Or like the first student who is exhibiting that trauma response. So, they're not saying that something is physically happening to me, they're saying it's a mental health response, but that's also physical, and that's important to know.  70  FindingsRating VariancesSL Rating is Misleading• “Oh, that feels like bullshit.” – First impression when shown the CPI rating for SL.• The CPI “improperly gives the school a higher rating.”  - Student explaining that they believe the CPI inflates the institution’s score.• It is “just a pattern of disappointment.” – Student explaining why they feel the score is too high.HRL Rating is Misleading• Training is “maybe an hour in the afternoon” and it “just describes more so what it means to be in the LGBT community and different aspects of that rather than like the problems they face in HRL or you know in their lives.” – Student explaining how brief and superficial LGBTQ training is in department.  The next major findings are in the rating variances. So, the reported index score is not the same as what somebody would say their experience has been. In student life, it was described as being misleading. One person said, “Oh, that feels like bullshit,” when they were first shown the rating, and other student said that they feel that the index “improperly gives the school a higher rating.” And finally, another student said it's “just a pattern of disappointment.” These students are saying that this institution's perfect score for Student Life is not accurate based on their own experiences.  And then for housing, specifically as a staff member, a student said, “training is maybe an hour in the afternoon,” and it “just describes more so what it means to be in the LGBT community, and different aspects of that rather than like problems that they face, in [HRL] or in their lives.” So, the index gives housing an extra point for training all staff on LGBTQ issues. This staff member says the training exists, but it’s ineffective. It’s too short, and it’s superficial.   71  FindingsStudent Experiences with Identity and Sense of BelongingClubs and Organizations• “It’s not really on [the university], it’s more on the students to make something [happen].” – The institution does not organize LGBTQ programming; student organizations must do this.• “I’ve been trying to look into whether or not there is an intersex club and whether or not we would need to create one, because I think that’s like a niche that ‘ought to have been filled by now.” – Explanation of how students support other students and fill gaps in support.• Clubs are “empowering in that sense to where I’m like, I know that it’s not just me out here, you know, there’s other people there.” – Student explaining that they feel empowered by not being alone.  Considering student experiences with their identity and sense of belonging is very positive when we look at clubs and organizations. “It's not really on [the university], it's more on students to make something happen.” “I've been trying to look into whether or not there is an intersex club and whether or not we would need to create one because I think like that's a niche that ought to have been filled by now.” These students are saying the university is not doing the programming or providing support for students. It's the students that need to do it themselves. And another student said clubs are “empowering in the sense to where I'm like, I know it's not just me out here, you know, there are other people there.” So, they find that sense of belonging through camaraderie, likeness, and seeing people like themselves. When we take the sense of belonging to clubs and organizations away, it turns to be a little more negative.  72  FindingsStudent Experiences with Identity and Sense of BelongingStudent Life• “They [the institution] give us a small space in the basement to congregate.” – Student explaining that LGBTQ students have a designated office space in the basement of a building to meet. • “It’s definitely more comfortable to put on that straight face than to maybe be my whole true self.” – Student explaining that they must self-censor or hide their identity instead of be authentic.HRL• “Whenever I was interacting with them [roommate], you know, I would deepen my voice.”  - An example of code-switching for safety or acceptance. • “[Speaking of gender-neutral housing] the fact that it’s only in one dorm.” – Speaking to inaccessibility of gender-neutral housing since it is only offered in one dorm.  In Student Life, a student said, “They [the institution] gives us a small space in the basement to congregate.” They're speaking to the location of their LGBTQ center. And this is, you know, it's in the basement. And not only that, at the time of this interview, there had been a flood several months earlier that ruined that space's flooring and had not been replaced yet. So not only is their space in the basement of a building, but it’s also not furnished. It's missing the flooring, and another student said, “It’s definitely more comfortable to put on that straight face than to maybe be my whole true self.” This student is saying that it's easier to act straight than to show their true identity because it's more comfortable that way.  When we're in housing, one student said, “whenever I interact with them, [my roommate] you know, I would deepen my voice.” So, they're speaking to code-switching, to speaking differently to have more acceptance or safety. And other students said, “[speaking of gender-neutral housing] the fact that it's only in one dorm.” So, this is speaking to the idea of the structural design of locations of bathrooms or housing and things of that nature. So, if it is only in one location, it's not accessible, and students say that. 73  FindingsHRL StaffHRL Staff Interactions• “The [housing staff] made no mention of, like, knowing or understanding [my identity].” – A common comment from students when they explained that HRL staff made no overt support of their identity.• “There was a fellow I worked under, and [they were] really happy to dead name any of the trans students that worked under [them].” – Former staff member explaining homophobic experiences with professional staff.  For housing staff, there was a large difference between the experiences of a general student compared to the experiences of a former or current staff member. Students that were not staff members generally had a neutral experience. That was because they didn't know whether or not housing staff could be a resource for them. One student said, “the [housing staff] made no mention of knowing or understanding [my identity].” So, if the institution and this department are receiving credit for training their staff, why can't their staff convey that to students? As a staff member, the perception is more pessimistic. One student said, “there was a fellow that I worked under, and [they were] really happy to dead name any of the trans students that worked under them.” And a dead name is the birth name of a trans person after choosing a new name for themselves. Using someone’s dead name is considered to be transphobic and homophobic. It is very disrespectful. It shouldn't ever happen. And in these described environments, a sense of belonging can't exist. 74  FindingsLack of Institutional SupportIdentity Center Restructuring• “The whole thing last year … where [senior leader] came in and was doing a big switch up with how things were run in the big restructure. I was never an incredible fan of it.” – Student explaining their take on the identity center restructure.• Speaking of senior leaders, they are “just defending [their] position instead of actually like making progress.”  - A description of why students do not find senior leaders to be effective.Performative Nature of Institution and Senior Leaders• “We held a rally against anti-trans legislation and tried to educate people and they [the institution] took every opportunity they had to try and shut that down.” – Describing why they felt the institution worked against them instead of being supportive.• It is “a lot of lip service and not a lot of real support and engagement directly.” – A student explaining why they feel leaders are performative.  And finally, lack of institutional support. A prominent theme throughout the discussions was restructuring the identity centers on campus. So, about a year ago, all the centers that support various student identities had a significant restructure, including the staff that ran them. One student said, “the whole thing last year … where [senior leader] came in and was doing a big switch up with how things were run in the big restructure. I was never an incredible fan of it.” And other students said, speaking of senior leaders, they're “just defending their position instead of actually like making progress.” So, we have two students here saying that we're advocating for ourselves, but we're not getting anywhere. Sometimes senior leaders even push their agenda and don't listen to us.  And some students also describe senior leaders or the institution to be performative. For example, “we had a rally against anti-trans legislation and tried to educate people, and they are the institution took every opportunity they had there's try and shut it down.” So recently, there has been anti-trans legislation trying to be passed, and students are trying to protest against that on campus. And though there might be procedures on campus that you need to go through to 75  have a rally, students are saying we're trying to do that, and the institution is working against us; they're making it more difficult than it needs to be. And one student summed up all of this very well. They said it is “a lot of lip service and not a lot of real support and engagement directly.” So, in short, they're saying they talk and talk and don't take action on their words.   76  DiscussionMental Health• Major theme due to its significant prevalence throughout the transcripts as well as its high degree of impact on the student experience and LGBTQ identity (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Meyer, 1995, 2003; Silverschanz et al., 2008).• Furthermore, as Fulginiti et al. found, “thwarted belongingness” is also detrimental to mental health (p. 601). This is supported by Strayhorn (2012, 2018) who spoke about the importance a sense of belonging has for students and how seriously senior leaders need to consider it.  Results are as expected in many areas. Prior research such as that of Brown, Clark, Gortmaker, and Robinson-Keilig, as well as that of Gortmakerr and Brown, found that LGBTQ students were more likely to describe negative campus experiences than their heterosexual peers. Also, as expected, many students described negative impacts on their mental health. This is in line with minority stress theory. A major finding of this study is that the assigned Campus Pride Index scores do not reflect lived experiences of LGBTQ students at the institution in both Student Life and Housing & Residence Life.  For mental health, it became a major theme due to its significant prevalence throughout all transcripts and interviews and a high degree of impact on the student experience and the LGBTQ identity. Furthermore, Fulginiti et al. found that “thwarted belongingness,” so no sense of belonging is detrimental to mental health. However, we know from Strayhorn that if you have a minority identity, you're less likely to have a sense of belonging and, thus, more mental health concerns. 77  DiscussionRating Variances• Students’ level of agreement depended on their interactions with housing staff (Kortegast, 2017; Wyatt, 2021).• The CPI gives credit for something existing and not whether or not it is utilized or even known about (Fuller, 2015).Student Experiences with Identity and Sense of Belonging• Positive experiences associated with clubs and organizations or the community they found (Fuller, 2015; Strayhorn, 2012, 2018). • Negative experiences with code-switching and hiding identity, speaking to Bardhoshi et al. (2018) findings of censorship.• Gay students felt there was focus on the gay identity whereas Trans students felt there was focus on the LGBTQ umbrella.  When considering rating variances, a student's level of agreement depended on their interactions with housing staff. For example, was that staff member supportive, or were they knowledgeable on the issue? And generally, students found that the index gave credit for something that may exist even if the resource is not utilized. For example, in student life, the index gives credit for LGBTQ-specific career resources, but no student that was interviewed was able to speak to what that actually meant. And then there's also, for example, the training that exists in housing for housing staff. And it also speaks to, for example, gender-neutral housing. They receive credit for gender-neutral housing, but students say it's only in one location, so that's not accessible.  Regarding student experiences with identity and sense of belonging, positive experiences were generally associated with clubs and organizations. These findings fall in line with Strayhorn’s results on belonging and identity. There were also negative experiences found with code-switching with a roommate or hiding identity to be more comfortable, which speaks to Bardhoshi et al.’s censorship findings. And as was mentioned earlier, Sin the subgroup analysis 78  in this study, the only major difference between LGBTQ identities was that gay students found that there was a more significant focus on the gay identity, and one person described it as being that the gay identity is more palpable compared to other identities. Trans students found a more significant focus on the LGBTQ umbrella or community as a whole instead of individual identities.   79    In housing, the general student doesn't know whether or not staff are allies. And if you're a staff member, your experience is primarily negative—for example, the description of homophobic or transphobic staff members from some students.  For lack of institutional support, it's time that institutions and senior leaders consider the sense of belonging a critical metric for student success. Students made it clear that their sense of belonging isn't considered when they advocate against pending changes, and nobody listens to them. This also applies to spaces that students utilize. For example, their space right now is in the basement of a building, and it's not furnished.  80  ImplicationsThe CPI Instrument• The CPI instrument needs revised.• Presence of a resource does not mean it is effective.Institutional Support• Institution and leaders need to act on their words.• Currently, resources exist to look good on paper.• LGBTQ students are advocating for more accessible resources and support in their initiatives.  This study has the potential for significant implications in higher education settings. Results fill the gap in literature and practice and determine whether there are differences between the assigned CPI rating, and the LGBTQ student lived experiences. It also answered how minority stress theory applies to these same individuals. Results of this study address these gaps by demonstrating the clear need for improvements in areas such as the Campus Pride Index instrument, institutional support, Housing and Residence Life, sense of belonging, and minority stress. For the Campus Pride Index instrument, it needs to be revised. Its checklist method of, does something exist or does it not, is not effective. Students don't know whether or not things exist or how to utilize them, even though they're listed as being there. The presence of a resource doesn't mean that it's effective.  One way this can be done is by delving deeper into each area the Index gives credit for. If a resource is offered, that can serve as a great baseline. Still, the CPI or the institutional authority needs to determine if that resource is accessible and effective. Additionally, students should be connected to this process to get constituent buy-in. This might be done through focus 81  groups, surveys, or interviews. CPI would then be able to publish use statistics alongside the resources to provide a more robust instrument. These approaches would also allow senior leaders to modify resources to implement new ones with the feedback from students.  Institutions and leaders need to act on their words. If they say they will do something, they need to do it. They need to follow through on it. Right now, it seems that they say things, that the index gives credit for items that look good on paper, but in reality, they’re ineffective. LGBTQ students are advocating for more accessible resources and support in their initiatives. We need to listen to them.   82  ImplicationsHRL Selection and Training• Staff are not adequality trained or cannot demonstrate knowledge.• Concerns of homophobic staff create opportunity for revised hiring system.Minority Stress• Pay more attention to, and listen to LGBTQ students and their needs.• Address sense of belonging issues at the institution for LGBTQ students.Future Research• Remaining six CPI factors,• Impacts on faculty and staff,• Other institutions  For housing selection and training, staff are not adequately trained or don't know how to demonstrate their LGBTQ knowledge. So, one staff member said that their training is insufficient. But is it possible that others don't have the opportunity or they don't know how to demonstrate the knowledge that they've learned? So, opportunities need to be made for those trainings need to be revamped with more time committed. And then there's also the concern for homophobic staff. This creates an opportunity for a revised hiring system that includes more difficult questions in an interview, higher education requirements, and more robust screening protocols. For example, the institution’s LGBTQ center offers training on LGBTQ issues. This would be a great initial step to improving staff training. Though it may be a several-hour course, the outcome would provide staff with a better knowledge of LGBTQ issues. This is also a training that can be required across all housing staff, not only the resident advisors in the halls. The LGBTQ center can also be referenced as a topic expert in changing the student and professional staff interview questions. Many institutions require a base level of diversity education, so the idea of implementing something similar would not go against best practices. 83  For student staff, implementing group interviews with a focus on diversity activities would be one way to identify bias amongst candidates. For minority stress, there needs to be more attention paid to LGBTQ students and their needs. And this comes through addressing sense of belonging at the institution for LGBTQ students. The study shows that minority stress does impact the students, and the institution isn't doing enough to counter that stress. Many areas of future research exist from this study. I only considered two of the eight factors in the Campus Pride Index. There are another six factors that can be considered with similar research. I also only consider the impacts on students. There's still room for research on faculty and staff as they're also considered in the Campus Pride Index. And finally, there's the possibility for additional research at different institution types. This study was conducted at a large, Midwest institution. It could be done in a different geographic location, a different size institution, or a private school.   84   ConclusionThis qualitative study sheds light on the importance of:• A sense of belonging for students to combat minority stress,• Clear issues in both practice and support from the institution. It also demonstrated the need for:• A more robust recruitment and training process for HRL,• Revisions to the CPI instrument,• Institutions to critically review the impacts minority stress has on its students and to shift focus to creating and maintaining a sense of belonging.With the multitude of negative experiences described and the consistent failure to support LGBTQ students, it is imperative senior leaders begin listening to students and take action immediately.  In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of creating a sense of belonging for students to combat minority stress. It shows clear issues in both practice and support from the institution. And it offers a demonstrated need for a better recruitment and training process for housing and a better Campus Pride Index instrument. There is a clear difference between the assigned CPI rating of the institution, and the LGBTQ student lived experience. This is not the institution taking advantage of the Index. Instead, the Index is not built in a way to consider all of the nuances of the LGBTQ student experience. Unless the Index undergoes significant structural and procedural changes to analyze these nuances better, it will only serve as a baseline level of knowledge for college choice. It is time to critically review the impacts of minority stress on students and how it relates to a sense of belonging. Senior leaders need to start listening to their students and take action immediately because LGBTQ students are being failed. Thank you for your time today.  85  ReferencesAnderson, G. (2020).

Does the Campus Pride Index Reflect Lived Experiences? A Qualitative and Minority Stress Approach to Studying LGBTQ Students in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life   Thomas A. Joseph University of Missouri – Columbia thomasalanjoseph@gmail.com www.linkedin.com/in/tomajoseph ORCiD: 0000-0002-2020-3935  89  Abstract  The Campus Pride Index (CPI) evaluates institutions' inclusivity relative to LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff in eight categories. This study targets two of them, Student Life (SL) and Housing & Residence Life (HRL), and considers the experiences of LGBTQ students. The research infused minority stress theory throughout the interview protocol to determine how each area affects an LGBTQ student’s mental and physical health. The major findings of this study were that though a sense of belonging did exist, it was due to the relationships built amongst fellow LGBTQ students and not the institution itself. Furthermore, students felt CPI scores were misleading and that minority stress impacted student mental health in various ways. This research is relevant to college-seeking students, current enrollees, senior administrators, and Campus Pride. Implications of this study are far-reaching in that research data disputes published inclusivity scores in the CPI and demonstrate significant areas where this institution is failing its LGBTQ students.    Keywords: LGBTQ Student, Minority Stress Theory, Sense of Belonging, Campus Pride Index, Student Life, Housing & Residence Life, Mental and Physical Health  90  The Campus Pride Index (CPI) is an online catalog of institutions nationwide that measures campus inclusivity toward the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) population (Campus Pride, 2020). Given that college choice is important, especially for LGBTQ individuals, because of unique needs in areas of “support, academic enrichment, shared interests, and social engagement” (Red Ventures, 2021, para. 1), the Index serves as an important assessment and campus climate tool for college choice and meeting personal needs (Casey, 2014; National Center for Education Statistics, 2012). Furthermore, given the minority status of the population, which is just over 5% of US citizens (Jones, 2021) and roughly 17% (Postsecondary National Policy Institute, 2021) of college students nationally, it is important to consider the implications of minority stress as it relates to the experiences of the students. Minority Stress Theory (MST) describes the physical and psychological impacts of holding a minority identity, such as mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders (Meyer, 2003). The implications of such health hazards must be further analyzed, and the relationship to campus climate should be determined. Purpose of the Study This study aimed to learn how LGBTQ students describe their lived experiences in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life at the institution. Further, to explore differences in the assigned CPI rating for areas of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life and LGBQ student lived experiences at a large, 4-year research university in the Midwest. Since the CPI serves as a potential data source for students and professionals alike in college choice for attendance or employment (Garvey et al., 2017), it is important to determine its accuracy. For example, if the CPI gives an institution a 5-star rating, would students share that they have had a 5-star experience during their time at the institution? This study aims to explore that notion and 91  further determine whether these experiences have had any kind of effect on participants’ mental and physical health. This will be determined through the use of Minority Stress Theory.  Due to the checklist and procedural nature of the questions the CPI utilizes to give the rating, it is suspected that LGBTQ individuals would disagree that their experience would match that of the CPI rating. The CPI uses a questionnaire, which serves as a type of checklist. If the institution meets a certain number of criteria, they receive a corresponding rating. The existence of a policy or procedure does not necessarily imply that all LGBTQ individuals will be influenced by it the same. This study specifically considered the differences between the assigned CPI rating for the institution and the lived experiences of LGBTQ students at the institution in Student Life (SL) and Housing & Residence Life (HRL). Tenets of MST guided all research to determine how the CPI rating and structural factors may contribute to minority stress. The research questions answered were: 1. How do LGBTQ students at the institution describe their experiences in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life? 2. Are there differences in assigned CPI rating for the areas of Student Life and Housing & Residence Life, and the reported experience of students at the institution? 3. Does minority stress impact LGBTQ students at the institution, particularly in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life?  a. How can sense of belonging work to combat the effects of minority stress on LGBTQ students?   92  Literature Review To explore differences in experiences and the rating of the Campus Pride Index and its structural ties to minority stress theory, it was necessary to examine the literature on Campus Climate, Student Life, Housing & Residence Life, the Campus Pride Index, and MST’s applicability to the LGBTQ community.  Campus Climate           Campus climate is “the experience of individuals and groups on a campus—and the quality and extent of the interaction between those various groups and individuals” (Northeastern Illinois University, 2022). This is important for this research because Student Life and Housing & Residence Life are considered part of the campus climate. Therefore, they contribute to the experiences of students on campus. The following literature discussion will demonstrate the overall negative experiences that LGBTQ students have on college campuses. Several scholars (Bardhoshi et al., 2018; Heaton, 2017; Holland et al., 2013; Rankin et al., 2011; Rankin, 2005; and Wolff et al., 2017) have found that the campus climate is generally negative for LGBTQ individuals. Rankin et al. (2011) discussed the incidents of harassment that LBGTQ students endure on college campuses. Further, Rankin (2005) found that over 30% of surveyed LGBTQ students had frequently encountered some form of negative experience relating to their identity. Results of the Bardhoshi et al. (2018) study were negative overall with some positives. Major themes emerged such as categorization, censorship, safe zones, and advocacy. Participants felt they were categorized based on “appearance, their gender expression, or societal gender stereotypes” (p. 201). Other participants felt they had to self-censor based on the campus climate.  93  Wolff et al. (2020) studied the campus climate and protections at Disallowing Religious Universities (DRUs) and their impact on sexual and gender minority (SGM) students and staff. The study highlights negative actions taken against SGM individuals by DRUs, such as barring admission, expulsion, and hostile environments. Rankin, Weber, Blumenfield, and Frazer (2010) determined that negative experiences (physical and mental abuse) for LGBTQ students still exist despite advancements in campus climate. LGBTQ students were likelier to describe a negative campus climate than their heterosexual peers (Brown, Clark, Gortmaker, & Robinson-Keilig, 2004; Gortmaker & Brown, 2006).          Holland et al. (2013) took a quantitative approach where nearly 2,000 college students were surveyed to learn their attitudes towards the LGBTQ population. Specifically, the study focused on how various demographics of students' perceptions changed based on the groups they belonged to. This study adapted and furthered the work of a previous study by LaMar and Kite (1998), which entailed a measurement known as the Components of Attitudes Toward Homosexuality Scale. The results of the Holland et al. (2013) study were that women, those with liberal Christian traditions or non-Christian faiths, LGBT community members, and upperclassmen had higher levels of tolerance for gay and lesbian individuals. “Lower levels of tolerance [were observed in] republicans, nonparty-affiliated students, African Americans, multiracial students, and College of Business or College of Education students” (p. 586). One study that bridges LGBTQ identity, campus climate, and the Campus Pride Index is Garvey et al. (2017). The work details the creation of the CPI to benchmark higher education institutions for inclusiveness.  This exploration of campus climate related to LGBTQ student experiences has demonstrated that there is not a positive outlook for this minority population. There were 94  described experiences reflecting physical and mental abuse and negative outcomes for LGBTQ students. As was mentioned, Student Life plays an important role in the campus climate. Student Life  The term Student Life (engagement) is inclusive of many different activities. Trowler (2010, p. 3) stated that “student engagement is concerned with the interaction between the time, effort and other relevant resources invested by both students and their institutions intended to optimize the student experience and enhance the learning outcomes and development of students.” This includes clubs, sports, organizations, service-learning, and other student engagement opportunities. However, it has also been noted that the presence of a resource does not mean it is effective. Fuller (2015) found that though students were aware of resources, they often chose to utilize their friends or organizations for support. Given the far-reaching impacts of campus climate, finding a sense of belonging is critical for students. Sense of Belonging Sense of belonging refers to the feeling of connectedness or the idea that someone’s presence matters to another (Rosenberg & McCullough, 1981). This comes by way of engagement with the community and relationship building. Student Life plays a key role in creating and maintaining a sense of belonging given these parameters. Suppose a sense of belonging does not exist. In that case, there is potential for mental health concerns (Hagerty, Williams, & Oe, 2002) as well as poor academic performance (Walton & Cohen, 2007) and attrition (Berger, 1997). Summing the importance of Student Life on sense of belonging as Strayhorn (2018) stated: … positive interpersonal, peer interactions increase students’ sense of belonging and sense of belonging leads to student success so those charged with increasing college 95  student success should think just as much about campus climate and policies governing social interactions as they do about predictive analytics, intrusive advising, curricular alignment, and early alert systems (p. 3). Strayhorn makes an important distinction between what leaders care about and what matters regarding a sense of belonging, Student Life, and student success. Strayhorn (2012) also found that students with racial minority identities were more likely to have negative experiences and less sense of belonging, resulting in lesser outcomes.  Strayhorn (2012, 2018) makes a connection between Student Life and sense of belonging being important. A review of campus climate research shows that the atmosphere is negative for LGBTQ students. With Student Life being a key player in the campus arena and having significant roots in sense of belonging, it is imperative that sense of belonging be considered for this study as well.  Sense of belonging literature thus far has demonstrated its importance in academic success, retention, and health effects. Tying MST and sense of belonging together is Keene (2020), who explained that no belonging due to stigmatization leads to negative health effects, such as suicide. Maintaining a sense of belonging can indeed serve as a buffer to these harmful effects (Backhaus et al., 2021; Gopalan, Linden-Carmichael, & Lanza, 2022). These findings also reenforce the work of Strayhorn (2012, 2018), who indicated that minority identity students report lower levels of belonging than their majority peers.  A 2016 study by Vaccaro and Newman was one of the first to explore the intersection of sense of belonging and the LGBTQ identity. Their findings are significant in that there are distinct differences in perceived belonging of majority and minority students. For example, majority (or privlidged in the study) students described belonging as being comfortable or fitting 96  in. Minoritized students said that having safety of their surroundings and respect from others were key in establishing a sense of belonging. This same sentiment was shared when considering clubs and organizations. Majority students described organizations as being “fun” whereas minoritized students sought authentic connections (p. 935). The discussion thus far has focused on belonging as it relates to student life opportunities. There is also a body of research on belonging in the residential setting.  Blackmon, O’Hara, and Viars (2020) studied microaggressions toward LGBTQ students in residential facilities and found that the “perception of being targeted … [was] a significant negative predictor of sense of belonging” (p. 53). Furthermore, they found that as this perception increased, sense of belonging decreased. Blackmon et al. (2020) also addressed the “value of lived experiences” (p. 53). The work of Sue (2017) is important to highlight as it ties lived experiences to identity in that “microaggressions are about experiential reality and about listening to the voices of the most oppressed, ignored, and silenced” (p. 171). Blackmon et al. (2020) connected sense of belonging to minority stress theory (Meyer, 1995) through the harmful effects that discrimination or microaggressions have on LGBTQ individuals. Housing & Residence Life  Student housing has been around since the 1600s (Martin, 2019). It is well known that students living in campus housing perform better academically than their off-campus peers (Bigano, 2008). This can be attributed to many factors, including the learning environment of the residence hall, proximity to classes, and social experiences attributed to that environment (Anderson, 2020). One body of literature that exists is the impact that student housing has on LGBTQ students specifically. 97   Kortegast (2017) explained that staff in those spaces significantly impacted LGBTQ experiences in housing facilities. “LGBT[Q] students’ perceptions of residence life staff affect their experiences within the residence halls” (p. 61). Speaking about the impact that main office housing staff had on their own experience was Wyatt (2021). Wyatt shared that they chose a school based on how inclusive it was rated toward LGBTQ students and, after outing themselves many times to housing staff, still found acceptance and support lacking.   Heasley (2021) explored the impact gender had on the residential living experience. It was found that gender was a factor in determining sense of community. Within this study, Heasley also found that the physical design of a residence hall impacted one’s sense of community. This ties directly into the present study as the CPI evaluates factors such as this and assigns a score in return.  Building on this, Wagner, Marine, and Nicolazzo (2018) explored the experiences of trans students in gender-inclusive housing. They found that gender-inclusive housing was appreciated, but other barriers still lessened the experience, such as oversight of processes and procedures by cis-identifying staff. Again, this ties nicely into the current study due to the CPI assigning scores based on the presence of a resource. As we see here, the presence of gender-inclusive housing does not mean a positive experience. Fuller (2015) found that LGBTQ students had “feelings of fear, discomfort, and unease when dealing with their peers” (para. 4). For example, some students in the study experienced homophobia when they were holding hands with their partner and “someone screamed ‘Fags!’ and threw a full sealed beer can at [them]” (para. 1).  Together, these studies demonstrate that though staff can work to create positive atmospheres, their influence and students themselves can still negatively impact LGBTQ student 98  experiences. This was seen with LGBTQ students describing that cis-identifying staff overseeing processes was still a barrier. In addition, Fuller (2015) also demonstrated that the student population is still a force that can negatively impact LGBTQ students (which also speaks to campus climate) through the use of slurs. This review of Housing & Residence Life literature is important for this study because of the critical role that housing facilities play in campus climate. Prior research has demonstrated the benefits of living in such spaces (Anderson, 2020), as well as the tremendous detriment that housing staff and other students (Fuller, 2015; Wagner, Marine, & Nicolazzo, 2018) can have on the LGBTQ student experience. Campus Pride Index Campus Pride History          As discussed earlier, the environment and support networks can drastically impact an individual’s ability to cope, transition, and integrate identity. It comes as no surprise then that campus climate can also affect student transition and success, especially for those from marginalized groups (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Furthermore, this impact is strengthened for LGBTQ students in identity development (Garvey & Rankin, 2015) and academic experiences (Gortmaker & Brown, 2006). Before 2007, “there [were] few tools available to assess the availability of campus LGBTQ-related resources or policies” (Garvey et al., 2017, p. 62). This need for a tool to identify such resources was the root cause for creating the Campus Pride Index.  For this study, the CPI is the campus climate instrument being utilized. This is because it is the primary campus climate inclusivity resource publicly available online. Furthermore, it has a significant national reach with institutions across the country in its catalog.  CPI Founding and Guiding Principles 99           Created in 2007, the CPI was a joint effort between LGBTQ advocates and researchers and the Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals (Garvey et al., 2017). When the CPI was founded, a set of primary goals guided the instrument. According to Campus Pride (2020), the goals were a) to create national LGBTQ benchmarking standards, b) to provide an instrument to measure campus inclusivity for LGBTQ individuals, c) to create a list of LGBTQ-friendly college campuses for prospective individuals, d) to support LGBTQ recruitment efforts, and e) to inform national LGBTQ policy and societal advancement. Further, the CPI measures eight factors on college campuses (Campus Pride, 2020). These factors are a) policy inclusion, b) support & institutional commitment, c) academic life, d) student life, e) housing and residence life, f) campus safety, g) counseling and health, and h) recruitment and selection. These eight factors are then used as overarching themes for several questions on the CPI instrument (see Appendix A). For each area, a campus authority with knowledge of the information completes the questionnaire and sends it back to Campus Pride for scoring.  CPI Implications          The Campus Pride Index has several implications. One such use of the CPI would be for LGBTQ student college recruitment. Squire and Mobley (2014) found that there is little research on LGBTQ recruitment, but there is a need to support students once they are on college campuses. The authors also believe there is a need for university administrators to understand the importance of college choice for LGBTQ students. Further, the CPI is an easy way to demonstrate the LGBTQ inclusivity of an institution. “The Campus Pride Index is an ideal instrument for administrators to use when preparing marketing and recruitment materials to indicate the steps that an institution is taking to improve the campus climate for LGBTQ 100  students” (Garvey et al., 2017, p. 66). Given the notion that the CPI can be a lucrative recruitment and marketing tool, it is important to consider students' lived experiences on such campuses.          Policy adjustment and LGBTQ student advocacy are major implications of using the CPI. Since policy and support are built into the CPI, they make it a natural area to benefit from CPI scoring. Garvey et al. (2017) stated, “inclusive policies also influence how LGBTQ students perceive and experience their campus’s climate. Campus administrators and policymakers have used the CPI to inform policy creation and revision to foster LGBTQ inclusion for [community members]” (p. 67). Similar ideology can be applied to supporting students through advocacy. Since the CPI can be seen as a comparative tool, benchmarking for best practices is also a possible outcome.  Conceptual and Theoretical Frameworks  Minority Stress Theory (MST) guided this study, including questions asked in the interview and data analysis. This theory was chosen for the study because of its relevance to the population and how the campus climate can impact an LGBTQ individual. A basic tenet of MST is that people with minority identities endure higher mental health concerns than their majority peers (Meyer, 1995, 2003). In addition, other researchers have added to the body of scholarship on minority stress, such as Silverschanz et al. (2008), who summarized MST to “[assert] that socially marginalized groups, including sexual minorities, can experience mental and physical health problems resulting from negative social environments created by stigma, prejudice, and discrimination” (p. 180). Given that LGBTQ students make up just 17% of college students (Postsecondary National Policy Institute, 2021), it was plausible to utilize MST for this study. 101   Meyer (1995) describes minority stress as a psychological detriment caused by the impact a minority identity has on the individual. He further explained that it is stress related to societal stigmatization, homophobia, and incidents of violence and discrimination. Brooks (1981) furthers the notion that societal norms and perceptions can significantly impact a minority individual through the internalization of such content into one’s psyche. When considering the LGBTQ community, Polihronakis et al. (2021) posit that “health disparities of sexual minority people can be partly attributed to heterosexism, which perpetuated interpersonal and institutional discrimination against individuals who do not adhere to society’s rigid standards of exclusively heterosexual attraction, behavior, and/or identity” (p. 202). Their study found that minority stress causes adverse effects on LGBTQ individuals (specifically bisexual men), such as sexual health concerns and substance use.   Meyer (1995, 2003) and Hatzenbuehler (2009) explored the interconnections of minority status with mental health. Fulginiti et al. (2020) further examined the impact minority status has on suicide. They found that “[s]exual minority stress [was associated] with both perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness in models predicting suicidal ideation and attempt. Moreover, minority stress had a direct effect on suicide attempt and an indirect effect on both [ideation and attempt]” (p. 601). Given the multiple impacts minority stress has on an LGBTQ individual, we must analyze the campus climate with which such populations may engage. Other researchers have explored the impacts of minority stress on LGBTQ populations. Hatzenbuehler (2009) established a framework that suggested that LGBTQ minorities are at a higher risk for psychological distress due to their stigmas and negative perceptions. Fulginiti et al. (2020) researched the relationship between suicide rates and minority stress and found that minority stress was an indicator in models which predicted suicide. 102  MST’s guidance on this study was unique attention to detail on how structural factors and lived experiences impact mental and physical health. Also, many MST studies included stress impact on subgroups (Meyer, 2003; Polihronakis et al., 2021; and Fulginiti et al., 2020), so this study sought to do the same.  Methods This study was a qualitative case study wherein semi-structured recorded interviews were used to gather data and later coded for major themes. These semi-structured interviews entailed a series of closed- and open-ended questions, with the opportunity for follow-up-up questions, such as inquiring about the why or how behind a comment (Adams, 2015). The research was conducted as a case study focusing on LGBTQ students at the institution. This research occurred within a single university setting, and all interviewed participants were affiliated with the institution. This creates a bounded unit and thus a case study (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Guided by MST, qualitative data was gathered to determine the impact such stress has on mental and physical health. Setting  The study occurred at a large, public, 4-year, research-intensive institution in the Midwest. It has over 30,000 students and participates in Division I athletics. The institution is also the state's flagship and is part of a system of universities. It is also one of the few institutions nationwide with professional programs in medicine (human and animal) and law. In addition, there are more than 600 clubs and organizations, and nearly 7,000 students live in campus housing.   103  Participants There are more than 30,000 students at the institution, with over 20,000 being undergraduate, 6,000 graduate, and 1,500 enrolled in professional programs. The institution is predominately White, with nearly 24,000 students identifying as White. Approximately 75% of students are in-state, and almost 90% are Pell-eligible. There were 16 participants in this study who represent several LGBTQ identities and class standing. See Table 1 for participant demographic information. Sampling Snowball (chain) sampling was the primary means of participant selection for this study, wherein key informants were identified to share study information with relevant or interested students (Mertens, 2020). For this research, two LGBTQ students disseminated study information to other students, information was disseminated through a listserv, and LGBTQ student organizations shared study materials internally. Participants were also asked to share study details with others who might be interested at the end of each interview. Relating this sampling method to MST, Meyer (1995) used snowball sampling. Data Collection Tools and Procedures Interviews were the primary data source for this study because it “is a powerful way to gain insight into educational and other important social issues through understanding the experience of the individuals whose lives reflect those issues” (Seidman, 2019, p. 13). One interview was conducted for each participant with a runtime of 60 – 90 minutes. MST guided the primary development of the interview protocol while the published CPI data served as a basis for questioning. To further ensure that MST guided the interview protocol, Pachankis (2014) was utilized to infuse theory tenets throughout. This was done through principles such as normalizing 104  mental health concerns due to minority stress, empowering LGBTQ students to communicate openly and assertively, validating LGBTQ students’ strengths, affirming identity and “rewarding expressions of sexuality,” and facilitating supportive relationships (pp. 8-9). To determine if there were differences between the CPI rating and lived experiences, participants were shown the score for both SL (5 out of 5) and HRL (4 out of 5), as well as the checklist of offerings that contributed to the overall rating. Data Analysis Interview notes and transcripts were coded using the QDA Miner software after each interview. This was done to ensure that key elements from participant interviews were not missed and to help inform the following interview (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016). Open coding, or finding value in all content and not ruling out interesting data, was the method used (Merriam & Tisdell). Codes were words or phrases that summed up salient or encompassing themes that arose throughout the transcripts and researcher notes (Saldaña, 2013). Using QDA Miner, these codes were merged, through analytical coding, into overlapping and major themes based on commonalities in meaning (Richards, 2015). The researcher also took notes on participants’ gestures, attitudes, and tones to supplement the themes yielded from the data in the form of nonverbal information (Denham & Onwuegbuzie, 2013). To understand the overall climate, a final coding occurred on all data to create a master list of major themes. Each of these major themes is representative of its own narrative and tells a story without influence from the rest of the dataset (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). With all major themes created in QDA Miner, data was exported in excel format. The researcher then utilized the interview transcripts and coding notes to tie participant quotes to the major themes. This was done to “support claims, illustrate ideas, illuminate experience, evoke emotion, and provoke response” (Sandelowski, 1994, p. 479). As 105  such, the most powerful and impactful quotes were selected from participants to showcase the themes in the findings. As is common in minority stress studies, subgroup coding occurred to explain how structural factors impact each group differently (Meyer, 2003). To do so, codes were analyzed across participant demographics to determine if specific themes were only relevant to one identity versus another. Researcher Positionality The researcher’s positionality is important to disclose for this study. They are biased in this area due to their ten years of experience in student affairs and housing. During this time, they developed a passion for creating socially just environments for students, faculty, and staff through advocacy for policy change and implementation or revision of resources. Later in their career, the researcher held a role emphasizing student sense of belonging and wellbeing. In this capacity, the researcher could secure resources across division and unit lines to best support students of all identities and backgrounds. This role also demonstrated to the researcher that the experiences and accessibility of resources for minority students at the institution are insufficient. Through a combination of passions and relevant work experience, the idea and direction of this study came to fruition. To combat this bias, the researcher utilized various methods to ensure data collection and findings were accurate. First, the results were compared to that of other scholars referenced earlier. Next, participants were asked if what was heard was accurate through paraphrasing. And finally, staff that are close to the topic were briefed on findings throughout the process to determine if anything was off-base. By combining these methods, the researcher’s bias was not impactful on the results or findings of this study.  106  Findings  Findings from this research are significant in that they demonstrate clear differences between CPI rating and student experiences, show high variances between reported and actual institutional commitment, express evident impacts on mental health, and invoke concern for current practices and procedures in both SL and HRL. Major themes which emerged from the data were mental health, rating variances, student experiences with identity and sense of belonging, lack of institutional support, and HRL staff. Findings will be reported by providing quotes to support each of the major themes and a brief display of how the major themes tie into each other. Mental Health  Mental health is a major theme in this study due to the extreme variances in experience and impact participants had related to mental health, and each participant discussed it in some capacity. There were several codes, discussed later, that were developed to create this master theme. It was noted after a few interviews that no participants had tied their college experiences or identity to physical health. This theme continued for the duration of all interviews, resulting in a major theme of mental health. Participants expressed a variety of impacts as well as what they deemed the factor(s) creating or causing that impact.  Positive or Neutral Impacts Mental Health. Many students described SL's impact on their mental health as being positive. This stemmed from involvement in clubs or organizations, attending events, and overall support from other students. One student described the impact on their mental health as, “having the [center] really helped with my depression.” Finding a sense of belonging within the center was beneficial for these students as it related to their mental health; however, all participants did not share this feeling. Most students in HRL spoke to either a 107  positive or neutral impact on their mental health. For those that experienced a positive impact, it was due to the people they were with, relating to a sense of belonging and community. One participant said, “I feel like it’s been pretty good pretty positive overall, it had a slight positive impact [on my mental health].”   Many participants described their experiences in SL and the corresponding effects of their identity as having no impact on their mental health. Students explained that this was because they did not frequent LGBTQ events or resources due to being busy or because they chose to spend their time elsewhere. Another factor was that students were particular in who they chose to surround themselves with, which created a neutral impact instead of a positive or negative. One student stated, “in regards to the queer community, it had very little impact on my mental or physical health, mostly because I’ve been able to make connections through which I suppose would help my mental health.” This reinforces the idea that a sense of belonging can impact mental health. Students that expressed negative impacts had a much different story to tell.  Negative Impact on Mental Health. When speaking about the inclusion of all identities within the LGBTQ spectrum, one student said, “[they] kind of [make] it seem like we really don’t matter, like they’re kind of looking at the L and the G and the B in LGBT and kind of ignoring us [trans students].” This student explained that they do not feel seen since there is no focus on the trans community. Another student explained a trauma response they endure when entering a certain building due to prior experiences there. They said: I have had times where I’ve been getting ready to walk into the building in the morning and realized, oh wait, my heart is racing, everything just feels really heavy right and there’s a real, I think it’s a trauma response. 108  This student explained that their experience was so negative that it is causing significant mental health impacts on an ongoing basis. Most students who were not affiliated with the HRL staff reported positive or neutral impacts on their mental health. However, nearly all participants that were also current or former employees of HRL reported both negative experiences and adverse effects on their mental health. For example, one student said, “working in [HRL] had a very negative impact on my mental health and that is why I left.” In addition, though it will be discussed later in the student experiences section, it is essential to note that one student employee described significant homophobic experiences while working in HRL. Rating Variances  Rating variances are considered a major theme for this study due to the extreme discrepancies in participant responses related to SL and HRL in some areas. When participants were shown the CPI rating for each area, they were asked to reflect on their experiences and share their feelings about that rating. Most students shared that there was some level of disagreement with the rating, though a few agreed with it, specifically in HRL. Interestingly, most of the negative responses for the HRL CPI score were from current and former HRL staff  SL Rating is Misleading. Most students felt that the rating for SL, which is a perfect score, was too high. This was due to several reasons, but among the top were that they would not describe their experience as being perfect, felt that the presence of a resource did not make it effective, and expressed overall disdain for SL. When shown the CPI rating, one participant immediately said, “Oh, that feels like bullshit.” Another said that the CPI “improperly gives the school a higher rating.” Others said it is “just a pattern of disappointment” and “it is kind of insulting to see that they are going to put out that high of a recommendation.” An example of 109  resources existing but not being helpful is the supposed presence of LGBTQ-specific career resources. The institution receives credit on the CPI for having it, but no participant could speak to what those resources were.  HRL Rating is Misleading. Participants that were also current or former staff had a negative stance on the CPI rating, citing that it was misleading or too high. An area HRL receives credit for in the CPI is that all staff are trained on LGBTQ issues. When reflecting on their training, one of the participants said, “the training we go through relating to LGBTQ experiences is quite brief.” The student also said the training was “maybe an hour in the afternoon” and that it “just describes more so what it means to be in the LGBT community and different aspects of that rather than like the problems they face in HRL or you know in their lives.” Though they were outliers in the data, some students agreed with the HRL score. Some HRL students found that their housing experiences generally matched the CPI rating. Considering that the rating matched their experience, one student said, “I feel like that’s definitely fair, I’d say that, generally, I agree with them for myself, individually.” The tone shifts to be more negative when considering the opinions of current and former HRL student staff. Student Experiences with Identity and Sense of Belonging  Student experiences are ubiquitous across the institutional setting. They are considered a major theme for this study because when considering clubs, organizations, events, programs, living locations, and general student experiences, participants generally had a positive purview of clubs and organizations. When they reflected on their experiences as a student removed from these spaces, they described a more negative atmosphere.   Clubs and Organizations. Nearly all participants that engaged in LGBTQ clubs and organizations explained that their support comes from those entities, not the institution. One 110  student explained that “it’s not really on [the university], it’s more on the students to make something [happen].” Another said, “I’ve been trying to look into whether or not there is an intersex club and whether or not we would need to create one, because I think that’s like a niche that ‘ought to have been filled by now.” Describing a sense of belonging, one student said clubs were “empowering in that sense to where I’m like, I know that it’s not just me out here, you know, there’s other people there.” Students generally found their time in LGBTQ clubs, events, or organizations positive. However, when they described their experiences as a general student, their tone shifted to be more negative.  General Student Experiences. Students explained instances of othering, self-censorship, and homophobia. When speaking about their identity and feeling othered, one participant said that “they [the institution] give us a small space in the basement to congregate.” Another explained the experiences of a peer where they were “put in the uncomfortable position of having to speak for the trans community at large, as you know, as if he could represent the whole trans community.”  Another student expressed self-censorship in that they felt the need to hide their identity because “it’s definitely more comfortable to put on that straight face than to maybe be my whole true self … I definitely leave my classes like I have a hidden identity.” Speaking of unsafe spaces, one student explained that they experienced “casual bits of homophobia” on campus. This was regarding attending parties with friends and being unsure how their identity would be perceived. Specifically, a concern shared was what would happen if other students became intoxicated. An interesting note is that when considering whether all identities within the LGBTQ spectrum were equally supported, there was a split between gay- and trans-identifying students. Gay students believed there was a focus on the gay identity, whereas trans students emphasized the umbrella term LGBTQ more than individual identities. 111  HRL Experiences. A majority of students that described a positive experience in HRL tied it to a sense of belonging they had. One student said, “I felt really comfortable, and they were all really accepting.  I would say my housing experience was very good, I’ve had minimal problems.” Another student explained that when they could not use the LGBTQ center due to the flooding, they could utilize public space in their dorm. One student shared, “I had a very safe environment and my dorm, although I can’t speak to other dorms at my dorm felt especially safe.” For non-staff, there were few instances of students describing negative HRL experiences, with most tied to a lack of belonging or roommate issues. One student explained that they had to code-switch with their roommate. They said, “whenever I was interacting with them [roommate], you know, I would deepen my voice.” The accessibility of resources was a negative talking point for students. For example, “[speaking of gender-neutral housing] the fact that it’s only in one dorm.” Another student shared that gender-neutral bathrooms are in the basements of dorms, so they have to go out of their way to use a facility. Lack of Institutional Support  The major theme, lack of institutional support, was by far the most negative conversation with all participants throughout the interview process. Due to students' extreme emotion and impact about the institution, whether senior leaders or support systems, the major theme, lack of institutional support, became increasingly clear. Key areas that participants tied to lacking institutional support included the identity centers restructuring and the performative nature of the institution and senior leaders regarding their words being supportive but actions saying otherwise. Important to note is that this theme was specific to SL.  Identity Center Restructuring. A sensitive and impactful topic throughout the interviews was the restructuring of the identity centers that occurred last year. In the restructure, 112  professional staff that oversaw each of the centers saw their positions disappear and be merged with other centers. For example, the institution opted to merge the LGBTQ center with the women’s center, which meant that one professional staff member oversaw both areas (before the restructure, each office had one coordinator). One participant was on an advisory board when the merge was being discussed and said, “the whole thing last year … where [senior leader] came in and was doing a big switch up with how things were run in the big restructure. I was never an incredible fan of it.” Another explained that senior leaders seem to be “just defending [their] position instead of actually like making progress.” Students explained that leadership pushed for one initiative when they (the students) were advocating for a different one.   Performative Nature of the Institution and Senior Leaders. The idea of institutional support being performative stemmed mainly from the discussion on the CPI rating for SL. Students explained that though the institution may have a perfect score on paper, the presence or perceived support of something does not make it true or effective. This was described in many ways, such as not listening to students when sharing concerns, educational opportunities, and general perceptions. Students felt that, in general, they could not rely on the word of senior leaders because there was a record of them saying one thing and doing another (e.g., identity center restructuring, working against students for protest). As mentioned above, many students expressed dissent in restructuring the identity offices, but the plan moved forward regardless of student opinion. For educational opportunities, the CPI gives the institution credit for offering education on trans identities; however, participants explained that though those opportunities exist, they are sponsored by student organizations and not the institution. One student explained that it seemed the institution was actively working against them as it related to organizing a student rally. They stated, “we held a rally against anti-trans legislation and tried to educate 113  people and they [the institution] took every opportunity they had to try and shut that down.” Another student summed up their experience by saying there is “a lot of lip service and not a lot of real support and engagement directly.” The consensus from students was that a majority of support from both the institution and senior leaders was performative.  HRL Staff  HRL staff became a major theme for this study because of their prominence in the general student responses and the different perspectives that current and former HRL staff brought to the study. In this area, there were more neutral and negative responses than positive ones. Important to note is that most neutral HRL staff comments were from general students, whereas most negative comments were from current and former HRL staff.  HRL Staff Interactions. HRL staff were described as being neutral because students generally did not know their stance on LGBTQ issues and needs, nor did they know if HRL staff could be a positive resource to them. When asked why a student was unsure of staff’s knowledge, they said, “the [housing staff] made no mention of, like, knowing or understanding [my identity].” As mentioned previously, students described that HRL staff make no overt encouragement or discouragement of the LGBTQ identity and instead seem neutral on the topic.   Nearly all negative HRL interactions were described by current and former HRL student staff. Most of these negative interactions were also tied to homophobia. For example, one participant said, “there was a fellow I worked under, and [they were] really happy to dead name1 any of the trans students that worked under [them].” Another student described some of their student staff peers as being “those who are either blatantly or more subtly homophobic.” No  1 “The name that a transgender person was given at birth and no longer uses upon transitioning” (Merriam-Webster, 2022). 114  general student described observations of homophobic staff; these experiences were reserved for current and former staff alone.    Discussion  Results from this study were as expected in many areas. Prior research such as that of Brown, Clark, Gortmaker, and Robinson-Keilig (2004) and Gortmaker and Brown (2006) found that LGBTQ students were more likely to describe negative campus experiences than their heterosexual peers. Rankin (2005) also shared this sentiment, who surveyed LGBTQ students and found that many reported negative campus experiences. Due to this, it was unsurprising that many students expressed negative thoughts, opinions, and concerns about Student Life. Also unsurprising was that many students opted to find support from their friends or organizations instead of utilizing campus resources (Fuller, 2015). Though students could not speak to the knowledge or training of staff, they were aware of gender-neutral housing, and many spoke about their comfortability in seeking out staff if they had concerns. Another surprising finding, which seems to go against MST (Meyer, 1995, 2003), was that no participant (explicitly) spoke about the impact their experiences in either Student Life or Housing & Residence Life had on their physical health. Instead, participants focused exclusively on their mental health. A major finding of this study is that the assigned Campus Pride Index scores do not reflect the lived experiences of LGBTQ students at the institution in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life. Mental Health  Mental health was the first major theme identified due to its significant prevalence throughout the transcripts, and its high degree of impact on the student experience and LGBTQ identity (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Meyer, 1995, 2003; Silverschanz et al., 2008). Students spoke about how their LGBTQ identity impacted their mental health and how various structures at the 115  institution either supported or damaged their mental health. These findings make sense for this study because the student experience can significantly impact an individual (Strayhorn, 2012, 2018). We saw many examples from SL where negative interactions related to their identities caused a determinantal impact on their mental health (Blackmon et al., 2020; Hatzenbuehler, 2009). One of the most telling examples of this was the participant that described a trauma response when entering a specific building following negative experiences there. Though they only recognized a mental health response, physical detriments were also described.   The mental health major theme speaks directly to determining whether minority stress impacts a student’s mental and physical health or not. There were several examples from SL and HRL where different forces caused minority stress and how students described that impact on their mental health. A leading way students combat this impact is by finding a community and developing a sense of belonging (Hagerty, Williams, & Oe, 2002; Fuller, 2015). Important to note is that all participants explicitly spoke about minority stress impacts on their mental health, whereas most did not discuss physical implications. Those who shared physical health impacts did so in a way that described the effect without realizing it was a physical detriment.  Viewing the mental health findings through an MST lens is even more concerning. For example, MST tells us that minority stress can be a predictor of suicide (Fulginiti et al., 2020). Furthermore, as Fulginiti et al. found, “thwarted belongingness” is also detrimental to mental health (p. 601). This is supported by Strayhorn (2012, 2018), who spoke about the importance a sense of belonging has for students and how seriously senior leaders need to consider it. Rating Variances  The major theme of rating variances was fundamental and discussed throughout the study. Students disagreed with the ratings for SL and, depending on staff status in HRL, either 116  agreed or disagreed (Kortegast, 2017; Wyatt, 2021, housing staff influence experience). For SL, students shared significant dissent for the perfect score that the CPI gave the institution. This was attributed to students being unaware of listed resources, saying the rating was superficial, and thinking the institution received credit where it should not. When we consider that there has been discussion of using CPI as a recruitment tool, this is concerning (Garvey et al., 2017). The varying negative experiences were similar to those found in Bardhoshi et al. (2018), such as censorship and advocacy. In HRL, the general student agreed with the ratings, whereas current and former student staff disagreed. This was again because they felt the institution was receiving credit for things it does not do or does not do well, such as training and education.  This theme and findings make sense for this research because they are justified by prior issues at the institution. As was discussed, there are broad diversity and inclusion issues at the institution, and many students spoke about these concerns. Given these overarching issues, it is unsurprising that students disagreed with the institution's rating in the Campus Pride Index. When considering whether students described a difference between their lived experiences and the assigned CPI, it was evident that there exist substantial areas for improvement. The CPI gives credit for something existing and not whether or not it is utilized or even known about (Fuller, 2015, described students being aware of resources, but choosing not to use them). For example, no student could discuss what LGBTQ-specific career resources exist at the institution. When thinking about HRL, students felt that having gender-neutral housing in one dorm made it inaccessible and having gender-neutral bathrooms in the basements of facilities. This finding aligns with prior research from Heasley (2021), who found that the physical designs of dorms impact LGBTQ student experiences. 117  MST sheds important light on the CPI and describes differences in student experiences. As was explained, LGBTQ individuals need systems that celebrate their uniqueness, empower and validate their identities and experiences, and foster supportive relationships (Pachankis, 2014). Students showed that the ratings do not reflect their experiences and therefore do not create such a system. Bardhoshi et al. (2018) explored student experiences and campus climate. One key finding of this was the importance of student advocacy. It is unsurprising, then, that students are advocating for change in both the institution's support systems and within the CPI rating. Student Experiences with Identity and Sense of Belonging  The third major theme of this study was student experiences with identity and sense of belonging because of how ubiquitous they are throughout the institution, CPI agreement, and mental health (Hagerty, Williams, & Oe, 2002; Rankin, Weber, Blumenfield, & Frazer, 2010; Strayhorn, 2012, 2018; Trowler, 2010). There were mixed reviews in both SL and HRL, mainly depending on the context in which the student was speaking. For example, students described positive SL experiences when they thought about clubs and organizations or the community they found (Fuller, 2015; Strayhorn, 2012, 2018; Vaccaro & Newman, 2016). However, when they thought about their experiences outside of these settings, the tone shifted to be more negative, with one student describing the need to hide their identity (Bardhoshi et al., 2018). In HRL, similar concerns existed with a student code-switching with their roommate or others finding issues with accessibility of resources. The distinction between gay- and trans-identifying students and their perception of LGBTQ identity support (Meyer, 1995, 2003, subgroups). Gay students believed there was more support for the gay identity, whereas trans students felt there to be more support for the umbrella LGBTQ term. 118   Throughout the study, students described issues they have in areas of diversity and inclusion in both SL and HRL. For students to find positivity in their friends and community, describing a negative atmosphere outside those spaces is entirely understandable. Thus, these findings make sense for the study because of the current campus climate at the institution. Framing these findings and experiences through sense of belonging literature and MST helps further describe the theme's importance and applicability.  Sense of belonging means that an individual matters to others (Rosenberg & McCullough, 1981). Students that describe othering, code-switching, voices not being heard (Blackmon et al., 2020; Sue, 2017), and having to go out of their way for a resource are not being shown that they matter. These findings are also congruent with MST application. Brooks (1981) explained that societal norms and perceptions could impact minority individuals through internalizing such content into one’s psyche. Given that students described instances that relate to norms and perceptions, it is important to give minority stress special consideration. Important to note here is the subgroup analysis of what support exists for individual identities within the LGBTQ spectrum. This was the only area where there was a large discrepancy between LGBTQ subgroups. It is common in MST research to discuss, at least in part, various impacts on subgroups (Meyer 1995, 2003). Lack of Institutional Support  Institutional support was identified as the fourth major theme for this study because of the strong emotions students had when discussing it. This theme only applied to the area of SL as no participants expressed overwhelming concerns with senior leadership of HRL. Throughout the study, students described support from the institution and SL-affiliated senior leaders as 119  performative. They cited the identity centers' restructuring, the CPI giving credit for resources when they should not, and the feeling that the institution is actively working against them.   This theme makes sense for the study because of the turmoil that LGBTQ students have faced at the institution. For example, though many students advocated against the identity center restructuring, it still happened and their voices were ignored (Sue, 2017). The resulting protests became nationally known after trending on Twitter. Within the last month, there was also an anti-trans legislation protest, and students explained that securing permission to have a microphone was more difficult than it should have been.   As stated by Strayhorn (2018), it is time that institutions and senior leaders seriously consider a sense of belonging as a critical metric for student success. Students made it clear that their sense of belonging was not considered when they advocated against pending changes (Sue, 2017), and the institution still moved forward with them. This also applies to the spaces they utilize (Heasley, 2021); the institution continually delaying repair of the LGBTQ center’s floor (in the basement) and placing gender-neutral bathrooms in inaccessible locations does not contribute to a sense of belonging. With how negatively students described the performative nature of leaders and the institution, it is not surprising that there is a lack of empowerment and validation in SL. From MST, we know that these feelings must be present to relieve minority stress (Pachankis, 2014).  HRL Staff  HRL staff became the final major theme of the study because of how prevalent they were in participant discussion and impactful they can be on the student experience and minority stress. The general student found their experiences with HRL staff neutral, meaning they were not positively or negatively impacted. Literature also tells us about the importance of HRL staff in 120  the LGBTQ experience (Kortegast, 2017; Wyatt, 2021). They cited not knowing whether or not staff knew LGBTQ issues, nor if they could be a resource. When considering the stance of current and former HRL staff members, the experience shifted to be more negative. Some left the department due to significant negative impacts on mental health, or others experienced high levels of homophobia from peers or supervisors (Berger, 1997).  These results, though surprising in some regards, make sense for this study. If a staff member does not overtly express support for identity, then a minority student would not know whether or not that person is a resource (Kortegast, 2017; Wyatt, 2021). This also aligns with a staff member's earlier comment that LGBTQ training was subpar. It also makes sense that a staff member interacting with others that are homophobic would lead to a negative experience and stance on HRL (Blackmon et al., 2020; Rankin, 2005; Rankin et al., 2011).  The outlook is not good when considering these impacts on the overall experience and sense of belonging. Berger (1997) explained that students who do not have a sense of belonging are likelier to leave the institution. This is precisely what was seen in at least one staff member who left because of the environment. Then, White and Cones (1999) explain the importance of peers in a sense of belonging. Staff describing their peers as homophobic is extremely problematic and does not add to a sense of belonging. Pachankis (2014) explained that a key tenet of decreasing minority stress is facilitating supportive relationships. This cannot be done in a homophobic environment.  Implications  This study has the potential for significant implications in higher education settings. As discussed earlier, this study filled a gap in determining whether there were differences in the assigned CPI rating and the LGBTQ student lived experience. Furthermore, there was also no 121  evidence of how MST applied to these same individuals. Results of this study address these gaps by demonstrating the clear need for improvements in several areas; the CPI instrument, institutional support, HRL selection and training, sense of belonging, and minority stress. These results are most applicable to the target audience of the study – LGBTQ students, institutional staff, senior leaders, and Campus Pride.  LGBTQ Students  Considering the importance of college choice for LGBTQ students (Casey, 2014; National Center for Education Statistics, 2012; Red Ventures, 2021), having campus climate information is important to aid in that decision. The CPI plays a critical role in that it is an online and easily accessible catalog in which students can seek the overall inclusivity rating of the institution or look deeper at subcategories, such as Student Life and Housing & Residential Life as this study did. The first implication of this research relevant to current and future LGBTQ students is that they should not put a lot of faith in the rating. This study demonstrated that the ratings in Student Life and Housing & Residence Life do not accurately describe LGBTQ students’ lived experiences. The CPI ratings do serve as a baseline for what does and does not exist, but students cannot rely on the presence of resources alone. Instead, students need to actively seek out the resources described in the CPI. Another implication for LGBTQ students is to use the CPI as a source of advocacy. Since the CPI is public access, LGBTQ students can use the ratings as benchmarks for similar institutions (size, geographic location, religious affiliation). An example of this might look like students advocating for more all-gender bathrooms because every other institution in the state has them, and so on.  Institutional Staff 122   For the discussion of implications, institutional staff is defined as personnel who are not considered senior leaders, but do have decision-making authority. Examples of these staff would be entry-level supervisors, coordinators, or assistant directors in both Student Life and Housing & Residence Life. The primary area where staff were discussed in the study was in HRL. There was discussion of a transphobic supervisor who intentionally dead named trans students. The first implication for HRL is to create a more robust hiring system to ensure these individuals are not hired in the first place. Addressing staff with discriminatory views must be at the forefront of HRL’s action plan as several scholars have spoken about the adverse impacts such bias has on LGBTQ (or marginalized) individuals’ health (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Meyer, 1995, 2003) and belonging (Blackmon et al., 2020; Strayhorn, 2012, 2018). An initial step is utilizing the institution’s LGBTQ center, which offers training on LGBTQ issues. This would be a great way to improve the training staff receive. Though it may be a several-hour course, the outcome would provide staff with a better knowledge of LGBTQ issues. This is also a training that can be required across all housing staff instead of exclusively to those in-hall. The LGBTQ center can also be referenced as a topic expert in changing the student and professional staff interview questions. For student staff, implementing group interviews with a focus on diversity activities would be one way to identify bias amongst candidates. Another common theme in HRL was unknowledgeable or ineffective staff in the residence halls. When considering HRL, a theme that emerged was that staff are not adequately trained in LGBTQ needs, or if they are, they do not demonstrate it. Students shared that they were unsure if HRL staff were a resource because they never showed concern for the LGBTQ community. Student staff members explained that they felt their LGBTQ training was subpar as well. It 123  would benefit HRL to spend more time educating staff on LGBTQ needs and providing opportunities or resources for how to better demonstrate the knowledge learned. Senior Leaders  For discussion of implications, senior leaders are defined as staff who are department, division, or institutional directors. A common talking point amongst participants was the performative nature of the institutional and SL-affiliated senior leaders. Students felt that through recent actions that the support they were receiving was performative and only to make SL look good on paper. Students are advocating for more accessible resources, equitably furnished spaces (Heasley, 2021), for senior leaders to listen to them and their needs (Sue, 2017) and stop working against them and their initiatives. This study and its findings demonstrate clear unhappiness with senior leaders and their actions (or lack thereof) in supporting LGBTQ students. It is apparent that LGBTQ students are voicing concerns, so leaders need to simply listen and act. There is no grace for inactivity as students are speaking out about these experiences and expecting change. Campus Pride Given that the CPI is one of the few instruments to measure campus inclusivity towards LGBTQ students, and that it has been suggested as a recruitment tool (Garvey et al., 2017), it was important to review differences in the CPI rating and lived experiences. This study yielded results that contradicted the reported scores of the CPI and demonstrated dissatisfaction in resources, training and education, support, and overall experiences for LGBTQ students. To improve satisfaction the CPI must revise its campus climate instrument immediately. Until it does so, the best outcome is that the tool is utilized solely to gain a base level of knowledge on the resources available at an institution. This study showed that the presence of a resource does not mean it is effective or accessible. 124   Overwhelmingly, there was an expressed need to revisit how the CPI measures the inclusivity of an institution toward LGBTQ individuals. Students disagreed with the perfect score that SL has for various reasons, one of which was that the presence of a resource does not mean that it is effective or accessible. The CPI needs to revise its instrument to enhance the checklist method to also include accessibility, awareness, and student perception of each item. If the Index is designed to provide insight to LGBTQ students (among others), then they should have a voice in resource reporting. Including student voices in the process, such as through focus groups or interviews, would create student buy-in as there would be authentic experiences tied to the feedback (Vaccaro & Newman, 2016). Including student opinions would also work to mitigate the impacts of minority stress through implementing a sense of belonging. Bringing students into the process reinforces that they matter (Vaccaro & Newman, 2016), applies their unique experiences, and gives them a platform to be heard (Sue, 2017). Beyond student buy-in is the accuracy and frequency of the information reported to the CPI for review. The current model the CPI uses of having a single campus authority report the items back to the organization is not effective or sustainable. For example, changes on the campus are not immediately reflected on the CPI site, which yields misinformation. The administrators of the CPI should shift to a more immersive model wherein CPI staff do the information gathering and proposed student interviews themselves. Of course, they can work with a designated campus authority, but the appropriate department directors would make better knowledge bases for their individual areas than would a single person completing the questionnaire for the entire campus. The Index can begin with outreach to department directors for what is on the instrument, and then work with the campus authority to identify a student sample to participate in focus groups or interviews. Doing so would yield much richer qualitative data than a simple checklist ever could.   125  This study and associated findings also create opportunities for future research. Only two of the eight factors contributing to the CPI rating were studied. Additionally, this study only focused on LGBTQ students, which leaves additional research on the impacts on faculty and staff. Broader opportunities for future research also exist at different types of institutions (size, religious affiliation, and geographic location). Conclusion  The gap in literature and practice that this research aimed to fill was whether there were differences between the assigned CPI rating of an institution and the lived experiences of LGBTQ students while being conducted through a minority stress lens. The findings of this study were that five major themes of mental health, rating variances, student experiences, institutional support, and HRL staff could help tell the stories of how LGBTQ students are impacted by minority stress and existing structures at the institution. This qualitative study sheds light on the importance of a sense of belonging for students to combat minority stress, as well as the clear issues in both practice and support from the institution. It also demonstrated the need for a more robust recruitment and training process for HRL. Finally, the research also demonstrated that there were indeed differences between assigned CPI ratings for SL and HRL and the LGBTQ lived experiences. However, this is not the institution taking advantage of the Index. Instead, the Index is not built in a way to consider all of the nuances of the LGBTQ student experience. Unless the Index undergoes significant structural and procedural changes to analyze these nuances better, it will only serve as a baseline level of knowledge for college choice.  The results of this research are also significant, with implications for practice and future research. Prior researchers have called for the CPI to be a recruitment tool for institutions and 126  LGBTQ students alike. Findings illustrate that the CPI instrument does not consider lived experiences and that a resource existing does not mean it is accessible or helpful. This research also demonstrated the need for institutions to critically review the impacts minority stress has on its students and shift focus to creating and maintaining a sense of belonging through recognition of marginalized student experiences, listening to and acting on the feedback shared, and making it clear that the individual matters. With the multitude of negative experiences described and the consistent failure to support LGBTQ students, senior leaders must move beyond listening tours and take action immediately.     127  Acknowledgments  This study would not have been possible without the support and effort of several University of Missouri faculty members and fellow EdD program cohort-mates. Thank you to Drs. Marjorie Dorimé-Williams and Brad Curs for agreeing to be co-chairs throughout the dissertation process, as well as for ongoing support and guidance. Of course, a special thank you to Drs. Michael Williams and Jennifer Fellabaum-Toston for their knowledge and expertise as committee members.  I would be remiss to disregard the overwhelming support provided by the EdD cohort throughout the dissertation process. Heidi Jorgenson, Brittany Fatoma, Robin Clay, and Andrea Simmons, collectively known as the Dream Team, thank you. The countless words of encouragement and support you have provided were extremely helpful and comforting.   Lastly, a sincere acknowledgment to the 16 participants in this research study. It would not have been successful without their honesty and vulnerability as they told their stories. I am grateful to these students as they overcame barriers to tell their stories, as well as proud of them for their commitment to improving the experiences of other LGBTQ students at the institution. Declaration of Interest The researcher does have an interest in this research and its findings. Having ten years of experience in both Student Life and Housing & Residence Life has provided the researcher with a unique point of view as both a researcher and expatriate of student affairs. Furthermore, the researcher has worked throughout their professional student affairs career to advocate for institutional change that bolsters and creates a socially just environment for students, faculty, and staff.  128  It is appropriate to note that this research study was partly funded by an academic unit within the institution under study. The funding was approved as part of a research grant opportunity open to all researching students. This funding was used for participant compensation. 129  References Adams, W. (2015).

A key takeaway from this dissertation is that leaders need to do more than talk. A true leader can hear the concerns of their constituents and act on them to create positive change. I heard far too much throughout my research interviews that students were tired of performative leadership. They found their senior leaders, especially in Student Life, speak for saving face instead of creating meaningful, positive change. Some leaders took this further and actively defended poor decision-making instead of supporting students. As I move forward in my professional career, I always want to keep this in mind; how can I ensure that I am not just speaking and acting on my words instead. I never want to be in a position that the senior leaders at the institution under study are in, where many students are actively speaking against or negatively of them due to their inaction on important issues. Through this dissertation, I also learned the importance of developing a sense of belonging.  A strong theme in the data was that a sense of belonging could make or break a college experience for LGBTQ students, as most attributed their positive experiences to the community they had found or built. As a leader and in practice, I want to infuse the culture of creating a sense of belonging into my work. Before I departed from student affairs, I focused heavily on developing a sense of belonging amongst students and staff and attempted to bolster a better relationship with staff. As I navigate a new role, I have already begun applying these tactics as I have already committed to fostering a sense of belonging to a much larger workforce. Instead of applying this concept to student retention, I can capitalize on it in employee wellbeing, mental health, productivity, and retention. I am excited that the idea of a workplace sense of belonging is on the 142  rise because it is something that I am so passionate about. I am thrilled that my participants were able to find their respective forms of a sense of belonging despite the challenging circumstances they were placed in by the institution.  The EdD program has also significantly impacted me as a practitioner. I have learned to appreciate the program's focus on practice and implementation. The coursework excelled where my master’s program lacked – the practitioner piece. Throughout my master’s program, I felt something was missing because we learned a lot of theory but were never taught how to apply it. Many of the EdD assignments and class discussions asked us to reflect on and apply the knowledge we learned in the classroom to our professional roles. Through this process, I could actively increase my efficiency and effectiveness as a student affairs professional.   Through the EdD program, I also gained lifelong friends. The program was intentional in having the cohort focus on a group project each semester. This approach allowed me to work with different people from various professions every step of the program. I did find a solid group, later named the Dream Team, for the latter half of the coursework. We held each other accountable and provided support throughout the pandemic, classes, and now the dissertation process. I was also able to secure my first publication with these same folks. As I navigated this dissertation, I received support from the team throughout the process, especially as I began my research. In addition, some of my teammates connected me with many students who either participated in the research or shared my information with their areas of influence. In short, this program taught me the true value of camaraderie and creating a support system of friends across many areas, both within and outside the university.  The EdD program taught me the final important piece of knowledge was how to work with stakeholders, the different frames of organizations, and policy analysis. Of course, I applied these 143  tenets to my role in student affairs; however, I have since changed career paths and now work in human resources and talent development within the government. Having prior experience in these areas has been influential in finding success in my new role. For example, I recently received funding for a new initiative and worked to secure it through stakeholder buy-in. With the different aspects of government, I have often found myself wondering why something is the way it is. Looking at decisions and rules through the different frames has broadened my perception and understanding to get on board more easily or deepen my ability to help with a cause. I have also applied these tactics in conversations with folks from different agencies to see things from their point of view and understand their concerns with initiatives my department might be considering. The notion of policy analysis has become increasingly important in my new role. I am working with drafted, pending, and new policies frequently, and they have the potential to impact thousands to millions of people. Having a background in policy analysis from the EdD program has given me a new point of reference in this area, and I am grateful for the knowledge. Influence on Scholarship  This dissertation has impacted me as a scholar by pushing me to reach new horizons as a researcher and individual. I was nervous through most of the program about my ability to complete the dissertation based on horror stories from others with EdDs or PhDs. However, I learned through the structure of this program and the dissertation in practice that I can reach goals through guidance, mentorship, and grace.   An unexpected outcome of this dissertation on my scholarship is that it cemented my passion for doing social justice research. Through my research, I have found that many changes do not occur simply through students advocating for themselves. Instead, their voices are shut out or ignored by senior leaders. Instead, I have found that it is necessary to find means to amplify 144  those voices to a larger audience, perhaps by doing a dissertation or seeking publication on the topic. Doing so makes it more difficult for senior leaders to ignore peer-reviewed scholarship with a national platform. As well, I found a passion for sense of belonging scholarship.  Through this dissertation in practice and my professional work, I have found that sense of belonging impacts more than just student retention. There seemed to be such a focus on student retention while I worked in student affairs that other aspects of sense of belonging were pushed to the back burner. For example, I have found that not only does a sense of belonging impact retention, but it also impacts mental health, productivity, and other metrics. I have been able to directly apply this newfound knowledge to my career to try and bolster the workforce. I have also found that research is not nearly as difficult as it used to be for me.  My master’s program was a bit challenging in the area of scholarly research. However, through this program, I have found new and better ways to conduct scholarly research to find best practices, review current literature, and synthesize content. I attribute this to a few different things, with the first being more accessibility at a larger university. My master’s degree is from a mid-size institution, and I do not believe they had access to the same resources as a large research university. Next, intentional partnerships were made throughout this program, such as having librarians come to our class to talk us through what they can assist with and how to utilize them as a resource. Finally, one of the most helpful things I have found is the ability to request access to books, articles, or journals to which I usually would not have access. All these things combined have made me a better researcher, and the intentional assistance and thought put into the idea of research in this program was critical.  This program and the dissertation in practice also influenced the type of research I enjoy conducting. Throughout my academic career, I have always enjoyed working with numbers but 145  found that the stories I wanted to tell related to a sense of belonging needed the substance that only qualitative research could convey. Through the multiple revisions of this dissertation, I also learned that I naturally sway toward writing quantitatively. Moving forward, I think I will research in a mixed-methods approach to combine my passion for numbers with the need for qualitative content. Before this program, I never considered blending the two forms of research, but I have a newfound appreciation for it. The ability to convey information at a glance through quantitative data is something I have always valued. Through this dissertation, I have enjoyed explaining major themes and sharing narratives of individual stories to share their truth, and what reality looks like for them.   The last significant influence that both the EdD program and this dissertation have had on my scholarship (and a bit of practice, too) is the importance of humor and lightheartedness in academia. I find that sometimes academia and the university setting are a bit too strict and rigid. There is always a bottom line, political pressure, angry parents, and so on, which leaves little room for someone’s passion for the field to shine. For this reason, I experienced burnout working in student affairs but still found the EdD program and this dissertation to be a reprieve from those influences. This idea of lightheartedness was instilled during program orientation through jokes and team building, which continued (heavily) during summer one coursework. I cannot speak to the other institutions in the cohort. Still, I feel that our faculty who teach the EdD coursework intentionally infused their personalities and charisma into their pedagogy. More often than not, I looked forward to the three-hour evening classes because of the instructor and the engaging content. I could have sought an EdD from many institutions, but I do not believe I would have had the same experience as I did with this program. The intentionality behind the faculty, the coursework, and my cohort made the experience worthwhile. 146  References Adams, W. (2015). Conducting semi-structured interviews. In J. Wholly, H.

The video portion of the interview will be saved until the study's conclusion, though it will not be utilized. It will only be needed should there be an issue with the audio file. Interviews files will be stored in a password-protected folder on a password-protected device which only the primary researcher will have access. All participants will receive a pseudonym after the interview and throughout the research and discussion process. Only the primary investigator will have access to the original names of the participants.            This protocol was developed using the Campus Pride Index and tenets of minority stress theory (Pachankis, 2014). Pachankis outlines several tenets of stress theory which are incorporated into the following protocol.  Student Life 1. What can you tell me about your experience at [institution name] as an LGBTQ student? 2. LGBTQ & Ally Student Organization. What can you tell me about LGBTQ student organizations at [institution name]?  a. How would you describe their support of the LGBTQ identity? b. To what degree do they empower or validate LGBTQ experiences? 3. Social Activities, Education, and Career Advancement. What can you tell me about how [institution name] engages and supports the LGBTQ community? a. What kind of social events exist? i. Do they facilitate supportive relationships? 161  b. Do you feel all identities within the LGBTQ community are equally supported and empowered? c. Are you aware of any career advancement resources specific to LGBTQ identities? 4. *Share CPI rating*, How do you feel about that rating and your experiences with Student Life at [institution name]? 5. How would you describe the impact that Student Life at [institution name] has on your mental and physical health? Housing & Residence Life 6. What can you tell me about your housing experience at [institution name]? 7. Do you feel that university housing supports your identity? a. What can you tell me about the staff’s knowledge of LGBTQ issues? b. Do you find that the housing staff validates and/or affirms your identity and experiences? 8. *Share CPI rating*, How do you feel about that rating and your experiences with Housing & Residence Life at [institution name]? 9. How would you describe the impact that Housing & Residence Life at [institution mame] has on your mental and physical health?   162  VITA The researcher does have an interest in this research and its findings. Having ten years of experience in both Student Life and Housing & Residence Life has provided the researcher with a unique point of view as both a researcher and expatriate of student affairs. Furthermore, the researcher has worked throughout their professional student affairs career to advocate for institutional change that bolsters and creates a socially just environment for students, faculty, and staff.

    "abstract": "[EMBARGOED UNTIL 8/1/2023] The Campus Pride Index (CPI) evaluates institutions' inclusivity relative to LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff in eight categories. This study targets two of them, Student Life (SL) and Housing and Residence Life (HRL), and considers the experiences of LGBTQ students. The research infused minority stress theory throughout the interview protocol to determine how each area affects an LGBTQ student's mental and physical health. The major findings of this study were that though a sense of belonging did exist, it was due to the relationships built amongst fellow LGBTQ students and not the institution itself. Furthermore, students felt CPI scores were misleading and that minority stress impacted student mental health in various ways. This research is relevant to college-seeking students, current enrollees, senior administrators, and Campus Pride. Implications of this study are far-reaching in that research data disputes published inclusivity scores in the CPI and demonstrate significant areas where this institution is failing its LGBTQ students.Includes bibliographical references",
