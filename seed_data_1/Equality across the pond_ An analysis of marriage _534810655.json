To establish how two prominentwestern regions (i.e., the US and the UK) compared to one another in terms of LGBTQ+ rights,two LGBTQ+ activist organizations in each country were examined. Within the UK, Stonewalland the LGBT Foundation serve as examples, and within the US the National Lesbian and GayJournalists Association (NLGJA)  and the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NLGCC)serve as examples. Examinations of the means of each movement as well as the movement'sinitiatives were conducted and analyzed in relation to their nation’s societal and legislativeprogress. Since the organizations that have emerged since the LGBTQ+ movement in the US andUK do not all display identical characteristics, the examples used here should not be seen asnecessarily representative, but rather as examples of how social activism may be correlated toLGBTQ+ rights and quality of life. With this, it should be noted that the outcome may yielddifferent results when applied to other LGBTQ+ activist organizations. Furthermore, thisdiscussion should be seen as an exploration and possibly even a point for further investigation.Though this comparison was limited to two western countries and with this, cannot claim to berepresentative of the broad and varied social movement landscape throughout the world.However, some of the findings may serve as points of departure for future research.The root of this dilemma spurs from human rights being challenged due to society’sresponse to the LGBTQ+ community opposing the status-quo and traditional norms of society.This connects directly to the public perception, religious influence and polarization factors thatwill be studied. Marriage equality should not be a dilemma. Unfortunately in the US and UK it ismainly a political dilemma; but is also a moral, ethical, and legal controversy. The purpose ofSantiago 4this research is to compare and contrast LGBTQ+ organizations' effect on the marriage equalityinitiatives taken within the UK to the initiatives taken within the US. I will examine differencesin legislation, court rulings, religiosity, and norms. The final objective of this research is to drawconclusions on how the LGBTQ+ social movement not only brought the LGBTQ+ communitytogether, but also played a major role in both the US’ and UK’s progress in obtaining marriageequality.Santiago 5Literature ReviewUniversal Marriage EqualityTwenty-nine countries worldwide, including the prominent Western democracies of theUnited States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) have legalized same-sex marriage. TheNetherlands was the first country to legalize same-sex marriage in 2001, yet today in 2022same-sex marriage still remains outlawed in numerous countries throughout the world and theexpansion of LGBTQ+ rights has remained a global controversy. For far too long individuals inregions throughout the world have had to face discrimination as well as suffer through violentattacks due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. In several instances, simply the mereperception of homosexuality or a transgender identity puts an individual’s safety at risk. TheUnited Nations has initiatives set forth to document these human rights violations and has forover two decades now. Today, United Nations organizations, including the Office of the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP), have placed a much higher focus on issues regarding sexual orientation andgender identity. Although there are several violations in relation to gender identity or sexualorientation that are not addressed, the major human rights concerns and the emerging responsesto these concerns are adressed. International organizations have also issued resolutions in supportof LGBTQ+ rights, but human rights groups continue to claim that these organizations havelimited ability to enforce their policies. These unrecognized concerns must be dealt with in amanner that protects both the rights and the safety of the LGBTQ+ community.Violence and DiscriminationLGBTQ+ individuals from all around the globe are often faced with physical attacks,rape, arbitrary detention, the denial of rights to assembly, torture, and discrimination inSantiago 6employment, health and education (Lee & Ostergard, 2017). These attacks are a form ofgender-based violence, often motivated by a strong desire to combat those seen as defyingsocieties traditional gender norms. Aside from the spontaneous outbreaks of violence and otherunforeseeable attacks in public settings, individuals that are perceived as LGBTQ+ are oftentargets of organized abuse by such groups including religious extremists, paramilitary groups,neo-Nazis, and extreme nationalists. To many in society LGBTQ+ individuals of all ages areseen to be transgressing unstated social norms and with this, face a much higher risk of familyand/or community violence. Lesbian and transgender women are at an even higher risk due togender inequality and power relations within society (Lee & Ostergard, 2017). Violence againstLGBTQ+ individuals is often absurdly vicious compared to many other bias-driven controversiesand such acts of discrimination should be outlawed. There are several countries with ongoingefforts to eradicate LGBTQ+ violence, but until all gender/sexual orientation-based violence iseliminated in every region throughout the world, the fight for equality will be ongoing.Legalized NationsToday same-sex marriage is still deemed illegal and/or immoral in numerous regionsaround the world, but there are also several countries that have either legalized or have beenmoving toward legalization. Currently, there are only 29 countries where same-sex marriage islegal; these countries are, as stated by the Human Rights Campaign: Argentina, Australia,Austria, Brazil, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France,Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand,Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United Statesof America and Uruguay (2020). Although it is a step in the right direction, this informationshows that in the majority of countries throughout the world, same-sex marriage remains illegal.Santiago 7Numerous countries have recently legalized same-sex marriage in 2019, such as Austria,Ecuador, and Taiwan. In Austria, the Constitutional Court of Austria ruled on December 4, 2017that the denial of marriage equality was discriminatory, thus legalizing same-sex marriage was agiven and began on January 1, 2019. Also in 2017, the Taiwan Constitutional Court ruled thatmarriage between same-sex couples could not be illegal and gave parliament two years to enactlegislation that would legalize same-sex marriage. So, beginning on May 24, 2019 same-sexmarriage is legal in Taiwan. This made Taiwan the first Asian country to enact marriage equalityand presumably not the last. Finally, as stated in the article by the Human Rights Campaign,Ecuador legalized same-sex marriage after their States Constitutional Court found on June 12,2019 that the ban of same-sex marriage was simply and utterly unconstitutional. This then led tomarriage equality taking full effect in Ecuador on July 8, 2019 (2020).In the latter part of 2020, numerous countries were on track to legalize same-sexmarriage. The countries mentioned in the article by the Human Rights Campaign that are ontrack to legalize include Chile, Czech Republic, Switzerland, the Philippines, and Thailand(2020). However, only one country legalized same-sex marriage in 2020; this country beingCosta Rica. In November 2018, Costa Rica’s Supreme Court ruled in support of the historicJanuary 2018 advisory opinion of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that statedmarriage equality was necessary for Costa Rica due to their obligations under the AmericanConvention on Human Rights. The push by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2018,led to Costa Rica’s supreme court ruling which stated that the ban on same-sex marriage wasunconstitutional and must be nullified. So, beginning on May 26, 2020, same-sex marriage waslegalized in Costa Rica, which made Costa Rica the first country in Central America to legalizesame-sex marriage. Costa Rica’s compliance paved the way for other countries involved in theSantiago 8Inter-American Court of Human Rights to follow suit because this instance demonstrated that acountry must follow through with their commitments, whether it was on a controversial issue ornot. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights is an independent judicial institution of theOrganization of American States, and it includes over twenty different signatory countries forwhich it is pushing for marriage equality. An article by the Child's Rights International Network,discusses that within these countries the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has proven to bean effective leader for positive change (2018). Costa Rica is a prime example of the positivechange that the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has brought about, and continues to fightfor in regions around the globe.The process of legalization was different depending on the region, but no population helda unanimous stance on the legalization of same-sex marriage. There were twenty differentcountries that legalized same-sex marriage nationally through legislation. Out of these twentycountries, Australia and Ireland legalized same-sex marriage through legislation only afternation-wide votes (2020). Seven countries have legalized same-sex marriage nationally throughcourt decisions Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, South Africa, Taiwanand the United States of America. Two countries, South Africa and Taiwan, enacted legislationlegalizing same-sex marriage after courts mandated them to do so. Renowned theorists,Finnemore and Sikkink, theorize that there are three stages of the life cycle of a norm: normemergence, norm cascade, and norm internalization. In the second stage, the norm cascade stage,Finnemore and Sikkink argue that norms are adopted in response to international pressure.Legislatures do this to enhance their domestic legitimacy, for the purpose of conformity, andsimply their own esteem needs (Finnemore & Sikkink, 1998). Furthermore, the argument thatmarriage equality is in the norm cascade phase during this period seems fair to say. This isSantiago 9because it is the law of the land in some regions, and it is not the law of the land in all regions,but it is well on its way. With this being said, it is still very unsafe to be a part of the LGBTQ+community. To make matters worse, even where same-sex marriage is legal, individuals are stillbeing discriminated against. Thus, pushing individuals to continue fighting for societal LGBTQ+acceptance with the goal to one day make it universal.Similar to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the European Court of Justice(ECJ) serves as a prestigious court in the European Union. In 2018, the ECJ determined that allEU countries were required to recognize the same-sex marriages of EU and non-EU citizens forpurposes of immigration, regardless of whether same-sex marriage is legal in those countries. Inrecognition of this decision, the Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria was the first to affirmthat the country would recognize such same-sex marriages in accordance with the ECJ’sregulations. The ECJ is a leading actor in the fight for marriage equality in Europe, as well asbeing a prominent contributing actor in the fight for universal marriage equality.Civil InitiativesTo further assist with the transition to legalizing same-sex marriage and ensure the safetyof LGBTQ+ individuals, several United Nations member states have enacted training programsfor law enforcement personal to prepare them for bias-motivated violence against LGBTQ+individuals and to assist them in recognizing, processing and reacting to reports of hate crimes(Delucio, Avellar, Harkness, Goodman, Bettergarcia, & Israel, 2017). In some countries, such asSpain, they have specific prosecutors to investigate, as well as bring hate crime cases to trial.Similarly, South Africa appointed a national task team for hate crime against the LGBTQ+community. Other states, such as Brazil or Germany, have used the Yogyakarta Principles,(ternational principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity), to help guide policySantiago 10procedures that deal with hate crimes and discrimination (ARC International, 2016). There arealso several examples of public campaigns that can, in some cases, gain state-wide support, thatare designed to address hate crimes. A prime example of this is Brazil; the Brazilian governmenthas supported a public education campaign that is run under the slogan “Brazil withoutHomophobia'' (de la Dehesa, 2010). Similar initiatives, often led by civil society, have beenlaunched in countries throughout regions around the world. Examples of initiatives ineducational institutions that counter LGBTQ+ hate crimes and violence include, teacher-trainingprograms, “safe spaces'' for LGBTQ+ youth in schools, and several different awarenesscampaigns. The Boys and Girls Clubs Association of Hong Kong, China offers counseling inschools and youth centers (Khor, Tang, & Kamano, 2020). In Ireland, they show ananti-homophobia video that has been shown to almost half a million people online alone (Brent,2012). In the United States, there are several gay-straight alliances or clubs, which areestablished in more than 4,000 universities and high schools (Leins, 2019). These initiatives arejust the beginning in the fight for universal LGBTQ+ rights.Global ActorsNational human rights institutions also hold an important role in ensuring marriageequality. An example of this is in 2011 when the Kenya Human Rights Commission producedthe report, “The Outlawed Amongst Us: A Study of the LGBTQ+ Community’s Search forEquality and Non-Discrimination in Kenya.” Individuals put a lot of focus on this report and theconclusions that were drawn from it changed societal perspectives. The Asia Pacific Forum ofNational Human Rights Institutions has also facilitated dialogue among member institutions,with positive contributions from national institutions in the Republic of Korea and Thailand(Asian Pacific Forum, 2020). Additionally, the New Zealand Human Rights Commissionrecently concluded a two-year consultation to identify human rights concerns of transgenderSantiago 11individuals. Finally, acknowledging that the protection of LGBTQ+ rights is crucial to theprogression of society, the Government of Norway recently published a plan of action intendedto mobilize eight Government departments to enact a series of measures to assist in ensuringLGBTQ+ rights (Kenix, 2008). These institutions, along with several others, have played a majorrole in the legalizing of same-sex marriages worldwide.Illegalization and HateEven with countless organizations fighting for marriage equality, including theInter-American Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice as well as severalcountries in the international community already that have achieved marriage equality, there arestill sixty-eight countries that retain laws used to criminalize individuals simply on the basis ofgender identity or sexual orientation. These laws, often referred to “sodomy laws,” are oftenancient creations from colonial era legislation (American Civil Liberties Union, 2020). Theselaws prohibit either certain types of sexual activity or, more specifically, sexual activity betweenpersons of the same-sex. In some instances, the wording that legislators use is vague. A coupleexamples of these phrases are, “crimes against the order of nature” or “crimes against morality”(American Civil Liberties Union, 2020). The main aspect that makes all of these laws the same isthat they are used to discriminate and prosecute individuals due to their gender identity orsexuality. In some severe instances, an individual can face the death penalty due to their genderidentity or sexuality. The banning of a consensual relationship, homosexual or not, violates anindividual’s rights to privacy and to non-discrimination, thus constituting a violation tointernational human rights law.United Nations special procedures mandate holders have noted the connection betweencriminalization and homophobic hate crimes and overall community violence (American CivilSantiago 12Liberties Union, 2020). The United Nations Special Rapporteur on health noted that sanctionedpunishment by states has reinforced existing prejudices, and legitimized community violence, aswell as police brutality directed at certain individuals (United Nations Human Rights, 2020).Also, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions noted that criminalization increasessocial stigmatization which in turn makes more individuals vulnerable to violence and humanrights abuses, such as death threats and are prominent in a climate of impunity. Since early 2000laws that criminalize homosexuality have been gradually revoked in regions around the globe,such as Bosnia, Cape Verde, Nepal, Nicaragua, Panama and the United States. In some cases, thecourts have overturned the laws that were enacted to deprive LGBTQ+ individuals of theirfreedoms, such as in Nauru and Principe. In others, revoking the laws resulted directly fromsome form of legislative process. Nonetheless, revoking these discriminatory laws is a step in theright direction.The LGBTQ+ Social MovementSocial movement research tends to be constituted as an interdisciplinary field of study,but Donatella della Porta & Mario Diani aim at presenting social movements through the lensesof political science by summarizing political science's most noteworthy contributions to thestudy of social movements. Diani and della Porta focus on broad research traditions that can betraced back to the social science’s founding fathers. Diani and della Porta argue that withcontemporary mainstream social movement studies being developed predominantly within USacademia tend to be rooted in liberal pluralism and therefore follow the theories of JamesMadison (2015). They then state that the political science view of social movements tends toview them as an expression of collective power interacting with other coordinated powers, suchas capitalism, state, counter movements, or the plurality of civil society groups. However, theySantiago 13discuss several other views such as the Marxist view, Weberians view, K. Polanyi’s view, and A.de Tocqueville’s view. In the Marxist view, social movements are a fight response to capitalism,envisioning an alternative social arrangement to be built from grassroots activism (Diani & dellaPorta, 2015). To the Weberians, movements are shaped by institutionalized power in the form ofthe modern state; they provide tools of collective expression to those not included in the formaldecision making structure. Followers of K. Polanyi view social movements as a regulatoryreaction to capitalist expansion and focus on democratically based regulation. On the other hand,participation researchers following A. de Tocqueville tend to view social movements as thecollective expression of individual political action which reflects unequal distribution ofresources within society. According to Diani and della Porta, the organizations that reflect theambivalence of modern democratic society represent and form various social movements whichcan serve countless purposes (2015). The mission and motivation for each social movement mayvary but all of which tend to connect trace back to inequality.The LGBTQ+ movement is a social movement that promotes equal rights andrepresentation for the LGBTQ+ community. The first known western LGBTQ+ activistorganizations were not formed until the early 20th century, but since then multiple have risenfrom the shadows. These organizations may focus on liberation, or as more commonly seentoday, equality, which is demonstrated in today’s world by the ongoing fight for universalsame-sex marriage rights. Earlier LGBTQ+ activist organizations seemed to have placed a muchhigher focus on self-acceptance and self-worth. A prime example of a liberation focusedmovement is the homophile movement of the 1950s. During this 1950s movement, prominentorganizations and publications were openly supporting and representing sexual minorities. Themove away from liberation focused movements was due to the LGBTQ+ movementSantiago 14advancement which led to a change in goals as well. LGBTQ+ rights organizations tend to varywidely on their mission so there is not one leading organization, but rather several organizationsof all different sizes, fighting for equality. Although there is not a leading or central organizationthat represents the entire LGBTQ+ community, there are several LGBTQ+ rights organizationsthat are active on a global scale. LGBTQ+ movements organized in today’s world are made up ofpolitical activism such as lobbying, street marches, social groups, media, art, and research(Morris, 2022). LGBTQ+ organizations are resilient and will keep fighting until LGBTQ+ rightsare respected around the globe.ConclusionMy comparative case studies of the four organizations within the LGBTQ+ movementwill use the factors examined to construct a framework through which I can compare andcontrast differing success outcomes between the four LGBTQ+ organizations. These factors areas follows: public perception, political polarization, and religious affiliation. This undergraduatethesis seeks to shine light on the LGBTQ+ social movement’s road to success as well as analyzehow the UK and the US’ LGBTQ+ organizations differ from one another. I will examine theirdifferences by reviewing the organization's effects on the three facets being studied: publicperception, political polarization, and religious affiliation. Each organization's actions may notdirectly correlate to legislation change, rather it is the changes in public perception, politicalpolarization, and religious affiliation that these organizations brought about that led to thechanges in legislation. It is important to note that it is the factors being studied that directlycorrelate to changes in legislation. As shifts in legislation, particularly on controversial topics, donot occur without some form of social upheaval; which is where the LGBTQ+ movement cameinto play for same-sex marriage rights.Santiago 15Chapter 1 - United KingdomIndividuals around the globe seem to see Europe as the pinnacle of a modern utopia.They have strong job security, a modernized economy, and a more progressive healthcare systemthan that of many other developed nations; which is likely what individuals find so appealing.Despite Europe's strengths, countries within the UK still suffer from almost all of the same issuesthat most developed nations undergo. These include, but are not limited to, unemployment, debt,and healthcare complications. Although Europe has had to experience the same challenges asother developed nations, the UK as a whole has had significant success when it comes to theinclusion of the LGBTQ+ community. The two organizations examined in the US to assessLGBTQ+ rights within the country: Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation, are both well-knownfor fighting for change in UK legislation within the LGBTQ+ sphere. By examining these twoorganizations, there is a sight at how the LGBTQ+ movement and social movements in general,have impacted both public opinion and policy. It is important to consistently and thoroughlystudy shifts in policy and public opinion for members of the LGBTQ+ community because therehave been constant shifts within society; which is essentially due to changes in societal norms.Santiago 16Marriage Equality in the United Kingdom (UK)Currently, same-sex marriage is legal in all parts of the United Kingdom. Since marriageis a devolved legislative matter, different parts of the UK legalized same-sex marriage atdifferent times. It has been recognized and performed in England and Wales since March 2014,in Scotland since December 2014, and in Northern Ireland since January 2020. However, it tookroughly five centuries to make such progress within the UK.In 1533, the Buggery Act came into effect and it was the first ever English law tospecifically outlaw anal sex. The text of the act described \"buggery\" as a \"detestable andabominable Vice,\" punishable by death whether committed with \"mankind or beast\" (25 HenVIII C.6).  Buggery eventually ceased to be a capital crime in 1861, when the Offenses Againstthe Person Act 1861 downgraded the punishment to life imprisonment in England and Wales (24& 25 Vict c 100). Scotland then followed suit in 1889 and lessened the severity of the charges forsuch crimes. In 1885, the Criminal Law Amendment Act came into law. The act's main purposewas to protect girls from sexual exploitation by raising the age of consent to 16, but anotherprovision in the act criminalized \"gross indecency,\" which in practice extended existing lawsagainst \"buggery\" to criminalize all sex acts between men (48 & 49 Vict. c 69).In 1957, the Wolfenden committee published a report that was based on three years oftestimony from police, psychiatrists, and gay men themselves. All but one of the committee's 15members, drawn from the world of politics, law, medicine and academia, agreed that homosexualacts between consenting men over the age of legal majority should not be a legal issue. In 1967,the Sexual Offences Act stipulated that private sex acts between consenting men over the age of21 would no longer be a criminal offense in England and Wales (1967 c. 60), although Scotlanddid not follow suit until 1980 and Northern Ireland until 1982. Despite cross-party support forSantiago 17the Act, Members of Parliament (MPs) were not quick to accept homosexuality as somethingthat is legitimate. \"Even those supporting decriminalization called homosexuality 'a disability'and 'a great weight of shame’” (Huffington Post, 2017). By the early 1970s, gay rightsorganizations began to appear both locally and nationally (Lesbian and Gay News mediaArchive, 2017). In 1988, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced an amendment to theLocal Government Act, Section 28, which banned state schools from teaching or promoting the\"acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.” The infamous Section 28caused widespread outrage and was the catalyst for a massive surge in LGBTQ+ activism,including the formation of LGBTQ+ rights group Stonewall UK.Section 28 of the Local Government Act was a piece of legislation that banned thepromotion of homosexuality by schools and councils throughout the UK, and led to a totalsuppression of LGBTQ+ identities across schools nationwide. Section 28 was repealed inScottish law in 2000, and from English, Welsh and Northern Irish law in 2003. In 2004, the CivilPartnership Act allowed same-sex couples to enter into same-sex unions with the same rights asmarried couples. Then in 2014, the Marriage (same-sex couples) Act 2013, which recognizedsame-sex marriages, entered into law in England and Wales. Legislation to allow same-sexmarriage in Scotland was then passed by the Scottish Parliament in February 2014 and tookeffect on December 16, 2014. The first same-sex marriage ceremonies for same-sex couplespreviously in civil partnerships occurred on the same day. The first same-sex marriageceremonies for couples not in civil partnerships occurred on December 31st, 2014. In 2017, TheAlan Turing Law received royal assent, which is an amendment to a clause in The Policing andCrime Act 2017, as it was modeled after the codebreaker’s royal pardon years earlier, “pardonedall historic instances of criminal convictions of gross indecency against men'' (2017 c. 3). It onlySantiago 18applies to convictions in England and Wales. In 2020, same-sex marriage was legalized inNorthern Ireland. Following the enactment of the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act in2019, same-sex marriage became legally recognized in Northern Ireland in January 2020 (2019c.22) . However, couples who are already in a civil partnership are still not able to convert it to amarriage (Coulter, 2020).Public Perceptions and Status QuoIn recent years, opinion polls have shown general support for same-sex marriage amongcitizens of the UK which is a drastic shift from their traditonal standpoint. Attitudes towardshomosexuality amongst the British public have become more tolerant over time: according to theBritish Social Attitudes Survey, in 1983 approximately 50% to 70% of respondents of the threemajor political parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat) regarded homosexuality as\"always wrong\" or \"mostly wrong\" and in 1993 opposition to homosexuality was reported tohave slightly increased amongst all parties. However, by 2003 attitudes had become moretolerant, with 25% to 50% of respondents regarding homosexuality as always or mostly wrongand by 2013, only around 20% to 35% of respondents in each party felt the same way (BSA,2015). Liberal Democrat respondents tended to be less likely to regard homosexuality as wrongthan Labour or Conservative respondents across each survey. A later poll by BBC Radio inMarch 2014 found that 68% of respondents supported same-sex marriage and 26% opposed it.The research also found that younger people were more likely to support same-sex marriage,with 80% support from 18 to 34-year-olds, compared with 44% of over-65s. 75% of womenwere in favor, compared with 61% of men (2014). A 2018 Pew Research Center poll concludedthat between April and August 2017, 77% of Britons reported to support same-sex marriage,20% were opposed and 3% didn't know or just refused to answer. When divided by religion, 83%Santiago 19of non-practicing Christians, 82% of religiously unaffiliated people and 63% of church-attendingChristians supported same-sex marriage. In June 2018, a YouGov opinion poll found that 80% ofBritish people supported the introduction of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, with thatnumber decreasing among Northern Irish respondents. Finally, in a more recent poll from 2019,Eurobarometer found that 85% of Britons thought same-sex marriage should be allowedthroughout Europe, whilst 12% were against.Political Association/PolarizationParty identification is a differential predictor of attitudes towards the LGBTQ+community, and the impact of party identification is both modest and variable over time(Bettinsoli, Suppes, & Napier, 2020). The issue engendered considerable opposition within theConservative Party when it was put on the political agenda. In 2012, many Conservative MPseither opposed the reform or simply did not regard it as a priority, arguing that the economy wasstill in trouble and major public service and welfare reforms were still underway. Surveys from2012 Conservative MPs and peers showed considerable opposition to the plans and support fordelaying the plans and concentrating on other priorities (ComRes, 2012). More than 100Conservative MPs expressed opposition to the plans in correspondence with constituents. In theextra-parliamentary party, a survey of constituency chairpersons found that 71% wanted theproposals to be abandoned, while nearly half said their local party had lost members over theissue (Hennessy, 2012). A 2012 membership survey by the Conservativehome website found thatlarge majorities of those polled disagreed that the gay marriage reform was necessary (64%),agreed that it could split the party (71%) and believed their leader had underestimated thestrength of feeling on the issue (78%) (Grice, 2012). It is clear that there was widespreadopposition to the reforms within both the parliamentary and extra-parliamentary party, and theSantiago 20coalition government needed to rely on the votes of Labour MPs to get the measure through theHouse of Commons.Religious InfluenceNorthern Ireland has been socially and religiously conservative since its foundation in1921; the polity still contains strong religious sentiment among Protestants and Catholics (Hayes& McKinnon 2018). It provides an example of a confessional political system and maintainsheavy religious derived support bases for its political parties. Although same-sex marriage isnow legal in Northern Ireland, the Quakers are the only mainstream church that allows same-sexmarriages.The Church of England has more than 16,000 churches in which different-sex couplescan marry, but its churches are not available as venues for the blessing or solemnization ofsame-sex marriage, leaving same-sex couples at a significant disadvantage with regards to theirability to access a religious ceremony in connection with their marriage. While England hasembraced the notion of equal marriage, the Church of England maintains its traditional doctrineon marriage. Its pastoral guidance holds firm to the belief that marriage consists in a permanentand lifelong union between one man and one woman. In consequence, it prohibits its clergy fromentering into a same-sex marriage themselves, and from solemnizing or offering public servicesof prayer and dedication in respect of such marriages (Smith, 2019).As stated in the report by the Standing Doctrinal Commison of the Church of Wales,similarly to England, same-sex marriages may not be solemnized by the Church in Wales. Suchmarriages are also at variance with the church’s doctrine of marriage which states that marriageis a lifelong and faithful union between a man and a woman. The church, however, has torecognize the legality of same-sex marriages, but it is also clear that there is a dissonanceSantiago 21between its opinion and the State’s opinion. If the governing body decides in the future that thechurch should solemnize same-sex marriages and the bishops propose a Canon to that effect, theLord Chancellor must then bring measures to change the law to make that possible (2014).As stated by the BBC news article (2017) The Scottish Episcopal Church voted to allowgay couples to marry in church, making it the first major Christian church in the UK to allowsame-sex marriages. The vote to amend canon law on marriage, removing the stipulation that itis between a man and a woman, was carried by the Synod in Edinburgh. This meant that gayChristians from any Anglican Church can now ask to be married in a Scottish Episcopal Church.The article by the Church of Scotland states that in May 2018, the General Assembly voted 345by 170 to instruct the Legal Questions Committee of the Church of Scotland to preparelegislation which, if approved, would allow ministers and deacons to apply for a licence toconduct same-sex marriages if they wished to do so. The Committee will report to the GeneralAssembly of 2020 and it will be for commissioners to decide whether to begin the process ofconsidering whether this law should be adjusted.Stonewall & LGBT FoundationThe information previously discussed gives the reader the information needed in order tobe able to fully comprehend the UK’s stance on LGBTQ+ rights throughout history which iscrucial in understanding the development on LGBTQ+ rights, specifically ones that pertain tomarriage equality. The topics discussed political association, religion, and publicperception/status quo are all important components of societal change as well as legislative. Forthe purpose of this study, I have chosen to focus on two renowned organizations within the UK:Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation. I will be examining these organizations' impact on the UKas a whole and more specifically focusing on what actions they took to bring about change. TheSantiago 22rationale behind choosing these two organizations is that they are prominent throughout the UKand have been leading actors in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the UK. In the following casestudies, I will focus on exploring these organizations’ impact on the UK as well as how theyaffected the overall quality of life for members of the LGBTQ+ communities within the UK.Santiago 23Stonewall“Campaigning as part of a global movement since 1989, we have helped createtransformative change in the lives of LGBTQ+ people across communities in the UK.”(Stonewall, 2021). This is the slogan that the courageous Stonewall organization has displayedon their website’s homepage. Founded in May of 1989, roughly one year after Section 28 cameabout, the Stonewall organization has been fighting for LGBTQ+ rights throughout the UK andultimately LGBTQ+ rights worldwide. The founders of Stonewall were a small group of activistswho had been active in the fight against Section 28 from the start. They knew communitiesthroughout the UK needed a professional campaigning organization who would fight for theirrights in politics, in the media, in the courts, and ultimately everywhere they learn, work, prayand exist (Stonewall, 2021).The Stonewall organization has come a long way from just being a small group ofactivists fighting against Section 28. It’s founders, Ian McKellen, Lisa Power, and MichaelCashman have fought tirelessly to eliminate anti-LGBTQ+ legislation with the hope of one dayeliminating LGBTQ+ discrimination worldwide. Today, Stonewall’s initiatives have led toalmost every child in the UK now being taught about LGBTQ+ individuals' lives, families andrelationships as part of their national curriculum. When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherintroduced an amendment to Section 28 that banned state schools from teaching or advocatingfor the acceptance of homosexuality, Stonewall’s founding activists were among the first tospeak out about the unjustness of Section 28 and played a leading role in its eradication. This isjust one of the many steps Stonewall took to alter public perceptions on homosexuality.Prior to starting the Stonewall organization, the founders were all known throughout theLGBTQ+ community but they had no intentions of starting an organization for the LGBTQ+movement. McKellen has held several prominent positions in society and is well-known for hisSantiago 24acting awards. However, it was not until 1988 that he publicly came out as a gay man during aBBC Radio 3 discussion Section 28 of the Local Government Act. This was just the beginning ofthe mark that McKellen would have on the LGBTQ+ community. As for Power, she came out asLesbian in the 1970s in a time when homosexuality was practically shunned in British societyand became an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights soon after. She had worked for numerous LGBTQ+campaigns and programs prior to being a co-founder for Stonewall. Finally, Cashman was anactor, politician, and activist. He was always open about his sexuality which at the time, put himin direct danger. During this period, police were not very welcoming to the LGBTQ+ communitywhich led to increased rates of LGBTQ+ violence. The Stonewall organization may not havebeen planned, but these three activists noticed the need for collective action and took it uponthemselves to start Stonewall.Stonewall did not stop the fight for LGBTQ+ after combating Section 28, rather theycontinue to strive to make the UK a country that accepts LGBTQ+ relationships as well as onewhere there are equal rights to love. This fight is still an ongoing battle today in 2022. Forindividuals in the LGBTQ+ community who want equal rights to marry or to have children, theStonewall organization has remained a part of every major battle for LGBTQ+ rights since 1989,including: an equal age of consent for gay and bi men, the end of Section 28 in Scotland,England, and Wales, same-sex couples gaining ability to adopt children, LGBTQ+ individualsgaining the right to serve openly in the Armed Forces, protection from discrimination at theworkplace, the right for same-sex couples to have civil partnerships, the right for LGBTQ+couples to be legally recognized as parents, the right for same-sex couples to get married,LGBTQ+ inclusive teaching in the national curriculum, etc. They have truly stood their groundthroughout the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. Whether this was pushing for large-scale change orSantiago 25working within local communities to make change, Stonewall has always done their part. Theywork with thousands of people every year throughout all communities, whether in a village orcity, school or university, etc. Ultimately any place where LGBTQ+ individuals should be able tothrive the Stonewall organization will be there to help individuals in the LGBTQ+ reach theirgoals.Since the early 2000’s, Stonewall has worked with thousands of both the UK’s and theworld’s leading employers through their Diversity Champions program and WorkplaceEmpowerment program. This in turn helped get legislation passed that would eliminateLGBTQ+ discrimination in the workplace. An example of this is the Equality Act 2010 whichprotects lesbian, gay, bi and trans people from direct discrimination, indirect discrimination,harassment and victimization in the workplace (2010 c 15). Later in 2004, Stonewall startedworking with tens of thousands of teachers and schools through their School and CollegeChampions program to put the freedom, equity and potential of LGBTQ+ youth at the center ofthe education system. The organization now works with local councils to support LGBTQ+children and young people within their communities with their Children and Young People’sServices Champions program. With this being said, Stonewall has been a leading actor in theimplementation LGBTQ+ acceptance in schools throughout the UK. Stonewall has also createdcountless safe spaces for the LGBTQ+ community to exercise and enjoy themselves while doingit. The Rainbow Laces campaign is a useful example here, it was started in 2013 and more than amillion individuals from the LGBTQ+ community and allies laced up to make sports moreinviting to LGBTQ+ individuals. The Rainbow Laces campaign has led to sport bodies from thePremier League to community cricket clubs working directly with Stonewall to make LGBTQ+inclusion a reality on their playing fields.Santiago 26Stonewall have had an extensive impact through their programs and campaigns in theLGBTQ+ community. Their organization consists of proud LGBTQ+ individuals who arethemselves, who feel valued and included and able to thrive, and who advocate for the rights ofothers in the LGBTQ+ community (Stonewall, 2021). This is crucial to the development of theyouth in the LGBTQ+ community because most LGBTQ+ children do not have a positiveLGBTQ+ role model. In every community in the UK and around the world, LGBTQ+ people arestill being abused, thrown out of their homes, bullied in schools and workplaces, and so on. Theinstitutions that should protect LGBTQ+ members, governments, communities, faith institutionsand often families too stand silent, or also actively act against the LGBTQ+ community. Frommisogyny to classism, racism to ableism, LGBTQ+ people of color, LGBTQ+ women, LGBTQ+individuals living in poverty, and many more, are not given equal opportunity and are forced tolive in the shadows. No matter the challenge, Stonewall has been at the forefront of the LGBTQ+movement and if it wasn't for their collective push, these laws would not have changed. Worldhistory has taught us that it takes collective action to motivate a government to nullifydiscriminatory laws, and this is exactly what Stonewall has helped achieve by bringingindividuals together for the fight for equal rights. In conclusion, the Stonewall organization willcontinue to stand with, and fight for, the freedom, equity and potential of all LGBTQ+individuals worldwide until the world that they imagine becomes the world that we live in(Stonewall, 2021).Santiago 27LGBT FoundationThe LGBT Foundation is a national charity that deliveres support, advice and informationservices to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities. Established in 1975, theLGBT Foundation’s main purpose is to support the needs of the diverse range of individuals whoidentify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. They strive for equality and have faith in a fairand equal society in the future; a society where all the individuals in the LGBQT+ communitycan finally achieve their full potential. The LGBT Foundation stated that the hashtag“EqualityWins'' practically summarizes their mission. With this being said, the organization'scentral focus is equality and they aim to be there for the LGBTQ+ community wheneverLGBTQ+ discrimination is present. They are a nationally recognized charity mainly based in thecommunities of Greater Manchester and provide a wide range of evidence-based and costeffective services. Each year, they serve over 40,000 people, achieving an average 98%satisfaction rating as well as providing information to thousands of individuals virtually (LGBTFoundation, 2021). As a result, they serve more LGBT people than any other charity of theirkind in the UK. Throughout all of their work, they have supported LGBT people to increase theirskills, knowledge and self-confidence, in order to improve and maintain their health andwellbeing. They also work in partnership with other organizations to build strong, cohesive andinfluential LGBT communities. On account of their commitment to bring LGBT individualstogether, they are changing LGBT lives for the better and securing a safe, equal and healthyfuture for all LGBT people.To help guide the LGBT Foundation in their work and deal with the opportunities as wellas the challenges that they may face moving forward, they have four key values that they mustalways adhere to. The first is passion; they are passionate about what they do. Their passion forSantiago 28their cause is what drives them to assist others. As staff, volunteers, and trustees they dedicatetheir skills, experience and time to improving the lives of the LGBTQ+ community. They strivedaily to ensure that everyone who comes into contact with the LGBT Foundation or any of itsmembers has an excellent experience. The second is empowerment; they are committed toenabling individuals to flourish by creating time and space for the LGBTQ+ community toachieve their full potential. The organization believes that enabling others to feel empoweredresults in improved resilience and better outcomes. Empowering their members and the peoplethat they serve amplifies what they can achieve collectively. The third value that underpinseverything they do is integrity. They are committed to being professional and honest and  holdthemselves accountable to the highest ethical and performance standards. Behavingprofessionally and honestly builds on the excellent reputation that their charity has attained. It istheir integrity that motivates them to deliver professional governance, services, insight andbusiness support daily to the communities that they serve. Finally, their fourth value is respect.They are respectful of not only themselves, others too, appreciating differences and trustingindividuals to do what is right. They believe that respecting one another’s work creates asupportive environment in which to receive services, work and volunteer.At the LGBT Foundation they have had a passionate history of grassroots activism andcommunity involvement since 1975. As the needs of LGBTQ+ people have changed so have theobjectives of the LGBTQ+ community, responding to an evolving landscape as well as tochanges to health and support needs. The LGBT Foundation as well as its predecessor, theLesbian & Gay Foundation, were formed by the merger of two community groups, all of whichinitially served LGBTQ+ people throughout Manchester. In April of 2000 the ManchesterLesbian & Gay Switchboard Services (MLGSS) which began life in January of 1975 mergedSantiago 29with Healthy Gay Manchester (HGM) to form the Lesbian & Gay Foundation (LGF). Eventually,the LGF became inclusive of both bisexual transgender indiviudals and subsequently changedtheir name to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Foundation. Such changes werecrucial in the rapid growth of the currently named, LGBT Foundation. It took the mergers ofseveral LGBTQ+ activist organizations to expose the LGBTQ+ community to one another,further giving them the power of collective action.Following the decriminalization of homosexuality in 1967, Ian McKellen and MichaelCashman came together and created a Helpline to provide an information and support service forthe growing number of men starting to come out. To this day, the Helpline remains a vital part ofthe Foundation’s work, delivered by both staff and trained volunteers. In 1994, their currentChief Executive Paul Martin became one of the founder members of Healthy Gay Manchesteronly five years after his arrival. The charity was orignally formed in response to the HIVepidemic and was dedicated to improving sexual health amongst gay and bi men, but was toosuccesful to end. So, it stuck around as a safe space for LGBTQ+ individuals. In April 2000 thetwo charities merged, becoming the UK’s largest health and community charity for LGBTpeople, yet it retained its community activism origins. In 2015, they became fully trans inclusiveand changed their name to LGBT Foundation.Throughout this period in time, the LGBT foundation witnessed and responded to: thecountry’s response to the decriminalization of homosexuality; the emergence of HIV and AIDSand its devastating impact as well as the inspirational response from their communities; thepassing and the subsequent abolition of Section 28; the removal of homosexuality from theWHO list of mental illnesses; the ending of the ban on LGBT people serving in the armed forces;the gaining of adoption rights for same-sex couples and equal birth rights for lesbians andSantiago 30bisexual women; the passing of the Gender Recognition Act; essential workplace protections aswell as protections in the provision of goods and services for all LGBT indiviudals; theintroduction of Civil Partnerships and same-sex marriage equality (LGBT Foundation, 2021).The LGBT foundation will not stop in its efforts for equality. They have formed numerousinitiatives to combat the events listed above that played key roles in the change. Some of theseinclude, but are not limited to; MeSMaC formed in response to HIV and Healthy GayManchester.The LGBT Foundation believes that true equality will not be possible without allmembers of LGBT communities feeling welcome, heard, and represented (LGBT Foundation,2021). The LGBT Foundation is united in their efforts to build a better world for every person intheir uniquely diverse community because, as their organization says, there cannot be equalityfor some without equality for all. Earlier this year, the LGBT Foundation launched a newcampaign that they termed EqualityWins in an attempt to bring a voice to all LGBT people,especially those who are underrepresented or marginalized. The EqualityWins campaign bringscommunities together in hopes to alter the stigma and attitudes held by society through collectiveaction. The EqualityWins campaign creates a movement for change, campaigns to protect andextend LGBT rights, and challenges prejudice and discrimination wherever it may exists.Although, there is still much more that needs to be done in order to ensure a safe, healthy andequal future for LGBT people worldwide. There have been several occasions in recent years thathard fought LGBT rights were never actually guaranteed. This is an ongoing issue throughoutthe world and organizations such as the LGBT Foundation are needed in those unjust momentsto be the voice of the LGBT community.Santiago 31Despite the backlash and opposers, the LGBT Foundation will continue to support andchampion the full diversity of LGBT communities worldwide. Their EqulityWins campaignbrings LGBT communities together to challenge prejudice, raise awareness and change heartsand minds in wider society. They have seen from recent campaigns, such as their LGBTinclusive education campaign, that when their communities come together they are able tomobilize policy-makers, LGBT communities and the wider public under the banner ofEqualityWins. Collectively, the LGBT community can achieve a fair and equal society where alllesbian, gay, bi and trans people have the ability to live their life free of discrimination andjudgement. The LGBT Foundation is pushing to make this vision a reality. To help structure theirwork, all of their principal activities fall into the following strategic goals: achieving equality,encouraging wellbeing, and promoting safety. The LGBT Foundation is making change happenby ensuring that LGBT people’s voices are heard, reducing isolation amongst LGBTQ+communities, and helping people feel more confident and in control of their lives which in turnmakes the world a more safe and equal space for the LGBT community.2019-2020 was a remarkable and record-breaking year for the LGBT Foundation. Withthe support of their funders and donors, they were able to be a prominent leader throughout theCovid-19 pandemic. In 2019-20, they responded to the Covid-19 pandemic by becoming a fullyremote service delivery charity in just a week in hopes of allowing LGBT communities to havecontinued access to vital services at a time that was extremely challenging for many. Also in2019, the organization celebrated a huge milestone, this being the 45th anniversary of theirhelpline. During the pandemic, the organization offered a vital lifeline to 2,886 LGBT people viatheir helpline. A total of 411 hours of support were given to LGBT individuals. The organizationalso provided 3,623 hours of counseling to 505 Talking Therapies clients from 2019-2020. InSantiago 32addition to their helpline and counseling service reaching record breaking numbers, theorganization celebrated the 25th anniversary for their Condom and Lube Distribution Scheme.Since the scheme launched in 2012, they have distributed over 31 million condoms and sachetsof lube. To conclude the year, the LGBT Foundation launched a number of exciting newprograms and areas of work including: Pride in Ageing, Bi Program, Men’s Program, BringDementia Out, and Making Smoking History LGBT. They also won the prestigious QueensAward for Voluntary Service for their incredible Village Angels Volunteers. This is the highestaward given to volunteer groups across the UK, and is the organizational equivalent of a Memberof the Order of the British Empire award (MBE). The LGBT Foundation has been relentless inits fight against inequality. Even during a challenging time like the Covid-19 pandemic, theorganization's strength and dedication was demonstrated.Even in 2022, LGBT people still face persecution, discrimination and stark healthinequalities. Through their services they reduce isolation amongst their communities, help peoplefeel more confident and in control of their lives, and enable them to flourish. Every year theygive a voice, provide help and offer hope to a minimum of 40,000 people throughout the UK.The organization often works in partnership with others to build strong, cohesive and influentialLGBT communities to further promote a norm change in society. Their services and activitiesinclude: a range of support groups; face-to-face counselling; a helpline, email and pop-in service;a befriending scheme; a sexual health program, a substance-misuse project; organisationaltraining; a range of guides and resources; a national website; advice surgeries; LGBTinfrastructure support; various research projects and policy campaigning. Through strictly theironline services, the organization reaches about 600,000 people online each year. Throughout2021, they have delivered 1,035 LGBT-affirmative and inclusive talking therapy sessions to 276Santiago 33people, assisted 2,634 people who were in need of immediate assistance by giving them access toadvice and support through their helpline, email, and pop-in service. In latter part of 2021, theLGBT Foudation provided a total of 260 full sexual health screenings and 498 HIV tests to theLGBTQ+ community so that iniviudals can have safe sex. To close out the year, the organizationdistributed over a quarter of a million condoms and loose sachets of lube throughout GreaterManchester, and helped numerous LGBTQ+ individuals make friends, build their networks, andreduce loneliness through their Befriending scheme. They also supported 561 LGBT peoplethrough their support and social groups and helped 4,605 people have a safer night out with theirVillage Angels program. Their support services are delivered by a team of dedicated full-timestaff and volunteers. So whether it's relationships, coming out, family issues, knowing your legalrights, reporting a hate crime, or you just need someone to talk to, members of the LGBTQ+community can get in touch with the LGBT Foundation and receive the assistance that they need.Regardless of the circumstances, they are there to support all members of the LGBT community.Overarching ConnectionsThere are several overlapping connections between the LGBT foundation and Stonewall.Both are prominent actors in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the UK. They have built theirreputation by being active in their local communities and by providing support for members ofthe LGBTQ+ community who need it. These two organizations have made similar initiatives intheir fight for change, and together have had a massive impact on LGBTQ+ rights in the UK.Without LGBTQ+ organizations, such as Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation, pushing forLGBTQ+ rights in the UK it is untellable where the UK would currently stand on the matter.Although they are not the only actors in the fight for change within the UK, they have had atremendous effect on policy and the community. The LGBT Foundation’s programs have helpedSantiago 34lift individuals out of solitude by providing them with a support system with programs such asRainbow Brew Buddies and Pride in Practice. These two programs have helped countlessindividuals find someone to talk to that truly understands them for who they are. Rainbow BrewBuddies and Pride in Practice programs serve a similar focus to Stonewall’s constant helplinethat gives the LGBTQ+ community someone to talk to whenever they may need it. These twoorganizations are fighting for the same cause, and have declared on countless occasions that theywill continue to fight for LGBTQ+ rights until the entire world treats LGBTQ+ individuals asequals. They have influenced society with their programs and activism in a way that has changedreligious, political, and social societal ideals.Santiago 35Chapter 2 - United StatesThe United States is renowned for being a country with a government that offersfreedoms in a wide range of areas, such as speech, assembly, and religion. With this being said, itis quite shocking that the freedoms for those who identify as LGBTQ+ have been so heavilyrestricted throughout history, from limitations on openly being part of the LGBTQ+ communityand serving in the military to restrictions on necessities such as shelter. Decades of both physicaland mental abuse have led countless members of the LGBTQ+ community to be diagnosed withanxiety and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), along with high rates of suicide and substanceabuse (ODPHP, 2018). To put this into context, LGBTQ+ individuals are three times as likely toexperience a mental health disorder in comparison to individuals that identify as straight and sixtimes as likely to experience depression. Approximately 40 percent of LGBTQ+ adults had amental illness in the past year, in comparison to 18 percent of total adults who faced a mentalillness in the past year (ADAA, 2022). It is truly unjustifiable as to why these individuals are stillbeing mistreated today, in the twenty-first century. These policies often stem from religiousnotions that are embedded deep in politics and just in the US as a whole; with numerouspoliticians often using religion as their rationale behind their discriminatory views. There will betwo organizations examined in the US to assess LGBTQ+ rights within the country: the NationalLesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA) and the National LGBT Chamber ofCommerce (NGLCC), which are both well-known for fighting for change in US legislationwithin the LGBTQ+ sphere. By examining these two organizations, there is a glimpse at howsocial movements have impacted both public opinion and policy. It is important to consistentlyand thoroughly study shifts in policy and public opinion for members of the LGBTQ+Santiago 36community because there have been constant shifts within society; which is essentially due tochanges in societal norms.Santiago 37Marriage Equality in the United StatesBetween 1998 and 2005, state ballot initiatives to ban gay marriage were commonplacein the American political scene. Within this time period, 19 states passed ballot measuresamending their constitutions to prohibit same-sex marriage. This period also represented whenefforts to legalize same-sex marriage began to come about across the country, leading to severalchallenges at both the state and national levels. At the federal level alone, same-sex couples weredenied access to more than 1,100 federal rights. Currently, even with legislation being on theirside, LGBTQ+ individuals still struggle to be accepted and are forced to face nonsensicalobstacles. For example, roughly two years after nationwide same-sex mariage legaliztion, it wasstill common for individuals in the LGBTQ+ community to have to endure physical attacks,rape, arbitrary detention, the denial of rights to assembly, torture, and discrimination inemployment, health and education (Lee & Ostergard, 2017).Within the U.S., attention was first brought to the controversial topic of same-sexmarriage in 1970; when a same-sex couple in Minnesota, Jack Baker and Michael McConnell,were denied a marriage license by Hennepin County. After getting denied, Baker and McConnellthen took their case to the state Supreme Court, where they lost their case in a one-sentencedismissal. This case played a crucial factor in the pushing of same-sex marriage in followingdecades (Georgetown, 2021; Howard, 2021). In 1973, Maryland became the first state to bansame-sex marriages and after this, issues with same-sex marriages in the U.S. really began toarise. A decade after, in 1983, spousal rights of same-sex couples became the focus when alesbian couple was confronted with the spousal rights issue after one of them had been in a caraccident and her significant other was denied the right to take care of her. Then in 1989, courtrulings in New York and California declared to define same-sex couples as families. A few yearsSantiago 38after this, in 1992, same-sex employees begin to receive domestic partner benefits from LeviStrauss & Co. and the state of Massachusetts. Following this, in 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Courtruled that same-sex marriages cannot be denied without there being a compelling reason to do so.Hawaiin legislators then responded to this by passing an amendment to ban gay marriage.Following Hawaii’s actions, in 1995 the governor of Utah signed a state Defense of Marriage Act(DOMA) statute into law, and soon after this President Cliton signed the federal DOMA in 1996.Following, in 1997 Hawaii begins takes a more progressive stance, becoming the first state tooffer domestic partnership benefits to same sex couples. In 1998, Alaskan and Hawaiian votersapprove state constitutional bans on same-sex marriage. In 1999, Vermonts Supreme Court ruledthat same-sex couples must receive the same benefits and protections as any other marriedcouple under the Vermont Constitution and roughly a year after this ruling, the CentralConference of American Rabbis agrees to allow religious ceremonies for same-sex couples.In 2002, Nevada followed Alaska and Hawaii and voted to approve a state constitutionalban on same-sex marriage. Later in 2003, a proposed amendment to the federal Constitution wasintroduced to the House of Representatives. This amendment defined marriage as only between amale and a female. In the same year, The US Supreme Court decided on Lawrence v. Texas;which resulted in the striking down of sodomy laws and enacting a broad constitutional right tosexual privacy, California passed a domestic partnership law which provided same-sex partnerswith almost all the same rights and responsibilities as spouses in civil marriages, President Bushstated that marriage should be reserved for heterosexuals and finally, Massachusetts became thefirst US state to legalize gay marriage. The following year, the city of San Francisco began tomarry same-sex couples in an open challenge to Califironia law, New Mexico began to issuemarriage licenses to same-sex couples as their law does not make a reference to gender, andSantiago 39Portland, Oregon begen to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In the same year,Missouri voted to ban same-sex marriage, Washington state said yes to same-sex marriage in asupreme court decision, and the California Supreme Court voided same-sex marriages. In anattempt to prevent the legalization of same-sex marriages, numerous US states either passedinitiatives to ban same-sex marriages or rejected attempts to reverse previous bans on same-sexmarriages.In 2005, a New York state judge called the state ban on same-sex marriage illegal,Californias legislature attempted to pass a law legalizing same-sex unions but it was vetoed bythe governor, and Connecticut became the second state to approve same-sex unions. In 2006, theNew Jersey Supreme Court ordered the legislature to recognize same-sex unions. Two yearslater, Californias Supreme Court overturned the ban on gay marriage; which in turn led toCalifornias voters approving a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. Florida and Arizonavoters then did the same. In 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court overturned the state ban on same-sexmarriage, Vermonts legislature legalized same-sex marriages, Maine and New Hampshire followsuit, but Maine voters later repealed the state law allowing same-sex marriage. In 2010,Californias voter-passed ban on same-sex marriage from 2008, known as Prop 8, is finallydeclared unconstitutional. In 2011, President Obama declared DOMA unconstitutional, and NewYork legalized same-sex marriage. In 2012, the Ninth Circuit found Prop 8 unconstitutional andWashington state, Maine, and Maryland legalized same-sex marriage by popular vote. In 2013,Rhode Island, Delaware, Minnesota, New Jersey, Hawaii, Illinois, and New Mexico legalizedsame-sex marriage. Also in 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court found Section 3 of DOMAunconstitutional, and decided that the Prop 8 defenders lacked standing, thus allowing forsame-sex unions to be legalized in California. To close out 2012, the IRS began to recognizeSantiago 40same-sex married couples, and lastly, Utahs same-sex marriage ban was found unconstitutional.In 2014, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Kansas, and South Carolina legalizex same-sex marriage and thePresbyterian church voted to allow same-sex ceremonies (Georgetown, 2021; Howard, 2021).Also, the U.S. Supreme Court decided on a case that allows for same-sex marriage in 5 states(VA, OK, UT, WI, and IN), but declined to make a statement for all states. As of August 2014,19 U.S. states legally recognized the marriage of same-sex relationships. Finally, in 2015, theU.S. Supreme Court put an end to all state bans on same-sex marriage, legalized it in all fiftystates, and required states to honor out-of-state same-sex marriage licenses in the case Obergefellv. Hodges (Georgetown, 2021). Nevertheless, this is not the end of the discrimination thatsame-sex couples have to endure.Public Perceptions and Status QuoCurrently, views on same-sex marriage are quite polarized within the U.S. A 2019 PewResearch Center poll found that 61% of Americans supported same-sex marriage while 31%were still against it, and the last 8% had no opinion (Pew Research, 2019). The results from thisstudy directly correspond with the current status quo within the U.S. As seen in the past twodecades, there has been a dramatic increase in general acceptance of the LQBTQ+ community, aswell as same-sex marriage. An important reason for this increase is that the changing socialnorms on gender relations and the family have significantly altered the institution of marriage(Ogletree, 2014). The contestation of existing rules and norms played a crucial role ininstitutional transformation: institutions are subject to change when their ideational foundation ischallenged and the people no longer deem it necessary to comply (Capoccia, 2016). This is thecase with marriage equality, which rose as a policy issue during a time of religious decline(Amato, 2004).Santiago 41Marriage is a matter of public policy, which can be defined as an authoritative decision,backed up by sanctions from a government on behalf of its citizens to change or maintain thestatus quo, which can be expressed through laws or judicial rulings and typically affectseveryone in society (Howlett and Cashore, 2014). The government can decide to change thestatus quo and eliminate the specification of gender in marriage, transforming the institution ofmarriage by changing the way it organizes society and embodies its values. On the contrary,marriage equality is part of those politically generated rules of the game that directly help toimpact the lives of modern citizens (Pierson, 2006).A useful example to examine here is that of Hawaii. As previously noted, in 1993Hawaii’s Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriages cannot be denied without there being acompelling reason to do so. As a direct result of this ruling, Hawaiin legislators immediatelypassed an amendment to ban gay marriage. This example encapsulates the polarization of viewsat the time and demonstrates the backlash that was coming from both individuals and states.Then following Hawaiis legislative actions, President Cliton signed the federal DOMA in 1996which allowed states to make their own decision on same-sex marriage rights. This in turn putslegislative bodies up against one another because, as seen with Hawaii, the polarization within anarea can lead to contradicting policies.Political Association/PolarizationIn a 2009 study, researchers analyzed the determinants of support for measures for gaymarriage bans, as expressed by the countywide vote of those in favor of gay marriage bans.Several different hypotheses were explored that examined whether each county was urban orrural, as well as what the political and demographic characteristics of the county residents were.The findings showed that countywide support for the Republican Party, along with lower incomeSantiago 42and education levels, are associated with support for gay marriage bans (Burnett & Salka, 2009).Focus on the Family,  a global Christian ministry, predicted to USA Today a month before theNovember 2006 balloting that all gay marriage bans would pass since voters “believe thatmarriage is the union of one man and one woman” (Frank, 2006). Following this, the electoralmajorities passed constitutional bans on same-sex marriage in seven states. The anti-gayconstitutional amendments received less than 60% of the vote in four of the states, Colorado(56–44%), South Dakota (52–48%), Virginia (57–43%) and Wisconsin (59–41). However, inIdaho (63–37%), and especially in the southern states of South Carolina (78–22%) andTennessee (81–19%), the margins were more overwhelming  (Burnett & Salka, 2009). Barth,Overby, & Huffmon (2009), suggested that the United States is divided between traditionalists orcultural conservatives, and modernizers or progressives, with the divides often falling on a smalltown versus urban basis.O’Reilly and Webster (1998) found that patterns of support for three anti-gay referenda inOregon in 1988, 1992, and 1994 were closely associated with patterns of support for theRepublican Party in gubernatorial and presidential elections. Those backing gay rights, incontrast, tend to be younger, secular, minorities, better educated, urban, and individuals earninghigher income. Egan and Sherrill (2006) found that party identification and political ideologywere strong predictors in the 2006 national election, with gays and lesbians a strong part of theDemocratic voting bloc. Gay and lesbian voters cast 75% of their ballots in 2006 for Democraticcandidates, topped only by Blacks (89%) and Jews (87%).Religious InfluenceHistorically influenced by Christianity, marriage has been characterized as a heterosexualinstitution aimed at providing a stable, indissoluble basis for the family, with state policiesSantiago 43regulating and promoting it as a way of living and providing unique rights, responsibilities, andobligations to those who enter a marital union (Calhoun, 2000). In a recent study by PewResearch, researchers found that roughly half of Christians support same-sex marriage and theother half oppose same-sex marriage. It is notable that when anaylzing the charts created by Pewresearch, it is the individuals who claim to strongly favor God who are also very likely to opposesame-sex marriages (Pew Research, 2020).Despite having the word “united” in its name, the United Methodist Church is quitedivided over LGBTQ+ issues, specically same-sex marriage (Anderson, 2020). It is the country’sbiggest mainline Protestant denomination, with roughly 7 million U.S. members. For now, theUnited Methodist Church sanctions marriage only between a man and a woman, and the church’sBook of Discipline says clergy who bless same-sex marriages in United Methodist sanctuarieswill have to face the consequences and can possibly lose their career. Many liberal memberswould like to follow the lead of other mainline denominations and allow same-sex marriage, buttoo many conservative members are opposed, and it is these differing viewpoints that led to theidea of splitting the denomination (Anderson, 2020). Polarized views within a church arecommonplace with the dilemma of same-sex marriage. The Evangelical Lutheran Church inAmerica (ELCA) has also had a history of internal division on LGBTQ+ issues. Thedenomination leaves it up to the individual clergy in accordance with their congregation todecide whether it is permitted to marry same-sex relationships. Some liberal ELCA churcheshave been ecstatic about the chance to marry gay and lesbian members, while others havedecided against it (HRC, 2021).There are also churches such as the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, a moreconservative denomination, that are completely against same-sex marriage, calling it “contrary toSantiago 44the will of the Creator” (HRC, 2021). Along with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, themajority of the Baptist churches are against same-sex marriage. The predominantly whiteSouthern Baptist Convention, with almost 16 million followers, has taken a leading roleopposing same-sex marriages (HRC, 2021). Finally, the Catholic church teaches that all sexoutside of marriage is sinful, and that marriage is reserved for one man and one woman.Catholics are the world’s largest denomination, consisting of roughly 1.2 billion members,including 78 million in the United States. Liberal Catholics had hoped that Pope Francis wouldshed some light on this issue, but he never has (HRC, 2021).Santiago 45National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association & National LGBT Chamber ofCommerceThe previous informartion discussed gives insight on how the US’s views on same-sexmarriage views are not only polarzised between people, but between also between states. Thereare several factors that contribute to an individuals views on same-sex marriage that werediscussed such as religion, policial affiliation, and public perception/status quo. This informationis needed in order to fully understand the relevance of the case studies, as they have not directlyaltered legislation but rather have been a part of the push to challenge the norms of societythrough collective action. For the purpose of this study, I have chosen to focus on two renownedorganizations within the US: National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association & NationalLGBT Chamber of Commerce. I will be examining these organizations' impact on the US as awhole as well as examining how they made this impact. The rationale behind choosing these twoorganizations is that they are prominent throughout the US and have been leading actors in thefight for LGBTQ+ rights since the uprising of the LGBTQ+ social movement.National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA)The National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA) has been a leading actorin the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the US and stands by all members of the LGBTQ+ communityregardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, etc. NLGJA is a strong voice in the news industry,educating newsroom decision-makers about coverage of the LGBTQ community, promotingnon-discrimination policies and the establishment of equal benefits, and creating educationalopportunities for future leaders. Though, the journalist-led organization is much more than wordscan explain. NLGJA promotes diverse and inclusive workplaces by holding the industryaccountable and by providing education, professional development and mentoring (NLGJA,Santiago 462021). The organization envisions fair representation and respect of diverse LGBTQ+communities in newsrooms and news coverage, and will not stop fighting until this goal isachieved. Individuals, especially in the 21st century, receive much of their news through the newsmedia. Proper media coverage on controversial topics such as same-sex marriage is crucial to theprogression of a stigma and norm change. It is often norms that change first and then thosechanges tend to lead to changes in legislation. A LGBTQ+ voice is needed in the media in orderto really bring about change within society making NLGJA crucial to the development of theLGBTQ+ identity and LGBTQ+ rights.NLGJA’s story began in April of 1989 when the American Society of Newspaper Editors(ASNE) conducted its first survey on LGBTQ+ journalists in American newspapers,Alternatives: Gays and Lesbians in the Newsroom. Following this, in April 1990, the survey’scoordinator Roy Aarons presented the results of the standout survey in Washington, D.C., andconcluded the presentation with him coming out as gay (NLGJA, 2021). Inspired by the reportand Roy’s courage, LGBTQ+ journalists from across the United States and across mediaplatforms expressed a desire to create a professional organization. Under Roy’s guidance,NLGJA: The Association of LGBTQ+ Journalists was formally introduced in 1991 and chapterswere formed throughout the country.Aligning with its mission, NLGJA is a dominant voice in the news industry; by educatingnewsroom decision-makers about LGBTQ+ coverage, promoting non-discrimination policiesand equal benefits, and laying the groundowk for future LGBTQ+ leaders by creatingeducational opportunities that support the next generation of LGBTQ+ newsroom leaders(NLGJA, 2021). The dramatic positive shift in the quality and quantity of news coverage of theLGBTQ+ community is due to NLGJA members working within their newsrooms to educateSantiago 47peers about fairness and accuracy. NLGJA’s main goals are to enhance the professionalism, skillsand career opportunities for LGBTQ+ journalists, and strengthen the identity, respect and statusof LGBTQ+ journalists in the newsroom and throughout the practice of journalism. NLGJAadvocates for the highest journalistic and ethical standards in the coverage of LGBTQ+ issues,collaborates with other professional journalist associations and promotes the principles ofinclusion and diversity, and finally, provides mentoring and leadership to future LGBTQ+journalists (NLGJA, 2021). These objectives shape NGLJA’s mission statement and as anorganization overall.After their founding in 1990, NLGJA put out their first set of alternatives the followingyear in 1991; Roy Aarons coined this moment a major milestone in the organization’s efforts inbuilding the organization. A year later, in 1992, NLGJA hosts its first national convention in SanFrancisco and over 300 lesbian and gay journalists atended, many of which have yet to come outpublicly. On that same night, there was a videotaped message played by New York Timespublisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., promising that the Times will begin to offer domestic partnersbenefits; which was a revolutionary change for such a major publisher. The conventions turnoutnearly doubled the same year at their second convention that was held in September of 1992,where they had roughly 600 journalists come out to support. This is just the beginning forNLGJA. In 1993, after a meeting between NLGJA and NBC News, NBC puts out a memo toemployees and reminds them of its policy not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.At this point, NLGJA has 13 chapters and is rapidly growing in popularity. In 1994, NLGJApublished “Domestic Partner Benefits: At What Cost?,” which was a guide for news mediacompanies on how to properly institute domestic partner health benefits. At the time, only tenmedia companies were known to offer domestic partner benefits and NLGJA wanted to makeSantiago 48domestic partner benefits widely known and offered. Later in 1994, NLGJA popular memberSteven Gendel became the first journalist to disclose that he is gay on a major network when hedicussed it on an NBC broadcast of the Stonewall Celebration. This was extremely impactfulbecause no one had publicly come out on a live network before; definitely not in the fashion thatGendel did. This paved the way for other journalists to disclose and openly discuss theirsexuality on or off the air.NLGJA’s fight for equal rights did not stop here. To assist in the expansion of LGBTQ+rights, in 1995 NLGJA assisted a Canadian organization form its own National Lesbian and GayJournalist Association. Also in 1995, NLGJA and the Radio and Television News DirectorsFoundation published, Another Perspective: A report on Gay and Lesbian Issues in ElectronicJournalism. This survey exposed the truth, which was that most individuals were unimpressedwith the quality and extent of coverage of many LGBTQ+ issues (NLGJA, 2021). Then, in 1996,the renowned Washington Post refused to extend benefits to domestic partners; but in the sameyear, the Hearst Media group extended benefits to domestic partners. Hearst Media group wasnot the only one though, Knight-Ridder followed their lead and soon after there were 56 newsorganizations offering domestic partnership benefits. Theorist Finnemore and Sikkink wouldargue that this was the tipping point for domestic partner benefits, as there was a clear dominoeffect that occurred.Jumping ahead to 2000, NLGJA starts off the year by celebrating its 10 th Anniversary at agala in San Francisco. The organization at this point now has 1,000 members in its 19 chapters,not including those in Germany and Canada. NLGJA also launched a new survey, Lesbians andGays In the Newsroom: 10 Years Later. The survey received a lot of attention and had positivefeedback from the media. In 2001, NLGJA was recognized for its hardwork and perseverance inSantiago 49the fight against LGBTQ+  inequality by the Gill Foundation and was awarded $100,000, thelargest awarded to NLGJA since its first award in 1995. NLGJA members and staff workendlessly with their colleagues in the news industry to fulfill the organization’s mission of fairand accurate coverage.NLGJA is so dedicated to achieving their mission of fair and accurate representation thatthey developed the Rapid Response Task Force (RRTF). RRTF was created for moments when amore targeted response is required to promote greater understanding about how to fairly andaccurately represent the LGBTQ+ community. RRTF is a panel of working journalists frommainstream and LGBTQ+ media who answer complaints about reporting that is deemed asunfair and/or inaccurate by its audience and NLGJA’s peer journalists. Since it began, the RapidResponse Task Force has not only informed countless newsrooms about appropriate terminologyand the appearance of bias, but has also used these contacts to spread awareness about issuesfacing the LGBTQ+ community. The Rapid Response Task Force relies on media consumers tobring the problematic coverage to light, otherwise they may never know of the issue. The TaskForce suggests that individuals submit a link to the story that they believe is unfair or inaccurate,and the Task Force will evaluate the submission, discuss it, and if appropriate, contact thenewsroom in question (NLGJA, 2021). The RRTF focuses on inappropriate and inaccurate mediacoverage and aims to not only challenge unfairness and inaccuracy, but it also aims to spreadawareness through action.  This is a crucial part of the organization because it gives theLGBTQ+ community the power to report and raise awareness on discriminatory and hateful acts.In the later part of 2001, NewsWatch, the Native American Journalists Association,National Association of Black Journalists, Asian American Journalists Association, NationalAssociation of Hispanic Journalists and NLGJA published an issue celebrating NLGJA’s 10 thSantiago 50Anniversary. This was crucial because it was one of the first times all of these journalistorganizations joined together for a project. The same year, NLGJA also ratified a strategic plan,which put emphasis on core program goal areas of membership and chapter growth; improvedcoverage of LGBTQ+ communities; expansion of benefits for LGBTQ+ employees; increasedstudent outreach and education; and more professional development training (NLGJA, 2021).Following this, in 2002, the Associated Press began to offer domestic partner benefits toLGBTQ+ employees and NLGJA became a voting member of the Accrediting Council onEducation in Journalism and Mass Communications. These were major steps were the LGBTQ+community, NLGJA has really put its foot in the door of change during this period.In 2004, NLGJA kicked off its Newsroom Outreach Project, which seeks to familiarizenewsroom leaders with NLGJA and discuss LGBTQ+ coverage issues; meetings were launchedthroughout the country. In 2005, NLGJA celebrated 15 years and they are now at roughly 1,200members and have 24 chapters spread throughout the country and affiliates in both Canada andGermany. The same year NLGJA unveils the LGBTQ+ Journalists Hall of Fame, honoring thestrong lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer journalists whose actions demonstrated bothexemplary professionalism and personal courage. It is really important to shine a light on suchprominent LGBTQ+ activists, so the Journalists Hall of Fame was a huge step in the rightdirection for NLGJA.In 2009, NLGJA formed the Student Advisory Committee, to aid in reaching out tostudents, creating education projects and building exposure among journalism schools. Also in2009 Re:ACT, the official NLGJA blog, went live and it more than doubled NLGJA’s exposureand traffic on the web. To bring 2009 to a strong close, UNITY: Journalists of Color will nowinclude the NLGJA, after the board of directors of both organizations agreed to the partnershipSantiago 51last week. NLGJA’s mission to advance the interests of LGBTQ+ journalists aligns withUNITY’s mission of ensuring that newsrooms, and news coverage, reflects the diversity ofLGBTQ+ communities. The joining of UNITY and NLGJA will further NLGJA’s goal ofobtaining fair and accurate coverage of LGBTQ+ issues in the news media and encouragingnewsroom diversity. The alliance with UNITY will help NLGJA continue its mission of ensuringthat newsrooms properly represent the LGBTQ+ communities UNITY’s immediate goal is towork on broadening their focus on diversity; this shift will strengthen UNITY’s position whenadvocating for specific types of inclusion. The alliance between NLGJA and UNITY allowsNLGJA members to participate in a broader discussion of issues that affect the LGBTQ+community since UNITY has such a diverse array of journalists. UNITY and NLGJA arecommitted to working toward a respectable, trustworth, and mutually advantageous alliance thatwill further advance their common mission.UNITY: Journalists of Color is a strategic alliance that advocates for adequate newscoverage for people of color, and aggressively challenges its organizations at all levels to reflectthe nation’s diversity. UNITY is composed of three national associations: Asian AmericanJournalists Association, National Association of Hispanic Journalists, and the Native AmericanJournalists Association. Not only does UNITY hold the largest gathering of journalists in thecountry, UNITY also supports research and advocacy initiatives that promote its mission(UNITY, 2021). The joining of UNITY and NLGJA will further advance marriage equality rightsfor all LGBTQ+ individuals regardless of race, nationality, ethnic origin, etc. As a matter of fact,NLGJA has now become a part of a social movement that can often be seen as intersecting withthe LGBTQ+ movement, this being the movement of equality rights regardless of race, ethnicity,nationality, etc.Santiago 52In February of 2010, over 60 of the nation’s top LGBTQ+ bloggers, reporters and editorstraveled to Philadelphia for the 4thannual LGBTQ+ Editors and Bloggers Convening. Hosted byNLGJA this invitation-only event has quickly become one of the most anticipated of the year.The goal of the forum is to strengthen the capacity of LGBTQ+ members of the media andblogosphere to truly understand and more effectively communicate issues regarding theLGBTQ+ community, and also to assist in the growth as LGBTQ+ bloggers in the nationalcommunity. The event was live tweeted by many of the participants, which played a large role inits popularity. The  event’s hashtag, #LGBTmedia13, became the top trending hashtag on Twitterthat same day (NLGJA, 2021).NLGJA strives to be the premiere network for LGBTQ+ media professionals. As you cansee with the plethora of actions that NLGJA has taken since they began in 1990, NLGJA has astrong voice not only throughout the US, but worldwide. The organization has fought for changefor over three decades now and has grown exponentially throughout. NLGJA has never sat backand let LGBTQ+ individuals go underrepresented, as long as they have been around, they havemade the LGBTQ+ community's voice heard throughout the media and society.National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)The National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC) is the business voice of theLGBTQ+ community; it is the only national advocacy organization dedicated to expandingeconomic opportunities for the LGBTQ+ business community. The LGBTQ+ business ownersNGLCC represents generate over $1.7 trillion in economic impact, create jobs and innovatebusiness solutions throughout the country. NGLCC is the leading public policy advocate workingto include Certified LGBTBE® businesses in procurement opportunities at the federal, state andlocal level (NGLCC, 2021). With NGLCC’s Global initiative, the organization is growing andSantiago 53intends on expanding to five continents, thus improving economic opportunities and LGBTQ+human rights on a universal scale.The National LGBT Chamber of Commerce began in November 2002 when co-foundersJustin Nelson and Chance Mitchell were fed up with the impact of LGBTQ+ people on theAmerican economy going unrecognized despite economic equality being an important factor ofthe LGBT movement. The founders’ goal was to create an organization that could supportLGBTQ+ business owners and showcase the wide array of talents within the LGBTQ+community. After realizing that the economic impact, economic equality, and the impacteconomics could have on the future of the equality movement were rarely considered in politics,the founders felt as if they must spring into action. Justin Nelson and Chance Mitchell, thefounders, sought to show society that in addition to being LGBTQ+, many of these individualsare also business owners, employers, taxpayers, providers of healthcare and a dominant, essentialpart of the small business realm that keeps the U.S. economy strong (NGLCC, 2021). Anorganization that began with just a small group of activists is now the voice for the nation’s 1.4million LGBTQ+ business owners due to their hardwork and dedication. NGLCC has thesupport and participation of more than 200 corporate partners as well as prominent executiveleadership that assist the organization in promoting pro-business and LGBTQ+-inclusivepolicies. With the assistance of news outlets like the Washington Blade and Out magazine,NGLCC’s popularity began to grow very quickly. This motivated the organization and provedthat economic and social visibility are one of the same in the fight for equality and opportunityfor all. NGLCC has succeeded in large part due to dedicated individuals and boards, along withthe powerful businesses and corporate partners that have gotten involved since NGLCC’sfounding.Santiago 54Today, NGLCC has a network of more than 50 local, state, and international affiliateLGBT chambers of commerce, and serves to represent their economic interests and opportunities.In 2017 for the first time NGLCC released its proprietary data, the America's LGBT EconomyReport. A key finding reported was that the standard LGBTQ+ business has been in business formore than 12 years and that LGBTQ+ businesses account for more than $1.7 trillion to the U.S.economy and have also created over 33,000 jobs. In 2018 and early 2019, NGLCC won thepublic sector contracting inclusion of certified LGBTBEs in several cities; including Orlando,Florida; Nashville, Tennessee; Baltimore, Maryland; and Jersey City, New Jersey. Currently,California, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania also acknowledge certified LGBT-ownedbusinesses, along with major cities such as Seattle and Philadelphia (NGLCC, 2021).Beginning in 2004, the NGLCC began to offer certification to businesses owned by theLGBT community. NGLCC is the exclusive third-party certifying body for Certified LGBTBusiness Enterprise companies with their diversity certification program. More than 33% ofFortune 500 recognize this certification and will partner with NGLCC to create fullyLGBTQ+-inclusive markets (NGLCC, 2021). The goal of the certification is to help corporateand government procurement teams source LGBTQ+ owned products and services, known assupplier diversity. To obtain a certification, it is a multi-step process that involves an applicationand supporting documents, a on-site visit, and final approval before a national certificationcommittee. Though challenging, the certification program expands business opportunities toLGBTQ+ communities.In August 2007, the NGLCC signed a memorandum of understanding with the Women'sBusiness Enterprise National Council to provide opportunities for dual-certification as both awomen-owned, and LGBTQ+ owned, business. In 2011 the Human Rights Campaign (HRC)Santiago 55began including actively sourcing of LGBTQ+ certified businesses as part of the CorporateEquality Index, a national directory of LGBTQ+ friendly workplaces. In 2017, HRC furtherexpanded the index criteria to require LGBTQ+ inclusion in supplier diversity programs as astand-alone scored metric (NGLCC, 2021). The NGLCC also offers corporate membership andhas over 300 companies recognized as corporate partners of the NGLCC. These partnershipsprovide benefits such as access to certified suppliers, recognition of supporters of the LGBTQ+business community, and opportunities to share best practice in supplier diversity. The NGLCCrecognizes 10 companies as founding corporate members; those being IBM, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Chase, American Express, Intel Wyndham Worldwide, American Airlines, Ernst &Young, and Aetna Motorola (NGLCC, 2021). In August 2017 it was announced that the BillionDollar Roundtable will now include NGLCC certified LGBTBEs as a category of diversevendors counted by corporations spending a billion dollars or more on procurement withdiversity-owned firms. The Billion Dollar Roundtable was created in 2001 to recognize andcelebrate corporations that achieved spending of at least $1 billion with minority andwomen-owned suppliers. This was a huge step in the right direction for LGBTQ+ recognition ineconomics.In June of 2005, NGLCC became the first LGBT organization to ring the New YorkStock Exchange Closing Bell. In 2010 NGLCC began international work, which eventually ledto the development of NGLCC Global in 2013. In November 2011 the NGLCC unveiled a newSupplier Innovation Center; the center is designed to facilitate training opportunities and developbest practice for small businesses, and provide an opportunity for local start-ups to operate. In2014, AB1678 became the nation’s first public mandate requiring the inclusion of certifiedLGBT Business Enterprises in contracting with a statewide agency, the California PublicSantiago 56Utilities Commission. In 2015, Massachusetts became the first state to include certifiedLGBTBEs in statewide contracting, which was enacted by Governor Charlie Baker with theguidance of the NGLCC. In 2016, NGLCC helped introduce the New York State SupplierDiversity Act to intentionally include LGBTQ+, disability, and veteran owned firms in NewYork State contracting opportunities. In 2018 NGLCCs advocacy and public policy team wasresponsible for the inclusion of certified LGBTQ+ Business Enterprises in the cities ofBaltimore, Maryland and Jersey City, New Jersey. In this same year, the groundwork was laid forinclusive legislation to be implemented in Denver, the District of Columbia, Nashville, andseveral other major cities. Today in 2021, Three Rivers Business Alliance, working withNGLCCs advocacy and public policy team, was able to make the City of Pittsburgh the first cityin Pennsylvania to create an initiative that expands its inclusion of LGBTQ+ owned businessesand LGBTQ+ business opportunities (NGLCC, 2021).To conclude, NGLCC is dedicated to ensuring equal LGBTQ+ representation and equalLGBTQ+ rights. The organization has worked within the LGBTQ+ community since 2002fighting for economic equality. Though the organization's fight is still ongoing, the groundworkhas been laid and their voice is now being heard. The impact that NGLCC has already had onLGBTQ+ business plays a major factor in the progression that has been made within theLGBTQ+ community within the last two decades. NGLCC will continue the fight for LGBTQ+rights until equal rights and equity becomes the standard.Overarching ConnectionsThere are several overlapping connections between NGLCC and NLGJA. First, bothorganizations strive for the LGBTQ+ community’s right to equality and fair representation andtogether, have left a massive impact on LGBTQ+ rights in the US. Though the organizationsSantiago 57differ in their short-term goals, the overall missions of these organizations are one of the same.The general mission of these two organizations are to establish LGBTQ+ rights throughout notthe United States. Both also place partnerships and diversity as the primary focus of theirorganization; such as NLGJA’s collaboration with organizations like the Native AmericanJournalists Association, National Association of Black Journalists, Asian American JournalistsAssociation, National Association of Hispanic Journalists, and NGLCC’s collaboration withIBM, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, etc. The organization's partnerships have played a major role inthe shift in the societal stigma around the LGBTQ+ community. With more acceptance frommajor businesses, comes more acceptance from the local community.Although NLGJA and NGLCC are not the only actors in the fight for change within theUS, they have had a tremendous effect on policy and the community. For NLGJA, initiativessuch as the Rapid Response Task Force, Student Advisory Committee, and Newsroom OutreachProject have had an outstanding impact on the LGBTQ+ community by educating individualsand then using these contacts to spread awareness about issues facing the LGBTQ+ community,and for NGLCC, initiatives such as their diversity certification program and the addition of theWomen's Business Enterprise National Council, have had a lasting impact on LGBTQ+ business.Finally, NLGJA and NLGCC contributed to changes in legislation by their politicalactivism and collective action. Fighting in every battle that concerns LGBTQ+ rights, theseorganizations have placed political activism through collective action as their top priority. Theyfocus on shining a light on the issues regarding the LGBTQ+ community in the news media,which, unlike some other forms of activism, can continue to reach countless individuals for yearsto come. In today’s world, more and more people are looking to the media for their news. Thusfurthering the influence that these two organizations had on LGBTQ+ rights. By directlySantiago 58reaching the American public in a way that is accepting to homosexuality, these organizationshave played a major role in the shift in religious, political, and social societal ideals regardingsame-sex marriage.Santiago 59Chapter 3 - Comparison of RegionsAlthough the UK and the US are relatively close in proximity and are bothWestern-oriented regions with similar demographics, these regions greatly differ within theirhuman rights scope. When it comes to the LGBTQ+ community in particular, these regions havevarying degrees of freedom, which were examined and discussed throughout the previouschapters.Before I begin my analysis, the substantial progress that the UK and the US have made intheir respective LGBTQ+ communities within the past decade must be acknowledged. They bothbegan to recognize same-sex marriages and also began to set protections in place for members ofthe LGBTQ+ community. The UK’s and the US’ contributions to the LGBTQ+ community havemainly resulted from backlash that originated amongst the LGBTQ+ community members andadvocates of same-sex marriage rights, though their efforts have had different impacts that willbe assessed below. The variations in impacts led to several differences in the quality of life forthose in LGBTQ+ communities within the UK and the US. After analyzing these variations, Iwill discuss how the organizations examined played a major role in the push for both thelegislative change that occurred as well as the norm shift. The discussion section will be dividedinto two categories: a general comparison of the United Kingdom and the United States, and thenfollowed by a comparison of the case studies of the organizations examined.General ComparisonWithin the UK, though different countries are on different spectrums when it comes topolitical platforms and cultural norms, all offer opportunities to further enhance the quality of lifefor LGBTQ+ individuals. The steps the UK made toward equal marriage rights from theBuggery Act of the 1533 to full legalization almost 500 years later with the Marriage (Same SexSantiago 60Couples) Act of 2013 were extraordinary. The UK had been anti-gay with their legislation andculture up until the relatively recent changes in legislation. As noted in previous chapters, theUK often placed emphasis on cultural ties and religious heritage, though this does varydepending on where in the UK an individual is from. Several countries throughout the UK havesurprised the international community with their drastic norm shift from a focus on the Catholicreligion to a focus on creating an inclusive environment for all citizens. Today in 2022, they haveallowed same-sex marriage, marriage benefits for same-sex couples, and public access tohealthcare for citizens, regardless of aspects of their identity such as gender identity, race, andethnicity.When compared to the US, the UK has been a step ahead in their LGBTQ+ legislation forquite a while now. Though, both nations currently have legalized same-sex marriages and haveseveral renowned LGBTQ+ activist organizations within their country that are constantlyfighting for LGBTQ+ rights on a local and global scale as well as providing a line of support forLGBTQ+ individuals.In the US today, all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia must follow the 2015ruling on Obergefell vs. Hodges which ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment requires all statesto grant same-sex marriages and recognize same-sex marriages granted in other states. Althoughwhen analyzing the US on a state-level, there are differing levels of rights and limitations formembers of the LGBTQ+ community. For example, Massachusetts demonstrates a wide range offreedoms and protections from discrimination for the LGBTQ+ community. In Massachusettssame-sex marriage has been legal since May 17, 2004, due to the Massachusetts SupremeJudicial Court (SJC) ruling in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that it wasunconstitutional under the Massachusetts Constitution to strictly allow heterosexual couples toSantiago 61marry. Meanwhile, states such as Kansas were still fighting back against allowing same-sexmarriages even after the 2015 federal ruling. Kansas’ Gov. Sam Brownback and hisadministration refused to recognize same-sex marriages in Kansas until the so-called ‘issue’worked through all court procedures and appeals (Lopez, 2015). The term ‘issue’ is in quoteshere because this is not an issue, it is a human right. With this all being said, the legislativemeasures taken to allow same-sex marriage and overall ensure LGBTQ+ safety are requiered tostop their protections at the end of state lines due to jurisdictional boundaries. So, whenindividuals from the LGBTQ+ community move from state to state there are different laws inplace which in turn creates a huge challenge for members of the LGBTQ+ community. A primeexample of these laws is housing protections. In some states it is still legally allowed to deny amember of the LGBTQ+ community housing, whereas others states have made laws to end suchdiscriminatory practices toward the LGBTQ+ community.Overall, the UK places a much higher focus on LGBTQ+ rights than the US, as they haveinitiatives in place for health care access as well as initiatives for proper training of providers sothey can properly treat LGBTQ+ patients. Whereas in the US, there are still ongoing battlesabout healthcare issues such as whether a doctor can discriminate against LGBTQ+ individualsor not. Just recently in 2020, the Trump administration put a rule in place that allows doctors todiscriminate against LGBTQ+ patients (Burns, 2020). These forms of discriminatory policiesfurther perpetuaute hate crimes and discrimation against the LGBTQ+ community. On suchcontroversial topics like same-sex marriage the federal government must hold definitive stancesin order to ensure equality. The progression within the US is unpredictable, thus making the UKthe more stable nation and therefore a safer place for LGBTQ+ individuals to reside in today’sworld.Santiago 62Case Study ComparisonsBoth Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation can be considered prominent movements inthe UK’s sociopolitical landscape and the same goes for the National Lesbian and GayJournalists Association and the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce within the US. Theirwell-maintained web sites (www.stonewall.org.uk, www.lgbt.foundation, www.nlgja.org, andwww.nglcc.org) suggest that they use new media technologies to good effect, which helps makethem effective examples for this study. All of which are also active on various social mediaplatforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. After reviewing their platforms on socialmedia, I now have a better sense of how they virtually mobilize individuals. I found theirInstagram and Facebook accounts to be the most impactful. I am basing this off of their platformengagement and quality of posts. All four organizations used social media to raise awareness onpressing issues and to share their event dates, times, etc.To analyze how each organization uses media, their usage will be compared to severalfunctions that Rheingold (2003) argues as central to the way media is used by social activiststhroughout the world. According to Rheingold (2003), media technologies bring aboutinteraction that provides both opportunities and threats for activists in three key areas:dissemination of alternative news, creating virtual public spheres, and organizing collectivepolitical action. The functions that Rheingold discusses in this typology should not be seen asdefinite and distinct, but rather as overarching categories that illustrate the varying ways thenews media is used by social movements. Furthermore, some of the examples discussed could fitinto more than one category. The purpose of this is not to make a clear distinction betweenfunctions, but to provide a door opener into the social use of media by activists and socialmovements. The US organizations examined, NLGJA and NLGCC, revolve around the use ofSantiago 63the news media whereas the LGBT Foundation and Stonewall do not. Although the LGBTFoundation and Stonewall use the Internet and other new media technologies such as e-mail tospread information without the aid of the mainstream media, it is not part of their mission as it iswith NLGJA and NLGCC, specifically NLGJA. Stonewall and the LGBT Foundationunexpectedly received the highest rates of engagement on their social media accounts whenbeing compared to NLGCC and NLGJA.While comparable uses of media to those outlined by Rheingold (2003) could be found inthe activities of all of these organizations, there were also some differences that were worthnoting. The NLGJA and NLGCC take pride in their community outreach, as well as their abilityto publicly defend the LGTBQ+ community in the news media. NLGJA’s mission is to challengeindividuals who combat LGBTQ+ rights by using their ability to reach the public withjournalism. Whereas, Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation focus less on the news media andmore on connecting with leaders, both global and local, to push for change. As seen withNLGJA’s UNITY program and NLGCC’s Women's Business Enterprise National Council.Community outreach is a core focus for both Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation, but they tendto do so with their programs and by hosting events, rather through news media. Though, asmentioned earlier, both organizations are active on social media and in the news media just to afar lesser extent than their American counterparts. Therefore, as Rheingold suggests, both theorganizations within the UK and within the US use media to provide alternative news to what iscommonly overrun by mainstream journalism, to create alternative public spheres, as well as tomobilize for social activism.Although both the UK’s and the US’ organizations share the same organizationalstructure, they provide contrasting examples of initiatives taken in their fight for equality. TheSantiago 64US organizations examined have a more centered focus on the US LGBTQ+ movement alone,whereas Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation have much more of a wider scope and tend to takea more global stance. They are all centralized organizations but differ in their means of action.The US organizations examined also take a more written approach at combating these injustices;whereas the UK organizations, Stonewall and the LGBT Foundation, tend to focus more ontaking a hands-on approach with programs that assist and welcome the LGBTQ+ community.Prime examples include Stonewall’s Rainbow Laces campaign, Children and Young People’sServices Champions program and the LGBT Foundation’s Condom and Lube DistributionScheme and their Equality Wins campaign (Stonewall, 2021). Further, it seems as if the USorganizations examined, NLGJA and NGLCC, have managed to awaken a spirit of civiladvocacy and volunteerism amongst many middle-class citizens. Stonewall and the LGBTFoundation, by contrast, are mainly made up of locally based community members who aremostly unemployed, but volunteer for the organization. This is a fascinating find and cancontribute to studies on volunteerism within LGBTQ+ communities.This study also demonstrates the impact that these organizations had within theirrespective regions. The internal push for equal rights that was needed for legalization wasbrought about by these kinds of organizations and activists. It seems fair to say that without suchprominent movements in either region, it is untellable as to where these countries would standtoday in terms of legalization. The UK organizations Stonewall and LGBT Foundation have avery wide range of focuses and ultimately emphasize public activism and citizen advocacy topush their rights. On the contrary to the organizations examined in the UK, the US organizationsexamined have a more central focus on outreach by activism. For example, NLGJA and NLGCCpromote LGBTQ+ individuals in journalism and in the news media. It seems as if the generalSantiago 65outreach and broader mission led the LGBT foundation and Stonewall UK to their success,surpassing that of the US. Such examples include Stonewall’s Workplace Empowermentprogram that corresponds with the world’s leading employers and the LGBT Foundation’sHelpline that reaches thousands of LGBTQ+ individuals worldwide on a daily basis. The mosteffective way Stonewall and the LGBT foundation grew their following was by creatingprograms that brought the LGBTQ+ community together in a safe environment. Though, eventoday activists throughout both countries are still fighting for an overdue norm change, from oneof hate for same-sex relationships, to one of support and acceptance of all relationships.Though they were not the only organizations that were a part of this movementthroughout this time period, these organizations were all prominent actors throughout theLGBTQ+ movement and still are today. The US organizations played a major role in the changesof legislation. Not only did they push for legalization but there was also a major push for a normchange by these  organizations. Simply passing legislation was not enough to get rid of the hatethroughout society that could create barriers for same-sex marriages and for same-sex couples intheir day-to-day lives.VariationsVariation is almost guaranteed in all aspects of these cases as all four of theseorganizations have various governmental structures in place, governing political parties anddifferent policies that the individuals that reside within their nation must abide by. Variation ispossible within these nations for LGBTQ+ policies based on the public opinion of their citizensas well as their policies and how these policies affect the overall well-being of their citizens. Allof these organizations are fighting for the same cause but have different means of action andhave to combat different issues depending on their region. While a public opinion shift is crucialSantiago 66for change, it is weighted differently depending on the organization which leads to variation.Even with a constant push for change, injustices and unjust policies such as in the state of Kansashave held strong against social advocacy groups and activists. It was not until 2020 that Kansasprohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment,housing and accommodations (2021). It is crucial to examine variations because everygovernment, state, and person are different, and with this one can draw inferences and makerelevant connections. When examining prominent regions such as the US and the UK, there willalways be variation as they both maintain different values and design legislation as they see fitfor their region. Since these are such large nations as well, there is variation among memberstates. Similarly to Federalism in the US, the UK has a national government that oversees all ofits member states. In the UK, it is left up to the states to denote their own economic policy,employment rights and benefits, and rights of their citizens. This leads to variation betweenmember states response to social movements; although they may be very similar both culturallyand politically. Regardless of the variations, analyzing these two nations same-sex marriage andLGBTQ+ rights provide insight on how developed nations handle controversial topics.Santiago 67ConclusionThis undergraduate thesis explores the social upheaval that eventually led to changes inlegislation and norms throughout the US and UK, while also assessing the quality of life forLGBTQ+ individuals in these regions. The core of each country’s progress toward marriageequality rests on the public perceptions and religious and political affiliations of the community.These factors also directly correlate to changes in legislation as shifts in legislation, particularlyon controversial topics, do not occur without some form of social upheaval; which is where theLGBTQ+ movement came into play. These factors were all relevant to the status quo and publicperception of each country, which has guided legislation to where it is. Generally, this researchhas shown that as society becomes more progressive, it also starts to alter discriminatorylegislation.Overall, the UK proved to have more accepting legislation in place within their countries.The organizations analyzed in the case studies provided demonstrated the shifts in bothlegislation and norms as they constantly change their immediate goals over time to accommodatefor the changing needs of the LGBTQ+ community. The fight for marriage equality in the UKand US were prominent example of the steps it takes to get a government to alter discriminatorylegisation. When it comes to the United States, it remains a step behind the UK in respect to theLGBTQ community. Though the variation amongst member states plays a major role on the US’ability to surpass the UK in terms of progressive LGBTQ+ legislation. As we see vastdifferences in states such as Massachustetes, where LGBTQ+ rights became legal in 2004, incomparison with with a state like Kansas that decided it would not act on the federal legalizationof same-sex marriage until all appeals were dealt with. With this being said, the study furtherdemonstrates the importance of acknowledging variation when it comes to marriage equality.Santiago 68Analyzing these two nations has shown me the variation of views within these two affluentcountries is significant and due this variation, it is challenging to come to conclusive facts aboutthe US and the UK collectively because both are exceedingly polarized in their views.LimitationsThere are numerous limitations to this study, as it was conducted for undergraduate thesisand with the progression being only three semesters from start to finish. With more time, I wouldhave liked to study the LGBTQ+ movement more generally, analyzing how the global movementas a whole had an effect on universal marriage equality and overall quality of life of theLGBTQ+ community. I also would have added more case studies to each region to see if theyfollow the same trends of the previous researched case studies. Finally, it should also be notedthat the research, discussion, and conclusions above are based on articles up until March 11,2022, and this thesis will be published in April of 2022. In the future there may be changes thatrender some or all parts of this thesis to be insufficient or invalid due to the constant shifts inLGBTQ+ legislation and policy.Santiago 69ReferencesAnderson, M.

    "abstract": "Throughout history, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) have faced criticism and backlash for limitations on marriage equality. Within the last two decades, there have been many initiatives put into place to combat the marriage equality dilemma. I will be conducting two case studies on prominent social movements within the US and UK. Within the UK, I will be examining the Stonewall organization and the LGBT Foundation; and within the US, I will be examining the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association and National LGBT Chamber of Commerce. This root of the dilemma spurs mainly from human rights that are being challenged due to individuals\\u27 religious ideology. Aside from religious ideology, individuals who hold more conservative values tend to be against same-sex marriage and marriage equality; whereas individuals who hold progressive values tend to support same-sex marriage and marriage equality. Marriage equality should not be a dilemma, but unfortunately in the US and UK it is mainly a political dilemma; but is also a moral, ethical, and legal controversy. The purpose of this research is to compare and contrast marriage equality initiatives taken within the UK to the initiatives taken within the US. I will examine differences in legislation, court rulings, and norms. The final objective of this research is to draw conclusions on both the US’ and UK’s progress in obtaining marriage equality",
