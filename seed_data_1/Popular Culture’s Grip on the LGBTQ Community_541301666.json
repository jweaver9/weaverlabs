Through this routine exposure, like minded individuals are given theopportunity to come together, be it through virtual chat rooms, social media posts, or other onlinefollowings, which exist to amplify their shared beliefs.  It would be uncommon to find those whodo not frequent these virtual places, especially when these forums can be just a click away. Whilewe tend to socialize in more traditional settings like the home or the workplaces, social mediaand popular culture enables connection and voices without regards for status or preexisting socialties.Furthermore, while like minded individuals come together through their sharedexperiences and perspectives, popular culture can provide avenues for exposure that other routesof communication are incapable of providing due to their inherent animosity towards others.Opinions can be shared without a face to match, which is a powerful tool for some. We all reapthe benefits of having instant communication and media sharing at our fingertips throughout theday with how ingrained it is in our daily lives. Popular culture allows anyone to have anaudience, or simply to voice their opinions publicly. Individuals from seemingly all backgroundsin the modern world can be given a platform, so it would be only natural  to make the conclusionthat more voices would equal more representation. But how are these voices in the media2perceived? If these individuals finding their voices on Instagram or Tiktok,  movies, television,or music are people that do not fit the given social standard of the community, how are theyviewed by those cast in a more favorable light? And subsequently, how would public perceptionsinfluence the formations of groups and group opinions within that given sphere?The purpose of this research is to identify the causes and consequences of forming groupswithin this cultural sphere, specifically focusing on the LGBTQ community. I would contendthat the inclusion and exclusion of this marginalized group which exists within a largercommunity can be promoted or amplified by hegemonic forces through the use of popularculture and mass media. Firstly, with regards to this paper, I will identify what hegemonic powerdynamics are within the context of the thesis, as well as what it means to be a marginalized groupwithout much force within a power dynamic. Secondly, I will then explain how I collected theresources I will reference in later slides and any results I may have found. I will examine bothqualitative and quantitative data from scholarly journals later in the piece. To create a holistic,unbiased review and presentation of the results found, both instances of inclusivity andexclusivity will be used to determine how mass media perpetuates their beliefs and anyconsequences that might follow. I will subsequently extend the research to include a youngeraudience as well to explore the developmental effects of the inclusion and exclusion of groups onyouth. Lastly, I will explain why the importance of inclusion should matter to a larger audienceand how we can identify biases in media.However, before I begin to assess some of the essential concepts that should beunderstood before the research goes any further, I think it is important to know how I chose thistopic as well as the ongoing conversation around my thesis. With this in mind, it is important to3understand the concept of ingroup and out group biases. This concept is a psychologicalphenomenon which involves a pattern of favoring members of one's own “ingroup” (a socialgroup with which one identifies) over “outgroup” members (a social group with which one doesnot identify. Furthermore, the formation of these ingroups would cause group polarization tooccur, or the tendency for groups to show a shift towards the extremes of decision-making whencompared to decisions made by individuals. More simply, frequent exposure to like mindedindividuals can create a more extreme environment. These concepts are important for thefoundation of the research I have constructed, and for any resources I will use in the future.When I begin to cover how impressionable youth can become susceptible to exclusion, I willaddress the fundamental aspect of observational learning, or learning by observing others.Additionally, to give some clarity, I should explain what hegemonic powers are and why they areimportant to my thesis. Hegemony refers to the dominance that is maintained by one group overanother through societal norms, stigmas, or overwhelming force. In this case, the LGBTQcommunity would be in the minority, (or marginalized), and therefore be placed in a position ofinferiority in the social structure. This power dynamic between two unequal forces are at theheart of this ongoing conversation, as bias can vary in severity and be influenced heavily byothers.  The ideas of implicit bias should be introduced as well, or unintentional biases that canoccur even without acknowledgement.  Using these ideas, I was able to focus on what wasimportant to my research question as well as make sense of any results that I found during myanalysis.Prior to addressing the issues of grouping and group tensions,the public perception of theLGBTQ community in the eyes of the general public should be understood. The purpose of this4would be to attain more of a baseline grasp of the conversation prior to tackling the issues ofinclusion and exclusion. Furthermore, in order to add validity to any claims or conclusions I willmake after reviewing all the available information, it is important for my analysis to includequantitative data to solidify my evidence Calzo & Ward’s (2009) survey research on universitystudents found the following:Surprisingly, it was not current but past prime-time TV viewing and music video viewingthat were associated with greater attitudes of acceptance. Results were mixed formagazine reading, with popular culture magazines associated with greater attitudes ofacceptance, but teen magazines associated with less accepting attitudes. These findingshighlight the importance of considering media genre, and may speak to potentialdifferences in the content of particular print media and television programming. Forexample, teen magazines have been noted to be more conservative in their sexual content(e.g., Kim & Ward, 2004), and popular culture magazines may be more progressive.(Table 5).This source analyzes the connection between the perception of the LGBTQ community andmedia on college campuses in particular. More specifically, how popular culture can create amore favorable outlook on the gay or LGBTQ community within a college campus. They createda survey for these college students for them to record their attitudes towards homosexuality. Thiswas accomplished by giving them a set of questions in which they were able to choose “stronglyagree, agree” and so on. These questions were posed like “Homosexuality is a question ofmorality”. Then they surveyed each student’s media usage, asking them how long they spend oneach type of media. They also asked if they would consider themselves religious. Then they5collected all the data and created a chart to better understand and conceptualize. Within the datatable examined above, the attitude towards acceptances was measured and the values measuredshowed a mixed perception across gender and age ranges. And within this specific qualitativeanalysis, there is already evidence of group environments at play as it pertains to acceptance.Different students are attracted to different genres, and these group differences can be used topredict acceptance of LGBTQ lifestyles. Therefore, the type of media consumed can account forsome levels of inclusivity, and like minded fans of certain genres can be measured as havingdistinct preferences.Furthermore, it was concluded that while the attitude towards acceptance for someindividuals were definitely more positive, religious individuals had a more negative correlation,therefore pointing to the conclusion that the media genre is vital as content within differentpieces of media varies depending on the audience. This supports the notion of how important theingroup and outgroup bias phenomenon is in this context, since like minded audiences havesimilar trends in attitudes towards sexuality.This would be supported even further by Waggoners’ (2017) qualitative research done toexamine the relationships between the fans and LGBTQ identities on screen, which analyzes thereactions of the fans through data collection. It was concluded that, to a degree,  television tropescan have long lasting or harmful effects on the LGBTQ community which are a reflection ofhegemony within society. Media can be a powerful tool to use as a means to an end by those withinfluence, building controlling images and distasteful stereotypes to distance themselves fromthose who are outside the normality.6Yet as referenced before, media can be used irrespective of class or standing. A largeenough audience can create an inescapable message, and in Waggoners’ (2017) case it has anability to change powerful business structure with a large enough message:Considering hegemonic ideals presented in television, the prosumer culture associatedwith social media activism showcases the power shifts that have previously occurred forconsumer and prosumer cultures (Comor, 2011) from the historically capitalist hegemonypreviously presented on television (Mittell, 2010). Since media is a business first andforemost, for a show to actively lose their advertisers is perhaps the biggestaccomplishment for making any social change through creative storytelling. (Discussion).With enough pushback, there is evidence to suggest that change can be made through thesevirtual accumulations of people who advocate against corporate values willing to brush aside asmaller community in favor of gain.Furthermore, in order to better grasp public perception, celebrities in the eye of thegeneral populace can be used to gauge public opinion. In Bonds-Raacke et al.’s (2008) researchassessing the views towards prominent LGBTQ celebrities, figures indicated found:Results indicated that those recalling a positive portrayal later showed a more positiveattitude toward gay men than those recalling a negative portrayal, and women had a morepositive attitude overall than men toward gay men and lesbians. Such findings illustratethe importance of positive role models in entertainment media as potential primes ofsocial attitudes.(Abstract).Therefore, those who represent a certain community within a larger audience command massiveinfluence over their respective group, as it is a common and straightforward method for outsiders7to understand the marginalized community. Without these figureheads to break down barriers forothers, controlling images can reinforce the differences within society and create a toxicatmosphere where inequality may thrive.With public perceptions easily swayed by either group or outside opinion, it is thereforeessential to be surrounded by those who model exceptional values. If it is either a goal or desireto be accepting and inclusive, it is a must to form ties with those in mind. To extend this concepteven further, it could be suggested that this learned behavior can be traced to observationallearning in younger children. It is extremely important to highlight the dangers of perpetuatingstereotypes onto children, considering how almost all schemas and images of others are createdin part by learned experiences. Be that through parental guidance, media, or toys; children can beexposed to ingroup and outgroup biases at an early age which can sway opinions of others. andonly gives weight to the notion that group opinions are formed regardless of age restriction.Therefore,  even children can exhibit the same exclusive behaviors that a more mature individualdoes.Media is an important part of socialization for children and development, and this textanalyzes potential impacts gender stereotypes may have on impressionable youth. Furthermore,children can be more accepting across gender boundaries when given inclusive toys or media toplay with at an early age. Spinner et al.’s (2018) research would offer support to this notion withtheir research results:In addition, we observed a strong preference for same-gender playmates overother-gender playmates among participants in the stereotypic condition, but we observed8no preference for same-gender playmates over other-gender playmates amongparticipants in the counter-stereotypic condition. This choice of playmate in thecounter-stereotypic condition appeared to be driven more by the type of toy play beingmodeled by the child than by the child’s gender. (Discussion).Going even further, the researchers connect mass media to its inherent influence over childrenstating “Media represent a powerful socializing agent of gender-role norms because theycommunicate our cultural definitions of gender normativity in a myriad of formats andsettings”(Spinner et al. 2018), which emphasizes the need for parents to be wary of the choicesthey make towards their children and how seemingly smaller decisions of which toya to buy canconstruct a child’s understanding of gender. These findings are supported by more research doneto examine the power dynamics between young men and women in children with regards to themedia. , research conducted on the influence of exposure to superheroes on children and theindicators of hegemonic masculinity in later childhood. According to Coyne et al., their (2022)analysis  claimed:Overall, we found that early engagement with superheroes was indirectly associated withendorsement of the muscular ideal and some aspects of hegemonic masculinity five yearslater, as mediated by later superhero exposure.While this specific analysis did not reveal any concrete connection between gender, they didindicate how the absorption of superhero media  can promote masculine ideologies of strengthand muscular models, which were shown to influence both girls and boys similarly. This again9highlights the degree of importance mass media has on childhood development, as extremelypopular superhero icons can model behaviors which persist later into adulthood.Moving on to address the next portion of the research question, I will use research doneby Mahalia Jackman of the scholarly journal Human Rights Review, in which study sheresearched how prominent the disdain or hatred of homosexuals amongst Jamacians was duringthe given period. She chose songs which were listed amongst the most popular of the year, andcross referenced them with common homophobic slang of the given area. These songs would befrom the reggae genre, an immensely popular genre that is still prominent today. She thenaccumulated her results in the tables. Jackman’s accumulation (2022) resulted in a five - piececonclusion:This paper examined sexual prejudice present in some Jamaican songs. In this review, Ipresented five justifications for condemnation of homosexuality found in the music,which lie within the ambits of (1) gender role ideologies, (2) religious values, (3) itsunnaturalness, (4) the threat of homosexuality and (5) homosexuality being an alienlifestyle and un-Jamaican. (Discussion and Concluding Remarks).Through this data, the author is able to argue that prejudice is normalized and justified inJamaican society through music. Surprisingly, her methods revealed that during this period, it ismore likely that a trending song would suggest that homosexuality would be a “threat to thefabric of society” more often than not, as well as homosexuality being a sin. This staggeringlevel of homophobia was being promoted by people with a platform choosing to distancethemselves with those they consider a “threat” or, at the very least, stigmatized individuals ofJamaican society. With the popularity of these artists and songs, the influence of the media is10really on full display given this data. Furthermore, whilst this data is taken recently these songsare not modern, and the numbers referencing how “Jamaicans over the age of 18, 82.2 per cent ofJamaicans felt homosexuality was morally wrong and 85.2 per cent of them supported the banson anal sex in Jamaica”(Jackman, 2022) were taken almost a decade prior, what these figures addto the ongoing conversation remains the same. Moral values were reflected in the music of theperiod, and disregard for homosexuality was widespread and accepted. Changes in music andmedia will occur as the population matures overtime, yet its influence will remain the same.The methodology used in this research should be called into question, considering therewas no basis for which to choose the listed songs other than their popularity during the suggestedperiod. This could potentially skew the results if Jackman had already decided how she wantedher results to look; the researcher could have cherry - picked homophobic lyrics with the intentof proving a certain outcome. However, because of the immense popularity of not only thereggae genre, but of the songs themselves, I would contend that the lyrics are a fairrepresentation of values trending during the examined period. Given the reach of reggae itself, itwould be impossible to groups its listeners into a singular category and claim they are allhomophobic. However, artists with huge amounts of influence are perpetuating their ideals ontotheir listeners, which is a bold approach yet straightforward approach to their disdain towardsanother group. While trending topics or popular media can advocate both for inclusion andexclusion, Jackman’s research proves that there are certain negative consequences forhomophobic retorhic, which had been allowed to spread through the reggae genre.Inaccuracies can also be cause for exclusion, as they can perpetuate controlling imagesand stereotypes which exist to harm the image of those within the LGBTQ community. Without11regard for truth or accuracy, popular culture can cause false representation to slip into normality.Researchers Annati & Ramsey (2022) concluded that:This study addressed gaps in the literature regarding lesbian perspectives on theirportrayals in the media. Altogether, the findings suggest that while representations oflesbians in the media seem to be growing (GLAAD, 2019), the content of theserepresentations may continue to promote stereotypical and sexualized portrayals oflesbian women centering the heterosexual male gaze.This examination was aimed at seeing how accurately LGBTQ (more specifically lesbian in thiscase) images are portrayed in media through the eyes of the Lesbian commumnities themselves.It is important to stress that the lesbian community is not soley represented by this singluar study,and althought inaccuraces in representation should be examined, there are most definitely casesfor which the consensus leans more towards the positive.Additional evidence to suggest the sertotyping of LGBTQ individuals on televisionwould suggest that these controlling images extend across geographical boundaries, asreferenced when looking at trending Jamaican media. Further media portrayals can be referencedin van Meer & Pollmann’s (2022) quantitative findings:We conclude that there are stereotypical representations of LGBs on Dutch television.Multiple programs in the sample show gay men with feminine characteristics andmultiple programs include lesbian and bisexual women with masculine characteristics.Therefore these programs contribute to the stereotypes: ‘lesbians are masculine’ and ‘gaymen are feminine’. This effect is stronger for females than for males, because almost alllesbian and bisexual women were portrayed in a masculine acting way.12It would be beneficial to utilize in the exploration of the relationship between pop cultureand community; how people express themselves, what identities they share, and who theysurround themselves with are important aspects of the research topic, especially with regards tohow barriers can be placed between differing individuals when normality is questioned. I wouldsuggest it to be natural to surround oneself with comfort, to reject something considered irregularout of a fear of the unknown. Or perhaps there is a lingering reluctance to associate with theLGBTQ community out of social pressures and stigma. Labels are given to people based on theirsocial networks; a severe social disapproval of personal characteristics or beliefs that areperceived to be against cultural norms would be reason enough to create these barriers. It wouldtake courage to reach out and lend a hand regardless of perception, which in these cases were notprevalent as music and television audiences were faced with irrefutable instances of separationand alienation.Yet to ignore adverse consequences of popular culture would prove inaccurate, and thepossibility for inclusivity should be considered when dealing with such a large portion of thepopulation with media at hand. To contemplate a more constructive, inclusive representation, Iwould use Williams’ research, which acted as a supplementary piece meant to aid in the  researchon postfeminist media culture. This particular piece examined the popular reality televisionseries, Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta and how the woman characters challenged the “hegemonicpowers” within the show. The (2016) study concluded:The six women of color analyzed in this research study countered assumptions thatwomen of color are unaffected by postfeminist discourses, overtly enacting Gill’s (2007)themes and challenging postfeminist sensibilities. (p.85).13As touched on previously with the importance of role models in a contemporary setting, thesecharacters are being used to perpetuate a message for their audience. These roles are at theintersections of race, class, and gender topics; the topics brought about by that characters withinLove and Hip Hop: Atlanta has gone beyond questions of gender and sexual bias, and begin toasks questions of race and social standing as well. The show brings to light how hegemony isperpetuated by controlling images of these groups. The audience is able to see a social structureas having multiple, interlocking levels of domination that stem from the societal configuration ofrace, class, and gender.Yet how, if at all, does the LGBTQ community combat this inequality amongst groups?There are support mechanisms that can be offered only through social media and digital spheres.In Berger et al.’s study, it was concluded that:LGBTQ adolescents use social media for identity, relationships and wellbeing support.Social media is not always free of discrimination for LGBTQ adolescents. Many LGBTQparticipants joined Facebook groups to connect with LGBTQ peers. Facebook wasconsidered a vital support for those with mental health concerns including suicidalideation. Participants gave and received support from group members, which wasconsidered useful for those feeling isolated or victimized.The author is arguing that social media can create a safe space for adolescent inclusion, whichthey use to combat discrimination. With this support members of a smaller community can cometogether to support as opposed to ridicule. This can be seen on popular chat forums in whichusers can curate their own social media experience. The importance of creating an individualsocial media can be beneficial, especially when attempting to surround oneself with like minded14individuals. The responsibility then rests on the user to create a digital environment void ofhatred or negativity, creating multiple ingroups at a time. This way, groups such as these LGBTQcommunities can thrive and become important support resources.With both hate and support groups coexisting in a digital space, it can be challenging tonavigate such an environment. It is vital to focus on unique group experiences, or rather examinethe different experiences of various groups in society to bridge gaps between groups and makethe digital sphere more digestible. This encourages people to compare their experiences withthose supposedly unlike them; in this specific case, homosexuals and heterosexuals must look tofind commonality before difference. They should be able to see social structures thatsimultaneously generate unique group histories and link them together in society. Being able torecognize different groups' experiences allows you to think about changing the system, not justobserving the effects of hateful rants or offensive portrayals and lyrics.There is a danger in seeking common ground among groups however; this way ofthinking could potentially frame ones’ understanding within the context of other groups’experiences, meaning inaccurate guesses could be made about the experiences of those withinthe LGBTQ community. In the cases above, inaccuracies proved harmful, and therefore mentalleaps cannot be made when determining the experience of another. And even if difference  ismore commonly recognized, and gaps are being closed with benevolent intention, marginalizedgroups are still defined as others and treated in exclusionary ways unless action is taken. Onmeasure that can be taken would be to suggest that homosexuality should be celebrated morecommonly, -to advance the  notion that, despite their di\u0000erences, peoplewithin opposing groups arethe same regardless of sexuality.15Being able to identify the positives as well as the negatives is how this paper will aim toconstruct an image for a more fruitful path moving forward. There is inclusivity that comes withpopular culture and social media, so it would be inaccurate to assume otherwise. To simplyconcentrate on instances which exclude the LGBTQ community would not be painting the fullestpicture, its benefits need to be considered when constructing a precise conclusion.Once more, through the evidence collected and displayed, I would propose that Theperception and acceptance of the LGBTQ community can be promoted or condemned by othergroups or forces within a larger society through the use of popular culture. While there may bemore dominant forces and actors within the larger social sphere, some of which with immenseplatforms to communicate their values, it is important to recognize when our own bias leads toseparation, and how separation can lead to more extreme levels of intolerance. Different groupsmay have like minded opinions, yet choose to separate themselves from those they deemirregular or frightening.Being able to recognize your own implicit bias can be difficult, yet realizing and callingout an extreme or irrational audience in the realm of media can be even more challenging.Inclusivity will foster an environment for acceptance, and this can be achieved to a greater extentby utilizing the seemingly endless reach of popular culture that we are so familiar with tocelebrate differences,  rather than scrutinize them. Since exclusivity is inevitable in such a broadspace, inclusivity should be promoted and prioritized, and proactive steps need to be taken by theuser or audience to cut out any hateful rhetoric harmful to less influential groups within a largercommunity.16CitationsAnnati, A., Ramsey, L.R.
