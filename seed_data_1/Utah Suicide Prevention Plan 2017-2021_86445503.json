Our goal is to reduce suicide rates in Utah by 10% by 2021 with the ultimate goal of zero suicides in Utah.We dedicate this plan to those whose life has been impacted by suicidal thoughts or feelings and who bravely face each day and choose to hope and continue to live.  We also dedicate this plan to survivors who have lost a loved one to suicide and to those professionals, clinicians, first responders, individuals and families who continue to engage in this work of Suicide Prevention. Dedication 2I am pleased to share with you Utah’s Suicide Prevention Plan, the collaborative work of suicide prevention professionals, researchers, healthcare workers, advocates, survivors, family members and others affected by suicide. Unfortunately, suicide is a leading cause of death in Utah.  Each year we lose too many family members, friends and neighbors to suicide; more than breast cancer, motor vehicle accidents, homicide, and many chronic physical health problems.  The purpose of any plan is to lay out long-term and short-term goals detailing the strategies and metrics that will be used to achieve lofty goals.  We should measure our efforts, and adjust our plans and strategies accordingly. That’s the essence of the continuous quality improvement built into this plan, meant to be a living, changing, working document that adds another important element: hope.  Hope will empower individuals, families and communities to do the work laid out in this plan.  We must act together now to prevent suicide in Utah.Prevention works, treatment is effective, and people can and do recover from suicidal thoughts, feelings and behaviors. In fact, 90% of people who attempt suicide do not go on to die by suicide.  Together we can make a difference to prevent suicide, provide caring, evidenced based interventions, and foster environments that promote acceptance, healing and recovery.  With a problem as complex as suicide, no one solution will be enough.  Our health, behavioral health systems, schools and communities need to collectively work together implementing the best practices and data available to achieve our goals.I invite you to review our plan and find a way to become involved in local or statewide efforts.  Some key elements of our plan include:• Safe and Effective Messaging for Suicide Prevention with Safe Reporting of Suicide• Increasing Availability and Access to Quality Behavioral and Physical Health Care Including   Screening, Evidenced Based Interventions and Safety Planning• Coping and Problem Solving Skills• Connectedness to Individuals, Family, Community and Social Institutions• Reducing Access to Lethal Means• Support to Survivors of Suicide Loss I want to thank those who have been instrumental in moving suicide prevention work forward in Utah; those working in the field who help facilitate this process; the many caring and dedicated family members, friends and professionals, whose support is life-altering for so many. I also want to personally thank the brave individuals struggling with suicidal thoughts and encourage them to continue reaching out for hope.  As we work together collaboratively to address this problem, we will save lives and reduce the impact suicide has on individuals, families and communities in Utah. Please join us in this movement to prevent suicide in Utah.

Utah also ranks high in a number of health and happiness related outcomes.  In spite of all that Utah has to offer, Utah continually ranks in the top ten states for high suicide rates in the U.S. People in Utah also experience higher rates of associated mood disorders.  The Utah Suicide Prevention Coalition is dedicated to better understanding this paradox and implementing pre-vention, intervention and postvention strategies to decrease suicide and the associated suffering it brings. Suicide is a major preventable public health problem in Utah and the 8th leading cause of death (2010-2015 inclusive).  Every suicide death causes a ripple effect of immeasurable pain to indi-viduals, families, and communities throughout the state.  From 2009 to 2015, Utah’s age-adjusted suicide rate was 19.9 per 100,000 persons. This is an average of 525 suicide deaths per year.  Sui-cide was the second-leading cause of death for Utahns ages 10 to 39 years old in 2013 and the number one cause of death for youth ages 10-17.  Many more people attempt suicide than die by suicide.  The most recent data show that 6,039 Utahns were seen in emergency departments (2014) and 2,314 Utahns were hospitalized for self-inflicted injuries including suicide attempts (UDOH Indicator-based Information System for Public Health, 2014).  One in fifteen Utah adults report having had serious thoughts of suicide in the past year (SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2008-2009).  According to the Student Health and Risk Prevention Survey, 14.4 % of youth grades 6-12 report seriously considering suicide, 6.7% of Utah youth grades 6-12 students attempted suicide one or more times and 13.9% of students report harming themselves without the intention of dying in the prior year. While suicide is a leading cause of death and many people report thoughts of suicide, the topic is still largely met with silence and shame.  It is critical for all of us to challenge this silence using both research and personal stories of recovery.  Everyone plays a role in suicide prevention and it is up to each one of us to help create communities in which people are able to feel safe and supported in disclosing suicide risk, including mental illness and substance use problems.  We need to break down the barriers that keep people from accessing care and support for preven-tion, early intervention and crisis services.  As you review this plan, we encourage you to identify how you can implement any of the strategies and help create suicide safer communities. Introduction5Data Quality Improvement The Utah Suicide Prevention Coalition seeks to continuously improve its prevention strategies and measure proximal and distal outcomes by monitoring Utah data relating to risk and protective factors, suicide deaths, suicide attempts, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and any other available outcomes.  Local community coalitions are strongly encouraged to conduct similar data driven quality improvement, while including the voices of suicide survivors and community stakeholders in their evaluation and improvement efforts.  There are models that help support and guide communities through this data driven process.  The Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF)  developed by the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) and the Communities That Care (CTC) are complimentary models communities can use. The SPF is a planning process that guides states, jurisdictions, tribes, and communities in the selection, implementation, and evaluation of effective, culturally appropriate, and sustainable prevention activities. Overall, SPF uses findings from public health research along with evidence-based prevention programs to build capacity and sustainable prevention. CTC is a coalition-based prevention system that activates community stakeholders to collaborate on the development and implementation of a science-based community prevention system. Activating a coalition of stakeholders holds promise for coordinated, widespread change in preventive services across organizations and agencies in a community. Data6Intermountain West The Intermountain West has seven out of ten of the highest rates of suicide in the nation. Utah had the 7th highest suicide rate in the U.S. in 2014, ages 10 years and older. An average of 557 Utahns die from suicide and 4,410 Utahns attempt suicide each year.Figure 1: Map of the United States displaying suicide rankings in Intermountain WestSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention69318 47 5210Utah and the USUtah’s suicide rate has been consistently higher than the national rate for more than a decade (Figure 2). On average, two Utahns die as a result of suicide every day and twelve Utahns are treated for suicide attempts every day.  All suicide attempts should be taken seri-ously. Those who survive suicide attempts are often seriously injured and many have depres-sion and other mental health problems.Figure 2: Rate of Suicides per 100,000 Population Ages 10+ by Year, Utah and U.S., 1999-2014Source: Utah Department of Health7Age and Sex Overall, Utah males (36.0 per 100,000 population) had a significantly higher suicide rate compared to Utah females (10.6 per 100,000 population) However, Utah females had significantly higher ED visit and hospitalization rates for suicide attempts compared to Utah males.  Utah males had significantly higher rates of suicide compared to Utah females in every age group (Figure 3).Figure 3:  Rate of Suicide per 100,000 Population by Age Group and Sex, MethodsFigure 4: Percent of Suicide by Method of Injury, Ages 10+, Utah, 2012-2014Use of a firearm was the most common method of suicide deaths for Utahns followed by suffocation, then poisoning. Source: Utah Department of HealthSource: Utah Department of Health8Youth9The Utah Suicide Prevention Coalition is a partnership of community members, suicide survivors, service providers, researchers, and others dedicated to saving lives and advancing suicide prevention efforts in Utah.   The Utah Suicide Prevention Coalition has worked to create and implement the 2013 state plan and this 2017 plan in order to outline effective, evidence based strategies for promoting wellness and preventing suicide and the suffering that accompanies it.  The Utah Suicide Prevention Plan addresses suicide from a risk and protective factor model.Suicide is a complex outcome influenced by individual, family, relational, community, and societal factors.  Comprehensive prevention strategies must address the factors that increase risk for suicide and the factors that protect from suicide risk across all of these levels. The social ecological model provides a framework for this understanding. The figure below represents the National Suicide Prevention Strategy. The Utah Plan models the national plan but is not an exact replica. Risk and Protective Factors Social Ecological ModelFew available sources of supportive relationships Coping and problem solving skills Family history of suicide  Substance abuse Protective Factors Risk Factors Restrictions on lethal means of suicide Unsafe media portrayalsSources of continued care after psychiatric hospitalizationsSupportive relationship with health care providers 10The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has highlighted the following as major risk and protective factors for suicide. These factors are addressed throughout the Utah Suicide Prevention Plan:As discussed above, risk and protective factors interact in many contexts to influence an individual’s level of risk for suicide.  Unfortunately, there is limited data available concerning suicide deaths and individuals who experience suicidal behaviors and thoughts, which can make it difficult to identify subgroups in the population with an increased risk for suicide.  This plan will address efforts to improve data collection in order to better understand the problem of suicide broadly and in subgroups.  The Na-tional Action Alliance has provided guidance on groups who have been identified as higher risk for suicide behaviors than the general population.  In each of the goals and strategies outlined in the Plan, communities are encouraged to examine their data, get input from local stakeholders and focus implementation on applicable high risk popula-tions. High-risk populations identified include:• American Indians/Alaskan Natives• Individuals bereaved by suicide, also known as survivors of suicide loss • Individuals in justice and welfare settings• Individuals engaged in non-suicidal self-injury• Individuals who have attempted suicide• Individuals with medical conditions• Individuals with mental and or substance use disorders• Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+) population• Members of the Armed Forces and Veterans• Men in midlife and older men • Individuals with a history of multiple Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACES)ConnectednessContact with Caregivers Effective Behavioral Health Care Problem Solving Skills Mood DisorderPrior Suicide Attempt(s) Access to Lethal MeansSubstance AbuseProtective Factors Risk Factors Risk and Protective Factors 11Reducing risk factors and enhancing protective factors are critical components of any prevention plan.  It is not enough to focus on one risk factor, one protective factor, or one of the levels in which risk and protection exist.  Efforts must work to address as many factors in as many settings as possible and create a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention.  The goal of the Utah Suicide Prevention plan is to create a comprehensive approach and roadmap for suicide prevention in which we reach both a universal population and those with increased risk.  The plan aims to follow the comprehensive approach outlined by the Suicide Prevention Resource Center and the 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.To further increase the impact of the outlined suicide prevention strategies, the Utah Sui-cide Prevention Coalition strives to implement evidence-based programs and strategies.  An evidence-based program is one that has high evidence of effectiveness that has been proven over time and across multiple replications by independent researchers, preferably in random-ized controlled trials.  Suicide prevention is a complex and nuanced field, and some interven-tions or efforts, while well intentioned, may cause more harm than good; particularly if they raise awareness of the problem of suicide without giving adequate resources and skills to build protective factors, or if they lead to suicide contagion by normalizing or glorifying suicide unintentionally.  To facilitate the use of evidence-based programs in local Utah communities, the Utah Suicide Prevention Coalition strives to provide opportunities, resources, and training.  Fortunately, there are many evidence-based programs and strategies available, some of which can be found here: http://www.sprc.org/resources-programs.Comprehensive Approach12As mentioned previously, this suicide prevention plan addresses suicide from a risk and protective model. Reducing risk factors and enhancing protective factors are critical components of any prevention plan. Nine protective factors were identifed and are presented in the following pages as a guide for provention. Each protective factor includes goals and corresponding strategies to achieve the goals. The level of the social ecological model (SEM) is also included. Increase availability and access to quality physical and behavioral health care  Increase social norms supportive of help-seeking and recovery Reduce access to lethal means Increase connectedness to individuals, family, community and social instiutions by creating safe and supportive school and community environments Increase safe media portrayals of suicide and adoption of safe messaging principles Increase coping and problem solving skills Increase support to survivors of suicide loss Increase prevention and early intervention for mental health problems, suicide ideation and behaviors and substance misuse Increase comprehensive data collection and analysis regarding risk and protective factors for suicide to guide prevention efforts Societal CommunityInterpersonalIndividual Protective Factors Level of SEM:13Protective Factors  Increase Availability and Access to Quality Physical and Behavioral Health Care Goal 1: Promote the adoption of the ‘Zero Suicide’ framework by health and behavioral health care providers statewide.

Utah also ranks high in a number of health and happiness related outcomes. In spite of all that Utah has to offer, Utah continually ranks in the top ten states for high suicide rates in the U.S. People in Utah also experience higher rates of associated mood disorders. The Utah Suicide Prevention Coalition is dedicated to better understanding this paradox and implementing prevention, intervention and postvention strategies to decrease suicide and the associated suffering it brings.Suicide is a major preventable public health problem in Utah and the 8th leading cause of death (2010-2015 inclusive). Every suicide death causes a ripple effect of immeasurable pain to individuals, families, and communities throughout the state. From 2009 to 2015, Utah's age-adjusted suicide rate was 19.9 per 100,000 persons. This is an average of 525 suicide deaths per year. Suicide was the second-leading cause of death for Utahns ages 10 to 39 years old in 2013 and the number one cause of death for youth ages 10-17. Many more people attempt suicide than die by suicide. The most recent data show that 6,039 Utahns were seen in emergency departments (2014) and 2,314 Utahns were hospitalized for self-inflicted injuries including suicide attempts (UDOH Indicator-based Information System for Public Health, 2014). One in fifteen Utah adults report having had serious thoughts of suicide in the past year (SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2008-2009). According to the Student Health and Risk Prevention Survey, 14.4 % of youth grades 6-12 report seriously considering suicide, 6.7% of Utah youth grades 6-12 students attempted suicide one or more times and 13.9% of students report harming themselves without the intention of dying in the prior year.While suicide is a leading cause of death and many people report thoughts of suicide, the topic is still largely met with silence and shame. It is critical for all of us to challenge this silence using both research and personal stories of recovery. Everyone plays a role in suicide prevention and it is up to each one of us to help create communities in which people are able to feel safe and supported in disclosing suicide risk, including mental illness and substance use problems. We need to break down the barriers that keep people from accessing care and support for prevention, early intervention and crisis services. As you review this plan, we encourage you to identify how you can implement any of the strategies and help create suicide safer communities",
