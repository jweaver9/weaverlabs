The control group was composed of 31 cisgender womenbetween the ages of 20 and 48 years old. A standardized questionnaire was administeredto collect general patient data to better characterize the participants. The vowel /a/sounds of all participants were collected and analyzed by the Multi-Dimensional VoiceProgram advanced system.Results: Statistically significant differences between cisgender and transgender womenwere found on 14 measures: fundamental frequency, maximum fundamental frequency,minimum fundamental frequency, standard deviation of fundamental frequency,absolute jitter, percentage or relative jitter, fundamental frequency relative averageperturbation, fundamental frequency perturbation quotient, smoothed fundamentalfrequency perturbation quotient, fundamental frequency variation, absolute shimmer,relative shimmer, voice turbulence index (lower values in the cases), and soft phonationindex (higher values in the cases). The mean fundamental frequency value was159.046Hz for the cases and 192.435Hz for the controls.Conclusion: Through glottal adaptations, the group of transgender women managedto feminize their voices, presenting voices that were less aperiodic and softer than thoseof cisgender women.Keywords: voice, acoustic analysis, gender dysphoria, speech therapy, transgender (LGBT)INTRODUCTIONAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (American PsychiatricAssociation., 2013), gender dysphoria is characterized by a marked incongruence between theexperienced/expressed gender and the primary and/or secondary sexual characteristics, usuallyaccompanied by the desire tomake the body as congruent as possible with the preferred sex throughsurgery and hormonal treatment (WHO, 2004).Villas-Bôas et al. Brazilian Transgender Women’s Voices“Transgender” is a generic term that encompasses a widespectrum of people who do not identify with the sex towhich they were assigned at birth (Ansara and Hegarty,2012). For these individuals, the inconsistency between theirgender identity and the sex attributed to them at birth createsdiscomfort (Schneider et al., 2017).Psychological processes can mediate the relationship betweenminority stress and mental health, although data relating thesefactors to trans women are scarce, the degree of satisfactionof this population with their own body is directly related tomental health outcomes (Kanamor and Xu, 2020). In a studythat used a minority stress model to explore the indirect effectson the association between attacks based on transphobia andanxiety and depression through the degree of body satisfactionof a person, it was seen that body satisfaction mediated therelationship between violence based on transphobia and mentalhealth. Clinical intervention that promotes body satisfaction,including access to gender-confirming therapies, voice therapy,and especially hormonal therapy, can prevent negative mentalhealth outcomes among trans women (Klemmer et al., 2021).Acoustic voice analysis has become a primary tool to assessand quantify the vocal quality of an individual. It is frequentlyused to compare pre- and posttreatment vocal quality. TheMulti-dimensional Voice Program advanced system (MDVPA)is a software used to perform acoustic voice analysis thatquantifies the glottal source signal (Amir et al., 2009). Theparameters commonly analyzed are measures of fundamentalfrequency, frequency disturbance, amplitude disturbance, andnoise measurements (Sørensen et al., 2016). The reliability andvalidity of these analyses depend on several factors, such as themicrophone type, data acquisition system, ambient noise levels,sampling rate, software used, and quality of the collected vocalsample (Lovato et al., 2016).The frequency disturbance measurements provided by theMDVPA are Jita, Jitt, RAP, PPQ, sPPQ, and vf0. The measuresof amplitude perturbation are ShdB, Shim, APQ, sAPQ, andvAm. The noise measurements are NHR, VTI, and SPI. TheMDVPA voice wrap measures are identified through DVB andNVB. Measures of unvoiced segments are obtained by NUV andDUV, andmeasures of subharmonic components are obtained byNSH and DSH (Finger et al., 2009; Susana Finger et al., 2009).In their efforts to feminize their voice, some transgenderwomen engage in vocal compensation, such as performinglaryngeal elevation during speech (Misołek et al., 2016), makinginstinctive adaptations of the vocal tract (Schneider et al., 2017),or seeking specialized procedures potentially involving surgeryand/or speech therapy. Although an increase in fundamentalfrequency (f0) leads to a more feminine voice, a higher f0 isoften not enough for the voice to be perceived consistently asa female voice (Hoffmann et al., 2017; Schwarz et al., 2017).Studies have noted that the voice to be recognized as female needsto have a f0 between 155 and 160Hz (Spencer, 1988; Dacakis,2002); another study showed that transgender women had theirvoices recognized as feminine when their f0 was between 164and 199Hz (Gelfer and Schofield, 2000). However, both verbaland nonverbal factors arising from communication are extremelyrelevant to the new gender identity (Gray and Courey, 2019).McNeill et al. (2008) concluded that, in transgender women,satisfaction with their own voice was not directly relatedto f0 but rather to the self-perception and perception oflisteners. In a study conducted with 20 transgender women,it was found that the speakers who considered their voicesto be more feminine were judged as more feminine bylisteners, which shows the importance of exploring patients’perceptions of their own voice (Hancock et al., 2010). Inthis sense, knowing the acoustic vocal characteristics of transwomen will provide support to the professional speech therapistto develop and provide strategies for vocal feminization,in addition to modifying the f0, which help trans womento perceive themselves as female, reinforcing the desiredgender role.A previous study described aspects of perceptual–auditoryvocal analysis and the f0 of 32 transgender women and comparedthese qualities to those of 28 cisgender women without vocalcomplaints. The study concluded that transgender womenexhibited a f0 between 80 and 150Hz more frequently thancisgender women did (p = 0.003). Furthermore, transgenderwomen had hypernasal resonant focus (p < 0.001) androughness (p = 0.031) more frequently than cisgender womendid (Schwarz et al., 2017).Another study used inverse filtering of the airflow signalto indirectly assess vocal fold function in 13 transgenderwomen. The participants were asked to sustain the vowel/a/ first in her biologically male voice and then again inher female voice. The perceptual ratings of a feminine voicewere associated with a f0 of 180Hz or greater, although f0did not differ significantly between male and female voiceproduction (Gorham-Rowan and Morris, 2006).Being recognized by weavers according to their type ofexperience is essential for this population. The trans populationwants changes in all characteristics that are not congruent withtheir gender identity and expression. Voice can be considereda characteristic of gender expression, as the general populationtends to attribute gender according to what is seen and heard,that is, when a trans woman is able to feminize her voice,she feels more comfortable with her gender expression, whichcan affect factors such as self-esteem and satisfaction withherself, thus being able to ease the effects of minority stressexperienced by that population. Studies on the vocal productionof trans people are important because the voice is one ofthe fundamental elements of social recognition and genderexpression. The current study aims to compare the results ofacoustic vocal analysis of the glottal source between a groupof transsexual women and a group of cisgender women toinvestigate the differences between the vocal parameters of thetwo groups.MATERIALS AND METHODSDesignThis is a prospective case–control study. Because the presentstudy involved a database search, records with incomplete datawere excluded.Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 622526Villas-Bôas et al. Brazilian Transgender Women’s VoicesSetting and ParticipantsThe institution’s ethics committee approved this study (number14075). All participants were informed regarding the procedureand signed the informed consent prior to participating in theresearch, according to Resolution 466/12 from the NationalCommission of Ethics in Research. Data were analyzed fromsubjects in the database whose information was collected fromJanuary 2015 to July 2016.Protig is the name by which the Gender Identity Programof the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre became known. Apioneer in Brazil and created in 1998, it was one of the first spacescreated for transgender people to be entitled to the treatment ofgender claims and surgeries free of charge. The program playsan important role in assisting transgender people with genderdysphoria in Brazil. Through amultidisciplinary team, it providescare to individuals who seek clinical service in order to minimizesuffering between the incongruity of their physical characteristicswith their gender identity.The initial sample of the studies was composed of 58trans women who consulted at PROTIG/Hospital de Clínicasde Porto Alegre (HCPA), who presented with the diagnosisof gender dysphoria already established, and who acceptedthe invitation to participate in the study. The participantswere located at the PROTIG outpatient clinic and wereinvited to the research. The difference between the assistanceprovided by the service and the participation in the researchwas duly explained, which would not affect its treatmentand would be voluntary. After agreeing with and signing ofthe free and informed consent form, the participants weredirected to the Clinical Research Center. Sociodemographicdata were collected from the participants after applying theexclusion criteria (Figure 1). The sample of trans womenparticipating in the study was 30, all of whom had their voicesanalyzed. The inclusion criteria were as follows: transgenderwomen between the ages of 18 and 55 and who had notundergone surgery or speech therapy for vocal feminization. Theexclusion criteria were as follows: smoking, report of currentuse of illicit substances and alcohol in excess, hearing loss(assessed by auditory screening), report of illness that couldinterfere in the efficiency of vocal production, professionaluse of voice, voice feminization or reduction of laryngealprominence, and psychiatric or neurologic conditions thatcould interfere with the participants’ understanding of thestudy tasks. The control group was composed of 31 cisgenderwomen volunteers without pre-established vocal pathologies(Figure 1). The inclusion criteria were as follows: womenaged 18–55 years and women who self-identified as cisgender.The exclusion criteria were as follows: smoking, currentuse of illicit substances and/or self-report of alcohol abuse,hearing loss (assessed by auditory screening), disease relatedto or alterations in speech-articulatory structures that couldinterfere with the efficiency of vocal production (such asrespiratory or digestive problems), professional use of voice,speech or otorhinolaryngological treatment, and psychiatric orneurologic conditions that could interfere with the participants’understanding of the study tasks.Clinical Voice AssessmentAll volunteers completed a standardized questionnairethat included identification data, use of medications, vocalcomplaints, presence of disease that could affect the efficiencyof vocal production, professional use of voice, and previousphonotherapeutic or otorhinolaryngological treatment. In thesame questionnaire, there were two questions about vocalperception: “What do you think about your own voice?” and“What do others think of your voice?” An evaluation of thephonoarticulatory structures was carried out to assess chewingand swallowing difficulties.All transgender women had been using gender-affirminghormonal treatment for at least 9 months to up to 20 years.Two individuals reported that they self-medicated before beingfollowed up at the endocrinology team of PROTIG at the HCPA.Additionally, an auditory screening was performed with anaudiometer inside an audiometric booth using meatoscopy todiscard possible earwax plugs and/or other visually perceptibleaudiological changes, with frequencies ranging from 500 to4,000Hz in 25-dB steps (Interacoustics, Ad229). Individualswho presented with acoustic alterations were referred forcomplimentary otorhinolaryngological evaluation. A screeningof phonoarticulatory structures was also performed to rule outpossible alterations that could compromise vocal assessment,such as poorly adapted dental prostheses and substantialrespiratory changes.Acoustic AnalysisThe vocal recordings took place inside audiometric cabins withambient noise lower than 50 dB NPS, which are located at theSpeech and Hearing Unit of HCPA. A professional microphone(Behringer, ECM 8000) and a digital recorder (Zoom, H4n) wereused to record voice samples. The participants were instructedto produce a sustained vowel /a/ emission three times, with adistance of 4 cm and a 90◦ angle between the mouth and themicrophone. Five seconds of the vowel /a/ emission was used forthe acoustic analysis. The first 2 s of the beginning of the emissionwas excluded, while the analyzed recording was still ensured tobe at least 5-s long, even after the emission. The beginning ofthe emission was excluded for two reasons. First, vocal attackinterference was avoided in the data analysis (Hoffmann et al.,2017). Second, voice instabilities are typically perceived in thefirst 2 s of voice emission, which may also interfere in thedata analysis.Acoustic vocal glottic source analysis was performed usingMDVPA (Kay PENTAX R©). This software allows for theextraction of measures of acoustic voice characteristics thatenable the analysis of signal and vowel frequency: f0, f0maximum (fhi), f0 minimum (flo), standard deviation of f0(STD), absolute jitter (Jitta), percentage jitter (Jitt), relativemean of the disturbance (RAP), pitch disturbance quotient(PPQ), smoothed pitch disturbance quotient (sPPQ), variationof f0 (vf0), shimmer in dB (ShdB), percentage shimmer (Shim),amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ), smoothed amplitudeperturbation quotient (sAPQ), amplitude variation (vAm), noise-harmonic ratio (NHR), turbulence index of the voice (VTI), softphonation index (SPI), degree of vocal breaks (DVB), degree ofFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 622526Villas-Bôas et al.

All of these variables were analyzed in subsets accordingto the parameter selected, based on the fact that there is stillno exact match between a given acoustic measure and a specificcharacteristic of the phonological physiology (Gorham-Rowanand Morris, 2006; Finger et al., 2009; Janaína da Silva Berto et al.,2009; Beber and Cielo, 2010; Roman-Niehues and Cielo, 2010;Schwarz et al., 2017).For this study, f0 values of 150 to 250Hz were typicallyconsidered female, while f0 values between 80 and 150Hz weretypically considered male (Guimarães, 2003). For the othermeasures, the range of normal values proposed by the MDVPAwas used as a standard of comparison for the subjects ofboth groups.Statistical AnalysisConsidering the non-normal distribution of the extractedvariables pertaining to cisgender and transgender women’svoices, a non-parametric Mann–Whitney test and a Wilcoxontest were used to compare the mean values between groups. Thesignificance threshold was p < 0.05. Analyses were performed bycomparing the group of transsexual women with the group ofcisgender women.RESULTSThe ages of the control group ranged from 19 to 48 years, with amean age of 32.2 years (p = 0.0401). The ages of the transgendergroup ranged from 19 to 52 years, with a mean age of 34.69 yearsand an average hormonal treatment of 54months. No patient hadreceived sexual reassignment surgery.Statistically significant differences between cisgender andtranssexual women were found for f0, Fhi, Flo, STD, Jita, Jitt,RAP, PPQ, sPPQ, vf0, ShdB, Shim, VTI (lower values in thecases), and SPI (higher values in the cases) (Table 1).The questionnaire about vocal perception showed that, inrelation to the first question, 33.33% of transgender womenanswered that they like their own voice, 13.33% answered thatthey find their voices neutral, and 53.33% answered that they donot like their own voices. In relation to the second question, 60%answered that listeners think that their voices sound feminine,13.33% answered that their voices are evaluated as neutral, andFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 622526Villas-Bôas et al.

The most commonly used acoustic measures in studiesare f0, frequency and amplitude disturbance, noise, vocal tremor,voice breaks, and subharmonic components (Araújo et al., 2002).In a study with English speakers, Oates and Dacakis (Oatesand Dacakis, 1983) report an average male f0 of 128Hz, witha minimum f0 of 60Hz and a maximum of 260Hz. In femalevoices, the average f0 is 227Hz, with a minimum f0 of 128Hz,a maximum f0 of 520Hz, and an ambiguous gender range from128 to 260Hz. A study carried out in a Portuguese-speakingBrazilian population concluded that f0 values from 150 to 250Hzwere considered to be typically female, while f0 values between80 and 150Hz were considered to be typically male (Guimarães,2003). A study carried out in China with Cantonese speakerswho had their gender analyzed by means of vocal samplesshowed that there was 75% correct gender identificationat 162.01 and 204.97Hz for male and female stimuli,respectively (Poon and Ng, 2014).The mean f0 found in the case group was 159Hz, which waslower than that in the control group but within the f0 rangeconsidered to constitute female vocal standards. It should betaken into account that the case group in the present study didnot receive speech therapy or surgical interventions involvingthe larynx, so this elevation of f0 reaching the female rangewas obtained by means of instinctive adaptations or favorableanatomy (Ansara and Hegarty, 2012; Oates and Dacakis, 2015;Misołek et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2017) (Table 1). Thisfactor may also be related to body size (Leung et al., 2018)and more feminine facial characteristics (Misołek et al., 2016).Self-performed adaptations by transgender women should bestimulated more systematically and technically correctly by voiceprofessionals since they are not muscular adaptations that causeFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 622526Villas-Bôas et al. Brazilian Transgender Women’s Voicesoverload to the speech apparatus, as not all adaptations arehealthy from a physiological point of view (Dacakis, 2002).Noise measures report altered voices. The main measures areNHR, SPI, VTI, SPI, and HNR (Beber and Cielo, 2010). In thepresent study, the SPI was found to be within the normal rangefor both groups (Table 1). However, the SPI value of the cases wasgreater than that of the controls. The SPI measure indicates noiseat high frequencies, possibly related to breathiness (Gonzálezet al., 2002), which may be a factor present in the voices of cases(but not controls) caused by attempts at feminization involvingthe use of breath to soften the male emission.A previous study was carried out to evaluate the contributionof VTI and SPI acoustic parameters to vocal evaluation throughthe GRBASI scale in a group of 94 cisgender women and menwith and without vocal complaints and who were between 19and 81 years old. It was observed that the higher the VTI valuewas, the greater the general degree of vocal deviation, roughness,and tension. In relation to SPI, the higher the breathiness was,the lower the tension (Galdino de et al., 2013). The SPI measureindicates noise at high frequencies, possibly related to breathiness(González et al., 2002; Karlsen et al., 2020), which may be afactor present in the voices of cases (but not controls) causedby attempts at feminization involving the use of breath to softenthe male emission. On the other hand, the SPI result confirmsdata from the literature suggesting that the measure is sensitiveto soft closure of the vocal folds (Galdino de et al., 2013).Considering that, in the present study, VTI was higher in thecontrol group and SPI was higher in the case group, we canhypothesize that the voices of cisgender women present greaternoise due to turbulence (VTI) than the voices of transsexualwomen do. The difference is most likely justified by transgenderwomen’s increased breathiness/softness (SPI) compared to thatof cisgender women’s voices (Table 1).In a study aiming to investigate the acoustic differencesbetween the voices of a control group and a group of patientspresenting different types of pathologies of the larynx, it wasfound that the mean NHR of the control group was 0.14%, whilethat of patients with laryngeal pathologies varied from 0.18 to0.22%, depending on the pathology in question (González et al.,2002). In a study conducted with groups of choral singers andnon-singers, higher NHR values were found in the group of non-singers (0.07%) than in the group of singers (0.04%) (Ravi et al.,2019). Given that the high end of the normal range for NHR inthe MDVPA is 0.190%, the NHR values obtained in the presentstudy (0.140% for cases and 0.142% for controls), which showedno significant difference between groups, are within the normalrange. Only one previous study highlighted the NHR as the leastreliable variable of the program in question (Leong et al., 2013).One study suggested the following normal standard valuesfor voices of male subjects without vocal pathologies: Jitt,0.66%; RAP, 0.37%; Shim, 3.23%; APQ, 2.59%; VTI, 0.06%; andSPI, 8.88% (Sørensen et al., 2016). In the present study, thegroup of transgender women, whose vocal anatomy is male,showed average values closer to male than to female standardvalues (Table 1). Furthermore, the mean values for the acousticmeasures of the case group were higher than those of the normalMDVPA range for males for the variables STD, vf0, shdB, shim,sAPQ, vAm, DSH, DUV, and NSH and higher than the reportedfemale range values in the previously cited study.While the cycle-to-cycle frequency disturbance is called jitter,the disturbance of the cycle-to-cycle amplitude of a vocal sampleis called shimmer (Beber and Cielo, 2010). The present studyshowed higher Jitt, RAP, PPQ, and sPPQ in the controls,with jitter being higher in the control group than in thetransgender women group. The ShdB, Shim, APQ, sAPQ, andvAm measurements were related to shimmer and were alsohigher in the control and case groups, but shimmer was higherin the control group than in the case group. Considering thatthe shimmer demonstrates phonatory stability and that its highvalues reflect greater noise in the emission, that is, breathy voices(Carvalho-Teles and Rosinha, 2008), it can be concluded thatboth groups present breathiness in the voice. However, it wasobserved that in both groups the ShdB, Shim, sAPQ, and vAmmeasurements were above the normal MDVPA range and that inthe controls the APQ measurement also exceeded this limit.In other words, all jitter and shimmer values in the controlgroup were higher than those in the transgender women, andall shimmer values were above the normal range of MDVPA forboth groups (Table 1). These results indicate the alteration of theglottic signal for both cases and controls, suggesting aperiodicityin both groups and a higher breathiness index (shimmermeasurements) in the controls than in the cases. However, thecases also presented with breathiness, a fact reinforced by the SPI.In contrast to previous reports (Finger et al., 2009), the voices ofcisgender women had greater aperiodicity (jitter and shimmer)than the transgender women’s voices did.In a study carried out on 35 adult euphonic individuals,including 24 women and 11men, with the objective of measuringshimmer parameters, it was shown that the women had thefollowing values: Shim = 2.22%; APQ = 1.75%; sAPQ = 3.30%;vAm = 7.04%. The observed values for male voices were asfollows: Shim = 2,892%; APQ = 2.61; sAPQ% = 3.43; vAm =6.38% (Oates and Dacakis, 2015). In the present study, for thesame variablesmentioned above, the controls and cases presentedthe following values: Shim = 4.57%; APQ = 3.16%; sAPQ =5.93%; vAm= 21.745% and Shim= 4.14%; APQ= 2.93%; sAPQ= 5,425%; vAm = 17.667%, respectively. Taking into accountthat euphonic individuals are those who present a voice withoutalterations (Nicastri et al., 2004), we can affirm that, on average,the voices of both the cases and the controls in the present studyare altered compared to those in the cited study. It should alsobe considered that the APQ of the group of cases was closer tothe APQ value of the male group, evidencing similarity in thismeasure of shimmer between the transgender women’s voicesand the cisgender men’s voices.Part of the case group of the present study participated ina study in 2017 in which they answered the transsexual voicequestionnaire for male-to-female transsexual. The questionnaireincluded aspects of vocal satisfaction and how the voiceinterfered with personal and professional relationships, suchas discrimination. Most participants had low scores. However,many experienced stress because they were perceived as theopposite gender or demonstrated dissatisfaction with their voice(Schwarz et al., 2016).Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 May 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 622526Villas-Bôas et al. Brazilian Transgender Women’s VoicesInternalized transphobia is an individual form of minoritystress that occurs when trans people develop negative perceptionsof themselves in response to repeated exposure to social stigmaagainst trans people and is directly linked to the poor mentalhealth of that population (Testa et al., 2015; Staples et al., 2018).A study conducted with a population of Korean trans menand women showed that Korean transgender adults face similarpublic health concerns such as high prevalence of depressivesymptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts, which weredirectly correlated with internalized transphobia experienced bythis population (Lee et al., 2020). So, a voice consistent with thegender experienced can reduce the stigma imposed by society ona trans woman, which can be beneficial for the mental health ofthis population.CONCLUSIONBased on the results obtained in the present study, it wasconcluded that transgender women perform vocal adaptationsthat interfere with their vocal production. This finding suggeststhat transgender women have lowest f0 and less aperiodic andsofter voices than cisgender women have.This suggests that, throughout their lives, they makemuscular adaptations and speech projections that result in voicesthat sound feminine without necessarily undergoing surgicalinterventions and speech therapy.The objective vocal characteristics found are also relevant tounderstand and help trans women to achieve vocal passabilitynot based only on f0. For many trans women, vocal feminizationwith change of f0 is very difficult or is not possible for anatomo-physiological reasons. Thus, through adaptations and vocalmalleability andwithout surgical interventions, the studied groupobtained vocal identification congruent with the experiencedgender expression, even with a lower f0 than the controls, whichincreases their social passability and self-esteem.Study LimitationsBecause the study was conducted only with Brazilian Portuguese-speaking individuals, there are cultural differences in vocal rangesthat are learned and imprinted early in life, and this type ofanalysis is difficult to translate across different languages andcultures. Even though they are not voice professionals, a largepart of the sample in the control group was composed of peoplewho use their voice a lot throughout the day, which may haveinterfered with the parameters found in this group. Studies on thevocal production of trans people are important because the voiceprovides objective measures in relation to the characteristicsthat differ between the genders, constituting itself as one of thefundamental elements of social recognition.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTThe original contributions generated for the study are includedin the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can bedirected to the corresponding author/s.ETHICS STATEMENTThe studies involving human participants were reviewed andapproved by Comitê de Ética em Pesquisa doHospital de Clínicasde Porto Alegre.

    "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to compare the acoustic vocal analysis results of a group of transgender women relative to those of cisgender women. Methods: Thirty transgender women between the ages of 19 and 52 years old participated in the study. The control group was composed of 31 cisgender women between the ages of 20 and 48 years old. A standardized questionnaire was administered to collect general patient data to better characterize the participants. The vowel /a/ sounds of all participants were collected and analyzed by the Multi-Dimensional Voice Program advanced system. Results: Statistically significant differences between cisgender and transgender women were found on 14 measures: fundamental frequency, maximum fundamental frequency, minimum fundamental frequency, standard deviation of fundamental frequency, absolute jitter, percentage or relative jitter, fundamental frequency relative average perturbation, fundamental frequency perturbation quotient, smoothed fundamental frequency perturbation quotient, fundamental frequency variation, absolute shimmer, relative shimmer, voice turbulence index (lower values in the cases), and soft phonation index (higher values in the cases). The mean fundamental frequency value was 159.046 Hz for the cases and 192.435 Hz for the controls. Conclusion: Through glottal adaptations, the group of transgender women managed to feminize their voices, presenting voices that were less aperiodic and softer than those of cisgender women",
