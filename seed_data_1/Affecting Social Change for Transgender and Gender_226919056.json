We get into the \nwork because we're somewhat touched by it, broken by it, and need to heal in some way, shape, \nor form. And that was certainly a part of it for me.” – Participant Amanda \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  1 \n \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction \nStatement of the Problem \n“Indeed, we can argue that no one achieves autonomy without the assistance or support of a \ncommunity, especially if one is to make a brave and difficult choice such as transitioning” \n(Butler, 2004, p. 76) \nDefining Gender  \nGender consists of three primary components: Identity, body, and expression. Identity \nrefers to one’s “deeply held, internal sense of self as male, female, a blend of both, or neither” \n(“The Gender Spectrum”, 2018), while the bodily aspect of gender attends to one’s experience in \ntheir body, and how society “genders” their body. The expression of gender is how one presents \ntheir gender to others, and how society, community, and family may attempt to shape or \ninfluence one’s gender (“The Gender Spectrum”, 2018). Forces within society, one’s \ncommunity, and the school environment may either reinforce oppressive social norms about \ngender, or support and affirm gender-variant identities, and advocate for social change. \nTransgender and gender-expansive youth self-identify their gender as early as three years \nof age (Lopez, Stewart, & Jacobson-Dickman, 2016), and express their gender identity in a \nvariety of ways. Young children may articulate their transgender identity and expression verbally \nor behaviorally by indicating a preference for dressing like the gender with which they identify, \npreferring playmates of the gender with which they identify, expressing a strong dislike for their \nsexual anatomy, and exhibiting a desire for sex characteristics of their (use of gender pronoun \nintentional) identified gender (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). When compared to \nchildren merely exploring gender identity and expression, the experience of children who \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  2 \n \nidentify as transgender is distinct, as transgender children consistently, insistently, and \npersistently describe their gender identity as that which does not align with the sex they were \nassigned at birth (Zucker, 2005). While persons who are transgender often identify with one of \nthe binary genders (e.g. male or female), both transgender and gender-expansive individuals may \ndescribe their gender identity as both male and female genders, neither male nor female, or may \ndescribe their identity in their own unique terms (The Gender Spectrum, 2018). In other words, \nthe meaning assigned to the terms transgender and gender-expansive are specific to the \nindividual who uses this term to describe their identity, and the definitions provided in this \nmanuscript may not be accurate for all transgender and gender-expansive individuals. \nAffirming Gender & Contrasting Perspectives \nThe medical community and mental health professions conceptualize transgender and \ngender-expansive identities as a normative part of human development (Stein, 2017; Association \nof Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues in Counseling, 2009), and “not inherently \npathological” (American Psychological Association, 2015, p. 835). The Association of Lesbian, \nGay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues in Counseling (ALGBTIC) (2009), a branch of the \nAmerican Counseling Association (ACA), provides helping professionals with competencies for \ncounseling with transgender and gender-expansive clients. The ALGBTIC (2009) competencies \narticulate an affirmative approach to working with this population. The ACA also provides \ncontinuing education courses to ensure competent practice in addressing the needs of these \nindividuals. The American Psychological Association endorses the Gender Affirmative Model, a \nbest practices approach to working with transgender and gender-expansive youth that supports \nand affirms these individuals’ right to live as their authentic selves (Keo-Meier & Ehrensaft, \n2018).  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  3 \n \n Although these foundational professional organizations publicly support and affirm \ntransgender and gender-expansive identities, non-evidence based “reparative” and “conversion” \ntherapies are still practiced by helping professionals in the United States. Professionals practicing \nthis form of therapy aim to alter transgender person’s identity to align with the sex assigned at \nbirth. As of March 2018, the practice of reparative and conversion therapy with youth under the \nage of eighteen is banned in nine states (Movement Advancement Project, 2018). The methods \nassociated with conversion therapy promote and reinforce client self-hatred, and have been \nassociated with increases in client suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, and genital mutilation \n(Hicks, 1999). Despite the rejection of this mode of therapy, reparative therapy is still practiced \nby licensed therapists and endorsed by organizations such as Positive Approaches to Healthy \nSexuality (PATH, formerly known as Positive Alternatives to Homosexuality) and the Alliance \nfor Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity. \nMarginalization, Discrimination & Politicization at the Individual and Systems Levels \nIn spite of the consensus of foundational institutions regarding the unethical nature of \n“conversion” and “reparative” therapy, and the validity of transgender and gender-expansive \nidentities, the American public remains divided on whether transgender persons’ gender identity \nis enough to allow access to the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. According to \nthe New York Times/CBS poll, 46% percent of the general public “say they think that \ntransgender people should be allowed to use only public restrooms corresponding to their gender \nat birth”, while 41% state that transgender persons should be able to utilize the facilities of the \ngender with which they identify (Thee-Brenan, 2016).  \nTransgender youth are experiencing discrimination as a result of the highly-politicized \nbathroom issue, with multiple publicized examples of transgender K-12 students who previously \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  4 \n \nwere able to utilize the facilities of the gender with which they identify, suddenly informed by \ntheir school district administration that new school policy requires them to use the restroom that \naligns with the sex listed on their birth certificate. The families of several of these students have \nentered litigation with the school districts, arguing that such bathroom policies are \n“unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and violate Title IX of the U.S. Education \nAmendments of 1972” (American Civil Liberties Union, 2017). Both in the public arena and \nschool environment, transgender and gender-expansive youth experience the stigma assigned to \npersons whose gender does not align with the binary identities of male or female. \nDiscrimination in schools is evident in more than bathroom policy. School anti-bullying \nprotocols tend to focus on general acts of aggression, and fail to address the unique aspects of \ngendered and transphobic harassment (Meyer, 2009). The adverse consequences of school \nadministration’s failure to incorporate adequate interventions for addressing gendered \nharassment is evident in the GLSEN National School Climate Survey findings. According to the \nsurvey, 56.4% of students report frequently hearing negative and transphobic comments from \nfellow students, with 42.3% of students stating that teachers or staff failed to intervene when \nthey were present for such derogatory remarks (Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, and Boesen, 2014). \nUnaddressed gendered harassment in schools directly affectss students educational experience. \nStudents who experienced Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) discrimination in \nthe school environment were:  \nMore than three times as likely to have missed school in the past month as those who had \nnot (42.3% vs. 13.8%); have lower GPAs than their peers (3.0 vs. 3.3); and have lower \nself-esteem and higher levels of depression (Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, and Boesen, 2014, \np. 20). \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  5 \n \n Reflecting on the results of the GLSEN school climate survey, Kosciw, Greytak, Giga, \nVillenas, and Danischewski (2016) call for family members, educators, and community members \nof Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) youth to advocate for anti-bullying \npolicies, and school policy that protects LGBTQ youth and ensures equal access to a safe \neducational environment conducive to learning. The role of advocates is critical in addressing the \ndiscrimination these youth face, as their efforts challenge discriminatory beliefs and policies, and \noppressive behavior. The pervasive nature of discriminatory beliefs and attitudes towards \nLGBTQ persons, particularly those who are transgender or gender-expansive, influences this \ngroups’ experience in numerous other contexts outside of the school environment.  \nThe Effects of Marginalization, Stigmatization & Politicization  \nYoung people who fail to fit within the male or female gender binary often experience a \n“radical dislocation” from society (Butler, 1986, p. 27). Transgender and gender-expansive youth \nexperience additional barriers when presenting as their authentic selves, as they experience \nhigher rates of stressful childhood experiences (Schneeberger et al., 2014; Grossman & \nD’Augelli, 2006), verbal and physical violence within the school environment (Kosciw, Diaz & \nGreytak, 2010), and discrimination throughout the lifespan (Schneeberger et al., 2014).  In the \nhealthcare setting, gender-expansive and transgender youth experience discrimination in the \nform of physician’s refusal to provide medical services necessary for gender transition, and \nhealth insurance refusal to pay for gender transition related services (Safer et al., 2016).  \nTransgender and gender-expansive youth experience the stigmatization of their gender \nidentity in the public arena, school environment, and within institutions responsible for medical \nand mental health care. Youth facing discrimination experience additional disadvantage, as their \nstatus as minors often prevents them from engaging in self-advocacy without parent/caregiver \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  6 \n \nsupport. One example of this dilemma is the district policy of Rio Rancho Public Schools \n(RRPS), a school district in the Southwest United States. Rio Rancho Public Schools requires \nparents/caregivers of transgender and gender-expansive students to meet with school \nadministration before school personnel will: 1) acknowledge the child using appropriate \npronouns, and “preferred” name, and 2) allow the child to access the facilities (e.g. restrooms, \nlocker or changing facilities) of the gender with which they identify (T. Burgos, December 1, \n2016). Thus transgender and gender-expansive youth may be unable to achieve basic recognition \nof their gender identity in environments such as school without the support and advocacy efforts \nof parents/caregivers.  \nAddressing Marginalization, Discrimination & Politicization: The Role of Advocacy \nTransgender and gender-expansive youth may face challenges that require advocacy \nefforts beyond that available from supportive and affirming parents/caregivers. Social service \nand healthcare clinicians may serve as advocates, helping transgender and gender-expansive \nyouth and their loved ones to navigate institutions such as healthcare, and mental health services. \nCommunity advocates (also referenced in this manuscript as community-based advocates) may \nconnect these young people with affirming social service clinicians and healthcare providers, \nprovide information about additional resources, and provide guidance regarding methods of \naddressing barriers to services. Individuals in a variety of settings, from counselors to healthcare \nprofessionals, may engage in efforts to support and affirm transgender and gender-expansive \nyouth, using their own resources to promote positive change for this population (Holman & \nGoldberg, 2006). It is the efforts of advocates that shed light on sources of discrimination, and \nwork to diminish the adverse experiences of transgender and gender-expansive youth.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  7 \n \nThis manuscript aims to explore the experiences of adult advocates for transgender and \ngender-expansive youth, specifically young people ages 4-12 years, to illuminate how these \nadvocates pursue social change for this population. The discrimination, barriers to services, and \nsocial stigma faced by transgender and gender-expansive youth has dire lifelong consequences \n(Institute of Medicine, 2011). Advocates for this population act as instruments of change, as their \nefforts work to diminish the experiences and effects of discrimination and empower transgender \nand gender-expansive young people. The purpose of this study is to utilize interpretive case \nstudy (Merriam, 1988) to provide readers with a rich description of how advocates address \nsources of oppression and pursue social change for transgender and gender-expansive youth.  \nPurpose of the Study \n“Nothing about us without us” (Charlton, 1998) \nWhy Advocacy? Why Now? \nAlthough there is a growing body of research concerning the role of counselors (Kiselica \n& Robinson, 2001), psychologists and other mental health professionals (Edwards-Leeper, \nLeibowitz & Sangganjanavanich, 2016), and parents/caregivers (Ryan, 2009; 2014) in \nempowering and advocating for social change for transgender and gender-expansive youth, there \nis a distinct lack of qualitative literature regarding the experience of advocates and the context \nsurrounding their efforts. This study contributes a unique perspective to the existing literature by \nexploring the personal and professional experience of advocates as they pursue positive social \nchange for gender-expansive children. Advocates will include helping professionals such as \nlicensed social workers, counselors, and psychologists, as well as educators, and community-\nbased advocates who work with or on behalf of transgender and gender-expansive youth in their \nlocal area to address discriminatory practices, reduce barriers to resources, and empower the \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  8 \n \nindividual. These advocates may attend to both systems-level variables (e.g. discriminatory \npractices at a child’s school that prevent the child from utilizing the facilities of the gender with \nwhich they identify) as well as individual concerns (e.g. a child would like to address emotional \ndistress related to lack of congruence between current physical presentation and gender identity) \n(Singh, 2010).  \nThe core phenomenon or “unit of analysis” (Baxter & Jack, 2008, p. 545) explored in this \nproject is the process of advocating, which includes those efforts which aim to elevate the voices \nof transgender and gender-expansive youth (ages 4-12 years). The interpretive case study \nresearch design best fits this phenomenon, as the process of advocating for this population is \nbounded by contextual variables (Johansson, 2003), to include: Time (relative to history, current \nevents, and political context), space (geographic location, and surrounding community), \nparticipant’s demographic characteristics, and each participant’s unique approach to advocacy.  \nThis study includes participants from across the United States (US) and occurs in the year \n2018, two years into the presidency of Republican Donald Trump. The current U.S. government \nadministration has promoted policies that directly impact the lives of transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth, from the recension of the Department of Justice Title IX guidance that specifies \nthe inclusion of transgender and gender-expansive students as a protected population, to the \nSupreme Court’s failure to hear the case of Gavin Grimm—a high school student whose school \ndenied him access to their male facilities due to his transgender identity. Advocacy efforts play \nan essential role in reducing the vulnerability of transgender and gender-expansive youth \n(Grossman & D’augelli, 2006). Considering the critical need for advocacy in the current political \nand social climate, now is the time to explore and interpret the process of advocacy for this \npopulation, and the context in which this process is embedded. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  9 \n \nTransgender and gender-expansive children are at the front lines of a revolutionary shift \nin American culture as their very existence and visibility challenges one of the country’s \nstrongest cultural beliefs, that gender and sex are synonymous and have only two binary \nidentities, male or female. Advocates sustain this revolution by sharing their stories, pursuing \nsocial change, and supporting the next generation of gender-expansive individuals (Stryker, \n2017). This study aims to explore how advocates who work to elevate the voices of transgender \nand gender-expansive youth pursue social change for this population. Merriam’s (1988; 1998) \napproach to interpretive case study was utilized as the research design, guiding data collection \nand data analysis, with themes and concepts emerging from the review of each participant’s case, \nfollowed by comparison of themes and concepts across cases. \nSignificance of the Study \nStudy Context & Relationship with Current Literature  \nNumerous texts are advertised as the essential “hand book” for educating caregivers and \nadvocates about the gender identity development of gender-expansive children and how to \nsupport them in their journey. Texts such as Brill and Pepper’s (2008) The Transgender Child: A \nHandbook for Families and Professionals assists caregivers and advocates to determine whether \na child is transgender, and discusses the role of family and community acceptance, and affirming \nparenting strategies in these children’s health and wellbeing.  \nThe handbook, which is recommended by a multitude of national advocacy organizations \n(i.e. Genderspectrum.org, Human Rights Campaign’s Welcoming Schools Initiative), provides \nsome suggestions for advocating for gender-expansive youth. These portions of the text include a \ndiscussion of school-based advocacy, encouraging advocates to help supportive caregivers of \ngender-expansive youth to: Seek trans-inclusive changes in policy, update their child’s \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  10 \n \nidentifying information to ensure preferred name and pronouns are honored and privacy \nmaintained, and educate school staff and other parents about transgender identity (Brill & \nPepper, 2008). Although this handbook provides an overview of the practical advocacy \ninterventions, the text is geared more towards families and caregivers who are unfamiliar with \nthe transgender or LGBTQ community.  \nBrill and Pepper’s (2008) text provides pragmatic guidance in layman’s terms and fails to \nprovide guidance or insight concerning systems-level advocacy. A comprehensive model of \nadvocacy for this population must include references to systems-level advocacy, as community-\nbased advocates, helping professionals, and parent/caregiver(s) often confront systems-level \nsources of oppression that exist within institutions. The primary association for the counseling \nprofession has endorsed a conceptual model that goes beyond Brill and Pepper’s (2008) \npragmatic guidance for supporting gender-expansive youth, and describes advocacy as occurring \nwithin a multitude of arenas and at both the micro and macro levels. \nThe American Counseling Association (ACA) Advocacy Competencies provide a \nconceptual model for understanding the multiple levels and domains in which advocacy efforts \ncan occur (Lewis, Arnold, House & Toporek, 2003). The approaches to advocacy described in \nthis model seem to parallel the work of a variety of advocates, from those working at a \ncommunity level, to helping professionals, and educators. No matter their profession or field, \nthose individuals who act with or on behalf of gender-expansive children work towards the \ncommon goal of promoting the child’s wellbeing. The similarities in advocate’s efforts seem to \nallow the application of the ACA Advocacy Competencies Model as a means of conceptualizing \nadvocacy efforts, even though this model was originally developed to explain the advocacy \nefforts of counseling professionals.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  11 \n \nThe Multicultural and Social Justice Counseling Competencies (Ratts, Singh, Nassar-\nMcMillan, Butler & McCullough, 2015) further describe those counseling interventions and \nadvocacy efforts that enable social justice work at multiple levels. These competencies outline \nthe attitudes and beliefs, knowledge, skills, and actions that inform social justice counseling. \nCounselors practicing from a social justice perspective know when to engage in systems \nadvocacy, to assist a client to develop self-advocacy skills, and when to “address the historical \nevents and persons that shape and influence privileged and marginalized client’s developmental \nhistory” (p. 12). These competencies outline the many ways that counselors can affect positive \nchange through their privileged role as helping professionals. These competencies also contribute \nto the overall conceptualization of advocacy efforts for marginalized populations. \nAnother essential organizing framework for understanding the advocacy process comes \nfrom the counseling literature. Recent counseling literature explores professional counselor’s \nrole as advocates for disenfranchised, stigmatized, and marginalized populations (Kress & Paylo, \n2012). Within the therapeutic setting, counselors work one on one with clients to identify sources \nof oppression and discrimination, and brainstorm ways to diminish the effects of marginalization \nthrough empowerment and social action (Kress & Paylo, 2012). Effective counselors are \nexpected to engage in advocacy efforts with, and on behalf of their clients. Per the ACA Code of \nEthics (2014): \nCounselors are expected to advocate to promote changes at the individual, group, \n institutional, and societal levels that improve the quality of life for individuals and groups \n and remove potential barriers to the provision or access of appropriate services being \n offered (p. 8) \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  12 \n \nCounselors fulfill the role of advocate in order to address those environmental variables \nthat impact client’s ability to achieve their goals, develop across the lifespan, and access \nresources (Brubaker & Goodman, 2012). Counselors who effectively advocate for their clients \nare described as maintaining the following characteristics: 1) an appreciation for the suffering of \nothers, 2) the ability to effectively communicate verbally and non-verbally, 3) maintaining a \nmultisystemic perspective, 4) maintaining competence in individual, group, and systems-level \ninterventions, 5) understanding how to effectively use technology and media, and 6) having \nadequate research skills and abilities (Kiselica & Robinson, 2001).  \nAdvocacy competencies and related skills and abilities are cultivated in counselors-in-\ntraining during their Masters-level educational programs. Counselor education programs are \nrequired by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs \n(CACREP)—the primary accrediting body for counselor education programs—2016 standards to \ntrain counselors to engage in advocacy efforts. Specifically, these standards indicate that \ncurriculum in counselor preparation programs must address “2.F.e. advocacy processes needed to \naddress institutional and social barriers that impede access, equity, and success for clients” \n(CACREP, 2016, pg. 10). Per these standards, counselors-in-training who specialize in mental \nhealth, school, career, or rehabilitation counseling are required to receive further training in the \nadvocacy needs of the specific populations with which they plan to work (CACREP, 2016). \nSensitizing Concepts \nThe counseling literature, coupled with Brill and Pepper’s (2008) text and Lewis, Arnold, \nHouse and Toporek’s (2003) Advocacy Competencies, and the literature outlined in chapter 2 of \nthis manuscript, act as essential sensitizing concepts for this research study, providing “a starting \npoint in thinking about a class of data in which the social researcher has no definite idea and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  13 \n \nprovides an initial guide to her research” (Van den Hoonard, 1997, p. 2). Chapter 3 provides a \nsummative list of sensitizing concepts and categories borrowed from the literature that act as a \nconceptual lens through which to view the data. As a researcher, counselor, educator, and parent-\nadvocate for my eight year old gender-expansive daughter, I have utilized the aforementioned \nliterature as a means of informing my own advocacy efforts with clients, and for my child. As \nsensitizing concepts, these resources also informed the creation of interview questions, and my \ninitial conceptualization of the advocacy process. The breadth and depth of counseling literature \nregarding counselor advocacy lead me to create a more detailed interview protocol for study \nparticipants who are helping professionals (see appendix 2 for Interview Protocol for Advocates, \nappendix 1 for Interview Protocol for Helping Professionals). The interview questions for these \nparticipants are similar to those questions posed to other advocates, but include additional \nquestions regarding specific concepts described in the counseling-advocacy literature. Although \ninformed by counseling literature, this protocol will be used for helping professionals from all \nbackgrounds (e.g. counselors, social workers, psychologists). \nThe current literature on the process of advocacy, which is further discussed in chapter \ntwo of this manuscript, is based primarily on: Models outlining a social justice and advocacy \napproach to supporting transgender and gender-expansive youth in schools; the special needs of \ngender-expansive and transgender youth in the school environment; the role of family in the \nhealth and wellbeing of this population; and the role of mental health counselors in empowering \nand advocating on behalf of transgender and gender-expansive youth. Although the current \nliterature elucidates a myriad of perspectives and provides critical guidance for advocates \nseeking to support this population, current research fails to attend to the process of advocacy for \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  14 \n \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth within the context of advocate’s lived experience, and \nthe political and social context. \nThe significance of this study lies in it’s unique contribution to the field of human \nservices, as the goal of this project is to provide persons involved in human services with an \nincreased understanding of how the advocacy process works, and the contextual variables that \ninfluence this process. Human services is broadly defined as those individuals who work in a \nhelping capacity (e.g. helping professionals, community advocates, healthcare professionals, \neducators), interacting directly or indirectly with individuals, working to elevate the voices of \ndisenfranchised and marginalized populations. My intention was to illuminate aspects of the \nprocess of advocacy, and the context in which these acts are embedded, in order to provide \nhuman service professionals with insight regarding the advocacy process. This study elicited the \nperspectives of advocates who have, and/or are currently pursuing social change for transgender \nand gender-expansive youth. Each participant’s perspective and self-reported demographic \ninformation were analyzed to identify themes within each case, then compared to other cases to \ndetermine shared or contrasting categories. Categories consist of overarching themes or concepts \nthat include multiple factors. Results will provide human service providers with a holistic \nunderstanding of the advocacy process and context. \nAdvocates from a variety of backgrounds (e.g. educators, community members, helping \nprofessionals) engaged in an audio-recorded interview lasting approximately one hour, during \nwhich they were asked a series of questions regarding their advocacy efforts, and asked to \nrecommend any pertinent advocacy-related artifacts (e.g. articles, books, videos, movies, \ndocumentaries). Participants also completed a brief demographic questionnaire. Participants \nwere provided the opportunity to review their transcripts, and engage in a second interview to \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  15 \n \nprovide feedback about their transcript or expound upon previous disclosures. Interviews were \ntranscribed and analyzed using Merriam’s (1988; 1998) interpretive case study design. Data for \neach participant underwent intensive analysis with the goal of generating categories for each \nindividual participant that capture the essence of the participant’s experience (Merriam, 1988). \nCross-case analysis was also utilized to explore common and contrasting categories between \nparticipants.  The final write-up of results followed a case study format, with descriptive \nindividual case studies or “portraits” (Lightfoot, 1983) provided for each participant, followed by \nan explanation of results derived from the cross-case analysis (Merriam, 1988). The use of case \nstudy design for the collection of data, data analysis, and write-up of results ensured \nmethodological congruence, and provided readers with a holistic conceptualization of the \nadvocacy process. \nResearch Questions \nThe primary questions examined through this interpretive case study design are:  \n1) How do advocates pursue positive change at the individual and systems levels for \ntransgender and gender-expansive children (ages 4 to 12)?  \nSecondary questions include: \n2) What contextual variables have influenced advocate’s ability to advocate for \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth? \nDefinitions \n Language is ever evolving, as persons along the LGBTQ spectrum name their experience \nthrough the development of new terms. The development of affirming language that describes \nthe experience of gender-expansive individuals is in and of itself a continual act of self-\nadvocacy. Examples of affirming language include the phrase “gender confirmation surgery” to \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  16 \n \ndescribe what was formerly referred to as “gender reassignment surgery.” The new evolution of \nthe title speaks to the use of a medical intervention to confirm one’s gender identity, rather than \n“reassign” it. Another example includes referencing one’s pronouns as one’s “pronouns” rather \nthan “preferred pronouns”. The previous inclusion of the term “preferred” seemed to imply that \none’s gender identity is a preference rather than an inborn trait, thus the removal of the term \n“preferred” reinforces the understanding that one’s gender and associated pronouns are part of \none’s inborn identity (Stryker, 2017). \n The following section provides general definitions for those terms and concepts \nreferenced in this manuscript. At the time of this writing, these terms are considered the most \ncurrent and non-pejorative. Multiple national organizations maintain web-based glossaries of \nterms related to LGBTQ identity that are consistently updated. Interested readers may access \nthese lists through the Trevor Project (2017a) the Human Rights Campaign (2017), and the \nGender Spectrum (2018) online data bases. \nAdvocacy: “A continuum of counseling action ranging from empowerment to social…that tend \nto focus on…assisting clients in recognizing and addressing sociopolitical barriers to well-being” \n(Toporek, Lewis & Crethar, 2009, p. 262) \nAdvocacy competence: “The ability, understanding, and knowledge to carry out advocacy \nethically and effectively” (Toporek, Lewis & Crethar, 2009, p. 262) \nAdvocate (the following definition is derived from Kiselica & Robinson, 2001, and was \noriginally utilized to describe solely counselor-advocates): An advocate is an individual who \n“pleads on behalf of a client or some social cause…[taking] action to eliminate or reduce social \nproblems such as poverty, unequal access to opportunity, and various forms of prejudice, which \nadversely affect clients” (Kiselica & Robinson, 2001, p. 387); this definition refers to individuals \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  17 \n \nfrom a variety of backgrounds, and may include community advocates, educators, and helping \nprofessionals. \nGender-expansive: “An adjective used to describe people that identify or express themselves in \nways that broaden the culturally defined behavior or expression associated with one gender” \n(Human Rights Campaign, 2017a). Persons who identify as gender-expansive may or may not \nidentify as transgender. \nGender non-conforming: Individuals whose gender expression and/or identity fails to meet \nsociety’s expectations (Lambda Legal, 2017). Persons who identify as gender-expansive may or \nmay not identify as transgender. \nGender-variant: “The term is deliberately broad, encompassing such specific terms as \ntranssexual, butch and femme, queen, sissy, tomboy, travesty, or hijra” (ALGBTICAL, 2018). \nPersons who identify as gender variant may or may not identify as transgender. \nHelping professional(s): Licensed individuals (at the state and/or national level) who provide \ntherapeutic interventions aimed at alleviating psychological or emotional distress. Within the \ncontext of this study, the label “helping professional” includes Licensed Mental Health \nCounselors, Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors, Licensed Clinical Social Works, \nLicensed Psychologists, and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists. \nTransgender: “Refers to people whose gender identity, one’s inner sense of being male, female, \nor something else, differs from their assigned or presumed sex at birth” (Lambda Legal, 2017). \nPersons who are transgender may identify with the gender binary, and thus may not identify as \ngender-expansive or gender-variant. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  18 \n \nTransgender or gender-expansive children AND Transgender or gender-expansive youth: \nWithin the context of this study, these phrases refer to young people ages 4 to 12 years of age \nwhose gender identity does not align with the gender assigned at birth. \nLimitations of the Study \nThe limitations of this research became apparent during the planning stages, with \nrestrictions relating specifically to scope of applicability of results, and replicability. While the \nuse of qualitative data is essential to developing the study’s conceptualization of advocacy for \nthis population, it also limits the scope of applicability of the results. Limiting this study to only \nnarrative descriptions of individual’s experiences in the United States provides an in-depth \nunderstanding of participant’s process advocating for gender-expansive youth, but fails to \nprovide results that speak to the breadth of experience of advocates and gender-expansive \nchildren at an international level. Readers are encouraged to consider the cases and contextual \nvariables described in this study, and explore the applicability of results as relates to their own \npersonal and professional experience (Shenton, 2004). \nThis study is preceded by a pilot study which utilized interviews with 3 community-based \nadvocates, and this researcher’s auto-ethnographic data to explore how advocates pursue social \nchange for transgender and gender-expansive youth. The pilot study included researcher-as-\nparticipant, and was limited in its scope. Results from the pilot study emphasized the role of \ncollaboration with community-based advocates in parent/caregiver’s ability to reduce \ndiscriminatory practices in their child’s school. Institutionalized oppression that limits \ntransgender and gender-expansive access to resources was identified as one of the most common \nthemes within the interviews and autoethnographic documents utilized as data. A full \nexplanation of the results of the pilot study is well beyond the scope of this text, but can be found \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  19 \n \nin the initial unpublished manuscript (Stark, 2017). The current study utilized more diverse data, \nthus the results had greater breadth, depth, and a wider range of applicability. \nDelimitations of the Study \n The scope of the study is limited to exploring advocacy efforts made in support of \nchildren. Research that supports and empowers transgender and gender-expansive youth is \nessential, as this population faces multiple intersections of oppression due to discriminatory \nbeliefs about the agency and self-knowledge of children, particularly in reference to gender \nidentity (UNICEF, 2014). Interview questions will not elicit information regarding participants \nperspectives concerning adolescent issues. Experiences with adolescents or concerning the \nadolescent age group will be excluded because the issues faced by transgender and gender-\nexpansive individuals in this age bracket have a variety of needs that are distinct from \ntransgender and gender-expansive children. For example, advocates working with transgender \nadolescents who have elected to begin medical transition may be primarily focused on helping \nthe young person to access the necessary services needed for medical gender confirmation. \nIndividuals who work with gender-expansive children may engage in psychoeducation regarding \nmedical transition, but are likely more focused on empowering the child within their \ncommunities and addressing gender-based harassment. \nSummary \n Transgender and gender-expansive youth face a multitude of challenges, from accessing \nresources to coping with gendered-harassment. The adverse experiences of transgender and \ngender-expansive youth may be attributed to the stigma assigned to persons who fail to conform \nto the gender binary. Advocates play an essential role in helping to empower these youth, and \naddress sources of discrimination and oppression at the individual and systems levels. The \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  20 \n \nliterature regarding advocacy efforts is robust, providing practitioners and supportive persons \nwith essential strategies for assisting transgender and gender-expansive youth, yet lacks the rich \ndescriptive detail and contextual information that so strongly influences the advocacy process. \nThe chapter that follows provides a more comprehensive description of sociopolitical events that \ninfluence advocacy efforts, and literature pertinent to the conceptualization of advocacy within \nthe school, community, and family contexts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  21 \n \nChapter 2 \nLiterature Review \n“The personal is political” (Hanisch, 1970) \n”Thus, whether we interact with strangers or intimates, we will find that the finger tips of society \nhave reached bluntly into the contact, even here putting us in our place” (Goffman, 1963, p. 53) \nOverview: The Interplay between Sociopolitical Context & Professional Conceptualization \n As the title of Hanisch’s (1970) famous text on the Women’s Liberation movement \npoints out, “The personal is political.” Hanisch’s statement sheds light on the relationship \nbetween the actions of individuals with status and power, and the personal experience of \ndisenfranchised groups. Hanisch’s words are just as relevant today as they were in 1970, as the \nexperience of today’s transgender and gender-expansive youth is significantly impacted by – and \nat times completely determined by – the city, state, and national political context in which the \nindividual is embedded. Thus “the fingertips of society” (Goffman, 1963, p. 53), consisting of \nindividuals and groups with power and influence, apply stigma as a means of reinforcing the \nimportance of conforming to the social norms of the dominant group. Gender diverse youth who \ndo not align with the male/female gender binary are continually impacted by institutions, groups, \nand individuals with political power. The relationship between sociopolitical events and the \nexperience of transgender and gender-expansive youth, and their advocates and allies, cannot be \noverstated.  \n The following review of the literature begins with a review of the Western \nconceptualization of gender and sex, and the evolution of these constructs over time. Impactful \nsociopolitical events, the experience of these youth in the school and family context, and \nadvocacy strategies employed in these contexts will also be discussed. The aim of this review of \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  22 \n \nthe literature is to describe the most pertinent contextual events that impact the advocacy \nprocess, while also elucidating the myriad of perspectives and practice guidelines provided to \nadvocates supporting transgender and gender-expansive youth. Categories discovered during this \nreview of the literature will act as a conceptual framework for the deductive portion of data \nanalysis.  \nThe Evolution of “Gender” & “Sex” \nSex, and gender are independent complex constructs, with each aspect of the individual’s \nidentity existing along a continuum (The Trevor Project, 2017b). Sex refers to one’s natal sex, or \nbiological sex assigned at birth (American Psychological Association, 2012). Natal sex may \ninclude: Female, referencing a person who presented at birth with female genitalia and/or \nreproductive organs; male, an individual born with male genitalia and/or reproductive organs; or \nintersex, which is categorized as a “health condition [that]…can affect the genitals, the \nchromosomes and/or other body structures” (Lambda Legal, 2008p. 25), causing the individual \nto fit into neither male nor female sex categories. Utterly separate from natal sex, gender \ndescribes how a culture or community defines what “attitudes, feelings, and behaviors” are \nassociated with the male, or female roles in society (American Psychological Association, 2012, \np. 11).  \nThe concept of gender identity stands in stark contrast to natal sex, as gender identity is \nself-defined and may or may not align with society’s prescribed beliefs about gender. Gender \nidentity refers to one’s internal gendered-experience (American Psychological Association, \n2012), existing along a continuum that includes: Male or female-to-male transgender, gender \nfluid, gender queer, bigender (an individual who identifies as both male and female), non-binary \n(an individual who identifies as neither male nor female), or woman or male-to-female \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  23 \n \ntransgender, or other gender identities as defined by the individual. Individuals may or may not \nelect to outwardly present in alignment with their natal sex or gender identity. How an individual \npresents themselves as a gendered being is referred to as gender expression (The Trevor Project, \n2017b).  \nThe Gender Spectrums & the Genderbread Person \nAt this time, the Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Issues \nin Counseling (2009) division of the American Counseling Association (ACA), American \nPsychological Association (2015), and American Academy of Pediatrics (Fernando and Remley, \n2017) conceptualize gender identity and gender expression as existing along a spectrum, with all \ngender identities acknowledged as normative and healthy. Killerman (2015), a self-described \nactivist and social justice advocate used his skills in graphic design to create a comprehensive \nillustration of the numerous spectrums related to gender identity. \nKillerman’s (2015) graphic titled the Genderbread Person illustrates the many spectrums \nof identity associated with one’s gender. Killerman (2015) encourages the use and reproduction \nof this uncopyrighted image, as they (gender neutral singular pronoun intentionally used here) \nhope that their illustration will help educate persons about the importance of deconstructing our \nWesternized understanding of gender. Killerman’s (2015) graphic (see figure 1: The \nGenderbread Person v3) separates the spectrums of gender identity as “woman-ness” and “man-\nness”, gender expression as “feminine” and “masculine”, biological sex as “female-ness” and \n“male-ness”, sexual attraction as “nobody” to “women/females/femininity” and “nobody” to \n“men/males/masculinity”, and romantic attraction as “nobody” to “women/females/femininity” \nand “nobody” to “men/males/masculinity”. The artist states that one of the most recent additions \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  24 \n \nto this third edition of the Genderbread Persons is the separation of romantic and sexual \nattraction as two separate aspects of one’s identity and experience. \nFigure 1 \n The Genderbread Person v.3 (Killerman, 2015) \n \nThe Gender Binary: Traversing Gender Norms \nThe prevailing Western system identifies gender as a dichotomous construct, with only \ntwo acceptable gender presentations: Male or female (Gagne, Tewksbury, & McGaughey, 1997). \nThe origins of this binary system have been traced back to the philosophical understanding of \ngender as paralleling naturally occurring oppositions such as light and dark, activity and \npassivity. The polarity of gender is also attributed to the lack of differentiation between sex, and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  25 \n \ngender identity (Colebrook, 2004). This Western understanding of gender as inextricably \nconnected to and determined by one’s natal sex stigmatizes persons whose gender identity is \nincongruent with their sex assigned at birth.  \nThe culturally defined construct of gender as male or female provide a “line in the sand” \nfor society to define what is normative, and non-normative. When an individual’s gender identity \naligns with their natal sex, the individual is considered cisgender, the socially prescribed norm. \nPersons whose gender identity does not align with their sex assigned at birth are deemed \ntransgender, or gender-expansive (American Psychological Association, 2012). Individuals who \ncross the socially defined boundaries of gender often experience social dislocation from their \ncommunity, the threat of violence, and the “sense of their own unreality, which can lead to \nsuicide or a suicidal life” (Butler, 2004, p. 219).  \nThe non-normative status of persons whose natal sex and gender identity are not \ncongruent, places these individuals at greater risk for adverse experiences. Persons who traverse \nthe gender binary face significantly higher rates of verbal and physical violence within their \nschools (Kosciw et al., 2014), rejection and social exclusion from family members (Sherer, \n2016), and fatal violence motivated by hate of one’s gender identity (Human Rights Campaign, \n2017c). Thus the primary message conveyed by advocacy efforts, that these identities are \nnormative expressions of identity, challenges the greater social paradigm at the root of acts of \noppression, hate and violence – the belief that certain identities devalue the humanity of the \nindividual. \nAdvocacy in Educational Settings \nHumanizing Transgender and Gender-Expansive Youth \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  26 \n \n Persons in an educational setting who are exposed to the personal narrative of a \ntransgender child, and encouraged to empathize and take the perspective of the child and their \nloved ones, exhibit a decrease in transprejudice, and increased desire for social contact with this \npopulation (Tompkins, Shields, Hillman & White, 2015). Tompkins, Shields, Hillman, and \nWhite (2015) administered two separate educational interventions to two separate groups of \nundergraduate students, with each group containing 50 students. One group received a \n“humanizing intervention” (Tompkins et al., 2015, p. 19) consisting of viewing the 20/20 \ndocumentary My Secret Self – A Story of Transgender Children (Dauer, Goldberg, Paul and \nRuff, 2007, p. 6), and a “perspective-taking writing exercise…[where students] were asked to \nimagine they were transgender and to write a letter “coming out” to their parents as transgender” \n(Tompkins et al., 2015, p. 12). The second group received an educational intervention which \nconsisted of a PowerPoint presentation outlining the diagnostic criteria for Gender Identity \nDisorder (GID) as described in DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), and the \nviewing of a video-recorded interview with a mental health professional regarding the \npresentation of children with GID. \n The individuals who were exposed to the humanizing intervention exhibited a significant \ndecrease in prejudice against transgender individuals, and an increase in desire to interact with \nthis population socially. Transprejudice was described as a form of “emotional disgust” towards \ntransgender and gender-variant individuals. Prejudicial beliefs and attitudes motivate \ndiscriminatory behavior, verbal “gender bashing”, and cause the individual to distance \nthemselves socially from persons who are perceived to belong to this population (Tompkins et \nal., 2015, p. 4). Participants in the educational group evinced a significant increase in prejudice \nagainst transgender individuals, and no change in desire to socially interact with this population. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  27 \n \nThe authors conclude that strategies aiming to educate and promote empathy and perspective-\ntaking through exposure to the narratives of transgender individuals, help to decrease stigma and \nprejudicial attitudes and beliefs about transgender persons (Tompkins et al., 2015). Tompkins, \nShields, Hillman and White’s (2015) study is a shining example of how advocacy for \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth can occur in educational settings.  \nThe Role of the School Counselor as Ally and Advocate \n In 2014, Scharron-del Rio, Dragowski, and Phillips published a summary of the previous \n10 years of foundational research regarding the treatment of gender-variant children. The article \nprovided guidance for school psychologists working with this population. The year the article \nwas published, the DSM-IV was the standard reference for conceptualization of symptoms and \ndiagnosis for transgender and gender-expansive youth. In 2014, the only diagnosis available to \ndescribe these children’s experience was Gender Identity Disorder (GID). This diagnosis \npathologized these children’s presentation of gender, and supported corrective treatment \napproaches that aimed to decrease gender non-conforming behavior. The pathologization of \ngender-variance created an atmosphere where two polar perspectives developed within the \nhelping professions— transgender and gender-expansive identities as a normative part of human \ndevelopment, and variations in gender outside of the male/female binary as pathological, to be \ntreated with corrective interventions. \n Scharron-del Rio, Dragowski, and Phillips (2014) described treatment approaches for \ngender-variant youth as either corrective, or supportive/affirming. Corrective treatment \napproaches used behavioral interventions, and collaboration with family members to promote \n“normative gender behaviors” associated with the child’s assigned gender. This may include \nrequiring the child to play with stereotypical toys, and dress in ways that are associated with their \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  28 \n \nnatal sex. Supportive treatment emphasized affirmation of the child’s gender expression, with \ntreatment focusing on environmental stressors that invalidate the child, while promoting parental \nempathy and understanding of the child, and investing in the child’s strengths and sources of \nresilience. Per Scharron-del Rio, Dragowski and Phillips (2014), helping professionals are \nencouraged to remain aware of their own biases about sexual orientation and gender identity, and \nto validate the child’s autonomy and sense of agency in expressing or suppressing their gender \nidentity. The authors also caution against clinicians getting “caught in the middle of an \nideological battle” (p. 51), as parents and adults within school administration may use the school \nenvironment as a battleground for pushing their own ideology (Scharron-del Rio, Dragowski & \nPhillips, 2014). \nAdvocacy Strategies in the School Setting \n The American School Counseling Association (ASCA) (2016) School Counselor and \nTransgender/Gender Non-conforming Youth Position Statement further emphasizes the \nimportance of school counselors’ validation of the self-expressed gender identity of their student \nclients, stating that: \n School counselors recognize that the responsibility for determining a student’s gender \n identity rests with the student rather than outside confirmation from medical practitioners, \n mental health professionals or documentation of legal changes (p. 64). \n In accordance with Title IX and the guidance provided by the Office of Civil Rights \n(OCR) (OCR, 2014), ASCA (2016) advises school counselors to address students by their \nchosen name and accurate pronouns and alter their unofficial educational records to reflect the \nchosen name and accurate pronouns. ASCA (2016) also directs school districts to amend \nsecondary educational records at the request of parents. School counselors are called to affirm \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  29 \n \nand support their students, and are thus expected to reference students by their chosen name and \naccurate pronouns at school and in the classroom, but use the student’s legal name and sex \nassigned at birth when speaking with parents (unless the child or parents have indicated \notherwise). Counselors should support transgender and gender-expansive youth’s right to decide \nif and when to disclose their gender identity to others, and ensure that all students have access to \nthe restrooms or gender-segregated facilities of the gender with which they identify. \nFurthermore, school counselors must ensure that transgender and gender-expansive students are \nprovided the opportunity to engage in interscholastic and physical education activities with the \ngender with which they identify, and express their gender identity in their dress and physical \npresentation without fear of harassment (ASCA, 2016). \n In addition to being charged with validating the self-expressed identity of their child \nclients, school counselors are also called to promote an affirmative environment at the \n“individual, cultural, and systemic levels” (Chen-Hayes, 2001, p. 1). The American School \nCounseling Association (2012) provides school counselors with an action-oriented model that \nenables and supports school counselor’s advocacy efforts for disenfranchised students.  \n The American Counseling Association (ACA) advocacy competencies (Lewis, et al., \n2002) further affirm the need for school counselors and helping professionals to act as “social \nchange agents” (Ratts, DeKruyf & Chen-Hayes, 2007, p. 90), advocating for the removal of \nbarriers to resources at the individual, community, and systems levels. Ratts, DeKruyf and Chen-\nHayes (2007) further elaborate on the ACA advocacy competencies call to action-oriented \napproaches by recommending counselors adopt a social justice approach to their work. The \nauthors translate the advocacy competencies into a series of recommended advocacy strategies, \nto include: Promoting reform of prejudicial school policies, addressing inequalities in access to \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  30 \n \nresources within the school, and seeking change in educational environments that are not \nconducive to learning for LGBTQ students. The social justice approach identifies the system, \nrather than the child or student, as that which needs adjusting (Ratts et al., 2007). \n School counselors who employ a social justice approach can utilize the ACA advocacy \ncompetencies to inform their advocacy efforts in the school system. Ratts, DeKruyf and Chen-\nHayes (2007) provide guidance for the translation of competencies into the practice of advocacy \nin the school environment. The advocacy competencies (authored by Lewis, Arnold, House and \nToporek, 2002) describe 3 levels of advocacy: The client/student, school/community, and public \narena. Within each level, advocates may act with (e.g. empowering the individual, or teaching \nself-advocacy skills) or on behalf (e.g. working with school administration to address \ndiscriminatory school policies) of transgender and gender-expansive students. Table 1 \nsummarizes the primary goals, and interventions recommended by Ratts, DeKruyf and Chen-\nHayes (2007) at each level of advocacy.    \nTable 1 \nRecommended School Counselor Advocacy Interventions (adapted from Ratts, DeKruyf and \nChen-Hayes, 2007) \nLevel of Advocacy Primary Goals Recommended Interventions \nClient/Student Student \nempowerment \nthrough advocacy \nwith, and on \nbehalf of students \nWorking with students: \n- Assisting students individually or in small groups \nwith “self-advocacy tools” (p. 92)in the classroom \nenvironment \n→Self-advocacy may include: Providing students \nwith the language necessary, and/or the opportunity \nto rehearse speaking with their teacher or \nclassmates about their identity or disability, and the \nthings they need to be successful academically; \ndiscussing ways the child can protect themselves \nwhen experiencing bullying, and how to reach out \nto an adult for assistance \n- Parents of students should be informed of their \nright to due process should their child need an \naccommodation \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  31 \n \n- Educational lessons focusing on “communication \nskills or dependable strengths” (p. 92) \n- Engaging groups of students in discussions of peer \nmediation, or bullying \nWorking on behalf of students: \n- Act as an ally and referee to support children in \nsituations where the child must work with peer, \nteacher, or administrator with whom they feel \nunsure or disempowered \n- Address acts of discrimination, or the perpetuation \nof oppression by school administration  \n- Address generational poverty or other systemic \nissues, through the implementation of programs that \nattend to unmet  \nSchool/Community School counselor \nacts as ally, \nworking with \nindividuals and \ncommunity \nmembers to \naffect systemic \nchange \n- Collaborate with organizations to challenge the \nstatus quo, and achieve systemic change \n- Using knowledge of systems, leadership abilities, \nanalysis of data, planning skills, and group \ncollaboration to reduce barriers to resources \n→These skills assist school counselors to identify \ndisparities, and needs of particular groups of \nstudents in the school environment \nPublic Arena School \ncounselors work \nto inform the \npublic of \ninstitutional \nbiases, and unmet \nneeds of students, \nand advocate for \nnecessary \nchanges in public \npolicy to address \nthese issues \n- Use of technology to increase public awareness of \nsources of oppression \n- Understand the inner workings of systems \n- Develop collaborative relationships with persons \nin power \n- May include: \n→Recruiting school board members, or government \nofficials who are willing to advocate for policy \nchange \n→Coordinating trainings and workshops on topics \nwhere teacher competency requires attention \n \nPolicing Gender Norms \nThe School Environment  \nOn a national scale, 64.4% of LGBTQ students report feeling unsafe while at school \nbecause of peers and teachers adverse reactions to their LGBTQ status (Kosciw, Greytak, \nPalmer, & Boesen, 2014). The school environment can be an unsafe and hostile place, with \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  32 \n \napproximately 80% of students reporting experiences of relational aggression (i.e. having lies \ntold about them, or rumors spread), and 22.7% reporting physical assault attributed to their \ngender expression. Teachers and school administration, the first point of contact for students \nexperiencing discrimination, often report feeling underprepared to address incidents of gendered \nharassment and trans-phobia. The culture of the school and “principal’s leadership style, personal \nvalues, professional priorities, and policy implementation” also influence teachers’ ability to \naddress harassment of LGBTQ students (Meyer, 2009, p. 28). Many of the current mechanisms \nwithin schools that are intended to address and reduce instances of bullying fail to address the \nsystemic problem of harassment aimed at policing gender norms (Meyer, 2009). The ultimate \naim of gendered harassment is to communicate condemnation of non-conforming gender \nexpression, and push individuals to conform to “normative” gender practices. \nThe Family Context \nThe policing of gender norms occurs not only in the school environment, but also within \nthe family context. Families may respond to a transgender or gender-expansive child’s “coming \nout”, or openly sharing their gender identity, in a variety of ways. The Family Acceptance \nProject categorizes family’s responses as fitting various levels of acceptance, ambivalence, or \nrejection (Ryan, 2014). There is a significant correlation between family responses to their \nchild’s “coming out” and health outcomes, with children experiencing high levels of family or \ncaregiver rejection being more than 8 times more likely than the general population to attempt \nsuicide, and more than 6 times more likely to experience severe depression (Ryan, 2009). While \nthe role of family rejection has significant negative health implications for LGBTQ youth, family \nacceptance can positively impact the health and wellness of LGBTQ young persons. \nThe Advocacy Efforts of Parents/Caregivers \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  33 \n \nAffirming and Supportive Families \nFamilies who accept their transgender child’s gender identity express their support by \nusing the appropriate gender pronouns and name when referencing their child, and enabling their \nchild to dress, wear their hair, and present themselves how they wish. A transgender child who \nchanges how others reference them, and begins presenting as the gender with which they \nidentify, is said to have “socially transitioned.” A longitudinal study of transgender children \nwhose families supported their social transition, found that these children’s rates of depression, \nanxiety, and adverse mental health symptoms was on par with their cisgender peers (Sherer, \n2016). Children whose families prevented their child from socially transitioning experienced \nsignificantly higher rates of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress (Sherer, 2016). The \nresults of this study indicate the importance of supporting transgender children in presenting as \ntheir authentic selves, as the health consequences of family rejection are dire.  \nThe simple act of family and friends utilizing a young transgender or gender-expansive \nperson’s accurate name and gender pronouns can have a significant impact on their mental \nwellbeing. Russell, Pollitt, Li and Grossman (2018) study of transgender and gender-expansive \nyouths who were referenced using their appropriate name and pronouns at home, school, work, \nand with friends found that these individuals risk of depression and suicidality was dramatically \nlower than peers who were not referenced by their proper name and pronouns. Specifically, \nparticipants whose appropriate names and pronouns were used in all 4 environments (home, \nschool, work, and with friends) exhibited a 65% reduction in suicide attempts, a 34% decrease in \nsuicidal ideation, and 71% fewer symptoms of depression than transgender peers whose name \nand pronouns were not acknowledged (Russell et al., 2018). Family members play a critical role \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  34 \n \nin not only validating their child’s gender identity, but also in advocating for their child in other \nsettings to ensure that their needs are met, and sources of discrimination are reduced. \nThe Advocacy Efforts of Parents and Caregivers \nIn response to changes in political climate and policy, affirming parents and caregivers of \ntransgender children across the country have written letters to the Trump administration. One \nsuch letter, co-signed by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) was signed by more than 1,000 \nparents of transgender children. The letter outlined the fear and worry experienced by families of \ntransgender children in the wake of Trump’s recension of an interpretation of Title IX that \nensured trans-specific protections in schools which received federal funds (Human Rights \nCampaign, 2017b). In the school setting, other advocacy efforts employed by parents and \ncaregivers include: Ensuring that the child is provided equal access to the facilities with which \nthey identify, that the child’s accurate name and gender pronouns are acknowledged by school \npersonnel, and that all instances of gendered-harassment and bullying are addressed by school \nadministration (Brill & Pepper, 2008).  \nThe advocacy efforts of parents and caregivers often arise in response to an unmet need \nof their transgender or gender-expansive child, or experience of discrimination or limited access \nto a resource. Popular media is riddled with examples of occasions where supportive and \naffirming parents/caregivers acted as advocates in response to some outside source of \noppression. One such example of parent-advocacy-out-of-necessity is the story of Joanna Smith \nof Austin, Texas. When the Texas Legislature was considering a bill that would require students \nto use the restrooms and facilities of the sex assigned at birth, or use a designated gender-neutral \nfacility, Joanna elected to speak with the media about how this policy would out her 7 year old \ntransgender son who was “going stealth”, as his transgender identity was unknown to fellow \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  35 \n \nstudents. The act of having her son (Joanna chose to keep his name private) switch from the \nfacilities of the gender with which her identified to the female restroom or gender neutral \nfacilities, would make his transgender identity evident to his peers. Joanna, and several other \nparents of transgender children residing in Texas shared their stories with the Associated Press \n(Hoffman, 2017). Although Joanna chose not to disclose her son’s name, going public about \ntheir experience still presented a risk to her son’s choice to keep his transgender identity private. \nThe act of going public about their child’s story, of vocalizing their concerns about \ndiscriminatory systems-level policies, is often a risky but necessary form of parent advocacy. \nParents/caregivers must weigh the pros and cons of going public about their child’s journey, \nbecause public advocacy may open the child, their siblings, and the family to harassment and \nhate speech from individuals or groups who reject gender diversity (Human Rights Campaign, \n2018c). \nThe advocacy efforts of parents and caregivers of transgender and gender-expansive \nchildren may also take the form of one-on-one interactions with other parents or community-\nmembers regarding their child’s journey (Human Rights Campaign, 2018c). For individuals who \nmay have never personally known a person who is transgender or gender-expansive, exposure to \nthe story of a transgender child may enable these individuals to better understand and empathize \nwith this population (Tompkins, Shields, Hillman & White, 2015). Therefore, the mere act of \nnavigating social spaces and communities as a transgender or gender-expansive youth is in and \nof itself an act of advocacy. Mental health professionals, much like caregivers and parents, are \noften entrusted with responsibility of providing transgender and gender-expansive youth with a \nsafe and supportive space. The following section reviews the role of mental health professionals \nin attending to the needs of this population through competent practice, and advocacy efforts. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  36 \n \nAdvocacy in Mental Health \nThe Advocacy Competency Model & Counseling Competencies for Transgender Clients \n Lewis, Arnold, House and Toporek’s (2003) advocacy competencies introduced a \nconceptual model for organizing counselor’s advocacy efforts and was endorsed by the \nAmerican Counseling Association governing council in 2003. This model provides a means of \nbroadly conceptualizing advocacy efforts and may be applicable to other helping professions. \nLewis, Arnold, House and Toporek’s (2003) advocacy competencies describe advocacy as \noccurring in three domains: With the client/student, school/community, and/or public arena. \nAdvocate’s efforts fall along a spectrum of acting with the client towards empowerment and self-\nadvocacy, or on behalf of the client promoting change within the client’s community, or social or \npolitical context. Advocacy efforts may be further conceptualized as working towards micro or \nmacrolevel change. This model provides enough ambiguity to accurately conceptualize advocacy \nfor a multitude of populations. Where specificity is needed for counselor’s working with a \nspecific population, additional competencies provide specific multiculturally-informed \ninformation to guide counselor decision making. Ratts, Singh, Nassar-McMillan, Bulter & \nMcCullough’s (2016) multicultural and social justice counseling competencies further explain \nthe role of advocacy in cultivating the attitudes and beliefs, knowledge, skills, and action \nnecessary to pursue positive social change for marginalized populations. \n Chen-Hayes (1999) provided guidance regarding one multiculturally-informed approach \nto advocacy for persons whose gender and sexual identities do not meet the heterosexual-\ncisgender norm. Chen-Hayes (1999) stated that prior to engaging in advocacy work, counselors \nmust take inventory of their own privilege. Examples of heterosexual cisgender privilege \ninclude: Not having your gender identity challenged by mental health or medical professionals, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  37 \n \nbeing able to be affectionate with one’s partner in public without fear of harassment or assault, \nno worry of job loss due to gender identity or sexual or affectual orientation, availability of \npositive representations of one’s gender identity and sexual orientation in the media, lack of fear \nof being “outed” around unsafe individuals, and not being expected to educate others about one’s \ngender identity and sexual orientation (Chen-Hayes, 1999).  \n Advocacy strategies employed by counselors should challenge systems that perpetuate \nhomophobic and transphobic beliefs and attitudes, and address transgender and gender-variant \nclients internalized oppression, and sources of external oppression. Internalized oppression \noccurs when members of a non-dominant group begin to believe negative myths and stereotypes \nabout their group and internalize these beliefs. Externalized oppression for LGBTQ persons \nconsists of “what is done, consciously or unconsciously, by members of dominant sexual \norientations and gender identities to keep resources out of the hands of LGBT persons” (Chen-\nHayes, 1999, p. 89). Advocacy strategies employed by counselors that address these sources of \ndiscrimination include: Writing letters to one’s political leaders about discriminatory policies, \nchallenging individuals who verbalize “hateful jokes about LGBT persons” (Chen-Hayes, 1999, \np. 90), using inclusive language such as referring to one’s husband/wife as “partner” or “spouse” \nand not assuming that other’s partners are of a particular gender, promoting education about \nLGBT persons in K-12 school curriculum, supporting media outlets that include positive \ndisplays of LGBT identities, and challenging religious-based belief systems and members of the \ncommunity who pathologize LGBT identities (Chen-Hayes, 1999). \n The 2009 Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues in Counseling \n(ALGBTIC) Competencies for Counseling with Transgender Clients is another example of \nculturally informed competencies aimed at providing unique supports for transgender and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  38 \n \ngender-expansive clients. Clients who traverse the gender binary face significantly higher rates \nof verbal and physical violence within their schools (Kosciw et al., 2014), rejection and social \nexclusion from family members (Sherer, 2016), and fatal violence motivated by hate of one’s \ngender identity (Human Rights Campaign, 2017c). Counselors working with gender-expansive \nindividuals must address the oppression and discrimination experienced by this population. \nThe ALGBTIC competencies (2009) call for counselors working with transgender individuals to: \nB.10. Use empowerment and advocacy interventions when necessary and/or requested (e.g. \nemployment and education discrimination, transgender people of color, housing \ndiscrimination), [and] E.11. Serve as advocates for transgender individuals within \nprofessional counseling organizations, and specifically advocate for anti-discrimination \npolicies concerning transgender individuals \n The ALGBTIC competencies (2009) seem to parallel the levels of advocacy described in \nthe advocacy competencies conceptual model adopted by the American Counseling Association \n(ACA) in 2003. The following section discusses the essential role of community collaboration in \nadvocating for transgender and gender-expansive youth, as outlined in the ACA advocacy \ncompetencies model.  \nAdvocacy through Community Collaboration  \n The ACA advocacy competencies inclusion of advocacy through community \ncollaboration acknowledges the importance of this form of advocacy as a means of addressing \noppression at a systems level (Lewis et al., 2010). This advocacy domain may include assessing \nthe ability of local agencies to competently assist transgender and gender-expansive individuals, \nidentify barriers to the development of resiliency, and collect information for local organizations \nthat provide resources and support for gender-expansive individuals (Singh, 2010). Community-\nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  39 \n \nbased advocates play an essential role in helping professionals ability to collaborate with local \norganizations, as these advocates are often the primary points of contact for trans-affirming \nagencies.  \n The label “community-based” originated in the victim’s advocacy movement, and \noriginally referred to those individuals within the local community who provided assistance to \nvictims of violent crimes or intimate partner violence. These individuals were considered para-\nprofessional helpers, as they often received some training in reflective listening and basic case \nmanagement (Victim Support Services, 2013). This study uses the label “community-based \nadvocates” to reference those individuals within the local community who provide assistance and \nsupport to transgender and gender-expansive young people. Despite their essential role in \nhelping this population to access resources and address oppression, the literature regarding how \nthese advocates pursue social change is lacking. One of the most comprehensive texts on the \nhistorical context of activism for transgender and gender-expansive communities is Stryker’s \n(2017) Transgender History: The Roots of Today’s Revolution. \n One of the dominant themes in Stryker’s (2017) text is the importance of community in \nmaking strides towards equality for transgender and gender-expansive individuals. Stryker notes \nthe achievements of transgender and gender-expansive youth whose visibility and activism are \nincreasing public awareness of the discrimination and inequality experienced by those young \npeople who traverse the gender binary. Forms of community-based advocacy discussed in \nStryker’s (2017) text include: Participation in pride parades and/or demonstrations; advocacy \nefforts facilitated by community resource centers, such as peer groups and educational \nworkshops for community members. Community collaboration may also include advocates \nworking with group homes who serve homeless LGBTQ youth. The author speaks of a shifting \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  40 \n \nparadigm in the United States, a paradigm that views gender identity as an evolving construct \ndefined by each individual. Stryker (2017) attributes this progress in social construction (or \ndeconstruction) of gender to the advocacy efforts of LGBTQ individuals and communities, \ncourageous transgender and gender-expansive youth, and advocates in a variety of settings. \nSummary: Addressing a Niche \n This study is situated within the literature as a unique contribution to understanding \nadvocacy efforts for transgender and gender expansive children. Previous studies have focused \nupon the role of advocacy in the experience of gender variant youth in the school environment, \nand family context. Multiple mental health professions have endorsed conceptual models that \nemphasize the importance of practitioners addressing the systemic sources of oppression that \nimpact transgender and gender-expansive clients experiences. Research considering the \nexperience of advocates for this population has remained focused on historical accounts of the \nsociopolitical context and events that promoted change (Stryker, 2017). Peer-reviewed \npublications are primarily conceptual in nature, focusing on recommendations for advocacy \ninterventions for transgender and gender variant clients. This study explored the advocacy \nprocess and gave voice to the narratives of advocates for transgender and gender-expansive \nyouth, and articulated the contextual elements that impact advocates’ efforts. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  41 \n \nChapter 3 \nMethods \nDesign of the Study \nSingle Holistic Interpretive Case Study \n This study utilized Merriam’s (1988) interpretive case study to guide data collection, \nanalysis, and the write-up of results. Case study design is defined as “an intensive, holistic \ndescription and analysis of a bounded phenomenon” (p. xiv). Case study is further described as a \n“basic design that can accommodate a variety of disciplinary perspectives…and can test or build \ntheory” (Merriam, 1988, p. 2). The purpose of the case study was not to test or develop theory, \nbut to generate categories and themes that help the reader better understand the advocacy process \nfor transgender and gender-expansive youth. This project focused on the study of a single \nholistic case, with the unit of analysis (or focus of the study) being the process of advocacy for \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth. The interpretive nature of the case study means that the \nanalysis of data, and decisions about data collection “rest upon [the researcher’s] intuition” \n(Yazan, 2015, p. 148). In line with the interpretive approach, knowledge (i.e. categories, themes, \nand rich description) is conceptualized as emerging from researcher-participant interactions. This \ndata is then interpreted by the researcher who derives meaning based on their own intuition \n(Yazan, 2015).  \n The study is also considered holistic because it emphasizes the relationship between the \nphenomenon and contextual variables. While the case under study is the advocacy process, data \nwill be organized and reported per individual participant in the form of case “portraits” (Yin, \n2002). Another critical characteristic of this case study design is its bounded nature. Boundaries \nrelating to time and place, activity, and definition and context prevent the research project from \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  42 \n \ncollecting an “explosion of data” due to lack of boundaries, boundaries that ensure that all data \nadequately speaks to the research questions and process under study (Baxter & Jack, 2008). The \nboundaries that “fence in” this case study are further discussed in the delimitations section in \nchapter 1. Other critical characteristics reviewed in this chapter about methods include: The \nrationale for selecting a case study design, explanation of congruence between the process of \nadvocacy and case study as a method of inquiry, sample selection, essential elements for \neffective case study design, and the role of the researcher. \nWhy Case Study? \n There are three primary approaches to case study research, with each approach having \neither positivistic or constructivist leanings (Yazan, 2015). Of the three approaches, Merriam’s \n(1988) case study methodology was selected, as her approach follows a constructivist \nunderstanding of knowledge. Merriam (1988) described research as generating knowledge, rather \nthan discovering it. Merriam’s constructivist approach best fits this study because the process of \nadvocating for transgender and gender-expansive youth is strongly influenced by the context in \nwhich it occurs.  Advocacy is a process, and consists of multiple behaviors influenced by \nattitudes, beliefs, and environmental variables (Hill, Harrawood, Vereen, & Doughty, 2012). The \nprocess of asking questions of participants and recording their verbal disclosures illuminated \nhow each participant constructed reality and understood the process of advocacy. Themes and \ncategories, and rich descriptions of experience that emerged from participant interviews provided \na holistic understanding of the unique reality of each participant, as interpreted by the researcher. \nFollowing analysis of each individual participant’s data, cross case analysis provided insight \nregarding commonalities and distinctions between participants (Merriam, 1988). \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  43 \n \n Merriam’s (1988) approach to case study design is the most fitting method for the \nexploration of the process of advocating for transgender and gender-expansive youth. In her \nfoundational text Case Study in Education (1988) Merriam described case study methodology as \nbest fitting the study of a program, policy, person, group, institution, process, social unit, or \nphenomenon. She stated that as long as the researcher can identify the phenomenon and “fence” \nit in, or delineate boundaries around what they chose to study, then the phenomenon is amenable \nto a case study inquiry/design. Merriam (1998) distinguished case study from casework, case \nmethods, and case history, describing case study as 1) particularistic as it focuses on a specific \nunit of analysis (program, policy, process, etc.), 2) descriptive, providing the reader with a rich \ndescription of the context and experience of the individual/phenomenon, and 3) heuristic, \nproviding the reader with a greater understanding of the phenomenon being studied. Each of the \naforementioned characteristics apply to this research study, as this study attended to the \nadvocacy process as the unit of analysis, provided the reader with a rich description of the \nadvocacy process and the context in which this phenomenon is embedded, and ensured that the \naudience achieved a greater understanding of the topic addressed in the study. \nCase Study and the Advocacy Process: Congruence Between Topic and Method of Inquiry  \n Yazan (2015) described case study design as most appropriate for studies that: 1) Do not \nmanipulate the phenomenon being studied, 2) ask “how” or “why” questions, and 3) the context \nof the phenomenon plays an essential role in the inquiry, as the phenomenon cannot be separated \nfrom its context. The topic studied in this research best fits a case study design as the study’s \nfocus was answering a “how” question, and the phenomenon under examination was not  \nmanipulated. Furthermore, case study research is most appropriate for those studies that \nprioritize the exploration of contextual conditions because of their relevance to phenomenon \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  44 \n \n(Yazan, 2015). The attention given to contextual variables in case study made the design an \nexcellent fit, as one of the study’s primary foci was understanding the contextual variables that \ninfluence the advocacy process. \nLogistics and Planning \n Twelve advocates were recruited for one 1 hour interview each. A minimum number of \n10 participants was sought, as a minimum of 10 participants was necessary to achieve adequate \nbreadth of data and capture the complexity the advocacy process. Per Yin (2011), a more \npositivistic case study theorist, an effective case study design requires anywhere from 25-50 \nunits, with units defined as “data sources”. This study obtained a minimum of 4 sources of data \nper participant, with each participant contributing a demographic questionnaire, 1 interview, 1 or \nmore advocacy documents, and each participant acting as the inspiration for at least 1 \nobservation field note/field journal entry completed by the researcher (see Data Sources section \nfor further information about observation field notes). Thus 10 participants was expected to \nproduce anywhere from 4 to 5 “units” each, with the total number of units for the study falling \nwithin the realm of 30 to 50 units, within the minimum range outlined by Yin (2011). The twelve \nparticipants recruited for the study contributed all necessary data sources, thus the necessary \nnumber of units was exceeded. \n Participants were provided the opportunity to complete a second interview if either of the \nfollowing conditions were met: 1) After the first interview, the participant indicated that they \nwere unable to answer the questions to their satisfaction, and desired the opportunity to complete \na second 1 hour interview to provide further disclosure, and/or 2) after reviewing their interview \ntranscript (during member-checking process), the participant indicated that they did not agree \nwith some aspect of what was said during the interview, and wanted to complete a second 1 hour \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  45 \n \ninterview to clarify certain points. The second interview was to be unstructured, with the \nresearcher inquiring generally about those disclosures from the first interview that the participant \nwished to clarify, or those interview questions from the first interview that the participant wanted  \nto revisit.  \n The first interview followed a semi-structured format, with the researcher asking a series \nof questions outlined in the interview protocol. This interview followed a semi-structured format, \nas participants were asked questions as they fit into the conversation rather than in a mechanized, \nsequential, verbatim way. The wording of questions was altered by the researcher to fit the flow \nof conversation. This format was selected, rather than a highly structured interview protocol, as it \n“allows the researcher to respond to the situation at hand, to the emerging worldview of the \nrespondent, and to new ideas on the topic” (Merriam, 1988, p. 74). Two interview protocols were \nused, with the Interview Protocol for Advocates (see appendix A) utilized with all participants \nwho were not helping professionals, and the Interview Protocol for Helping Professionals (see \nappendix B) utilized with all professionals who described themselves as helping professionals. \nWhile the first interview protocol was developed to elicit general information about advocates \nefforts, the second interview protocol inquired generally about helping professionals’ advocacy \nefforts while also inquiring about more specific aspects of advocacy as described in the \ncounseling and helping literature. \n During the initial interview, participants also completed a brief Demographic Survey (see \nAppendix E), followed by a series of interview questions which elicited information about how \nparticipants pursued social change for transgender and gender-expansive youth. Prior to the first \ninterview, all potential participants were screened to ensure that they had the experience and \nbackground necessary to contribute relevant data. The recruiting materials were potential \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  46 \n \nparticipant’s first introduction to the study, and included a Nomination Recruiting Letter (see \nappendix C) sent to individuals who were nominated by the LGBTQ allies and scholars in my \nprofessional network, and the General Recruiting Letter (see appendix D) which was \ndisseminated widely through LGBTQ organizations and other allies/advocates’ professional and \npersonal networks (see the section “Sample Selection” for further details about the recruiting \nprocess). These recruiting materials indicated that in order to participate in the study, participants \nmust have either identified as an advocate for transgender or gender-expansive children (ages 4-\n12 years) or have acted with or on behalf of a transgender or gender-expansive child to address a \nnegative experience, or unmet need related to their gender identity or expression.  \nSample Selection. The sampling strategy utilized in this study was purposive (Chein, 1981), as \nparticipants were selected based upon their ability to provide data that contributed to the overall \nunderstanding of the process of advocacy.  In line with the purposive sampling strategy, all \npotential participants must have met at least 1 of 2 criterion. Recruiting materials informed each \nparticipant that they must meet have met at least 1 of the 2 following criteria. Once potential \nparticipants responded to recruiting materials, they were asked whether they identify with either \nof the following statements. These statements acted as inclusion criteria, as participants must \nhave answered yes to at least 1 of the statements listed below to have been eligible to participate \nin the study:   \n 1) Do you identify as an advocate for transgender or gender-expansive children (ages 4-\n 12 years)? \n 2) Have you ever acted with or on behalf of a transgender or gender-expansive child to \n address a negative experience, or unmet need related to their gender identity or \n expression?  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  47 \n \n Participants who answered yes to at least 1 of the aforementioned statements were asked \nto review a copy of the informed consent, then indicate whether they would like to proceed with \nparticipation in the study. Participants who meet inclusion criteria and had provided their \ninformed consent after reviewing the informed consent document (appendix F: Informed \nConsent) were scheduled for the 1 hour interview. \n Initial participants consisted of prominent advocates within the community, and \nindividuals that I had become acquainted with through my personal and professional advocacy \nefforts for my gender-expansive daughter. These individuals were informed that, because of their \npublicly known efforts (i.e. one potential participant recently provided one of the local news \nstations with an interview regarding the unmet needs of transgender and gender-expansive youth) \nand experience supporting transgender and gender-expansive youth, they have been identified for \npossible participation in a study exploring how advocates pursue positive social change for \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth (see appendix C for the Nomination Recruiting Letter).  \n The initial participants were recruited from the following organizations and groups. The \nfollowing list also describes the method of contact for individuals within each group: \n• Board members, paid employees, and volunteers at the New Mexico \nTransgender Resource Center: The co-directors of the resource center were  \nprovided with information regarding the study and criteria for participants and \nasked to reach out to individuals he/she/they believed would be eligible to \nparticipate. \n• Helping professionals who are members of the national level or New Mexico \nbranch of the Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and \nQueer Issues in Counseling (ALGBTIC): Helping professionals who attended \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  48 \n \nmy presentation during the July 2017 ALGBTIC state-level conference actively \nparticipated in a discussion of the research design and results from the pilot study. \nThose individuals who participated in the discussion disclosed that they would be \nwilling to participate in future research regarding advocacy for transgender and \ngender-expansive youth. I emailed those presenters to inquire about whether they \nwere interested in participating in the study (see appendix D: General Recruiting \nLetter). \n• Members of the New Mexico Transgender Resource Center Parent Group: \nMany of the parents/caregivers who attend this group engage in advocacy efforts \nfor their child(ren) that attend to multiple levels of need for their child and help to \nimprove the experience of all transgender and gender-expansive youth. I currently \nattend monthly group meetings as a member of this group and made a verbal \nannouncement (following approval from the University of New Mexico \nInstitutional Review Board, and permission from the group facilitator) about the \nstudy, asking that interested group members (who are 18 years or older) please \nmeet with me after the group to discuss possible participation. \n• Members of the National Parents of Transgender Children Facebook Group: \nThis group is a closed Facebook group, meaning that the administrators for this \ngroup screen all group members and monitor all posts. Administrators require that \nall recruiting fliers or letters be sent to group administrators. I sent a copy of the \nGeneral Recruiting Letter (see appendix D) to the group moderators and asked \nthat the letter be shared with group. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  49 \n \n• Educators and advocates from various backgrounds as recommended by initial \nparticipants.  \n Following this first round of recruiting, additional participants were identified using the \nsnowball sampling strategy (Biernacki & Waldorf, 1981), whereby initial participants were \nasked to recommend new participants who met the study criteria. I contacted participants who \nwere recommended by initial participants via email, using the Nomination Recruiting Letter (see \nappendix C).  \nEffective Case Study Design \n An effective case study design typically includes the following components: a) “multiple \nsources of evidence”, b) “a case study database (a formal assembly of evidence distinct from the \nfinal case study report which helps the novice researchers understand how to handle or manage \ndata”, and c) “a chain of evidence (explicit links between the questions asked, the data collected, \nand the conclusions drawn” (Yazan, 2015, p. 142). Each of the aforementioned components will \nbe further explored in the text below. \nA) Sources of Evidence \n Case study design calls for multiple sources of data to ensure that the complexity and \nbreadth of the topic is fully captured. Merriam (1998) stated that effective case study design \nshould include interviews, observations, and the mining of documents, and that these data \nsources should “triangulate” with one another. This study utilized 1 to 2 1-hour interviews with \n12 participants, a demographic questionnaire (completed by each participant), researcher \nobservations recorded in a field journal, and the review of advocacy-related artifacts \nrecommended by study participants. The selection of these sources of data was informed by the \nresults of a pilot study facilitated in spring 2017.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  50 \n \nInterviews & Demographic Questionnaire. Participants completed a minimum of 1, \napproximately 1 hour interview with the primary researcher. Prior to engaging in discussion, \neach participant completed a brief demographic questionnaire to provide contextual information \nabout the participant. Interviews were facilitated in a location that is most convenient to the \nparticipant, and adequately attended to the participant’s need for privacy. Locations that \ninterviews occurred included: Local coffee shops and restaurants, and the participant’s office or \nhome.   \n Participants were provided the option to complete the interview via phone or Zoom \nConference platform. The Zoom Conference platform provided a confidential and secure means \nfor facilitating and recording a video interview, as all video and audio information was encrypted \nand securely transmitted (Zoom Video Communications Inc., 2017). Recorded video interviews \nwere to be stored locally, meaning that all recorded information would be stored solely on the \ninterview facilitator’s computer, and would not be saved to an online database or “cloud” or \nmaintained by Zoom. In order to use the Zoom platform, participants would have been required \nto download the Zoom Video Conferencing application to their computer, phone, or smart \ndevice. The download and use of Zoom for study participants is completely free.  \n Zoom recorded interviews were to be transcribed and analyzed using the same strategies \nfor the processing of audio-recorded interviews, as outlined in the Data Analysis Procedures \nportion of this manuscript. Regarding the privacy needs of participants during the interview \nprocess, I anticipated facilitating all Zoom interviews from a quiet private location, where others \nwere unable to hear or view any portion of the interview. Interviews were to be facilitated when \nmy personal laptop was connected to my secure, personal hotspot for internet service. At the \nbeginning of each Zoom facilitated video interview, participants were to be informed of the \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  51 \n \naforementioned measures used to attend to participant privacy. Participants were to be asked \nwhether the set-up of the interview met their privacy needs, or if they wanted to change some \naspect of the set-up prior to beginning the interview. No participants elected to utilize this option, \nand instead completed their interviews in person, with one participant asking to complete the \ninterview over the phone. \nThe Field Journal. During the pilot study, community-based advocates engaged in hour long \nsemi-structured interviews. After each interview, I sat down with my field journal and recorded \nthe details of my experience during the interview. Over the course of the pilot study, my post-\ninterview reflections became indispensable sources of data, as they provided insight regarding \nimportant contextual variables that were not distinguishable in the interview recording (e.g. \nparticipant non-verbal behaviors, expressions of emotion, the influence of interview setting). I \nfollowed a similar process in the current case study, recording my observations about the \nparticipant and the interview process immediately after each interview. The field journal also \nincluded reflexive statements regarding my experience during the research process. Each entry in \nthe field journal included the following components: Nature of relationship with researcher, \nexperience during interview, and a reflexive statement. The purpose of these field notes was to \nrecord relevant contextual information. These notes were coded and referenced in the individual \nparticipant case portraits. \nAdvocacy-Related Documents and Artifacts. The pilot study shed light on the importance of \nadvocacy-related documents and artifacts, as all three participants in the pilot study \nrecommended—without prompting—specific books, articles, websites, or films that they felt \nrelated to some aspect of their own advocacy process. During the current case study, participants \nwere asked during the interview if they would recommend any specific advocacy related \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  52 \n \ndocuments (e.g. a state-level policy regarding gendered harassment in schools, or a book about \nthe LGBTQ rights movement in the United States), what their rationale was for recommending \nthe document, and what they wanted me to notice or review in the document.  \n Thus to attend to the essential elements outlined in Merriam’s (1988) text, and to \nincorporate the suggestions of participants from the pilot study, interviews, demographic \nsurveys, observations (in the form of field journal entries), and advocacy-related artifacts were \nutilized as data sources. Advocacy-related artifacts were analyzed by a brief review of the \nartifact by the researcher (i.e. through the reading of documents, and viewing/listening to videos \nor audio recordings), and coding of the information provided by the participant. A summary of \neach participant’s recommended artifacts was included in their case portrait. \nAnalytic Memos. Whenever a change was made to the research design or an evolving question  \nidentified, an analytic memo was produced detailing the change or development and the rationale \nbehind the change. Analytic memos also attended to how codes or themes were identified and the \nevolution of the relationships between concepts. The purpose of these memos was to provide a \nrecord of the evolution of and contextual variables related to the data collection and analysis \nprocess. \nB) The Case Study Database \n The case study database was stored in the Atlas.ti computer program, saved to my \npersonal password protected laptop computer. Each interview transcript, demographic survey, \nfield journal entry, information regarding recommended advocacy-related artifacts, and analytic \nmemos were uploaded to Atlas.ti. Atlas.ti allows for the creation of separate saved projects, with \neach project containing only those data files that I upload to the specific project. By creating a \nseparate saved project in Atlas.ti for each participant, I was able to keep the data sources for each \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  53 \n \nparticipant completely separate. Each participant’s project was named using the pseudonym \nassigned to the participant. Separating the data by participant helped me to review data per \nparticipant, with each project containing the individual participant’s interview, demographic \nquestionnaire, advocacy-related artifact information, field journal entry, and analytic memo. \nOnce each participant’s data were evaluated, copies of the coded data files (e.g. coded \ntranscripts, field journal notes, advocacy document information) were uploaded into another \nproject in Atlas.ti. This new project (to be titled “Cross Case Analysis”) was dedicated to the \nanalysis of data sources across cases, reviewing which codes and themes were similar or distinct.  \nC) The Chain of Evidence \n The chain of evidence described by Yazan (2015) links the research questions with data \nsources. Table 2 provides an outline of the chain of evidence.  \nTable 2  \nChain of Evidence \nResearch Questions Data Collected \n1) How do advocates pursue positive change at \nthe individual and systems levels for transgender \nand gender-expansive children (ages 4 to 12)? \nInterviews  \nField Journal Entries \n2) What contextual variables have influenced \nadvocate’s ability to advocate for transgender and \ngender-expansive youth? \nInterviews  \nDemographic Survey \nInformation regarding recommended \nAdvocacy-related Documents  \nAnalytic Memos \n  \n Yin (2002) recommends a similar method for illustrating the different components of the \nresearch study, and evolution of the research design. Yin (2002) titles this the “Road Map” of \ncase study design, and describes the diagram as providing the researcher with a clear protocol for \nthe investigation. Figure 2 provides a roadmap of the research protocol for this case study. \nFigure 2 – Case Study Road Map \n \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  54 \n \n \n \n \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  55 \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRole of the Researcher \n My role in this study was that of student investigator, meaning that I was the primary \nauthor, and facilitated all aspects of the project from data collection to analysis. In relation to the \nparticipants involved in the study, I was both an insider and outsider (Lapan, Quartaroli & \nRiemer, 2012) and participant-observer (Bernard, Wutich & Ryan, 2017). Although I am the \nparent of a gender-expansive child, and a community-based advocate for gender-expansive \nyouth, I myself am a cisgender heterosexual white female. Although the melding of my identities \nprovided me access to many of the participants who were recruited for the study, my identities \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  56 \n \nalso placed me in the role of “ally” and outsider, as I was not and am not a member the LGBTQ \ncommunity. While I knew the majority of the participants included in the first round of data \ncollection, the second round of participants consisted of individuals with whom I was not well \nacquainted. \n My experiences addressing discriminatory practices in my 8-year-old daughter Zelda’s \nschool inspired the pilot study that preceded this project. Agency-based advocates and other \nparents/caregivers provided myself and my partner with indispensable support and advice as we \nobtained legal representation and negotiated change within our school district. Our family joined \na transgender-youth play group where Zelda gained a sense of empowerment through her \nsupportive interactions with advocates, other parents, and fellow gender-expansive youth. \n These experiences shaped my identity as an advocate, a licensed helping professional, \nand an academic. Advocating for Zelda as a parent and counselor-advocate introduced me to a \nmultitude of community-based advocates and provided a platform upon which to build rapport \nwith these individuals and related organizations. The participants interviewed for this pilot study \nwere known to this researcher as acquaintances, colleagues, and friends before the initiation of \nthe research. \n The nature of this researcher’s relationship to the topic and participants involved some \nethical implications, as this researcher’s insider status with initial participants required extra \nprecautions to ensure privacy of participants, and confidentiality of information disclosed during \ninterviews. As my family and I will continue to attend support group meetings and other events \nwhere individuals who may participate in the study may be present, it is essential that I do not \ndiscuss any of the details disclosed during the interviews even when the identity of the \nparticipant is not revealed. The intimate nature of relationships among study participants and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  57 \n \nwith this researcher, and the size of the community challenge the maintenance of confidentiality \nregarding who has participated in the study.  \nData Analysis Procedures \n Data was analyzed using Merriam’s (1988) approach to case study. Immediately after \neach interview is complete, the following occurred: 1) a pseudonym was assigned to the \nparticipant, and this identifier was recorded at the top of the demographic questionnaire (no \nidentifying information was recorded on the questionnaire), 2) the audio recording for the \ninterview was transcribed, 3) a list of the participant’s recommended advocacy artifacts was \nrecorded, and 4) a field journal entry was completed describing the nature of relationship \nbetween researcher and participant, researcher’s experience during interview, and a reflexive \nstatement. Hard copies of all data sources were printed for initial review. All data sources were \nalso uploaded into Atlas.ti. Each data source was reviewed 3 to 5 times from beginning to end. \nThe initial two readings and open coding of the transcripts and other data sources occured using \nprinted copies, with “notes, comments, observations, [and] queries” (Merriam, 1988, p. 131) \nrecorded in the margins of the document. According to Merriam (1988) this initial reading of the \ndata is akin to “holding a conversation with the data” (Merriam, 1988, p. 131). The notes and \ncodes recorded in the margins were then entered into Atlas.ti. All additional reviews of these \ndocuments occurred in the Atlas.ti program.  \n Those themes and concepts that seemed to stand out, and that appeared to “cut across the \ndata” (Merriam, 1988, p. 131) were recorded in analytic memos. The notes recorded in the \nmargins of the data files were then developed into a primitive list of categories. This initial list or \noutline provided the beginnings of a classification system that enabled me to identify patterns in \nthe data. The categories outlined in this classification system consisted of words or phrases. The \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  58 \n \nconcepts and themes related to each category, also known as “factors”, included phrases or full \nparagraphs derived directly from the data (e.g. interview transcripts, field notes for advocacy \nartifacts or regarding researcher reflexivity, researcher memos). Lincoln and Guba (1985) \ndescribe this intensive analysis of the data as “unitizing” the data, as the information is broken up \ninto small pieces that can then be categorized.  \n Once data was adequately “unitized”, I began reviewing categories and related factors \nlooking for relationships between categories, and the presence of overarching relationships \nbetween categories that cut across multiple participant’s data. In line with Merriam’s (1988) case \nstudy design, the construction of categories emerged from both the content analysis and \nborrowed from previous literature. According to this approach, inductive and deductive \ncomparative strategies are employed to identify categories that are: Relevant to the purpose of \nthe research, and independent of one another so that no one variable fits in more than one \ncategory. Per Merriam (1988) and Glaser and Strauss (1987) an inductive approach to \ncategorization is most desirable in qualitative research, as it ensures that categories are congruent \nwith the data, and relevant to the purpose of the research. Although categories may be borrowed \nfrom other research, these deductively derived categories may be less evident in the data and fail \nto adequately capture the richness of data (Merriam, 1988). \n During the planning stage of the research process, the concepts previously discussed in \nchapters 1 and 2 of this manuscript came together to inform the analysis of data. During the \ncategorization process, concepts from previous literature and the pilot study were used as a lens \nthrough which to view the data. If any of the concepts from previous literature or the pilot study \nappeared evident in the data, then that data was categorized according to those borrowed \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  59 \n \ncategories. Table 3 provides a summary of these deductive categories, related factors, and their \nsource.  \nTable 3 \nData Analysis - Aspects of the Advocacy Process: Deductively Derived Categories, Factors, \nand their Sources \nDeductive \nCategory \nRelated Factors Source(s) \nMicro/Individual \nLevel and \nCommunity Level \nSources of \nAffirmation and \nSupport for \nTransgender and \nGender-Expansive \nYouth (i.e. \nindividuals or \ngroups that \nprovide direct \nservices to this \npopulation) \nFamily & Caregivers \n• Affirm, accept and support gender identity;

Following Merriam’s (1988) approach to the \nanalysis of content of case study data, the following inductive comparative strategies were \nutilized (Merriam, 1988, p. 136): \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  63 \n \n1) “Categories will reflect the purpose of the research”, \n2) “Categories should be exhaustive”: All identified themes and concepts should be \namenable to being categorized, \n3) “The categories should be mutually exclusive—no single unit of material should be \nplaced in more than one category”, unless units/themes have distictive features that \nenable them to apply to more than one category, \n4) “Categories should be independent”, \n5) “All categories should derive from a single classification principle”. \n Data analysis first occurred individually for each participant, with the data sources for \neach participant analyzed and compared to only data sources for that participant. Results were \nreported individually for each participant, in the form of participant “portraits”. Portraits contain: \nA summary of demographic information; how the participant was recruited, logistical \ninformation regarding the interview, and the participant recommended advocacy artifacts and \ntheir information (derived from the analytic memo and interview transcript); rich description of \nthose contextual variables that impacted the participant’s advocacy process; and the themes and \nconcepts identified in the participant’s data (to include: Phrases, words, and text descriptions in \nthe form of short paragraphs derived directly from the participant’s data). The individual \nportraits were followed by a section dedicated to the analysis of themes and concepts across \ncases. \nMethods for Verification \n Multiple verification strategies were used throughout data collection and analysis to \nensure that the study was adequately rigorous. This study maintained trustworthiness by \nattending to Lincoln and Guba’s (1985) four concepts: Credibility, transferability, dependability, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  64 \n \nand confirmability. Triangulation of investigators was utilized to test the accuracy of findings, \nand attend to alternate perspectives (Carter et al., 2014). In order to achieve this form of \ntriangulation, my colleague Katie Brammer, a fellow PhD student in counselor education, \nreviewed and coded all data independently. Katie was selected to review the data because of her \nexperience advocating for LGBTQ youth as a counseling professional and as a community \nmember. Katie volunteers in the non-profit industry, and previously ran a private practice \nspecializing in the treatment of LGBTQ children, adolescents, and their families. She and I met \nregularly during the data collection and analysis phase to discuss emerging themes.  \nCredibility. Lincoln and Guba’s (1985) concept of credibility refers to the degree of congruency \nbetween reality and the construct being studied. This study accurately explored advocates’ \nexperiences with advocacy by utilizing the literature, and research in counseling to sensitize the \ndevelopment of interview questions. The application of a case study design to the exploration of \nthis phenomenon was the first of its kind, thus no comparable studies were available for \ncomparison of methods of data collection and analysis. Credibility was attended to through the \nuse of triangulation of informants/participants, as the perspectives of multiple sources—\neducators, helping professionals, and community advocates for gender-expansive and \ntransgender children—were explored during the interview process (Shenton, 2004). \n The initial pilot study provided this researcher with engagement with artifacts related to \ncommunity-based and parent facilitated advocacy efforts. A detailed review of cultural events as \npart of the literature review helped set the stage for understanding the sociopolitical context of \nthe construct being studied. This prolonged exposure to the construct and culture of the \ncommunity prior to data collection ensures an informed approach that is more likely to \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  65 \n \neffectively capture data that accurately reflects the experience of advocates for transgender and \ngender-expansive youth (Shenton, 2004).  \nTransferability. The unique context of the advocates interviewed in this study strongly \ninfluenced the transferability of data-derived themes. While it is unlikely that the results from \nthis study are generalizable, readers may determine that the experiences of advocacy described \nrelate to personally or professionally witnessed examples of advocacy for gender-expansive \nyouth. This study provided rich descriptions of the phenomenon to enable readers to make their \nown case for transferability of results (Shenton, 2004). \nDependability. Dependability references the ability of researchers to replicate the study and \nachieve equivalent results (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). The constant evolution of the movement for \nequality for transgender and gender-expansive individuals means that this study captured aspects \nof advocacy as a phenomenon that are context dependent. What was described, recorded, and \nemerged from the data reflects a specific time in history within a rather conservative \nsociopolitical context, and at a unique space in each participants’ journey and development. Any \nand all changes to research design or developments during the data collection process were \ndescribed in-depth in analytic memos authored by the primary investigator. These memos were \ndistinct from the field journal entries as the memos discuss only research design, where the field \njournal explored experience during interviews and contextual variables related to each individual \ninterview. Memos about the research process ensured that the description of research design in \nthe final write-up of this dissertation provided the reader with an adequate understanding of each \nstep in the research process. \nConfirmability. Confirmability references the degree of objectivity of the researcher, to ensure \nresults that are accurately reflective of the phenomenon under study (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  66 \n \nAlthough investigator bias inevitably influenced aspects of data collection and interpretation of \nresults, multiple strategies were employed to reduce bias.  This researcher attended to \ninvestigator bias by consistently journaling throughout the process, addressing this researcher’s \nreflexive process, and any perceived countertransference (countertransference is counseling-\nrelated term that references the counselor’s experience when some aspect of the client, or in this \ncase participant, triggers an unanticipated response in the counselor).  \n Transparency of researcher decision making was achieved through the provision of a \ndetailed diagram outlining the methodological process (see Figure 2). This diagram provided an \n“audit trail” illustrating step-by-step the decisions made and procedures utilized. The “audit trail” \nensured that readers are aware of each step, and the variables that influenced researcher decision-\nmaking. The ultimate goal of such transparency is to allow the reader the ability to decide the \nconfirmability of results (Shenton, 2004).  \nSummary \n This research study utilized Merriam’s (1988) approach to case study design to inform \nthe development of a single holistic interpretive case study of the advocacy process for \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth. The advocacy process cannot be divorced from the \nsociopolitical context in which it occurs. This form of case study design pays homage to the \ncritical role of contextual variables in the phenomenon under study. Case study was also used for \nthe write up of results, with a section dedicated to each participant’s “portrait”. An additional \nsection was devoted to analysis across cases. The case study format ensured that the study \nadequately attended to the voices of each participant, while also providing an organized \nconceptualization of results that allowed readers to develop an improved understanding of the \ntopic. While the previous 3 chapters provide the foundation and background information \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  67 \n \nnecessary for understanding the basis of this study, the following chapters outline the results or \ndata analysis. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  68 \n \nChapter 4  \nFindings \nResearch Design: Evolution During Data Collection \nCase Study Data: Adequacy of Number of “Units” or Data Sources \n According to Yin (2011), case study research design requires 25-50 “units” in order to \nensure that the data adequately illustrates the phenomenon under study. Yin (2011) loosely \ndefines these units as “the number of interviewees, practices, policies, or actions included in a \nstudy” (p. 91). This study conceptualizes these units as sources of data, to include: A \ndemographic questionnaire, one 1-2 hour interview (no participants elected to participate in a \nsecond interview, but several participants elected to extend their initial interview to 1.25-2 \nhours), 1 field journal entry, and 1 or more advocacy artifacts or documents. Each participant had \n1 of each of the aforementioned data sources, thus contributing 4 “units” each to the total number \nused in this case study design. A total of 12 individuals participated in the study, thus the \nanalysis ultimately utilized a total of 48 data units, falling on the upper end of the 25-50 unit \nrange provided by Yin (2011). \n The initial case study design listed each individual advocacy artifact recommended by a \nparticipant as an individual “unit” or data source. The original design called for a full review of \neach advocacy artifact by the researcher, to include the coding of each item. Participants were \nexpected to recommend 1-3 advocacy artifacts. During the data collection process, all \nparticipants referenced more than three artifacts, with some participants recommending as many \nas 12 artifacts. Rather than consider each advocacy artifact referenced as a “unit” and engage in \nin-depth analysis of each recommended item, the participant’s provision of artifact information \nwas considered 1 unit. In the interest of time and available resources, I chose to limit the analysis \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  69 \n \nof these artifacts to the information provided by the participant, and my brief review of the \nliterature and popular media sources regarding the advocacy artifact. Each case portrait \nconcludes with a table containing the advocacy artifacts recommended by the participant. When \nmultiple participants recommend the same advocacy artifact, the artifact is described in detail in \nthe first participant’s case portrait then briefly mentioned in the case portraits of subsequent \nparticipants who recommended the item. \nMember-Checking of Transcripts \n The initial research design indicated that participants would be provided the opportunity \nto review their interview transcripts. Due to concerns about maintaining complete confidentiality \nof participants, member checking of transcripts was not completed. The concerns related to \nconfidentiality were two fold: Once interviews were transcribed, assigned pseudonyms, and the \nrecordings erased, there was no definitive way to ensure that the transcript belonged to a specific \nparticipant. Also, providing the participant with a copy of the transcript via email would risk \nidentifying the participant with their transcript and the information contained therein. For these \nreasons, member-checking was not completed with the interview transcripts. \nChanges to Interview Protocol \nDuration and Frequency of Interviews. The initial case study design provided participants the \nopportunity to engage in a second interview should the participant feel that 1) at the end of the \nfirst interview they still had more information to share and wished to complete a second \ninterview to provide further information, and/or 2) the participant reviewed their transcript \nduring the member checking process and felt that the information contained in the transcript did \nnot adequately reflect their experience, and they would like to meet for a second interview to \nclarify certain points. Participants were not provided the opportunity to review their transcripts \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  70 \n \ndue to confidentiality concerns (see previous section for further details), but 4 of the 12 \nparticipants elected to increase the time spent from the initial interview from 50-60 minutes to \n83-102 minutes in order to provide more detailed response to the interview questions. None of \nthe participants elected to complete a second interview. \nInterview Setting: In-Person, Zoom, and Phone. The original research design stated that \nparticipants would be provided the option of completing the interview in person, or via Zoom, a \nconfidential HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant online \nconference platform. Of the 12 participants, 11 lived locally (in the state of New Mexico) and \nelected to complete the interview in-person. Only 1 participant lived outside of the state of New \nMexico, and she asked to complete the interview via phone. This participant stated that she was \nunfamiliar with the Zoom conference platform, and that she felt that completing the interview via \nphone would adequately meet her need for privacy. This participant did not state her full name \nduring the phone interview and reported completing the interview in her private home office. I \ncompleted this interview in a private office at the Women’s Resource Center at the University of \nNew Mexico and ensured that none of the participants disclosures could be heard by others. \nCase Portraiture \n The proceeding case portraits provide the reader with an in-depth description of each \nparticipant’s experience advocating for transgender and gender-expansive children. Each \nparticipant was selected for their experience with the phenomenon of advocacy for transgender \nand gender-expansive children and served as an independent case. Interpretive case study, the \nprimary approach utilized in this study, calls for the independent analysis of each case followed \nby a cross case analysis. The analysis of independent cases enables the researcher to attend to \n“the contextual variables…that might have bearing on the case” (Merriam, 1988, p. 154) and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  71 \n \nfacilitates the creation of case “portraits” (Lightfoot, 1983). Each case portrait attended to five \nessential features: 1) Context, 2) voice, 3) relationship, 4) emergent themes, and 5) the aesthetic \nwhole (Given, 2008). \nContext \n The primary source of data for each participant was one, 1 to 2 hour interview. Prior to \ndelving into the categories and themes that emerged from the data, the setting in which each \ninterview occurred was described. The historical, temporal, and cultural context of the individual \nparticipant was also articulated through reference to their demographic information, and \ndisclosure of the personal experiences that lead them to advocacy work. Reference to \nparticipant’s individual historical context “considered the origins and evolutions of each \nparticipant” (Given, 2008, p. 645). \nVoice \n My voice as researcher, and one who has ongoing interactions with several of the \nparticipants, is present within each case portrait. This voice is evident in the summarization and \ninterpretation of data as I act as a witness, giving voice to each participant’s lived experience. \nThe descriptions provided are rich with contextual information, and the participant’s own words, \nenabling the reader to decipher how generalizable the results are to his/her/their own experience. \nRelationship \n Although only one interview was conducted to collect data, the relationship between \nparticipant and researcher was essential to the collection of data. Relationship in case portraiture \nrefers not only to the rapport between researcher and participant, but also to the researcher’s \nrecognition of the value of the participant’s time, disclosure, and space. Each case portrait \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  72 \n \nincludes a description of the researcher’s relationship with the participant and attends to any \nreferences made during the interview regarding this relationship. \nEmergent Themes \n While filtering through the data, certain themes were “consistently born from the data” \n(Given, 2008, p. 674). These themes informed the interpretation of data, and subsequent \nstructuring of categories. Themes included metaphors, specific acts, and experiences that gave \nvoice to the participant’s reality. \nThe Aesthetic Whole \n Viewing the entirety of the individual case portrait, the structure of the inquiry and \nparticipant’s overarching narrative are evident. Categories and emergent themes are sequential \nand build upon one another. The whole of the participant’s portrait links back to the questions \nthat informed the research design. \nParticipant Case Portraits \nValerie \nValerie’s Background Information \n Valerie describes herself as a white heterosexual cisgender female, and states that her \npronouns are she and her. Valerie was born in the 1960s, and describes her upbringing as \nteaching her only “negative” things about the LGBTQ community. A few years ago Valerie \nearned her masters degree in the human services field, and began working in a shelter for persons \nexperiencing homelessness. She says that her personal experience with discrimination coupled \nwith witnessing the stigma her brother experienced while experiencing homelessness strongly \nmotivated her to work with disenfranchised populations. About 2 years ago Valerie began \nworking in the non-profit industry; she describes her annual income as between $35,000 and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  73 \n \n$49,999. She describes her current position as including advocacy for the transgender and \ngender-expansive community through outreach and education, and advocating for change at the \ncommunity, city, and state levels. \n Valerie currently resides in New Mexico and lives with her partner in a rural community \njust outside of a major metropolitan area. She was nominated for participation in this study by \nanother study participant, who also works in the non-profit industry. Valerie and I attend the \nsame support, myself as an attendee and parent of a transgender child, and Valerie as a human \nservices professional. I informed Valerie in-person during one of the support groups that she was \nnominated to participate in the study. I asked if Valerie were interested in participating in a 1 \nhour interview about her experience as an advocate, and she readily agreed.  \nInterview Context \n Valerie and I arranged to meet at a Starbucks near Valerie’s home, immediately before \nlunch time. Although Valerie stated that she felt that completing the interview at Starbucks \nwould provide adequate privacy, I showed up to the location 30 minutes prior to the interview to \nidentify the most private seating area. I changed tables multiple times until I was able to obtain \nseating in a back corner of the coffee shop, away from the other seating areas, where the \nbackground music and noise seemed hushed.  \n Despite our location in the shop, customers consistently walked by our table who could \npotentially hear some bits and pieces of our conversation. Valerie appeared aware of this and \nseemed to speak in hushed tones whenever she said the words “transgender”, “Trump”, or \n“conservative”. She also appeared to look around whenever she made statements about the \nconservative media, and the Trump presidency. Valerie completed the demographic survey, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  74 \n \nverbally provided a list of advocacy artifacts, and the completed the interview in a total of 53 \nminutes. \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n The following themes were inductively derived during the coding of Valerie’s interview \ntranscript. During the initial 3 readings of the transcript, portions of Valerie’s narrative were \nassigned themes based upon the meaning Valerie's words seemed to convey. These themes were \nthen grouped into categories (also known as code groups) based upon their relatedness to one \nanother. For example, Valerie referenced her personal and professional development as an \nadvocate throughout the interview. This category included a variety of themes, or inter-related \naspects that cumulatively described Valerie’s journey as an advocate. Themes within the \ncategory of personal and professional development as an advocate included: Valerie’s experience \nas a helping professional, her personal motivation and inspiration to advocate and help others, \nand her sense of privilege due to perceived identity. These inductively derived categories and \nthemes may be present in other participant’s data, but will be unique to their lived experience \nand perspective. Shared themes and categories will be further discussed in the cross case analysis \nportion of this manuscript. \nPersonal and Professional Development as an Advocate \nInspiration and Motivation for Advocacy Work  \n Valerie describes herself as a lifelong advocate, working to elevate the voices of persons \nwho have experienced discrimination and stigma. She reports advocacy being a big part of both \nher personal and professional interactions with others, from her family to community members. \nA helping professional, Valerie describes herself as having “that kind of drive in me to advocate \nfor people who don’t have their voices heard”. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  75 \n \n Valerie’s journey to becoming the advocate she is today is interwoven with a variety of \nexperiences that inspired her to seek work with disenfranchised populations. Valerie describes \nhaving experienced discrimination and oppression in her personal life, as well as witnessing the \noppression her brother faced while he was experiencing homelessness. She states that these \nexperiences have helped her to empathize with transgender and gender-expansive individuals \nwho are often faced with discrimination and family rejection for “just being you”. Valerie \nreferences her age as helpful when it comes to understanding the oppression experienced by \npersons with diverse gender identities, saying that she has “seen a lot”. Per Valerie: \nI've had my own things happen in my life. I think that helped me to understand what it \nmeans to be discriminated against when you're just being you. I know what it feels like \nwhen your family is not very supportive. I've seen a lot. My age helps me sometimes. \n Since beginning her work as an advocate, first with a shelter that serves persons \nexperiencing homelessness, then later as an advocate within the non-profit industry, Valerie says \nthat her advocacy work has transformed her personal life and relationships. She describes \ndiscussing her work with her family members, including those who reject transgender and \ngender-expansive identities as invalid or seem ambivalent and unsupportive of this population. \nValerie says that her work has enabled her to educate her family and help them become more \naccepting of the transgender and gender-expansive community: \nMy whole family is really interested in my work now. I think it's kind of cool because \nI've educated them and they are wanting to know more. It's cool to hear that my brother \nchanged the way he talks, and he's really open minded to [other gender identities]. I never \nthought I'd get there with him. \nPrivilege Due to Perceived Identity \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  76 \n \n Working as an advocate within the non-profit industry, Valerie states that her age not \nonly helps her to empathize with clients, but also seems to influence other’s assumptions about \nher perspective on gender identity. Valerie describes herself as a white, heterosexual, cisgender \nfemale, with her physical presentation aligning with these identities. She says that her physical \npresentation, coupled with her being raised in a conservative environment, “really shocks people \nwhen they hear my opinion because I didn't know anything about [the LGBTQ] community \nexcept for what I was told when I was raised, which was negative”. Valerie states that the \nidentities associated with her physical presentation are associated with the hetero-cisgender \n“norm” and thus afford her the opportunity to engage in discussions and have her voice heard in \nspaces where persons of oppressed identities might not be heard. \n Other’s perception of Valerie as a cisgender heterosexual white woman in her 50s \ninfluences the way that others interact with her, particularly when discussing the topic of gender \nidentity. Valerie describes interacting with individuals who are non-affirming or rejecting of \ngender identities outside of the male-female binary who seem to assume that she is “on that side” \nbecause of her age, or their belief that she may be identify with a LGBTQ rejecting religious \norganization. According to Valerie: \nI always wonder if it's because I am a cis woman and they think I'm on that side because \nof my age. I'm like, “excuse me, how dare you!”. But it gives me that opportunity to use \nmy opinion too. It's like, if you want to give me yours then I'm going to give mine. Jesus \nhas nothing to do with it.  \n Valerie says that she has utilized those experiences where individuals identify her as non-\naffirming or rejecting as opportunities for advocacy through discussion. She describes using \nthese instances – where others initiate conversation based on their perception of her identity – as \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  77 \n \nthe foundation for advocacy on a micro-level. In Valerie’s case portrait, micro-level advocacy \nserves as a category or umbrella concept, with multiple themes residing beneath this umbrella. \nMicro-level Advocacy \nAdvocacy through Verbal Interactions and Discussion \n In situations where individuals assume that Valerie is a cisgender heterosexual Christian \nwhite woman with beliefs that align with these dominant groups, Valerie describes allowing \nthese individuals to share their opinion with her, then shares her own perspective coupled with \neducation about gender-identity. Although Valerie describes feeling appalled that persons make \nassumptions about her beliefs based on her appearance, she also views these instances as \nopportunities to engage in discussion. Lewis, Ratts, Paladino and Toporek (2011) define micro-\nlevel advocacy in counseling as those actions taken by helping professionals at an individual \nlevel on behalf of the client. This level of advocacy is described as typically occurring between \nthe counselor and an organization or individual, to address discriminatory action or barrier to \nresources. Valerie describes micro-level advocacy in the form of verbal interactions/discussion \nas one of her primary methods of advocacy.  \n Valerie’s narrative contains numerous examples of micro-level advocacy through verbal \ninteractions and discussion with individuals who are rejecting or ambivalent towards persons of \ndiverse gender identities. Valerie’s reference to micro-level advocacy overlaps the deductive \ntheme of “Micro/Individual Level and Community Level Sources of Affirmation and Support” \nidentified in the literature, and pilot study that preceded this project. Valerie’s use of micro-level \nadvocacy strategies seems to be her primary approach to pursuing social change for this \npopulation, as she uses this method to both address discrimination and to support and affirm the \ngender diverse community. The themes described below relate specifically to Valerie’s \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  78 \n \nexperience as relates to the category of micro-level advocacy, and do not reference those \ndeductive themes described in the literature. \n Sub-themes relating to the theme of micro-level advocacy through discussion include: 1) \nThe act of hearing another’s perspective, 2) providing education, 3) engaging in discussion, and \n4) challenging opinions. These themes were illustrated in Valerie’s response to the interview \nquestion regarding instances of advocacy that were particularly memorable. Her perceived \nidentities are closely related to her ability to engage in this level/form of advocacy, as Valerie \nstates that her discussions with ambivalent/rejecting individuals were usually initiated by the \nindividual who approached her because of their belief that she was “on that side”.  \n1) Hearing Another’s Perspective. One example of Valerie’s use of hearing another’s \nperspective occurred while Valerie was at a continuing education conference for helping \nprofessionals. Valerie states that she managed the vendor table for a non-profit entity she works \nwith and was chatting with the individuals at the neighboring table when an individual \napproached her table and stated, “I think boys are born boys and girls are born girls”. Valerie \ndescribes the individual as “in my age group” and a helping professional. \n Valerie describes feeling appalled, stating “I just found it really interesting that somebody \nwould come up to a table and interrupt a group of people talking and state their opinion loudly. I \nwas really surprised by it”. During the interview, she described her training as a helping \nprofessional as being counter to this individual’s behavior, stating that her graduate-level training \nin health and human services emphasized “cultural competencies” which includes “not stating \nyour biases or putting it out there, keeping your opinions to yourself because it's not necessarily \nright”. While Valerie identifies this helping professional’s rejecting statement as unprofessional \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  79 \n \nand indicative of a lack of cultural competency, she also describes how she and her colleagues \nlistened to the individual’s “opinion” before sharing their own beliefs and providing education.  \n2) Providing Education. During the aforementioned memorable instance, Valerie describes \nherself and her colleagues as responding to the individual’s statement about the gender binary \nwith their own “opinions” and accurate information. She defines this act of education as making \ninformed statements and providing factual information about gender diversity, with the primary \naim of increasing the individual’s understanding of this population and challenging the \nindividual to conceptualize gender as a spectrum (rather than male female binary). Valerie’s \ndescription of another memorable instance of advocacy emphasizes the role of education when \nutilizing discussion to advocate for gender-diverse individuals. \n3) Engaging in Discussion. The non-profit entity Valerie works with is near a residential area. \nAs part of her work with the entity, Valerie frequently walks these streets picking up trash and \nused syringes. She states that keeping the streets clean near the agency is essential to maintaining \namicable relationships with neighboring businesses. The non-profit entity provides some harm \nreduction interventions, to include syringe exchange. Valerie says that despite the availability of \nsyringe disposal and exchange, she sometimes finds used syringes discarded outside the non-\nprofit entity’s building and near neighboring businesses. \n One day while picking trash up off the streets near the building, a gentleman who works \nin the area stopped his car in the street and struck up a conversation with Valerie. Valerie stated \nthat “he was really negative because people left needles” and he said that “these people just want \nattention”. Valerie described engaging the gentleman in conversation, responding by “explaining \nwhy we offer our services, how not all the needles were used for drugs, how we provide services \nfor people to inject their testosterone into their legs, and why we provide a good service where \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  80 \n \nthey don't have to go someplace [to inject] where they feel uncomfortable”. Valerie described \nadvocating through conversation, saying that “I talked to him. I just educated him. By the time \nwe were done he was like really nice about it and he says, ‘maybe I should look into this a little \nmore’…it was a really good conversation”. \n4) Challenging “Opinions”. Both of Valerie’s memorable instances of advocacy include the act \nof hearing someone’s opinion about gender-identity, responding with education, engaging in \ndiscussion, and challenging the rejecting or ambivalent individual’s “opinion”. Valerie’s \nconversation with the man while picking up trash is a perfect example of how she verbally \nchallenges other’s beliefs. Valerie describes her challenging the man, “I asked, ‘do you really \nthink people are doing this to get attention?’. Because one of his opinions was that these people \njust want attention. When I was done he says, ‘no, I guess you're right’”.  \n Valerie’s interaction with the man on the street also provided an example of the role of \nadvocacy in positive change, particularly positive change in the negative attitudes of others \ntowards transgender and gender-expansive persons. In addition to her work with adults, Valerie \nalso reports interacting with adolescents and children through outreach and education efforts \naimed at promoting understanding of gender identity as a spectrum.  \nActs of Advocacy \n Valerie’s advocacy efforts for transgender and gender-expansive youth include many \nfacets and occur in a variety of settings. Over the course of a week, Valerie may spend one day at \na local middle or high school providing an educational workshop about gender identity to \nstudents as part of their health education curriculum, and another day facilitating a support group \nfor for transgender and gender-expansive youth. When working with children and adolescents \nwithin the schools Valerie’s primary aim is to educate about the gender identity spectrum, and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  81 \n \nthe importance of acceptance and inclusion of all gender identities. When working with school \nadministrators, Valerie presents a similar curriculum with additional information about how to \nsupport transgender and gender-expansive students through acceptance, addressing \ndiscrimination and harassment, and ensuring these youth maintain equal access to resources.  \n In addition to the aforementioned individual themes, one major category emerged from \nValerie’s data. This category is best described as “acts of advocacy” and contains a multitude of \nthemes, with each theme describing a specific act or advocacy effort aimed at pursuing or \ncatalyzing social change. The aim of promoting acceptance, addressing discrimination and \nharassment, and ensuring equal access to resources appears to continue as a uniting thread \namong the themes listed within the category “acts of advocacy”. Table 4 outlines the themes \nincluded in the category “acts of advocacy” and provides a summarized description of each \ntheme. Valerie frequently referenced each of the following acts throughout the interview but did \nnot provide context of specific instances where these acts occurred, thus the summarization of \nthese themes in table format seems best fitting. \nTable 4 \nAdvocating for Transgender and Gender Expansive Youth: Summarization of Category “Acts \nof Advocacy” \nThemes Description \nCultivating safety  Ensuring safety of transgender and gender-expansive youth in \nsituations (such as during interactions with administration and peers at \nschool), relationships (to include relationships with family members \nand peers), and when accessing resources (e.g. helping young people \nto find healthcare and behavioral health practitioners that are \naffirming). \nMeeting basic needs Ensuring that youth who are homeless can access those local shelters \nthat will house them according to their gender identity (rather than sex \nassigned at birth). Helping youth who have limited resources obtain \nnecessary hygiene products, clothing, and food. Assisting young \npeople from affirming less resourced families, and those from \nrejecting homes to access healthcare and, if over age 14 (the age of \nconsent in New Mexico) obtain gender transition related medical care \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  82 \n \n(such as hormone blockers, cross-sex hormones, and the enhancement \nof secondary sex characteristics associated with gender identity). \nCollaboration, \neducation and \noutreach \n \nCollaborating with affirming agencies and practitioners, and engaging \nother community agencies \nThrough the non-profit entity, educating providers about services \ntransgender and gender-expansive young people need or reaching out \nto providers to offer educational workshops to help providers become \nmore informed. \nOutreach is described as calling, communicating with individuals or \norganizations to inquire about their interest in further education in \nworking with transgender and gender-expansive community. Outreach \nis also considered a form of networking, linking the advocate with \nproviders who are affirming of the gender-expansive community. \nUsing education (i.e. workshops, sharing information during \ndiscussions) to address attitudinal barriers rooted in lack of \ninformation, and address inability to empathize due to fear and lack of \nknowledge. \nModeling affirming \nattitudes in \neducational settings \nIn educational settings, educators and administrators model positive \naffirming attitudes during educational workshops for young students, \nto include: Asking appropriate questions, listening and remaining \nengaged throughout. \nSupporting students \nin the school \nenvironment \nSupport students as they pursue access to the facilities (e.g. \nbathrooms) of the gender with which they identify, and request \nacknowledgement by teachers and school administration to be \nrecognized by the appropriate name and gender pronouns. \n“Galvanizing others” \nin a group setting \n(responding to \nrejecting or \nambivalent \nperspectives) \nWhile training adults in a group setting to work with transgender and \ngender-expansive youth, responding to an individual’s opinion or \nperspective that is rejecting of transgender and gender-expansive \nindividuals with information/education. The process of hearing \nanother’s rejecting/non-affirming perspective then providing accurate \ninformation that contradicts the individual’s perspective is described \nas “galvanizing” others in the group to maintain a more affirming \nperspective about the transgender and gender-expansive community. \nAddressing legal \nbarriers \nHelping a child and/or their family to address legal concerns; often \ninvolves youth's rights to healthcare, particularly medical \ninterventions and mental health interventions. \n \nMaintaining list of \nresources \nIdentifying local and national agencies, resource centers, healthcare \nand behavioral health providers who are affirming and able/willing to \nprovide gender transition related services; provides transgender and \ngender-expansive youth and their caregivers with referrals for these \nproviders and resources. \nCollaborating with \nparent advocates \nWorking with parents who support and affirm their child’s identity to \naddress instances where the child experiences discrimination. \n \nDiscrimination & Rejection \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  83 \n \n Valerie describes transgender and gender-expansive youth as facing discrimination and \nrejection in numerous forms, perpetrated by family and caregivers, peers and school \nadministrators, and community members (e.g. individuals who live within the same \nneighborhood or town). She defines discrimination as those acts or speech that reinforce the \ngender binary and reject other gender identities. Valerie provides examples of discriminatory \nactions, to include healthcare providers refusing to provide patients with gender-transition related \nservices, or a behavioral health facility requiring patients to disclose whether they “were born \nwith a penis or vagina”. Speech may include statements such as “boys are born boys” or “girls \nare born girls”. The overwhelming message communicated by these acts and words is that of \nrejection, and the stigmatization of gender-expansive identities. \n The category “discrimination and rejection” includes themes related to the forms and \ntypes of rejection and discrimination, and the individuals/organizations who perpetrate such \ndiscrimination. Another prevalent theme within this category is the contrasting perspectives of \nyouth versus older generations regarding gender identity. According to Valerie, the majority of \nyoung people (ranging from early childhood to mid-twenties) seem to be open to individuals \ndefining their own gender identity. Per Valerie: \nThis is what's cool about kids. They seem to be okay with each other. Doesn't matter. It's \nlike if you like me, you like me, if you don't, oh well.  \nValerie describes young individual’s acceptance of diverse gender identities as standing in sharp \ncontrast to the perspectives of persons her age. In response to an interview question about \nbarriers or challenges to advocacy work for this population, Valerie states: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  84 \n \nIt's usually the adults…it's more people my age because that generation is not very open-\nminded, and older people seem to be more. So, it's like my generation seems to have a lot \nof issues. \nThe aforementioned themes are further described in table 5.  \nTable 5 \nAdvocating for Transgender and Gender Expansive Youth: Summarization of Category \n“Rejection and Discrimination” \nThemes Description \nContrasting \nperspectives between \nyouths and adults  \n \nChildren are described as usually having a much more open \nperspective about gender and identity, viewing gender and identity as \nfluid and self-defined, while adults are described as \"opinionated\" and \nseem insistent that all gender-identities must fit the male-female \nbinary. \nInfluence of religion \n \nReligious groups are described as promoting conceptualization of \ngender according to the male-female binary and rejecting those \nidentities that fall outside of the binary. \n \nRejection as the basis \nfor discrimination \nwithin institutions \n(e.g. healthcare, \nbehavioral health) \nProviders (e.g. physicians, mental health providers) refuse to provide \ncare or treatment due to lack of knowledge about gender-diversity and \ngender-transition related care, or personal beliefs about transgender or \ngender-expansive identities. \nFamily and/or \ncaregiver rejection \nSome family members and/or caregivers respond to child’s disclosure \nor presentation of transgender or gender-expansive identity with \nrejection. Rejection may include removal of support, policing of \ngender presentation (reinforcing only behaviors associated with \ngender assigned at birth). \n \nConsequences of Rejection & Discrimination \n The final theme in the category “rejection and discrimination” is the consequences of \nrejection and discrimination. Throughout the interview, Valerie described working with \ntransgender and gender diverse adults whose families failed to provide “that loving environment” \nneeded for typical growth and development, and thus experienced a variety of difficulties in their \nadolescent and adult life. According to Valerie, many of these gender diverse adults experienced \nsexual abuse, emotional neglect or rejection, and the withdrawal of financial support from family \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  85 \n \nmembers during their youth. In the following quote, Valerie describes her personal and \nprofessional experience witnessing the relationship between the trauma of rejection by one’s \nfamily, and negative outcomes such as homelessness, addiction, and mental health concerns: \nNot having that [family] support, most of them don't complete their education. So, they \nare high school dropouts. They have tons of arrests because of soliciting [sex] and street \neconomics. They have drug and alcohol and mental health issues as well because they've \nbeen told they've been wrong all their lives, and it's not medicated or taking care of the \nway that it needs to be, so they're living inside their own heads with this horrible stuff \nthat they've been through. A lot of sexual abuse has happened as well. That's one thing I \nseem to hear a lot about within their families.  \nAffirmation of Gender Diversity \nParent/Caregiver Acceptance \n Although Valerie’s experience paints a bleak picture of the consequences of family \nrejection in early life, Valerie also describes an evolving counter culture of parents accepting and \ncelebrating their gender diverse children. The primary themes in this category include: Parent’s \nefforts to maintain “healthier relationships” with their gender diverse children, and parent’s \ndesire to “not lose their child” to suicide. Just as she attributed some individual’s rejecting \nattitudes towards gender diversity to age and generational beliefs, Valerie also describes \nparent/caregiver acceptance of gender diversity as related to a new generation of parents, “I feel \nlike we have a lot more supportive parents now compared to some of the older people”.  \n Valerie’s experience assisting with facilitation of support groups for gender-diverse youth \nhave provided her with unique insight regarding the perspectives of accepting and affirming \nparents. All of the children involved in the support groups are accompanied by an affirming \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  86 \n \nsupportive parent/caregiver or family member. According to Valerie, affirming parent’s efforts \nto maintain healthy relationships with their gender expansive child(ren) often includes acts of \nadvocacy.  \n One example provided by Valerie was affirming parent’s awareness of the discrimination \ntheir children face while at school. Valerie describes these parents as “fighting the schools more”  \nto address instances of discrimination. Valerie states that parents describe their children \nexperiencing the following difficulties in the school environment: \nit's always a bathroom…and how to get to where kids can use the bathroom of the gender \nthey identify with. Why do they have to be singled out [when using the restroom]? Also, \nteachers using the correct pronouns.  \n Affirming parents not only provide a loving environment and validation of their child’s \nidentity, but also advocate for their children when teachers fail to use the correct pronouns, or \nschools refuse their child to use the restroom that aligns with their gender identity. Valerie \ndescribes the presence of these sources of support as also acting as a protective factor, reducing \nthe likelihood that gender-diverse youth will experience homelessness, addiction, and mental \nhealth concerns.  \nSociopolitical Context \nThe Trump Administration  \n During the interview, Valerie seemed to speak in hushed tones when using politically-\naffiliated words such as “Trump” and “conservative”. Valerie referenced the current political \nadministration, specifically President Trump and his cabinet, throughout the interview. Her \nresponse to almost every interview question included some reference to how President Trump’s \npolitics and policy are negatively impacting LGBTQ youth. Particularly impactful quotes from \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  87 \n \nValerie regarding the effect of the Trump administration and conservative politicians on the \nLGBTQ community include: \nJust knowing who our president is…I'm not a political person by nature, but I suddenly \nam because I am sickened by that man and what he does. It makes my heart ache. I feel \nlike he's promoting genocide.  \nI think he's taken us backwards. I think he's going to be harmful to our youth. I mean if he \ngets his way. So, so it's made me more politically active and really more in tune to what's \ngoing on and how can I be involved to help do my part.  \n Valerie describes the current political climate as acting as a powerful motivator for her, \ninspiring her to pursue positive social change through her advocacy efforts. She describes her \nwork with participants in the Youth Group as particularly impacted by socio-political climate, as \nshe often assists these young people to identify affirming resources and cope with non-affirming \nstatements by politicians. Per Valerie: \nI mean [the political climate has motivated me] to provide more support to the youth. \nLike the [support group for youth]. For them, I try making sure that they're aware of more \nresources for therapy and behavioral health stuff because it really affects them, like when \ncertain changes are made. They hear it and then some of them are right there at that 18, \n19 year old cusp, and some of them don't have families that are providing support so \nthey're homeless.  \n As much as Valerie’s direct statements articulate the impact of politics on gender-diverse \nyouth and her own advocacy efforts, her consistent reference to this contextual variable also \nspeaks volumes about the role of socio-political context on advocacy for this population. Themes \nunder the umbrella category of socio-political context include: Advocate’s personal response \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  88 \n \n(e.g. “I am sickened” and “it makes my heart ache”), rejecting political actions and policies as \nmotivating advocacy efforts, and Trump and politically conservative individuals as “harmful to \nour youth”. \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n The categories and related themes inductively derived from Valerie’s interview \nilluminated Valerie’s personal and professional development as an advocate, her sources of \nmotivation and inspiration, and the many acts and elements of micro-level interactions that \ncomprise advocacy efforts. Other categories described by Valerie include transgender and \ngender-expansive youth’s experience of rejection and discrimination, and the consequences of \nthis rejection. Throughout the interview, her references to the impact of politics on gender \ndiverse youth spoke to the relevance of socio-political context as a category or umbrella concept. \nValerie also described her experience with affirming parents, caregivers, and family members, \nand how these experiences shed light on the positive effects of affirming family members \nadvocating for their gender-diverse child(ren).  \n These categories and themes illustrate how Valerie utilizes her role as advocate to pursue \npositive change for transgender and gender-expansive youth and adults. They also speak to the \ncontextual variables that influence the advocacy process. During the final portion of the \ninterview, Valerie was asked to recommend any advocacy related documents, films, or other \nreferences. Her recommendations provided further contextual information about her experience \nas an advocate, as her recommendations consisted primarily of practical resources for affirming \nhealthcare, behavioral health, and legal resources for transgender and gender-expansive \nindividuals.  \nAdvocacy Artifacts \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES  89 \n \nTowards the end of each interview, participants are asked the following questions: \nAre there any advocacy-related media, such as videos, documentaries, films, books, or \narticles, that you would recommend?

Craig was born in the 1970s and began his work in advocacy during his undergraduate \nstudies when he assisted at a homeless shelter. He states that it was at that time that he began \nworking with LGBTQ youth who were experiencing homelessness and noticed that this \npopulation faced rejection and discrimination from family, community, and society. Craig has a \nMasters in health and human services and works as a human service professional in the state of \nNew Mexico.  \n Craig currently works as a helping professional in New Mexico. His practice is near a \nschool that provides an affirming community for LGBTQ students. Craig’s office is also near a \nyouth center that serves LGBTQ youth. Craig explained that the location of his office has \nenabled his clients to access services such as support groups, youth events, and an affirming \neducational environment. He describes having a number of clients who attend the affirming \nschool during the day, see Craig after school one day a week, then receive services at the youth \ncenter. \n Craig was recruited to participate in the study when, during a conference regarding \nLGBTQ issues for human service providers, Craig attended my presentation about the pilot study \nthat preceded this case study. At the end of the presentation, I asked that any attendees interested \nin participating in future studies on the topic provide their contact information. Craig spoke to \nme after the presentation and indicated that he was interested in sharing about his experience \nworking with LGBTQ youth as a helping professional, and provided a copy of his business card. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 93 \n \nHe was contacted approximately one year later, after the Institutional Review Board approved \nthe current case study. \nInterview Context \n The interview took place in Craig’s office at 8 am on a weekday, prior to Craig seeing \nclients for the day. Since his office is typically used for providing confidential counseling \nservices, the set up of the space provided adequate privacy for the interview. Craig appeared \ncomfortable and open to discussing all topics during the interview. He completed the \ndemographic survey, verbally provided a list of advocacy artifacts, and completed the interview \nin a total of 52 minutes. \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Craig’s interview was transcribed, and the transcript reviewed 5 times. During each \nreading, portions of the text were assigned brief titles based on the major themes identified. \nCategories were then identified based upon similarities among themes. These categories acted as \numbrella concepts explaining a variety of related themes. The following section describes those \ncategories that emerged from the data and their related themes. \nAdvocating as a Helping Professional & Human Service Provider \n As a licensed human services provider working with LGBTQ youth, Craig describes \nworking with a number of transgender and gender-expansive young people and their families. \nAccording to Craig, the role of the helping professional as advocate requires the helping \nprofessional to utilize their role as confidential confidant to provide direct services to the young \nperson that help them to navigate their experience and achieve positive outcomes. Themes under \nthe umbrella of the category “advocating as a helping professional” include micro-level \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 94 \n \nadvocacy efforts, namely: Advocating for youth within their family/caregiving unit, and \naddressing sociopolitical context. \nAdvocating for Youth within the Family/Caregiving Unit \n Craig describes much of his human services work with transgender and gender-expansive \nyouth as almost always including the child’s parents and/or caregivers to some extent. He states \nthat in New Mexico, once a child turns 14 they are able to consent to receive mental health and \nsome medical services without the consent of their parents. Thus when working with clients \nunder the age of 14, Craig always includes the parents/caregivers in the helping process. When \nworking with parents/caregivers, Craig describes his role as advocating for the needs and wants \nof the child. \n Advocating for the transgender or gender-expansive youth when working with the \nparents requires premeditation and strategy. Per Craig, interacting with parents/caregivers \nfollows a specific process or trajectory. This process includes: 1) Normalizing the parent’s \nexperience with the child, 2) navigating parent/caregiver’s expectations for the helping process, \n3) educating parents about the statistics and the stakes concerning their choice to either reject or \naffirm their child’s identity, and 4) holding space for the transgender or gender-expansive child. \n1) Normalizing the parent’s experience with the child. The first step when working with a \ntransgender or gender-expansive minor client and their parent/caregiver is to ensure that the \nparent’s experience is normalized. Per Craig, when first working with the parent, the human \nservice professional ought to:  \nJust kind of normalize it. Saying you're not the only parents who feel this way. That's \noften really helpful.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 95 \n \n Craig describes normalizing as a process whereby the human service professional ensures \nthe parent that their emotional response to their child’s transgender or non-binary gender identity \nis similar to other parents/caregivers in the same situation. Normalizing the parent’s feelings \nabout their child’s identity serves multiple purposes. Normalization helps Craig to meet the \nparents where they are with regards to their rejection, ambivalence or support of their child’s \nidentity. This strategy also helps Craig to build rapport with the family and avoid them not \ncoming “back to [the office]”, by being “gentle” and not going “full force” and challenging their \nworldview with too much education. Per Craig: \nI think like being an advocate in this setting, you have to be gentle. You can't go full \nforce saying, “no, listen, [their gender identity] is perfectly acceptable. This is perfectly \nokay. There's nothing wrong with your child. They're just different. They just have a \ndifferent gender identity than the rest of us”. Just explaining what it means to be \ntransgender is sometimes helpful, but there have been a few times where I’ve had people \ndecide not to come back to [the office] because of that. And I try really hard not to make \nthat happen. So that means going really slow when I try to engage.  \n2) Navigating Parent’s Expectations for Counseling. Craig describes parents/caregivers as \noften bringing their child to his office with pre-conceived notions about what their child is going \nthrough, and what they need to do to feel better. He states that some parents/caregivers are aware \nthat their child is “coming out” to them as being somewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum and are \nseeking assistance to better support their child. He describes other parents/caregivers as being \nunaware of why their child is struggling, and bring their child to therapy in hopes of obtaining \nsome assistance. Craig says that some parents are rejecting of their child’s gender diversity and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 96 \n \nare “under the assumption that I’m going to side with them, and try to make their child un-\ntransgender”. \n Although Craig says that he attempts to be “gentle” with parents to ensure that they keep \ncoming back to the office and continue to allow their child to engage in human service \ninterventions, he draws a hard line with how “gentle” he is willing to be. Craig states that “it's \nnot always completely possible”  to meet parents where they are, particularly rejecting or \nambivalent parents “because I’m not going to separate myself from my own morals”. Craig \ndescribes himself as willing to normalize parents’/caregivers’ negative emotions or rejecting \nresponse to their child’s transgender or gender-expansive identity and will even discuss their \nbeliefs about gender diverse identities, but that he will not go so far as to allow \nparents/caregivers to believe that he approves of their rejecting attitudes or behaviors.  \n No matter the difference in parents’/caregivers’ expectations for human service \ninterventions or beliefs about gender diversity, Craig stated that all parents essentially “bring \ntheir child to get some more information”. By identifying the foundation of his role as a helping \nprofessional and advocate as that of educator, Craig is able to meet the parents/caregivers of his \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth wherever they are in their journey with their child. \n3) Educating Parents. As a helping professional and advocate for transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth, Craig states that educating parents/caregivers about gender identity requires a \ndelicate balance between providing information and gently challenging misinformed beliefs. \nCraig described the primary topic areas where parents require education as: Understanding \ngender identity as a spectrum; the role of hormone therapy and medical transition in treating \ndysphoria and related mental health symptoms; the relationship between lack of congruity \nbetween physical gendered appearance and internal gender identity and mental health symptoms, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 97 \n \nand the role of parental/caregiver rejection or acceptance in transgender or gender-expansive \nchild experience of suicidal ideation.  \n When discussing his approach to educating parents, Craig describes challenging parent \nbeliefs and behaviors that reinforce gender as a binary concept. He states that parents often \nstruggle to allow their child to explore their gender, as many tend to view gender as still male or \nfemale. This belief prevents children from stepping outside of stereotypical gender norms, such \nas boys play with trucks and girls play with makeup, even though both cisgender and transgender \nchildren may not fit stereotypical gender expectations. Thus Craig describes challenging parents \nin the following way: \nIf a kid is transgender, it becomes this real hard and fast rule of what they are going to be \nlike. If it's a Trans feminine child that child should only wear girls’ clothing and put on \nlots of makeup and grow their hair really long and they have to be this stereotypical \nfemale. It can't be a mixture or a combination, or a process of discovery for this child. I \nthink that can be more difficult, and it causes confusion. They'll say stuff like, “Well \nsometimes you like to play with trucks” to the trans feminine boy, or “Sometimes you \nlike to play with transformers”. My whole approach would be to say, “Well yes, but some \ncisgender little girls like to do that too. Is that such a bad thing?”  \nCraig also emphasizes the importance of learning from children, and expanding society’s \ndefinition of gender, viewing gender as a spectrum and a self-defined experience: \nThese children really make us question and look more broadly at these definitions of \ngender and gender identity, and what that means and not making it so binary and not \nmaking it so specific, and pushing that onto our kids.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 98 \n \n Another essential area of education for parents is understanding the role of hormone \ntherapy and medical transition in treating dysphoria and related mental health symptoms. Craig \ndescribes hormone therapy as the use of hormone blockers in children as young as 12, and cross \nsex hormones in the later teen years. Per the World Professional Association for Transgender \nHealth (2011) hormone blockers prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics \nassociated with the child’s natal sex. Hormone therapy also includes the use of cross sex \nhormones (e.g. estrogen for transgender females, testosterone for transgender males), typically \nstarted during late adolescence. Craig discusses the importance of hormone therapy, stating: \nWhat's happening more recently is that they are doing what they call hormone blockers. \nI’ve been noticing a much better trend of this happening, where they start hormone \nblockers as early as 12 years old, and that's so good. It's so, so, so, so helpful. I really \nadvocate for these blockers. It’s part of the advocacy work I do, helping the parents \nunderstand because they do have to consent for these gender treatments or it won't \nhappen.  \nBut the hormone blockers are so great because it prevents the child from not having to go \nthrough a second puberty, which is so challenging and it's such a whirl wind.  \n Craig describes hormone therapy as essential to addressing psychological distress \nassociated with the lack of congruity between internal gendered experience, and external gender \npresentation. He references clients who present to counseling with symptoms of depression and \nthoughts of suicide who, after beginning hormone therapy, have experienced a drastic reduction \nof symptoms. Per Craig, hormone therapy plays a positive role in promoting mental health for \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 99 \n \nIt really helps, from a [human services] perspective. I do basic screenings for depression \nand it is absolutely amazing how the level of depression decreases when a child starts on \nhormones. It's amazing. They can be fairly suicidal, with immobilizing depression, but \nwhen they are on hormones, when they start the process confirming and affirming their \ngender, it's like something just happens. They feel so much better. They're doing \nsomething positive for themselves. Then they feel like they want to stay with the game. \nThey want to keep up with life and keep going.  \n When transgender and gender-expansive youth fail to have their gender affirmed, \nwhether through medical intervention or a lack of parental support, mental health can be \nadversely affected. Per Craig, these youth experience a much higher rate of suicide than their \npeers, and parental rejection of their gender identity seems to be a contributing factor. When \nthese youth are accepted and supported by their parents/caregivers, their risk of experiencing \nsuicidal ideation or attempting suicide decreases. Craig’s statements about increased suicidal \nideation in transgender and gender-expansive youth with rejecting families is validated by \nquantitative studies facilitated by the Family Acceptance Project (Ryan, 2009). Craig describes \neducating parents about the high-stakes of parental acceptance in the following quote: \nTrying to do some education, talking about gender identity. I think what can really help \nparents come to an understanding of their child is to know that transgender youth have a \nvery high rate of suicide, that's much higher than the average teenage population. I think \nthat knowing that, and the fact that if one parent accepts them then that's going to \ndecrease the rate of suicide or the risk of suicide for that particular kid - that really helps. \nI think that most of these parents really love their kids. With rejecting parents, I think \nthey're thinking about the child’s overall life and they don't question the fact that if they \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 100 \n \ndon't receive the support they need - being in such an isolated group, and some having \nreally severe gender dysphoria - if they don't get that type of support, and if they're \nrejected then that can increase the rate of suicide.  \n4) Holding space for the transgender or gender-expansive child. Craig describes his \nadvocacy work with transgender and gender-expansive youth as centered around his role as a \nhuman services provider. He speaks to sitting with his young clients and the “dark things” they \nshare with him. Craig emphasizes the importance of holding space for these young people in the \nfollowing quote: \nIt can be really challenging to work with kiddos and to sit and bear witness to and hear \nabout really atrocious dark things that are going on in somebody's life. This is what \n[human service providers] have to do. We have to like sit with people and be brave with \nthem as they recall traumatic events.  \n Holding space for transgender and gender-expansive youth in the human services/helping \nenvironment also means challenging negative beliefs. Craig describes the negative beliefs these \nyoung people present with in counseling as often originating with the child’s parents and \nconsisting of self-deprecating beliefs about the self. These beliefs include self-statements about \ntheir lack of worth, being “bad” or a “freak”, and not deserving of fair treatment or to have their \ngender acknowledged, all because of their gender identity. In the following quote Craig describes \nchallenging these beliefs as a form of advocacy as he advocates for his clients to harbor more \npositive beliefs about their self and abandon these negative thoughts and patterns: \nThey need to know that they're not a freak. They’re not bad. They're not a bad person. \nThey have worth. They deserve to be treated well. They deserve to have their gender \npronouns respected. I’ve been providing a lot of that support and countering some of \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 101 \n \nthose negative thoughts, patterns, and belief systems that were passed down from their \nparents to them. There's a lot of that in [human services], and that's a way that I advocate \nfor my clients. There's a lot of sort of like working against those negative stereotypes.  \nSociopolitical Context \nThe Trump Administration  \n When asked about whether political climate affects his young transgender and gender-\nexpansive clients, Craig confirms that political changes drastically impact these youth. Craig \ndescribes the transgender and gender-expansive community as at “the precipice…[as they are] \njust barely getting to that place where they are truly recognized by the medical fields, society, \nand the government”. He states that the recognition and affirmation of the transgender \ncommunity by medical, social, and government entities is political progress, but that this is \njeopardized by the current government administration. Per Craig, “[political progress] needs to \nbe taken so much further. But it’s so scary when you have this lunatic elected to office”. In \naddition to the aformentioned views on the Trump administration, Craig’s statements about \nsociopolitical context include the following themes: Transgender is the new gay, and the political \nis personal. \n“Transgender is the new gay” \n According to Craig, “transgender has become the new gay as far as discrimination goes”. \nCraig states that about 15-20 years ago, Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual (LGB) youth were likely to \nbe kicked out of their homes, forced to submit to therapy aimed at changing their sexual \norientation, and rejected by their parents/caregivers because of their identity. He says that today \nthese children are more likely to be accepted by their families and seem less likely to have these \nadverse experiences.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 102 \n \n Craig states that in his experience as a human service provider working with LGBTQ \nyouth, his LGB clients are less likely to be rejected by their families or experience the \naforementioned adverse experiences, while his transgender and gender-expansive clients/patients \nseem more apt to see such negative responses from loved ones. Craig describes the families he \nhas worked with as seeming more open to their child having a non-heterosexual sexual \norientation, but “not okay” with their child being transgender or gender-expansive. He views this \nshift in parent/caregiver/family perspective as reflective of a shift in stigma and discrimination. \nPer Craig, where being gay could cause a child to lose their family’s support, it’s now non-binary \ngender identities that appear to illicit this level of rejection from family members and/or \ncaregivers: \nFifteen to twenty years ago, a lot of kids were kicked out of their house because they \nwere gay or forced to go to some sort of conversion therapy. That still happens in \ndifferent parts of the country with the LGB part of the population. But as far as \ntransgender, non-gender, non-binary, or gender variant folks, they're dealing with that \ncurrently. So now transgender is the new gay, which is kind of a weird way to say it. I \nthink that LGB kids are accepted by their parents much more. That's a more common \nthing. Definitely not all parents, there’s certainly less acceptance with highly religious \nparents as they seem to be more anti-gay. But a lot of parents who are actually very okay \nwith their child being gay, lesbian or bisexual are not okay with them being transgender. \nAnd that's been my experience.  \n Craig describes some “highly religious parents”, and parents/caregivers in “different parts \nof the country” as continuing to reject all LGBTQ identified youth, but states that there remains a \ntrend towards acceptance of LGB youth. The parallel between the historical rejection of LGB \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 103 \n \npersons by institutions, communities, and political leaders and the current rejection of \ntransgender persons is irrefutable. The following theme “political is personal” describes recent \npolitical events and effects on the transgender and gender-expansive community. The events and \ncontext discussed support Craig’s claims that “transgender is the new gay”, as they provide \nevidence of the stigma and oppression once applied to LGB persons, now shifted and applied to \ncommunity members whose gender identity violates the traditional male/female binary. \nPolitical is Personal: Effects of the Trump Administration \n  Craig’s statements are rooted in current American politics. At the time of Craig’s \ninterview, Republican and political conservative Donald Trump had held the office of president \nfor two years. During that time, President Trump had rescinded the Title IX guidance that \nensured that transgender and gender-expansive students received fair treatment in the public \neducation system (U.S. Department of Justice, 2016), attempted to ban persons who are \ntransgender from serving in the military (Levin, 2018), and legally define gender as based on \nphysician’s interpretation of genitalia at birth (Green, Benner, & Pear, 2018). Craig viewed these \npolitical actions as indicative of an anti-LGBTQ agenda and reported feeling fearful and \nconcerned for the safety and wellbeing of his clients, the LGBTQ community, and himself as a \ngay man. \n Craig’s description of how he and LGBTQ members of his community felt following the \n2016 presidential election illustrates the impact of political events on personal experience: \nAfter the presidential election, I was in a really dark place. I’m watching that whole \nthing…it felt a lot like a rollercoaster. The whole week after the election, it was horrible \nfor the youth that I work with. I actually emailed my group [of LGBTQ counseling \ncolleagues and friends] and was like, I feel like I’m in despair here. I don't know what to \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 104 \n \ndo. We kind of encouraged each other through email. There was this big line of \nencouragement. I woke up that morning was like, “Shit”. As a gay man to see somebody \nwho's vague policies regarding transgender issues and gay issues, and then to see the \npeople that president Trump is hiring, who has appointed to all of these major offices, it \nwas so scary. Just the insanity of what happened and what it could possibly mean. \n The aforementioned quote references Craig’s “group” of LGBTQ counseling colleagues \nand friends. During his interview, Craig describes maintaining a group of LGBTQ colleagues \nwho also work with LGBTQ individuals with whom he meets once a month to share resources \nand discuss current events. He describes this group as also communicating frequently via email, \nand that following Trump’s election into office, the group processed the event via email and \nprovided one another with emotional support. Craig’s description of he and his community’s \nresponse to Trump’s election provides a shining example of how advocates for this population \nexperience political events as highly personal. \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Participant Craig’s role as a helping professional seemed to significantly impact his \nconceptualization of his role as an advocate for transgender and gender-expansive youth. \nWorking with these youth within the context of the human services environment provided Craig \nwith a window into how their experience with their families/caregivers affected their mental \nhealth, and enabled Craig to advocate on behalf of the child within the family. His role as a \nhelping professional also afforded him the opportunity to see how political climate and events \nimpacts this population. It was during our discussion of the impact of political context on \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth that Craig explained how he as a gay man, and his \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 105 \n \nLGBTQ colleagues have also been personally affected by the current conservative LGBTQ-\nhostile presidential administration.  \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n The aforementioned themes speak to how Craig’s advocacy efforts are inextricably tied \nto his professional role, and socio-political context. The advocacy artifacts Craig recommends \nalso seem strongly tied to his role as a human services professional. When responding to the \ninterview question requesting recommendations for advocacy artifacts, Craig recommended \nprimarily resources that his clients/patients had accessed and found helpful, or that his colleagues \nhad recommended. These artifacts are listed in the following table, and include the artifact type, \nCraig’s description of the artifact, and a brief description of the artifact from its original source. \nThe Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico was mentioned by Craig but was also \npreviously mentioned by another participant and included in their advocacy artifacts table, thus \nthis artifact was not included in the table. \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 106 \n \nTable 7 \nRecommended Advocacy Artifacts – Craig \nArtifact Title  \n \nArtifact Type Participant Description Summary Description from Source  \nNate Sharon, MD \nPsychiatry \nUniversity of New \nMexico \nHealthcare \nprovider \n“Nate Sharon has been like a \nreally awesome person in New \nMexico.

She reports her \nhighest level of education is a high school diploma, and her current income as between $35,000-\n$49,999. Bobbie works as a bartender and hair dresser. \n In her free time Bobbie acts as a community organizer and fundraiser for local LGBTQ \ncommunity events. Bobbie is also a board member for a non-profit agency, and volunteers with \nlocal non-profits that assist persons experiencing homelessness. Her work in the community has \nincluded fulfilling a mentorship role with transgender and gender-expansive youth, and young \nLGBTQ persons participating in drag shows and related events. \n I became acquainted with Bobbie during an LGBTQ youth event she coordinated. After \nseeing Bobbie at several other LGBTQ community events, I asked her if she would be willing to \nparticipate in a 1 hour interview to discuss her experiences as an advocate. Bobbie agreed to \nparticipate in the study and invited me to complete the interview at her place of work – a bar \nowned and operated by a member of the LGBTQ community.  \nInterview Context \n Bobbie and my interview occurred at about 5 pm on a Friday, before Bobbie began her \nshift at work. We sat in the lounge area under a huge disco ball and variety of colored lights and \nprojection equipment. Two club employees were also in the building at the time of the interview, \nbut Bobbie stated that she felt comfortable with their being in and out of the space during the \ninterview and that there was adequate privacy.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 109 \n \n Prior to the interview, when I saw Bobbie at events she was always dressed in full drag, \ncomplete with big beautiful hair, dramatic make up, and perfectly coordinated outfits. During the \ninterview, Bobbie wore sweats and a t-shirt, her hair in a pony tail and no make-up. Before \nbeginning the interview, she described how self-conscious she sometimes feels when she has not \nstyled her hair or applied make-up, as she feels that the signs of aging are more evident and she \nis less likely to pass as female. She defined “passing” as the likelihood that someone “walking by \non the street” sees you as the gender you identify with and present as, rather than seeing the \nperson as the sex assigned at birth, or as transgender. Bobbie described passing as more an issue \nof safety than of her “caring what other people think”. \n After briefly catching up, Bobbie and my interview began. The interview lasted a total of \n82 minutes, running about 20 minutes over the 60 minutes slated for the interview. Bobbie and I \nspent this additional time discussing how Bobbie’s personal experience with homelessness, \naddiction, sex work, and family rejection impacted her development as an advocate for \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth. Her personal story and narrative seemed intertwined \nwith her growth as an advocate and activist, as she describes herself as engaging in “trans \nactivism work for probably 20 years”. \n Over the course of the interview, Bobbie’s response to several of the interview questions \nincluded references to my experience as the parent of a transgender child. It seemed that my \nacceptance of my transgender child, and advocacy efforts to support her, had left an impression \non Bobbie. Her pre-existing beliefs about me as a parent and LGBTQ ally seemed to affect how \nshe responded to my interview questions, and her willingness to be vulnerable with her sharing. \nAlthough I cannot know how Bobbie would have responded during the interview if she had not \nknown me previously, I do believe that she was more willing to discuss intimate details of her \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 110 \n \npast because she felt comfortable with me as a friend/acquaintance. The following quotes are \nexamples of the impact of my relationship with Bobbie on the information she shared during the \ninterview: \nYou've been accepting. You're breaking the cycle for Zelda, but most of us were \ntormented and picked on all through high school. We come out and people don't want to \nhave sex with us. When we are being used, we don't understand what being used is \nbecause we're 19. Do you know what I mean? Then I realize that I’m 24 years old and I \nhave AIDS and I was just used. There's just a lot of animosity that many of us have never \ndealt with.  \nWe [transgender people] come into the adult world damaged. We never fixed ourselves. \nThe majority don't ever get fixed. We get used and end up with diseases from being used. \nIt's just a brutal world. Hopefully you break that cycle with Zelda. I know she is picked \non in school, but hopefully she's confident enough in herself that she can tell you, and she \ncan tell them to fuck off.  \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n The coding process revealed three major categories: 1) Bobbie’s development as an \nadvocate, 2) the acts of advocacy in which Bobbie engaged, and 3) the sociopolitical context of \nBobbie’s advocacy efforts and experience. Each category contained a variety of themes related to \nBobbie’s lived experience as an advocate for transgender and gender-expansive youth. The \nsection that follows outlines the primary themes within each category, and their relationship to \nexisting literature. \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nThe Influence of Previous Transgender Female Activists \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 111 \n \n Bobbie describes the transwomen of previous generations as creating the current climate \nwhere she (Bobbie) and other transgender and gender-expansive individuals can present as their \nauthentic selves. She describes Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and other transgender and \nqueer people who fought during the Stonewall Riots as contributing greatly to the transgender \nrights movement. Regarding the contributions of previous transgender women, Bobbie stated, \n“They fought and struggled. Just living as a Tran’s person is a rebellion. They went through a \nlot”. Bobbie’s statement emphasizes that a transgender individual’s visibility as a transgender \nperson is in and of itself an act of “rebellion”, or act of advocacy for the right of transgender \npersons to live as their authentic selves. \n Regarding her own direct experience with transwomen of previous generations, Bobbie \nstates that when she first came out as trans, “older trans women” were the only people to \nadvocate for her. She says that their generation believed trans women could “only be a \nhairdresser or a bartender or a prostitute”. She describes the lives of the transwomen before her \nas fraught with violence – from law enforcement, to “johns” or customers of sex work. One such \nexample of the violence experienced by these women is evident in the story of “Momma Val”: \nI was talking to the one named Momma Val. They used to wear these elaborate wigs only \nbecause they could put razor blades in them so that when the cops would grab them – the \ncops would grab them and try to steal their money because they were turning tricks – they \nwould grab the razor blades. The cops would let them turn tricks and try to get their \nmoney from them. Val had those razor blades in her hair. It was a very, very violent time.  \n Bobbie describes herself as being steeped in this violent environment as a young \ntransgender woman, not always recognizing the danger around her. She says that during her early \n20s she moved from New Mexico to California. While working the streets one night, an older \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 112 \n \ntranswoman warned Bobbie that the time and place Bobbie was attempting to work was \ndangerous and that she needed to “be safe and work a friendly freeway”. This other woman told \nBobbie “You don't need to be out on the streets with us right now. It's too dangerous for you. \nYou are from a small town”. Bobbie further describes her experience engaging in sex work in \nSanta Monica: \nEven talking about it, when I picture it in my head, it's like I’m watching a movie. I can't \nbelieve I lived that life. Like I was out there doing those crazy things. I was, because I \nwas strung out, and I didn't know no better, and if she wouldn't have told me anything I \nwould have gotten in cars with people right there. \n Although living and working on the streets meant confronting a number of dangers, \nBobbie says that she and other transgender women built a “survival mode type of community” \nwhere they ensured each other’s basic safety: \nWe didn't have the community back then. We had a community where we made sure we \nwere alive, generally fed, and that we had some place to sleep inside, even if it was a \nroom where there were eight girls stuffed on the floor. We had that kind of a community. \nIt was just survival, a survival mode type of community. \n Bobbie’s connection to those transgender women who bravely presented to the world as \ntheir authentic selves seems to have strongly influenced her identity as an advocate. She \ndescribes these women as teaching her how to survive and remain resilient in a world that is \nhostile towards transgender people. Her experience with these women also highlights the \nprevalence of discrimination, rejection, and hate towards persons who traverse the male female \ngender binary. \nComing Out and Becoming an Advocate \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 113 \n \n For Bobbie, coming out as transgender to her family was an integral part of her \ndevelopment as an advocate. She describes growing up “on a military base, very sheltered”, \ninforming her family of her gender identity in her late teens early 20s. Bobbie says that her \nfamily “didn't understand”, and that “there was no one to back then in the early nineties that \nadvocated for me. You did it for yourself or your drag family did it for you”. Later in the \ninterview, Bobbie references her “drag family” as her “trans family” and defines this form of \nfamily as chosen family consisting of those persons who were transgender and supportive of her \nand other members of the LGBTQ community. For Bobbie, coming out meant losing the support \nof her biological family and developing a new chosen family within the LGBTQ community. \n Presenting as her authentic self, Bobbie has experienced uncomfortable situations when \ninteracting with her biological family. She described these interactions as centered around her \nfamily member verbalizing some discriminatory belief about the LGBTQ community, and \nBobbie responding in such a way as to advocate for her community and transgender identity. \nAccording to Bobbie, advocating for the transgender community when interacting with her \nfamily means: \nJust being loud and being vocal, and sometimes being uncomfortable in an uncomfortable \nsituation. You're talking to people who are your family, your blood family - your cousins, \naunts and uncles. They say they love you but then they're pro-Trump so they can't \nrealistically be supportive. It's very awkward.  \nPowerlessness \n Bobbie’s drive to be vocal about transgender rights and to advocate for transgender youth \nseems rooted in her own experience of powerlessness in coming out to her biological family, and \nbeing unable to stop the oppression and discrimination perpetuated by rejecting and/or hateful \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 114 \n \npersons. Her sense of powerlessness regarding the rejection of her biological family and the \noppression she has experienced within society appears to parallel the powerlessness she \nconfronts through her advocacy work. Bobbie describes her advocacy work as confronting this \nsense of powerlessness in the following quotes: \nA lot of the stuff I do is because I feel powerless. I feel powerless. How can I stop Trump \nfrom removing protections for trans kids? I’m going to do something. I’ve gotta do \nsomething. \nWe're all in it together. A lot of time I just felt powerless. How to help? How do you \nhelp? There's nothing you can do. Absolutely nothing except being vocal.  \nActs of Advocacy \nYouth Events \n Although Bobbie reports engaging in advocacy and activism for transgender rights \nconsistently over the last 20 years, she stated that she only recently began advocating specifically \nfor transgender and gender-expansive youth. When asked how she became involved with efforts \nto support transgender youth, Bobbie stated: \nI kinda just fell into it. My first thing that was specifically for youth was right after the \npresident removed the Title IX protections for Trans and GNC [Gender Non-\nConforming] kids in school. I thought it was very important that we reach out to the \nyounger generation. Let them know that we're here. So just by force of politics I guess. \n Bobbie’s youth events were funded through fundraisers facilitated during LGBTQ \ncommunity events.  \n One specific event, held for transgender and gender expansive youth, was funded by \ndonations obtained during LGBTQ community events. Although the event was intended for \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 115 \n \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth, it was open to multiple generations of transgender and \ngender-expansive individuals. Bobbie stated that while planning the event she elected to invite \nall transgender community members. Her rationale was that the presence of adult transgender \npeople would show the youth in attendance that transgender persons can be successful, have \nintimate partnerships, families, and build careers. She stated that she also intended the event to \nshow transgender and gender-expansive youth that the transgender community supported them \nand did not condone the Trump administration’s recension of the Justice Department’s Title IX \ninterpretation. \n Bobbie described the youth event as also having unexpected consequences, particularly \non the “older” generations of transgender and gender-expansive persons present. Per Bobbie: \n[A leader from a non-profit entity] said, “well, I don't know about mixing all the \ngenerations of trans people together”. I said, “we'll find out”. But I think the older people \nliked it better than the younger ones! We were crying afterwards, saying, “oh my God!”, \njust seeing Zelda and Amber. \n The aforementioned quote speaks to the emotional experience of the adult attendees of \nthe Stand up for Trans Youth event when interacting with two transgender/gender-expansive \nkids, Zelda (age 8) and Amber (age 3, name changed to protect identity). Bobbie’s effort \nprovided transgender and gender-expansive youth with support and validation and introduced \nmany of the youth to the adult LGBTQ community. The event also seemed to inspire the adult \nLGBTQ community members in attendance by connecting them with youth as young as 3 and 8 \nyears of age, youth who were bravely living as their authentic selves. Bobbie’s youth event is a \nshining example of how one advocate can mobilize financial resources and community support \nto provide transgender/gender-expansive youth with a safe, validating, and inspiring experience. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 116 \n \nSociopolitical Context \nThe Trump Administration \n All of the themes identified in Bobbie’s interview transcript have political context as a \ncentral variable, with the influence of the Trump administration consistently referenced. Bobbie \ndescribed her entry into youth advocacy as initiated “by force of politics”, specifically by her \nanger and sense of powerlessness upon learning of the Trump administration’s recension of the \ninterpretation of the Title IX guidelines. She states that her fundraising for the transgender and \ngender-expansive youth event was a direct response to her feeling “powerlessness” after the \nelection of Trump as president. Bobbie also describes her rejection by her biological family as \nintensified by their support of president Trump, as Trump’s policies directly negatively impact \nBobbie and her community, thus her biological family’s support of the president means they are \n“anti-trans”. \nConsequences of Oppression \n The connection between Bobbie’s journey as an advocate and sociopolitical context is \nalso present in Bobbie’s experience of oppression. As a transgender person, Bobbie has \nexperienced social discrimination and rejection because of her gender identity. This oppression is \ncorrelated with low socioeconomic status, substance use, street economics or “underground \neconomy experiences” (James et al., 2016) and homelessness, all of which Bobbie reports \nstruggling with during her young adulthood. Bobbie’s experience with the aforementioned social \nproblems provide just one example of the adverse effects of oppression. Homelessness, \nsubstance use, street economics, and low socioeconomic status impact the transgender \ncommunity at a much higher rate than the general United States (U.S.) population. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 117 \n \n According to the U.S. Transgender Health Survey (James et al., 2016) (n = 27,715) 29% \nof respondents from the transgender community reported illicit substance use, a rate three times \nhigher than that of the U.S. population. The survey also determined that 15% of respondents \nwere unemployed, a rate three times higher than that of the general population, and 29% were \nliving in poverty, a rate twice that of the U.S. adult population. A total of 23% of respondents \nreported experiencing homelessness during the last year, and 12% of the sample reported \nengaging in “income-based sex work” as part of the underground economy over the course of \ntheir lifetime. The results of the Transgender Health Survey and Bobbie’s lived experience \nillustrate the ill effects of oppression and discrimination against the transgender and gender-\nexpansive community. \nSocial Pressure and In-Group Politics \n Another aspect of oppression present in Bobbie’s interview is the internalized social \nnorms regarding gender identity that are perpetuated by members of the transgender community. \nBobbie describes members of the trans community as pressuring one another to be “passable”. \nPassing is defined as one’s ability to present as the gender with which one identifies while \nappearing cisgender. According to Roen (2002), persons who are transgender may make efforts \nto pass in order to avoid prejudice and transphobia, and threats to personal safety. Passing has \nbecome a politically charged issue within the trans community as it sometimes viewed as hiding \none’s identity, and “may pose a risk to other transpeople, maintaining them in isolation and \nfailing to provide supportive models or networks for future generations” (Roen, 2002, p. 504).  \n Some individuals within the transgender community view passing as denying their \ntransgender identity by attempting to appear cisgender, and thus perpetuating the male/female \ngender binary that is often the basis of transphobia and oppression. Other members of the \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 118 \n \ncommunity seem to value passing and exclude those members of the community who fail to pass \n(Roen, 2002). Bobbie speaks to the tension within the trans community regarding passing, stating \nthat the community’s emphasis on passing is the result of the internalization of oppressive social \nexpectations: \nWe put a lot on ourselves as a Trans community. I’m not sure if you see it with your \ninteractions, but we put so much into having to be passable. We have to be this we have \nto be that, but we don't have to. You've seen it. Is society making us feel like that? \nThere’s a whole sea of stuff that we're processing and we make it hard on ourselves and \non each other. \n Members of the trans community who expect all trans persons to pursue being passable \nas cisgender male or female also seem to have ascribed to the male female gender binary. Bobbie \ndescribed this view of gender as being problematic within the trans community, as it promotes \nthe idea that all trans people ought to: 1) Identify as male or female (rather than viewing gender \nas a spectrum and self-defined), and 2) engage in medical interventions to physically transition to \ntheir accurate gender. Bobbie stated that she disagrees with both of these beliefs as each \nindividual is on their own journey and defines their gender identity in their own way. According \nto Bobbie: \nWe're forcing people to have to fit into the blue and pink as trans people. I’ve met Trans \npeople who say, “Well I am further along with my gender transition”. No, there is no \nroadmap. There's no end of the road, and the older I get the more I see it. I have never \nhad any surgeries and that doesn't make me less trans than people that have had a million \ndollars’ worth of surgery. They're not further along than I am. It’s not a race. It's not a \ndistance. It's not a something measurable like that. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 119 \n \n The category “sociopolitical context” is particularly relevant in Bobbie’s experience as an \nadvocate for transgender and gender-expansive youth as it was “force of politics” that inspired \nBobbie to become an advocate, and politics continues to act as a motivating factor for her work. \nNumerous aspects of Bobbie’s lived experience have been significantly impacted by the social \nand political realities that affect the transgender community. Bobbie’s narrative not only spoke to \nthe adverse effects of oppression on the individual, but also illustrated the impact of internalized \nstigma on the interactions between persons within the transgender community. \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n The coding process revealed themes related to those factors which influenced Bobbie’s \ndevelopment as an advocate, to include the impact of the lives and work of previous transgender \nwomen, her own personal coming out process, and experience of powerlessness. This process \nalso provided insight regarding Bobbie’s motivations and process when facilitating community \nevents for transgender and gender-expansive youth. After multiple reviews, Bobbie’s narrative \nrevealed one consistent common thread – the role of sociopolitical context in her development as \nan advocate, experience of oppression, and social pressure (also referred to as “internalized \nstigma”) within the transgender community. The following section provides an overview of the \nadvocacy artifacts recommended by Bobbie. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n Bobbie seemed to define advocacy artifacts as those films, spaces, or resources that \naccurately depict or contribute to the transgender community’s fight for equal rights. A major \ntheme among the artifacts described by Bobbie are their attention to social justice and activist’s \nefforts. Table 8 outlines the advocacy artifacts recommended by Bobbie, to include the title, \ntype, Bobbie’s description of the artifact, and a summary description of the item from the source. \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 120 \n \nTable 8 \nRecommended Advocacy Artifacts - Bobbie \nArtifact Title  \n \nArtifact Type Participant Description Summary Description from Source  \nLife and Death of \nMarsha P.

She was born in the late 1970s and spent her childhood in the southern United States. \nSuzanne states that her parents were “very conservative” and that she was: \nRraised with half of my family being [religious] and the other half not. The side that is \nnot [religious] is the issue as these are people who were in the clan, and I was expected to \nbe nice to them and be polite because they love me, but I was taught to not talk too much \nabout being [religious]. \n At this time in her life, Suzanne describes herself as having the resources and privilege \nnecessary to advocate for change and have her voice heard. \n Suzanne currently resides in the northeast United States/New England and describes her \nstate as having more progressive policies and “senators and congress people who are woke” \n(“woke” meaning aware of social justice related issues), particularly when compared to the more \nsouthern states in the U.S. Suzanne has a PhD and works as an educator and researcher in higher \neducation, describing her annual income as between $50,000 and $74,999. Her professional work \nfocuses on understanding the experience of transgender and gender-creative children and \nadvocating for this population. Suzanne describes herself as a lifelong feminist, whose \ntransgender child inspired her to pursue research and advocate for transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth. \n I became acquainted with Suzanne when, after my own transgender daughter socially \ntransitioned in October of 2016, I found Suzanne’s research regarding transgender youth and \nreached out to her. Suzanne responded to my inquiry, recommending resources and asking \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 124 \n \nwhether I would like to participate in her research study. After participating in an interview for \nher study, Suzanne and I remained in contact. When I started recruiting participants for this \nresearch, I reached out to Suzanne to ask if she would be willing to serve as a participant, and \nshe agreed. Her unique perspective as a mother, researcher and educator, and advocate \ncontributed incredibly rich data with diverse themes. \nInterview Context \n The interview occurred via phone, Suzanne’s preferred method of communication. The \ngeographical distance between Suzanne and myself made an in-person interview impossible, and \nshe did not feel comfortable using the Zoom online platform. I facilitated the interview from my \noffice at the Women’s Resource Center on the University of New Mexico main campus, and \nSuzanne completed the interview from her home office. The interview occurred during the late \nafternoon and lasted 58 minutes. Suzanne completed the demographic questionnaire in Microsoft \nword and submitted it via email. \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n During the coding process, a number of highly related categories were identified. The end \nresult was the differentiation of 3 umbrella categories, with all themes containing some reference \nto sociopolitical context, even though the final category speaks directly to the role of \nsociopolitical context in Suzanne’s advocacy efforts. The 3 categories that emerged from \nSuzanne’s data include: 1) Personal and professional development as an advocate, 2) acts of and \nmotivations for advocacy, and the role of sociopolitical context, and 3) the costs and \nconsequences of visible advocacy for transgender and gender-expansive youth. \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nDefinition of Advocacy \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 125 \n \n Suzanne’s definition of advocacy seemed to evolve as she worked to meet the needs of \nher transgender child Danny (name changed for privacy). For Suzanne, advocacy consists of her \nactions as a mother to ensure her daughter’s safety and wellbeing in school and extracurricular \nactivities (visible advocacy), and Danny’s own efforts to advocate for herself (self-advocacy). \nChild Self-Advocacy. Suzanne describes Danny as identifying as a female at age 3, but being \n“very reserved, very quiet, very, very quiet, retiring, passive and gentle”, so much so that Danny \nwould not correct others when they referenced her using the incorrect pronouns. When Danny \nwas 6-7 years old, she began correcting people when they failed to use the correct gender \npronouns, to include family members who were unsupportive of Danny’s gender identity. Per \nSuzanne: \nMy parents were not forthcoming with their support, which is not surprising, but they \nwould constantly say “he” and then make a big deal about it, saying “oh, I mean she!”. \nDanny would just melt into the floor. Finally one day Danny said, “no mamaw it's ‘she’”, \nand that stopped it. \nVisible Advocacy. Suzanne describes engaging in “visible advocacy” beginning when her \ndaughter Danny socially transitioned at age 4. One example of this aspect of Suzanne’s advocacy \nwas a letter she created for Danny’s teachers and school nurse stating, “Danny is transgender and \nthis is what it means, and what we expect”. Suzanne stated that she provided this letter at the \nbeginning of each school year to ensure that Danny’s identity was respected, and she was \nreferenced using the appropriate pronouns. \n Suzanne states that visibility is essential when advocating for transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth, as it ensures that “it’s not just my child who benefits”. She describes using her \nstatus as an educator, her literally “loud” voice, and she and her husband’s physical presence as a \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 126 \n \nmeans of ensuring that her child – and other transgender and gender-expansive children - are safe \nand respected. The following quote further describes the visibility of Suzanne’s efforts in her \nown words: \nPart of my approach is visible advocacy. I don't know anybody that would cross me \npersonally, because I’m so visible. I cry easily, but I think the fact that I’m an [educator] \nin [higher education] and I’m loud and very vocal, and physically very large, and I have \nthis gigantic six foot four husband…I think I take up a lot of space both physically and \nsocially. The fact that I am proactive and I know what I’m doing, and I make a lot of \nnoise about my child - I don't think anybody would touch that child. So the good part \nabout that is it's not just my child who benefits. \n Suzanne describes her ability to have her voice heard as a matter of privilege, privilege \nshe receives because of her access to financial resources, her status as an educator, and her \nunderstanding of the rules and policies that affect transgender and gender-expansive youth. This \nprivilege, and her ability to affect change seem to motivate Suzanne to pursue positive social \nchange for this population. \nActs of Advocacy, Motivations for Advocacy, & the Role of Sociopolitical Context \n During the interview, Suzanne frequently described both her motivations and methods for \npursuing positive change within the same narrative. Those factors that inspired her seemed \ninextricably intertwined with her advocacy efforts making the differentiation between the \ncategories “acts of advocacy” and “motivation for advocacy” rather difficult. The organization of \nSuzanne’s case portrait parallels the flow of her narrative, with examples of advocacy efforts \ndescribed alongside her stated motivations for her approach. Also, rather than attempt to separate \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 127 \n \nsociopolitical context as a standalone category, I include the sociopolitical context of Suzanne’s \nadvocacy efforts and motivations with each listed theme.  \nCatalyzing Change for Others \n Suzanne describes not only advocating for change for her daughter, but for all \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth, particularly those whose voices are silenced by social \noppression. Her desire to pursue change seems motivated by the injustice experienced by those \ndisenfranchised transgender and gender-expansive children and their parents. Suzanne describes \nadvocating visibly and loudly:  \nBecause after me comes the quiet parent, or the parent who doesn't speak English, or who \nis disenfranchised for whatever reason and has a transgender child. They can walk in our \nfootsteps a little bit. That lays the path for other people. This is the advocacy, it starts \nwith your child, but never ends with your child. \n Suzanne also describes advocating in environments where change will not directly impact \nher child but may help others in the LGBTQ community. One example of this form of advocacy \noccurred when Suzanne went to for a chiropractic appointment. Suzanne states that once in the \noffice she “noticed on their wall they had a nondiscrimination policy that did not include sexual \norientation or gender identity”. When she questioned a staff member about the lack of inclusion \nof gender and sexual orientation in their nondiscrimination policy, the staff member stated “oh \nwell we just haven't updated it”. Suzanne says that she used her privilege to advocate for change \nin that moment by doing the following: \nI said, “well, I’m not going to be a client here until you update it”, and I stood there until \nthey changed it and printed out a new one because it matters to be able to point to the \nsign on the wall. I’m a middle aged lady. In some ways, I’m invisible. I’m at that point in \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 128 \n \nmy life where I can go ahead and be ugly and it doesn't matter because that's what people \nexpect, and that's what I should be doing with that power. I made a big stink and made a \nlot of people really mad that were behind me in line waiting for them to retype that \ndocument. I’m not the one who benefits from it.  \n“Giving Bigots Consequences” & the Power of Social and Political Context \n A couple of generations back, members of Suzanne and her husband’s family were \nmurdered during the Holocaust. This trauma significantly impacted how both Suzanne and her \nhusband respond to acts of hate, and the lessons they teach Danny and their other children about \nresponding to those who perpetuate hate. Suzanne describes she and her husband’s approach to \ninteracting with family who are unsupportive of Danny’s gender identity in the following quote: \nMy husband’s whole family was slaughtered in the Holocaust. So he believes you \nmaintain relationships with family no matter the price you have to pay. I tell the girls this \nis the way it is [with unsupportive family]. You can make your choices, you can still love \nthem, but you need to remember what they did to you.  \n Suzanne emphasizes the importance of holding those who perpetuate hate accountable. \nHolding those persons accountable who support a system and government which oppresses the \ntransgender and gender-expansive community is itself a method of advocacy. Suzanne views \nsystems level change, particularly within the U.S. government, as essential to improving the lives \nof transgender and gender-expansive youth. Suzanne’s belief in holding individuals accountable, \nand the need for systems level change is evident in her statements about the “price” of supporting \nhate, and the need for “consequences” for “bigots”:  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 129 \n \nThe idea that you can vote for Trump and support what he does, and then turn around and \nenjoy the love of your grandchildren. That's just not going to happen. There is a price, \nthere's a price. \nI think that if people had given the old bigots and their families consequences, we would \nnever be in this mess. If people did not allow their family members to denigrate their \ntransgender children or denigrate transgender adults or gay and lesbian adults in front of \nthem, then things would be different. If you don't give people consequences and shame, \nthey're going to just do whatever they want.  \nIn line with this thinking, Suzanne describes the importance of advocating for change, even when \nit means not being “nice”: \nWe got into this mess with Trump because white women were too nice. I’m a nice \nperson. I’m a nice Jewish lady. Nice middle-aged lady with gray hair. But I’m over being \nnice. We need to give bigots consequences.  \n Suzanne draws a parallel between the inaction to stop acts hate and injustice against \ntransgender and gender-expansive persons in the U.S. and German citizens’ failure to attempt to \nstop the murder of the Jewish people during the Holocaust. In the following quote, Suzanne \ndescribes a conversation between herself and a German woman she met while working abroad: \nI think that giving bigots consequences is very, very important. Rather than just saying, \n“oh, it doesn't matter”, because it does matter. I do a lot of work in Germany and I was \njust there a couple weeks ago. While I was visiting with some people I started talking \nwith this very old woman. She told me my German was good, but not that good. She told \nme, “I would give anything to be able to wash my hands of the crime of having supported \nHitler all those years ago”. She was in the Band of German Maidens, which is the Hitler \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 130 \n \ngirl’s wing [of the Nazi Youth movement] when she was younger. She didn't have much \nchoice. But you always have a choice. You always have a choice on whether or not you \nturn your back and put your support behind hate. You have to live with it forever. So I do \nthink all of us should pitch in giving bigots consequences.  \n Suzanne’s experience during her conversation with the German woman – hearing the \nwoman’s regret about supporting a man who perpetrated so many acts of hate – highlights \nSuzanne’s belief in the need for change. Suzanne’s connection to the trauma and loss \nexperienced by previous generations of her family during the holocaust seems to act as a \nmotivating factor for her pursuit of social change for transgender and gender-expansive youth. \nShe views the rights of transgender and gender-expansive individuals as a “human rights issue”, \nand believes it is the role of the advocate to hold bigots accountable. \nCurrent Social & Political Context: Transgender Rights are Human Rights \n In addition to the parallels drawn between Hitler’s reign in Germany and the current \nTrump administration, Suzanne also notes the similarities between fighting for the rights of the \ntransgender community, and the historical civil rights movement. She describes the U.S. \ngovernment voting on issues that determine whether transgender and gender-expansive children \nreceive the same protections as cisgender children as essentially deciding “whether or not my \nchild is a person”. As an advocate and parent of a transgender child, Suzanne states “Nobody \ngets to vote on whether or not my child is a person”. \n Suzanne states that human rights issues should not be up for debate, as human rights \nshould be inevitable rights afforded to everyone no matter their identity. In the following quotes, \nSuzanne further articulates this belief and describes the role of freedom of speech and religion in \nthe human rights debate: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 131 \n \nNobody gets to vote on human rights issues. Like how everybody got to sit around and \nvote on whether or not gay people can get married. That's a state benefit. That's nothing \nto do with your precious God. It's a state benefit that has tax benefits and has a real \nimpact on financial wellness and access to retirement. Nobody should vote on civil rights \nand human rights issues.   \nIt's not that nobody gets to voice their opinion. They say, “but free speech!”. You can \nwad that up and you can shove it, because you don't get to have an opinion about whether \nor not my child has a right to exist and access healthcare. You don't get to have an \nopinion on that. You can have an opinion on whether or not the sky is blue, and that \ndoesn't change anything, but you don't get to have an opinion about my child or anyone \nelse's child’s access to basic human rights, and freedom from being pummeled to death at \nschool.  \n The second of the aforementioned quotes goes beyond merely describing Suzanne’s \nperspective about the human rights debate and articulates the consequences of disallowing \ntransgender and gender-expansive persons to have basic rights and equal access to resources. \nSpecifically, Suzanne mentions trans youth’s “freedom” to not be “pummeled to death at \nschool”; this reference speaks directly to the results of the GLSEN school climate survey \n(Kosciw et al., 2014), which indicated that trans and gender-expansive youth experience higher \nrates of physical violence at school motivated by perpetrators’ hateful beliefs about these youth’s \ngender identity. Suzanne’s statements speak to the consequences of allowing politicians to make \ndecisions about the rights of transgender people and allowing hate speech in the name of free \nspeech and freedom of religion. \nConsequences & Costs: “The other side of advocacy” \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 132 \n \n As a researcher and parent, Suzanne’s advocacy efforts for gender-expansive youth have \nhad great personal and professional costs. Suzanne describes those members of her extended \nfamily who are unsupportive of Danny’s gender identity as ostracizing her, her children, and her \nhusband. She says that her parents have gone so far as to remove themselves from her life. \nSuzanne attributes her family’s behavior to both their rejection of Danny’s gender identity, and \nto Suzanne’s intolerance of family member’s discriminatory remarks towards the transgender \ncommunity. Suzanne describes this rejection as “the other side of advocacy” in the following \nquote: \nI think advocacy is difficult because there's a cost. It certainly would've been easier for \nme just to go ahead and pretend I hadn't heard their [discriminatory] comments. And then \nI would have parents. Because now I’m an orphan, I have zero family and nobody speaks \nto me. But I’m happy to pay that price if that's the other side of advocacy.  \n Suzanne also discusses experiencing work-related consequences for her advocacy efforts, \nas much of her research and professional work focuses on supporting transgender and gender-\nexpansive children. One example of her public advocacy adversely affecting her professional \nwork is when Suzanne was declined for a teaching job at a Catholic university: \nIn this arena we protect and insulate our transgender child. I did this very public work of \ninsulating my child and there are places where I cannot get jobs. I applied to a Catholic \nUniversity in [another country] that was looking for an educator and they didn't even \nwrite back to me. There's no way my publication record and what I study, there's no way \nthey would hire me. So there's always a cost and I’m happy to pay it, but its better I pay it \nthan my child pay it. \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 133 \n \n The themes that emerged from Suzanne’s data were highly connected and fit under three \nmajor categories: 1) Acts of advocacy, motivations for advocacy, and the role of sociopolitical \ncontext, 2) development as an advocate, and 3) consequences and costs: “The other side of \nadvocacy”. Each theme included discussion of the influence of sociopolitical factors, such as the \nTrump presidency in the U.S. and hate speech excused as “freedom of speech” or religion. In her \ninterview, Suzanne not only described examples of her specific acts of advocacy, but also spoke \nto the societal and historical context surrounding these efforts. The advocacy artifacts \nrecommended by Suzanne, which consist primarily of resources for transgender/gender-\nexpansive youth and their advocates, also reflect Suzanne’s systems-level thinking. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n When asked during the interview what advocacy artifacts she would recommend, \nSuzanne readily listed a number of educational resources. Suzanne seemed to define advocacy \nartifacts as those educational resources that would be helpful to anyone looking to learn how to \nbetter support the transgender/gender-expansive community. In addition to providing specific \nresources, Suzanne made the following statement: \nBasically, any organization that is fighting on the left is going to have a statement about \ntransgender rights and have helpful policy documents. If you look at progressive \ndemocratic senators and congress people, they usually have a Trans or gay and lesbian \nadvocacy wing as well. \n Table 9 outlines the advocacy artifacts recommended by Suzanne, to include the title, \ntype, her description of the artifact, and a summary description of the item from the source. \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 134 \n \nTable 9 \nRecommended Advocacy Artifacts – Suzanne \nArtifact Title  \n \nArtifact Type Participant Description Summary Description from Source  \nLambda Legal Organization \nwith list of \nonline resources \n“lambda legal has tremendous \nresources for things you can do” \n“Lambda Legal, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is a \nnational organization committed to achieving full \nrecognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, \nbisexuals, transgender people and everyone living \nwith HIV through impact litigation, education and \npublic policy work” (Lambda Legal, 2019). \nOn-line Facebook \ngroups for parents of \ntransgender and \ngender-expansive youth \n(ex/ Parents of \nTransgender Children \nclosed group) \nOn-line social \nmedia support \ngroup \nNone provided. “This group is comprised of parents and parenting \nfigures, as well as a select group of advocates \nINVITED by the admin staff to assist & help us \nwith understanding legal and other concerns.

She was born in the early 1980s into highly religious family, and survived conversion \ntherapy facilitated by a faith leader from the church her family attended. Upon graduating high \nschool, Amanda entered the military and served from 2000 to 2006. After her discharge from the \nmilitary, Amanda attended a “very, very, very liberal arts college in [another state] that helped \nradicalize me a little bit in my politics”. She completed her Bachelor’s and masters degrees at \nthis university before returning home to New Mexico. \n After returning to New Mexico, Amanda was hired as the executive director of a large \nnon-profit whose primary aim was enhancing the wellbeing of the LGBTQ community. Amanda \nstated that she: \nLiked the idea of being able to come back home and fight for a community that I was \nnow deeply a part of yet hadn't had the opportunity to really be a part of at home because \nI left home at 17 and was still not really out in my community at that time. \n She describes reconciling with her family after returning to NM, stating that her family \n“came around”, with her father even testifying publicly about the harmful effects of conversion \ntherapy and supporting a statewide ban of the practice. \n Amanda now describes herself as a “recovering executive director”, as she discontinued \nher leadership activities in the non-profit industry and is now completing a project as part of a \nfellowship. Amanda is also assisting a non-profit entity with fundraising and event organizing \nand assisting with a democratic candidate’s campaign. She describes her current income as \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 139 \n \nbetween $50,000 and $74,999, and states that leaving the non-profit sector for her current work \nresulted in a significant increase in income. \n Amanda and I initially met when myself and my partner participated in activities to \nsupport the statewide ban on conversion therapy, and to allow transgender and gender-expansive \nindividuals to change their gender marker on their birth certificates.. A little over a year later, \nwhen I began recruiting participants for this study, one of my participants recommended I \ncontact Amanda for participation. Amanda recognized my name and seemed excited about the \nprospect of participating in this study. \nInterview Context \n After communicating back and forth via email, Amanda and I determined that a coffee \nshop near the university campus was most convenient for both of us to meet. We met during the \nmid-morning hours on a weekday, when the coffee shop was almost empty. Although the coffee \nshop was small, the healthy distance between tables fostered a sense of privacy. Amanda did not \nat any time speak in hushed tones and stated that she felt the location was adequately private. \nThe interview lasted a total of 84 minutes, approximately half an hour over the one hour initially \nscheduled. Much like the other participants whose interview time exceeded the one hour time \nframe, Amanda shared her own coming out story and how her identity as LGBTQ impacted her \ndevelopment as an advocate. \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n During the interview, Amanda provided rich descriptions of her experience, carefully \nweaving together explanations of her process as an advocate and specific examples of her \nadvocacy efforts. She also attended to systems-level work, an area of advocacy that most other \nparticipants reported less experience with. Amanda’s experience with policy work and large-\nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 140 \n \nscale community organizing lead to the generation of many themes that were unique to her data. \nAlthough the categories that emerged from Amanda’s data were similar to those of other \nparticipants, the themes seemed distinct, thus her case portrait contains a more extensive write \nup. \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nPersonal Journey: Coming Out & Surviving Conversion Therapy \n Amanda’s personal story of coming out as Lesbian and being forced to participate in \nconversion therapy during adolescence significantly impacted her career choices, and future \ndevelopment as an advocate. She describes leaving her home in New Mexico to serve in the \nmilitary at age 17 with “things not resolved with my family” and staying “away for almost 15 \nyears” before returning home. During those 15 years, Amanda says that she attended a liberal \narts university and obtained her bachelors and masters degrees and was inspired to participate in \nsocial justice work. \n When Amanda elected to return to New Mexico, she stated that she wanted to invest in \nthe LGBTQ community, so she accepted a job working as a leader in the non-profit industry. She \ndescribes realizing now that she entered the field of advocacy work and social justice because: \nIt was an opportunity to do things differently, to be vindicated in a way. None of us get \ninto this work because it's fun or because it sounds interesting. We get into the work \nbecause we're somewhat touched by it, broken by it, and need to heal in some way, shape \nor form. And that was certainly a part of it for me. \n Amanda emphasizes the role of her advocacy work in healing from family rejection, and \nher highly traumatic experience with conversion therapy. When Amanda began engaging in \nadvocacy work surrounding the banning of conversion therapy, she describes being \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 141 \n \n“retraumatized” and that “it just wiped me out emotionally…wiped me out emotionally”. Despite \nthe emotionally taxing nature of social justice work, Amanda describes her identity as an activist \nand advocate as part of her core identity. \nIdentity as an Advocate \n Since she was a child, Amanda has believed in the importance of justice and equality. \nGrowing up, she says that even her family noticed her interest in social justice. Amanda \ndescribes her family as seeing her desire to help others, but failing to provide an environment \nwhere she could further explore this aspect of her identity: \nWhen my parents talk about me as a kid, I was always very concerned with justice and \nfairness. I always kind of had that spot for people where I just was always concerned with \nthings being fair and seeing things that were wrong in the world. But I didn't know how \nto put it together then, and I certainly wasn't in an environment where that was nourished. \n As an adult, Amanda has pursued her passion for social justice through advocacy work in \nthe non-profit industry. She describes loving her work facilitating fundraisers, promoting the \norganization through digital communications and advertising, and assisting with providing \nclients with direct services: \nI like what I’m doing now. I really love the [non-profit setting]. I believe in the services \nthat they provide people. It's more tangible, as I see the people that they help every single \nday. \n Throughout her interview, Amanda describes herself as focused on helping the LGBTQ \ncommunity by organizing events and members of the public in support of causes important to the \nLGBTQ community. Amanda seems to view advocacy and activism as a calling in life, rather \nthan just a job, and views herself as a helper, elevating the voices of the LGBTQ community \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 142 \n \nthrough her efforts. In the following quote, Amanda describes how negative changes (which she \nlater references in the interview as related to the current conservative political climate) as like \n“drinking from a fire hose”: \nWe're kind of drinking from a fire hose right now. There have been people - myself \nincluded – that have had to check out from time to time. It's just been too much. Every \nsingle day there's something new, something terrible. There's some new terrible thing \nhappening. I’m an activist, and I know there are a lot of people feeling this way, so it’s \nimportant to show people the tangible things they can do about it. \n Amanda defines her advocacy efforts as not only helping the LGBTQ community, but \nalso helping members of the public who wish to support a cause or feel that they are contributing \nto change. She describes herself as showing people “the tangible things they can do” about a \nproblem or to address an issue. Advocacy is not only taking action to pursue change, it also \nhelping others find ways to contribute to positive change. \nActs of Advocacy \nThe Role of Trauma in Advocacy: “Connecting the Dots” \n While completing the coursework for her masters degree, Amanda was “really fascinated \nwith adverse childhood experiences”. She says that this interest inspired her to consider the \neffects of the highly traumatic experience of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. Amanda \ndescribes “connecting the dots” between the trauma of conversion therapy, and negative \noutcomes in adulthood. Amanda states that her leadership role in the non-profit industry enabled \nher to support banning the practice of conversion therapy. She states that advocating for this ban \nis “all about the young people” and “preventing trauma and trying to set young people up for \npositive outcomes in their adulthood”. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 143 \n \n Amanda articulates her belief that banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ youth \n(defined as under age 18) will, for some of them, reduce the adverse events they experience. \nAccording to Amanda: \nWe're not going to prevent all trauma. The more we can, the less trauma in young \npeople's lives, the better the chance of better outcomes in adulthood. We know what \ntrauma can do. That was another interesting thing that I started to connect some dots on. \nWhen I really started diving into the conversion therapy campaign, I thought you've got \nto start connecting the dots on adverse childhood experiences. Then I was able to start \nhaving conversations with legislators about this, showing them that conversion therapy is \na traumatic experience and that we're talking about an adverse childhood experience. You \nhave to start connecting these dots. We can actually stop this form of trauma, or at least \ntry. \n In the aforementioned quote, Amanda describes not only “connecting the dots” between \nthe adverse experience of conversion therapy and negative outcomes in adulthood for LGBTQ \npersons, but also her recognition that she needed to help members of the community connect \nthese dots. She says that in order for her to affect social change, she needed to ensure that the \ncommunity understood that the conversion therapy ban would help reduce and even prevent one \nform of trauma currently impacting our youth. \n While the potential for prevention of trauma plays a role in political strategy, the actual \nexperience of trauma by persons involved in advocacy efforts requires the leaders involved to \nconsider the needs of trauma survivors. Amanda explains that the majority of conversion therapy \nis practiced by persons within faith communities and in church settings, and that many of the \npersons involved in supporting the conversion therapy ban had highly traumatic experiences that \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 144 \n \noccurred in the church environment. She says that the community organizers she worked with \nduring the conversion therapy ban campaign scheduled meetings at churches because the spaces \nwere usually free. Amanda describes having to challenge these organizers to find “neutral” \nspaces for meetings in order to honor the experience of community members who had \nexperienced trauma in the church setting: \nThere's some assumption that these faith communities are safe. While some are great and \nwonderful, accepting, open and affirming, and I appreciate them more than anything, that \ndoesn't mean that people necessarily want to go into a church building. No matter how \nsafe and affirming it is. Yet we constantly organize meetings in these spaces. People \nusually like to point back to the civil rights movement and they say, “well the civil rights \nmovement was organized in churches”, but it’s important that they know that that was out \nof necessity; that they weren't allowed to be other places. Now we have meeting halls and \nrooms all over our communities that are neutral. \nEmploying Professional Skills in Advocacy & Community Work \nUsing Testimony as an Intervention. Amanda describes several specific methods she employed \nto help the community understand the traumatic effects of conversion therapy. During events, \nshe informed the community that professional counseling and psychology organizations had \ndeemed the practice of conversion therapy unethical, and stated that many states had already \nbanned it. Amanda also encouraged a number of youth survivors of conversion therapy to share \ntheir stories publicly. In the following quote, Amanda describes how the testimony of these \nyouth affected the audience:  \nWe had youth participation through the roof during our [events], and I'll tell you those \nyoung people testifying was just incredible. It was just amazing and they left [community \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 145 \n \nmembers] in tears because they're talking about just wanting to be able to be themselves, \nand talking about their experiences. There’s nothing more powerful than when you hear it \nfrom a young person. It was just amazing. \n Amanda states that her own personal story of surviving conversion therapy “was at the \ncenter” of the activities she participated in regarding the conversion therapy ban. It seems that \nAmanda’s experience with conversion therapy, and she and her father’s testimony about the \nadverse effects of the practice contributed to Amanda’s credibility as an advocate. During the \ninterview, Amanda shared about her experience coming out to her parents and surviving \nconversion therapy stating that “[when] I went through it at my church, I went between two \npeople. One was a pastoral care counselor and the other was a psychotherapist”. Listening to \nAmanda share about this trauma during the interview, I found myself brought to tears. The \ntrauma Amanda experienced, and her passion for ensuring that others are spared this experience, \nwas both inspiring and painfully sad. \n Amanda states that as an adult she eventually made peace with her father. Her father now \nsupports her advocacy work, and even assisted her with some advocacy efforts. It seems that \nAmanda’s father’s status as a public figure within the community, and previous support of \nconversion therapy, meant that his testimony had a greater impact on the audience/legislators: \nMy Dad was at the center of the conversion therapy [ban activities] too, because my dad \ndecided to come forward to provide testimony. According to the National Center for \nLesbian Rights it's very rare to get a parent who made the decision to put their kid in \nconversion therapy to then come forward and say I was wrong, but my dad was willing to \ndo that, and my dad's a pretty big public figure too. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 146 \n \n From employing the voices of young LGBTQ people, to sharing her and her father’s \nexperience with conversion therapy, Amanda’s use of testimony is one example of her use of \nstrategy and skill in advocating for change. In addition to her abilities in planning and \norganization, Amanda has also utilized her knowledge of technology to advocate for the LGBTQ \ncommunity. \nUse of Technology in Advocacy Efforts \n As a technologically savvy individual with extensive experience managing in the non-\nprofit industry, Amanda has knowledge of organization’s needs and the challenges they face in \nproviding services and advocating for their target population. Amanda utilized this knowledge \nalong with her technological skills to create a tool that enables non-profits to invest in \nadvertising and web-based communications that are within their budget. This act of advocacy \nserves as an example of how advocates utilize their skills to pursue positive change. Amanda \ndescribes the application of her professional knowledge of technology to contribute to change \nefforts in the following quote: \nI built a tool that allows small nonprofits to go to a website that they can enter their \nbudget, their staff levels, their digital communications goals, everything from building a \nbetter email program to what social media sites do. It helps non-profits determine what \nthey actually need to be messing with, and what they need to ignore. It also shows them \nhow to do digital advertising and to how to build a mobile friendly website. With this \ntool, they can get a blueprint of where to start with the different kinds of tools available \nthat are either no cost or low cost and require no tech skills to actually use, so that it's \nmanageable within their budget and staffing levels, and they don't actually need to hire a \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 147 \n \nconsultant or have a communications person. I created this because I want nonprofits to \nbe self-sufficient. \nPursuing Systems-level Change \n Much of Amanda’s advocacy work centered around generating systemic change. While \nworking within the non-profit industry, Amanda maintained a political focus, aiming to change \npolicies that oppress LGBTQ communities and generate new policies to ensure equity. In order \nto achieve this goal, Amanda spear headed several programs/advocacy efforts at any given time. \nWhile promoting the conversion therapy ban, Amanda also brought together a multitude of \norganizations for a “bullying prevention program”: \nWe built a statewide bullying prevention program where we had state and local \ngovernment agencies and foundations from around the state, and community \norganizations, parents, and students all at the table. It was a really powerful program.  \n Amanda describes this initiative as impacting more than just LGBTQ youth in the school \nenvironment, as bullying is not “organically arising from young people” but is instead “an adult \nproblem”. Conceptualizing bullying as arising from young people’s home environments and \ninteractions with adults ensures that the interventions aimed at preventing bullying address the \nsystemic factors contributing to the problem. Per Amanda: \nBullying Prevention isn't just about what's happening in the schools. With young people, \nit’s more than just their stuff that's coming into these environments. Actually, it's not \norganically arising from young people. This is an adult problem, so the work we need to \nbe doing is outside of the school to help create conditions for what is being brought into \nthe schools by young people.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 148 \n \n The bullying prevention program included adult trainings outside of the school \nenvironment that emphasized awareness of personal bias, and ways to prevent violence. These \ntrainings focused on the ill effects of bullying and violence on youth (particularly LGBTQ \nyouth), with Amanda describing bullying as putting these youth on a “negative path”: \nWe did some amazing work through the [bullying prevention program] that included \ntraining outside of the schools that was focused on adults. It included bias training and \nviolence prevention, all within this frame of how these adverse experiences put young \npeople on a negative path. \n Including adults from across the state from a variety of organizations and settings ensures \nthat the information is disseminated widely, and most likely to affect systems level change. In \naddition to addressing bias and violence prevention, Amanda also described organizing \ninitiatives for groups within the LGBTQ community who have historically been forgotten, such \nas LGBTQ persons with disabilities. She indicated that all of these initiatives are in addition to \nher organization’s “bread and butter work” of ensuring that the needs of the LGBTQ community \nare attended to: \nWe had a number of other initiatives too. We built a disability community advocacy \nprogram where we looked for ways to reach populations that haven't typically been at the \ntable in terms of LGBTQ organizing and LGBTQ work. This was in conjunction with \nmaking sure that we still did kind of our bread and butter work, which was the policies  \nwe need to get passed at the state level to keep creating really great conditions for \nLGBTQ New Mexicans. \nSociopolitical Context \nIn-group Politics within LGBTQ Advocacy Organizations \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 149 \n \n Sociopolitical context affects the efforts of advocates in a variety of ways. Advocacy is \naffected by the sociopolitical context in which efforts occur, such as public perception or the \npolicies created by persons in power. It is also influenced by politics within the field of \nadvocacy, and the LGBTQ community. One example of the influence of this form of ingroup-\npolitics is Amber’s discussion of the need for leaders within the LGBTQ community who are \n“people of color” or who “have disabilities”. She states that leaders from minority backgrounds \nare needed to ensure that the needs of all members of the community are represented and all \nvoices are heard: \nWe've never been just one thing. Even though we are led by people who identify as \nLGBTQ, we also need to be led by people who identify as people of color, who identify \nas having disabilities. We need to be led by people who have a number of different \nidentifiers in their lives, that that played a part in who they were culturally and politically. \nIt was really important to us that even though we were in LGBTQ advocacy organization \nthat all of those things are able to be a part of our work in one way or another. \n Amanda states that although advocacy organizations must attempt to ensure all voices are \nheard, it is also difficult to control this process. She says that it is a messy process and impossible \nto say, without a doubt, that an organization effectively elevates the voices of ALL members of \nthe LGBTQ community: \nIt's messy. It's really messy and regarding people being heard - you can't always control \nwhether people feel heard, and it's not really something that you can bestow on people \neither. You can create the conditions for it, but after that it's kind of out of your hands. \n Amanda describes collaborative efforts as also “messy” and challenging. She reports \nexperiencing difficulty when trying to ensure that the viewpoints of everyone involved in a given \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 150 \n \ncollaborative advocacy effort are honored. Amanda attributes this difficulty to the fact that all \ncommunity members bring their own “baggage” and “set of circumstances” to the table. She says \nthat the idea that LGBTQ persons are part of a “monolithic community” is false, as there are \ninnumerable “absolute differences” among members related to their experiences and identifiers: \nCollaboration is tough because we're all bringing our own set of circumstances, our own \nbaggage, and our own viewpoints to the table. I think this idea that we're a community is \njust a complete falsity. The LGBTQ community is not a monolithic community where \nwe're all the same. Until we can get used to the idea of absolute difference, we're really \nprobably not going to get very far. We want to feel connected to each other because we \nneed that. We crave that, but that doesn't mean we're the same. \n Amanda acknowledges that the belief in one united LGBTQ community is essential as it \nallows members to feel a sense of connection, but also problematic in that it leads people outside \nof the community to make assumptions about what all LGBTQ identifying individuals believe. \nAmanda argues that this conceptualization of LGBTQ persons all belonging to one community \nalso acts as a barrier to the organizing of advocacy efforts. She says that viewing LGBTQ \npersons in this way leads political organizers and politicians to believe that identifying as \nLGBTQ means that the individual “should fall in line this way” politically, and should “vote this \nway”: \nWe assign these things in our community, “well you’re this, so then this”, and it’s not \ntrue. When you’re doing [organizing for advocacy efforts], it makes it really challenging. \nPeople say, “we’re an LGBTQ community, so therefore you should fall in line this way” \nor “therefor you should think this way or vote this way”, and that’s not necessarily the \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 151 \n \ncase. It creates a lot of challenges, and challenges how organizing should happen and \nhow we should be involved. We all make a lot of assumptions. \nCommunity-based Advocacy: “Uplifting what is already there” \n During the interview, Amanda seemed to define “community” differently based on \ncontext. For instance, “LGBTQ community” in the context of organizing advocacy efforts or \ncollaboration references a monolithic community about whom a number of automatic \nassumptions are made. When referencing community-based advocacy, Amanda describes \ncommunities as the existing social groups with their own “centers of power” and unique culture \nand norms. She describes these communities as spread throughout New Mexico, with members \nhaving a variety of identifiers (e.g. LGBTQ, disabled, of a specific ethnicity). Amanda states that \nthese communities are often doing their own advocacy work, aiming to build power within their \ncommunity, and that it is the task of the advocate/advocacy organization to “uplift what is \nalready happening”: \nWe need to do our due diligence and see what amazing things are already happening \nbecause it's there, when you're looking at building power in a community, it's not like \ncoming in and saying we have this new shiny thing. It's how do we uplift what is already \nhappening. \n When entering a community in order to engage in some advocacy project or effort, it is \nessential that existing members of the community facilitate the effort. Amanda states that it is the \nmembers of the community that best know the needs and interests of that community, and that \nusing these individuals – rather than “transplanting” strangers – honors their identity and history: \nAnother part is, you're not transplanting people in a community. You're saying the people \nwho need to be here, need to be people who are from the community and who know the \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 152 \n \ncommunity. It shows that we are trusting that they know what's best, and we are just \ngiving them the resources that they need to thrive.  \n Amanda provides an example of this approach to advocacy work when she describes the \ndisability community program her non-profit helped build: \nIt's how we built [a] disability community program. We built something, we brought \nsomebody on who had been doing disability community work for years there and had \nnever been a part of an organization before. They had been doing it on their own for \nyears. We said, “do you want to come and just do whatever you want here with us?” And \nthey did, and it was awesome. \nAdvocating for Systemic Change vs. “changing hearts and minds work”   \n During her interview, Amanda made a powerful statement about the purpose of the \ndifferent types of advocacy work in which she engages. She describes her work as creating the \n“conditions” necessary for young LGBTQ people to live as their authentic selves and have their \nrights protected. Amanda distinguishes programmatic work from her community-based efforts, \nstating that it is the community organizing involved in initiatives such as the antibullying \nprogram that facilitate “changing hearts and minds”. According to Amanda, both forms of \nadvocacy are necessary for positive change: \nBoth the conversion therapy ban and [ability to change birth certificates] - they're very \nmuch focused on young people, and about creating conditions for young people to have \nthe most support possible in their lives. I think that’s what a lot of the work that we tried \nto do [in the non-profit industry] and the [programmatic] work is all about. The \n[programmatic] work doesn't change hearts and minds. It just doesn't, but it helps create \nconditions in which your rights can be defended and it creates the conditions for systems \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 153 \n \nto create a pathway for people to have their rights and dignity realized. That's why we do \nthe [anti-bullying] initiative. That's why we do the immigrant advocacy work. That's the \nchanging hearts and minds work and you can't really have one without the other. \nMarriage equality didn't end homophobia. \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Amanda’s extensive experience with non-profit work, and her personal experience as a \nsurvivor of conversion therapy, provided data that was rich with information and broad in scope. \nThe largest category that emerged from the data was “acts of advocacy”, which contained two \nmajor themes (“role of trauma” and “employing professional skills”) and three subthemes \n(“using testimony”, “using technology”, and “pursuing systems-level change”). The second most \nprevalent category was “sociopolitical context” which contained three themes: “ingroup \npolitics”, “community-based advocacy”, and “policy work v. changing hearts and minds”. The \nfinal category that emerged from the data was Amanda’s “personal and professional \ndevelopment as an advocate”, which included themes about Amanda’s “personal journey” of \ncoming out and surviving conversion therapy, and her “identity as an advocate”. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n Amanda seemed to define advocacy artifacts as those organizations who most contribute \nto advocacy efforts for transgender and gender-expansive individuals, and members of the \nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Queer communities. Throughout the interview, Amanda described \nseveral organizations that have been involved in advocacy efforts for the transgender and gender-\nexpansive community in New Mexico. Table 10 outlines the advocacy artifacts recommended by \nAmanda, to include the title, type, and a summary description of item from the source. Amanda’s \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 154 \n \nverbatim description of each artifact is not included in this case portrait as Amanda listed her \nrecommendations verbally and did not provide descriptions. \n  \nHank \nTable 10 \nAdvocacy Artifacts - Amanda \nArtifact Title  Artifact Type Summary Description from Source  \nNew Mexico Religious \nCoalition for \nReproductive Choice \nAdvocacy \norganization \nSee https://nmrcrc.org/we-believe for more \ninformation.

Born in the early \n1970s in the southern U.S., Hank describes identifying as a “butch lesbian” for years prior to \nlearning about transgender identity and recognizing that this gender identity aligned with his \nexperience. He reports maintaining a strong relationship and respect for his mother who was \n“always accessible and someone I can talk to” and describes emulating her \nopenness “since I was young”.\n Hank has a bachelors in education, and describes his degree as helping develop his skills \nas a public speaker, and abilities as an educator/trainer. Hank also describes his experience as a \nbutch lesbian as being particularly impactful, stating that he learned how to “steer interactions” \nto help people “go over the hump of my gender variance”. He shared that during that time of his \nlife, when interacting with people (particularly potential employers) he had to “not let them get \nbogged down here…I’m gonna make [them] see me as a person, and somehow help [them] skim \npast the thing that some people get hung up on”.  \n These skills remain particularly pertinent today, as Hank utilizes his abilities as an \neducator and ability to relate to others to advocate for the transgender and gender-expansive \ncommunity. Hank currently resides in New Mexico and is an active member of the LGBTQ \ncommunity. His work in the non-profit industry provides a yearly income between $50,000 to \n$74,999.  \n I first met Hank in October of 2012, when he presented on gender identity during a \ntraining I attended. This presentation was my first introduction to transgender and gender-\nexpansive identities, and the struggles individuals in this community face due to social and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 156 \n \npolitical oppression. Four years later, when my 8 year old daughter asked to socially transition \nfrom presenting as male to presenting as female, I contacted Hank to ask for guidance. Hank \nprovided my family with education about the needs of transgender/gender-expansive youth and \nour child’s rights within the school environment. He also connected us to a community of \naffirming families and caregivers of transgender/gender-expansive youth. When I began \nrecruiting participants for this study, Hank was the first person I contacted to inquire about his  \npossibly participating in the project. He not only volunteered to participate, but also \nrecommended several other advocates who might be willing to contribute their perspectives. \nInterview Context \n After agreeing to participate in the study, Hank graciously offered for us to use his living \nroom at home to complete the interview. When I arrived for the interview (around 4 o’clock in \nthe afternoon), Hank introduced me to his partner, child, and dogs. Hank appeared very \ncomfortable in the space and seemed willing to experience vulnerability during the interview, as \nhe discussed personal experiences related to his own coming out and journey as a transgender \nman. The interview lasted a total of 58 minutes, with Hank indicating several resources for \nimproved understanding of how to advocate for and better understand the experience of \ntransgender and gender-expansive persons.  \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Hank’s experience working in a non-profit agency serving the transgender and gender-\nexpansive community has afforded him the opportunity to advocate in a variety of spaces, at both \nthe macro or systems-level and the micro/individual level. Reflecting on these experiences, Hank \ndescribes patterns of behavior among teachers, parents, and practitioners in health and mental \nhealthcare who are entrusted with the care of transgender and gender-expansive youth. Over the \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 157 \n \ncourse of the interview, Hank also made multiple connections between current experiences and \nhistorical events. This participant’s ability to attend to his own experience while also noting the \nconnection between his experience and the wider societal context lead to the emergence of many \ninterconnected themes. The diversity of Hank’s experience is reflected in the themes outlined \nbelow. \nConnection Between Individual Advocacy Efforts & Macro-Level Variables \nNon-Profit Industrial Complex \n One example of Hank’s attention to the macro-level context of his advocacy efforts was \nhis description of the “non-profit industrial complex”. Hank described the non-profit industrial \ncomplex as referring to the role non-profit agencies play in perpetuating the social problems they \naim to alleviate or reduce: \nThere is an argument to be made about non-profits perpetuating problems by trying in \nvain to address those societal problems that need to be addressed at a much larger \nstructural level. If we were really a “good society” we wouldn’t allow people to not be \nhoused. Why should we at [a non-profit entity] be trying in vain to do the little bit we can \ndo to help folks who aren’t housed, instead of America saying “We won’t stand for \npeople living like this. We won’t let people in our culture live this way. If you are in our \ncountry you get these basic needs met”.  \nNon-profits have exploded since the 70s. There’s been this huge proliferation of non-\nprofits trying to do these little things, and each trying to struggle for the same funding as \nthe others. They keep us locked in this sort of hamster wheel of making sure our writing \nis good, and that we’re getting grants, instead of saying, “What would get to the bottom \nof this? Is it poverty? Then let’s all address poverty”. But we don’t do that. We are like “I \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 158 \n \nsave the pandas” and “I save the trans people” and “I’m queer legislative advocacy”, it’s \nall “non-profit, non-profit, non-profit, non-profit”. \n In the preceding quote, Hank situates his efforts working in the non-profit industry \nserving transgender and gender-expansive individuals as only contributing to the problem by \nfailing to hold society accountable. Hank calls upon greater society to deem social problems such \nas homelessness unacceptable, and to act to address this problem. He describes non-profits as \nonly treating the “symptoms” and failing to address the causes: \nWe really don’t have our eye on the ball with what we need to deal with to change our \nworld, to change our culture. Even if we just think about the U.S., what would change the \nU.S? We are not looking at causes, we are looking at symptoms, and we don’t even \nrealize we are looking at the symptoms and not looking at the cause…even if we could \nsolve the symptoms, we couldn’t solve the sickness. \n Hank further elaborates on the ill effects non-profits have on the social issues they aim to \nalleviate when discussing the impact of asking for donations. He states that by providing \nmembers of society the option to donate to a cause, they are able to feel that they have helped, \neven though they have not actually contributed to an effort that will change the problem. \nEnabling people to feel that they are contributing through their donations is also problematic \nbecause it allows the individual to avoid seeing the ugly face of poverty, oppression, \ndiscrimination – the “sickness” causing our current social problems: \nThe existence of non-profits really keeps people from looking at the problem. People can \ngive money to [our non-profit], and they never have to see the transgender women [who \nreceive services]; they never have to encounter them. We keep this person from ever \nhaving to really see what’s going on in the city that they live in. People going hungry, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 159 \n \nselling their body for food or drugs…right down the street. But you don’t really have to \nlook at that person, or think about their existence, because you give us money to take care \nof them. We just use that money to take care of them, and what does that mean? \n“Respectability Politics” \n Hank states that his outreach and education efforts often indirectly reinforce the gender \nbinary. He explains that the standard of practice provided by the American Academy of \nPediatrics regarding gender identity development continues to frame children as knowing their \ngender is “male or female” by age 4. This standard of practice does not provide a frame of \nreference for the gender identity development of non-binary or gender-expansive children. Hank \nstates that this lack of information, coupled with the social expectation that transgender \nindividuals only traverse from one end of the binary to the other, forces him to temper his \nmessage during education sessions. \n One example of ‘tempering the message’ is Hank’s decision to utilize those panelists \nduring a presentation about gender identity who would appeal to the “movable middle” (defined \nas those individuals who seem open to the possibility of changing their perspective on a given \nissue). Hank describes having one panelist who presented as bi-gender, with secondary sex \ncharacteristics of both male and female genders. Hank chose not to include this individual as a \npanelist for a school education session. He states that he did not include the bi-gender panelist \nbecause he sought to speak to the “movable middle” within the school and was afraid that \nincluding the perspective of someone who is too far outside of the male/female gender binary \nmight cause some open minds to close. Regarding this education session at a local school, Hank \nstates: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 160 \n \nI’m kind of pushing the non-binary people to the back of the bus, even though I don’t \nmean to do that, and don’t want to do it. I think the question that all of us have to ask – no \nmatter who we are advocating for – how much is it worth it to sell it to the middle? What \nthey call the “movable middle”. Is it at any cost? What if we push peoples’ voices to the \nmargins even further because we’ve got to reach these middle people? Versus if it doesn’t \ninclude everybody, it’s not worth it. That’s another tight rope I think we walk, the tight \nrope of respectability politics. How far am I willing to push with panel members? Is it \nmore important for an individual trans person to have a voice and tell their story, or is it \nmore important that the whole room of people gets moved a little, if we can? \nAdult Treatment of Transgender and Gender-Expansive Children \n Hank also describes the treatment of transgender children by adults as rooted in society’s \n“adultist” attitude. He describes society as viewing children as “cute little idiots” and refusing to \nacknowledge children’s awareness of their own identities, to include gender identity. One \nexample provided by Hank is how adults will say to children that they “don’t know” their gender \nidentity and will “feel different” when they are “older”:  \nIt is just another intersection of oppression. We are a super adultist society, and we do \nthings as though kids were like cute little idiots that have no self-awareness, and no \nidentity-integrity. I think we do that around lots of stuff, trans is just an example. Many \ntimes I hear people say to kids, “you don’t know, you’ll feel different when you are \nolder”. And some things they will grow up to feel different, but what does that say to say \nthat to them? To invalidate them all of the time like that? \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 161 \n \n Hank further describes this adultist attitude when discussing the reaction of some adults \nto children who wish to present as a gender other than that assigned at birth. Specifically, Hank \ndescribes how transgender females had to “bargain” to wear barrettes and headbands: \nThey used to bargain back in the day about barrettes, and headbands and things. Like \n“she could wear the headbands if she doesn’t cry”, when she was only crying because she \nwas getting bullied. You wouldn’t tell a girl “you can only wear barrettes if ‘some \nrequirement’”. You wouldn’t think you had the right to actually have control over her \nbarrettes. This girl you do, but that girl you don’t. When I back up from it, I think how \nmuch of this is across society.  \nDevelopment as an Advocate \n“It didn’t have to be perfect, it just had to ‘be’” - Hank \nComing Out & Experiencing Transition \n Hank describes his own coming out journey as intertwined with his decision to advocate \nfor the transgender/gender-expansive community. He describes his coming out process as one of \nself-discovery, impeded by numerous challenges, and a lack of information and resources. It was \nduring this experience that he was inspired to help other people who confront the same barriers \nand challenges during their coming out and/or gender transition. While explaining his coming \nout journey, Hank states that he identified as a “butch lesbian” during his young adulthood, until \nhe was introduced to transgender identity through the text Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg \n(1993):  \nI didn’t know that I knew any trans people, and I didn’t have the internet, so I was on this \nhistorical cusp when I was coming out. When Stone Butch Blues was published in the \nmid 90s, I read it and that’s when I thought, “oh my god, that’s what I am – that’s me, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 162 \n \nnow I get it”. It took me 8 more years after that to take the first medical steps; it was still \nso scary, so unknown. \n After identifying his experience in this way, Hank encountered a number a myths and \nmisconceptions about medical interventions for the transition process. These misguided beliefs \nleft him fearful of pursuing a medical gender transition, despite his desire to align his physical \npresentation with his inner experience: \nI always get embarrassed to talk about it, because I sound so ignorant. At the time, even \nin the early 2000s, building up to my medical transition I knew I wanted it, but I was so \nscared to do anything or move it forward at all. Some of the information that was coming \nout, slow trickles of information, like documentaries, we saw stories of guys who had \nbeen lesbians, and then they went on T [Testosterone], and then they started to date guys, \nand they were gay. So even though now it sounds really dumb, I could not figure out if \nthere was some kind of a correlation between taking T and having your sexual orientation \nshift like that. In my mind, I was lesbian for a long time, so if I was gay I would be proud \nto be gay and be in the gay pride parade and everything. I had a partner, and we were just \nabout to have a baby, and he was coming, and I didn’t want to wake up gay and lose my \nfamily for T.  \n The process of exploring his options for a physical, medically assisted gender transition, \nand being confronted with fear-inducing misinformation left Hank wondering about the \nexperience of other transgender people. Hank states that he was particularly concerned about \nthose members of the transgender community who have multiple intersections of oppression, and \nwho – unlike him – have little to no privilege: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 163 \n \nI couldn’t find what I needed. It was dark and scary, and I was isolated. I went back into \npuberty, but I didn’t know that’s what I was going through; that was really dark, and \nscary, and isolating. I felt like there had to be other people, people who are getting lost. If \nthis is so hard for me – as a resourced and resilient person – what was happening for \nothers who were more fragile. What were they doing when they couldn’t figure it out. \nWas anyone doing anything to help them? Trans people? I looked, and there wasn’t. \nPrivilege \n Hank seemed to transform the trauma of transitioning with little information or support \ninto a source of inspiration to help others. He identified his experience as still one of privilege, \nstating: \nI had some awareness of it, but my awareness is now much more vivid. I’m aware that I \nam a privileged person. I am a person that has the expectation of being helped, being able \nto find the resources, and get in the car that I have, and go to the doctor, and have this \nstuff. \n Hank acknowledged that although his experience with medical transition was difficult, he \nwas still more resourced and privileged than many individuals in the transgender community. \nHank reached out to a close friend who was also a member of the transgender community to talk \nabout his experience, and desire to help others in the community. Through this friendship, Hank \nand his friend entered the non-profit industry with the goal of improving the wellbeing of the \ntransgender and gender-expansive community.  \nActs of Advocacy \nFounding a Non-Profit Entity  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 164 \n \n For Hank, the creation of a non-profit entity seemed to be the culmination of years of \nadvocacy work. Prior to establishing the entity, Hank was participating in and helping to \ncoordinate panels with other LGBTQ organizations. He states that engaging in public speaking \nregarding issues that affect the transgender community contributed to his decision to help \nestablish a non-profit entity: \nI was starting to do panels, and I was getting a lot of good responses. I started saying \n“Should we do this thing? And create this thing? The [non-profit entity]?”. And that was \nthe first obvious moment when we decided to start [it]. We started doing education out in \nthe community. That for me has felt like the biggest platform for my advocacy, because \nyou just don’t know who all you are talking to and what impact you are having. You \ndon’t get to hear about your impact, it’s just sowing all of these seeds. And I always \nreally liked working with people one on one too, I’m lucky that I get to do both. So for \nme it was a clear avenue for me as an advocate, to try to take it out to the cis-public. \n Hank describes providing outreach and education to the “cis-public” (cisgender public) as \na means of “sowing seeds” of understanding. In this quote, Hank is referencing experiences \nwhere individuals who have attended his presentations have become allies or advocates for the \ntransgender community. I believe that Hank may have also been referencing his own experience \nwith me, a cisgender heterosexual parent of a transgender child. At the beginning of our \ninterview, I mentioned to Hank that I reached out to him and to the agency about my daughter \nbecause I had attended one of his presentations years ago. I had attended the training when she \nwas just a baby, and when she was old enough to articulate her gender identity as transgender, I \nknew that his non-profit entity could provide me with more information and support to help me \nbetter meet my daughter’s needs. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 165 \n \n Developing the non-profit entity not only provided a home base for Hank’s education and \noutreach efforts, but also provided a hub for the provision of resources to community members. \nHank states that his decision to establish the entity required a bit of a leap of faith: \nFor us, it was just having the philosophy that “it didn’t need to be perfect, it just needed \nto be”. The space that we moved into first was so crappy, and not at all what worked for \nour needs. We decided “let’s just open”. Let’s just open and start figuring out more about \nit and then we can move. We don’t have to be stuck in this place, but let’s not wait until \nwe have the right place. \nEducation & Outreach \n As part of his work with the agency, Hank frequently attends conferences for a variety of \nprofessions, providing practitioners with presentations regarding diverse gender identities. \nAlthough Hank personalizes each training to the needs of the individuals in attendance, his \npresentations always cover: Introductory information about gender identity development, \ntransgender and gender-expansive identity and the gender spectrum, aspects of medical and \nsocial gender transition, and the standard of care for this population. Hank also includes a \nquestion and answer session at the end of each training where he informs the audience:  \nAsk me embarrassing questions, ask me stupid questions, ask the weird stuff you don’t \nwant to ask people, and let’s just talk about it, this is the time. This is when we can do it. \nAnd so I can’t be mad when they do! \n The act of providing practitioners and the “cis-public” with information about the \ndiversity of gender identity and fostering open conversation enables Hank to help people who are \nin the “movable middle” traverse to a position of acceptance. Hank describes his advocacy work \nproviding these trainings as helping people see the humanity in the transgender community, and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 166 \n \nthe importance of supporting transgender and gender-expansive youth to be their authentic \nselves.  \nGalvanizing Members of the Movable Middle \n In response to the interview question, “Please describe a particularly memorable instance \nwhere you were called upon, or where circumstances permitted you to advocate for a transgender \nor gender non-conforming child”, Hank described a presentation where a nurse practitioner (NP) \nlabeled medical interventions for gender transition for youth as “child abuse”. He stated that this \npractitioner approached the microphone during the question and answer portion of the training, \nand “was like a dog with a bone about it, it was really interesting”. Hank says that this NP’s \nstaunch rejection of medical interventions for transgender and gender-expansive youth \n“galvanized the rest of the room”: \nTo me, the most fascinating thing that day was that it galvanized the whole rest of the \nroom. And I didn’t have to rebut her, because another NP took the mic to say, more \nforcefully than what I would have said, “You are wrong, it is child abuse to hurt these \nkids...to let them kill themselves”. Then the other NP said “Yeah we just need to be \nworrying about adolescent suicide”, and I said “No, no no no. No. Noo.” You want your \nhead in the sand about this, but other people in the room knew well what we were talking \nabout which is that this is a life or death juncture for these kids. \n By allowing persons attending the training to share their perspectives, the audience is \nprovided the opportunity to hear from persons who would deny transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth support or access to gender transition related care. In Hank’s experience, it \nseems that many of those individuals who are willing to share their lack of support are not \nlooking to have their perspective changed. These individuals can be adamant about their disbelief \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 167 \n \nin transgender identity, or in Hank’s words “like a dog with a bone about it”. Thus sharing their \nperspective and having a dialogue with Hank and other audience members does not change their \nbeliefs, but it does impact those persons in the room who are in the “movable middle”. As \ndescribed in the quote above, audience members responded “forcefully” to the nurse’s statement \nabout medical treatment being a form of child abuse. Hank further describes this experience: \nThe fascinating thing was that even when I had a crappy encounter with this woman, I \nhad a more magical encounter with everybody else in the room. I wouldn’t be surprised \nto see a bunch of other ripples, like people wanting to volunteer and do things for the \ntransgender community. They got kind of passionate in that moment by her being \noppositional.  \n Hank describes the audience as a having a shocked, “passionate” response to the nurse’s \nopposition, such that they were motivated to speak out against her statement and her lack of \nsupport for transgender and gender-expansive youth. He believes that this experience may have \ncreated additional “ripples” of change, by motivating audience members to “volunteer and do \nthings” for the community. When advocating for this population, Hank’s experience speaks to an \nadvocate’s ability to facilitate open and honest dialogue among persons with a variety of \nperspectives, and his ability to cultivate growth and change through this process. \nWorking with Ambivalent & Rejecting Adults \nRejection as Protection \n As the founder of a non-profit entity, Hank often comes into contact with parents, \ncaregivers, and teachers who attempt to censor the gendered expression of the \ntransgender/gender-expansive child in their care. Hank describes these adults as attempting to \nhelp the child by preventing them from “being a target”. In their efforts to prevent the child from \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 168 \n \nbeing targeted by bullies, these adults may shame the child for choosing clothing that does not \nalign with the stereotypical dress of the sex assigned at birth. These adults believe themselves to \nbe helping the child and fail to see that their behavior communicates a message of rejection:  \nPeople are afraid for trans girls. There is their own fear that comes into it, their own \ngender stuff and fears. So they feel like they are trying to do you a good thing by not \nletting someone hurt them for being weird and being a target. You are trying to help me \nnot be a target, but instead you’re targeting me!  \nAdult’s Unresolved “Gender stuff” \n Many adults inadvertently communicate messages of rejection to transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth, when their intention is to protect these young people. Hank attributes this \n“rejection as protection” response to many adult’s “own gender stuff” and “conflicting stuff”. \n“Stuff” seems to be a reference to unresolved difficult experiences involving gender, such as an \nadult’s own childhood trauma with bullying by a parent or peer for some failure to conform to \nstereotypical gender expectations. He also notes how this perspective places the blame for \nbullying and harassment on the child victim, rather than on the bully. Hank further describes \n“rejection as protection” in the following quote: \nYou’re trying to be helpful, but you’re actually the one traumatizing me! You’re my \nteacher, even though I’m sure you’re probably feeling the most conflicting stuff on the \ninside, including “I’m afraid for this kid, and I don’t want them to be atypical”. That \nmentality in schools is hard. I can’t say how many times I’ve met teachers like that – like \n“if he wouldn’t dress like that then they wouldn’t do these things”. \nThe theme “rejection as protection” speaks to the role of gendered harassment in the \npolicing of gender norms, particularly in the school environment. While these adults may view \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 169 \n \ntheir actions as preventing bullying or harassment, their behavior in fact contributes to the \noverall aim of such harassment, the condemnation of non-conforming gender expression and \npressure to conform to “normative” gender practices (Meyer, 2009). \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n The primary categories “acts of advocacy” and “development as an advocate” contained a \nvariety of themes that were similar to those that emerged from other participant’s data. Themes \nwithin the category of “development as an advocate” included: Coming out and experiencing \ntransition, and awareness of privilege. The category “acts of advocacy” contained themes \nincluding: Founding a non-profit entity for the transgender/gender-expansive community, \neducation and outreach, and galvanizing members of the movable middle. \n Two major categories emerged from Hank’s data that were distinct from other \nparticipants, that of “working with ambivalent and rejecting adults: Rejection is protection” and \n“individual advocacy efforts and macro-level variables”. These two categories articulated how \nsocial mores and in-group politics shape advocacy efforts. Hank seemed to have unique insight \ninto these aspects of advocacy because of his own experience as a transgender man, and diversity \nof experience advocating for transgender and gender-expansive youth and adults in a variety of \nsettings. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n Hank appeared to define advocacy artifacts as those specific items that contributed to his \ndevelopment as an advocate, and journey as a transgender man. Table 11 outlines the advocacy \nartifacts recommended by Hank, to include the title, type, Hank’s description of the artifact, and \na summary description of the item from the source. \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 170 \n \nTable 11 \nRecommended Advocacy Artifacts – Hank \nArtifact Title  Artifact Type Participant Description Summary Description from Source  \nStone Butch Blues by \nLeslie Feinberg \nBook, \nautobiography \n“For me, I didn’t know that I \nknew any trans people, and I \ndidn’t have the internet, so I was \nlike, it’s almost like a historical \ncusp, when I was coming out, you \nknow. When Stone Butch Blues \nwas published in the mid 90s, I \nread it and that’s when I was like \noh my god, that’s what I am – \nthat’s me, now I get that, you \nknow” \n“Stone Butch Blues, Leslie Feinberg’s 1993 first \nnovel, is widely considered in and outside the U.S. \nto be a groundbreaking work about the \ncomplexities of gender. Feinberg was the first \ntheorist to advance a Marxist concept of \n“transgender liberation” (Leslie Feinberg, 2019). \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 171 \n \n \nChad \nBackground Information \n Chad is a transgender queer man, of an ethnic and cultural minority. He was born in the \n1970s, raised by traditional parents who understood Chad’s masculine presentation as a child as \na “tomboy phase”. He describes his parents support of his gender identity as ambivalent, \nindicating that he and his parents did not have the knowledge or language to understand Chad’s \ntransgender experience: \nI wouldn't say that I didn't have support when I was younger. That's probably factually \ntrue, but I don't think anybody knew. We didn't have the language for it. Nobody knew \nwhat was going on, not like now. So I don't want to say my parents weren't supportive, I \nwould say we just didn't know what's going on. When I was transitioning in my twenties, \nyes, they did fight it, but they eventually came around. \n Chad spent his childhood and early adulthood in the eastern U.S. He describes identifying \nas butch lesbian during adolescence and early adulthood until he entered college. He states that \nwhen he started college he began meeting new groups of people, and people with identities he \nhad not previously been aware of or familiar with. It was this process of learning about new \npeople and new identities that Chad found a name for his gender experience – transgender: \nIt was when I actually went to college and met gay people. I was like, “Oh, maybe I’m \ngay”. That was mid to late nineties, and at that time people were already starting to use \nthe word transgender and talk about it and I was like, I’m Trans. So I dropped out of \nschool. Figured out how to transition. Then transitioned. \n Chad describes his choice to transition socially and medically as affecting his decision to \nstay in school. He describes the process of recognizing his transgender identity as “scary and \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 172 \n \nfreaky”, but says that finally having the terminology necessary to label his experience gave him \nthe ability to start making changes and “get right with myself”. Chad states that discontinuing \nschool was a necessary part of this life changing transition: \nI really had been spinning my wheels in school and I couldn't figure out what was wrong. \nI think that when I was finally able to accept that I was trans and that I needed to do \nsomething - it took a while for me to swallow that one because it was really scary and \nfreaky. I was like, I need to get right with myself first and then with my life. So I dropped \nout of everything – it was mostly just school - so I could fix myself and move on. \n After leaving school, Chad entered a male dominated trade that from the beginning \nrecognized Chad as a man. Chad says that this environment simplified the gender transition \nprocess, as he “didn’t have to deal with using the mens’ rooms and the womens’ rooms because \non the job site it’s just a bunch of Port-o-Johns”, and his place of work recognized his male \nidentity. Chad’s lack of support in childhood and adolescence as a transgender child, and adult \ngender transition process, contributed to his decision to engage in advocacy efforts upon moving \nto New Mexico. \n I became acquainted with Chad through my participation in panels facilitated by a non-\nprofit agency. Chad was another volunteer with the agency who frequently attended panels and \nshared about his experience. I obtained Chad’s email by reaching out to the individual who \nfacilitates the agency’s panels. I then emailed Chad to inquire about his willingness to participate \nin this study. Chad agreed to participate and stated that he was excited to contribute. \nInterview Context \n The interview occurred at a Starbucks coffee shop near campus, just down the street from \nChad’s work place where he works for the city. Although Chad stated that the location provided \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 173 \n \nadequate privacy, he seemed to speak in hushed tones when using the words “transgender”, \n“lesbian”, or “gay”. During the interview, Chad disclosed that although he is open about his \ntransgender identity, he does not often have the opportunity to be “out” as a transgender man.  \n Chad stated that at his place of work, very few coworkers are aware that he was assigned \nfemale at birth, and know him only as the male he presents as. Chad also stated that his queer \nidentity is not known, as his partner is female presenting, and sexual and affectual orientation are \nnot common topics of discussion. Chad stated that he discusses his transgender identity when it \n“comes up”:  \nIt's nice when someone who is also trans comes up and we can relate on something down \nto earth because I think that it normalizes it. Trans people, queer people, we're \neverywhere and you wouldn't even know. We're just like you. I mean not, not that you're \ntrying to dress like everyone else, but the point is like, it's not a big deal. \n It seemed as though Chad was not necessarily uncomfortable speaking openly about these \naspects of his identity in public, but simply that he was not accustomed to it. He also reported \nfeeling concerned that he would not have enough experience with transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth to contribute to the study. Chad not only provided a rich, diverse narrative about \nhis experience as an activist within the transgender community, he also shared his own personal \nexperience transitioning medically and socially as a transgender man. His willingness to be \nvulnerable during the interview enabled me to see the connections between his experience as a \ntransgender person, and his perspective as an advocate. \n The interview lasted a total of 54 minutes, which included the time spent completing the \ndemographic questionnaire. Chad also provided a brief list of advocacy artifacts. \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 174 \n \n While reviewing Chad’s data during the analysis process, three major categories \nemerged: “Development as an advocate”, “sociopolitical context” with an emphasis on cultural \ncontext and events, and “acts of advocacy”. The experiences Chad disclosed during the interview \nwere distinct from other participants, as he grew up in the eastern U.S., in a traditional family, \nnavigating both cultural and social mores that rejected any diversion from the sex assigned at \nbirth. \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nPersonal Motivation to Advocate \n Throughout the interview, Chad seemed to minimize the difficulties he experienced when \ntransitioning without the support of family, and with little resources. Chad describes himself as \nestablishing relationships with members of the LGBTQ community upon entering college, but \nthat he was “spinning [his] wheels” in school and needed to “drop everything” to “get right” with \nhimself. Chad’s experience transitioning medically and socially with few supports inspired him \nto seek opportunities where he could support transgender and gender-expansive youth, providing \nthese young people with the love and encouragement that he was unable to find during his own \ntransition. \n Chad describes initially lacking awareness of this being a motivating factor for his \nadvocacy work. He says that it was not until a colleague and friend in the non-profit industry \ngave him a “heads up” that working with transgender and gender-expansive youth could be \ntriggering that he recognized his own unresolved grief. Chad reports having to engage in self-\ngrieving while engaging in advocacy work in order to process the grief associated with making it \nthrough the difficult process of transitioning without the love and support of others. Even during \nthe interview, Chad became overwhelmed with emotion while discussing this experience:  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 175 \n \nI get a little verklempt, but I have to tell you, I remember this distinct moment where I \nthought to myself, “I still want to be here for these youth”, and yet I really grieved the \nfact that I couldn't be there for myself. Nobody was there for me in that way. It's weird, \nyou're happy to be able to be there for young people but can’t help but feel a little bit of \nself-grieving that you didn't have that when you were going through that stuff. Yes we \nmade it, but we need to take that little bit of time to stroke our young self and say, “It's \nokay. It's okay”.  \nWitnessing a Shifting Worldview \n While noting the lack of support and resources available to him and other transgender and \ngender expansive individuals 20 years ago, Chad also described a recent shift in many members \nof society’s worldview. He says that more people are aware of the multitude of gender identities, \nand existence of transgender children: \nEven though that's only 2 years ago, what struck me at the time was - since I was \ntransitioning 20 years ago - how things are now, how trans stuff has blown up. Just the \nidea that we're having an interview about Trans children! People never recognized Trans \nchildren when I was transitioning, much less when I was growing up. \n Chad seems to view the new awareness within society of transgender and gender-\nexpansive identities as a dramatic and positive shift from when he transitioned 20 years ago. He \nappears excited about this shift and attributes the change to the work of advocates and visibility \nof transgender and gender-expansive persons, particularly youth within the transgender and \ngender-expansive community. \nActing as an Agent of Change \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 176 \n \n Upon moving to New Mexico, Chad became acquainted with two transgender men who \nfacilitated a social group. The social group consisted of several transgender men who would “go \nout socially” or meet at one another’s homes about once per month. Chad describes this initial \ngroup as bringing together members of the transgender and gender-expansive community who \neventually mobilized the resources necessary to initiate a non-profit entity: \nThe [people] who [started the non-profit entity]…I was friends with them, so I first \nmoved here back in 07' and there were no resources. There were some coed support \ngroups it was through the coed groups that a bunch of Trans men met; we'd go out \nsocially. But what we started to do was we got into the habit of meeting once a month in \neach other's houses, and that went on for a couple years, then it kind of died down. But \nwhat came up its place was the [non-profit agency]. It was not just for us, but for \neverybody. \n When the founders officially opened the non-profit entity, they announced that they were \nlooking for someone to facilitate the support group. Chad says that he learned about the non-\nprofit entity’s need for a youth group support facilitator because of his friendship with the \nfounders of the agency. He describes feeling called to volunteer to assist with the group because \nhe had not engaged in activist work since he had left the eastern U.S. Chad’s desire to promote \nthe empowerment and wellbeing of the transgender and gender-expansive community played a \nmajor role in his decision to act as a group leader: \nI’m not originally from here. I’m from [the eastern U.S.], and I transitioned in early 2000. \nI was really an activist back then - but once I moved to New Mexico - not so much. It's \nsomething about the timing that in 2014 I felt like I should do something for the \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 177 \n \ncommunity here. So it just kind of fell into place. I volunteered to facilitate the youth \ngroup for the [non-profit entity] at that time and I did it for about two years. \n Chad’s approach to advocacy is to act as an agent of change by providing transgender \nand gender-expansive youth with a safe space, validation, and group support. Chad’s own \nexperience with lack of access to support and resources during his medical and social gender \ntransition helped inform his decision to volunteer in a role that enabled him to provide youth \nwith the resources and support that he himself had lacked. His experience as a transgender man \nand former trans youth provided a source of motivation, and foundation of knowledge for \nenabling him to relate to and meet the needs of this population. \n Later in the interview, Chad describes how his own coming out process is inextricably \nintertwined with his advocacy work. He states, “It's weird, I don't even think of [advocacy] as \nseparate. It was all part of transitioning. So it felt like it was just part of my personal transition”. \nChad seems to view his own work in advocacy and activism as part of transitioning, of \nembracing his identity as a transgender man, and contributing to his community. \nPerspective as Rooted in Personal Experience \n Chad describes a period of time during his medical and social gender transition where his \noutward appearance was still perceived as feminine, and his legal documents and identification \nreflected his accurate male identity. He says that he was placed in situations where people had to \naccept the discrepancy between their original perception of his gender, and his self-reported \ngender identity. Chad also describes having to explain his changing appearance and male identity \nto persons who had previously known him as a female. It was during this period of time that \nChad became aware of the importance of “taking someone’s word for it” when they share \nsomething about themselves. Chad describes this experience: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 178 \n \nI told people, “Look, I don't know what to tell you. I understand that I was assigned \nfemale at birth. I understand that you used to know me as a woman. I understand that you \nstill agree I’m a woman. I get it. I understand that I haven't had access to medical \ntransition. I understand all those things. Maybe the legal changes haven't gone through. \nI’m telling you I am not a woman and you can either believe that or not”. What I \nremember from those days and what I learned, what I still try to remember now when I’m \nfaced with my own prejudices, is that if someone tells me something about themselves, I \nshould take their word for it and that's it. Because that was me and that was it. It was all I \nhad. My body was contradictory to how I felt. Circumstances are contradictory to how I \nfelt. I felt that papers were contradictory. It was all I could do to get people to see that. \nAnd so I’m constantly being reminded that I have to do that for others. \n In the preceding statement, Chad seems to acknowledge how personal experience with \nprejudice and the dysphoria associated with a lack of congruence between outward appearance \nand inward experience taught him the importance of respecting other’s disclosed identities. Chad \nalso seems to have tapped into a well of empathy, such that when confronted with a person at \nthis extra difficult point in their gender transition, Chad’s emotional experience from that time in \nhis own life is re-experienced. The field of counseling and psychology recognize this experience \nas a common experience for helping professionals when assisting a client whose experience in \nsome way parallels their own. The formal title for this experience is “countertransference”, and if \nthe helping professional is aware of this phenomenon it can enhance empathy between helper \nand helped (Burwell-Pender & Halinski, 2008). \n The strong connection between Chad’s personal experience and his perspective on \nadvocacy work is also evident in his statements about the high stakes of gender dysphoria. Chad \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 179 \n \nstates that he did not have a choice about whether or not to pursue medical transition, that he had \nto physically change his gender presentation to align with his internal experience in order to \ncontinue living. He further speaks to this experience within the transgender community, stating \nthat the increased rate of suicide may be related to the experience of gender dysphoria, which \noccurs when one is unable to achieve congruence between outward appearance and internal \nidentity:  \nI think what's at play - because it was at play for me - is there's courage, and then there's \nthat you can't do anything else. I mean you could do something else, which is why I guess \nsuicidality is really high in the trans community, but if you're going to choose to live and \nnot die, then you almost don't have a choice. People talk about being courageous and all \nthis stuff, but really you don't have a choice. This is who I am and I can't be any other \nway and I don't have a choice. \nSociopolitical Context \n During his interview, Chad provided a timeline of personally impactful sociopolitical \nevents that occurred during his gender transition and his active years as an activist and advocate. \nOne example of these events was when a city employee in Chad’s hometown became the first \nperson employed by the to be open about their transgender identity. Chad described this person \nas being part of his social circle of LGBTQ activist friends. He also in a march in a pride parade \nthat 20 years ago previously excluded members of the transgender community to participate in \nthe major pride demonstration. \nCultural Events \n These experiences, and other sociopolitical events, contributed to Chad’s development as \nan activist. He also describes personal experiences as a youth, specifically with members of his \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 180 \n \nfamily and community, as impacting his understanding of the needs of trans and gender-\nexpansive youth. Chad describes how gender norms promote masculinity as the most desirable \ncharacteristic for both genders, until puberty. He states that society requires youth to “fall in \nline” when they reach puberty, aligning their gender presentation with the sex assigned at birth: \nIf you want to run around looking like a boy and acting like a boy to a certain degree, it's \nokay. I think once you hit puberty, people start to expect you to kind of fall in line. The \nreason I say that is only because I don't see that same space for people who are assigned \nmale at birth, I don't see a lot of school age boys who are allowed to grow their hair long, \nor God forbid wear a skirt. I don't think I’ve ever seen that. It's just not allowed. I think \nwe live in a culture that's still misogynistic and the masculine rules. If you want to act \nlike a dude, that's fine, up to a certain point. Once you hit puberty, you better do your \nthing. God forbid a little boy wants to act like a girl. I don't think it's safe, and that's our \nfault as the adults. The point is, I don't see a lot of safety for those little trans kids. \n Chad further explains how his own experience as a child who was labeled a “tomboy” \naligned with the aforementioned description of society’s expectations of gender. He describes \nhow his parents, whose culture influenced their beliefs about gender norms, encouraged Chad’s \nmasculine “tomboy” behavior and presentation until he reached puberty. Chad says that at that \ntime, his father and mother expected him “fall in line”. Chad describes his parents’ rejection of \nmasculine behavior as contributing to his decision to remain closeted until college, and that this \nexperience has also helped him to relate to young transgender and gender non-conforming youth \nwho have experienced rejection. \nActs of Advocacy \nTrans Youth: Seeking “Reflections of themselves” and a Safe Space \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 181 \n \n Tapping into his experience as the leader of a support group for transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth, Chad provided insight regarding the needs of this group. Where one might \nexpect to hear that these young people needed access to hormones, or hormone blockers, or \ngender transition related care, Chad instead described how these young people are seeking \n“reflections of themselves” and a safe space to meet other transgender and gender-expansive \npeople: \nFor the youth, it was more about just finding each other, and a little bit about finding role \nmodels. It was about finding reflections of themselves. To establish rapport, we just had \nto be supportive and then get out of their way. Just provide a space for them to be with \neach other. \n Chad further describes being visible as a transgender person as an act of advocacy that \nprovides transgender youth with more opportunities for seeing themselves represented positively \nin the world. He states that visibility of transgender members of the community shows that the \ncrisis that accompanies rejection and gender dysphoria is temporary, and that there is “a way \nout”. In the quote below, Chad speaks to the need for youth to have people they can think of who \nhave survived gender dysphoria and rejection, and built fulfilling lives: \n…seeing a way out, being in the moment of crisis and not being able to think to yourself \n– other than a celebrity because celebrities are so far out of reach anyhow – “Oh I know \nso and so and they were able to find a partner and they have a good job and they live a \nnormal life and this is just a phase and all the shit I’m dealing with right now is only \ntemporary”. You need to have something that you could think about that's beyond that \nmoment. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 182 \n \n Chad further describes how his role as an advocate and youth group leader is to ensure \nthat transgender and gender-expansive youth have a “safe space”: \nI think that my job in that role was mainly to provide a safe space and be an accessible \nTrans adult so they could be with each other and could also see adults that reflected them. \nEducation & Outreach \n Referring back to his experience as an activist while living in the eastern U.S. \nimmediately before, during, and after his medical and social gender transition, Chad reports \nassisting with efforts to provide interested community members within the queer community \nwith education about gender identity. He also describes collaborating with “gay advocacy \ngroups” to gain permission for the transgender community to participate in the pride parade. \nThese efforts ensured that the transgender community had a home within the greater LGBTQ \ncommunity, and that community members had an accurate understanding of the T in LGBTQ. \n Chad also participated in panels at the university he had previously attended, where Chad \nwas asked to participate and “be the trans presence on the panels”. He states that his participation \nas a panelist helped “start to brand a community” for transgender and gender-expansive students \non campus and introduced many students to transgender identity. \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n The primary categories that emerged from Chad’s data included: “Development as an \nadvocate”, “sociopolitical context”, and “acts of advocacy”. Chad’s interview narrative outlined \nhis development as an advocate, to include motivations for becoming an advocate/activist, his \nexperience witnessing a shift in U.S. society’s view on gender identity development in young \npeople, and how Chad’s personal experience as a transgender person has impacted his \nperspective and efforts as an advocate. Chad’s disclosures during the interview also spoke to his \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 183 \n \nspecific approach to advocacy, and how he has sought to provide transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth with a “reflection of themselves” in him and other advocates. Chad also \ndescribed using education and outreach as a means of increasing both the LGBT community and \nsociety’s understanding of the T in LGBTQ. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n One of the questions posed to Chad during the interview was whether he had any \nadvocacy related materials he would recommend. When Chad asked for clarification about what \nthese materials ought to include, I emphasized the role of these materials in helping me better \nunderstand advocacy for this population, and/or his perspective on advocacy. Chad seemed to \ndefine advocacy artifacts as those resources that helped him to understand transgender identity, \nand the history of the transgender community. Table 12 outlines the advocacy artifacts \nrecommended by Chad, to include the title, type, and a summary description of item from the \nsource. \nTable 12 \nAdvocacy Artifacts - Chad \nArtifact Title  Artifact Type Summary Description from Source  \nPersonal video diaries \nof transgender \nindividual’s \nexperiences with \ngender transition  \nYoutube videos See Youtube.com keyword “gender transition” for \nmore information. \n“Boys Don’t Cry” Film, based on a \ntrue story about \nBrandon Teena \n“Young female-to-male transgender Brandon \nTeena (Hilary Swank) leaves his hometown under \nthreat when his ex-girlfriend's brother discovers \nthat he's biologically female.

But when \nher ex-convict friends, John (Peter Sarsgaard) and \nTom (Brendan Sexton III), learn Brandon's secret, \nthings change very quickly” (Google.com, 2019). \n \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 184 \n \nJanet \nBackground Information \n Janet is a white gay/lesbian cisgender female, whose highest level of education is a \nmasters degree and post graduate Educational Specialist (EdS). Janet currently resides in New \nMexico and works in K-12 education. At the time of the interview, she was planning to retire and \nreported her income as between $50,000 and $74,999. \n I became acquainted with Janet through my faculty supervisor who recommended I reach \nout to her regarding her work supporting transgender youth in the school system. My faculty \nsupervisor had assisted Janet with trainings and presentations regarding the needs of LGBTQ \nyouth within the school environment. He provided me with Janet’s contact information and gave \npermission for me to disclose that he had recommended I reach out to her. When I called to \ninquire about her willingness to participate in the study, Janet agreed to participate, and we \narranged to meet at a coffee shop to complete the interview. \n Janet reports a rich history of advocacy for LGBTQ students, beginning with her \nparticipation an LGBTQ task force in K-12 education 15 years ago. Janet’s involvement with the \ntask force included assistance with identifying LGBTQ student’s unmet needs, organizing \ntrainings, developing LGBTQ affirming policy, and consulting with school administration \nregarding LGBTQ student’s needs. She describes creating her own job description, as she \nattended to the needs of the students and administration in her school district. She says that she \nplans on retiring soon and is concerned about whether her predecessor will continue her \nadvocacy work. \n Some of Janet’s major achievements as an advocate include establishing a Safe Zone \nprogram, creating transgender and gender-expansive affirming school policies, and infusing \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 185 \n \nschool personnel trainings with gender identity education. The Safe Zone program consisted of a \ntraining which at least one teacher or administrator from each school was required to attend. \nThose adults who attend the training are labeled “safe” persons and provided a Safe Zone \nrainbow sticker to display in their office or classroom indicating that they are an LGBTQ \naffirming person. Safe Zone ensures that at least one school employee within each school has the \neducation and skills necessary to effectively support LGBTQ students. \n The transgender and gender-expansive affirming school policies Janet helped to create \nincluded specific instructions regarding how to address harassment of LGBTQ students, and a \nstructured “Gender Support Plan” created to guide school administrators in their support of a \nstudent’s gender transition within the school environment. Janet’s final major achievement in the \nrealm of LGBTQ advocacy was her infusion of gender identity education in the sexual \nharassment and bullying prevention training all school personnel are required to attend. Janet’s \nability to generate change and create new programming left a legacy that will serve multiple \ngenerations of LGBTQ youth. \nInterview Context \n Janet and I completed the interview at a coffee shop located at the corner of a busy \nintersection in a metropolitan area. It was late in the afternoon, after Janet had completed a full \nday of work, but she seemed fully engaged and excited to discuss her advocacy efforts. The \ncoffee shop was busy, and the background music loud, so Janet spoke directly into the \nmicrophone of my recorder for the majority of the interview. Although the noise made recording \na bit difficult, it ensured that our conversation was inaudible to other patrons in the coffee shop, \nand Janet stated that the space provided adequate privacy. The interview lasted a total of 57 \nminutes. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 186 \n \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n As a researcher, one of the primary lessons I learned through the interview, transcription, \nand analysis process was that each participant has a unique story regarding how they came to \nadvocate for transgender and gender-expansive youth. That unique story is often tied to their \nown coming out process, and experience with friends, family, and members of their community. \nIn order to understand this part of each participant’s journey, all I needed to do was follow up my \nquestions from the interview protocol with more summative reflections of what they had shared.  \n Janet’s interview was one of the first three interviews to be completed and transcribed, \nthus I had not yet learned the importance of reflecting back my participant’s statements. These \nreflections allowed my participants enough space to share what was essentially a painful \ncomplex narrative about coming out, experiencing rejection and ambivalence from others, and \nfinding peace and healing by giving back through advocacy work. The categories and themes \nlisted below are similar to those identified in previous participants’ data but lack the inclusion of \npersonal details and sense of vulnerability evident in some participant’s narratives. \nPersonal Journey & Development as an Advocate \n Janet is an expert in understanding the school as an institution, and system. Her work as \nan advocate blossomed out of her belief that LGBTQ students have a right to a learning \nenvironment free from discrimination and harassment. As an advocate within K-12 education, \nJanet describes working on both the individual and systems levels to assist LGBTQ students. She \nseems inspired by the “happy endings” her work has helped to create: \nI love being the one that schools call to consult with when they are like “We don’t know \nwhat to do”. And I don’t know that I would have the perfect answer, but helping them \nnavigate the best that we can, because I feel like if I wasn’t here to do it I’m not sure who \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 187 \n \nwould do it. I feel good about having resources and I love to do that. And over the years \nit seems that different things that have come up, some that have had happy endings. \nLearning to Strategize  \n Janet’s advocacy evolved over time, as she learned how to effectively construct and \npropose LGBTQ affirming policy in her school district. She says that when proposing new \npolicy, it is important to “be strategic and not go crazy”. Specifically, Janet describes how she \nand the advocates who collaborated to create the affirming school policies were careful to ensure \nthat they proposed the new policies at the appropriate time. She says that they recognized that in \norder to get the policies approved and implemented, they needed to propose the new policies \nwhen supportive school administrators were in power: \nI knew I needed to go underground. I had been pushing too much and it was clear I \nneeded to go underground. So once [the unsupportive school administrator] left and we \ngot the interim, I very quietly – very quietly had called [the co-director of the resource \ncenter] and said you need to get the community together, now is the time to push if we \nwant to get stuff through. \n Janet also speaks to the importance of maintaining positive public relationships with \nschool administrators. She describes reining in her passion for pursuing positive change for these \nyouth in order to ensure that she treads lightly and is not “an activist in your face”. Janet re-\nemphasizes how essential timing is when proposing new policy, as reflected in her statement \nabout “waiting on the administration” to ensure that LGBTQ affirming programs such as Safe \nZone are maintained: \nI had gotten braver over the years, I was a lot more skittish in the beginning, but you \nknow I’m an administrator, I’m not going to be an activist in your face, because PR \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 188 \n \n(Public Relations) is not going to go away. You’ve got to get organized, you’ve got to get \nin very carefully, because if you don’t programs like Safe Zone are going to go away in a \nyear or two. So our goal was to wait on the administration, so that it wouldn’t get \ndestroyed, and I think we’ve done a good job of that. \n Strategy is necessary to prevent outright rejection of overtly LGBTQ affirming policy \nand programming. Janet points out how many individuals exposed to the current Safe Zone and \nother LGBTQ positive programs and trainings have asked why these programs are not offered at \nthe elementary school level. Although she believes strongly that these programs ought to be \noffered in the elementary schools, she acknowledges that many people “start freaking out” when \nLGBTQ programming is offered to younger school age children. As an advocate pursuing \npositive change for these youth, Janet states that she initially focuses on LGBTQ positive \npolicies and programming for older students, as she is less likely to meet opposition when \nproposing programs for this age group:  \nA lot of people asked when I was doing the trainings “Why is this not in elementary \nschools?”. And I think that I would like to see it there, and there was a lot of discussion \nabout it early on, but early on we were like we are not taking that on because that could \nmake other things change because when you start looking at elementary that’s when \npeople start freaking out. So I hope that that is on the horizon \n Another essential aspect of strategy in advocacy work is enabling persons belonging to \nthe LGBTQ community to share their narrative and facilitate education about their community \nand identity. Janet describes the value of having LGBTQ individuals, or the parent(s) of an \nLGBTQ student who has been harassed, help facilitate the “tolerance curriculum”. She reports \nsome difficulty in gaining permission from the schools to allow her “to bring in a gay person”, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 189 \n \nbut that when she is able to include a community member as part of the training, it greatly \nimproves the delivery of the message: \nRight, and a piece of that was a pilot that was called the Tolerance Curriculum. That’s \nwhat they’ve done, it’s been different things over the years, but it includes programs with \nthe kids where they talk about different kinds of diversity. I remember the counselor who \nhas mainly done it over the years, she brought in a guest speaker when it was time for the \nsexual orientation piece but she couldn’t actually get permission to bring in a gay person. \nSo it was the parent of a gay student who had been harassed; like how can you argue with \na mom who is crying because her kid was beat up because they were gay? \n The need for such strategy when pursuing positive social change for transgender and \ngender-expansive youth (and LGBTQ youth in general) brings to light the pervasive nature of \noppression. Janet describes how affirming policy for this population is often responded to so \nnegatively by the community, even though these policies are in no way detrimental to the \nexperience of other students. When faced with the reality that so many members of the \ncommunity oppose LGBTQ affirming programs and policies, advocates such as Janet must \nbecome creative in how they propose change. \nActs of Advocacy in the School Environment \nPursuing Systems-level Change \n Transgender and gender-expansive youth face a variety of challenges in the school \nenvironment, from gendered harassment from peers, to unequal treatment from teachers and \nschool administration. Janet describes multiple instances where – prior to the creation of the \ntransgender and gender-expansive affirming policies – one school’s administration would \naccommodate a transgender child (i.e. changing their name and gender marker in the school’s \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 190 \n \ncomputer system and on educational materials), while another school’s administration would \nrefuse to make any changes saying “We can’t do that”. \n Janet collaborated with multiple LGBTQ advocacy groups to address each of the \naforementioned challenges faced by transgender and gender-expansive youth in the school \nenvironment. Regarding these efforts, Janet stated: \nThey had a bunch of really great ideas, and a lot of those required the principal’s \npermission. But one of the people who came to me was John (name changed for privacy) \nwho volunteered with [a non-profit entity], and we had talked about some programs, like \nthe national Safe Zone program, which no one had heard about, we didn’t have it here in \nNew Mexico at all. And it was basically defining safe adults in the high school that a kid \nis in, that they could go to without being revictimized. \n Collaborating with community members and other LGBTQ groups lead to the creation of \nthe LGBT task force, transgender task force, and LGBT advisory council. These task \nforces/councils worked together to generate affirming policies and programs, to include the \naforementioned affirming policies, and Safe Zone program. Janet describes these groups as \nidentifying a school district in San Francisco with “model” policies for accommodating and \nsupporting transgender and gender-expansive youth. She states that she and the other task force \nmembers borrowed from this school district’s policy, and from “resolution agreements” from \ncases where schools had failed to support transgender and gender expansive youth:  \nI will say that there was a third incarnation of that community group. When we had a \nchange in administration, my supervisor and I had created what we called the LGBT \nadvisory council, and it was made of a lot of people and a lot of community members. So \nit was a subcommittee of that. And we lifted a ton of it from the San Francisco model \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 191 \n \nprogram. So we took a ton out of it. It was basically San Francisco that operationalized \n[transgender affirming policy]. And we also took a lot from Office of Civil Rights \n(OCR), a couple of resolution agreements with different schools who weren’t doing what \nthey needed to do. And we just took a ton from their resolution agreements because we \nfigured, obviously we couldn’t be going wrong if we were taking it from OCR \nagreements. So, that’s why it was so thorough. \n Janet created policy by collaborating with other advocates, and referencing what other \nschools did well, and where other schools failed. Her approach emphasized the role of strategy in \nensuring that the policies were “thorough” and could make it through the processes necessary to \nbe implemented at the district level. Janet describes the importance of creating formal policy to \nprotect transgender and gender-expansive youth, stating that policy “backs” the actions of \nsupportive administrators and prevents unsupportive school personnel from “running out” \naffirming staff: \nI think we have a lot of supportive administrators, but when there was no policy backing \nthem that really left them very vulnerable, because then if you have communities of \npeople who are not supportive or want to run you out, they can do that. And so really we \nneed it not just for the trans kids and families but we also needed it for the protection of \nthe administrators so that they can say I’m following procedures. \nThe Influence of Persons in Power.  Janet references how the attitude of persons in power \nwithin the school impact her ability to implement new LGBTQ affirming policies and \nprogramming. She provides one clear cut example when describing how she and her committee \nwere unable to successfully pass new LGBTQ affirming school policies for years because of an \nunsupportive superintendent:  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 192 \n \nSo [the task force and council] met for about two and a half years, to come up with some \npolicies and procedures. And we met with the superintendent at the time, that wasn’t very \nsupportive at all. So our hands were really tied, and we couldn’t do all of the things we \nreally wanted. But we came up with the [affirming policy], with what we needed to do, \nbut the superintendent changed it at the last minute, and then took it in front of the board. \nAnd the way that he changed it was to have everything default to the birth certificate. \nOkay then, well there went all of that work! \n The superintendent’s power within the hierarchy of school administrators enabled him to \nprevent the implementation of policies and programs based upon his own personal beliefs. For \nJanet, understanding the superintendent’s ability to influence the creation of policy lead her to \nutilize strategies such as timing and careful selection of language used in policy. She describes \nwaiting for a supportive administration before submitting the current version of LGBTQ \naffirming policy: \nSince then of course we’ve got a new administration who has for the most part been \nreally really supportive. And so a couple of years ago we finally were able to put through \nour draft of the [transgender and gender-expansive affirming policies]. \n Janet also describes using language with a “broader context” to ensure that the policy is \nnot perceived as only benefiting LGBTQ persons, but instead protects members of multiple \nprotected groups: \nYou don’t just go after sexual orientation or gender identity because you are going to \nhave problems. That was the lesson, you can’t go about it that way. It’s got to be in a \nbroader context. Whether it be disability, or race, or whatever. \nPursuing Change at the Individual-level \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 193 \n \n When asked about memorable instances of advocacy work (a specific question from the \ninterview protocol), Janet described the first transgender youth she worked with as a district \nadministrator. The child was in the fourth grade when she “starting to talk with her mom” about \nher female identity. Janet says that the girl was “starting to wear necklaces, and do her hair, and \nwear nail polish” when she and her mom approached the school administration about how to \nhandle the girl’s gender transition in school.  \n Janet states that the mother was “super supportive” of the young girl’s gender identity \nand desire to socially transition and “wasn’t totally unreasonable and understood how schools are \ntoo. She walked a really fine line”. Janet describes working with the girl and her mother to \ndetermine when would be the best time for the girl to socially transition, and whether the girl \nwished to remain at the same school during the transition. Janet states that she assisted the girl \nand her mother when they elected to transfer to a middle school that was a better “fit” during the \ntransition. Janet also acted as a consultant for the school’s administration, describing an occasion \nwhere the school called to ask about gender specific accommodations during “overnight trips”. \n In the instance described above, Janet acted on an individual level to advocate for a \nyoung transgender girl. Janet’s advocacy for this child was essential, as the school system had \nnot yet created policies to ensure she received the support she needed during social transition. In \nthis instance, individual level advocacy consisted of validating the individual child and her \naffirming parent, ensuring that her learning environment was safe and supportive, and helping \nher transfer schools to meet this need, while also supporting school personnel who interacted \nwith the child to enable them to provide appropriate care. \nResources within the School Environment for Transgender and Gender-Expansive Youth. \nEducators are becoming increasingly aware of the diversity of gender identities, and of gender \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 194 \n \nidentity development. Janet describes how she has witnessed teachers at the “elementary level” \nwho cultivate curiosity in the classroom regarding gender, and promote acceptance and \ncelebration of differences: \nSo I think that kids are maybe younger and younger, talking about pronouns at the \nelementary level. I think a lot of it is just really wonderful, particularly that we have \nteachers at the early elementary level already talking about it. That it’s more about \nexploring gender and it’s okay to be you and whatever differences make you you. That’s \nour prerogative. \n Teachers who cultivate curiosity about gender and enable children to explore this aspect \nof their identity act as an important resource for transgender and gender-expansive (and LGBTQ \nchildren in general) students. These adults enable safe conversation, and model acceptance of all \nidentities. Teachers and other school personnel may also complete the Safe Zone training, \ncreated and implemented by Janet in her school district, and become a formally recognized “safe \nadult” in the school. \n Other resources for transgender and gender-expansive students include the Genders and \nSexualities Alliances (GSA, formerly known as Gay Straight Alliance), “safe place” lunch \ngroups, PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and local agencies that \nserve the transgender and gender-expansive community. Janet states that while the GSA and \nlunch groups are available on school campus, PFLAG and local agencies are often accessed \nthrough the help of a school counselor. \nA lot of the schools have GSAs, Gay Straight Alliances. Now if you have a Gay Straight \nAlliance in the district then it falls under the schools clubs so they have to have a sponsor \nand they have to have bylaws. So not every year do we have a group of kids who is up to \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 195 \n \ndo all of that, because sometimes they are not a true GSA sometimes they are more of a \nlunch group maybe if a teacher is wanting to do something then they will have a safe \nplace for kids to come in and have lunch and do whatever activities they do.  \n Janet states that due to their status as minors, students’ ability to access resources and \nsupport is limited based upon whether or not their parents consent to the student receiving such \nsupport. She describes how some parents have positive affirming responses to their child’s \ninvolvement in school resources, while others demand that their child be refused such resources. \nJanet reflects on parent responses to their child’s access of school resources for LGBTQ students \nand their allies in the excerpt below: \nWe have had counselors who have tried to access resources and help support parents who \nare trying to learn, but it’s hard because there’s that parent that might make you angry \nbecause they want nothing to do with it, but then you have that parent who comes in who \nsays, “Oh my gosh this is not my world! I’m so new to this I don’t know anything!”, so \nwe hook them up with a resource. It could be PFLAG, we’ve done a lot now with John \n[name changed for privacy] and we have a lot of people at [local non-profit agencies], so \ndoing that. I’ve definitely had calls through the years – I remember at one of the high \nschools the mom called the GSA sponsor and said “I just really don’t want my kid in that \ngroup”, and I said “Well I’m not going to kick the kid out of the group”, so what the \nadministration said was “Well then we need to call her and let her know”. And she ended \nup pulling the kid out of school.  \n Janet describes the high stakes for LGBTQ kids whose parents fail to accept their identity \nand/or revoke support upon learning of their child’s identity. She describes how parents’ ability \nto influence their child’s access to resources due to their minor status makes things “really hard”, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 196 \n \nand how she gives parents “a lot of statistics” about the effects of family rejection on youth’s \nhealth. In the quote below, Janet references the Family Acceptance Project (Ryan, 2009) results \nwhich indicate that children whose caregivers are ambivalent or rejecting of their child’s gender \nidentity have a significantly increased rate of suicide attempts, and substance use. She describes \nhow parents and caregivers who reject their child’s identity and/or refuse them access to \nresources at school, place their child’s safety at risk: \nSo it’s really hard because the parents have the final say so, and so part of it is we really \nwant to support these kids. I mean, kids die, I give a lot of statistics, because you may \nhave your own beliefs or whatever and that’s fine but we’ve got to keep kids safe, \nbecause kids die and get hooked on drugs. What a difference it makes when your family \nsupports you. \nSociopolitical Context \nThe Trump Administration  \n Parents’ attitudes towards their transgender or gender-expansive child directly impacts \nthe health and wellbeing of that child. The social and political context in which children are \nimbedded also directly impacts their experience, both through their experiences of \ndiscrimination, and access to resources. Janet speaks to the influence of sociopolitical context on \nthe needs of transgender and gender-expansive youth in the school environment in her school \ndistrict: \nWell it was really helpful and certainly we were pretty ready to go about what we wanted \non the [affirming policy], but what helped was when Obama expanded Title IX it was the \nperfect time as it supported what we were doing. And then conversely when Trump \nrescinded that, everybody has been kind of waiting like “Well are the courts going to tell \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 197 \n \nus to stop following the [affirming policies]?”, and I keep saying “They are not going to \ntell us to stop doing it, they are just going to say you can do what you want now”. But I \nthink in a lot of people’s brains we might be told to stop doing it. I don’t think that’s \ngoing to happen, but people are concerned and worried that that is going to happen.  \n Janet explains how the Department of Justice Title IX interpretation for treatment of \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth in education, created under President Obama, supported \nher district’s transgender and gender-expansive affirming policies. She states that this guidance \nprovided federal-level support for LGBTQ affirming policy and programming, so that when \nPresident Trump’s administration rescinded this guidance, many allies and advocates were \nfearful that they would be required to discontinue their LGBTQ affirming practices. In the \nexcerpt below, Janet describes how she too was “nervous after the election” as she was unsure \nabout how the new administration’s stance on LGBTQ rights would influence people’s response \nto her: \nFrankly while I was doing the school trainings this year I got really nervous after the \nelection because I don’t know how the groups are going to be now, and how I’m going to \ndo the trainings if people are going to be more obstinate and more difficult, and really \nthey weren’t. I mean sure there were some of them that didn’t agree with it, but for the \nmost part they were polite and kept quiet.  \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Three major categories were evident in Janet’s data, including “personal journey and \ndevelopment as an advocate”, “acts of advocacy”, and “sociopolitical context”. Each of these \ncategories contained a multitude of school specific themes, such as “learning to strategize”, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 198 \n \n“pursuing system’s level and individual level change”, and “resources in the school \nenvironment”. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n Janet appears to define advocacy artifacts as those resources that are useful to transgender \nand gender-expansive youth, their families, and their allies. She recommends local resources \navailable to both the students and staff she works with. Table 13 outlines the advocacy artifacts \nrecommended by Janet, to include the title, type, and a summary description of item from the \nsource. \nTable 13 \nAdvocacy Artifacts - Janet \nArtifact Title  \n \nArtifact Type Summary Description from Source  \nCommon Bond Resource for \nsupport groups \nfor LGBTQ \ncommunity \nmembers \n“Here at the Common Bond New Mexico \nFoundation, our mission is to strengthen the \nLGBTQ community of New Mexico through \nprograms and partnerships that serve at-risk \nsectors of the LGBTQ population” (Common \nBond New Mexico, 2019). \nParents, Families, and \nFriends of Lesbians and \nGays (PFLAG) \nResource for \nsupport groups \nfor family, \nfriends, and \nallies \n“Uniting people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and queer (LGBTQ) with families, \nfriends, and allies, PFLAG is committed to \nadvancing equality through its mission of support, \neducation, and advocacy” (PFLAG, 2019). \nWelcomingSchools.org Online source \nfor educational \nresources for \neducating \nchildren about \nLGBTQ \nidentities \n“HRC [Human Rights Campaign] Foundation's \nWelcoming Schools is the nation's premier \nprofessional development program providing \ntraining and resources to elementary school \neducators to welcome diverse families, create \nLGBTQ and gender inclusive schools, prevent \nbias-based bullying, and support transgender and \nnon-binary students” (WelcomingSchools.org, \n2019). \n \nHelen \nBackground Information \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 199 \n \n Helen is a white gay/lesbian cisgender female, whose pronouns are she/her. She was born \nin the 1950s, and has a masters degree in education. Helen reports working for the U.S. \ngovernment in the 1970s and early 1980s, before beginning her career as a public school teacher \nin 1982. Working in the public schools, Helen states that she “didn’t announce” her identity as \nlesbian, but that “I sure couldn’t deny it”. Helen describes how she valued being authentic and \nopen with her students and co-workers, stating “when I took my teaching job, I said to myself \nthat I would never deny who I was to a kid who didn’t know the truth”. Her visibility as a \ngay/lesbian woman played a pivotal role in her development as an advocate, and the types of \nadvocacy efforts she pursued as an educator and community member. \n Helen recently retired from her career as a public school teacher, and now maintains a \nleadership role in the non-profit industry. She describes her current annual income as between \n$50,000 and $74,999, and resides in New Mexico with her partner. In addition to her leadership \nrole, Helen also collaborates with other transgender and gender-expansive affirming non-profit \nagencies and schools, and the local school district’s LGBT and transgender task forces.  \n Helen and I became acquainted after a participant recommended I reach out to Helen for \nsupport during my own advocacy work for my transgender daughter. I met with Helen in \nFebruary of 2017 regarding my advocacy efforts as a parent, and kept in touch until I began my \ndissertation study. Once I received IRB approval, I contacted Helen to ask if she would be \nwilling to engage in an audio recorded interview regarding her advocacy for transgender youth, \nand she readily agreed. \nInterview Context \n Helen and I completed the interview at a Starbucks coffee shop in a residential area near \nher home. We met during the month of June, in the early afternoon on a weekday. Business at \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 200 \n \nthe coffee shop seemed slow, and Helen and I found a table in a corner away from the \nentrance/exits, and bathroom. Helen indicated that she felt the space was adequately private for \nthe interview, and she appeared to speak openly (without speaking in hushed tones or seeming to \ncensor her statements) about her experience. She completed the demographic survey and \nreferenced several advocacy artifacts, with the interview lasting a total of 58 minutes. \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Over the course of the interview, Helen spoke to a variety of broad-based themes, from a \nmacro-level discussion of sociopolitical context to sharing about her experience as a lesbian \nteacher who was “out” about her identity in a less-than-affirming school environment. \nIdentifying themes and categories required the piecing together of points of discussion that spoke \nto similar concepts, while ensuring that quotes maintained their original context. The coding \nprocess resulted in the identification of three major categories, to include: 1) Helen’s \ndevelopment as an advocate, 2) her description of the sociopolitical context within the school \nenvironment, and macro-level sociopolitical variables that impacted LGBTQ students in the \nschool setting, and 3) specific acts of advocacy. \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nVisibility as an LGBTQ Community Member \n When Helen decided to become a school teacher, she says that she wanted to be honest \nand authentic with her students about who she is as a person – to include her identity as a lesbian. \nShe describes multiple memorable instances during her early career, in the 1980s-1990s, where \nshe experienced overt harassment from students and discrimination from school administration \nbecause of her LGBTQ identity. One particularly impactful experience occurred when Helen’s \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 201 \n \nstudents began discussing the AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) crisis after \nwatching a news clip about the issue in class: \nWe had Channel 1 news in the classroom, and Anderson Cooper was the first \ncorrespondent for Channel 1. He did a story about the AIDS crisis, and I had a student \nwho was kind of a provocateur, so when it was over he said, “Well, what do you think \nabout AIDS?”. I said, “Well, I think it’s unfortunate”, a very text book answer. He then \nsaid, “So what do you think about gay people?”, and I’m sure there was a long pause. I \nhad never actually come out as gay. People kind of knew. I was the math teacher. So, I \ndidn’t have a lot of opportunity to discuss that.  \nBut anyway, I said, “Well I am a gay person and I think it’s ok”, then I said, “does \nanybody want to ask any questions?”, because I’m not just going to say that and then go \nonto the next thing. We spent about 30 minutes, maybe not even that long and I did have \nparents call to complain.  \n Although Helen describes the experience in class as mostly positive, she says that the \nresponse of some student’s parents was negative. When the parents called to complain about \nHelen disclosing that she was gay, Helen describes a lack of support from her school’s \nadministration:  \nOur assistant principal, I told her the very same day that the conversation happened in the \nclass, and she said, “That’s really great. Good for you.” Then after she got calls from \nparents, she wrote me up on my end-of-year evaluation saying that I shared too much \npersonal information with my students. \n Helen reports meeting with the principal and utilizing the support of the teacher’s union \nto self-advocate for her right to be authentic about her identity and her life experience, and to \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 202 \n \nhave the write-up removed from her end-of-year evaluation. She says that in her meeting with \nthe principal, she framed her decision to be authentic with her students as a “teachable moment”: \nThe principal was Hispanic, and I said, “So if something came up in class about being an \nold New Mexico family or something like that, and students wanted to talk more about it, \nyou don’t think it would be appropriate to have a conversation? Or, I’m Jewish, so what \nif someone said, ‘What does that mean?’ and I spent a little bit of time talking about who \nthe Jews were, wouldn’t you think that would be me adding to a teachable moment? A \nteachable moment and helping my students understand the larger world?” \n Helen states that the write-up was removed from her record, but that the administration \nnever formally admitted any wrongdoing or outright discrimination. Despite these adverse \nexperiences, Helen remained steadfast in her resolution to be authentic with her students and be \nvisible as a member of the LGBTQ community. She describes meeting an LGBTQ person and \nunderstanding their experience as essential to helping students accept LGBTQ identities. Helen \ndesignates her visibility as an LGBTQ person as a form of advocacy that cultivates \nunderstanding in her students, and aligns with her values as an educator and advocate: \nI think it all started with me as a young lesbian high school teacher, wanting to be \nsupportive of the LGBTQ kids that were in school. In terms of specifically advocating for \ntrans and gender conforming students, like so many things, when you know somebody it \njust changes your perspective and your ability to really understand. \nMotivation & Inspiration to Advocate \n Helen began her career as an educator with the belief that she must model authenticity \nand openness for all of her students, but particularly for those students who may have LGBTQ \nidentities. She says that her choice to be visible is in and of itself an act of advocacy. That she is \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 203 \n \nadvocating for movement away from heteronormative curriculum and social mores by allowing \nthese students to see her as a successful happy LGBTQ person: \nWe all just want to be ourselves, and see ourselves in the world around us, and a teacher \nis a profound way to see yourself – to have yourself reflected in a positive way.  \n Helen describes witnessing non-binary youth live their truth as “powerful” and inspiring. \nShe seems to find motivation for her advocacy work in these young people’s ability to challenge \nthe culturally prescribed gender binary:  \nI think this idea of being non-binary and totally rejecting the gender binary is so \npowerful. That’s one of the things I want to say to the young people that are doing that - \nhow much I love what they are doing. I see those young people as being at the forefront \nof the idea that gender has become a different thing in our culture. I mean it is an \nimportant thing, I don’t think we can get rid of it, and maybe we don’t want to get rid of \nit because it’s part of some other meaning that happens for humans. I love that some of \nthem are so brave in saying. “I’m not buying into any of that. I don’t want to have \nanything to do with any of that. Don’t even make me choose a gender. Why are you \nmaking me?”. That is something that gives me a lot of joy and hope. It’s just seeing them \nbeing and really changing things. Being a part of changing that part of our culture. \nBecoming an Advocate: “That galvanized me in a certain way” \n As she explored the intersection between her identity as an advocate, LGBTQ community \nmember, and educator, Helen attended the national “Creating Change” conference. She says that \nit was at this “LGBTQ conference” that she experienced “one of those moments in your life that \nchanges you”: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 204 \n \n[The Creating Change conference] is pretty much on the radical end of the LGBT rights. \nThey have different tracks and there was a trans track, and the trans people at the \nconference just totally took over and disrupted the keynote in a really profound \nexpression of their need to be heard and seen and supported. This was really a profound \nmoment for me, because this was not in my wheel house. I would say that probably \ngalvanized me in a certain way.  \nThe conference task force is pretty much on the left edge of the movement, and I have to \nhand it to the conference organizers, because they let it go. Nobody tried to harass people \nor say “you can’t do that”. It was kind of like “OK!” and they took the stage, they took \nthe stage and nobody stopped them. In fact, the audience actually cheered. It was just one \nof those moments. \n The transgender community’s act of taking the stage at the Creating Change conference \nseemed to demonstrate this portion of the LGBTQ community’s lack of voice, and need to be \nheard. Helen experienced this demonstration as life changing in that it showed her a division \nwithin her community of which she was previously unaware. She also describes this experience \nas evidence of the need for people to step up and be visible, to make their voices heard, and \ndemand change. \nTransgender is the New Gay \n In providing the historical background that preceded her experience at the Creating \nChange conference, Helen describes how the transgender community has historically been \ndismissed by the gay and lesbian communities. She then makes the case that today’s transgender \ncommunity is mistreated and oppressed in a way that parallels the treatment of the gay \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 205 \n \ncommunity in previous decades. Helen seems driven by her empathy for the experience of the \ntransgender community today in the quote below: \nI mean one of my arguments, especially for somebody my age who’s a lesbian or an older \ngay man, is “Do you remember what they said about us? Do you remember how they said \nthat we were sick, and that we didn’t know what we wanted? That we were mentally ill? \nDo you remember all that? It’s the same thing, it’s just 30 years later, and the transgender \ncommunity is a new group of people. They’re oppressed because they’re not acting \nexactly the way the culture says they should. Now they’re being targeted. It’s the same as \nwhen we wanted to love who we loved and not have anybody tell us that there’s \nsomething wrong with it”. We knew, I knew in my core that there was nothing wrong \nwith it, and they do too. \nSociopolitical Context & the School Environment \nHeteronormativity in the School Environment \n The parallels drawn between the treatment of the gay and lesbian community during the \npast few decades, and the treatment of transgender persons today highlights the importance of \nunderstanding the sociopolitical context of LGBTQ issues. Helen describes the school \nenvironment as steeped in “heteronormative” social and political norms. From prom to sports, \nthe public education system is heavily gendered and acknowledges only the male/female gender \nbinary. Per Helen, schools need to show young people that “there is another way to be in the \nworld”: \nSchool is so heteronormative. Of course, I didn’t even know what that word was in 1982, \nbut from the git go I was super shocked every day at how prom and everything that \nhappened in the school environment was so gender-based. I have always been looking for \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 206 \n \nways for kids to get the message that there is another way to be in the world and that \nthere’s nothing wrong with it.  \n Helen describes her advocacy work within the schools as aiming to show students that \nthere is another way of being, one that does not prescribe to the male-female gender binary. She \nviews herself as a “troublemaker”, as she consistently challenges the school administration’s \nreinforcement of black and white gender roles through the support of activities such as \n“powderpuff” football.  \nLGBTQ Discrimination \n Helen reports that school administration often fail to hold both students and staff \naccountable for discriminatory acts and statements made towards LGBTQ community members. \nShe describes instances where she was called a “faggot” and other offensive slurs during class \nsessions by students. Regarding one specific instance, Helen says, “In the middle of class he \nscreamed it out. And he received zero punishment. He got moved to another teacher’s class. That \nwas it”.  \n During the interview, Helen seemed to use humor to deflect her emotional experience \nrelated to these overt experiences of hate and discrimination. When describing another instance, \nHelen stated: \nOne of the funniest things that ever happened was during the second or third year I \ntaught. A kid wrote on one of the desks, in really angry scroll, “[Helen] is a lesbian”. And \nin that angry scroll “Bitch doesn’t shave her legs.” It was like, I don’t care if she is \nlesbian, but if she doesn’t shave her legs that’s what’s really buggin’ me. \n As an advocate who values visibility as a means of showing her students that LGBTQ \nidentities are valid and valued, Helen seems to have paid a high price for her efforts. She \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 207 \n \ndescribes experiences where she was subjected to public hate speech, and even evaluated \nnegatively on a professional level for allowing discussion of LGBTQ identities in class. The \nschool context appears to present a unique challenge to advocates like Helen, as the environment \nremains entrenched in heteronormative expectations, with administrators and staff frequently \nworking to censor any deviations from the heterosexual “norm” and male/female gender binary.  \nAffirming LGBTQ Identity in the School Environment \n Helen points out that students typically spend more time at school than they do with their \nfamilies, thus experiencing school as a safe and affirming learning environment is critical to their \ngrowth and development. She states that school personnel ought to be required to cultivate this \nsafe and affirming environment, which includes honoring the identities of their students. \nTeachers who fail to acknowledge a child’s gender pronouns and stated name should “not be \nable to keep their job”. Similar to helping professionals, school personnel should leave their \npersonal beliefs and preferences at the door when they enter the school. School administrators \nmust model affirming respectful behavior, and consistently require this of their staff: \nThere has to be a consistent message of, “You can think whatever you want about people \nwho are not of the same religion you are, or who don’t believe, or don’t have the same \nvalues as you. You can think whatever you want, but the minute you enter school \ngrounds you have to put all of that aside”. And I think a lot of people don’t get that or are \nnot willing to take that position, or to set the boundary so clearly that if this isn’t for you \nthen maybe you shouldn’t be a teacher. \n Helen provides an example of a school known for it’s affirming progressive culture, and \noutlines their positive policies and practices. Helen states that the school provides a non-\nheteronormative space, as diversity of sexual and affectual orientation and gender identity are \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 208 \n \nmet with “joyous support”. In the excerpt below, Helen describes how teachers and staff \nperpetuate the school’s diversity affirming culture, and how students experience it: \n[A local school] is just this incredible place where the school culture is such that students \ncall teachers out if they’re not using the right pronouns and if they’re being inappropriate. \n[At this school] everybody’s about everybody, and almost everybody is onboard. Most of \nthem are onboard with supporting LGBT students and each other. And what does that \nfeel like for the students? They had a panel of their students and they were talking about \nhow incredible it was for them. One particular thing a student talked about was how they \nthought that it’s really obvious that teachers considered their own sexual orientation and \nidentity in a much more open way, and that allowed folks to think things that they would \nhave never thought about in a different environment. Just because it was so ok to do that.  \nNational Level Political Context: Influence on Transgender and Gender-Expansive Youth \n Although the majority of Helen’s statements focused upon the experience of transgender \nand gender-expansive youth in the school environment, she also spoke to the influence of \nnational and state level politics. Helen describes how “that national noise is not unimportant, it \ndoes damage”. She says that New Mexico is an “oasis” compared to some states, as the state has \n“some really vocal advocates”. She also described how some “older” LGBTQ community \nmembers have had the life experience necessary to see the cyclical nature of politics, but that \nLGBTQ youth may experience discriminatory policy or political statements as more \ndisheartening:  \nSome of us who are older may have the resiliency to say, “Well that’s their problem” but \nwhen you’re sixteen I think that’s harder. The Trump administration is not supporting the \ntransgender student rights guidance that Obama had originally supported, and is taking \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 209 \n \nthe LGBT question off of the Older American survey, which is part of the way that \nmoney is allocated.  \nActs of Advocacy \nCollaborating with Other Advocates \n No matter the influence of political events or attitudes, advocates such as Helen have the \nability to pursue change through collaboration with other advocates. Helen describes working \nwith an advocate from a school district and non-profit agencies that serve the transgender and \ngender-expansive community to help create a best practices to support students who are \ntransgender or gender-expansive. These “best practices” evolved into the affirming school \npolicies and gender support plan, and establishment of the Safe Zone program within the local \nschool district. Helen describes how this collaboration in advocacy resulted in the development \nof policy: \nI have always been connected to [an advocate] at [a local school district], and there was \nthis effort to try to work with [the school district] to make a recommendation of best \npractices. So I was working with [the advocate from the school district] and [the director \nof a local non-profit agency] and we were all trying to learn how to move that forward. \nSo, advocating on a policy level, all of that was kind of happening in some ways at the \nsame time. I don’t remember what year Safe Zone started, but we gave this idea a little \nbit of structure, this idea that we need a program at school for LGBT kids to identify as \nsafe and supportive, and get the word out to them and decide how we would support \nthem. So, I worked on that from the git go and I had a job after a while where I was not a \nclassroom teacher anymore, I had a lot of freedom at that time, and [the advocate from \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 210 \n \nthe school district] was my boss. She would happen to let me, as long as I was getting my \njob done, do things on behalf of the LGBT students.  \nStrategy: Talking Points for School Personnel \n While collaborating with the advocate from the local school district and the director of a \nlocal non-profit agency, Helen identified an unmet need for training with school administration. \nHelen stated that she realized that school principals were being caught off guard when they \nreceived calls from parents asking about transgender or gender-expansive students. She then \ndiscussed this area of need with the advocates, and co-created a training concerning “talking \npoints” for school principals. These talking points provided principals with informed responses \nfor parents or community members who contacted the school with questions or comments about \ntransgender and gender-expansive students. Per Helen: \nOne of the things that [the advocate from the school district] and I were talking about was \nif we give principals the right talk, they do much better at ensuring teachers do the right \nthing because they don’t get caught off guard by a parent calling and asking questions \nwhen they don’t know what to say.  \n The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) (2016) Schools in Transition: A Guide for \nSupporting Transgender Students in K-12 Schools provides one example of “talking points” for \nschool personnel and administration regarding transgender and gender-expansive issues in the \nschool environment. These talking points provide pre-scripted responses to numerous possible \nquestions or negative comments. The approach taken in these talking points enables the school to \n“serve as a buffer to protect [transgender and gender-expansive] students and their families” (p. \n17), and are accessible, as they are available to the public free of charge through the HRC \nwebsite. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 211 \n \nVisibility as an LGBTQ Community Member \n In the beginning of her career as an educator, Helen says that she was not “out” about her \nidentity as lesbian. She describes being open to discussing her LGBTQ identity, but that she had \nnot yet been confronted with a situation or individual student that allowed her to speak about the \ntopic of sexual orientation. She says that her first experience meeting an LGBTQ student was \nwhen she attended a guest presentation where—during the speaker’s question and answer \nportion—a young man disclosed to the guest presenter that he was gay, and that there was no one \nat his high school who was gay:   \nI went to hear this person speak, and when she was taking questions, a young man stood \nup in the back of the room and said, “I go to ___ high school and there isn’t anybody gay \nthere.” Which is the school where I taught, so I stood up and said excitedly, “I teach at \n___ high school!”. So he was the first LGBTQ student I knew of. I didn’t have to have a \nLGBTQ kid in my school in order for me to be out [as a lesbian], but after I had this kid \nexpressing to me clearly…I especially felt like I needed to be open about it. So we started \na group and called it a support group, where we met once a week at lunch. I remember I \nwent to my principal—who I knew would not be supportive—and I didn’t ask for \npermission. I just said, “I thought you should know that I am doing this support group”. I \nknew what he could or couldn’t let me do. \n Helen describes hearing this young student’s statement and feeling compelled to inform \nthe student that she, an educator at his school, was in fact gay. She states that she felt a sense of \nobligation to “be open” about this aspect of her identity. Helen says that being visible as gay to \nher students is essential, as it provides LGBTQ students with the opportunity to see how a person \nwho is LGBTQ can be have a career, a partner, a family, that they can be successful. Helen uses \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 212 \n \nthe analogy of the “window and the mirror” to illustrate the role of the teacher providing one \nmodel of lived experience for students, and the need for curriculum that speaks to the experience \nof all students: \nI know one of the little things I have come to value over my years, an analogy that I just \nlove, is the idea of the window and the mirror. Every young person needs two things to \nhelp develop a positive self-awareness, the first is that you want to see yourself in the \ncurriculum. You need to see people like you doing things and being effective and \nimportant. The second is that you want to look out of the window and see all of the \ndifferences, that there’s all this other great stuff that isn’t you, but it’s just as good and as \ninteresting. I think if we are ever going to get to a point where education eliminates some \nof these barriers for students who aren’t white or heteronormative, then it’s going to be \nby helping students see as much of the universe, of their peers who might be different \nfrom them, as they can through the curriculum.  \n The concept of the “window and the mirror” described by Helen was originally described \nby Style (1988) in her critical analysis of the culturally one-sided curriculum taught in schools. \nStyle (1988) utilized the analogy of the window and mirror to illustrate how curriculum ought to \nreflect the experiences of all students, rather than only the white middle-class heterosexual \n“norm”.  \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n The coding of Helen’s interview transcripts resulted in the identification of three primary \ncategories. These categories described Helen’s development as an advocate, her experience and \nperspective regarding the impact of sociopolitical context within the school environment, and \nspecific acts of advocacy she engaged in. A variety of themes emerged in relation to these \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 213 \n \ncategories, to include her visibility as an LGBTQ community member, her motivation and \ninspiration to advocate for LGBTQ students, the role of sociopolitical context in the experience \nof LGBTQ students in the school environment, and how Helen utilized collaboration with other \nadvocates to produce positive changes within the school environment for LGBTQ students. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n Helen seemed to define advocacy artifacts as those resources that provide information \nabout the LGBTQ rights movement, or provide access to school specific resources (e.g. \ninformation for infusing school curriculum with LGBTQ information). Table 14 outlines the \nadvocacy artifacts recommended by Helen, to include the title, type, and a summary description \nof item from the source. \nTable 14 \nAdvocacy Artifacts - Helen \nArtifact Title  \n \nArtifact Type Summary Description from Source  \nFacebook, Twitter A tool for \ndisseminating \ninformation, and \nfor announcing \nevents to only \nLGBTQ \ncommunity \nmembers \nNone available. Helen listed Facebook and Twitter \nas social media platforms that she has found \nparticularly helpful for disseminating information \nabout events for members of the LGBTQ \ncommunity. She states that social media enables \nher to share information privately with LGBTQ \norganizations, and their members, and prevents \nevent information from becoming publicly \navailable. \n \nLana \nBackground Information \n Lana is a White nonbinary, bisexual, pansexual, primarily queer identifying individual. \nLana’s pronouns are they and them, and in addition to their marginalized sexual orientation and \ngender identity, they report experiences of oppression related to their disability. They have a \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 214 \n \nbachelors degree, and currently live below the poverty threshold making less than $20,000 per \nyear. Lana currently lives in New Mexico and works in a K-12 school setting. \n Lana’s experience as an advocate began when they were in high school, when at the age \nof 15 they helped to co-found a support group for LGBTQ youth. They describe the youth group \nas being held at a church “so that kids could tell their parents that they were going to a church \ngroup” and not “out” themselves to their parents or caregivers. Lana describes continuing to \nwork with LGBTQ youth while a senior in high school, when they became a board member of an \nLGBTQ advocacy organization. Upon graduating from high school and starting their \nundergraduate education, Lana became involved with the university’s LGBTQ organizations, \nand began volunteering as a panelist as a member of the speakers’ bureau for a local non-profit \nagency. While an advocate and activist working with these organizations, Lana says that their \nadvocacy efforts were focused on promoting the health and wellbeing of all LGBTQ youth. \n Lana describes deriving their motivation for advocacy work from their experience \ngrowing up in a household where their caregivers were affirming of their queer and non-binary \nidentity. Growing up in the late 1980s and 1990s, Lana’s refusal to conform to the gender binary \nwas embraced by their caregivers, and this affirming experience motivated them to “help make \nspaces safer for other [LGBTQ] people”. It was through their involvement with a non-profit \nentity that Lana and I became acquainted. During the recruiting phase of this study, I reached out \nto Lana and their partner, and both agreed to participate.  \nInterview Context \n The interview occurred at a small coffee shop in a residential area, near the participant’s \nresidence. We met later in the day, after Lana had gotten off of work. Lana seemed comfortable \nin the space and spoke openly about all aspects of their experience and their identity. Although \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 215 \n \nLana and I were seated out of the way, with our table against a wall, there were other patrons in \nthe coffee shop who may have been able to hear some portions of the interview. Lana stated that \nthey felt comfortable, and that despite the close quarters they felt that the space provided \nadequate privacy.  \n Throughout the interview Lana often shifted in their chair, and readjusted their arm, \nwhich was immobilized in a sling and cast. Lana explained that they had experienced a “flare \nup” related to their disability and also injured their wrist and elbow. They stated that it was this \ninjury and other disabling symptoms related to their disability that lead them to reschedule their \ninitial interview with me. I experienced a deep sense of gratitude for Lana’s willingness to \nparticipate in the interview – which lasted a total of 102 minutes – despite the pain and \ndiscomfort they were experiencing at that time. \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Through the coding process, three primary categories were identified: “Development as \nan advocate”, “acts of advocacy”, and “sociopolitical context”. Lana’s unique experience as a \nqueer, non-binary, pansexual, bisexual individual existing in an “in-between space” influenced \nthe themes that emerged from the interview data. The themes that emerged from Lana’s data \nattended to their experience as a diverse person growing up in a progressive household that was \naccepting of their identities, and their current experience living in a larger sociopolitical context \nthat is characterized by discrimination and hostile acts towards the LGBTQ community. The \nmost prevalent theme that arose in multiple categories was that of “visibility” as an advocate and \nactivist. These categories and themes are further explored in the text that follows. \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nInspiration and Motivation to Advocate \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 216 \n \nActivism and Diversity within the Family. Lana describes growing up in a “pretty political” \nfamily, and “making my first picket sign when I was eight”. They state that their family \n“definitely exists on the left”, and so were affirming of their non-binary non-heterosexual \npresentation as a youth. Regarding their upbringing, Lana states: \nMy dad's a little less left then my mom, but conversations about politics and social \ninequality and things like that have always been part of my life. My stepdad is a \nsociology professor and he came in as a refugee from Afghanistan as a kiddo. So those \nconversations exist in the household. My mom's a musician and grew up pretty poor. \nThose realities have always been part of the conversation. \n They describe their family’s openness to discuss topics such as social inequality and \npolitical climate as contributing to their motivation to advocate for disenfranchised populations. \nLana’s family’s open attitude towards gender also enabled them to express their gender in non-\nheteronormative ways. Lana describes coming out to their family as queer when they were “9 or \n10”, and that “getting into queer activism work was sort of just a very fluid segue” from their \nexperience as a child. \nOwn Identity and Experience as a Queer/Trans Youth. Having grown up as a non-binary \nyouth, Lana reports seeing a trend in the ages of young people coming out as transgender or \ngender-expansive. They state that the “age is getting lower for a lot of people and not changing \nfor other people depending on their reality”. Lana seems to attribute younger children’s ability to \ncome out about their transgender or gender-expansive identity to whether their “reality” or \nenvironment is conducive to the expression of such identities. They describe children who live in \nhouseholds where they are introduced to the diversity of LGBTQ identities and where \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 217 \n \ndifferences are celebrated as having the “reality” necessary to explore and embrace their \nidentities. \n Lana states that as a non-binary queer youth, they did not experience gender dysphoria as \nrelates to their bodily presentation. Instead, Lana says that their “transness…played a huge part \nin my experience of the world and how other people understand and interpret me”. Their \nsocialization and childhood seemed to cultivate a sense of comfortability in their body and their \nidentities, a comfortability that was challenged by society as they aged and became more \nautonomous. Lana describes how their identities contributed to their desire to help others, and \nearly involvement in advocacy efforts for LGBTQ youth. \nComing Out and Becoming an Activist. Coming out as queer and non-binary was an “easy” \nexperience for Lana because of the affirming environment in which they grew up. Lana says that \nhaving such a positive coming out experience has left them feeling that it’s their responsibility to \n“make the environment safer” for others: \nIn the grand scheme of things, I had such an easy coming out experience that I’ve always \nfelt like it's my responsibility to make the environment safer for people who it isn't safe \nfor, because I have this privilege and I’m not unsafe because of my queerness. I guess \nthat's part of what led me to activism as a youth, because I had kids in the youth group \nthat met at the church, that the reason they met in the church was so kids could tell their \nparents that they were going to a church group and not be outed. \n Lana describes their coming out experience as “privileged” and says that interacting with \nkids who were in less safe environments, who could not be open about their LGBTQ identity, \nmotivated them to pursue change for LGBTQ youth. Despite this privilege, Lana says that they \nstill experience hardship related to the “larger social climate”, but that their positive “home life” \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 218 \n \nand “friends” and “life at school” continues to inspire them to make life better for others in the \nLGBTQ community: \nThere are things about being queer that are hard, obviously, especially related to the \nlarger social climate. But my own personal social climate and my home life and friends \nand my life at school, it never felt unsafe to be who I was. And I am privileged in that. So \nI feel like because of that privilege, it's important to support my community. \nIntersections of Oppression: Visibility as Queer, Non-Binary, and Disabled. Experiencing \ndisability alongside their non-binary and queer identities, Lana says that the less visible their \ndisability and non-binary and queer identities, the greater their experience of privilege. They \nstate that as they have started taking testosterone as a medical intervention to treat their disability \nand are open to developing the secondary sex characteristics of the male gender. They state that \nas they’ve become more visibly “trans” they’ve experienced more frequent experiences of \noppression: \nI exist in so many privileged spaces that allow my queerness and transness to not actually \nbe that large of a marginalizing factor. As I’ve become more visibly Trans, that's become \nless true, and that's been an interesting experience. As my disability has gotten worse, \nthat too has changed that experience. \nActs of Advocacy \nVisibility in the School Environment \n Working within the school system, an environment steeped in heteronormativity, Lana \nsays that they choose to be visible to provide “kiddos who need those role models” with an adult \nwho shares their identity. Lana says that at this time, their visibility as a “trans” and queer adult \nis their primary form of advocacy. They state that since they’ve been out in a visible way about \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 219 \n \ntheir identity, more students have come to them asking questions about their appearance and \nidentity: \nI’ve been making more of an effort to find concise ways of answering. The question \nnormally is, “are you a boy or girl?”. My answer has been, “no, I’m not either”. \nSometimes that elicits further questions, in which case I say, “When we're not in the \nmiddle of class” or “Later on if you want to ask me some things about that you can, but \nright now it's not an appropriate time to have that conversation”. \n Students’ desire to learn more about Lana’s identity leads them to ask questions and \nengage Lana in conversation. Lana’s willingness to present with secondary sex characteristics of \nboth male and female genders, to be visibly trans/non-binary/queer, causes students to question \ntheir socially conditioned beliefs about the dichotomous nature of gender: \nI’m fine with the way that I look…It causes students to question what they know about \ngender. With the kids it generally just comes from a place of not understanding. It's just a \nplace of ignorance or discomfort with something new and I think that that's a really \nbeautiful space to have people in because it's a space where they can learn. \n Allowing children the room to question how they’ve come to understand gender gives \nthem the space necessary to learn, and be open to new ways of understanding: \nBeing Trans around kids is important because I think kids see people more easily than \nadults do. So being a non-normative person for them to see is important because then \nthey get that idea in their brain, it's there and they have it to call on. It opens their \nunderstanding of everything. \n Lana notes that working in the school system provides them with a unique opportunity \nallow their “transness” to be visible to children, in an environment where they can learn about \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 220 \n \nthese identities safely. They describe how enabling children to see their authentic queer, non-\nbinary self helps to open their minds to a new realm of understanding. \nSociopolitical Context \nHeteronormativity in the School Environment \n Most educational environments for young children reinforce the male/female gender \nbinary, as evidenced by gender segregated restrooms, locker rooms, extracurricular activities, \nand even separating children for class exercises based upon their identities as either boys or girls. \nLana initially hoped to work in the school environment as a teacher, but altered their vocational \ngoal when they recognized how “our educational system in the U.S. functions”, particularly in \nregards to reinforcing heterosexual and cisgender norms: \nI thought about becoming a teacher for a long time. I thought about becoming a teacher \nbefore I started college and decided against it because I don't support the educational \nsystem and I didn't want to spend four plus years in school learning how to function in \nthat system. I still struggle with figuring out how to make an impact and still be an \nactivist in this space. \n Lana now works as an educational assistant with children with special needs, in a school \nthat values diversity and whose staff and administration celebrate diversity. They state that this \nspace is unique as the openness to differences promotes acceptance of identities outside of the \nsocial “norm”: \nOne of the highest values in our school is that we support each other and we don't \ndiscriminate or bully folks that are different than us because our school is the school for \npeople that are different. There are still things that are hard. But I like to think that we \nexist in a space where the kids can understand trans folks better than in other spaces. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 221 \n \nVisibility & Political Context \n Lana describes the current political climate as characterized by “bigoted, harmful and \ninvalidating mentalities” about LGBTQ identities and persons with disabilities. They state that \nthey are willing to be visible in hopes that their existence may challenge the harmful mentalities \nassociated with the current political climate. Like many of the other participants, Lana makes \nindirect references to recent political events, condemning the behavior of U.S. politicians and \nthose who would support them: \nBeing more open and out and vocal feels more important now because of the political \nclimate. Me being visible is challenging bigoted, harmful and invalidating mentalities and \nnotions around queerness or transness or disability or other things that don't affect me \npersonally. Speaking up against that feels a lot more imperative now because of the \npolitical climate, \nTraversing the Binary and “In-between Spaces”  \n As a queer person, Lana states that they experience discrimination not only for failing to \nadhere to heteronormative standards, but also for their failure to align with “homonormative” \nexpectations. Lana defines homonormative standards as social expectations that LGT persons \nwill still align their identities with some aspect of the binary. In other words, if a person is gay, \nthen they are only attracted to members of the same sex, and if a person is transgender then they \nalign with either male or female binary. Queer and non-binary identities violate the \nhomonormative standard: \nThe differentiation of gay versus queer. Gay is a more homonormative in that the only \nthing that's different about us is that we like people of the same gender, and still sort of \nstriving for a heteronormative façade. I think that that’s prevalent in white spaces \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 222 \n \nespecially. I think anybody who falls outside of those very homonormative or faint \nheteronormative categories is prone to discrimination within the community. That's true \nfor Trans folks. That's true for bi and pansexual people, asexual people. I feel like the \nsame exists for nonbinary people in the Trans World, so not just trans folks with other \nLGB people, but nonbinary gender queer, agender people within the trans community \nbecause they don't fall into that binary experience. It is a similar to the kind of \ndiscrimination and exclusion we experience from the community at large. \n Lana describes their non-binary and queer identities as causing them to fall into an “in-\nbetween space”, between the male/female gender binary and hetero or homosexual binaries. \nThey say that this in-between space is not reflected in mainstream media, and seems excluded by \nsociety: \nEverything in western society, in U.S. society, is thought about as having to be one or the \nother. Existing in between spaces is tough. There's definitely no, no media representation. \nMere representation of gender non-normativity is still very gendered. It's still very, well, \nthat trans man is still a woman. It's still talked about in such a black and white way. Very \nmuch that pink or blue. It's a conversation that happens often in the non-binary \ncommunity, especially that just existing and having a normal life is a radical act because \nthat's such a hard thing to do. \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Within the categories of “development as an advocate”, themes emerged regarding \nLana’s motivation and inspiration for advocacy efforts, to include: “Activism and diversity \nwithin the family”, “individual experience as a queer/transgender youth”, and “coming out and \nbecome an activist”. The primary theme within the category of “acts of advocacy” was “visibility \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 223 \n \nwithin the school environment”. The final category “sociopolitical context” contained themes \nregarding heteronormativity, homonormativity, “visibility and the political context”, and \n“traversing the binary and in-between spaces”. These themes reflect Lana’s experience as an \nindividual who fails to align with any of society’s prescribed binary systems, and whose \nexperience within an accepting family system and school/workplace environment have inspired \nthem to advocate for LGBTQ youth. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n When asked about advocacy artifacts they would recommend, Lana spoke primarily of \nmemoirs of transgender and queer individuals. They seemed to define advocacy artifacts as those \ntext-based resources that provide one with an intimate understanding of an individual’s lived \nexperience as a transgender or queer person. Lana recommended a variety of memoirs as \nadvocacy artifacts. Table 15 outlines the advocacy artifacts recommended by Lana, to include \nthe title, type, and a summary description of item from the source. \nTable 15 \nAdvocacy Artifacts - Lana \nArtifact Title  Artifact Type Summary Description from Source  \nMegan Speciale PhD  Author of \nscholarly works \nregarding \nLGBTQ issues \nSee Dr. Speciale’s publications for more \ninformation. \nBorn Both:An Intersex \nLife  by Hida Viloria \nMemoir “Born Both: An Intersex Life (Hatchette Books, \nMarch, 2017), is a candid, provocative, and eye-\nopening memoir of life, love, and gender identity \nas an intact intersex person, as well as a call to \naction for justice for intersex people” (Hida \nViloria, 2019). \n \nGavin \nBackground Information  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 224 \n \n Gavin is a white, queer, “transgender/non-binary/gender fluid” individual in their early \n20s whose pronouns are they and them. They completed high school and vocational school, and \nreport an annual income of less than $20,000. Gavin resides in New Mexico, and currently \nengages in advocacy efforts with a non-profit agency serving transgender and gender-expansive \nindividuals. They report moving often as a child, as their mother was a serviceperson in the \nmilitary. When Gavin was 16, their mother passed away and they were forced to learn how to \nsupport themselves.  \n As a teenager, Gavin became involved with the speakers bureau through a national \nLGBTQ organization, where they participated in outreach and educational efforts aimed at \nincreasing awareness and understanding of LGBTQ issues. Gavin moved to New Mexico two \nyears ago, and immediately became involved with a non-profit agency. At this agency, Gavin has \nhelped to facilitate transgender and gender-expansive youth support groups, and assisted with \npresentations and panel discussions regarding gender identity. I became acquainted with Gavin \nthrough a support group, as I attend this group with my daughter. Shortly after the start of this \nstudy, I participated in a panel discussion with Gavin, and asked after the panel whether they \nwould be willing to participate in an interview. Gavin readily agreed to participate. \nInterview Context \n The interview occurred at a small coffee shop near the participant’s residence. Gavin and \nI were able to locate a table in a room separated from the main seating area that was quiet, where \nno other patrons were sitting. Gavin indicated that the location adequately attended to their need \nfor privacy, and seemed open to discussing all topics discussed in the interview questions. They \ncompleted the demographic survey, and provided the titles of a number of advocacy artifacts. \nGavin and I completed the interview in 98 minutes. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 225 \n \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Through the coding process, a number of themes related to their experience as an \nadvocate, and their awareness of the needs of the transgender and gender-expansive community \nemerged. The emergent themes seemed to fit the primary categories of “journey and professional \ndevelopment as an advocate”, “acts of advocacy”, and “sociopolitical climate”. The role of \nvisibility of transgender and gender-expansive individuals in the media was pertinent within \nmultiple categories, as Gavin viewed visibility as an essential element of their advocacy, and \nnecessary to achieving change “at large”. The themes derived from Gavin’s data are described \nbelow. \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nComing Out \n Gavin describes growing up in an environment that was supportive of their gender \nfluidity and did not enforce adherence to stereotypical gender norms. They speak to this \nexperience as allowing them to express themselves uncensored:   \nI remember as a kiddo in elementary school, I chopped all my hair off before I even \nstarted school. I chopped it off at age 3 in the backyard. I had a younger brother and I \nstarted snagging all of his clothes. So my mom just bought me boys clothes, and kept my \nhair short. \nMotivation and Inspiration to Advocate. Although Gavin came out as queer and gender-\nfluid/non-binary/transgender as a child, they state that it was not until high school that they \ntransitioned out of the “safe little bubble” of self-preservation. Gavin describes becoming an \nagent of change while in high school, as they began leading a support group for LGBTQ youth \nand acting as a member of these youth’s support system: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 226 \n \nI think that there's a tendency, especially when first coming out to dive into this little safe \nbubble where I can have my feelings and not have to deal with anyone else's. Then in my \nsenior year when I was graduating high school, that’s when I started to lead the support \ngroups and providing that kind of support to the other youth, and I was starting to feel \nlike I could do that role a little more.  \n As Gavin moved outside of the “bubble” of being out but inactive in supporting other \nLGBTQ persons, they became more involved with support efforts for LGBTQ youth in their \nschool. It was around this time that they also became involved in tabling and fundraisers for an \nLGBTQ organization: \nI started to participate in tabling and would help with fundraisers to make sure that the \norganization was there and doing that kind of outreach. I started to go to board meetings \nand figuring out the policies and what they need to make their work inclusive. Then I was \nhired as a member of their speaker's bureau. I think it's nice to have that safe little bubble, \nbut at some point you realize change doesn't really happen from everyone staying in their \nsafe little bubbles. \n Gavin emphasizes how their experience coming out was a process, as they initially \nexisted in a “safe little bubble”, then recognized that creating positive change required them \nengage in work outside of themselves. They seemed to find motivation to engage in advocacy \nefforts for LGBTQ youth in their desire to create safer spaces. This desire to see others benefit \nfrom their work is evident in their discussion of how they’ve witnessed the evolution in people’s \ncoming out narratives, from people who are now in their 50s, 30s, and 20s, and the experience of \nchildren like my daughter Zelda (age 9) or Amber, another transgender/gender-expansive support \ngroup member who is 5 years old: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 227 \n \nI think about people who are in their 50s who attended support group meetings and heard \nabout how change wasn't possible, but they're doing this work. As a youth myself, when I \ngo places and to support groups and see 30 year old and 20 year old trans folks and hear \ntheir story, or hear about what Zelda’s coming out looked like, or when I get to go to \nyouth groups and see what they're going through – that's beautiful. Just to see little \nAmber transitioning, getting all of that already done at such a young age, it's beautiful. \nIt's just, it's so amazing. And I think that's why you come out of that bubble and do that \nwork because you realize that the only way that was as easy for you to do all of this was \nbecause other people came out of their bubble and did it for you. \n Today’s LGBTQ youth are able to come out and experience support and safe spaces \nbecause previous generations were willing to come out, to be visible as an LGBTQ person within \nsociety, and pursue positive change for proceeding generations. Gavin expresses their \nappreciation of previous generations willingness to make these sacrifices, and articulates their \nhope that today’s LGBTQ youth will continue to advocate for change for future generations: \nI’m going to go make those changes, so that people Zelda's age can make changes for \neveryone in the generations after them. That's really the beauty of youth advocating, it’s \nthat you can see relatively easily how quickly changes happen. \nThe Cost of “being out as a trans person”. Existing as an openly out transgender/non-\nbinary/gender fluid individual has a cost. Gavin states that by being openly transgender, one \nmust “justify their existence constantly”. This justification of one’s existence includes “deal[ing] \nwith” the “emotional stuff” of cisgender individuals who lack understanding of the spectrum of \ngender identities. Gavin says that they are often called upon by these individuals to answer their \n“random questions”, and listen to their “life story”, as though they are a “walking PBS special”: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 228 \n \nI feel like everyone who's trans is expected to—is supposed to—justify their existence \nconstantly. At any point in time, you're supposed to educate anyone who has any random \nquestion, and then you're supposed to deal with all of their emotional stuff. Like, “Oh, I \ncan't handle this”, or “Oh, my niece is also going through this”. Let me tell you all about \nmy other life story. I feel like “Okay, that's great. I'm glad that you have a cousin that's \ngay, but that doesn't really mean anything to me”. But I think that that's part of saying \nthat you're trans and being out as trans. You automatically have to do all of that. It’s \nimportant to have resources to send people to, so you don’t have to do that constantly. It \nmakes it a little easier to just be a resource center as opposed to a walking PBS [Public \nBroadcast System] special. \n Gavin indicates that having resources they can refer these curious individuals to is of \nparamount importance, as it allows them to redirect these questions to another source. Having the \nability to redirect these individuals to another source of information allows LGBTQ community \nmembers to avoid being coerced into the role of educator because of the LGBTQ identity. Gavin \nseems frustrated by the social expectation that LGBTQ individuals must fulfill the role of \neducator for all of society but describes being willing to be visibly “out” as transgender, and \nredirect curious individuals to the appropriate resources to learn more about the LGBTQ \ncommunity. \n Despite their current willingness to help educate the general public about transgender and \ngender-expansive identities, Gavin states that they did not always feel this way. After their \nmother passed away, Gavin states that they did not want and were not able to sacrifice the \nemotional energy necessary to humor the questions of strangers, and “justify their existence”: \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 229 \n \nI was going through a lot of emotional turmoil on my own. My mom had passed, and the \ngrief of that and trying to figure out how to graduate high school…for the first couple of \nyears I was very hardcore, like, “Nope, I don't want to educate anyone. I don't want to \nhave to do this work. It's not my job. I'm just going to go do support groups all the time \nand talk to others”. My solution was that I was never going to hang out with straight cis-\npeople ever again. That I would create a bubble where I wouldn’t have to educate anyone \nbecause everyone who I'm hanging around knows what I'm going through.  \n The idea that being open about one’s identity comes with a social obligation to educate \nothers is one of many forms of oppression perpetrated by the cis-heteronormative patriarchal \nsystem that dominates American culture. So often the social dynamic that plays out when an \nLGBTQ person is called upon to act as educator for less knowledgeable others is one of social \ndominance. Per Hundleby (2013) the belief that persons should respond to “discursive hostility” \nand “aggressive emotionality” with “politeness” “reinforces gendered (and perhaps unjustified \nforms of) social dominance” (p. 239).  \n Hundleby (2013) describes situations in which an individual of minority status is asked to \ndiscuss a topic about which the other more privileged party is argumentative or has opposing \nviews. They state that the power differential between the two, coupled with the social \nexpectation that the person of minority status ought to respond with “politeness”, acts to \nreinforce the dominance of the more privileged party. Gavin’s narrative provides an example of \nhow the expectation that transgender/gender-expansive persons ought to politely answer all \nquestions and listen to strangers stories of family members who may or may not be LGBTQ, is \nrequired unpaid emotional labor that reinforces the dominance of the cisgender heterosexual \nculture. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 230 \n \nActivism: “Turning outness into your job”. Even LGBTQ community members who chose a \ncareer path in activism, a job that requires their “being out”, report exhaustion and emotional \noverwhelm. This exhaustion is attributed to traumatic experiences of discrimination and constant \nharassment by persons who behave in openly hateful towards LGBTQ persons. Being out about \none’s identity can in and of itself be an act of act advocacy, but as Gavin points out “turning \noutness into your job” can come at a price: \nSome people turn their outness into their job. I know a lot of nonbinary folks who \nprofessionally do that, but that means their entire career is being out and being an activist \nand constantly talking about how traumatic experiences of discrimination. I have friends \nwho their job is their gender. I hear about how exhausting it is from them on their social \nmedia. Like “I got spit on again today and told I was a freak again”. But they say they’re \ngoing to keep doing advocacy because it makes a difference. At this point I think this is \nthe biggest kind of trans youth advocacy work, especially in the current political climate \nthat is trying to rollback so many protections around safety, jobs, bathrooms and safety in \nschools. \n Per Gavin, being out as part of one’s career means being constantly visible as an LGBTQ \ncommunity member, and thus more vulnerable to harassment from hateful groups/individuals. \nWhen one’s career includes being open about this aspect of their identity, it both increases one’s \nvulnerability and ensures no reprieve from questions and comments from others. Although this \nwork is taxing, Gavin describes this advocacy work as impactful and important for transgender \nand gender-expansive youth. They state that being out as a transgender/gender-expansive activist \nchallenges the current political climate. \nMotivation and Inspiration to Advocate for Transgender and Gender-Expansive Youth \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 231 \n \n While attending a high school in the western U.S., Gavin participated in an LGBTQ high \nschool support group. They describe this group as introducing them to the concept of pronouns \nand providing them a space to “unload” and “create a community”. Gavin reflects on the \ndifference between their experience in high school, being introduced to the concept of gender \nidentity and LGBTQ issues, and the experience of today’s elementary school age youth who are \nintroduced to these ideas at a much earlier age. Per Gavin, it’s this shift, a shift that allows \nelementary age children to have the “conversation” about gender identity that inspires them to \nadvocate: \nThere was an organization [in high school] that went into schools once a week and \nbrought pizza. They had two folks from their organization and they just held space in one \nof the classrooms, a support group space that was led by the high schoolers. All of the \ngay or queer or trans high schoolers would go and hang out there once a week and talk \nabout what's going on in life and get to unload and create this little community space. \nAnd they always opened their groups with name and pronouns. I remember the first time \ngoing in and having to have someone explain pronouns to me. I hadn't heard of pronouns \nbefore. To realize that that was not the conversation until I hit high school, when that is a \nconversation that elementary schoolers are already getting to have, it's incredible. That's \nreally why I got into youth advocacy is because I want them to have that experience. You \nwant them to get to be them as soon as possible. \nActs of Advocacy \nVisibility of Transgender and Gender-Expansive Persons  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 232 \n \n When transgender and gender-expansive youth see transgender and gender-expansive \nadults living successful fulfilling lives, it assures them that “I can do that”. Gavin describes the \nimportance of youth seeing adults who share their identity in their community and in the media: \nI think as a Trans person when you see yourself represented, it's that like, “Oh cool. I can \ngo do that. That opportunity exists for me, I can do that. There are other people like me”. \nAnd I feel like for cis people it also would be like, “Oh, these trans people do exist”, and \nhaving this way of relating to them through media. \n Gavin speaks to the visibility of transgender and gender-expansive individuals as also \ninfluencing the perspectives of cisgender persons by showing that “these trans people do exist”. \nReferencing their own coming out experience, Gavin says that having LGBTQ media \nrepresentation provide persons who are in the process of coming out with a third party to \nreference to educate family and friends. Using their own coming out as an example, Gavin says \nthat they “put a documentary on the tv” about LGBTQ identity, then watched the reaction of \nfamily members. They reported using their family members reaction to the documentary to \ngauge whether or not they could safely come out to these individuals about their queer and \ngender fluid/non-binary-transgender identities: \nThat's what I did with a lot of my family as I was slowly coming out, because after my \nmom passed away I had a lot of family move in that were extended relatives who had \nonly met me once or twice and were super Christian, super conservative. So I would put a \ndocumentary on the TV and they'd say, “Oh I guess this is what's on. I guess we're going \nto watch this”. And that gave me a third person to have that conversation with them, so I \ndidn't have to. Being able to say like, “Oh, my experience is like this, go watch it”. It's \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 233 \n \nnice and it makes it a lot less work for me to explain my experience and I feel like there’s \ndistance between the viewer and movie.  \n Gavin says that providing their family members with media representations of LGBTQ \npersons’ experiences gave them “the chance to step away from the personal and figure out their \nown feelings”. They say that being able to view these experiences via the media provides people \nwith the distance necessary to “figure out their own feelings” and “process that on their own \ntime”. Gavin describes the role of this process in family member’s reaction towards their \nLGBTQ loved one as allowing them the space to explore their feelings, to learn more about \nLGBTQ identities without burdening their loved one with awkward questions and/or comments, \nand to help them support their loved one as they come out about their identity. \nFacilitating Outreach & Education \n As a teenager living in the western U.S., Gavin was afforded the opportunity to work \nwith multiple LGBTQ youth advocacy groups. Their role was to help facilitate a support group \nfor LGBTQ youth under the age of 21. They also participated in the speaker’s bureau, going to \ncommunity organizations and providing trainings regarding gender diverse identities. These \ntrainings would last about 2 hours, and cover a variety of issues, from LGBTQ concerns to \nracism, and the intersection of oppressed identities. Per Gavin: \nWhen I was in in the eastern U.S. I helped run a 21 and under support group and I was on \ntheir speaker's bureau. What I did was similar to how [other non-profits] go out and give \n[gender diversity] trainings to community places like churches or different organizations \nor schools that ask for someone to come do a training. The speaker's bureau and the \norganization I was with, they would have community members or organizations request a \ntraining. So we would put together presentations based on the needs of the group we were \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 234 \n \neducating and what was the subject matter they specifically asked us to talk about and \nhow they intersect. \nMentoring Other Youth \n Participating in support groups for transgender and gender-expansive youth, Gavin states \nthat they often shared about their experience losing their mother at such a young age. They \ndisclose how losing their parent left them in a position where they needed to work and obtain \nhousing, and so were confronted with those laws and “boundaries” that—although originally \ncreated to protect youth—put them at a disadvantage when trying to meet their own needs: \nOne of the things I often shared was I lost my mom when I was really young. I talk about \nhow that shaped my experience with housing and working. Just being so young and \ntrying to face all those boundaries. I was lucky I was on the working end of 16 because \notherwise I would not have been able to work. Laws and boundaries around the working \nage are there to help, but sometimes they make it complicated for youth. Laws around \nhealthcare and consent are there to help, but sometimes they can make it complicated. \n Gavin’s use of self-disclosure when interacting with LGBTQ youth enables them to build \nrapport, and to relate their experience of having “the system work against you” to the experience \nof other group members: \nIt was helpful for people to hear those actual examples of how the system works against \nyou looks on a functional level, and connect with people so that it's not so mysterious.  \nVisibility as a Means of Humanizing the Transgender and Gender-Expansive Community \n Gavin speaks of their visibility, and the visibility of all transgender and gender-expansive \ncommunity members as an act of advocacy. They describe how the visibility of trans people in \nthe community and the media helps on a macro-level by humanizing their existence. They state \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 235 \n \nthat this leads to “dismantling harm at large”, as society recognizes the existence of the trans \ncommunity and sees them as members of society: \nHow important it is for people to actually see trans actors existing and playing roles and \nhow that helps to dismantle harm at large towards the community, and how it can bring \nthe murder rates down, and help humanize us, because most people think they've never \nmet a trans person. So when they get to see them represented in the media, it’s such an \nimportant thing. That also gives opportunity and jobs to trans actors who don't have a lot \nof roles. That speaks to a lot of my experience in trying to educate. I often share that I am \na person who's affected by this, this is a personal thing for me. \n Gavin further describes how transgender and gender-expansive individuals’ visibility is \nan act of advocacy, explaining how visibility shows that a person can be LGBTQ and be \nsuccessful: \nThe biggest thing you can do as an activist is to use the bathroom that goes with your \ngender, get a job and be out as nonbinary, and actually exist in the world as a nonbinary \nperson and prove that it can be done and that you can exist and you can make enough \nmoney and you can live this beautiful, happy life.  \n The visibility of transgender and gender-expansive persons also introduces children to \ngender identities outside of the male/female gender binary. Enabling children to see persons \nliving outside the binary causes them to ask questions about gendered existence. Gavin shares \nthat visibility is essential to encouraging children to question gender norms, and “have those \nconversations”: \nBeing visible and therefore getting asked those questions by kids and getting to have \nthose conversations is essential. That way, by the time they're in elementary school, if \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 236 \n \nthey see someone who looks different, they’ve already had that conversation, they \nalready have that language. \nAdvocacy as Promoting Access to Resources \n On an individual level, Gavin describes advocacy as providing transgender and gender-\nexpansive people with the resources necessary to meet unmet needs. These resources include \nphysical resources such as needle exchange and housing, as well as mental health and healthcare \nresources such as counseling, support groups, and information about affirming and safe medical \npractitioners: \nSome advocacy is more through trying to either create nonprofits that can offer support \nservices like the [local non-profit agency] that offers the needle exchange, counseling, \nlegal help, support groups, and that offer a list of medical practitioners that are safe. \nThat's kind of where most of the advocacy is happening at this point for a lot of the trans \ncommunity. It’s in recognizing that our community struggles with suicide at a higher rate, \nwith about 48 percent this year of trans folks attempting to commit suicide. Compared to \nlike 14 percent of the general population, that's ridiculous. So creating support systems \nand support groups and trying to get support groups as accessible to folks as possible to \nmeet the need for support. Like a fourth of the homeless youth population is LGBTQ \nchildren. We need to make sure that there are shelters and housing options that aren't \ngender restricting. \n Gavin cites the suicide rate and number of LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness as \nevidence supporting the need for increased resources for this population. Their description of the \nstruggles of this population, and specific unmet needs, speaks to the need for advocacy efforts to \nincrease access to resources. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 237 \n \nSociopolitical Context \nBuilding a Life in an Oppressive Sociopolitical Climate \n Throughout the interview, Gavin reflected on their personal experiences of discrimination \nand the stories of oppression shared by other transgender and gender-expansive community \nmembers. Gavin describes how having a gender identity that fails to align with the prescribed \ngender binary can impact every aspect of one’s lived experience. They state that it is particularly \ndifficult to come out as non-binary or gender non-conforming, as the social and political systems \nin the U.S. do not acknowledge this reality: \nThere are so many struggles in life, right? Like what career am I going to choose? Where \ndo I want to live? How involved in politics do I want to be or not be? What do I want my \nregular life to look like? Imagine that after you figure all of that out, you figure out that \nyour gender is different. It’s like “Oh wait, this changes everything”, “What I can do as a \nprofession, because which professions are going to accept my gender?”, “Is it real for me \nto think that I can go be a teacher if I'm not cisgender?”, “Is it real for me to think that I \ncan navigate any kind of system that I need to as part of my job as a lawyer?”, “Would I \nbe called miss or sir? But neither of those fit”, “Is it realistic for me to want into this \njob?”. You have those kinds of realizations at high school or college age when you're \nalready mostly geared towards a path. You think, I can’t actually do this because I'm not \ncis, because I am gender nonconforming, because I don't fit the binary. \n The social and political system’s lack of validation of gender identities outside of the \ngender binary not only alienates persons whose identity exists outside of the binary, but also \ncontributes to a system of oppression. Gavin speaks to transgender and gender-expansive \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 238 \n \nindividuals’ struggle to find places to live and work that will allow them to exist safely, and be \ntheir authentic selves:  \nThere aren't really job positions that exist where I can actually express who I am or do \nwhat I want to do. Your gender identity re-gears your entire life. It’s like, “Oh, I'm Trans. \nCan I still live in my hometown? Is it still safe to live in my hometown? Do I have to \nmove? And where am I supposed to be moving to then? Where is it actually safe?”. \n Acting as an advocate pursuing positive social change for transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth, Gavin describes one of their goals as reorienting social norms so that children \ncan live as their authentic selves as soon as possible. They state that the sooner a child can \npresent as their authentic gender, then the less the likelihood that they will need to reinvent their \nlives. Gavin emphasizes how challenging it is to “reinvent your entire life” when, in late \nadulthood, a transgender or gender-expansive person transitions from a cisgender presentation to \nachieve congruence between their internal experience and external appearance: \nA big piece that gets overlooked in talking about trans kids is realizing themselves as \nearly as possible so that they're not reinventing their entire life later on as an adult. You \nhear about people married to straight partners, with kids, who in their forties and fifties \nhad to come out and uproot their entire life. Doing that process at 20 is great, but to not \nhave to do that process by being able to live authentically at like four or five would, that \nwould be awesome. \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n The themes derived from Gavin’s data fell under the umbrella categories of “journey and \ndevelopment as an advocate”, “acts of advocacy”, and “sociopolitical climate”. Themes were \nbroad based, addressing Gavin’s individual experiences and their impact on their motivation to \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 239 \n \nadvocate for transgender and gender-expansive youth, to more macro-level variables such as the \ninfluence of transgender and gender-expansive community member’s visibility on the prevalence \nof suicide attempts for this population. Gavin’s interview provided incredible insight into the \nlived experience of an advocate who not only pursues change for young members of the LGBTQ \ncommunity, but whose existence and visibility as a member of the LGBTQ community \nchallenges the oppressive norms they seek to change. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n Gavin seemed to define advocacy artifacts as resources that provide a glimpse of the \nlived experience of transgender and gender-expansive community members. Table 16 outline the \nadvocacy artifacts recommended by Gavin, to include the title, type, and a summary description \nof the item from the original source. \nTable 16 \nAdvocacy Artifacts - Gavin \nArtifact Title  Artifact Type Summary Description from Source  \nThe Argonauts by \nMaggie Nelson \nMemoir “A brave, fascinating memoir about love, gender, \ngender theory, having children, death, writing, and \nthe modern family” (Google Books, 2019). \nA Queer and Pleasant \nDanger by Kate \nBornstein \nMemoir “The true story of a nice Jewish boy who joins the \nChurch of Scientology and leaves twelve years \nlater to become the lovely lady she is today” \n(Bornstein, 2013). \nLiving as a Non-Binary \nin a Binary World by \nGraysen Hall, TEDx \nUniversity of Kent \nFilm, TedTalk “A talk addressing the hardships and obstacles \nfacing the day-to-day life of those who identify \noutside of the gender binary.

After graduating with his bachelors \ndegree, Joel began working for an LGBTQ youth advocacy organization. This organization \nprovides youth across the spectrum with access to health and sex education, a safe space to share \ntheir experience and explore their identity, attend community events, and interact with \nprofessionals who aim to validate and support these young people. Joel reports a total income of \n$35,000 to $49,999 from his employment with the non-profit agency and other endeavors.  \n Growing up, Joel states that his family imparted in him the belief that gender was an \nunchangeable characteristic assigned at birth. Per Joel, his family and caregivers taught that: \nYou are your sex assigned at birth. That is permanent. That is a feature you can never \nchange, like skin color; it’s an undeniable fact. \n Joel describes this aspect of his upbringing as preventing him from exploring his gender \nidentity, even though he saw himself as “thinking like the boys do” and “having a boy brain”. \nHis experience learning about transgender identity, and coming out as “male, genderqueer” \ngreatly impacted his development as an advocate for LGBTQ youth. In his early 20s, while \nworking as a youth coordinator for the non-profit agency, Joel states that he found himself \nreflecting on his lack of a safe space as a child and adolescent. He says that his personal \nexperience informed his response to those transgender and gender-expansive youth who reached \nout to the organization, seeking support while continuing to live in a less than affirming \nenvironment: \nI knew what it was like for me when I was coming out, when I really needed a safe space \nto be myself. I knew that from my own experience that some kids families aren't as \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 241 \n \naccepting. So we started to see it too, where we would have kids message us through \nFacebook and say, “I'm not out to my family, do they have to know for me to be able to \ngo?”. And we said, “no they don’t. We're here to support you. We'll use a different name \nand pronouns with them, just let us know what we can do to keep you safe”. \n Joel’s experience as a transgender gender-queer youth and background navigating his \nfamily and community while coming out as transgender/gender-queer informed his advocacy \nefforts. The inductively derived categories and themes will further speak to the elements of \nJoel’s experience that impacted his decision to advocate for LGBTQ youth, and his approach to \nsuch efforts. \nInterview Context \n Joel and I completed the interview at a Starbucks near his work. The interview occurred \nmidday, during Joel’s lunch break. We sat at a table away from the main walk way, but near the \nbathroom, thus maintaining privacy required that we speak in somewhat hushed tones. Despite \nour location in the coffee shop, Joel stated that he felt that the space adequately attended to \nprivacy. The interview lasted a total of 55 minutes. \nInductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n Through the coding process, three major categories emerged from Joel’s data: 1) \n“Development as an advocate”, 2) “acts of advocacy”, and 3) “sociopolitical climate”. Themes \nrelated to these umbrella concepts included: Joel’s own coming out narrative as a gender queer \nperson, experiences that inspired him to become an advocate for transgender and gender-\nexpansive children, and specific resources and youth programs Joel helped to create. Emergent \nthemes also included the use of outreach and education to “create new advocates” and “develop \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 242 \n \nbetter allies”, and an ode to the strength and resiliency of transgender and gender-expansive \nyouth. \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nComing Out: A Foundation for Empathic Understanding \n Joel’s experience coming out is inextricably intertwined with his development as an \nLGBTQ youth. Throughout the interview, Joel discloses instances where his personal experience \ncoming out as transgender/gender-queer informed his understanding of the experience of the \nyouth with which he works. Initially, Joel’s exploration of his gendered self was characterized by \ncriticism – criticism of taken for granted gender norms, both as they apply to others and to \nhimself. This critical lens enabled Joel to observe his own way of perceiving the gender of others \nand adjust his perspective from immediately labeling others based on perceived secondary sex \ncharacteristics, to having an open curiosity about how others define their gendered identity. Per \nJoel, his worldview started to shift after reading a Facebook post: \nAfter I graduated college, I saw a post on Facebook from an LGBT page that said, “When \nyou look at me and you're wondering what my gender is, instead of asking yourself what \nmy gender is, ask yourself why it matters. I'm still human”. And I thought that's a really \ngood point. I like that. And then I started thinking about it, and I look at people all the \ntime. I've never looked at people and thought, I can't tell if you're a boy or a girl. I can \njust tell when I look at people if they're a boy or a girl. And then I started to actually pay \nattention to the people around me and thought, wait, there are people who are hard to tell. \nThere are indications that they could go either way, so I thought, maybe it's not as \nobvious as I thought it was. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 243 \n \n In reconsidering his assumptions about gender identity and presentation, Joel became \ncritical of his conceptualization of his own gender. He describes the moment that he started to \nquestion how his own taken-for-granted beliefs about gender impacted his ability to understand \nand express his own gender identity: \nIt suddenly started to occur to me that maybe even the people that I think are obviously \nmale or obviously female, maybe they aren't that obvious. Maybe I'm looking at them and \nmaking an assumption about them, but that's not an actual representation of who they are. \nI'm just assuming based on looking at them. Then I thought, when someone looks at me \nand assumes I’m a girl, but that doesn't mean I'm a girl. Then all of a sudden I just \nstopped and thought, “wait, am I a girl? How do I know I'm a girl? I don't even know \nwhat that means”. \n This viewing of self and other’s gendered selves differently caused Joel to discard his \nprevious black-or-white understanding of gender. His new-found ability to view the gender \nbinary from a critical perspective acted as the foundation for his ability to see how transgender \nand gender-expansive youth navigate the world. Joel began to see the challenges these youth face \nand how he as an advocate can support them in their journey. Regarding his own experience \nconsidering coming out or keeping his transgender identity private, Joel states: \nI knew what it was like for me when I was coming out, where I really needed a safe space \nto be myself. But I didn't know if I could keep my job at the time. I didn't know if I could \nkeep it if I came out as Trans. I didn't know how they were gonna react. I really didn't \nwant it out there that I was trans, and I knew that from my own experience.  \n Weighing his options, Joel considers issues of safety related to being visibly transgender, \nincluding whether coming out will mean losing his job or having to cope with other’s negative \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 244 \n \nresponses. Joel uses his own experience of fear and uncertainty as a foundation for empathic \nunderstanding of the experiences of transgender and gender-expansive youth. He explains how \nthis empathy influences his work as a youth services coordinator and advocate: \nSome kids’ families aren't as accepting. We started to see it where we would have kids \nmessage us through like Facebook and say, “I'm not out to my family, do they have to \nknow for me to be able to go to [the agency]?”. We said, “No, they don’t. We're here to \nsupport you. We'll use a different name and pronouns with them. Just let us know what \nwe can do to keep you safe, so you can still have your safe space that you can come to”. \n Joel’s personal experience helps him to empathize with the transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth who seek services from the non-profit entity. He seems to recognize the parallel \nbetween his need for a safe space as a young transgender/gender-queer person, and the needs of \nthe youth who come to the non-profit to also experience a safe space. Joel articulates concrete \nways of generating safety for this group, to include using specific pronouns and name when the \nindividual’s parents, caregivers, or family members are present, and only using the youth’s \naccurate pronouns and name when it is safe to do so and would not out the youth. Joel also \ndescribes how the non-profit includes “allies\" in its title so that kids who come to the non-profit \nwho are not out to their parents about their transgender or gender-expansive identity can justify \ntheir receiving services by telling their caregivers that they are simply supporting someone else: \nPart of our maintaining safety at the [non-profit] is that it straight up says it's for LGBTQ \nteens and allies. It says allies so we can give the kids an out if their family is not as aware \nof their gender identity, then we can say, “Oh they're just here because their friend is \nhere, and their friend needed a support person”. We'll ask them, “Does your family use \nthe same name and pronouns with you that we're using with you? Or is there another \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 245 \n \nname and pronouns we need to be aware of? That way if we interact with your parents, \nwe don't out you on accident”.  \nGender Presentation: Navigating Society’s Gender Binary. Joel explains his gender identity \nas “gender queer”, defined as a “blend” of both male and female as existing “somewhere in \nbetween”. He says that coming to understand his gendered-self meant recognizing that his \nidentity is “some other thing by itself, and that exists outside of the gender binary. With society \nconceptualizing gender as solely male or female, Joel felt that he needed to align his gender \npresentation with either stereotypically male or female characteristics. He states that he chose to \npresent as male because being labeled a female would be “a lot less accurate”: \nIf I could be seen, the rest of the world isn't at a point where they can recognize that I'm \nsome other thing by itself, that my gender is its own thing. They're going to identify me \nas either male or female and there's going to be a whole bunch of assumptions that come \nwith that depending on which one they pick. If they pick female, it's a lot less accurate \nthan if they pick male. I want people to see me as male, so I was thought screw it, I'm \ngoing to transition. \nMotivation & Inspiration to Advocate \n As a child, Joel was unaware of what it meant to have a gender other than male or female, \nor to be assigned the incorrect gender at birth. His understanding of transgender identity was that \n“there were men who liked to wear dresses and we don't talk about that”. Joel expresses his \nfrustration about being the “weird kid” growing up because he couldn’t understand why his \nexperience with gender was so different from his peers. He says that if he had had the knowledge \nand understanding, he would have transitioned earlier in life, and could have avoided the “whole \nweird awkward period of hating myself and not knowing why”.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 246 \n \n It was the adverse experience of growing up feeling like the only one, of having feelings \nthat he did not understand, that motivated Joel to pursue advocacy work. He says that this \nprocess inspired him to want to educate others about the spectrum of gender identities, that he \nmight help people who “don’t know about it”: \nI was 24 when I transitioned, it was intense. They say you're always supposed to know \nfrom a young age, but I was this weird kid who didn't know anything about it. And that \nwas really hard for me because I was like, my life would've been so much easier if I had \nany kind of knowledge about trans people when I was a kid. I probably would have \ntransitioned then. That's probably me. When I was way younger rather than going \nthrough this whole weird awkward period of hating myself and not knowing why. I think \nthat was what pushed me to advocate, because I didn't know anything about it and clearly \nthis has been around for a long time. So if I didn't know about it, how many other people \ndon't know about it? So I thought, let's take the time to teach people about what it means \nto be trans. \nActs of Advocacy \nCommunity Programming \n Prior to engaging in community-based advocacy, Joel worked a human services provider \nwith children under age 12. After leaving this position, he became involved with a community \nprogram that provides a safe space, sense of community, and resources for LGBTQ youth. With \nthis program, Joel coordinates the provision of services and runs a support for LGBTQ youth. \nJoel says that as part of this role, he also “slowly started going to conferences, educating people \nabout LGBTQ issues”. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 247 \n \nOrigins. Joel explains that the non-profit entity he works with utilizes the “empowerment \nmodel”, which was originally created by the University of California San Francisco in the mid-\n1990s. He says that the empowerment model was intended for “community level intervention for \nHIV prevention” and was implemented in communities across the country in the form of pilot \nprograms aimed at assessing the efficacy of the model. Joel describes the program in New \nMexico as the “longest continually running [non-profit] project [of it’s kind] in the world”, as the \nprogram has managed to maintain funding through various organizations. \nEducation. The community program Joel works with aims to help members of the LGBTQ \ncommunity “learn about healthier sex practices” and “learn how to do what they want to do, but \nin a safer manner”. Joel states that the organization also assists community members to “have \nhealthy relationships, learn what consent looks like”. Overall, the organization is “motivated by \nthe participants” thus activities and services change based upon the needs of the people being \nserved.  \n Joel says that one of the primary interventions offered is education, which is “slipped into \nconversations”. He describes his approach to education as including health information in \n“casual conversations…so you don’t feel like you have to go sit in a class to learn”, and states \nthat this approach applies to both his work with adolescents and children. Joel also describes \nengaging in structured education efforts: \nSometimes we have like really structured times where we sit down and learn about sexual \nhealth, but most of the time it happens when they're talking about the relationships they're \nhaving in school or conversations they have with their friends, or different \nmisconceptions people have about them. Then we bring in these conversations so we can \nsay, “let's change it”.  \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 248 \n \n Looking at education from a big picture perspective, educational interventions aim to \nchange “enough of the population’s way of thinking” so that the new view “becomes a norm \nwithin that group. And then they spread it to their friends”. Joel states that the purpose of \neducating the young community members who come to the program for services is to both assist \nthe individual, and greater society, as the effect of educational interventions go beyond the \nperson with whom you interact. Persons who receive services and educational interventions will \ngo out into the community and share what they’ve learned, creating a ripple effect and increasing \nthe impact. \nLavender Prom \n One of the major events Joel helped coordinate with the assistance of the program and \nlocal LGBTQ advocacy groups was the Lavender Prom (an event offered in numerous places \nacross the U.S.). Lavender Prom is an “LGBTQ prom” that is held once per year, for LGBTQ \nyouth ages 13 to 20. Joel describes using social media and hashtags to inform community \nmembers about the event. He says that they utilized specific hashtags so that if a community \nmember learned about the event, they could look up the hashtag to get information about the \nevent. Joel says that the reason he chose to utilize online platforms in this way was to ensure that \nthe general public did not become aware that a “gay prom” was being held, and to avoid “anti \nLGBTQ people showing up”. Joel describes the social media advertisement for Lavender Prom \nas stating: \n“Come hang out with us and it's going to be a good time. You're going to be with your \npeers who are just like you, it's going to be great. You're in a safe space, come as \nyourself. Bring whoever you want, whoever that is. We're just here to have a good time”.  \nSafe Space \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 249 \n \n With many youth living in homes that are unsupportive of their LGBTQ identity, Joel \nsays that his work focuses on providing youth with “a safe space where they can be themselves \nand have the room to explore wherever they're at and explore their identity and explore their \nsexual orientation.” He says that he and the staff at the program respect these youth as they “try \non different names and pronouns”, providing them with non-judgement, and validation. \nEven though LGBTQ youth’s access to resources is limited by their parents/caregivers because \nof their status as minors, Joel says that the one resource he can always provide is a “safe space”: \nI think the hard part is that we can't do much if they don't have their parents support, but \nwe can provide them with a space where they can at least feel like themselves sometimes \nand feel validated in their identity when they're in that space. I know I can't give them \nmuch, but that's what I can give them. \nOutreach & Education Efforts \nThe “Gay ocean” & Tapping into Personal Experience. Despite Joel’s personal experience as \na gender-queer person, he says that working with an LGBTQ advocacy organization was still \nlike being “thrown into the gay ocean”. Joel describes seeking information, doing what he could \nto learn about the LGBTQ community. He says that this experience showed him the importance \nof making education about LGBTQ identities available to the public. It was at that time that Joel \ndecided to become an educator, to use his own learning and personal experience to inform his \nefforts: \nI had no idea when I got my job that it would be like getting thrown into the gay ocean \nand told to swim. I thought, I don't know how to swim but I'll find my way back to land. \nThere was a steep learning curve. Not everybody has the advantage where they can get \nthrown into a community and learn from it. Maybe they don't have access to finding out \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 250 \n \nas many things, or they can't go look and find the information for themselves because \nthey don't even know what they're looking for. So I thought somebody has got to go and \nteach. I'll teach people and I can use my own experience to help them learn. \n When engaging in educational efforts as part of outreach, Joel says that he is usually \nteaching the staff and administration within the schools. Working with school staff, Joel provides \ninformation about “trans and gender nonconforming groups…and sexual orientation” and \nteachers “how to bring all of it into the classroom and be more inclusive”. He describes these \neducation sessions as lasting anywhere from two hours to three days, and including exploration \nof the application of information in situations these educators might encounter. Examples of the \napplication of information include: \nThis is how you make your classrooms more inclusive. This is the kind of language you \nshould be using. Let's just spread it out for you so you can see this is the difference \nbetween sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and sex assigned at birth, \nso you can see that they aren't all the same thing and that these can be really fluid. Then \nwe really hold their hands through this process by going through scenarios like “You're \nworking in a classroom and something comes up”, or “You're in the hallway and this is \nwhat's happening”, or “This is what your administration and your school are doing, and \nhow are you dealing with that?”, and “How can you be the most supportive you can be \nfor your students” and “This doesn't just affect LGBT kids, but this increases the positive \nlearning environment for all kids who are coming through your school just by being more \ninclusive of these identities”. \nOutcomes of Education & Outreach. Joel categorizes individuals who attend his trainings and \nworkshops as typically belonging to one of two categories, either 1) Individuals seeking to “be \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 251 \n \nbetter allies” and who are open to learning new concepts, or 2) “the people who want to push \nback” and may even become “combative” about the information Joel provides. Joel states that as \nan advocate, he aims to meet people where they are, and facilitate conversation around emerging \nissues. He seems to view this process as helping individuals to develop a more informed \nperspective, that hopefully enables them to see the value in providing inclusive and safe \nenvironments for transgender and gender-expansive children and youth. He defines success in \nthese advocacy efforts as when someone at the training becomes “even one degree less against \n[these youth] then when I walked in”. \nSociopolitical Climate \n For Joel, the theme of sociopolitical climate includes both positive and negative elements, \nas he notes both the strengths of transgender and gender-expansive youth, and the challenges and \nbarriers they face within greater society.  \nStrengths of Transgender and Gender-Expansive Youth \n Joel expresses his feelings of admiration towards transgender and gender-expansive \nyouth, describing them as “resilient”, and “the strongest group of people I’ve ever met”. He \nseems to view these youth as having to fight for the right to exist, as the world may not “agree” \nwith who they are. Joel’s words appear steeped in awe and appreciation, as he describes these \nyouth’s belief that “it gets better”: \nSo resilient, so, so, so resilient. Trans people are probably the strongest group of people \nI've ever met, and Trans Youth in particular. When they're like solid in their identities and \nthey say, “I know the rest of the world doesn't seem to agree with me on this, but this is \nwho I am”. It isn't easy. Sometimes they have their moments where they're just like fuck, \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 252 \n \neverything sucks, and nobody is supporting me, but they keep fighting because they \nreally do believe that it gets better. \nChallenges Associated with Gender Segregated Facilities  \n While engaging in an educational workshop for school employees, Joel was confronted \nby an individual who stated their belief that transgender and gender-expansive youth must use \nthe “nurse’s restroom” so they “don’t have to be in the restroom [or locker room] with all of the \nother kids”. During our interview, Joel seemed visibly distressed by this workshop participant’s \nstatements, stating that “They’re literally there for the same reason everybody else is…they \nliterally just want to change clothes!”. While expressing his frustration, he described how – as \npart of the training – he pointed out the inappropriate nature of “singling out” transgender and \ngender-expansive youth as though they are a safety risk to cisgender children. Joel says that the \nresponse of the person, and the entire group of attendees was characterized by the following: \nAt the end of the training, I think the person was like “I guess”, but it was still one of \nthose situations where I knew even I'm not going to change your mind. But there might \nbe other people around the room who are still thinking about it and they're like, “Huh, I \nnever thought about it that way”. Maybe I changed their minds, in which case now I've \ngot more advocates in the room, even if I didn't change that one person’s opinion. \n Joel ultimately finds the silver lining in the attendee’s staunch stance against the right of \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth to use the appropriate facilities. The silver lining is that \nother persons in the workshop who made have had similar views may now be re-evaluating their \nown beliefs. Joel indicates that the act of having critical dialogue about the sociopolitical \ncontroversy surrounding gender segregated facilities may have helped those who witnessed the \nconversation to come to a more inclusive, trans-affirming perspective. \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 253 \n \nSummary of Inductively Derived Categories & Related Themes \n The themes that emerged from Joel’s data spoke to the complexity of the social reality \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth face. These youth may feel “solid” in their gender \nidentity but have family members or caregivers who do not allow them to present as their \nauthentic selves. To complicate matters even further, these children may also have a school \nenvironment that refuses to allow them to utilize the facilities that align with their gender, or \nwhose school may not have facilities that are appropriate for their gender identity (e.g. non-\nbinary children who may benefit from having the option of being able to use gender neutral \nfacilities). The themes derived from Joel’s data speak to the ways in which his efforts aim to \noffset the hostile environment created by persons and institutions who refuse to acknowledge or \nvalidate the identities of transgender and gender-expansive youth. \nAdvocacy Artifacts \n Joel seemed to view advocacy artifacts as resources that might support someone’s efforts \nto advocate for LGBTQ youth. His recommendations appear pragmatic for advocates and/or \nallies from a variety of backgrounds. Joel recommended two advocacy artifacts, specifically the \nTransgender Resource Center of New Mexico and GLSEN. Since these artifacts were already \noutlined in previous case portraits, their description is not included here. \nCross Case Analysis and Review \n Following the comprehensive analysis of each participant, cases were compared to \nidentify general categories that apply to multiple cases/participants. As noted by Yin (1984) \ngeneralizations often exist among participants’ data, even though details are expected to be \nunique for each case. Evaluating categories and themes across cases “can establish the range of \ngenerality of a finding or explanation, and at the same time, pin down the conditions under which \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 254 \n \nthat finding will occur” (Miles and Huberman, 1984, p. 151). A meta-matrix (see Table 18) was \nutilized to illustrate the results of the cross case analysis in terms of the overarching categories, \nand emergent themes (and related subthemes, when present) (Merriam, 1988). Mental maps were \nused to illustrate the interrelationships, similarities, and distinctions between participants’ themes \n(Ryan and Bernard, 2000). \nMeta-Matrix & Mental Maps \n Reviewing the meta-matrix, three categories emerged that were referenced by all \nparticipants. These categories included: 1) “Acts of advocacy”, 2) “development as an advocate”, \nand 3) “sociopolitical context”. Each category included a variety of themes, ranging from \nspecific actions and processes, to experiences, and beliefs. These categories were utilized as the \nprimary source for examining the differences and similarities between cases/participants.  \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 255 \n \nTable 18

The center circle, illustrated \nusing a solid line, contains participant themes that generally relate to the category.

The first of \nthese commonalities or subcategories was “advocating as an educator”. Multiple participants \ndiscussed their advocacy efforts as including educational component, with advocates engaging in \nthese efforts both within, and outside of educational institutions and settings (i.e. schools, \nuniversities, training programs).  \n Acting as educators, advocates reported modeling affirming attitudes and supporting \ntransgender and gender-expansive students in the school environment. On an individual level, \nthey described collaborating with other advocates to create resources for this population within \nthe school environment. Advocates also educated school personnel about the needs of \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth and provided specific talking points for administrators \nto ensure that they have the information necessary to effectively address the questions of \nparents/caregivers regarding school policy. All transgender and gender-expansive participants \nreported being “visible” and “out” about their identities, utilizing their presence as a means of \ncommunicating to others that transgender and gender-expansive individuals can lead successful \nlives. \n The subcategory “the role of sociopolitical context” includes those themes that speak to \nacts of advocacy that are directly associated with issues of power and political influence. \nCommon themes among participants that reside under this categorical umbrella include “giving \nbigots consequences”. “Giving bigots consequences” refers to confronting individuals who make \nhateful statements about transgender and gender-expansive identities and, when safely able, \nholding them accountable for their statements. One example of this was provided by participant \nSuzanne, who reported ending her relationships with multiple family members when those \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 263 \n \nfamily members made hateful and rejecting statements about transgender and gender-expansive \nidentities.  \n Another subcategory under the primary umbrella of “acts of advocacy” is “advocating as \na helping professional”. The themes within this subcategory were referred to by participant \nCraig, who described his advocacy efforts as strongly influenced by his role as a human service \nprovider. His efforts included advocating for transgender and gender-expansive youth within \ntheir family/caregiving unit by normalizing parent/caregiver’s experience with their transgender \nor gender-expansive child, navigating parent/caregiver expectations for counseling, educating \nparents about transgender and gender-expansive identities, and holding space for the child. \n The final subcategory under “acts of advocacy” is “motivations for advocacy”. Within \nthis subcategory, themes describe how/why advocates are motivated to pursue positive change \nfor this population. Participants describe themselves as motivated to engage in acts of advocacy \nfor this population in attempts to catalyze positive change that improve current oppressive \nconditions. As a theme, participants’ motivations for engaging in advocacy efforts also exists \nunder the category of “development as an advocate”. Although these two subcategories share \nsimilarities, the themes are distinct as one emphasizes motivating factors for engaging in specific \nacts of advocacy, while the other focuses on participant’s sources of inspiration for assuming the \nrole of advocate. The subcategories identified across cases lends support to the ACA endorsed \nadvocacy model (Lewis, Arnold, House & Toporek, 2003), as these subcategories speak to \nadvocates ability to navigate a variety of systems and engage in multiple roles to effect positive \nchange for transgender and gender-expansive youth.  \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 264 \n \n \n \nDevelopment as an Advocate \nPrivilege due to perceived identity \nThe influence of previous transgender female activists \nPowerlessness \nDefinition of advocacy: \n- Child self-advocacy \n- Visible advocacy \nPrivilege \nPersonal motivation to advocate \nWitnessing a shifting worldview \nActing as an agent of change \nPerspective as rooted in personal experience \nLearning to strategize \nThe cost of “being out as a trans person”: \n- Activism: “Turning outness into your job” \n \nComing Out \nPersonal Journey: Coming out \nand surviving conversion \ntherapy \nComing out and experiencing \ntransition \nComing out, and becoming an \nadvocate \nComing out: A foundation for \nempathic understanding: \n- Gender presentation: \nNavigating society’s gender \nbinary \n \n \nTable 20 \nMental Map for Development as an Advocate \nKey: — = Category; --- = Theme \n \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 265 \n \n The category “development as an advocate” (see table 20 for mental map) contains a \nvariety of themes speaking to participants’ lived experience, and how this experience impacted \ntheir decision to assume the role of advocate for transgender and gender-expansive youth. \nGeneral themes under this primary category included participants’ privilege, particularly the \nprivilege they maintained due to other’s perception of the participants gender identity, ethnicity, \ndisability status, or sexual orientation. Participants also discussed how experiencing feelings of \npowerlessness, or being the target of discrimination or acts of hate impacted their decision to \nbecome an advocate. \n Themes under the subcategory “coming out” spoke to the role of participants’ personal \nexperience coming out as LGBTQ in their decision to assume the role of advocate. Multiple \nparticipants described being confronted with the withdrawal of support from family members \nand friends when coming out. One participant described coming out to her parents and being met \nwith sore disappointment and told that the participant would experience spiritual damnation if \nthey presented as and attempted to live as their authentic gender. Having adverse personal \nexperiences when coming out as LGBTQ seems to be a common factor in participant’s decision \nto step into the role of advocate for transgender and gender-expansive youth. It seems that \nadvocates engage in efforts in hopes of helping today’s youth have a more positive and affirming \nexperience, and to allow themselves as an advocate to “self grieve”. \n Another subcategory under “development as an advocate” is “inspiration and motivation \nto advocate”. Themes within this subcategory spoke to the role of each participants’ coming out \nprocess, and their personal experience as an LGBTQ youth, in inspiring them to advocate for \npositive change for transgender and gender-expansive youth. Several participants described \nthemselves as motivated to assume the role of advocate after they realized that their visibility as \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 266 \n \nan LGBTQ person, as an individual who experiences oppression because of their identity yet \npersists, benefited youth. These participants described transgender and gender-expansive youth’s \nneed to see adults who are like them and who care about their wellbeing, as significantly \ncontributing to their choice to embrace the role of advocate for this population. The \nsubcategories that emerged under the umbrella of “development as an advocate” were distinct \nfrom the literature described in chapter 2 of this manuscript, as current research speaks primarily \nto the process of advocacy for this population, rather than the individual experience and \ndevelopment of advocates. \nSociopolitical Context \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 267 \n \n \n \n \nSociopolitical Context \n “Transgender is the new gay” \nCommunity-based advocacy: “Uplifting what is already \nthere” \nPolicy work and advocating for systemic change vs. \n“changing the hearts and minds work” \nCultural events \nVisibility and political context \nTraversing the binary and “In-between spaces” \nBuilding a life in an oppressive sociopolitical climate \n \nSociopolitical \nContext and the \nSchool \nEnvironment \nHeteronormativity \nin the school \nenvironment \nAffirming LGBTQ \nidentity in the \nschool environment \nChallenges \nassociated with \ngender segregated \nfacilities \n \n \n \nLGBTQ \nDiscrimination \nConsequences of \noppression \nThe Trump Administration \nThe Trump administration \nPolitical is personal: Effects of \nthe Trump administration \nNational level political \ncontext: Influence on \ntransgender and gender-\nexpansive youth \n \n \n \nTable 21 \nMental Map for Sociopolitical Context \nKey: — = Category; --- = Theme \nIn-Group Politics \nSocial pressure and in-group politics \nIn-group politics within LGBTQ \nadvocacy organizations \n \nStrengths of \nTransgender and \nGender-Expansive \nYouth \nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 268 \n \n Participants’ emphasized the importance of transgender and gender-expansive youth \nseeing adults who are “like them”. Although this theme is most pertinent within the category \n“development as an advocate”, it also present in the primary category “sociopolitical context” \n(see table 21 for mental map). This category describes those social and political factors occurring \nat both the systems (i.e. societal and political environments) and individual (e.g. how individuals \nin the community or family system interact with the youth) levels, that impact advocacy efforts \nfor these youth. Under the umbrella category of “sociopolitical context”, the challenges of \nmaintaining visibility as an LGBTQ adult is referenced. Specifically, participants discuss how \nheteronormativity within institutions, particularly the school environment, has resulted in \nadvocates being formally penalized for being open about their LGBTQ identities. \n Under the primary categorical umbrella “sociopolitical context”, themes also speak to \nhistorical patterns in society’s treatment of transgender and gender-expansive youth. These \npatterns include society’s treatment of transgender and gender-expansive identities as “the new \ngay”. Multiple participants described how previous generations treated the gay, lesbian, bisexual \nand other non-heterosexual sexual orientations as devious and abnormal. They articulate how the \nLGB community was initially met with hostility, but that their existence within society seemed \nto normalize over time. These participants identified a parallel between the former adverse \nexperience of the LGB community and current discriminatory treatment of the transgender and \ngender-expansive community. \n Participants related the current treatment of the transgender and gender-expansive \ncommunity to the current political administration. The prevalence of references to President \nTrump in the data lead to the development of “the Trump administration” as a subcategory under \n“sociopolitical context”. Themes under this subcategory included “the political is personal” \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 269 \n \nwhich described how the national level political conversations, such as Trump’s statements about \npersons with disabilities or the ban of transgender individuals from serving in the military, \ndirectly impacts the experience of individuals in the LGBTQ community. One specific example \nprovided by multiple participants was the Trump administration’s recension of the Justice \nDepartment’s Title IX interpretation that ensured protections for transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth in the school environment. This change directly impacted the experience of \nthese youth within the school environment, and advocates’ ability to pursue positive change in \nschool policy. Across cases, participants described the actions of the Trump administration as \nsignificantly impacting their advocacy efforts, lending support to the sensitizing concepts \nidentified in the literature (outlined in chapter 3 of this manuscript). \n “In-group politics” was another subcategory within the primary category of \n“sociopolitical context”. Politics within the LGBTQ community were described as contributing \nto challenges and difficulties in achieving positive change for transgender and gender-expansive \nyouth. Participants described in-group politics as including individual community member’s \nbeliefs about how advocacy efforts should elevate the voices of ethnic minorities, or persons \nwith disabilities, who are also along the LGBTQ spectrum. Within group politics were also \ndescribed as the extension of patriarchal heteronormative beliefs in the LGBTQ community, with \nsome LGBTQ individuals believing that transgender and gender-expansive identities ought to \nalign with the male/female gender binary. These beliefs have negatively impacted advocates’ \nefforts by distracting from the mission of generating positive change for transgender and gender-\nexpansive youth. \n \n \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 270 \n \nChapter 5  \nDiscussion \nTriangulation of Investigators \n Over the course of the data analysis portion of this study, triangulation of investigators \nwas utilized to verify the accuracy of the coding process. While the primary investigator read \nthrough and coded each data source 3-5 times, a secondary investigator (approved by the IRB to \nparticipate in data analysis) also read through the transcripts and independently coded each based \non their intuitive process and experience as an academic and advocate for LGBTQ youth. The \nsecondary investigator, Katie Brammer, and myself then met routinely to review both of our \ncoded data and evolving conceptualization of the themes and categories emerging from the data. \nIt was discovered that both Katie and my themes and categories paralleled one another, with only \nminor distinctions in the language used to label each code or category. The results of Katie’s \ncoding was distinct from my own identified themes and categories in that Katie identified \nadditional portions of the data as fitting with specific themes. Katie’s feedback and identified \nthemes and categories were merged with my own results from the coding process to create a \ncohesive summarization and interpretation of the data. \nTransgender and Gender-Expansive Youth v. Children \n Over the course of the data collection and analysis portion of this study, it was \ndetermined that although children (age 12 and under) and youth (ages 12 to approximately 18-\n20) remain distinct populations, they share many of the same struggles related to their ability to \nthrive in today’s United States. Originally I bounded advocacy, the phenomenon under study, as \nconsisting of only those efforts to achieve positive social change for transgender and gender-\nexpansive children. What I realized through my interactions with advocates is that their efforts \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 271 \n \naim to promote the wellbeing of transgender and gender-expansive individuals across the \nlifespan. Therefore, they could speak to specific efforts aimed at supporting transgender and \ngender-expansive children, but most of their experience involves efforts that benefit multiple age \ngroups. For the aforementioned reasons, the write-up of results for this study frequently \nreference both transgender and gender-expansive children and youth, rather than speak solely to \nadvocacy for children. \nImplications for Counselor Education & Clinical Practice \n Counselors are called to advocate for populations who experience disenfranchisement, \noppression, and discrimination (American Counseling Association, 2014). The ALGBTIC \ncompetencies (Association of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues in Counseling, \n2009), ACA endorsed advocacy model (Lewis, Arnold, House & Toporek, 2003), Multicultural \nand Social Justice Counseling Competencies (Ratts, Singh, Nassar-McMillan, Butler & \nMcCullough, 2015), and CACREP standards (2016) also emphasize the importance of counselor \neducators’ and counseling-practitioners’ role in attending to the external factors that contribute to \nthese populations’ adverse experiences. Other sources speak to the specific application of \nadvocacy to LGBTQ populations (Lewis & Lewis, 2000). Despite these many resources, there is \nroom for an improved understanding of the lived experience of advocates for transgender and \ngender-expansive youth. \n Within counselor education programs, the case portraits contained in chapter 4 of this \nmanuscript may be used individually as examples of the real-world applications of advocacy \nstrategies. Each case also provides insight regarding the many ways that oppression impacts the \nadvocacy process, from the specific acts of advocacy, to the advocate’s ability to affect change. \nThrough the review of individual case portraits, counselors-in-training may increase the breadth \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 272 \n \nand depth of their understanding of the need for advocacy for transgender and gender-expansive \nyouth, and the many contextual dimensions that may influence the advocacy process.  \n Professional counselors who are trained in CACREP accredited institutions must receive \neducation regarding “advocacy processes needed to address institutional and social barriers that \nimpede access, equity, and success for clients” (CACREP, 2016, p. 9). The detailed description \nof individual advocate’s approach to advocacy, and the contextual variables that impact the \nprocess of pursuing social change, may aid counselors-in-training to better understand those \nbarriers that not only impact transgender and gender-expansive youth’s access to resources, but \nalso challenge the advocacy process.  \n When engaging clients at the intersection of oppressed identities, practicing counselors \nare confronted with the realities of social inequality. Review of this text may provide clinicians \nwith real-world examples of advocacy-in-action and offer insight regarding areas of need for \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth. Advocacy for this population is particularly pertinent, \nas current legislation (i.e. bills pertaining to sex designation on birth certificates, “bathroom \nbills”) and the political climate (i.e. the actions taken by the Trump administration) have left \nmembers of this community feeling helpless. This sense of helplessness is evident in each \nparticipant’s interview data and is illustrated in those portions of the case study write up that \ndiscuss social and political context. \n The case portraits provided in this manuscript, and descriptions of categories and themes \nthat characterize advocacy as a phenomenon, may be utilized as a means of educating \ncounselors-in-training and clinicians. The rich details provided in this descriptive case study give \nlife to a topic that may otherwise seem cold and impersonal, and enable students and practicing \nEXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 273 \n \nclinicians to gain insight about the challenges faced when pursuing positive change for \ntransgender and gender-expansive youth. \nSuggestions for Future Research \n The results from this qualitative study may inform additional inquiry using a quantitative \ndesign. Possible approaches for translating results from this qualitative study into additional \nresearch designs include: \nUtilizing categories and themes from this study to inform the creation of a survey regarding \nexperiences of discrimination and/or stigmatization when interacting with helping \nprofessionals (i.e. professional counselors, social workers). \nExamine the relationship between counselors-in-training awareness of privilege and \noppression, and advocacy needs of transgender/gender-expansive/queer clients across the \nlifespan. This may be completed through the use of the Awareness of Privilege and \nOppression Scale (Montress, 2003), and checklist of advocacy needs (created using \ncategories and themes from this study). \nEvaluate the relationship between counselors-in-training (in internship) advocacy \ncompetencies, and advocacy needs of transgender/gender-expansive/queer clients across the \nlifespan. This may be completed through the use of the Advocacy Competencies Self-\nAssessment (ASCA) Survey (Ratts & Ford, 2010), and checklist of advocacy needs (created \nusing categories).\nRunning head: EXPLORING ADVOCATES’ PERSPECTIVES 274 \n \nReferences \nABC (2018).

The aim of the study is to improve current understanding of the process of advocacy for this population, as well as the context in which advocacy efforts occur. Data consisted of hour long interviews, advocacy artifacts as recommended by participants, and the researcher’s field journal. Participants included 12 advocates from a variety of backgrounds and geographic locations within the United States, to include educators, community advocates, and helping professionals. Implications of this study may include increased understanding of the advocacy process, and the various ways individuals navigate social systems to affect positive change for transgender and gender-expansive children",
