He has been beaten up.. . he is really hurt .. heneeds some help,\" said concerned neighbors in a telephone call to 911emergency services, reporting the alarming presence of a young man on thestreet.' Police officers responding to the call dismissed emergency servicespersonnel from the scene and forcibly returned the young man to the apartmentof an older male, who persuaded them that the incident was nothing more than\"a homosexual tiff.\"2 In a radio report from the scene, the officers laughinglydescribed the result of their cursory investigation of the home: \"IntoxicatedAsian, naked male, was returned to his sober boyfriend.\"' When one localwoman called the police station to protest this casual disregard for the youngerman's safety and offered additional information, she was told by another officer,\"I can't do anything about somebody's sexual preferences in life.\"\" Thirtyminutes later, fourteen-year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone became the thirteenthof seventeen young men tortured, killed, mutilated, and sometimes eaten by hissupposed companion, Jeffrey Dahmer.5During the two years Laura Venable lived with Rosanne Peterson, Laura'smother urged her to leave an obviously abusive relationship: \"I can'tunderstand why Laura didn't get away from that situation. You can see it withmen fighting each other. I can't fathom this.\" 6 Friends recall that Venable wasoften a victim of emotional and physical abuse plagued by black eyes, a brokennose, and a broken finger.7 After a 1992 Christmas visit with her family,1.

Theyaccurately reflect, however, the significant disparity in legal and social responsesto domestic abuse involving same sex couples and similar cases involvingheterosexual couples. If Konerak Sinthasomphone had been a young woman,the Milwaukee police would have responded very differently, and five of JeffreyDahmer's victims might have been spared.9 If Laura Venable's abusive partnerhad been male, programs for assistance to battered women would have grantedher readier access, and she might have survived.' As this Note will show,victims of same-sex domestic violence do not receive equal protection under thelaws.\"8. See King, supra note 6, at 75.9. The Sinthasomphone family filed suit against the city of Milwaukee and two Milwaukeepolice officers, claiming a violation of Konerak Sinthasomphone's right to the equal protection ofthe laws. Attorneys for the family planned to show that the Milwaukee Police Department has athirty-year history and tradition of homophobia, sexism, and racism. The attorneys compiledabundant evidence attesting to the Department's policy or custom of non-reponse to the needs of thehomosexual community in particular and minority groups in general.

Developments in the Law: Legal Responses to Domestic Violerce, 106 HARV. L. REV.1498, 1501 (1993) [hereinafter Legal Responses]. Domestic violence occurs with sufficientfrequency to have a broad social impact and to strain the resources of the entire legal system. Id.Domestic disturbances may account for as many as 40 percent of the calls to which law enforcementagencies respond. Id. The courts, too, are overburdened in trying to deal with the problem. Id.at 1502. In addition, domestic violence has an economic impact on communities in the form ofemployee absenteeism, lost productivity, and increased health care costs. Id. Only a comprehensivelong-term solution would alleviate the problem. Id. at 1505. Among the traditional mechanismsavailable, prosecution and punishment are the best means of controlling abusers, modifying theirbehavior, and promoting public awareness of the problem.

ZOE HILTON, LEAL RESPONSES TO WIFE ASSAULT: CURRENT TRENDS ANDEVALUATION 10-18 (1993). While there is great diversity in the backgrounds and the psychologicaltraits of abusive partners, empirical data reveal common risk factors. Id. at 10. Childhood orintergenerational family violence, low income, and alcohol use are background factors appearingconsistently across the population of abusers. Id. at 11-13. Psychological traits common amongabusers include depression, low self-esteem, communication skill deficits, and inability to cope withstress. Id. at 14-18. Individuals who are characterized as extremely jealous, easily prone to anger,and emotionally volatile are also more likely to be abusive toward their partners. Id. at 22.See also DEL MARTIN, BATTERED WIVES 44 (1976). Discussing the fact that abusers comefrom all walks of life, Martin describes her interviews with a farm woman, the wife of a professionalman, and the wife of a general practitioner, all of whom experienced severe abuse. Id. at 44-45.Another example is Eisaku Sato, former prime minister of Japan and winner of the 1974 NobelPeace Prize, whose wife proudly reported that he beat her only once a week. Id. at 45. Martinpoints out that victims often describe their abusive partners as angry, resentful, and suspicious, yetsurrounded with an aura of inadequacy and insecurity. Id.15. Elizabeth M. Schneider, The Violence of Privacy, 23 CONN. L. REV. 973, 979-80 (1991).Schneider points out that the women's movement of the 1960s spawned the battered women'smovement, which revealed and discussed the problem of domestic violence openly for the first timein the nation's history. Id. at 979-80. During the past twenty years, the battered women'smovement has endeavored to create legal remedies to deal effectively with the problem of abuse, toprovide adequate services for battered women, and to educate the public about the prevalence ofbattering. Id. at 979-80. Despite this increase in public awareness, many inaccurate perceptionsabout battered women persist. Id. at 983. Perpetuating this trend is the fact that much attentionremains focussed on the battered woman rather than focusing on the batterer. Id. Studies oftencenter on the woman's pathology and level criticism at the victim for choosing to remain in therelationship. Id. Schneider argues that by focusing on the woman, society tends to perpetuate thepower of patriarchy and to legitimize male power. Id. Schneider also condemns the trend towardresolving domestic disputes through informal processes such as mediation. Id. at 988. She arguesthat the use of mediation is a reflection of the attitude that battering is a woman's problem \"thatMurphy: Queer Justice: Equal Protection for Victims of Same-Sex DomesticProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 1995338 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 30Legislatures have only recently begun to act on the problem of domestic violencein our society.' However, legislative attempts to provide protection to victimsof domestic abuse have failed to the extent that they deny protection to certainsegments of our society, especially victims of abuse at the hands of a same-sexpartner. 17The form of domestic violence that most readily comes to mind is thatwhich occurs in an opposite-sex relationship where the male is the abuser andthe female is the victim.' 8 Because of the prevailing patterns of sexual powerin our society, 9 this relationship is in fact the one in which abuse mostfrequently occurs.' In the United States each year, the number of womenabused by past or present male partners has been estimated to range from 1.8million2' to four million.' Several explanations for the disparity in thesefigures have been offered: the use of varying definitions of domestic violence,'a general pattern of underreporting, u surveys that inadequately represent theshould be worked out, and that the state has no role.\" Id. at 988-89. Schneider stresses theimportance of utilizing criminal remedies for battering that focus on punishing the abuser instead ofblaming the victim. Id. at 987-89.16. See infra note 51.17. See infra notes 51-62 and accompanying text.18. RICHARD J. GELLES, FAMILY VIOLENCE 91 (1979).

Studies show that gaymen and lesbians are victimized by abusive partners at rates proportionatelycomparable to those found among opposite-sex couples.'This Note will demonstrate that domestic violeuce between same-sexcouples is as serious a problem as domestic violence between opposite-sexcouples, but that present statutes provide victims of same-sex violence with lesslegal protection, thus raising significant equal protection concerns.

See Hunter, supra note 20, at 576. Although research rarely focuses on gay and lesbiandomestic violence, some studies show that gay and lesbian victims and abusers report growing upin households where one parent was physically abused. Id. at 576. Like heterosexual victims andabusers, gay men and lesbians who are involved in abusive relationships are likely to have abackground of family violence. Id. Also, like heterosexuals involved in abusive relationships, thesegay men and lesbians gravitate to a familiar situation where the patterns of familial domestic violenceare repeated. Id. at 577-578. The studies also disclose that the abuse that occurs in both opposite-sex and same-sex relationships involves the issue of control by one partner over the other. Id. at580.

THE SECOND CLOSET: SAME-SEX DOMESTIC VIOLENCEBecause relationships between same-sex couples do not differ in characterfrom those of opposite-sex couples,32 same-sex couples also experiencedomestic violence.\" Research suggests that domestic violence occurs in same-sex relationships with the same statistical frequency as in opposite-sexrelationships.' While few studies and little research have been done in thearea of gay and lesbian domestic violence, estimates conclude that each yearbetween fifty and one hundred thousand lesbians are the victims of abuse andthat as many as half a million gay men are battered.\" Studies also find thatthe abuse that occurs between same-sex partners has the same elements as abusein opposite-sex relationships, including dependency, jealousy, and the assertionof control by the abuser over the abused.'32. Letitia Anne Peplau, Lesbian and Gay Relationships, in HoMosExuALITY: RESEARCHIMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC POLICY 179 (John C. Gonsiorek & James D. Weinrich eds., 1991). Therelationships between same-sex and opposite-sex couples are similar in that both want enduring,stable, long-term relationships. Id. at 179. Studies of older gay men and lesbians often reveal howcommonly they have remained in stable relationships for periods of 20 years or more.

Lundy, Abuse that Dare Not Speak Its Name: Assisting Victims of Lesbian andGay Domestic Violence in Massachusetts, 28 NEW ENG. L. REV. 273, 277 (1993). The domesticviolence that same-sex victims experience is as prevalent and serious as opposite-sex violence. Id.at 277. Both same-sex and opposite-sex batterers use physical and psychological terror to controltheir victims. Id. at 282. The difference between same-sex and opposite-sex abuse has nothing todo with the behavior of the parties. Id. Instead, the difference is due to cultural and institutionalhomophobiawhich isolates the same-sex victim from needed psychological, social, and legal support.Id. at 283.34. CLAIRE M. RENZETrI, VIOLENT BETRAYAL: PARTNER ABUSE IN LESBIAN RELATIONSHIPS18 (1992). The prevalence of abuse between both same-sex and opposite-sex partners is estimatedto be approximately 25 to 30 percent of all couples. Id. at 18. Studies report: first, that 25 percentof lesbians and 27 percent of heterosexual women admit being physically abused by their partnersin committed relationships; and second, that seven percent of lesbians and nine percent ofheterosexual women report having been raped by dates. Id. See also Jane Furse, Calls for HelpAre Ignored in Gay's Domestic Violence, THE TIMES-PICAYNE, Dec. 12, 1993, at A10. Accordingto experts, the level of domestic violence in the gay community is the same as in society at large.Id. Unlike battered opposite-sex victims, however, same-sex victims are often not taken seriouslyby the police until the injuries are nearly fatal. Id.35. DAVID ISLAND & PATRICK LETELLIER, MEN WHO BEAT THE MEN WHO LOVE THEM:BATTERED GAY MEN AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 14 (1991). Despite certain misconceptions aboutthe effeminate nature of gay men, there is no evidence that gay men are any more or less violentthan straight men. Id. The domestic violence that occurs in same-sex relationships, like that inopposite-sex relationships, is the result of a number of complex psychological and environmentalfactors. Id at 64-68.36. RENZETrI, supra note 34, at 27-58. The dependency in an abusive relationship can occurin either the batterer or the victim. Id. 29. In lesbian relationships the dependency is particularlyintense because of the lack of social support outside the gay and lesbian communities. Id. Thecouple may feel isolated and look more to one another as allies against a \"hostile world.\" Id. at 31.Valparaiso University Law Review, Vol. 30, No. 1 [1995], Art. 7https://scholar.valpo.edu/vulr/vol30/iss1/71995] SAME-SEX DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 341Despite similarities which exist between domestic violence occurring insame-sex and opposite-sex relationships, a number of differences compound theseverity of domestic violence experienced by same-sex partners. Initially, same-sex partners seeking protection may encounter a police department that isunwilling to take same-sex abuse seriously. 3  When handling same-sexdomestic violence cases, police departments and courts, rather than acknowledgeor understand that abuse can and does occur between members of the same sex,often believe that a situation of mutual combat is taking place in which the same-sex partners are just fighting.' In addition, while all victims of domesticviolence experience feelings of isolation and helplessness, abused same-sexpartners are even further isolated.39 Same-sex abusers often use the threat ofexposure, or \"outing,\" as a means of repression and control against thevictim.' Even in the absence of such extortion, victims themselves may bereluctant to seek help because they fear the unpleasant consequences of publicIn an abusive lesbian relationship, however, this dependency can become a mechanism of controlto further isolate the victim. Id. at 38-39. Renzetti reports the suggestion that jealousy is the mostcommon source of conflict in same-sex relationships. Id. at 39. Because gay men and lesbians donot have access to \"the legal ties that bind,\" some argue, same-sex relationships are more fragile.1d. In addition, a heterosexual woman, jealous of another woman flirting with her partner, has noreason to be envious of her partner, but a lesbian woman may. Id. at 40. The balance of powerin same-sex and opposite-sex relationships is established and maintained in the same ways. Id. at54. An unequal contribution of financial resources often results in one partner's exertion of controlover the other. Id. The education levels and employment status of the partners may also structurethe power in the relationship. Id. at 50. Thus, dependency, jealousy, and balance of powercontribute simultaneously to the evolution of partner abuse. Id. at 55.

Ruthann Robson, Incendiary Categories: Lesbians/Violence/Law, 2 TEX. J. WOMEN & L.1, 2 (1993). Robson suggests that the isolation that same-sex victims experience is due to the law'sviolence towards them. Id. The legal system expresses violence towards homosexuals bycriminalizing their sexual activities, excluding them from certain areas of employment, and denyingthem legal protection. Id. Robson states that the \"lack of sexual orientation in a state statute is aviolent denial of the violence against us.\" Id. at 16. The law is considered the instrument of thestate that maintains state power, but the law itself is based upon force and coercion. Id. at 22.40. See Furse, supra note 34, at AI0.

Thus,internal and external forces combine to push gay and lesbian victims of domesticj41. See PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS, supra note 13, at 331 (explaining that a victim of same-sexdomestic violence may decline to seek medical treatment because his or her sexual orientation wouldthen become part of a permanent medical record, which might later become available to insurers andprospective employers).42.

Nelson quotes Jay Reed, the Director ofVictim Services in the civil rights unit of the Norfolk, Mass. District Attorney's Office. lid. Aboutgays and lesbian victims of domestic violence, Reed says, \"[W]e're where the battered women'smovement was 25 years ago.\" Id. Gay men and lesbians face existing legal and support systemsthat are hostile toward them; they are therefore much less likely to call the police for help or go intocourt to obtain a protective order. Id. See also GINNY NICARTHY, GETrINO FREE: YoU CAN ENDABUSE AND TAKE BACK YOUR LIFE 277-284 (2d ed. 1986). NiCarthy devotes a chapter to theunique disabilities faced by lesbian victims of domestic violence. Id. In most cities lesbian victimsfind that there is little or no safe shelter for them. Id. at 281. Even if certain staff members at ashelter are sympathetic to the lesbian woman's needs, the shelter administrator or board of directorsmay prohibit the staff from even discussing lesbian issues. Id. at 281-282.In some states, the failure to reach out to lesbian victims is mandated by statute. See, e.g.,IND. CODE ANN. § 12-7-2-70 (Burns 1994):'Domestic violence prevention and treatment center,\" for purposes of IC 12-18-3 and IC 12-18-4, means an organized entity:(1) Established by:(A) A city, town, county, or township; or(B) An entity exempted from the Indiana gross income tax under IC 6.2-1-3-20;and(2) Created to provide services to prevent and treat domestic violence between spousesand former spouses.43. Laurie Lico Albanese, Breaking Taboo: Helping Domestic Violence Victims, MOTHERING,Mar. 22, 1994, at 96. Despite a dramatic increase in the number of shelters, many communities stilllack basic services for battered women. Id. See also SUZANNE PHARR, HOMOPHOBIA: A WEAPONOF SEXISM 16 (1988). Since the establishment of battered women's shelters across the country,thousands of women have found refuge from their abusers. Id. The women's movement of the1960s helped women to understand that male violence against them is inappropriate and that it ispossible to live without being controlled by fear. Id.44.

For those individuals who qualify, the protection affordedunder domestic violence statutes is also far easier to obtain, as thirty-seven statesprovide some type of ex parte47 relief for victims upon filing of a complaint ofdomestic abuse.

THE EQUAL PROTECTION CHALLENGEThe equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equallaws.'3This Section raises an equal protection challenge to domestic violencestatutes that discriminate against same-sex couples. The Section begins byshowing that de jure and de facto discrimination against gay men and lesbiansmakes this type of legislation inherently suspect under the Equal ProtectionClause.\" Then the Section analyzes the constitutionality of state domesticviolence statutes under each of the three standards of review that have developedin traditional judicial interpretation of the Constitution. Part A evaluates theargument for applying strict scrutiny to domestic violence legislation thatdiscriminates against gay men and lesbians, but acknowledges the unlikelihoodthat the Supreme Court will adopt this line of reasoning.6' Part B argues thatintermediate scrutiny should be applied to this legislation: first, because gaymen and lesbians satisfy all the factors used to determine quasi-suspect60. The state statutes excluding same-sex couples are: ALASKA STAT. § 25.35.200 (1993)(offering protection only to those \"who previously lived in a spousal relationship\"); ARIz. REv.STAT. ANN. § 13-3601 (1993) (offering protection only to \"persons of the opposite sex\"); MONT.CODE ANN. § 45-5-206 (1994) (offering protection only to \"a person of the opposite sex\"); and N.C. GEN. STAT. § 50B-I (1993) (offering protection only to \"a person of the opposite sex\").61. See supra note 51. The jurisdictions which provide such protection are Alaska (ALASKASTAT § 25.35.200 (1993)), Colorado (COLO. REV. STAT. ANN. § 14-4-101 (West 1994)), theDistrict of Columbia (D.C.

The two state statutes excluding same-sex couples are: ALASKA STAT. § 25.35.200 (1993)(offering protection only in cases of \"a dating, courtship, or engagement relationship\") and MONT.CODE ANN. § 45-5-206 (1994) (offering protection only to \"a person of the opposite sex\").63.

Finally, Part C shows that even under a rationalbasis analysis, states may be unable to put forth a legitimate interest in refusingto provide protection to certain victims of domestic violence.'Legislation challenged under the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment' may be analyzed with reference to either the de jure or the defacto discrimination alleged to be at work in the statute'o The de jurediscrimination against gay men and lesbians in domestic violence statutes occursin two distinct ways. First, three state domestic violence statutes violate theEqual Protection Clause directly with the explicit language that specificallyexcludes same-sex couples by affording protection solely for persons abused bymembers of the \"opposite sex.\"\"' Second, seven additional state domesticviolence statutes exclude same-sex couples by implication,' through adefinitional use of the term \"spouse\" . The legal restrictions imposed by thesefacially discriminatory statutes renders them inherently suspect as violative ofthe Equal Protection Clause.7466.

Id. at 1512. Hesuggests that the Court should have either confronted the problem and taken action to remedy theinequality caused by disparate impact of a law or simply acknowledged that the problem cannot befixed by the judiciary.

In determining whether a right that is not enumerated in the text of the Constitution is afundamental right, the Supreme Court considers whether the right is \"implicit in the concept ofordered liberty\" or is deeply rooted in our nation's history and tradition.

The \"Don't ask; don't tell\" policy did not remove existing regulations concerninghomosexuals' service in the military. 10 U.S.C. § 654 (1994) provides the following:(a) Findings.(13) The prohibition against homosexual conduct is a long-standing element ofmilitary law that continues to be necessary in the unique circumstances of militaryservice.(14) The armed forces must maintain personnel policies that exclude personswhose presence in the armed forces would create an unacceptable risk to the armedforces' high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that arethe essence of military capability.While leaving these regulations in place, the new policy first provides for the \"Don'task\" component:(d) Sense of Congress.(1) The suspension of questioning concerning homosexuality as part of theprocessing of individuals for accession into the Armed Forces. . . should be continued,but the Secretary of Defense may reinstate that questioning . . .

SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND THE LAW § 1.03 (Roberta Achtenberg & Karen B. Mouldingeds., 1994). Some states consider a parent's sexual orientation as a factor in determining custodybut also require some nexus between the sexual orientation of the parent and the actual harm to thechildren. Id. § 1.03, at 10-11. However, in other cases a decision to terminate the custody of ahomosexual parent has been based on the perceptions of possible potential harm to the children. Id.Gay men and lesbians are often granted visitation rights which are accompanied by significantlimitations. Id. § 1.03, at 1-16. These limitations include requirements that the gay or lesbianparent's partner either not live with the parent or not be present during the children's visits. Id.There may also be prohibitions on overnight visitation by the children. Id.See also Note, Custody Denials to Parents in Same-Sex Relationships: An Equal ProtectionAnalysis, 102 HARV. L. REV. 617 (1989). Here denial of custody to gay and lesbian parents isexplicitly treated as an instance of gender discrimination:In most states that deny custody based on same-sex relationships, opposite-sexrelationships outside of marriage are less of a bar to custody or visitation than are same-sex relationships. Based on the gender of their companions, parents with same-sexcohabitants are treated differently from parents with opposite-sex companions.Presumptions against custody awards to parents in same-sex relationships thus employa gender classification. The fact that these presumptions equally affect men and womendoes not negate the gender-based nature of the classification, because a disproportionateeffect on a protected group is not necessary to trigger heightened scrutiny when stateaction employs a suspect or quasi-suspect classification.Id. at 626.Murphy: Queer Justice: Equal Protection for Victims of Same-Sex DomesticProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 1995354 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 30hostility.\"105 Lower courts, too, have taken notice of the fact that gay menand lesbians have been the object of deep prejudice and hatred.\"°Unfortunately, many of the lower courts continue to find that, despite thediscrimination against gay men and lesbians, the government's justifications forthe discrimination are either compelling or substantial enough to warrant itscontinuation.\"°t In short, gay men and lesbians have been subjected to ahistory of purposeful discrimination similar in many respects to that experiencedby any of the groups to which the Supreme Court has already afforded suspectclassification.2. Invidious discriminationSecond, the Supreme Court considers whether the discrimination against thegroup is invidious. This analysis involves asking several questions: whether thetrait has bearing on the group's ability to contribute to society; whether thegroup experiences unique disabilities due to inaccurate stereotypes; and whetherthe trait is immutable.\"° A number of lower court decisions have found thata person's sexual orientation has no bearing on that person's ability to contributeto society.\"° Nonetheless, gay men and lesbians continue to be discriminated105.

TRIB., Feb. 22, 1995, §1, at 3.The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the fall of 1995 concerning the constitutionality ofColorado's anti-gay-rights amendment. Id. In 1992, Colorado voters amended the state constitutionto prohibit laws that could protect gay men and lesbians from discrimination. Id. The ColoradoSupreme Court held that the amendment was unconstitutional, finding that it \"infringed upon afundamental right to participate equally in the political process.\" Id. The Court is not being askedto decide the issue of discriminatory treatment in housing and employment, but only whether or notvoters can prohibit laws providing protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Although the prospect seems highly unlikely, states apparently could deny voting rightsto active homosexuals, along with other citizens, under standing opinions of the Supreme Court.States may deny the right to vote to all persons who have ever been convicted of a felony, even aftertheir prison terms have been served.

Shouldthis occur, the burden would shift to the government to demonstrate that thelegislation at issue serves a compelling interest and utilizes the least restrictivemeans available to forward that interest.130Because the current Court is reluctant to extend suspect classificationbeyond race and alienage, it is unlikely that this reasoning regarding theclassification of gay men and lesbians will soon be adopted. 13' Oneimplication of granting suspect classification to gay men and lesbians would beguaranteed access to the fundamental right to marry. 13' Except for a singleshort-lived exception, 33 courts across the country have consistently refused togrant gay men and lesbians this right.\" Thus, the provision of equal127.

Gender-based DiscriminationGender-based classifications are already subject to intermediate scrutiny, asdeclared by the Supreme Court in Reed v.

Rational Basis AnalysisThe most deferential standard of review utilized in equal protectionchallenges is rational basis analysis.\"' In order to withstand an equalprotection challenge at this level of scrutiny, a legislative classification need onlybe related to a legitimate state interest. 1 When a state statute is challengedfor violating an individual's right to due process under the law, the burden is onthe individual to establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary andirrational way.\"n In an equal protection challenge, on the other hand, theburden is on the state to provide a justification for its actions.\"I While a statehas no duty to enact comprehensive domestic violence legislation, once it hasdone so, it must apply the legislation equallyto all.'

Although the rationality test involves only minimal scrutiny and a high degree of deferenceto federal and state legislatures, legal scholars have noted that:[C]ourts should strike down laws under the rationality test when it is clear that there isno purpose for a classification other than denying a benefit (even if it is not afundamental right) to a group (even a non-suspect classification) when the denial of thebenefit can serve no possible purpose other than the desire to discriminate against agroup which is disfavored by the legislature.NOWAK & ROTUNDA, supra note 70, at 589.185.

As the court of appeals found in State v.Hadinger,2\" the legislative intent behind domestic violence statutes is toprovide protection to abused persons \"regardless of their sex.\" 212 Further, inHadinger, a criminal prosecution of one woman for domestic violence againsther female partner, the court reasoned that to exclude same-sex couples fromprotection under domestic violence statutes would be to \"eviscerate the effortsof the legislature to safeguard, regardless of gender, the rights of victims ofdomestic violence.\"2Some legislatures have taken action in recognition of these policyconsiderations for protection of same-sex as well as of opposite-sex couples. In1993, for example, the state of Missouri amended its domestic violence statuteby deleting the words \"of the opposite sex\" from the section defining family orhousehold members.21 4 Following passage of this significant extension ofprotection against abuse, the bill's sponsor, Senator Joe Moseley, explained,\"this provides equal, not special, protection.\"\" 5 Even Kerri Messer, theleader of Amendment Coalition, a conservative religious organizationconsistently opposed to special legal treatment of gay men and lesbians,commented favorably on the revised domestic violence statute by stating that\"[c]riminal law should not vary no matter how a person has sex.\"216Domestic violence is a matter of public concern requiring legislation thateffectively protects all victims and vigorously condemns all perpetrators,regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

THE PROTECTION OF AN EQUAL LAW: A MODEL STATUTEOne goal of this Note is to set forth a model domestic violence statute thatwill provide equal protection to victims of domestic violence regardless of sexualorientation. The statute will assist states in expanding current domestic violencelegislation to ensure that police policies are in place which enable officers toeffectively respond to domestic violence calls. Prosecutors' offices will beencouraged to implement policies that require uniform application of the law andrepresent a commitment to the criminalization of domestic violence. In addition,the statute will provide the judiciary with stringent guidelines for dealing withabusers. A final component in a comprehensive plan is the availability ofsupport services to all victims of abuse.The statute is specifically limited in its application to persons who haveformed a legal, familial, or intimate relationship. By limiting the scope of thestatute to exclude casual acquaintances, feuding neighbors, or business or socialassociations, the statute informs abusers and society in general that acts ofdomestic violence are criminal acts that will be actively prosecuted. Further,by providing the police, prosecutors, and judges with adequate information andresources with which to work, the statute attempts to promote uniformitythrough a coordinated approach to the problem.A. Model Domestic Violence StatuteChapter 1: Definitions... § 1(1) \"Domestic violence\" is the commission or threat of any injuriousphysical act against a household member.(2) \"Household members\" includes any two adults or emancipated minors:(a) who are related by blood,(b) who are or were joined in a legal marriage,(c) who are or were residing together in an intimate relationship, or(d) who are or were in an intimate relationship but have never residedtogether.(3) \"Any two adults or emancipated minors\" involved in domestic violenceincludes opposite-sex and same-sex couples.(4) An \"intimate relationship\" involves frequent and significant emotional218. See supra notes 206-09 and accompanying text.Murphy: Queer Justice: Equal Protection for Victims of Same-Sex DomesticProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 1995372 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 30and/or physical interactions; it does not include casual business or socialassociations.(5) A \"victim\" is an adult or emancipated minor who:(a) states that they have been abused, or(b) shows visible evidence of physical injury.(6) An \"alleged abuser\" is the adult or emancipated minor who is or wasthe legal spouse or intimate partner of the victim.Chapter 2: Arrest Procedures . . .§ 1 Whether or not a warrant has beenissued, police officers responding to a domestic violence call:(1) may make an arrest if there is probable cause to believe that the allegedabuser has physically injured the victim or if physical injury to the victim isimminent; and(2) must arrest the alleged abuser whenever:(a) there is visible evidence of serious physical injury to the victim,or(b) there is an existing protective order against the alleged abuserwhich was issued for the protection of the victim under chapter threeof this statute.§ 2 Police officers responding to domestic violence calls shall provide thevictim with complete information on the availability of safe shelter, counselling,and community support services for victims of domestic violence. Theinformation shall be provided to the victim before officers leave the scene.Chapter 3: Protective Orders . . .§ 1(1) A protective order shall provide that the alleged abuser:(a) must stay away from the residence and/or place of employment ofthe victim,(b) refrain from contacting the victim, either in person, by telephone,or by mail,(c) refrain from any further acts or threats of physical violence againstthe victim,(d) refrain from taking or damaging any property belonging to thevictim.(2) A victim of domestic violence may request a protective order from acourt in the jurisdiction of the victim's or the abuser's residency.(3) The filing fees for protective orders issued under this statute shall bewaived for victims who are unable to pay. No victims of domestic abuse shallbe denied a protective order due to their indigence.(4) A victim requesting a protective order shall make a sworn statementto either a judge or the clerk of the court stating the reason for the request.(5) Mutual orders of protection shall not be issued unless a formal hearingis conducted by a judge.Valparaiso University Law Review, Vol. 30, No. 1 [1995], Art. 7https://scholar.valpo.edu/vulr/vol30/iss1/71995] SAME-SEX DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 373(6) This order shall be effective until a formal hearing is conducted, nolater than 14 days after the date of filing.Chapter 4: Pro-prosecution Policy... § 1(1) Once formal charges have been filed in a domestic violence case, theprosecutor's office shall have a two-year period within which to proceed withthe charges.(2) With the written consent of the victim, the prosecutor may offer thealleged abuser a probationary period of two years. If, during the probationaryperiod, the alleged abuser refrains from any further abuse and complies with theprovisions of any protective order that has been issued under this statute, thevictim may, at the end of the probationary period, request that the charges bedropped.(3) The victim may reinstate the initial abuse claim at any point during thetwo-year probationary period if the alleged abuser physically injures or threatensto injure the victim.Chapter 5: Judicial Sentencing Guidelines... § 1(1) If an abuser is convicted of, or pleads guilty to, a violation of thisstatute, the judge shall sentence the abuser to imprisonment in cases involvinga pattern of abuse, serious physical injury, or a significant threat of continuedharm to the victim.(2) If an abuser is convicted of, or pleads guilty to, a first-time violationof this statute, the judge may sentence the abuser either to imprisonment or toprobation, with counseling made a condition of the probation.(3) The judge may also impose fines or restitution payments in addition toimprisonment or probation. The restitution payments may be determinedaccording to the victim's lost wages, medical and counseling expenses, sheltercosts, and replacement costs for damaged or destroyed property.(4) The sentences imposed under this statute must be aimed at holding theabuser accountable, ending the abusive behavior, and meeting the needs of thevictim and of society as a whole.B. Comments and Explanations on the Proposed StatuteDomestic violence is a criminal offense. A broad definition of whatconstitutes domestic violence is necessary for several reasons. First, victimsthemselves are often unsure, when calling a police department, whether whatthey are experiencing is in fact something for which they can obtain help.2\"9219. JUE BLACKMAN, INTIMATE VIOLENCE: A STUDY OF INjusTICs 35-37 (1989).Subjectivity plays a role in a victim's determination of whether or not they have been abused, andsubjectivity also affects the outside observer's perception of domestic violence. Id. Many victimsof domestic violence absolve their abusers of any blame for the violence or go further by denyingMurphy: Queer Justice: Equal Protection for Victims of Same-Sex DomesticProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 1995374 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 30Second, it is equally important that police operators and dispatchers refrain fromdownplaying the seriousness of an abuse victim's call.' Finally, prosecutorsand judges will have the necessary statutory guidelines with which to prosecuteand convict perpetrators of domestic violence, regardless of the subjectiveseverity of the offense.\"Because many police departments, prosecutors' offices, judges, andcommunity support service personnel have not dealt regularly with same-sexpartners involved in domestic abuse, it is essential to specify, by statute, thatsame-sex couples are to be treated identically to opposite-sex couples under thedomestic violence legislation.' 2  It is necessary to specify that same-sexcouples are covered statutorily to ensure that a call for help by a victim ofdomestic violence in a same-sex relationship does not go unanswered or is notdismissed as simply a \"homosexual tiff.\"' There should be some discretiongiven to courts in determining what constitutes an intimate relationship;however, police responding to a domestic disturbance call should be instructedto respond to every call in accordance with the statutory requirements. 22that abuse is taking place. Id. It is crucial, therefore, to provide victims, police officers,prosecutors, and judges with the necessary statutory tools to categorize any threats or actual injuriousphysical acts as criminal behavior.220. GAIL A. GOOLKASIAN, U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTICE, CONFRONTING DOMEsTIC VIOLENCE:A GUIDE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES 32 (1986). Efforts to improve police response todomestic violence must begin at the first point of contact with victims of abuse. Id. If policedepartments are operating under a comprehensive domestic violence statute, there should be noconcern that domestic violence calls will be either screened out or assigned a low priority. Id.221. JULIE E. HAMOS, STATE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAWS AND How To PASS THEM: AMANUAL FOR LOBBYISTS 36, 40 (1980). By responding to every act of domestic violence with acriminal prosecution, the judicial system is making an important public policy statement thatdomestic violence is criminal behavior which will be punished. Id. at 36. A broad statutorydefinition of domestic violence also helps to ensure that once cases have reached the courts they willnot merely be dismissed. Id.222.

Following community outcry over thehandling of the Dahmer tragedy, the Milwaukee Police Department suspended the three officers whoresponded to the call concerning Konerak Sinthasomphone and Jeffrey Dahmer. Laurence, supranote 2, at 9. The proposed statute would clarify to all personnel involved in domestic violence casesthat their response must be the same regardless of the sexual orientation of the victim and abuser,thereby reducing the likelihood of another tragedy like the one in Milwaukee.224. The courts may not, under this statute, consider the sexual orientation of the parties whenan instance arises that requires them to verify that the parties are intimately involved with oneanother. The factors that may be considered include, but are not limited to: the length of therelationship, the economic dependency of one party on the other, whether the parties have heldValparaiso University Law Review, Vol. 30, No. 1 [1995], Art. 7https://scholar.valpo.edu/vulr/vol30/iss1/71995] SAME-SEX DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 375A necessary requisite in protecting victims of domestic violence islegislation which enables the police to immediately respond to the situation athand.' Domestic violence calls most often involve highly emotional situationsin which violence escalates quickly.2 ' To require police officers to obtain awarrant before making an arrest on a domestic violence call would causeneedless delay that could result in additional violence.' By allowing policeofficers to make arrests without a warrant if there is probable cause to believethat violence has occurred or is likely to occur, the victim is protected, and itfurther enforces the message to the abuser that domestic violence is not a privatematter, but will be dealt with through the criminal justice system.22Police must arrest an abuser in response to a domestic violence call whenit is evident that the victim has suffered serious physical injury, or if the victimhas already obtained a protective order against the abuser. One objective of thisportion of the statute is to protect victims of domestic violence by removing theabuser from the scene.2 - Further, the mandatory arrest policy alleviates thepotential for inconsistent arrest standards (particularly in the case of same-sexthemselves out to the public as a couple, and whether the parties have commingled real and personalproperty. Watts v. Watts, 405 N.W.2d 303, 306 (Wis. 1987) (discussing the factors used todetermine a marriage by estoppel).225. The National District Attorney's Association reports that more and more state courts areupholding challenges to warrantless arrests on domestic disturbance calls. See Arrest, Search andSeizure-Warrantless Search: Domestic Violence Cases; Exigent Circumstances, 14 No. 8 CASECOMMENTARIES AND BRIEFS 10, 11 (Sept. 1994).226. State v.

State v. Raines, 778 P.2d 538, 542 (Wash. Ct. App. 1989). The court found that policeofficers responding to domestic violence calls have \"a duty to ensure the present and continuedsafety and well-being\" of the victim. Id. A domestic violence call creates a sufficient indicationfor the police to conclude that an exigency exists. Id.228. HAMOS, supra note 221, at 38. A \"warrantless arrest\" policy eliminates the risk ofadditional harm that victims of abuse often face without such a policy. Id. When police respondto a domestic violence call under a policy that requires that they must either witness the abusedirectly or have already obtained a warrant, the police are often left powerless to act because mostabusers temporarily stop beating their victims in the presence of the police. Id.229. Stephen B. Reed, The Demise of Ozzie and Harriet: Effective Punishment of DomesticAbusers, 17 NEw ENO. J. ON CRIM. & CIv. CONFINEMENT 337, 342 (1991).

Research suggests that \"domestic violence offenders who werearrested had almost half as much repeat violence during the following sixmonths as offenders who were not arrested.\"\"3The issuance of a protective order can provide the victim with a certainsense of security. 2 Gay and lesbian victims of domestic violence have uniquesafety needs because their abusers can gain access to every place, such as singlesex public facilities, that the victim can go; therefore, it is essential to haveexplicit provisions that include gay men and lesbians in domestic violencelegislation. 3 It is also important to limit the availability of mutual orders ofprotection, in order to prevent abusers from using such orders as another meansof harassment and control of their victims.' In addition, the judges whodealt with same-sex domestic violence orders have often issued mutual protectiveorders because they felt unable to determine which party needed protection.5230. See HAMOS, supra note 221, at 43. Some critics argue that a mandatory arrest policy onlyserves to increase police power. Id. But see GAIL A.

In order to be effective, protective orders mustbe made available to victims as quickly as possible. Id. Some states originally required agovernment attorney to petition the court on behalf of the victim, but most states now allow victimsto make a request for a protective order on their own behalf. Id. at 845.233. Lundy, supra note 33, at 286. Gay and lesbian batterers do not seem out of place in manyof the areas where opposite-sex batterers would, including shelters and safe homes. Id. Aheterosexual woman may inform family, friends, and coworkers that her male partner is abusing her,and these persons may help to screen her telephone calls or warn her if they notice her partner nearher home or job. Id. Gay and lesbian victims may not wish to reveal their sexual orientation topersons who could offer the same type of help and must, therefore, rely more heavily upon the legalsystem for confidential assistance. Id.234. Lundy, supra note 33, at 288. Judges commonly dismiss cases of same-sex domesticviolence, finding that the alleged abuse is merely mutual fighting. Id. Possibly, a more harmful\"solution\" occurs when judges issue mutual orders of protection in same-sex cases. Id. Thisinappropriate attempt at relief gives the abuser another tool of abuse. Id.235. Robson, supra note 38, at 579. The phenomenon of issuing mutual protective ordersagainst same-sex couples may be due to the fact that most judges and others in the legal profession\"have been educated in domestic violence issues in ways which emphasize the dominant/submissivepatriarchal arrangement based on objective criteria such as gender.\" Id. Mutual protective ordersset a legal precedent that determines that any violence between same-sex partners is mutual, thusnegating the existence of same-sex domestic violence. Id. The mutual protective order has anadverse effect on the victim in another way. Robson found that in some states the issuance ofprotective orders against individuals may disqualify them from state employment, thus impactingValparaiso University Law Review, Vol. 30, No. 1 [1995], Art. 7https://scholar.valpo.edu/vulr/vol30/iss1/71995] SAME-SEX DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 377Gay and lesbian victims should not be subjected to the potential harms of mutualorders of protection simply because of the gender of their abusers.'A pro-prosecutorial policy that requires adjudication of domestic violencecases once formal charges have been filed reflects society's disdain for domesticviolence, supports the public policy of criminalizing domestic violence, and canremove the \"abuser's coercive strangle-hold over the victim. \" 237 The two-yearprobationary period contained in this model legislation allows victims time tochoose the best course of action for themselves, while providing a continualreminder to their abusers that domestic violence will not be tolerated.\" Thispro-prosecutorial policy combats the reluctance of some district attorneys toprosecute domestic violence cases. 9  Further, the policy relieves thefrustration of other district attorneys who would vigorously prosecute abusersbut often encounter victims who, for a variety of reason, refuse tocooperate.' By relieving the victim of the burden of making an immediatedecision while keeping the threat of criminal charges in the mind of the abuser,the pro-prosecutorial policy serves as an integral part of the comprehensiveapproach to eradicating domestic violence.The final component in this comprehensive plan calls for sentencingguidelines that reinforce the goal of providing protection to all victims ofdomestic violence. Arresting, charging, and imposing probation on a first-timeoffender may often prove a sufficient deterrent.\"' If courts deal firmly withthe earliest manifestation of abusive behavior, they may forestall an escalatingtheir livelihood. Id. at 580.236. See Robson, supra note 38, at 577.237. See Reed, supra note 229, at 357. Reed points out that the battered partner should notbe held in contempt for refusing to testify against the abuser, thereby further victimizing the batteredpartner. Id. See also GOOLKASIAN, supra note 230, at 4. Victims of domestic abuse areparticularly vulnerable to retaliation by the abuser, but a no-drop policy has been found to shift theresponsibility for prosecution away from the victim and onto the state. Id.238. Reed, supra note 229, at 350. Domestic violence legislation must serve the short-termgoal of effectively responding to the victims' needs, and look toward the long-term goal of breakingthe cycle of violence. Id. The legal community must deal forcefully with the abuser and besensitive to the emotional trauma that the victim is experiencing. Id. at 351.239. See Welch, supra note 229, at 1139-40. Prosecutorial discretion has often resulted incases being dropped because the responsibility for pursuing the charges is placed on victims who arefrightened and hesitant to challenge their abusers.240. STRAUS, supra note 18, at 233. Victims often fear retaliation from their abusers andwould prefer to maintain the status quo rather than risk provoking their abusers further. Id.241. HAMos, supra note 221, at 42. Deterring abusers in the early stages of a violentrelationship benefits the parties directly involved and society as a whole. Placing first-time offendersin already overcrowded jails might not benefit the victim, who may be financially dependent on theabuser, does not benefit the abuser, whose problem might be dealt with more efficiently throughcounseling, and places on society the burden of supporting the abuser and possibly the victim aswell.Murphy: Queer Justice: Equal Protection for Victims of Same-Sex DomesticProduced by The Berkeley Electronic Press, 1995378 VALPARAISO UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 30cycle of violence. 2  When continuing abuse demands more stringentmeasures, judges must be equipped with legislative directives that mandate harshsentences for all persons who commit the crime of domestic abuse, regardlessof the gender of the parties. 3 Further, the victims of abuse by a same-sexor an opposite-sex partner must be provided with a support system that includesshelter, counseling services, and court-ordered counseling for the abusers.'If gay and lesbian victims of domestic abuse sought protection under thedomestic violence statutes challenged in this Note,' they would be denied theprotective services that heterosexual victims receive, and their gay and lesbianbatterers would be exempted from prosecution.' Under the model legislationpresented here, gay and lesbian victims will be able to call the police and havetheir abusers arrested. 7  Gay and lesbian victims will have the option ofpressing criminal domestic violence charges against their abusers,' andjudges will have guidelines within which they may sentence all batterers. 49Under this model statute, the legal and social response to incidents of same-sexdomestic violence would differ dramatically, from beginning to end. Thisstatute would withstand a constitutional challenge while benefitting victims,abusers, and society as a whole.242. GOOLKASIAN, supra note 230, at 5. Some abusers will comply with protective orders andprobation because they are frightened by the prospect of serving time in jail. Id. Judges have thefinal say in the outcome of these cases, and they must act to protect the victims by determining themost effective sentence on a case-by-case basis. Id. See also Welch, supra note 229, at 1153-54(discussing the deterrent effects of imprisonment and probation on abusers based upon their standingin the community).243. HAMOS, supra note 221, at 43. From a civil libertarian perspective, an increase in policepowers, lessening procedural requirements for arrest, and strict sentencing guidelines must notbecome an excuse for an increased police presence in minority and economically disadvantagedcommunities. Id. Nonetheless, this argument cannot be used as an excuse to ignore the needs ofthe domestic violence victim.244. Symposium, Report on Domestic Violence: A Commitment to Action, 28 NEw ENG. L.Rsv. 313, 321 (1993). Victims of domestic violence must be able to reach out to trained advocateswho can explain options that are available and create a safe plan for leaving the abuser. Id. Theabusers must also have treatment if the cyclical abusive behavior is to be ended. Id. at 330.Treatment programs for batterers also serve to maintain contact with abusers who have completedjail sentences or are serving probationary terms. Id. at 332.245.

CONCLUSIONBattered women endured generations of abuse at the hands of their fathersand husbands. When the women's movement brought this problem to the publiceye, legislatures finally responded with domestic violence statutes thatcondemned abusers and protected victims. Significant societal change onlycomes as the result of a long and arduous struggle for recognition by anunpopular group. Gay and lesbian victims of domestic violence are nowengaged in just such a struggle, yet their voices alone are not strong enough tobe heard. All of us must join in their effort by criminalizing domestic violencewithout regard to gender or sexual orientation.State domestic violence legislation that discriminates, either de jure or defacto, against gay and lesbian couples cannot withstand an equal protectionchallenge. Courts should either grant quasi-suspect classification to gay men andlesbians or recognize that discrimination against them is gender discrimination.The Supreme Court's unwillingness to protect homosexual sodomy as afundamental right is irrelevant, because domestic abuse does not involve issuesof privacy, morality, or tradition. Domestic violence legislation must provideall persons with equal protection under the law.Nancy E.
