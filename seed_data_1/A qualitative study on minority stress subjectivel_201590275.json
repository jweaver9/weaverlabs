Notwithstanding,  qualitative  investigations  on  how  TGNC  peoplesubjectively  experience  minority  stress  are  still  scarce.  This  study  aims  at  exploring  the  sub-jective experiences  of  minority  stress  through  a  focus  group  with  8  Italian  TGNC  individuals(5 male-to-female,  2  female-to-male,  and  1  genderqueer;  M  =  25;  SD  =  5).  Narratives  were  ana-lyzed through  the  deductive  thematic  analysis.  The  analysis  generated  four  main  categories:(1) family  rejection;  (2)  visibility  of  the  body;  (3)  negative  effects  of  family  violence  on  health;and (4)  integration  of  TGNC  identity.  Results  offer  an  in-depth  exploration  of  minority  stressprocesses  in  TGNC  people,  as  wface with  stigma.  Suggestions  fo© 2019  Elsevier  Masson  SAS.

TGNC  people  live  systematic  violencend  oppression  throughout  their  lives  due  to  their  gen-er  nonconformity  (e.g.,  Bradford  et  al.,  2013,  Lombardi,009),  being  at  risk  of  developing  negative  health  out-omes,  such  as  anxiety,  depression,  and  suicide  ideationr  attempts  (Bockting  et  al.,  2013,  Bradford  et  al.,  2013).rom  this  perspective,  researchers  are  increasingly  focusedn  understanding  psychological  and  social  processes,  whichead  social  stigma  to  affect  mental  health  of  TGNC  peo-le  (Amodeo  et  al.,  2015,  Scandurra  et  al.,  2017a).  One  ofhe  theoretical  frameworks  aimed  at  exploring  the  negativempact  of  stigmatizing  events  on  mental  health  of  minor-ty  groups  is  the  minority  stress  theory  (MST;  Hendricks  andesta,  2012,  Meyer,  2007).The  MST  assumes  that  minority  people  experience  stressue  to  persistent  social  stigmatization.  Within  the  contextf  the  individual  environmental  circumstances,  Meyer  (2007)onceptualized  both  distal  and  proximal  stress  processes.istal  processes  are  objective  stressors  independent  of  thendividual,  while  proximal  stressors  are  dependent  on  thendividual  because  they  are  linked  to  one’s  own  feelings,houghts,  and  actions.  Both  processes  are  located  on  annvironmental  continuum,  in  which  different  stressors  act.rom  distal  to  proximal  processes,  the  stressors  are: stressful  objective  and  chronic  events  and  condi-tions  (prejudice  events,  such  as  interpersonal  violence,employment  discrimination,  or  problems  in  accessing  tohealthcare  setting); expectations  that  these  events  will  happen  and  subse-quent  surveillance  (perceived  stigma),  and; internalization  of  negative  societal  attitudes  (internalizedstigma).In  addition  to  stressors,  the  MST  also  highlights  the  role  ofrotective  factors  in  buffering  the  effects  of  minority  stressn  mental  health,  such  as  social  connectedness,  resilience,r  group  cohesion  (e.g.,  Detrie  and  Lease,  2007, Frost,  2011,candurra  et  al.,  2017d).  Thus,  stress,  resilience,  and  copingtrategies  interact  and  predict  the  development  of  mentalealth  problems.MST  was  originally  applied  to  lesbian,  gay,  and  bisex-al  people,  and  only  recently  has  been  theoretically  andmpirically  applied  to  TGNC  people  (Bockting  et  al.,  2013,endricks  and  Testa,  2012,  Testa  et  al.,  2015).  It  is  note-orthy  that  qualitative  investigations  on  how  TGNC  peopleubjectively  experience  minority  stress  are  still  scarce  espe-ially  within  the  Italian  context.  Thus,  through  the  lens  ofhe  MST,  a  qualitative  research  was  carried  out  to  explorearratives  of  a  group  of  Italian  TGNC  people  participatingn  a  focus  group.  Before  reporting  results,  a  brief  theoreti-al  introduction  to  the  TGNC  experience  of  minority  stressill  be  provided,  as  well  as  a  brief  overview  of  the  Italianontext  within  which  TGNC  population  live.clfcC.  Scandurra  et  al.inority  stress  in  TGNC  peopleegarding  the  most  distal  stressors,  the  prejudice  events,vidence  indicates  that  TGNC  people  experience  high  lev-ls  of  violence  and  discrimination.  To  this  end,  Lombardit  al.  (2011),  in  a  population  of  402  TGNC  people,  reportedhat  59.9%  of  the  sample  suffered  from  violence  andbuse,  and  that  37.1%  suffered  from  economic  discrimi-ation;  overall,  47%  were  assaulted  in  some  way  duringheir  life-time.  Again,  Bradford  et  al.  (2013), in  a  sam-le  of  350  TGNC  people,  reported  that  41%  suffered  fromransgender-related  discrimination  and  that  the  most  associ-ted  factors  were  geographic  context,  being  female-to-maleFtM),  belongingness  to  an  ethnic  minority  group,  lowocioeconomic  status,  younger  age  at  ﬁrst  transgenderwareness,  lack  of  health  insurance,  history  of  abuse,  sub-tance  use,  and  low  levels  of  community  connectedness  andamily  support.Previous  research  reported  that  psychological  problemsere  caused  by  stressful  experiences  suffered  by  TGNCeople.  For  instance,  Lombardi  (2009),  in  a  sample  of0  TGNC  people,  reported  that  transphobic  events  weressociated  with  depression  and  anxiety.  Bockting  et  al.2013), in  a  sample  of  1.093  TGNC  individuals,  reportedhat  social  stigma  was  associated  with  depression,  anxiety,nd  somatization.  Shipherd  et  al.  (2011),  in  a  sample  of7  male-to-female  (MtF)  TGNC  people,  reported  that  98%uffered  from  at  least  one  traumatic  event,  and  that  91%  suf-ered  from  multiple  traumatic  events;  among  them,  17.8%eported  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  symptoms,  while4%  reported  depressive  symptoms.Compared  to  distal  stressors,  less  research  has  beenimed  at  assessing  the  impact  of  proximal  stressors  on  TGNCealth.  To  this  end,  as  regards  the  perceived  stigma,  Beemynnd  Rankin  (2011)  reported  that  more  than  half  of  their  sam-le  (n  =  3.474)  declared  that  they  hid  their  gender  identity  tovoid  intimidation.  Similarly,  Testa  et  al.  (2012)  stated  thatGNC  people  do  not  report  violence  to  the  police  and  do  notave  access  to  medical  and  mental  health  services  due  to  theear  of  being  victimized  again.  Instead,  the  most  proximaltressor,  that  is  internalized  transphobia,  can  be  deﬁned  as  aiscomfort  with  one’s  own  TGNC  identity  due  to  the  internal-zation  of  societal  negative  gender  expectations  (Bockting,015).  Perez-Brumer  et  al.  (2015)  reported  that  internalizedransphobia  increased  the  likelihood  of  attempting  suicide,hile  Scandurra  et  al.  (2017b)  found  a  positive  associationetween  internalized  transphobia  and  both  anxiety  and  sui-ide  ideation.  Furthermore,  in  a recent  study  by  Scandurrat  al.  (2018a), it  was  found  that  internalized  transphobiaediated  the  relationship  between  prejudice  events  andegative  mental  health  outcomes,  and  that  this  relationshipas  positively  buffered  by  high  levels  of  resilience.As  regards  the  latter  point,  within  the  MST,  there  isvidence  that  TGNC  individuals  use  adaptive  strategies  touffer  the  effects  of  both  distal  and  proximal  stressors  onealth  (Pﬂum  et  al.,  2015,  Singh  et  al.,  2011,  2014,  Testat  al.,  2014).  For  instance,  Singh  et  al.  (2014)  found  thatommunity  connectedness  and  social  support  can  reduce  theevels  of  internalized  transphobia,  and  Pﬂum  et  al.  (2015)ound  that  social  support  ameliorates  the  negative  distressaused  by  prejudice  events.ople  e63Table  1  Socio-demographic  characteristics  of  participants(n =  8).PseudonymAgeGender  identiﬁcationSexual  orientationGAFaDenise  30  MtF  Straight  YesChristine  21  Genderqueer  Queer  NoRachel  28  MtF  Straight  YesSophie  25  MtF  Straight  NoPhilip 22 FtM  Straight  NoCarl 26  FtM  Straight  NoAllison  20  MtF  Straight  NoAngela  28  MtF  Lesbian  NoItis•••MPTagdgtwota1tippwhtpota••Minority  stress  in  transgender  and  gender  nonconforming  peData  presented  in  this  paragraph  show  that  MST  is  a  use-ful  framework  to  understand  psycho-social  processes  leadingsocial  stigma  to  affect  TGNC  mental  health.  Recent  evidencedemonstrated  that  the  MST  is  a  suitable  framework  to  under-stand  how  social  stigma  affects  health  in  Italian  TGNC  people(e.g.,  Amodeo  et  al.,  2018b,  Scandurra  et  al.,  2017e).The  Italian  context  for  TGNC  peopleThe  Italian  context  is  not  highly  supportive  for  TGNC  popula-tion  (e.g.,  Cussino  et  al.,  2017).  For  instance,  Italy  has  onlyrecently  established,  thanks  to  a  sentence  of  the  Court  ofAppeals  promulgate  in  2015,  that  the  gender  reassignmentsurgery  must  not  be  considered  a  prerequisite  for  modifyingone’s  own  legal  gender  status,  thus  removing  the  previousmandatory  sterilization.  Moreover,  Italy  has  not  yet  promul-gated  an  anti-discrimination  policy  to  protect  TGNC  peoplefrom  social  stigma  and  hate  crimes.  To  this  end,  a  Europeanstudy  by  Turner  et  al.  (2009)  aimed  at  mapping  hate  crimesin  Europe,  in  a  sample  of  2.669  TGNC  people,  found  thatItalian  TGNC  individuals  experienced  the  highest  percentage(51%)  of  transphobic  verbal  comments.  In  the  same  vein,  in  astudy  analyzing  the  causes  of  transphobic  murders  in  Europebetween  2008  and  2013,  Italy  was  classiﬁed  as  the  Europeancountry  with  the  second  highest  rate  of  transphobic  hatecrimes,  after  Turkey  (Prunas  et  al.,  2014).The  few  studies  that  have  assessed  the  effect  of  minor-ity  stress  on  the  health  of  Italian  TGNC  people  seem  toconﬁrm  that  such  a  population  is  at  a  risk  of  experienc-ing  stigmatizing  episodes  which,  in  turn,  can  affect  mentalhealth  (e.g.,  Amodeo  et  al.,  2015,  2018b,  Scandurra  et  al.,2017d,  2017e).  Indeed,  Scandurra  et  al.  (2017a),  in  a  sampleof  almost  150  Italian  adult  TGNC  people,  found  that  bothdistal  (i.e.,  anti-transgender  discrimination)  and  proximal(i.e.,  internalized  transphobia)  stressors  were  associatedwith  depression,  anxiety,  and  suicide  ideation.  Furthermore,in  their  study,  Scandurra  et  al.  (2017a)  found  that  supportfrom  family  and  resilience  were  able  to  buffer  the  negativeeffect  of  stressors  on  health.  On  the  other  hand,  negativehealth  outcomes  have  been  found  also  in  a  sample  of  TGNCadolescents  (Fisher  et  al.,  2017).As  speciﬁcally  regards  resilience,  a  study  by  Amodeoet  al.  (2018b)  aimed  at  assessing  the  efﬁcacy  of  anempowerment-based  group  training  program  in  increasingresilience  levels  in  a  small  group  of  Italian  TGNC  youths,highlighted  that  resilience  is  a  fundamental  coping  strat-egy  to  face  with  stigmatizing  episodes.  Summarizing  theirresults,  Amodeo  et  al.  (2018b)  deﬁned  resilience  in  TGNCindividuals  as  ‘‘the  ability  to  deﬁne  one’s  own  gender  iden-tity  and  to  generate  the  subjective  sense  of  having  a  speciﬁcgender  identity,  thus  self-recognizing  and  accepting  one’sown  trans  identity’’  (p.  13).Notwithstanding  these  ﬁndings,  to  our  knowledge  no  pre-vious  studies  have  qualitatively  investigated  how  ItalianTGNC  individuals  subjectively  experience  minority  stressand  how  they  cope  with  it.The current studyThe  current  study  aims  at  qualitatively  exploring  how  minor-ity  stress  is  subjectively  experienced  in  a  small  group  of•ua GAF: Gender afﬁrmation surgery; MtF: female-to-female;FtM: female-to-male.talian  TGNC  individuals  participating  in  a  focus  group.  Givenhe  literature  on  stigma  and  coping  in  TGNC  people  andnformed  by  the  MST,  the  main  questions  which  guided  thistudy  were: How  do  TGNC  individuals  subjectively  experience  socialstigma  towards  them? What  impact  does  the  social  stigma  have  on  TGNC  indi-viduals’  health? How  do  TGNC  individuals  cope  with  societal  stigma?ethodarticipants  and  procedureshe  present  study  involved  8  Italian  TGNC  participants,  bornnd  living  in  Naples,  a  city  of  Southern  Italy.  Considering  theender  identiﬁcation,  7  of  them  self-identiﬁed  as  transgen-er,  speciﬁcally  5  MtF  and  2  FtM.  Only  1  self-identiﬁed  asenderqueer  and  was  female-assigned-at-birth.  As  regardshe  gender  afﬁrmation  surgery,  only  2  participants  under-ent  genital  surgery,  while  all  of  them,  with  the  exceptionf  the  genderqueer  participant,  were  taking  hormones.  Par-icipants  aged  from  20  to  30  years  old  (M  =  25;  SD  =  5).  Finally,s  for  sexual  orientation,  6  self-identiﬁed  as  heterosexual, as  lesbian  and  1  as  queer.  Socio-demographic  characteris-ics  of  participants  described  above  are  reported  for  clarityn  Table  1.  In  order  to  protect  the  identities  of  participants,seudonyms  are  used  throughout  the  manuscript.Participants  were  recruited  through  the  involvement  ofersonal  contacts  of  the  fourth  author  of  the  current  work,ho  is  well  known  within  the  local  TGNC  community  foris  long  experience  in  the  advocacy  for  TGNC  rights.  Thus,hrough  a  snowball  sampling  procedure,  potential  partici-ants  were  sent  a  presentation  letter  of  the  study,  in  whichbjectives  and  methods  were  described  in  detail.  In  the  let-er,  inclusion  criteria  to  take  part  in  the  focus  group  werelso  reported,  that  were: self-identifying  as  a  TGNC  person; being  aged  between  20  and  30  years; being  born  and  living  in  Naples.Before  being  included  in  the  group,  participants  who  vol-ntarily  decided  to  take  part  in  the  study  were  invited  toeawcetoaictwysompwtaiaapccaacettwnPtEjorpFOdgrtttpmwetagasi••••bsfttdDAosdspttfatsatctrtttargt(viwR64   meeting  for  the  presentation  of  the  study.  The  meetingas  conducted  by  the  second  and  fourth  authors  of  theurrent  work.  In  that  occasion,  a  preliminary  screening  toxclude  severe  psychiatric  disorders  was  performed  withhe  participants’  informed  consent.  Following  the  meth-ds  adopted  by  Amodeo  et  al.  (2018b)  in  a  study  aimed  atssessing  the  efﬁcacy  of  a  group  training  program  in  increas-ng  resilience  levels  in  TGNC  youths,  the  current  screeningontained  questions  about  perceived  well-being  (e.g.,  ‘‘Allhings  considered,  how  satisﬁed  are  you  with  your  life  as  ahole  nowadays?’’),  symptoms  of  depression  (e.g.,  ‘‘Haveou  ever  had  a  spell  of  feeling  down  or  depressed?’’),  anduicidal  thoughts  (e.g.,  ‘‘Have  you  ever  seriously  thoughtf  ending  your  own  life?’’).  All  participants  attending  theeeting  were  recruited,  as  the  screening  showed  no  severesychiatric  disorders.The  focus  group  was  not  conducted  by  the  same  authorsho  managed  the  initial  meeting,  in  particular  becausehey  were  well  known  to  some  of  the  participants.  Thus,  tovoid  potential  interferences  on  the  research  process  (e.g.,nﬂuence  of  the  previous  knowledge  on  answers,  social  desir-bility,  etc.),  the  focus  group  was  conducted  by  the  ﬁrstuthor  of  the  current  work  who  did  not  know  any  partici-ants  and  had  a  certiﬁed  experience  in  TGNC  issues  and  inonducting  focus  groups.  During  the  focus  group,  all  parti-ipants  were  informed  again  about  the  aims  of  the  studynd  the  researcher  presented  himself  as  both  psychologistnd  expert  in  research  on  TGNC  issues.  In  the  informedonsent,  the  importance  of  answering  honestly,  the  non-xistence  of  right  answers,  the  right  for  each  participanto  leave  the  group  at  any  time,  and  the  anonymization  ofhe  participants’  identity  in  case  of  scientiﬁc  publicationere  stressed.  All  participants  gave  consent  to  report  theirarratives  in  a  scientiﬁc  manuscript.All  data  were  collected  in  accordance  of  the  General  Datarotection  Regulation  679/2016  and  the  study  was  designedo  respect  all  principles  of  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  onthical  Principles  for  Medical  Research  Involving  Human  Sub-ects.  Collected  data  were  stored  in  a  database  accessiblenly  to  the  principal  investigator,  the  ﬁrst  author  of  the  cur-ent  article,  who  masked  participants’  identities  throughseudonyms  before  sharing  data  with  other  researchers.ocus  groupne  semi-structured  focus  group  lasting  two  hours  was  con-ucted  by  the  ﬁrst  author  of  the  current  work,  as  expert  inroup  conduction  and  TGNC  research  issues.  It  was  audio-ecorded  with  the  informed  consent  of  participants  andranscribed  verbatim.  The  focus  group  was  conducted  sohat  all  participants  had  the  opportunity  to  express  theirhoughts.  As  we  were  interested  in  exploring  social  stigmarocesses  towards  one’s  own  TGNC  identity  and  copingechanisms  used  to  face  with  it  —  i.e.,  dimensions  occurringithin  collective  and  social  systems  (Brown,  2010,  Scandurrat  al.,  2017c)  —  focus  group  was  considered  more  suitablehan  individual  interviews.  Indeed,  as  suggested  by  Hughesnd  DuMont  (2002),  contrary  to  in-depth  interviews,  focusroups  speciﬁcally  provide  insights  about  both  psychologicalnd  social  processes  that  occur  in  speciﬁc  cultural  groups,hedding  light  on  their  social  realities.TiTsC.  Scandurra  et  al.In  this  study,  informed  by  the  MST,  the  focus  groupncluded  4  semi-structured  questions,  as  follows: distal  stressors  (‘‘What  kind  of  stressors,  such  as  discrim-ination,  violence,  abuse,  did  you  experience  in  your  lifedue  to  your  gender  nonconformity?’’); proximal  stressors  (‘‘How  do  you  think  these  experiencesinﬂuenced  the  perception  you  have  of  yourself  as  a  TGNCperson?’’); effect  of  stressors  on  health  (‘‘What  effect  do  you  feelthat  these  experiences  have  had  on  your  well-being  as  aTGNC  person?)  and; coping  strategies  (‘‘How  did  you  cope  with  these  experi-ences?’’).Questions  were  the  product  of  a  reﬂexive  comparisonetween  all  researchers  involved  in  the  study.  Beyond  theemi-structured  questions,  we  had  to  ask  other  questionsor  different  reasons,  such  as  to  bring  out  latent  discourses,o  guarantee  the  same  participation  to  all  participants,  oro  obtain  more  and  detailed  information  about  a  speciﬁciscourse.ata  analysiss  we  were  interested  in  qualitatively  exploring  the  effectf  social  stigma  on  TGNC  participants’  health  and  copingtrategies  using  a  clear  theoretical  framework,  i.e.  MST,ata  were  analyzed  through  a  deductive  thematic  analy-is,  that  helps  the  interpretation  of  identiﬁable  themes  andatterns  of  behavior  (Braun  and  Clarke,  2006).  Accordingo  Braun  and  Clarke  (2006), the  analysis  of  the  focus  groupranscripts  consisted  of  ﬁve  main  stages,  each  of  them  per-ormed  by  two  independent  raters  (the  ﬁrst  and  the  lastuthors  of  this  work)  to  guarantee  validity.  They  discussedo  ﬁnd  agreement  on  divergences  and  differences  in  eachtage.In  the  ﬁrst  stage,  an  initial  detailed  reading  of  the  materi-ls  served  to  familiarize  with  data.  In  this  stage,  researchersook  notes  about  their  initial  thoughts  and  highlighted  con-epts  or  phrases  considered  as  signiﬁcant  or  interesting  onhe  basis  of  MST.  In  the  second  stage,  the  transcript  wase-read  several  times  so  that  it  was  possible  to  generate  ini-ial  codes,  that  serve  to  identify  a  feature  of  the  data.  Inhe  third  stage,  initial  codes  were  transformed  into  poten-ial  themes.  Thus,  different  codes  were  combined  to  createn  overarching  theme.  In  the  fourth  stage,  themes  wereeﬁned  and  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  their  internal  homo-eneity  (i.e.,  the  data  collated  within  each  theme  adhereogether  in  a  meaningful  way)  and  external  heterogeneityi.e.,  there  are  clear  and  identiﬁable  differences  across  indi-idual  themes).  In  the  ﬁfth  stage,  themes  were  clusterednto  categories  to  which  a name  was  attributed.  Subthemesere  also  identiﬁed.esultshe  deductive  thematic  analysis  allowed  to  cluster  themesdentiﬁed  into  4  main  categories,  as  reported  in  Table  2.he  results  are  presented  with  extracts  from  the  dataset  toupport  each  category.Minority  stress  in  transgender  and  gender  nonconforming  people  e65Table  2  Themes  and  related  subthemes  identiﬁed  through  the  deductive  thematic  analysis.Theme  Subthemes1.

PridembsfbfsbietctthmVIawbtettuicfoosFamily  rejectionMost  of  participants  told  different  stigmatizing  episodes(e.g.,  verbal  or  physical  abuse,  difﬁculty  in  ﬁnding  a  job,etc.),  that  were  experienced  in  diverse  contexts  (e.g.,school,  workplace,  healthcare  systems,  etc.).  Notwithstand-ing,  in  rethinking  about  them,  all  participants  agreed  thatthe  most  signiﬁcant  stigmatizing  episodes  were  those  expe-rienced  within  the  family  of  origin,  in  particular  when  theywere  children.  For  example,  Denise  (30  yo,  MtF),  had  this  tosay:I  was  violated  as  a  child  every  time  I  was  forced  to  dosomething.  I  didn’t  like  it  but  I  had  to  behave  as  boy.  Ifelt  abused.  I  was  born  transgender  and  it  was  terrible.I  loved  to  have  long  nails,  but  my  terrible  neighbor  toldmy  mother  ‘‘Why  these  long  nails?  He’s  not  a  girl,  he’s  aboy!’’.  And  my  mother  violently  hit  me  to  educate  me.  Igave  the  Barbie  doll  to  my  sister,  but  just  because  I  couldhave  used  it  in  secret.  So,  I  missed  the  chance  to  play  withother  children.  I  felt  a  sense  of  loneliness,  emptiness  andsadness.  I  lacked  a  piece  and  this  piece  is  still  lacking!I  suffered  from  every  kind  of  violence.  I  suffered  fromharassment.  I suffered  from  everything.  I  could  live  mylife  only  in  my  fantasy.  The  dolls  were  in  my  mind,  I  wasfemale  in  my  mind,  everything  was  in  my  mind  and  onlyin  my  loneliness.This  is  a  clear  statement  about  the  ﬁrst  subtheme,  orrather  the  pain  TGCN  individuals  may  live  if  the  family  oforigin  is  rejecting  towards  their  own  gender  nonconformity(e.g.,  Koken  et  al.,  2009).  The  impossibility  for  gender  non-conforming  children  to  share  their  thoughts  and  feelingsabout  the  gender  nonconformity  itself,  or  their  needs  tobe  recognized  as  a  gender  nonconforming  child,  might  cre-ate,  as  in  the  case  of  Denise,  a  great  sense  of  loneliness(Bochicchio  et  al.,  2019),  leading  the  child  to  feel  to  befree  of  expressing  his/herself  only  in  the  mental  world.A  second  subtheme  identiﬁed  in  the  dataset  is  the  actionof  genderism  within  family.  Genderism  is  an  ideology  thatperpetuates  the  negative  evaluation  of  people  who  do  notidentify  as  cisgender;  such  an  ideology  leads  to  believe  thatnonbinary  people  are  anomalies  (Hill,  2003).  To  this  end,Rachel  (28  yo,  MtF)  stated:My  mother  didn’t  allow  me  to  wear  skirts  before  under-going  surgery,  because  people  would  have  thought  that  Ihad  something  dangling  under  my  skirt  and  it  was  frus-trating  for  her.  I  wore  a  skirt  for  the  ﬁrst  time  a  coupleb. Community  connectednessof  years  ago.  I  had  started  to  think  that  my  problem  wasmy  legs.This  statement  sheds  light  on  the  shame  that  a  parentay  feel  if  a  son  or  a  daughter  does  not  match  the  socialinary  gender  expectations.  The  last  sentence  (i.e.,  ‘‘I  hadtarted  to  think  that  my  problem  was  my  legs’’)  shows  thateelings  of  shame  coming  from  a  genderist  belief  mighte  internalized.  Furthermore,  the  social  pressure  comingrom  genderism  seems  to  lead  to  perceive  surgery  as  aolution  which  enables  TGNC  individuals  to  conform  to  theinary  view  of  gender,  preventing  a  more  subjective  self-dentiﬁcation  development  which,  as  known  (e.g.,  Vitellit  al.,  2017),  might  be  very  diverse  and  often  unhook  fromhe  genital  surgery.  As  a further  evidence  of  this  ‘‘socialage,’’  it  is  interesting  how  Allison  (20  yo,  MtF)  answered  tohe  Rachel’s  narrative:Beyond  the  personal  distress,  you  have  to  add  the  dis-ress  lived  in  your  family.  It’s  very  heavy,  or  better  extremelyeavy.  This  totally  impacts  your  behaviors,  attitudes.  . .  thisakes  your  life  a  hell,  a cage!isibility  of  the  bodyn  talking  about  proximal  stressors  (i.e.,  perceived  stigmand  internalized  transphobia),  narratives  of  participantsere  organized  around  the  role  of  their  body.  As  suggestedy  Vitelli  (2014,  2015,  2017,  2018), the  body  representshe  symbolic  and  material  place  where  the  TGNC  identityxpresses  itself  to  others.  Indeed,  most  TGNC  people  needo  change  their  body  in  order  to  adapt  it  to  the  imagehey  have  of  themselves.  The  body-image  of  TGNC  individ-als  represents  the  interface  between  subjective  internaldentiﬁcations  and  social  norms  related  to  femininity  or  mas-ulinity,  and  this  makes  the  look  of  the  Other  very  signiﬁcantor  TGNC  people.  Nevertheless,  if,  on  the  one  hand,  thether’s  gaze  is  important  for  the  identity  stabilizing  process,n  the  other  hand,  the  other  is  established  as  a constantource  of  threat.  As  Sophie  (25  yo,  MtF)  had  to  say:Society  tends  to  idealize.  Thus,  if  you  are  a  real  man  or  areal  woman,  it  will  be  more  welcoming  just  because  yourbody  gives  you  the  shape  society  wants.  That’s  the  reasonwhy  a  transgender  person  who  does  not  match  this  binaryconception  of  bodies  is  constantly  targeted.  Continuous,inquisitive  looks!  I  everyday  live  inquisition  on  my  skin.ebthapdgthtvaehf2vaeVbNToettTitbsnghieoarntiMdwtpidct66  This  statement  clearly  shows  that  one’s  own  body  mightecome  persecutory  for  some  TGNC  individuals  who  feelhemselves  constantly  looked  by  others.  This  might  have  aeavy  price  in  psychological  terms,  as  it  can  cause  shamend  self-hatred  if  internalized,  or  rather  internalized  trans-hobia  (e.g.,  Bockting,  2015,  Scandurra  et  al.,  2018a).  Theiscomfort  that  the  internalization  of  societal  normativeender  expectations,  in  other  terms  the  internalization  ofhe  look  of  the  Other,  is  well  shown  by  Carl  (26  yo,  FtM)  inis  narrative:I love  soccer  and  I’ve  always  had  the  season  ticket.  Now,on  my  card  it’s  written  C.  [female  name],  but  my  pic-ture  shows  a  boy  with  bear.  I  also  saved  40  Euros  on  thesubscription  for  women  reduction.  I  knew  that  I  wouldhave  changed  my  IDs  at  the  end  of  the  championship  andI  asked  to  pay  the  whole  price,  the  one  for  men.  Theydidn’t  allow  me  because  I  had  to  respect  the  law.  I  hadmany  problems  to  have  access  twice.  The  ﬁrst  time,  aftersome  talk,  I managed  entering.  The  second  time,  instead,I  suffered  so  much.  I  had  the  same  problem.  They  didn’tlet  me  in.  People  in  the  queue  kept  on  looking  at  me.Full  of  anger  I screamed:  ‘‘If  you  want  a  prove,  put  yourhand  in  my  slip!’’.  So,  he  told  me  to  wait  and  went  away,going  on  looking  at  me.  I  screamed  again  ‘‘Have  I  to  takeoff  my  pants?  Don’t  you  have  enough?’’.  These  peopletake  off  your  clothes  with  their  eyes.  You  cannot  have  anidea  of  the  violence  I  saw  in  those  eyes.  Those  eyes  killyou  because  they  make  you  ashamed  of  yourself.  I  hatedmyself  and  my  identity  in  that  moment.A  related  subtheme  identiﬁed  in  the  dataset  is  the  rela-ionship  between  the  body  and  intimacy.  Being  the  bodyisible,  most  TGNC  individuals  are  immediately  recognizables  TGNC  and  this  may  cause  stress  and  discomfort  (Radixt  al.,  2017).  Indeed,  visible  TGNC  individuals  experienceigher  rates  of  discrimination  compared  to  those  who  passor  cisgender  person  (Grant  et  al.,  2010,  Reisner  et  al.,015).  Even  when  TGNC  individuals  are  not  immediatelyisible  because  they  pass  for  cisgender  person,  they  mayvoid  overt  discrimination,  but  may  experience  high  lev-ls  of  anxiety  due  to  the  fear  of  disclosure  (Sevelius,  2013,itelli,  2017).  A  signiﬁcant  statement  about  the  relationshipetween  body  and  intimacy  was  by  Angela  (28  yo,  MtF):I  can’t  have  an  intimacy  about  my  life.  I  can’t  have  aspace  and  a  time  to  decide  to  whom  and  when  reveal  myidentity.  I simply  must  to  disclose  it  to  everybody,  differ-ently  from  a  gay  male  who  can  have  his  time  and  chooseto  disclose  himself  to  a  parent  ﬁrst,  to  a  brother  later,and  so  on.  A  transgender  person  has  not  this  possibility,because  she/he  has  to  face  with  somatic  changes.  Body  iscentral,  fundamental  and  visible.  It  steals  your  intimacy.I  would  have  liked  to  make  a  peaceful  path,  in  harmonywith  my  time.  But  it  hasn’t  been  possible,  because  bodydoesn’t  leave  you  privacy.egative  effects  of  family  violence  on  healthhis  theme  was  connected,  but  differentiated,  to  the  ﬁrstne  (i.e.,  ‘‘family  rejection’’).  Indeed,  in  asking  about  theffects  of  stressors  on  health,  all  participants  answeredhinking  about  their  most  signiﬁcant  stigmatizing  episodes,tldaC.  Scandurra  et  al.hat  were  those  experiencing  within  their  family  of  origin.he  ﬁrst  subtheme  identiﬁed  was  the  negative  effect  of  fam-ly  violence  on  sexual  health.  Many  participants  assertedhat  the  family  rejection  affected  how  they  experience  theirody  in  sexual  relationships.  The  effect  of  such  violence  onexual  health  is  well  shown  by  Rachel  (28  yo,  MtF)  in  herarrative:Just  3  years  ago  I  felt  proud  of  showing  my  body  on  thebeach  and  I published  on  Facebook  some  pictures  of  me.I  wondered  where  the  need  to  hide  my  body  from  mencomes  from.  Today,  I  answer  that  it  comes  from  the  abuseI  suffered  from  when  I  was  a  child,  when  I was  forced  bymy  parents  to  play  karate  because  it  would  have  mademe  more  masculine.  . . I saw  all  those  dicks  in  the  lockerroom.  .  . I  saw  dicks  everywhere  and  for  me  it  was  a  vio-lence.  That’s  the  reason  why  I’ve  many  difﬁculties  inbeing  even  touched  by  a  man.  I could  have  sex  for  the  ﬁrsttime  only  3  years  ago.  For  me,  having  sexual  intercoursewas  terrible.  Male  hands  on  my  body  were  an  abuse  forme.This  statement  clearly  shows  that  rejecting  one’s  ownender  nonconformity  may  have  detrimental  effect  onealth  and  well-being.  Notwithstanding  that,  as  reportedn  previous  research  (e.g.,  Amodeo  et  al.,  2018a,  Scandurrat  al.,  2019a,  2018a)  prejudice  events  have  a  negative  effectn  health  through  the  action  of  proximal  stressors,  suchs  internalized  stigma.  It  seemed  to  us  that  the  narrativeeported  above  clearly  illustrate  such  a  mediation  mecha-ism,  as  family  violence  negatively  affected  sexual  healthhrough  the  action  of  body  shame,  that  is  associated  withnternalized  stigma  (Greene  and  Britton,  2012, Wiseman  andoradi,  2010)  and  that  seems  to  be  caused  by  violence.A  second  subtheme  was  identiﬁed  in  the  development  ofepressive  symptoms  as  a result  of  the  family  rejection,  asell  explained  by  Philip  (22  yo,  FtM).My  father  always  told  me‘‘you  are  not  a  boy,  you  are  a  girl  and  you  must  behavelike  that’’.  I  loved  male  games,  like  football,  robots,  andso  on.  My  father  did  not  allow  me  to  play  with  these  gamesand  I  did  not  understand  why.  I  simply  liked  them.  So,  foryears,  I  thought  I  was  not  worthy  of  his  love.  I felt  down.  Isaw  my  friends’  fathers. . . they  were  not  like  mine.  Theyloved  their  children.  I felt  like  I  was  missing  a  piece.  I’vealways  wondered  if  it  was  this  that  pushed  me  to  eat  untilbecoming  overweight.  And  the  more  I  ate,  the  more  otherclassmates,  especially  during  the  middle  school  period,made  fun  of  me.  I  did  not  sleep  at  night  when  I  was  achild.  I  was  really  bad!This  statement  clearly  deals  with  the  depressive  feelingshat  may  be  developed  when  children  are  not  recognized  byarents  in  their  needs  and  desires.  It  is  probably  that  eat-ng  problems  represented  an  expression  or  a  correlate  of  aepressive  mood.  It  is  noteworthy  to  highlight  the  viciousircle  on  which  Philip  sheds  light:  family  violence  seemedo  cause  depressive  symptoms  that,  maybe,  were  expressedhrough  eating  problems  which,  in  turn,  caused  other  vio-ence  (i.e.,  bullying  in  school).  This  seems  to  conﬁrm  theetrimental  effect  that  family  violence  may  have  on  childrennd,  in  a  chain  reaction,  on  adolescents.opletvhps—bmpnsowstaFtpaGosig(ps(stpsimobbtIettaplLiaocb(voMinority  stress  in  transgender  and  gender  nonconforming  peIntegration  of  TGNC  identityIn  talking  about  strategies  to  cope  with  stigmatizingepisodes,  the  discourses  of  participants  were  organizedaround  the  process  of  TGNC  identity  integration  within  theirSelf,  in  particular  around  pride  feelings  and  community  con-nectedness,  that  were  the  two  subthemes  identiﬁed.TGNC  identity  development  represents  a  very  complexprocess  constituted  by  different  stages  (e.g.,  Devor,  2004,Lev,  2004).  This  process  is  not  linear  and  can  assume  speciﬁccharacteristics,  leading  to  different  outcomes.  Both  Devor(2004)  and  Lev  (2004)  assigned  a  central  role  to  pride  feel-ings  toward  TGNC  identity,  speciﬁcally  in  the  latter  stagesof  their  TGNC  identity  development  models.  Lev  (2004)afﬁrmed  that  pride  is  a  dimension  which  indicates  a senseof  identity  integration,  and  this  is  well  explained  by  Angela(28  yo,  MtF):I bring  always  my  condition,  my  body,  with  myself,together  with  my  story.  Making  people  proud  of  them-selves  is  necessary,  because  they  do  not  have  to  rejectwhat  they  are.  .  .  they  have  to  love  their  body  even  ifit  negatively  impacted  their  story.  Most  MtF  transgenderpeople  reject  themselves.  They  have  to  ﬁght  for  whatthey  are.  They  have  to  ﬁght  in  society,  to  make  it  awareof  their  identity.  Today,  when  I  meet  new  people,  I don’tmind  anymore  to  disclose  my  identity,  because  othershave  to  understand  that  we  are  similar,  but  also  different.We  are  all  human  beings.Another  statement  which  clearly  deals  with  pride  dimen-sion  is  that  by  Christine  (21  yo,  genderqueer):My  sister  didn’t  want  to  call  me  with  my  new  gender-neutral  name.  She  went  on  calling  me  with  my  originalfemale  name.  But  I  had  the  courage  to  tell  her  and  mydad  ‘‘call  me  C.  [new  name]  .  .  .  this  is  my  real  identity’’.I  felt  very  proud  of  myself.  I’m  very  proud  of  my  identity!The  identity  integration  process  seems  to  be  stronglyfacilitated  by  the  community  connectedness  (i.e.,  the  sec-ond  subtheme  individuated),  as  reported  by  Sophie  (25  yo,MtF):In  the  past,  I  felt  my  transgender  condition  as  similarto  a  handicapped  one.  I  felt  like  lacking  a  part  of  me,as  if  I  had  not  an  arm.  Today,  I  feel  different.  .  .  I  haveunderstood  that  I  have  both  arms.  And  I  have  understoodthis  since  I had  the  courage  to  seek  help  from  a  localassociation.  I  came  into  contact  with  other  people  likeme  and  we  became  friends.  Now,  I  feel  a  whole!This  statement  sheds  light  on  the  protective  role  of  peergroups  which  can  be  seen  as  a  form  of  familial  support  thatmost  participants  did  not  receive  during  their  childhood.Indeed,  using  the  metaphor  by  Sophie,  peers  seem  to  actas  a  lacking  arm,  allowing  to  feel  oneself  more  integratedand,  as  a  result,  increasing  the  levels  of  self-acceptance.DiscussionThe  purpose  of  this  work  was  to  qualitatively  analyze  thesubjective  experiences  of  minority  stress  in  a  group  of  ItalianTGNC  individuals  through  the  lens  of  the  MST.  The  deductiveiuI e67hematic  analysis  generated  four  themes:  family  rejection,isibility  of  the  body,  negative  effects  of  family  violence  onealth,  and  integration  of  TGNC  identity.Although  differentiated,  the  themes  which  have  beenresented  separately  should  be  seen  as  interrelated  dimen-ions  of  a  psycho-social  process  —  i.e.,  the  minority  stress which  postulates  that  stress  mediates  the  relationshipetween  social  status  and  health  of  sexual  and  genderinority  groups  (Hatzenbuehler,  2009).  In  the  case  of  TGNCeople,  the  minority  social  status  is  represented  by  genderonconformity  itself.The  ﬁrst  theme  individuated  (i.e.,  family  rejection)howed  that  gender  nonconformity  is  stigmatized  very  early,ften  during  childhood.  This  is  in  line  with  previous  studies,hich  highlighted  that  non-TGNC  siblings  receive  greaterupport  than  TGNC  ones  (Factor  and  Rothblum,  2007)  andhat  mothers  and  fathers  are  among  the  main  perpetu-tors  of  psychological  harassment  (Gerini  et  al.,  2009).urthermore,  scientiﬁc  literature  highlights  different  meanshrough  which  family  stigma  can  be  manifested,  that  arehysical,  verbal  and  sexual  assault,  or  less  overt  means,  suchs  lack  of  emotional  support  (Factor  and  Rothblum,  2007;rossman  and  D’Augelli,  2006),  as  in  the  case  of  participantsf  the  current  study.  Family  rejection  resulted  to  be  alsotrongly  associated  with  genderism  that,  as  reported  above,s  an  ideology  which  perpetuates  a  negative  evaluation  ofender  nonconformity.  As  suggested  by  Hill  and  Willoughby2005),  ‘‘genderism  is  both  a  source  of  social  oppression  andsychological  shame,  such  that  it  can  be  imposed  on  a  per-on,  but  also  that  a person  may  internalize  these  beliefs’’p.  534).  This  is  in  line  with  what  participants  of  the  currenttudy  reported.  Indeed,  participants  clearly  expressed  thatheir  gender  nonconformity  caused  shame  feelings  in  theirarents  and  that  they  ended  up  feeling  ashamed  of  them-elves,  internalizing  those  beliefs.  In  this  complex  process,t  seems  that  the  only  solution  to  adapt  oneself  to  the  nor-ative  gender  expectations  is  to  undergo  genital  surgery,  inrder  to  solve  the  gender  nonconformity  itself.The  second  theme  individuated  (i.e.,  visibility  of  theody)  seems  to  be  a  direct  derivative  of  the  ﬁrst  theme,ecause  the  body  of  TGNC  individuals  is  not  conforming  tohe  societal  expectations  about  femininity  and  masculinity.ndeed,  body  is  in  the  foreground  for  TGNC  people  (Amodeot  al.,  2018b),  as  they  experience  an  incongruity  betweenhe  given  body  and  the  body  they  would  have  for  feelinghemselves  (Lemma,  2013).  The  incongruity  TGNC  individu-ls  suffer  from  leads  others  to  constantly  look  at  them,  inarticular  at  their  body,  and  this  may  lead  TGNC  people  toive  their  own  body  in  a  persecutory  way  (Vitelli,  2015).  Asemma  (2013)  suggested,  this  process  may  start  very  early,n  childhood,  a  period  in  which  the  others  looking  at  the  bodyre  the  parents.  Thus,  ‘‘inquisitive  looks’’,  as  reported  byne  participant  of  the  current  study,  may  be  internalized,ausing  shame  and  self-hatred  (i.e.,  internalized  transpho-ia),  as  well  as  a perception  to  be  constantly  visible  to  othersi.e.,  perceived  stigma),  regardless  of  whether  one  is  trulyisible  or  not.  This  is  probably  the  reason  why  participantsf  the  current  study  felt  that  their  intimacy  was  violated.The  latter  point  —  the  relationship  between  body  andntimacy  —  is  somehow  related  to  the  third  theme  individ-ated  (i.e.,  negative  effects  of  family  violence  on  health).ndeed,  participants  expressed  two  main  health  dimensionsethsbbrmrelSihMIimlei2ofisIsadpTssttcaTTaMAt(p(odsofafptasntiLTlornoeetNtITwuocsctstmfitirmstpobprceiprceauaeecinterventions  which  are  respectful  and  supportive  of  the68  hey  felt  to  be  affected  by  family  violence  (i.e.,  sexualealth  and  depressive  symptoms).  Analyzing  narratives,  iteemed  to  us  that  this  effect  was  not  direct,  but  mediatedy  proximal  stressors,  in  particular  by  internalized  transpho-ia.  This  is  in  line  with  a  recent  theoretical  framework  whichepresents  an  extension  of  the  MST,  that  is  the  psychologicalediation  framework  (PMF;  Hatzenbuehler,  2009).  The  PMF,ecently  applied  quantitatively  to  both  TGNC  (e.g.,  Breslowt  al.,  2015,  Scandurra  et  al.,  2018a,  Testa  et  al.,  2017)  andesbian/gay  (e.g.,  Amodeo  et  al.,  2018a,  Liao  et  al.,  2015,chwartz  et  al.,  2016)  population,  sheds  light  on  psycholog-cal  pathways  linking  stigma-related  stressors  to  negativeealth  outcomes,  assuming  that  proximal  stressors  of  theST  act  as  mediators  between  distal  stressors  and  health.t  seems  to  us  that  participants  of  the  current  study  specif-cally  highlighted  the  role  of  internalized  transphobia  as  aediator  between  family  rejection  and  health,  in  particu-ar  depressive  symptoms  and  sexual  health.  As  regards  theffect  of  violence  on  depressive  symptoms,  previous  stud-es  already  found  this  relationship  (e.g.,  Scandurra  et  al.,017a,  Testa  et  al.,  2015).  As  for  the  effect  of  violencen  sexual  health,  we  are  not  aware  of  studies  speciﬁcallyocused  on  this  association.  This  result  seems  to  be  strictlynterrelated  to  the  visibility  of  the  body,  as  the  body  repre-ents  one  of  the  ﬁelds  in  which  sexuality  is  experienced.ndeed,  as  reported  above,  the  body  may  become  per-ecutory  for  TGNC  individuals,  as  they  are  often  visiblend  recognizable.  This  may  lead  some  TGNC  individuals  toevelop  internalized  transphobia  which,  in  turn,  may  affectositive  relationships  with  others,  even  in  sexual  terms.hus,  it  is  plausible  to  hypothesize  an  association  betweenocial  stigma,  visibility  of  the  body,  and  sexuality.  Futuretudies  should  explore  both  qualitatively  and  quantitativelyhis  hypothesis.As  regards  the  last  theme  (i.e.,  integration  of  TGNC  iden-ity),  our  results  indicated  that  TGNC  individuals  tend  toope  with  stigma  through  both  internal  (i.e.,  pride  feelings)nd  external  (i.e.,  community  connectedness)  resources.hese  resources  lead  TGNC  individuals  to  integrate  their  ownGNC  identity  within  their  Self,  promoting  a  process  of  self-fﬁrmation  and  self-acceptance  that,  on  the  basis  of  theST,  may  buffer  the  negative  effects  of  violence  on  health.s  suggested  by  two  very  known  theoretical  models,  pride  ishe  latter  stage  of  the  TGNC  identity  development  processDevor,  2004,  Lev,  2004).  Speciﬁcally,  Devor  (2004)  intendedride  both  in  politically  and  personally  terms,  while  Lev2004)  reported  that  pride  is  a  dimension  indicating  a  sensef  identity  integration.  Both  authors  considered  pride  as  aimension  able  to  buffer  the  effects  that  shame  and  socialtigma  may  have  on  health.  On  the  same  line,  participantsf  the  current  study  expressed  that  pride  allowed  them  toeel  comfortable  in  disclosing  their  TGNC  identity  to  others,nd  this  may  be  interpreted  as  a  buffering  resource  in  theace  of  shame  and  persecutory  feelings.  On  the  other  hand,articipants  of  the  current  study  highlighted  the  fundamen-al  role  of  peers  and  community  connectedness  in  promoting process  of  identity  integration.  This  is  in  line  with  previoustudies  which  highlighted  that  family  as  a  primary  supportetwork  is  often  inaccessible  to  TGNC  people  and,  for  this,hey  often  ﬁnd  a  support  source  within  TGNC  communitytself  (e.g.,  Carroll  et  al.,  2002).iLsC.  Scandurra  et  al.imitationshe  main  limitation  of  the  current  study  concerns  the  localevel  of  participants,  who  were  recruited  in  a  unique  cityf  the  Southern  Italy.  This  cannot  allow  to  generalize  ouresults  to  the  Italian  context.  Furthermore,  due  to  the  smallumber  of  participants,  we  cannot  explore  the  differencesn  how  MtF,  FtM,  and  genderqueer  participants  subjectivelyxperience  minority  stress.  Future  studies  should  considerxploring  such  potential  differences  through  focus  groupshat  are  homogenous  with  respect  to  gender  identities.otwithstanding,  the  explorative  and  qualitative  nature  ofhe  study  allows  looking  at  these  limits  as  relative.mplications  for  clinical  practicehis  study  has  important  implications  for  clinicians  who  workith  TGNC  individuals.  The  MST,  indeed,  was  developed  tonderstand  those  dimensions  related  to  the  mental  healthf  sexual  and  gender  minorities  that  are  dependent  on  socialontexts  and  on  the  internalization  of  societal  attitudes.  Asuggested  by  Hendricks  and  Testa  (2012),  it  is  necessary  thatlinicians,  within  counseling  and/or  psychotherapy  interven-ions,  assess  deeply  the  different  dimensions  of  minoritytress.The  results  of  the  current  study  shed  light  on  subjec-ive  experiences  of  minority  stress  which  TGNC  individualsay  do  during  their  life  course.  The  detrimental  effect  thatamily  rejection  may  have  on  health  through  the  action  ofnternalized  transphobia  should  lead  clinicians  to  addressheir  psychological  interventions  to  mitigate  the  psycholog-cal  distress  coming  from  the  negative  self-image  which  mayesult  from  stigmatization.  As  we  showed,  stigmatizationay  affect  sexual  health  leading  to  feeling  of  shame  andelf-hatred,  as  well  as  cause  depressive  symptoms.  Applyinghe  PMF,  an  efﬁcient  clinical  work  should  be  addressed  toroximal  stressors,  as  they  link  violence  to  negative  healthutcomes.  Thus,  clinically  working  on  internalized  transpho-ia,  on  the  fear  of  disclosing  one’s  own  TGNC  identity,  on  theersecutory  feelings  about  one’s  own  body,  may  result  in  aelief  and,  in  turn,  may  promote  an  identity  integration  pro-ess  that  buffers  the  effects  of  stigma  on  health  (Scandurrat  al.,  2019b).At  the  same  time,  given  the  complexity  of  clinically  work-ng  on  such  deeply  encysted  dimensions,  clinicians  shoulday  attention  to  those  aspects  linked  to  social  support  andesilience.  To  this  end,  Meyer  (2007)  highlighted  the  efﬁ-acy  of  the  group  and  community  dimension  in  buffering  theffects  of  stressors  on  mental  health.  This  is  undoubtedlylso  true  for  TGNC  people.  Thus,  clinicians  should  considersing,  beyond  an  individual  approach,  a  group  approach,s  the  group  has  the  potential  to  facilitate  mirroring  andmpowerment  processes  (Amodeo  et  al.,  2017,  Espositot  al.,  2017,  2018,  Scandurra  et  al.,  2018b).Both  at  individual  and  group  level,  it  is  fundamental  thatlinicians  provide  afﬁrmative  counseling  and  psychotherapydentity  and  life  experiences  of  TGNC  people  (Korell  andorah,  2007).  Currently,  TGNC  people  may  encounter  otherources  of  stigma  within  mental  health  services,  and  thisopleBBBBBBCCDDEEFFFGGGGHHMinority  stress  in  transgender  and  gender  nonconforming  perepresents  a  powerful  and  common  barrier  for  this  popu-lation  (American  Psychological  and  Association,  2015).  Assuggested  by  McCann  and  Sharek  (2016),  TGNC  people  meetspeciﬁc  mental  health  needs,  encountering  distinct  chal-lenges  due  to  their  gender  expression  and  identity,  suchas  access  to  appropriate  services  and  treatments,  and  theresponsiveness  of  providers,  as  well  as  the  provision  of  fam-ily  support.  Mental  health  providers  should  be  aware  of  this,having  the  ethical  obligation  of  providing  a  competent  andinformed  answer  to  their  clients.ConclusionsThe  present  study  might  be  considered  a  qualitative  explo-ration  into  the  minority  stress  subjectively  experienced  by  agroup  of  TGNC  individuals.  Our  study  shows  that  TGNC  indi-viduals,  although  representing  a  resilient  community  ableto  face  with  societal  stigma,  still  experience  rejection  dueto  their  gender  nonconformity,  and  this  rejection  starts  veryearly,  during  childhood.  Early  experiences  of  rejection  seemto  set  in  motion  the  complex  process  of  minority  stresswhich,  starting  from  distal  stressors,  may  come  to  affectmental  health  and  well-being.  This  should  lead  to  imple-ment  psycho-social  interventions,  as  well  as  social  policies,aimed  at  changing  the  negative  socio-cultural  views  on  gen-der  nonconformity,  promoting  a  less  genderist  cultural  viewand  helping  families  in  supporting  gender  nonconformingchildren  in  their  identity  developmental  paths.Disclosure of interestThe  authors  declare  that  they  have  no  competing  interest.ReferencesAmerican Psychological Association.

    "abstract": "A great amount of quantitative research has largely demonstrated that transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people experience high rates of minority stress, against which they are able to exercise resilience and to use adaptive strategies buffering the negative effects of stress on health. Notwithstanding, qualitative investigations on how TGNC people subjectively experience minority stress are still scarce. This study aims at exploring the subjective experiences of minority stress through a focus group with 8 Italian TGNC individuals (5 male-to-female, 2 female-to-male, and 1 genderqueer; M = 25; SD = 5). Narratives were analyzed through the deductive thematic analysis. The analysis generated four main categories: (1) family rejection; (2) visibility of the body; (3) negative effects of family violence on health; and (4) integration of TGNC identity. Results offer an in-depth exploration of minority stress processes in TGNC people, as well as the impact of stress on health and adaptive strategies to face with stigma. Suggestions for clinical practice are discussed",
