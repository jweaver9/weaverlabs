To assess this process we require a model which represents the behaviour of all applicants for credit, yet typically we have only information about the repayment behaviour of those who have been accepted (and booked) for credit in the past.  The behaviour of those who had been rejected, if they had been accepted, is unknown.  If one estimates a model using accepted applicants only one may gain biased parameters, if those parameters are taken to apply to a model representing the behaviour of all applicants.  In addition, if cut-offs are chosen to equalise the actual and predicted number of bads then a sample of accept-only is likely to yield inappropriate cut-offs for the population of all applicants. Several techniques for reducing the magnitude of the bias have been proposed either in the literature or by consultancies.  These include extrapolation, augmentation (Hsai 1979), iterative reclassification (Joanes 1993), bivariate probit (Boyes 1989) \"parcelling\", use of the EM algorithm, (Demster, 1977) using a multinomial logistic model, (Reichert and Choi 1983), and collecting repayment performance data for rejects (Hand & Henley 1993, Ash and Meester, 2002).  The necessary assumptions for the use of these techniques and their plausibility when made about data typically used in credit scoring models have been reviewed by a number of authors (Ash & Meester 2002, Banasik et al 2001, Hand & Henley 1993, Joanes 1993, Thomas, Edelman, and Crook 2002).  Relatively little has been published which empirically compares the predictive performance of algorithms, which incorporate different possible reject inference techniques.  Two methods of extrapolation were considered by Meester (2000).  These were firstly a model built on accepted cases only, with the   2performance of rejected cases imputed from the accept-only model, and secondly, a model built on the accepted and rejected cases where the performance of the rejects had been imputed from a model estimated for the accepts and given a cut-off.  Meester found that for a revolving credit product, up until the 50th percentile score the imputed model was marginally inferior to the extrapolated model estimated for accepts only, which in turn was inferior to a model based on a sample where the performance of all cases was known.  When applied to data for an instalment credit product the imputed model performed better than the accept-only model, but was inferior to the full sample model. In the case of the bivariate probit, Banasik et al (2001) found that this modelling approach gave minimal improvement in predictive performance compared with a model based on accept-only.  Finally, acquiring credit bureau data on how rejected applicants performed on loans they were granted from other suppliers, and imputing the probability that each rejected applicant would default, given this information, is proposed by Ash & Meester (2002).  Using a sample of business leases they found at each approval rate the proportion of cases classed as bad was considerably closer to the actual proportion than if no reject inference had been used, that is, an accept-only model was employed. However, there is no published empirical evaluation of the predictive performance of the reject inference technique that is perhaps the most frequently used, augmentation (or re-weighting).  The aim of this paper is to report such an evaluation and to compare its performance with extrapolation.  In the next section we explain the technique in more detail.  In the following sections we explain our methodology and results.  The final section concludes.   3Re-weighting Although there are several variants of re-weighting, the basic method is as follows (see Table 1).  First an accept-reject (AR) model is estimated using cases which have been accepted or rejected over a given period of time by the current model.  If the model has been applied without over-rides, if the explanatory variables within it are known (call them Xold) and if the algorithm used, functional form of the model and all other parameters of the original estimation process are known, then this model can be estimated perfectly.  Otherwise it cannot be estimated perfectly.  The scores predicted by the AR model are banded and within each band, j, the numbers of rejected Rj and accepted Aj cases are found.  For each Aj there are gj good cases and bj bad cases Table 1:  Re-weighting  Number of Number of Number of Number of Band Band (j) of Goods  of Bads  Accepts Rejects Weight 1 g1 b1 A1 = g1 + b1 R1 (R1 + A1) / A1 2 g2 b2 A2 = g2 + b2 R2 (R2 + A2) / A2 . . . . . .. . . . . .. . . . . .. . . . . .. . . . . .n gn bn An = gn + bn Rn (Rn + An) / An Assuming P(g | Sj, A) = P(g | Sj , R) …...(1) then jrjjj RgAg =  where rjg  is the imputed number of goods amongst the rejects within band j;  jrj Rg  is the proportion of rejects in band j which would have been good, had they been accepted.   4Therefore the Aj accepts in band j are weighted to represent the Aj and Rj cases in the band and each Aj is weighted by (Rj + Aj)/Aj.  This is the inverse of the probability of acceptance in band j and is the probability sampling weight for band j. Since accepted scores are monotonically related to the probability of being accepted we can replace scores by these probabilities, and if instead of bands we consider individual values, where there are m possible values (because there are m cases), each row relates to P(Ai) i=1…m.  Thus each accepted case has a probability sampling weight of 1/P(Ai).  A good-bad model using the weighted accepts is then estimated. The re-weighting method has been criticised by Hand & Henley (1993 & 1994) who build on the work of Little & Rubin (1987).  To explain the criticism we define Xnew to be the vector of explanatory variables used to model good-bad repayment performance to yield the model, which will replace the original model.  The original model had a vector of explanatory variables Xold.  Hand and Henley argue that if Xold is not a subset of Xnew then the assumption of equation (1) will result in biased estimates of the probability of default.  To understand this let D = (1,0) indicate whether a case has defaulted or not .  This can be partitioned into Do and Dm where subscript o indicating this value is observed, and subscript m indicating the value is missing A = (1,0) indicate whether D is observed (in the case of previously accepted applicants) or missing (in the case of previously rejected applicants). We can write P(D = 1 | Xnew) = P(D = 1 | A = 1, Xnew).P(A = 1 | Xnew)  + P(D = 1 | A = 0, Xnew).P(A = 0 | Xnew) …...(2) If P(A) depends only on Xnew then P(D | A = 1, Xnew) = P(D = 1 | A = 0, Xnew) so equation (2) becomes   5P(D = 1 | Xnew) = P(D = 1 | A = 1, Xnew) ……(3) However, if P(D = 1 | A = 1,  Xnew) ≠ P(D = 1 | A = 0, Xnew ) then equation (3) will not hold and this will result in biased estimates.  Put simply, if there are variables in Xold which are not in Xnew , call them Xadded , but which cause P(D = 1 | A, Xnew) to vary, then in general P(D = 1 | A = 1, Xnew) ≠ P(D = 1 | A = 0, Xnew).  For equation (3) to hold, Xnew must include Xold variables so there are no variables which could cause P(D = 1 | A, Xnew) to vary; all variables affecting this probability are included in Xnew. Hand and Henley (1994) and Banasik et al (2001) show that if Xold is not a subset of Xnew then we have a case of Little and Rubin's non-ignorably missing mechanism where A depends on Xnew and on Xadded , that is variables which are in Xold but not in Xnew.  These Xadded variables affect D and so A depends on D and Xnew, which is exactly Little and Rubin's definition of the non-ignorably missing mechanism.  Since values of D depend on the probability they are observed, P(A=1), and this depends on Xold and Xadded, the omission of Xadded from the likelihood of the parameters of the D function will result in omitted variable bias in the estimated parameters. So far we have assumed that the same parameters apply to the P(D | A = 1, Xnew) model as to the P(D | A = 0, Xnew) model.  If this is false then we must establish separate models for the accepts and for the rejects. Extrapolation As with re-weighting there are several methods of extrapolation.  The method we consider is to estimate a posterior probability model using accept-only data, extrapolate the probability of default for the rejected cases and by applying a cut-off probability classify the rejected cases as either good or bad.  A new good-bad model is then estimated for all cases (See Ash and Meester 2002).   6If the regression coefficients of the good-bad model which are applicable to the accepts also apply to the rejects then this procedure would have minimal effect on the estimates of these coefficients, although the standard errors of the estimated coefficients will be understated.  However, if variables other than Xnew affect the probability of acceptance we again have the case of non-ignorably missing observations.  Again, equation (3) would not hold and extrapolation would yield biased estimates of the posterior probabilities. If Xold is a subset of Xnew and equation (3) does hold (we have Little and Rubin’s “missing at random” case) a further source of error in the predicted probabilities may occur due to the proportion of goods and bads in the training sample not being equal to the proportion in the all-applicant population.  This may cause the cut-off probabilities, which equalise the expected and actual number of bads in the training sample, to deviate from the cut-offs required to equalise the actual and predicted number of bads in the all-applicant population.  The regression model may give unbiased posterior probabilities, but applicants would be misallocated because inappropriate cut-offs may be applied. Methodology Few credit granters ever give credit to all applicants because of the potential losses from those with a high probability of default.  However, we do have a sample of all applicants for a credit product, rather than of merely accepted applicants, although certain limitations of it must be acknowledged.  The proprietary nature of the data restricts the details of it that we can describe.  To gain this product a customer must progress through two stages.  First a potential applicant must seek information about the product.  Some potential applicants are rejected at this stage and we do not have   7information about these.  We believe that this is a very small proportion of applicants.  Second, those who receive information apply for the product.  We have data on these applicants who applied in a fixed period within 1997.  Normally the credit provider would apply scoring rules to divide this group into accepts and rejects. A repayment performance is defined to be “bad” if the account was transferred for debt recovery within 12 months of the credit being first taken.  All other accounts were defined to be “good”.  This definition is obviously arbitrary but we believe it is the best possible given the indivisible nature of the definitions available to us from the data supplier.  We had available the accept-reject decision which the credit grantor would have implemented for each applicant under normal practice, although for our sample the indicated decision had not been implemented.  This decision was deterministic – there were no overrides – and was based on an existing statistical model that had been parameterised from an earlier sample.  Call this model 1.  A relatively small subset of the variables which were available to us to build a replacement model, model 2, were used in this existing model, although almost all the variables available to build model 1 were available to build model 2.  We do not know any more about the nature of model 1. In an earlier paper (Banasik et al 2001) we indicated, using the same dataset, that there was little scope for reject inference to achieve an increase in predictive performance using the data supplier’s classification of cases into accepts and rejects.  Our first objective in this paper was to examine whether re-weighting would improve the performance of an unweighted accept-only model, again using that data provider’s accept-reject classification.  Since use of an accept-only sample rather than a sample of all applicants may result in an unrepresentative hold-out sample and so erroneous   8cutoffs compared with those from an all-applicant hold-out, we examine this effect also.  Our second objective was to investigate whether our findings using the data supplier’s accept-reject classification would apply if different cutoffs were used in the original reject-accept decision.  This required fabrication.  Our final objective is to assess the performance of extrapolation. To achieve our first objective we built three models using logistic regression.  The first used the re-weighting procedures outlined above.  An accept-reject model was estimated using the data provider’s classification of whom it would have accepted and whom it would have rejected according to its current model.  A good-bad model was then estimated using the inverse of the probability of acceptance (which was estimated from the first stage) as probability sampling weights.  The second model was an unweighted good-bad model parameterised only for the accepted cases.  The third model was an unweighted good-bad model parameterised for a sample of all cases (including those that would have been rejected).  The third model yields parameters which are unbiased by sample selection effects.  We used separate weights of evidence transformations of the explanatory variables for the accept-only sample and for the sample of all applicants.  As an alternative we also used binary variables to indicate whether a case was within a weight of evidence band for a particular applicant attribute or not. The first good-bad model was estimated for a stratified random sample of all accepted applicants and the initial accept-reject model was estimated for a stratified random sample of all applicants.  The second model was estimated for a stratified random sample of accepted applicants and the third model for a stratified sample of all applicants.  The performance of each model was assessed by its performance when   9classifying each of two hold-out samples: a hold-out sample from all applicants and a hold-out sample from the accept-only.  The stratifications preserved the exact proportions of goods and bads in the hold-out sample for all applicants as in the population of all applicants. The measures of performance were the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and the percentage of hold-out sample cases correctly classified.  For both hold-out samples we set the cut-off posterior probabilities to equalise the predicted number and actual number of bads in the training sample and separately in the all-applicant hold-out sample. Results using Original Data Our results when we used the data granter’s classification of cases into accepts and rejects are shown in Tables 2 to 5.  Tables 2 and 3 show the predicted performance using weights of evidence values and Tables 4 and 5 show the results using binary variables.  We used all of the 46 variables that were available to us.

We first refer to the results using AUROC (Comparison 1 in Tables 2 and 3) where the particular issues concerning the appropriate cutoff do not arise.  Four observations can be made.  Firstly the scope for improvement by any reject inference technique is very small.  Estimating an unweighted model for accepted applicants only (Table 2) and testing this on a hold-out sample of all applicants to indicate its true predicted performance gives an AUROC of 0.7818 compared to 0.7837 for a model estimated for a sample of all applicants.  Second, establishing an unweighted accept-only model and testing it on an accept-only hold-out sample overestimated the performance of the model.  An accept-only model tested on an accept-only hold-out gave an AUROC of 0.7932 whereas the performance of the model tested on a sample of all applicants is 0.7818.  Third, using re-weighting as a method of reject inference was found to reduce the predictive performance of the model compared with an accept-only model; the AUROC values were 0.7765 (Table 3 Comparison 1) and 0.7818 (Table 2 Comparison 1) respectively.  Fourthly, estimating a reweighted model and testing it on an accept-only model also overestimated the true performance, giving an AUROC   11of 0.7875 rather than a more representative 0.7765 (Table 3 Comparison 1).  All of these results were also found using binary variables. The predictive performances using percentages correctly classified are also shown in Tables 2 and 3 for weights of evidence.  First the scope for improvement due to improved model coefficients is small: from 71.74% to 72.13% (Table 2 Comparison 2).  Second, the accept-only model tested on an accept-only hold-out (with training sample cut-offs) would considerably overestimate the model’s performance: 76.19% correctly classified compared with 70.83% when tested on an all application sample (Table 2 Comparison 2).  Third the re-weighted model gave a similar performance to the accept-only model when tested on the all-applicant sample (with the training sample cut-offs): 71.25% correct  (Table 3 Comparison 2) compared with 70.83% (Table 2 Comparison 2) respectively.  Fourthly using an accept-only hold-out with accept-only cut-offs considerably over emphasises the performance of the reweighted model compared with a hold-out of all applications: 75.97% correct compared with 71.34% respectively (Table 3 Comparison 2).  Again these results were also found using binary variables.

In order to investigate the extent to which similar results would arise were we to vary the cut-offs for an accept-reject model, a new accept-reject model had to be constructed.  Knowledge of the basis for applicant acceptance by this new model permits as well the character of our reject inference results to be better understood.  The new model required some of the data set, the 2540 Scottish cases, to be dedicated to the accept-reject model and the rest, the 9668 English and Welsh (hereafter English) cases, to be dedicated to the good-bad models.  The variables used to build each of these two types of model differed by an arbitrary selection such that each model had some variables denied the other. Typically, the accept/reject distinction would arise from a previous and perhaps somewhat obsolete credit-scoring model that distinguished good applicants from bad.  It may also to some extent reflect some over-riding of credit scores by those using such a model.  In setting up Scottish accept/reject and English good/bad models, the national difference in the data used for the two models appear as a metaphor for the   13inter-temporal difference that would separate the observations used to build two successive models.  The exclusion of some Scottish variables in the development of the English model may be considered to represent, in part, the process of over-riding the acceptance criteria provided by the Scottish model.  The exclusion of some English variables in the development of the Scottish model represents the natural tendency of new models to incorporate new variables not previously available.  The progress of time also facilitates the incorporation of more variables by providing more cases and thereby permitting more variables to enter significantly. The variable selection for the English and Scottish models was designed to retain some of the flavour of the original performance and acceptance models.  An eligible pool of variables for the accept-reject model, to be parameterised on Scottish data, was identified by three stepwise (backward Wald) regressions using Scottish, English, and UK cases, where accept-reject was the dependent variable.  An explanatory variable that survived in any one of the three equations was deemed to have possibly influenced the acceptance by the data supplier.  The eligible variables were then used to model good-bad behaviour in Scotland in a backward stepwise procedure that eliminated further variables. Determination of the variable set for the good-bad model, to be parameterised on English data, arose from a backward stepwise regression using English data, starting with all variables available to the English cases.  A few scarcely significant variables common to the English and Scottish variable sets were then eliminated from one or the other to increase the distinctiveness of the two regressor lists.  The resulting variable selections are shown in Table 6.   14Table 6:  Variables Included in the Accept-Reject and Good-Bad Equations Reference  Good-Bad Accept-Reject Number Variable Description Equation Equation 20 Time at present address  ? 33 B1  ? 40 Weeks since last county court judgement (CCJ)  ? 43 B2  ? 6 B3 ? ? 11 Television area code ? ? 15 B4 ? ? 17 Age of applicant (years)  ? ? 19 Accommodation type ? ? 22 Number of children under 16 ? ? 23 P1 ? ? 26 Has telephone ? ? 31 P2 ? ? 32 B5 ? ? 34 B6 ? ? 35 P3 ? ? 7 B7 ?  9 B8 ?  16 B9 ?  21 Type of bank/building society accounts ?  25 Occupation code ?  27 P4 ?  28 Current electoral role category ?  30 Years on electoral role at current address ?  36 B10 ?  38 P5 ?  44 B11 ?  46 B12 ?  47 B13 ?  48 Number of searches in last 6 months ?  Bn = bureau variable n;  Pn = proprietary variable n; ? denotes variable is included The English data was scored using the variable set and estimated parameters derived from the Scottish model, and then collected into five bands according to his score.  Table 7 shows the proportion of good cases in each of these non-cumulative bands and demonstrates a broad variety of performance, varying from just under 90% good in the first quintile to half that rate in the last.  Each of these bands had training and hold-out cases determined by proportional stratified random sampling whereby in each band a third of good cases and a third of bad cases were randomly allocated to the hold-out sample.  This sampling design was adopted to enhance comparability of   15corresponding hold-out and training cases and to retain the pattern of behaviour in successive bands. Finally, the bands were cumulated with each band including the cases of those bands previously above it.  These are the bands used in subsequent analysis.  Each band represents a possible placement of an acceptance threshold with the last representing a situation where all applicants are accepted.  In the tables showing banded results, that last band is one where the opportunity for reject inference does not arise.  It appears in tables that show results from reject-inference as a limiting case where no rejected cases are available to be deployed.

However, for models involving weights of evidence, separate weights of evidence were calculated for each variable for each of the five bands. To explore the extent to which weights of evidence imply constraint that may influence the scope for reject inference, each experiment has been replicated with a variable set comprising binary variables corresponding to each coarse category of each variable Banded Results Comparison 1 in Tables 8 and 9 show our results using AUROC as a performance measure and Comparison 2 in these tables show our results using percentages correctly classified.  These tables show weights of evidence results.  The results for binary variables are shown in Tables 10 and 11.  Apart from showing that the scope for any improvements in performance increased as the cut-off in the original model is raised, as was shown in an earlier paper, these tables indicate many new findings.  First by comparing Comparison 1 column 6 in Tables 8 and 9 where the hold-out relates to a sample of all applicants, it can be seen that the use of re-weighting reduces predicted performance compared with an unweighted model.  Furthermore, the deterioration is greater for bands 1 and 2 than for bands 3 and 4.  Generally, it seems the higher the cut-off score in the original accept-reject model the greater the deterioration caused by re-weighting.   17 Table 8:  Band Analysis:  Simple Logistic Model with Weights of Evidence Comparison 1:  Area under ROC:   Training  Own Band Hold-out  All-applicant Hold-out  AcceptPredicting  Sample  Number  ROC  Number  ROC  AnalysisModel  Cases  of Cases  Area  of Cases  Area  DelusionBand 1  1289  645  .8654  3222  .7821  .0833 Band 2  2578  1289  .8249  3222  .7932  .0317 Band 3  3867  1934  .8175  3222  .8009  .0166 Band 4  5156  2578  .8108  3222  .8039  .0069 Band 5  6446  3222  .8049  3222  .8049  Comparison 2:  Percentage Correctly Classified:   Own Band Hold-out Prediction  All-applicant Hold-out Prediction      Own Band Own Band   Own Band  All Band  AcceptPredicting  Number  Training  Hold-out  Number  Training  Hold-out  AnalysisModel  of Cases  Cut-off  Cut-off  of Cases  Cut-off  Cut-off  DelusionBand 1  645  89.30%  89.77%  3222  70.20%  72.56%  19.10%Band 2  1289  83.40%  83.86%  3222  70.58%  72.75%  12.82%Band 3  1934  79.21%  79.42%  3222  71.97%  73.49%  7.24%Band 4  2578  75.37%  75.56%  3222  72.47%  73.81%  2.90%Band 5  3222  73.65%  73.49%  3222  73.65%  73.49%    Table 9:  Band Analysis:  Re-weighted Logistic Model with Weights of EvidenceComparison 1:  Area under ROC:   Training  Own Band Hold-out  All-applicant Hold-out  AcceptPredicting  Sample  Number  ROC  Number  ROC  AnalysisModel  Cases  of Cases  Area  of Cases  Area  DelusionBand 1  1289  645  .8483  3222  .7374  .1109 Band 2  2578  1289  .7509  3222  .7104  .0405 Band 3  3867  1934  .8034  3222  .7920  .0114 Band 4  5156  2578  .8017  3222  .8036  –.0019 Band 5  6446  3222  .8049  3222  .8049  Comparison 2:  Percentage Correctly Classified:   Own Band Hold-out Prediction  All-applicant Hold-out Prediction      Own Band Own Band   Own Band  All Band  AcceptPredicting  Number  Training  Hold-out  Number  Training  Hold-out  AnalysisModel  of Cases  Cut-off  Cut-off  of Cases  Cut-off  Cut-off  DelusionBand 1  645  88.37%  88.53%  3222  69.77%  68.96%  18.60%Band 2  1289  80.45%  80.92%  3222  68.56%  67.60%  11.89%Band 3  1934  79.42%  79.42%  3222  72.38%  72.94%  7.04%Band 4  2578  75.68%  75.80%  3222  72.84%  73.74%  2.84%Band 5  3222  73.65%  73.49%  3222  73.65%  73.49%     18 Table 10:  Band Analysis:  Simple Logistic Model with Binary Variables Comparison 1:  Area under ROC:   Training  Own Band Hold-out  All-applicant Hold-out  AcceptPredicting  Sample  Number  ROC  Number  ROC  AnalysisModel  Cases  of Cases  Area  of Cases  Area  DelusionBand 1  1289  645  .8484  3222  .7372  .1113 Band 2  2578  1289  .8202  3222  .7874  .0328 Band 3  3867  1934  .8235  3222  .8043  .0192 Band 4  5156  2578  .8150  3222  .8056  .0094 Band 5  6446  3222  .8068  3222  .8068   Comparison 2:  Percentage Correctly Classified:   Own Band Hold-out Prediction  All-applicant Hold-out Prediction      Own Band Own Band   Own Band  All Band  AcceptPredicting  Number  Training  Hold-out  Number  Training  Hold-out  AnalysisModel  of Cases  Cut-off  Cut-off  of Cases  Cut-off  Cut-off  DelusionBand 1  645  87.44%  88.22%  3222  68.65%  70.14%  18.79%Band 2  1289  82.78%  84.48%  3222  69.46%  72.87%  13.32%Band 3  1934  79.94%  80.46%  3222  72.13%  74.18%  7.81%Band 4  2578  76.03%  76.18%  3222  72.91%  74.36%  3.12%Band 5  3222  74.24%  74.30%  3222  74.24%  74.30%    Table 11:  Band Analysis:  Re-weighted Logistic Model with Binary Variables Comparison 1:  Area under ROC:   Training  Own Band Hold-out  All-applicant Hold-out  AcceptPredicting  Sample  Number  ROC  Number  ROC  AnalysisModel  Cases  of Cases  Area  of Cases  Area  DelusionBand 1  1289  645  .8635  3222  .7089  .1546 Band 2  2578  1289  .7681  3222  .7480  .0201 Band 3  3867  1934  .8083  3222  .7928  .0155 Band 4  5156  2578  .8097  3222  .7997  .0100 Band 5  6446  3222  .7424  3222  .7424   Comparison 2:  Percentage Correctly Classified:   Own Band Hold-out Prediction  All-applicant Hold-out Prediction      Own Band Own Band   Own Band  All Band  AcceptPredicting  Number  Training  Hold-out  Number  Training  Hold-out  AnalysisModel  of Cases  Cut-off  Cut-off  of Cases  Cut-off  Cut-off  DelusionBand 1  645  88.22%  89.15%  3222  67.44%  67.66%  20.78%Band 2  1289  81.92%  82.93%  3222  70.24%  71.26%  11.68%Band 3  1934  79.11%  79.73%  3222  71.38%  74.30%  7.73%Band 4  2578  77.23%  77.27%  3222  74.02%  74.18%  3.21%Band 5  3222  74.24%  74.30%  3222  74.24%  74.30%     19Second by comparing the performance when tested on a hold-out from the accept-only (i.e. for each band separately) with that found when using a hold-out for all applicants (Comparison 1 in Tables 8 and 9, column 4 with column 6) it can be seen that the former is overoptimistic in its indicated result.  This is true for the unweighted model and for the model with re-weighting.  For example, if the original accept-reject model had a high cut-off (band 1) and the analyst used these accepts to build and test a model, the indicated performance would be an AUROC of 0.8654 whereas the performance on a sample representative of all applicants would be 0.7821 (Table 8 Comparison 1).  The difference of 0.0833 is indicative of the error that would be made and we call this ‘accept analysis delusion’.  Values of this delusion are shown in column 7 in Tables 8 and 9.  Notice that the size of the delusion is positively and monotonically related to the height of the cut-off in the original accept-reject model.  Consistent results are gained when binary variables are used. Our results using the percentage correctly classified are shown in Comparison 2 of Tables 8 and 9.  Since an analyst would use the hold-out sample merely to test a model whose parameters (including the cut-off) were calculated from a training sample, one can see from columns 3 and 6 that the size of the delusion is substantial at cut-offs which equate expected and actual numbers of bads in the training band.  For example, with a high cut-off (band 1) in the original accept–reject model the delusion is 19.10% of cases in both the unweighted and weighted models. Secondly, column 6 of Comparison 2 in each of Tables 8 –11 indicates the modest scope for improved classification by using information about the good-bad behaviour of rejected applicants.  Each result in that column indicates classification performance over applicants from all bands when parameters and cut-offs are taken from the   20particular band.  In particular, the cut-off is taken such that predicted and actual numbers of goods in the training sample are equal.  In this way the chosen cut-off reflects in part the band’s own good-bad ratio, and takes no account of the all-applicant good-bad ratio.  As we move from the low risk Band 1 to the higher risk bands below it we observe classification performances that approach that which is possible when no applicant is rejected.  In Table 8, for example, the maximum scope for improved classification is only 3.45% (73.65% – 70.20%).  At best reject inference can but close this gap by producing better regression coefficients and/or by indication better cut-off points. Thirdly, column 7 of Comparison 2 in each of Table 8 – 11 suggests a negligible scope for reject inference to improve classification performance were the population good-bad rate to be actually known.  In that column each band reports classification where each applicant is scored using regression coefficients arising from estimation in that band’s training sample.  However, the cut-off score is that which will equate the number of predicted bads among all applicants with the actual number of bads in the hold-out sample of all applicants.  In this way each band’s cut-off is determined by a good sample-based indication of the good-bad ratio for the whole population of applicants.  As we move from the low risk Band 1 to the higher risk bands below it we see a maximum scope for improved classification of only .83% (73.49% – 72.56%).  Indeed for all but the top two bands there is no scope for improvement at all.  The negative scope for improvement in Band 4 (73.49% – 73.81%) must be seen as a reflection of sample error and indicates thereby how precariously small is even the improvement potential for Band 1.   21Of course, knowledge of the population good-bad ratio required to generated the results of column 7 in Comparison 2 is unlikely to be available, and so column 6 remains the likely indication to an analyst of the scope for reject inference to improve classification.  However, since the scope for improvement all but vanishes in the presence of a suitable cut-off point, there seems correspondingly negligible potential benefit from the removal of bias or inefficiency in the estimation of regression coefficients used to score the applicants. Finally, turning to the actual classification performance when re-weighting is used to attempt improvement in the estimation of regression coefficients, corresponding elements in column 6 of Comparison 2 of Tables 8 and 9 indicate very small improvements for Bands 3 and 4 and worse performances in Bands 1 and 2.  For example, in Band 1 the performance of the reweighted model is 69.77% compared with 70.20% for the unweighted model, yet in Band 4 the corresponding performances are 72.84% and 72.47%, respectively.  An interesting comparison feature of the re-weighting procedure is shown by comparing Table 8, column 7 with Table 9 column 7.  Table 9 column 7 presents a relatively large scope for improved performance even in the presence of a suitable cut-off that reflects knowledge of the population good-bad ratio.  The potential for improvement is 4.43% (73.49% - 68.96%).   Therefore, while re-weighting undermines predictive performance by a minimal amount without such knowledge, it appears to undermine ability to deploy such information.  Again these results were found when binary variables were used instead of weights of evidence. Extrapolation Results The foregoing discussion has demonstrated relatively little potential for improved regression coefficients but indicates considerable scope for using the population good-  22bad ratio to advantage.  Extrapolation is mainly an attempt to obtain a good indication of that ratio.  Rejects are first classified as good or bad by using a good-bad model parameterised using the training accept-only sample together with cut-offs which equalise the actual and predicted number of bads in the training sample of a particular band.  These predictions are then combined with the actual good-bad values observed in the band, and an all-applicant model is calculated.  This second model can hardly be expected to produce very different coefficients, so any scope for improvement will arise out of the application of a cut-off that reflects the good-bad ratio imputed for the all-applicant sample.   Table 12 shows that extrapolation gave a virtually identical predictive performance compared with model estimated only for the accepts.  This is roughly true for every band.  With binary variables the results are almost consistently better albeit by a small amount.  With weights of evidence the results seem very slightly worse when using extrapolation.  However, that result might be reversed were the weights of evidence to be recalibrated using the imputed values of good-bad performance as in principle they should have been.  The small margins of potential benefit indicated provide but a hint of what further research might indicate.

The data set reflects a situation in which virtually no applicant was rejected in order for the data supplier to infer the character of the population of all applicants.  The virtual absence of actual rejection in the supplied data has permitted consideration of both very high and low notional acceptance thresholds. Unfortunately, neither an actual accept-reject score for each applicant nor the underlying model for determining it was available.  Nevertheless availability of the accept-reject status that the data supplier would normally implement for each applicant has permitted an explicit and realistic accept-reject model to be fabricated.  While this model does not reflect actual experience, it provides an explicit and plausible basis for inferring whether applicants might have been accepted. One very clear result is the extent to which measures of predictive performance based on a hold-out sample of accepted applicants are liable to be misleadingly optimistic.  This might have been expected in cases where the good-bad ratio is high, but the results presented here provide an empirical indication the possible extent of error. The other analytical findings seem quite plain.  First, even where a very large proportion of applicants are rejected, the scope for improving on a model parameterised only on those accepted appears modest.  Where the rejection rate is not so large, that scope appears to be very small indeed.  That result is consistent with the data originally provided concerning the actual acceptance status of applicants and with the banded analysis that deploys a notional acceptance status.  Secondly, reject   24inference in the form of re-weighting applicants within a training sample of accepted cases and adopting a cut-off point based on those accepted cases appears to perform no better than unweighted estimation.  In fact where the rejection rate is high, results appear to be quite noticeably worse.  Thirdly, re-weighting appears to impede useful application of knowledge about the good-bad rate prevailing in the population, but without providing any compensating benefit.  Finally, reject inference in the form of extrapolation appears to be both useless and harmless.  It tends to leave regression coefficients unchanged, but the indication it provides about the population’s good-bad rate seems to be inadequately accurate to provide benefit in spite of being informed by observed attributes of rejected applicants. Useful implementation of reject inference seems to depend on accurate estimation of the potential good-bad ratio for the population of all applicants.  Simple application of that ratio then seems indicated.  More elaborate tweaking of a vast set of coefficients does not seem to promise much potential benefit on the basis of the findings presented here.   25References Ash, D. and Meester, S. (2002).
