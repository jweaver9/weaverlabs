To add to the complication of thedevelopmental tasks as adolescents, gay and lesbian youth face even more confusion anddifficulty because of a lack of social support from people in their community, peers, andfamily.  Considering the fact that many gay and lesbian people experience some form ofviolence, discrimination, rejection, isolation, or harassment, it is important to know whatfactors contribute to the ability of gay and lesbian people to cope in times of stress.     A review of literature shows that the development of gay and lesbian youths does notnecessarily lead to self-destructive behavior when resilience factors are involved.  It isalso shown in the literature that having a positive attitude about the self as a gay person iscritical for having a positive attitude toward self in general.  The purpose of this studywas to conduct an extensive research of the literature describing the factors that assistwith gay and lesbian resiliency.  Issues of self-concept and identity development werecritiqued and conclusions from the research were drawn.     Through the analysis of the literature, it was found that there are tremendousimplications for mental health and school counselors.  Counselors can be an excellentsource of help for gay and lesbian individuals, but there are generally not enoughsufficiently trained counselors to deal with adolescents and self-concept, identity, andresilient aspects of their lives.  Comprehensive counseling training programs shouldincorporate grief, abandonment, shame, and loss issues.     Future research is needed to examine the importance of self-esteem and how thisresearch can assist in designing interventions to enhance self-esteem.  Furtherinvestigation is also needed in relation to self-concept among gay and lesbian individuals.There is a need for studies of resilience to examine the ways in which combinations offactors may act to influence resilience.  Finally, the role of siblings in the coming outprocess should be explored.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS     I would like to thank my friends and family for being great sources of support for mewhile conducting this research project.

Not only would I like to thank him for his tremendous dedication to hisstudents, I would like to thank him for his encouragement, enthusiasm, availability,advice, friendship, support, and his belief in me.Table of ContentsAbstract  1                                  Acknowledgements 3Table of Contents 4Chapter IIntroduction 5Purpose of the Study 9Chapter IIReview of Literature 10Self-Concept 10Resiliency 13Resiliency Among Gay & Lesbian Individuals 16Identity 18Gay & Lesbian Identity Development 20Chapter IIICritique and Critical Analysis 28Future Research 30References 32Chapter IIntroduction      It has become increasingly well documented that risk factors for adolescents relatedto childhood and families have an accumulative role in determining risk, but lessrecognized that not all children raised in adverse circumstances experience mental healthor adjustment problems. “There has been a large amount of research into the social andfamilial correlates of childhood and adolescent problems and notably conduct problems,juvenile offending and substance abuse.  There is growing and clear evidence to suggestthat what identifies high risk children and families is an accumulation of difficulties andadversities which may include poverty and economic difficulties, parental deviance ormental illness, impaired parenting and child rearing practices, abuse, family conflict andfamily change” (Fergusson & Lynskey, 1996, p.281).     However, “research on gay youths is limited and developmental studies are rare.Theories of adolescent development ignore the existence of gay youths or depict themand their behavior as deviant.  Their strengths tend to be ignored and one self-destructivedevelopmental pathway is applied to all.  Most literature on gay youths is problem-focused emphasizing the potential for dysfunction of the most vulnerable members withinthis population” (Anderson, 1998, p.55).     The present literature does not acknowledge that there are a variety of developmentalpathways that gay and lesbian youths follow.  There is a misrepresentation and distortionof these people.  According to Anderson (1998), this lack of accurate data plays a part inthe “inadequate provision of services for gay young people in child welfare, mentalhealth, health care, education, and juvenile justice” (p.55).     A major turning point in life for all young people is dealing with the developmentaltasks of adolescence.  To make this challenging event even more difficult, complicated,and confusing, gay youths do not receive the same level of social support from people intheir community, peers, and family.  This may be taken for granted by heterosexualadolescents.  “Viewed as a threat to family and to the heterosexual identity of non-gay/lesbian peers, they are frequently abandoned and reacted to critically and often withopen hostility.  This creates a life crisis for gay young people different from that faced bynon-gay youths” (Anderson, 1998, p. 56).     Cass (1985) identifies six stages of developmental changes that occur among gay andlesbian individuals.  There are cognitive, behavioral, and affective dimensions thatdescribe the stages of homosexual identity formation.  These stages include:  1.  IdentityConfusion; 2.  Identity Comparison; 3.  Identity Tolerance; 4.  Identity Acceptance; 5.Identity Pride; and 6.  Identity Synthesis.  These stages will be described in the review ofliterature.     Gay and lesbian people face severe discrimination, and violence and harassment arefrequent. Many adolescents who are becoming aware of homosexual feelings tend to findlittle or no support from peers, family, and society. Societal recognition of gay andlesbian relationships is nominal.  Extreme social isolation and rejection is oftenexperienced.   “These factors render gay adolescents vulnerable to depression,internalized homophobia, violence, dropping out of school, homelessness, prostitution,substance abuse, and suicide” (Radkowsky & Siegel, 1997, p. 200).     Considering the fact that many gay and lesbian people experience some form ofviolence, discrimination, rejection, isolation, or harassment, it is important to know whatfactors contribute to the ability of gay and lesbian people to cope in times of stress.  It isimportant to know what the strengths are for gay and lesbian people because not only dothey have to confront the developmental tasks of adolescence, but also stresses that arerelated to a gay or lesbian identity.     Most gay identity theorists believe that having a positive attitude about the self as agay person is critical for having a positive attitude toward the self in general.  Accordingto Radkowsky & Siegel (1997), the fact that “many gay adolescents do eventually emergewith a positive identity suggests that they are able to develop a strong sense of crisiscompetence” (p. 212).  These notions of positive attitude about the self and crisiscompetence relate to the concept of resiliency.     Over the past fifty years, research has revealed that parenting styles have a strongimpact on child and adolescent development (Parish & McCluskey, 1992).  The amountof love and acceptance that parents provide has been found to be related to theirchildren’s self-concept and self-esteem.  Recently, researchers have begun to expandtheir investigation of the influences of family on gay and lesbian youth (Beaty, 1999).Savin-Williams (1989) found that lesbian individuals feel most comfortable with theirsexual orientation when both parents accept their homosexuality.  However, the mother’sacceptance was found to be more important as compared with the father’s acceptance.     Cass (1984) asserts that “self images are the cognitive components making up aperson’s overall self-concept” (p. 144).  This includes the “internal pictures” which aperson relates to some component of self.  For example, a gay or lesbian self-image refersto an internal picture relating to sexual preference.  The self-image is recognized by eachperson in his or her own way and it is given meaning by that individual.     It is also believed that the coming-out process is the result of gay self-identification.There is variation in the organization of the identity structure among gay individuals.Multiple identities are experience among gay people, including a sexual one.  Differentsituations require different role behaviors (Vincke, DeRycke, & Bolton, 1999).  Salienceis a basic organizing principle of having multiple identities (Hoelter, 1985).     Weinberg and Williams (1974) demonstrated that keeping one’s sexual orientation asecret was related to feelings of depression and awkwardness in interpersonalrelationships, along with shame and anxiety.  They found that the factors facilitating goodadjustment included rejecting the illness model of homosexuality, having close andsupportive associations with other gay men and lesbians, and rejecting the notion thatsexual orientation may be changed.     Mills (1995) states that resilient people tend to exhibit a positive outlook, a feeling ofbeing in control of their lives, the ability to defer gratification to achieve long-term goals,the ability to use critical thinking and planning skills, and a sense of humor and goodsocial skills.  Higgens (1994) maintains that in broad terms, “resilience is the ability tofunction psychologically at a level far greater than expected given a person’s earlierdevelopmental experiences.  Subjects are able to negotiate significant challenges todevelopment yet consistently “snap back” in order to complete the importantdevelopmental tasks that confront them as they grow” (pp. 1, 17).     Higgins (1994) found that resilient people “tend to negotiate an abundance ofemotionally hazardous experiences proactively rather than reactively, thus solvingproblems flexibly; they make positive meanings out of their experiences, activelyconstructing a positive vision despite emotional disappointments, and they demonstrate astrong capacity to form and then nurture a vision of an interpersonal world that is moresatisfying than one from which they emerged” (p. 20).     A review of the literature shows that the development of gay youths does notnecessarily lead to self-destructive behavior when resiliency factors are involved.  Studieshave also shown that having a positive attitude about the self as a gay person is criticalfor having a positive attitude toward the self in general.Purpose of the Study     The purpose of this study is to conduct an extensive research of the literaturedescribing the factors that assist with gay and lesbian resiliency.  Issues of self-conceptand identity development will also be critiqued and conclusions from the literature willbe drawn.  The areas that will be focused on include:1. Self-concept and how it is related to gay and lesbian individuals.2. Stages of identity development among gay and lesbian individuals.3. Methods of coping and resiliency factors concerning gay and lesbianindividuals.Chapter IIReview of Literature     This chapter reviews the literature on self-concept and how it is related to self-perceptions and self-esteem; identity; resiliency, and the factors associated with it; and,the stressors, coping strategies, self-concept, and resiliency related to gay and lesbianindividuals.Self-Concept     Self-concept is said to reflect an individual’s comprehensive sense of self and is astable or generalized sense of self (Leonard, Beauvais, & Scholl, 1999).  Aspects of theself add to self-esteem in accordance with the importance of that aspect (Kling, Ryff, &Essex, 1997).  People have perceptions of three attributes:  traits, competencies, andvalues.  Traits are the repeated behavioral patterns of ourselves and others (i.e., lazy ordependable).  Competencies are individuals’ perceptions of what skills, abilities, talents,and knowledge they possess.  Values are “concepts and beliefs about desirable end statesor behaviors that transcend specific situations, guide selection, or evaluation of behaviorand events, and are ordered by relative importance” (Leonard, et al., 1999, p. 975).     Samuels (1977) states that the important dimensions of self-concept are body self (orbody image), cognitive self, social self, and self-esteem.  Body image includes thatphysical and sexual self and plays a major role in psychological growth.  “Theinternalized mental image we have of ourselves in our minds may or may not closelyresemble our actual body structure” (p.24).  If the cognitive construction of self (reality)conflicts with the “somatic perception of self, integration of the total self becomesdifficult” (p.24).  It is task of normal development for this integration to occur.  Thesocial self includes the racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious self.  “Cognition is a processby which individuals become aware of and gain meaning from an object or events in theirenvironment” (p. 28).     According to Leonard et al. (1999), an individual’s concept of self is made up of threeinterrelated sets of self-perceptions:  the perceived self, the ideal self, and a set of socialidentities.  The perceived self consists of the perceptions that people hold about theiractual traits, competencies, and values.  This involves where individuals see themselvesrelated to their ideal selves.  The strength of the perception is also taken intoconsideration.  People with a strong perception of self are rather firm in their perceptionsof an attribute level.  People with a weak perception of self are rather unsure of anattribute level.     “The self-fulfilling prophecy is based on the assumption that children will behave asothers expect them to behave.  Since behavior reflects self-feelings, the self-fulfillingprophecy is a description of how our self-concept is affected by significant others; that is,we see ourselves and act as others treat us and expect us to act” (Samuels, 1977, p. 96).     The ideal self is made up of the traits, competencies, and values an individual wouldlike to possess (Rogers, cited in Leonard et al., 1999).  The person believes that he has acertain trait, competency, or value, or wants others to believe this.  Social identities arethe components of a person’s self-concept that originate from the social categories (i.e.,doctor or musician) to which they perceive themselves as belonging (Leonard et al.,1999, Grossman & Kerner, 1998).     Leonard et al. (1999) also claim that there are two major types of self-concept basedmotivation:  external and internal sources.  Self-concept motivation is externally basedwhen the individual is primarily other-directed.  The ideal self is derived by adopting therole expectations of reference groups.  The individual attempts to meet the expectationsof others by behaving in ways that will elicit social feedback consistent with self-perceptions.  The individual behaves in ways that satisfy reference group members, firstto gain acceptance and then to gain status.     Self-concept motivation will be internally based when the individual is primarilyinner-directed.  The individual sets internal standards that become the basis for the idealself.  The person attempts to first reinforce perceptions of competency and later achievehigher levels of competency.  It is important to these people that their efforts arenecessary in achieving outcomes and that their ideas and actions are helpful inperforming a job well.  It is not important that others provide reinforcing feedback.Individuals experience both internally- and externally-based self-concept to varyingdegrees (Leonard et al., 1999).     Self-perceptions are formed through the processes of attitude formation, attitudechange, and self-attribution.  Interaction with one’s environment presents feedback whichis related to one’s traits, competencies, and values.  A strongly held self-perception isformed when feedback is clear, abundant, and consistent.  Weakly held self-perceptionsare formed when feedback is lacking or inconsistent (Leonard et al., 1999).     Children who discount the importance of aspects of the self in which they are lesscompetent are more likely to report high levels of self-worth (Kling et al., 1997).According to a study done by O’Dea and Abraham (1999), male and female adolescentsare similar in their rankings of the importance of different characteristics of self-concept.They considered having close relationships, doing well at school and work, and beingromantically appealing as relating most to how they feel about themselves.  “Malestudents in general have greater self-esteem than do female students.  However, femaleswere found to have higher self-concept regarding the ability to form close relationships”(p. 77).  It was also found in this study that “self-concept was highest in postpubertalmales and lowest in postmenarcheal females.  Thus, puberty may have opposite effectson the self-esteem of male and female students” (p. 78).Resiliency     Resiliency is the process of bouncing back from adversity.  It encompasses thepsychological damage and the enduring strength that can result from struggling withhardship.  These strengths include resiliencies such as:  insight, independence,relationships, initiative, creativity, humor, and morality.  For each of the resiliencies thereare three developmental phases:  child, adolescent, and adult.  In children, resilienciesappear as unformed and not associated with a goal.  In adolescents, these behaviorssharpen and become deliberate.  In adults, they expand and have more depth and becomea continuing part of the self  (Project Resilience, version current November 11, 1999).     Some children cope well with highly adverse childhood experiences both as childrenand later as adults.  These children have been referred to as invulnerable, invincible, andresilient.  “Responses to stress are influenced by appraisal of the situation and by aperson’s capacity to process the experience, attach meaning to it, and to incorporate theexperience into his belief system.  Resilient individuals are those who learn to cope withstress better” (Jew & Green, 1998, p. 675).     Several studies indicate that resilient young people appear to be characterized byhigher intelligence or problem solving skills than their peers who are not considered asresilient (Herrenkohl et al., 1994, Kandel et al., 1988, Masten et al., 1988, Seifer et al.,1992, Werner, 1989, cited in Fergusson & Lynskey, 1996).  Another factor that mayincrease resiliency in children is the nature of parent/child relationships.  The presence ofwarm, nurturant or supportive relationships with at least one parent may protect againstthe effects of family adversity.  There has also been evidence to suggest that earlytemperament and behavior may be related to resiliency to adversity.  Another source maybe peer relations, which may provide the support that eases the effects of hardships(Fergusson & Lynskey, 1996).     Some researchers suggest that the first ten years of a child's life are most favorable fordeveloping strong coping skills, but there is no set timeline for finding strength andresiliency.  People who cope well with adversity are able to ask for help from others ifthey do not have a strong family support system.  Setting goals and planning for thefuture is also a strong factor in dealing with adversity.  Believing in oneself andrecognizing one's strengths is important; you give yourself value and surround yourselfwith things that help you stabilize.  Finally, it is essential to actually recognize one's ownstrengths (Blum, 1998).     Murphy and Moriarty (1976, cited in Anthony & Cohler, 1987) conducted a study inwhich they found children to be “good copers.”  They were responsive in a variety ofways including good feelings about themselves; good insights into interpersonalsituations; realistic evaluations of the human and nonhuman environment; flexibility“with regard to means and ends,” integration in their thinking, feeling, and acting; andmarked intuition, originality, and creativity (p.16).     It should be noted that these children orient themselves rapidly to situations; theyperceive logically, they communicate without inhibition; they can allow others to getclose to them and reciprocate in a warm and friendly manner; and that they looked uponthemselves and what they did positively.  Their capacity to tolerate frustration, to handleanxiety, and to ask for help when they needed it set them apart from the more vulnerablechildren who coped poorly in all of these areas (Anthony & Cohler, 1987).     In a study conducted by Fergusson & Lynskey (1996), factors based on the literatureon resilient adolescents that are believed to be associated with resilience were included inthe analyses.  These factors include:  intelligence, attention deficit, conduct problems,anxiety/withdrawl, self esteem, novelty seeking, school enjoyment, interest in sports,close adult relationships, parental bonding, parental attachment, nature of homeenvironment, peer affiliations, and peer attachment.     Some of the results from this study are that resilient adolescents have higherintelligence than their peers, are less prone to early onset attention deficit behaviors, andhave high self-esteem.  It was also found that resilient adolescents reported significantlyhigher levels of paternal care and lower levels of maternal protection.     According to Anthony and Cohler (1987), resilience is also a function of age.“Certain coping capacities are important for preparing the groundwork of resilience,especially those related to the management of stimulation from the environment (p. 31).The origin of the difference between vulnerability and resilience may be difficult topredict.  Without thorough examination during infancy and early childhood, it iscomplicated to judge a person’s primary level of vulnerability and resilience independentof experience.  It is possible that one child in a family may be more resilient and lessvulnerable than a brother or sister.     Resilience involves comprehensive characteristics of the whole child.  “Input from theoutside to evoke resilience is not confined to physical comfort and restrictive love”(Anthony & Cohler, 1987, p. 95).  Children can facilitate resilience in their companions.Depending on the strengths of a child, different resources are activated in a givenoccasion.  “The resilient child is oriented toward the future, is living ahead, with hope”(p. 101).Resiliency Among Gay & Lesbian Individuals     Peer relationships are often unrewarding for gay adolescents.  Many gay adolescentsare isolated from their peers because they try to prevent the discovery of their sexualorientation.  It is extremely difficult for gay adolescents to find a positive, supportive peerenvironment because many organizations tend to fear lawsuits, loss of license, or beingaccused of “promoting” homosexuality (Radkowsky & Siegel, 1997).  They are morelikely to lose important supportive relationships, including those with parents, when theirsexual orientation is disclosed.  However, gay youth have shown the ability to use goodsocial skills in seeking out supportive relationships that boost their self-concept (Walker& Greene, cited in Anderson, 1998).     Many gay adolescents also fear rejection from the family if their sexual orientationbecomes known because family acceptance is important to them.  Parents are not likely tobe pleased to learn this about their child given society’s negative attitudes towardhomosexuality (Radkowsky & Siegel, 1997).  However, a study by Jordan & Deluty(1998) found that “the more widely a woman disclosed her sexual orientation the lessanxiety, greater positive affectivity, and greater self-esteem she reported” (p. 55).  Theself-disclosure may make it more possible to find support systems and thus lower anxiety.     In a study by Anderson (1998), it was discovered that there are both internal andexternal resources that assist gay male youths in managing a stressful period ofpsychosocial development which represented protective factors associated withresilience.  The young gay men in this study differed from other adolescents’development in a way that managing their identity and learning how to survive in ahostile social climate became a primary developmental task.  They experienced loving,constructive relationships with parents and caring others that prior to adolescenceestablished internal strengths of positive self-esteem.  There was indication of the abilityto seek out and use available social supports.     The external resources that assisted with managing a stressful period of psychosocialdevelopment were a greater than expected support from non-gay friends in adolescence,perceived social support of parents, and the added support of gay, lesbian, and bisexualfriends at a crucial point in their development.  Expanding cognitive abilities facilitatesthe management of their gay identity in constructive ways.  Not suspecting that theirchild could be gay, “parents provided the necessary supports to accomplish age-appropriate developmental tasks thus enabling them to enter adolescence with establishedstrengths to cope with their unique life crisis” (Anderson, 1998, p. 67).     Rutter (1985) suggested that by facing the adversity associated with their sexualorientation, gay youths in this study were forced to engage in an introspective processthat provided them with a better understanding of themselves, others, and society.  Theyalso developed crisis management skills that non-gay youth may not achieve until later inlife.     The social support of gay, lesbian, and bisexual friends gained in adolescence was animportant factor in their developmental process.  The gay youths in Anderson’s (1998)study demonstrated their social skills by seeking out supportive individuals and groups.The supportive individuals and groups allowed them to risk revealing their sexualorientation to parents and non-gay peers in an attempt to improve these relationships.  Bytaking these risks, many of these adolescents experienced levels of support from parentsand non-gay friends that they might not otherwise have known was available.     Savin-Williams (cited in Anderson, 1998) studied gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths in1990 and found them to possess positive self-esteem overall.  Those who perceived theirparents to be more accepting of their sexual orientation scored significantly higher on theself-esteem measure than did those who perceived their parents as less accepting.     Anderson (1998) found that gay male youths develop strengths that enable them tosuccessfully cope with the challenges and stresses associated with their overalldevelopment.  They perceived themselves to be strong and competent individuals whofelt good about themselves, had control over their lives, and had not internalized societalhomophobia to the point of becoming dysfunctional.  They viewed being gay as a sourceof strength and reframed their sexual orientation in a positive way.  They demonstratedadequate cognitive and social skills, which they used to their benefit.  They processedissues with friends individually and collectively within social support groups for gay,lesbian, and bisexual youth.Identity     Perhaps no single theoretician has had a greater impact on our perceptions of identitydevelopment than Erik Erikson.  He has provided a framework from which to observe thedevelopmental process of identity formation.  According to Erikson (1980), \"adolescencebecomes the relevant time in the life span to integrate past partial identifications into acohesive sense of self that is the accrued confidence that one's ability to maintain innersameness and continuity is matched by the sameness and continuity of one's meaning forothers\" (p. 94).     Since 1980, identity research has increasingly focused on female identity, resulting inan emerging female pattern which may not follow Erikson's eight-stage model.  Lytle,Bakken, and Romig (1997) found that adolescent females appear to be adapting to theneed for a broader identity that blends both dimensions of separation and connectedness,whereas adolescent males are not.     Jones (1997) asserts that theories of racial and gender identity development usuallyhave failed to include other identity dimensions.  There has been a lack of the existenceof multiple dimensions of identity.  Jones' study involved women college students andseveral aspects of identity relating to these women emerged.  First of all, the womenshared a sense that their identities consisted of multiple layers.  \"Identity was experiencedas evolving in an ongoing negotiation between the outside and inside worlds\" (pp. 380-381).     Gender was an identity dimension with which these women related.  The descriptionof what being female meant to them was connected with other dimensions (i.e., Blackwoman, Jewish woman, lesbian).  Identities were shaped by the various environments inwhich gender was experienced.    Many discussed the process of coming to definethemselves as individuals distinct from their parents and families without disregardingthe valued learned from them.  They spoke of their uniqueness, distinctiveness, andcommonality with others.     The women shared a belief in the value of developing connections and relationshipswith people different from themselves.  \"These women testified to the process ofsearching for identity and the complexities of this process.  The language of identityembraced by these women was one of movement, process, fluidity, searching, andongoing discovery\" (p. 383).  Multiple dimensions of who they were and who they wereto become were honored, reflected upon, and integrated into the self.Gay and Lesbian Identity Development     It is presumed that most young people are raised to believe that they are nothomosexual and are aware of society's negative view towards homosexuality.  Therefore,young people who may identify as gay/lesbian in the future are likely to experiment withother-sex partners and to strive for a bisexual identity (Rosario, Meyer-Bahlburg, Hunter,Exner, Gwadz, & Keller, 1996).  In the study conducted by Rosario et al. (1996), it wasfound that \"two thirds of youths (62%) who now identify as lesbian/gay had identified asbisexual in the past\" (p. 123).  The opposite was also found to be true.  Sixty percent ofthose who now identify as bisexual had identified as gay or lesbian in the past.  Thereasoning behind this suggests that because of the great stigma associated withhomosexuality, adolescents may find it too overwhelming to deal with and may try tohave the connection to heterosexuality.     Savin-Williams (cited in Rosario et al., 1996) found that there are no significantrelationships among sexual identity, age of awareness of sexual orientation, and age atinitiation of sexual activity among gay and bisexual young men in college.  In contrast toprevious research, the study by Rosario et al. (1996) found that male and femaleadolescents did not differ in the numbers who had ever had sexual activity with same-sexpartners nor did they differ in the ages when they fist experienced this.     The result of the coming-out process is said to be self-identification.  There aredifferent models that describe the coming out process along with different stages.  Theresults of a study by Vincke, DeRycke, and Bolton (1999) confirmed previous researchfindings in which depression resulted in low identity commitment.  It seems that gay mencope with lower levels of mental well-being following gay-related stress by lowering thecommitment to their being gay.  “If lowered identity commitment results from thenegative impact of identity-related stresses on depression, then it becomes difficult foridentity commitment buffer these stresses adequately” (p. 1328).     Bahr (cited in Meyer & Schwitzer, 1999) found that resolving sexual orientationissues took precedence over other developmental tasks for college students who were inthe process of developing a gay or lesbian identity.  Meyer and Schwitzer (1999)conducted a study in which they came up with a descriptive model that they constructedfrom their data.  This model contains six stages that tend to make up a student’s sexualidentity development for those who do not identify with a heterosexual orientation.  Theyfound these six stages to be:  1.)  Recognizing a Difference, 2.)  Reflective Observing, 3.)Internalizing Reflective Observations, 4.)  Self-Identifying, 5.)  Coming into Proximity,and 6.)  Networking and Connecting (p. 49).     In the first stage of recognizing a difference, the person may question the nature of theperceived differences from peers.  There may be a growing feeling of separation fromone’s peer group including feelings of anxiety, uneasiness, and confusion.  Reflectiveobserving, stage two, includes such traits as noticing characteristics in others that are of agay or lesbian sexual orientation, observing others’ beliefs and attitudes about ahomosexual orientation, and observing how this orientation is portrayed by the media.     The third stage of identity development among gay and lesbian sexual orientationcollege students is internalizing reflective observations.  This entails “makingintrapersonal observations with goal of fitting observations about others with experienceof self and developing growing recognition that difference from others is in area of sexualidentity” (p. 49).   Self-identifying, the fourth stage, consists of a more definite notice ofdifference in sexual identity and a more definite identification with a minority sexualorientation.     During the fifth stage, coming into proximity, there is an increase in closeness ofsimilar peers.  There may be intentional formations of friendships with peers of similarsexual orientation and an active seeking of sources of support.  The final stage isnetworking and connecting which involves developing broader friendships and beingmore involved in social, political, or support groups.  There is also a seeking of balancebetween establishing new relationships and maintaining ongoing relationships of family,peers, and community.     Meyer (1998, cited in Meyer & Schwitzer, 1999) found that the first two stages wereassociated with increased anxiety and confusion.  Identity development focused on therecognition of the differences between self and others.  \"In the middle two stages, identitydevelopment tended to center on internalizing and understanding one's own sexualorientation and its impact on one's self-concept.  Meyer found that there is an associationwith increased self-consciousness as well as increased resolution and comfort with self\"(p.56).  In the last two stages, identity development tended to center on \"integrating one'ssexual orientation into a more consolidated self-concept\" (p. 56).     The study by Meyer and Schwitzer (1999) confirmed many of the features of thisminority sexual identity stage-developmental model.  First it was found that all of theparticipants identified an age at which they noticed a difference in sexual orientationfrom peers; recognized others believed to be of a gay or lesbian orientation; beganinternalizing observations of others; began intentionally developing social relationshipswith those who identify as gay or lesbian; and, began developing social contacts in thecommunity.  It was also found that most moved through the stages in chronological order,but there was a wide variation in the age in which they entered a new stage and theamount of time spent in the stages.     According to Cass (1984), self-images become the basic unit upon which identity isbuilt.  “A composite identity is a person’s theory held about self with regard to socialsituations, and derives out of interaction with others” (p. 144).  A composite identity mayinclude typological identities.  These are organized sets of self-images and attachedfeelings that an individual holds about the self with regard to some social category ortype.  “These typological identities arise out of the synthesis of the individual’s ownperceptions of self with the individual’s own views of how others are believed to perceivethis aspect of self” (p. 144).     Homosexual identity is an example of a typological identity.  One’s view of the self asgay or lesbian is processed cognitively with images of sexual preference believed to beheld by others.  Where both types of images are in agreement, identity may be said toexist (Cass, 1984).     The following is a summary of the ideal stage descriptions indicating the broaddevelopmental changes that Cass believes occurs across stages and the variables that takeon significant importance in this process:  identity confusion; identity comparison;identity tolerance; identity acceptance; identity pride; and, identity synthesis.     During the first stage, identity confusion, individuals sense that their behavior(actions, feeling, thoughts) may be defined as homosexual.  This may bring out feelingsof confusion and the individual may choose to take different paths of development.  Theindividual may consider the possibility of a homosexual identity (accepting this aspositive or negative) or reject it entirely, thus the individual may choose to not to proceedany further in the development of a homosexual identity, which is defined as identityforeclosure.  Keep in mind that identity foreclosure can happen at any stage.     During stage two, identity comparison, the individual has accepted the potentiality ofa homosexual identity.  There may be feelings of alienation because the differencesbetween the individual and others who are not gay or lesbian become clearer.   If identityforeclosure does not occur, the individual may consider getting in contact with other gayand lesbian individuals to assist in lessening the alienation felt at this stage.     In stage three, identity tolerance, there is an increase of commitment to a homosexualself-image.  The individual looks for the companionship of other gay and/or lesbianindividuals in order to fulfill social, emotional, and sexual needs.  There are two possiblepaths of development.  The first path is taken by those who perceive a gay or lesbianidentity as desirable and the other by those who do not.  Disclosure to heterosexuals atthis point is extremely limited.     Stage four is identity acceptance.  There is an increased contact with the subculture ofgay and lesbian individuals which facilitates a more positive view of homosexuality and agradual development and expansion of a network of gay and lesbian friends.  Selectivedisclosure is made to others, particularly friends and relatives.  This stage may be a stabletime for the individual because the questions of “Who am I?” and “Where do I belong?”have been resolved.     During stage five, identity pride, there are feelings of pride towards one’s identity asgay or lesbian and a strong loyalty to gay and lesbian people as a group.  Disclosure is aproduct of anger about society’s stigmatization of gay and lesbian individuals.  There ismeaningful confrontation with heterosexuals in order to promote the equality of gay andlesbian people.     Finally, in the final stage of identity synthesis, anger and pride associated with theprevious stage are retained but in less emotional terms.  Individuals come to seethemselves as people having many sides to their character, only one part of which isrelated to homosexuality.  A lifestyle is developed in which the homosexual identity is nolonger hidden, so that disclosure becomes a non-issue.  “One view of self and views ofself believed to be held by others are therefore synthesized into one integrated identitythat unites both private and public aspects of self.  This gives rise to feelings of peace andstability.  With this, the process of identity formation is completed” (pp. 152-153).     According to Gonsiorek and Weinrich (1991), the coming out process represents ashift in the person's core sexual identity and may be accompanied by dramatic levels ofemotional distress.  Generally speaking, the best predictor of an individual's long-termadjustment is his or her level of functioning prior to this process.  Most gay and lesbianpeople endure this and transpire several years later with minimal or no symptomatologyand improved functioning.     There appears to be differences between gay men and lesbian women during thisprocess.  It appears that for males this process is more abrupt and more likely to beassociated with psychiatric symptoms.  This process appears to be more fluid for women.\"Because women are allowed a broader range of behavioral and emotional interactionswith other women, they may experience emerging sexual and emotional intimacy as merefriendship\" (p. 165).     Men tend to be restricted to more narrow patterns of expression and therefore desiringfor emotional and physical contact with other males is apt to be perceived as homosexual.\"Consistent with traditional sex role socialization, males are more likely to sexualizedistress during the coming out process and women are more likely to respond withreflection and self-absorption\" (p. 165).     Jordan and Deluty (1998) found that the more widely a woman disclosed her sexualorientation the less anxiety, greater positive affectivity, and greater self-esteem shereported.  Disclosure may enhance self-esteem and decrease anxiety by eliminating theneed for disguising an important part of one's life.  This may also assist the individual inlocating support systems, which may also lead to lower anxiety.  \"The degree ofdisclosure to family, gay and lesbian friends, straight friends, and co-workers wassignificantly related to overall level of social support\" (p. 57).  \"Being out\" to friends wasthe best predictor of overall social support.     Manodori (1998) examined the ways in which rituals help affirm lesbian identity.Two types of rituals were investigated that are commonly used among lesbian women.They are commitment ceremonies and baby naming or child dedication ceremonies.Lesbian rituals can help lesbians reconnect with their true or genuine selves by providingopportunities for them to re-tell their stories in a positive light (Laird, 1994, cited inManodori, 1998).  They call for the support of family, friends, and community, and theyvalidate the existence of a different way of life.  Most of all they affirm a relationshipwhich society has attempted to erase time and time again (Butler, 1990, cited inManodori, 1998).     All of the participants in Manodori's (1998) study claimed that in one way or another,their ritual helped them to confront homophobia.  Some of them also felt that the ritualhelped to confront other people's homophobic perceptions.  Others felt that the ritualhelped them reclaim something that had been denied to them because of their sexualorientation.  And yet others felt that this encouraged them to be more visible and genuinein the world, which re-integrated previously split off aspects of the self.  \"Lesbian ritualscan help balance the experiences of living with very real restrictions imposed on lesbiansby a prejudiced society and the ideals of being able to participate in the same ritualswhich heterosexual people participate\" (p. 53).     This chapter reviewed the literature relating to self-concept, resiliency, and identitydevelopment pertaining to gay and lesbian individuals.  In chapter three, this material willbe analyzed and conclusions drawn regarding the importance of these concepts.  Therewill also be implications for counselors in the mental health field, recommendations willbe made, and the necessity for future research will be addressed.Chapter IIICritique and Critical Analysis     From the review of literature, there are several important aspects about the self-concept, identity, and resiliency among gay and lesbian individuals that need to behighlighted and analyzed.  First of all, the stigmatization of homosexuality can make itdifficult for gay and lesbian youth to achieve the tasks of adolescence.  Peer acceptance,exploration of intimate relationships, individuation, and formation of a positive identitycan be hindered because these youth are generally taught to despise a very important partof themselves.  It can be very difficult for gay and lesbian adolescents to find a positive,supportive peer environment.     Many gay and lesbian adolescents fear rejection from the family if their sexualorientation becomes known because family acceptance is important to them.  Parents arenot likely to be pleased to learn this about their child given society’s negative attitudestoward homosexuality.  Counselors need to be aware and fully prepared to deal withissues of abandonment and feelings of loss, and with this loss comes grief.     There has been a vast amount of research done on identity development by Cass.  Shedescribes the stages of development changes and the important variables in this processamong gay and lesbian individuals.  These stages include:  identity confusion; identitycomparison; identity tolerance; identity acceptance; identity pride; and, identity synthesis.It would be helpful for counselors to be aware of these stages to assist in “meeting themwhere they are at.”  This could be a positive means to facilitate the therapeutic process.  Itcould be used to help the client understand and/or make more sense of where he/she is at.     The literature also points out that gay and lesbian youth have shown the ability to usegood social skills in seeking out supportive relationships that boost their self-concept.Resilient individuals are those who learn to cope with stress better.  The literatureindicates that resilient young people appear to be characterized by higher intelligence orproblem solving skills than their peers who are not considered as resilient.     It is important to be aware that another factor that may increase resiliency is the natureof parent/child relationships.  Also, people who cope well with adversity are able to askfor help from others if they do not have a strong family support system.  Yet anothersource may be peer relations, which may provide the support that eases the effects ofhardships.     Setting goals and planning for the future are strong factors in dealing with adversity.Counselors can help in the process of recognizing one’s strengths and to give value to theindividual.  In some cases, self-disclosure makes it more possible to find support systemsand thus lower anxiety.  Disclosure may enhance self-esteem and decrease anxiety byeliminating the need for disguising an important part of one’s life.  This may also assistthe individual in locating support systems, which may also lead to lower anxiety.     Through the analysis of the literature, it was found that there are tremendousimplications for mental health and school counselors.  Counselors can be an excellentsource of help for gay and lesbian individuals, but generally there are not enoughsufficiently trained counselors to deal with adolescents and self-concept, identity, andresilient aspects of their lives.  Additional training is needed not only for counselors, butalso for those in educational institutions (i.e., teachers).  They need to work together asteams and make themselves available for sources of support and have appropriateresources and referrals accessible.     Comprehensive counseling training programs should incorporate grief, abandonment,shame, and loss issues.  It is important for clinicians to approach gay and lesbian youthfrom a strengths perspective, identifying resources that can be utilized and built upon.Support groups can also be a great source of strength to facilitate this process.  Mentorsfor these adolescents can help them envision what someone looks like who is successfulin resiliency and identification.  It should also be noted that a spiritual framework can bea great source of strength for enhancing the spiritual sense of self.     Lastly, mental health counselors and school counselors need to recognize andunderstand the diversity among gay and lesbian individuals and their development.  Towork with this population successfully, counselors need to examine their beliefs andvalues about gay and lesbian people, to be comfortable with their own sexuality, and toeducate themselves as to what is means to be gay or lesbian.  There is the implication forcounselors to go through psychotherapy themselves and explore their own values, biases,stereotypes, and beliefs.Future Research     Future research should examine the importance of self-esteem and how this researchcan assist in designing interventions to enhance self-esteem.  Other strategies for copingwith life’s problems among those gay and lesbian individuals who have become resilientto the homophobia of society as well as among those who have difficulties in copingshould also be further addressed.  There was minimal research found relating to self-concept among gay and lesbian individuals.  This area also warrants further investigation.     Resilience is likely to be an outcome of several factors.  There is a need for studies ofresilience to examine the ways in which combinations of factors may act to influenceresilience.  Future studies should determine whether satisfaction with a specific type ofsupport (i.e., emotional, social parental, friend) is more effective in predicting emotionalstress than a single universal measure of satisfaction.  The possibility that greaterexposure to a group leads to more social support from that group and/or that greatersocial support leads to more disclosure should also be further explored.     Although disclosure may be important for obtaining and maintaining social support,other factors, such as the strength of the relationship prior to disclosure needs to beconsidered.  A study that examines the coming out process with those who are justbecoming aware of their sexual orientation could reveal patterns of adjustment,relationships, and social support.     Finally, the role of siblings in the coming out process should be looked at.  There is anabundance of research relating to parents and peers and the coming out of gay and lesbianadolescents, but it is lacking in relation to coming out and siblings.  Perhaps coming outto siblings before parents and being accepted by them can raise the comfort level beforeapproaching the parents.References     Anderson, A. L. (1998).
