Rosenkrantz 2018      ABSTRACT OF DISSERTATION FACTORS IMPACTING PARENTAL ACCEPTANCE OF AN LGBT CHILD Chrisler’s (2017) Theoretical Framework of Parental Reactions When a Child Comes Out as Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual suggests that parental reactions to having a non-heteronormative child are impacted by a process of cognitively appraising information about their child’s identity and experiencing and coping with emotional responses, both of which are influenced by contextual factors such as a parent’s value system. However, some religious values can challenge parents in the process of accepting a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) child.  The purpose of this study was to test a model that examines the influence of cognitive-affective factors (cognitive flexibility, emotional regulation), religious-value based factors (religious fundamentalism, parental sanctification), and gender and sexual identity on self-reported parental acceptance.  Participants were 663 parents of LGBT children who submitted responses to an online survey.  A Tobit regression with a single-indicator latent variable approach revealed that religious fundamentalism, parental sanctification, the control component of cognitive flexibility, parent gender, and parent sexual identity significantly predicted parental acceptance. Lower religious fundamentalism, higher parental sanctification, and higher cognitive flexibility scores were associated with parental acceptance of an LGBT child. Participants identifying as a woman or LGB parent also significantly predicted acceptance. Implications of findings are discussed.

Described as the “warmth” dimension of parenting, Rohner and colleagues define acceptance as “the warmth, affection, care, comfort, concern, nurturance, support, or simply love that children can experience from their parents” (p. 305).  Alternatively, parental rejection is considered “the absence or significant withdrawal of these feelings and behaviors and…the presence of a variety of physically and psychologically hurtful behaviors and emotions,” including hostility, aggression, indifference, and/or neglect (Rohner, Khaleque, & Cournoyer, 2005, p. 305).   The view that children’s functioning is influenced by experiences of acceptance or rejection has been empirically supported in research with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) children and their parents.  According to research by the Family Acceptance Project, having rejecting parents places LGB children at risk for depression and suicide (Ryan, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2009), whereas having parents who are accepting of their child’s LGBT identity can serve as a protective factor that supports well-being (Ryan, Russell, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2010).  Positive responses from parents have been associated with better emotional adjustment (e.g., Darby-Mullins & Murdock, 2008; D'Amico, Julien, Tremblay, & Chartrand, 2015), positive identity (e.g., Bregman, Malik, Page, Makynen, & Lindahl, 2013; Mohr & Fassinger, 2003), and higher self-esteem (Ryan, Russell, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2010; Snapp, Watson, Russell, Diaz, & Ryan, 2015).  Better mental health (e.g., Dickenson & Huebner, 2015; D'Augelli, 2002) and general health (Ryan, Russell, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2010) outcomes have also been associated with parental support.  In contrast, negative reactions have been related to substance abuse and sexual risk-taking behaviors (e.g., D'Amico & Julien, 2012;           2  Padilla, Crisp, & Rew, 2010), in addition to fear of disclosure and internalized stigma (D’amico, Julien, Tremblay & Chartrand, 2015).   LGB children are disclosing their identities to their parents at younger ages, elongating their time of in-home exposure to parental reactions to their sexual identity (Grov, Bimbi, NaníN, & Parsons, 2006; Ryan, 2003).  Similarly, the limited research exploring transgender identity awareness and disclosure suggests that transgender children become aware of their identity in early childhood and disclose before adulthood (Grossman & D'Augelli, 2006; Grossman, D'Augelli, Howell, & Hubbard, 2006).  Coming out at younger ages can be a positive experience for children in supportive homes, but can also be increasingly negative for children with parents who are not accepting.  The evidenced high costs of parental rejection and benefits of parental acceptance necessitate understanding factors that influence parental acceptance of an LGBT child.  Thus, the purpose of my study is to test a theoretically driven model of parental acceptance that has implications for interventions.  Religiosity and Parental Acceptance/Rejection  To date, the literature on parental acceptance is comprised primarily of research focusing either on children’s perceptions of acceptance/rejection or parents’ qualitative narratives of their acceptance processes post-disclosure (Bouris et al., 2010; Rosenkrantz et al., 2017).  Within child and parent samples, religiosity, a connection and commitment to a religious tradition, has been identified as a factor that can be particularly challenging for many parents in the process of finding acceptance.  For example, in a sample of 245 LGBT young adult children, Ryan, Russell, Huebner, Diaz, and Sanchez (2010) found that family religiosity (indicated by responses to the question “how religious or spiritual was your family growing up?”) significantly predicted less perceived parental acceptance (correlation not reported).  In another study of 310 Seventh-day Adventist adult Millennials, 82.4% of participants reported that religious beliefs led to difficulty in their parents accepting their LGBT identities (VanderWaal, Sedlacek, & Lane, 2017).  One psychometric evaluation study of the Heterosexism Scale (Park, 2001) found that religiosity,           3  defined as an individual’s commitment to their religious tradition, was associated with heterosexist superiority in a sample of  441 parents of LGB children (r = 0.09; Goodrich, Selig, & Crofts, 2014).  In a recent online qualitative survey of 314 LGBT identified individuals, participants reported struggling with negative experiences in conservative religious families and communities of origin (Rosenkrantz, Rostosky, Riggle, & Cook, 2016).   Qualitative explorations from the perspective of parents of LGBT children reflect similar tensions.  Based on preliminary findings from a review of the parental acceptance literature with parent samples from 1990-2016 (Rosenkrantz et al., 2017), approximately 34 qualitative explorations have inquired about the experiences of parents after their child’s disclosure of an LGBT identity.  Across these qualitative studies, many parents share more complex and nuanced experiences in reconciling tensions between having an LGBT child and their religious beliefs (Bertone & Franchi, 2014; Broad, 2011; Freedman, 2008; Goodrich, 2009; Lee & Lee, 2006; Maslowe & Yarhouse, 2015; Oswald, 2000; Pearlman, 2005; Phillip & Ancis, 2008; Tyler, 2015).  Some parents state that they accept their LGBT child, but not their child’s sexual identity (e.g., Bertone & Franchi, 2014; Freedman, 2008).  Others report that they reject anti-gay doctrines of religious institutions (e.g., the Catholic Church) but still identify with local communities (e.g., Bertone & Franchi, 2014; Pearlman, 2005).  In a semi-structured interview study of 202 self-identified Christian parents that examined parent experiences of religious support from their Church communities, 49.5% reported experiencing negative responses from other church members and 36.4% reported being advised to pray for an orientation change (Sides, 2017).  Parents also describe changing faith beliefs or moving away from beliefs such as “being gay is a choice” to feeling their child was born LGBT (e.g., Bertone & Franchi, 2014; Freedman, 2008).  In addition to findings indicating the challenges religion can generate for parents in the process of acceptance, the literature also indicates that religion can be a positive source of strength for parents adjusting to their new realities as parents of LGBT children.  Parents report using religious resources including prayer, supportive clergy, and affirming faith communities           4  during the process of acceptance (e.g., Freedman, 2008; Maslowe & Yarhouse, 2015; Pearlman, 2005; Sides, 2017).  Moreover, a validation study of a model of family functioning post sexual orientation disclosure found that religiosity, defined as religious commitment and measured with the Religious Commitment Inventory-10 (Worthington et al., 2003) was associated with higher family functioning, defined as the parent’s reported levels of general family functioning and measured with the General Functioning Subscale of the Family Assessment Device (Epstein, Baldwin, & Bishop, 1983), in a sample of 440 parents of LGB children (Goodrich & Gilbride, 2010).  Together, these findings support Tyler’s (2015) assertion that religiosity is a complex factor in the relational process between parents and their LGBT child post-disclosure.   The above literature paints a picture of a nuanced relationship between parental religiosity and acceptance; religious parents may struggle with accepting their LGBT child because of religious tensions and use religious resources as sources of strength and motivation during the acceptance process.  This complex relationship, as well as the potential increased risk of harm to LGBT youth when exposed to unaccepting family environments (see review by Bouris et al., 2010), necessitates theoretically driven model testing that builds on previous studies and moves our understanding forward in ways that support intervention.   Theoretical Framework Chrisler’s (2017) Theoretical Framework of Parental Reactions When a Child Comes Out as Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual offers a useful framework for considering factors that influence parental acceptance of an LGBT child.  Chrisler’s theory suggests that parents’ reactions are impacted by a process of cognitively appraising and reappraising information about their child’s non-heteronormative identity in addition to experiencing and coping with emotional responses, both of which are influenced by contextual factors such as a parent’s value system.  Consistent with this conceptualization are four cognitive-affective and religious value-based factors that may help explain the relationship between religiosity and acceptance in parents of LGBT children: cognitive flexibility, emotional regulation, religious fundamentalism, and parental sanctification.            5  Cognitive-affective factors. As suggested by Chrisler’s (2017) theory, parents across multiple qualitative studies describe cognitive-affective components in their acceptance process.  For example, many parents describe changes in their perspectives (e.g., Bertone & Franchi, 2014; Fields, 2001; Gonzalez, Rostosky, Odom, & Riggle, 2013) and moving through intense emotional reactions (e.g., Fields, 2001; Grafsky, 2014).  These narratives suggest two cognitive-affective factors that may contribute to parental acceptance of an LGBT child: cognitive flexibility and emotional regulation.  Cognitive flexibility. Dennis and Vander Wal (2010) define cognitive flexibility as “the ability to switch cognitive sets to adapt to changing environmental stimuli” (p. 242).  According to Ionescu (2012), this “switching of cognitive sets” can refer to different behavior changes, including “changing behavior in light of a new rule, finding a new solution to a problem, and creating new knowledge or tools” (p. 191).  Ionescu notes that cognitive flexibility is often contrasted with rigidity of thought, resistance to change, and overall consistency in behavior.  For parents of LGBT children, cognitive flexibility may involve creative problem solving and navigating tensions between a connection to religious traditions espousing heteronormative views of sexuality and gender and a desire to maintain connection with their LGBT child.  Cognitive flexibility could also help parents to engage in behavior change toward their child while still processing their own reactions and conflicts.  Research with parents of LGBT children supports the exploration of cognitive flexibility in the parental acceptance process.  In qualitative projects, parents report working to change their perspectives, describe increased critical thinking, and endorse changes in their ideas of parenting and beliefs about sexual identity during the acceptance process (e.g., Bertone & Franchi, 2014; Fields, 2001; Gonzalez, Rostosky, Odom, & Riggle, 2013).  To date, two studies have assessed cognitive flexibility in samples of parents of LGBT children.  However, these studies focus on associations between cognitive flexibility and parent perceptions of their family’s functioning (e.g., ability to work together and communicate, Goodrich & Gilbride, 2010) and heterosexism           6  (Goodrich, Selig, & Crofts, 2014), rather than acceptance.  In a sample of 440 parents of LGB children, Goodrich and Gilbride tested a model that examined associations between nine explanatory variables, including cognitive flexibility as indicated by the Cognitive Flexibility Scale (Martin & Rubin, 1995), and the outcome variable, family functioning as indicated by the General Functioning Subscale of the Family Assessment Device (Epstein, Baldwin, & Bishop, 1983).  Cognitive flexibility was reported to be a significant predictor of family functioning (standardized β = .08) and was noted to be one of the largest contributors to the overall explained variance (overall model R2 = .57).  Cognitive flexibility also was reported to mediate the relationships between three variables in the model (parents’ initial emotional experiences post-disclosure, parents’ choice to honor the needs of their child or themselves regarding disclosure decisions, and religiosity) and family functioning.  Religiosity was measured using the Religious Commitment Inventory by Worthington et al. (2003), which examines intrapersonal and interpersonal commitment to religious belief.  The finding that cognitive flexibility mediated the relationship between religiosity and family functioning suggests that cognitive flexibility may be an important skill for religious parents in developing acceptance.    Using the same data set, Goodrich, Selig, and Crofts (2014) examined the factor structure of Park’s (2001) Heterosexism Scale and assessed the relationship between the measure’s two subscales (Superiority and Tolerance) and measures of cognitive flexibility, religiosity, and family functioning.  Lower scores on cognitive flexibility and higher scores on religiosity were significantly associated with heterosexist superiority (r =.09), but not with tolerance (r = .06).  The authors interpreted these findings to suggest that while more religious and more cognitively inflexible people tend to have more superior heterosexist attitudes, the relationship between these variables and tolerance require further investigation (Goodrich et al., 2014).  Tolerance is different from acceptance, and to date, no published studies have directly examined associations between cognitive flexibility and parental acceptance.             7  Emotional regulation. According to Gratz and Roemer (2004), emotional regulation can be defined as:  (a) awareness and understanding of emotions, (b) acceptance of emotions, (c) ability to control impulsive behaviors and behave in accordance with desired goals when experiencing negative emotions, and (d) ability to use situationally appropriate emotion regulation strategies flexibly to modulate emotional responses as desired in order to meet individual goals and situational demands. The relative absence of any or all of these abilities would indicate the presence of difficulties in emotion regulation, or emotion dysregulation (pp. 42-43).  Emotional regulation may help parents of LGBT children to self-soothe more effectively and work toward problem solving rather than being “stuck” in their intense emotional reactions.  No studies have assessed emotional regulation skills in relation to acceptance; however, parents have described intense emotions and how they processed them (e.g., Fields, 2001; Grafsky, 2014), and recent interventions have focused on helping parents with emotion regulation (e.g., Lead with Love, Huebner, Rullo, Thoma, McGarrity, & Mackenzie, 2013; Family Acceptance Project, Ryan & Rees, 2012).  Additionally, Goodrich and Gilbride’s (2010) assessment of a model of family functioning found that the intensity and type of emotions (i.e., anger vs. surprise) parents reported at the time of disclosure predicted family functioning, such that higher intensity of emotions related to less flexible thinking (standardized β = -. 13) and poorer family functioning scores (standardized β = -. 17).  These findings suggest that emotion regulation skills may be associated with the parental acceptance process.  Religious value-based factors. According Ryan and colleagues (2010), scores on a one-item measure of family religiosity were found to be significantly associated with lower levels of acceptance.  While important, the use of a one-item measure limits our understanding of the impact of religiosity on the parental acceptance process.  As described by Pargament, Mahoney, Exline, Jones, and Shafrankse (2013), religion is a complex construct consisting of a variety of           8  components.  A lack of specificity obscures understanding of religious diversity; this may be particularly important considering the diverse views of sexuality and gender across the liberal to fundamentalist religious spectrum.  Such diversity requires a more nuanced assessment of religiosity’s effect on acceptance.  Two religious value-based constructs may offer a more complete understanding of ways religiosity may hinder and facilitate parental acceptance: religious fundamentalism and parental sanctification.  Religious fundamentalism. Providing the ability to discern difference between religious individuals following liberal vs. conservative religious traditions, religious fundamentalism has been defined as:  The belief that there is one set of religious teachings that contains the fundamental, basic, intrinsic, inerrant truth about humanity and deity; that this essential truth is opposed to evil which must be actively fought; that this truth must be followed today according to the fundamental practices of the past; and that those who follow these fundamental teachings have a special relationship with the deity (Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 1992, p.118).   Some religious parents may experience increased difficulty in the acceptance process if they identify with a faith tradition that emphasizes strict adherence to fundamentalist religious tenets, particularly those related to sexuality and gender, as the way to maintain a relationship with a higher power and protect against evil.   No research to date has examined religious fundamentalism in parents of LGBT children; however, research with parents (child identities not specified, r  = .57; Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 2004) and with general and college population samples found associations between religious fundamentalism and measures of negative feelings towards non-heterosexuals (r  = .51; Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 2004; see meta-analysis by Whitley, 2009).  In addition to homophobia, religious fundamentalism demonstrated moderate to strong positive associations with measures of right-wing authoritarianism and dogmatism in samples of 424 parents and 352           9  undergraduate students (parent sample r = .72 and student sample r = .79 for right-wing authoritarianism; parent sample r = .70 and student sample r = .75 for dogmatism; Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 2004).  Moreover, in a study of 198 undergraduates, religious fundamentalism and avoidance were significantly related (r = -.37, Schwartz, & Lindley, 2005).  Together, these findings suggest that religious fundamentalism may be associated with the parental acceptance process. Parental sanctification. In light of the positive religious resources described in parent narratives (e.g., Freedman, 2008; Maslowe & Yarhouse, 2015; Pearlman, 2005), a consideration of the impact of positive components of religiosity on parental acceptance, such as parental sanctification, is important.  Sanctification is defined as the process through which secular aspects of life are attributed spiritual, divine importance, character, and meaning (Mahoney, 2013; Pargament & Mahoney, 2005).  In the context of the parent-child relationship, parental sanctification involves imbuing the parental relationship with divine qualities, such that maintenance and preservation of the parent-child relationship becomes a spiritual task (Mahoney, 2010).  For some, sanctification can include the belief that one’s higher power is manifested in the parent-child relationship (theistic sanctification), while for others sanctification is simply about a relationship having spiritual value (nontheistic sanctification, Mahoney, Pargament, Murray-Swank & Murray-Swank, 2013).  Some religious parents may draw on these understandings of their parenting role when faced with difficulty in the parent-child relationship.  Parental sanctification might motivate parents to prioritize preservation of their holy relationship with their child rather than prioritizing religious-based negative beliefs about LGBT identity.  While no published study of parents of LGBT individuals to date has examined this construct, qualitative reports suggest that demonstrating religious values such as “unconditional love” are important for some parents in the parental acceptance process (e.g., Bertone & Franchi, 2014; Freedman, 2008; Maslowe & Yarhouse, 2015).  Additionally, recent religiously-oriented           10  intervention work has focused on helping parents draw connections to religious tenets supporting the divine importance of the parent-child bond (Ryan & Rees, 2012).   Collectively, these two cognitive-affective and religious-value based variables may contribute to parental acceptance in important ways.  Understanding these relationships may provide empirical support for Chrisler’s theory and thus expand the literature on parental acceptance processes.  The Present Study Based on Chrisler’s (2017) theory and previous empirical studies reviewed above, the current study examined two cognitive-affective factors (cognitive flexibility, emotional regulation) and two religious value-based factors (religious fundamentalism, parental sanctification) and associations with self-reported parental acceptance of an LGBT child. Additionally, given Chrisler’s emphasis on contextual factors and prior research suggesting gender differences in parental acceptance amongst cisgender parents (Chung, 2017; Conley, 2011; D’Amico et al., 2015, Kuvalanka, Weiner, & Mahan, 2014; Riggs, & Due, 2015), parent gender and sexual identity were also examined.  New understanding of the specific contribution of psychological and religiosity-related skills, beliefs, and characteristics that affect the parental acceptance process expands current understanding of the parental acceptance process in ways that can aid intervention.   Based on the literature reviewed, the aim of my study was to answer the following primary research question: What is the association between the outcome variable, self-reported parental acceptance, and the explanatory variables cognitive flexibility, emotional regulation, religious fundamentalism, parental sanctification, and parent gender and sexual identity?  In addition to the theory-driven hypothesis 1 below, several exploratory hypotheses were developed to examine interactions between the explanatory variables (hypotheses 2-6 below).  Drawing on Chrisler’s Theoretical Framework of Parental Reactions When a Child Comes Out as Lesbian,           11  Gay, or Bisexual, as well as the previous literature on parental acceptance, the following hypotheses were examined:   Hypothesis 1: The set of explanatory variables (emotional regulation, cognitive flexibility, religious fundamentalism, parental sanctification, parent gender, and sexual identity) will contribute significantly to the explanation of variability in parental acceptance. It is expected that lower religious fundamentalism, higher emotional regulation, cognitive flexibility, parental sanctification, and identification as a woman and sexual minority will be associated with greater parental acceptance.  Hypothesis 2: The influence cognitive flexibility has on parental acceptance will change based on level of religious fundamentalism. It is expected that lower religious fundamentalism and higher cognitive flexibility will result in higher parental acceptance. Hypothesis 3: The influence cognitive flexibility has on parental acceptance will change based on level of parental sanctification. It is expected that higher parental sanctification and higher cognitive flexibility will result in higher parental acceptance. Hypothesis 3: The influence emotional regulation has on parental acceptance will change based on level of religious fundamentalism. It is expected that lower religious fundamentalism and higher emotional regulation will result in higher parental acceptance. Hypothesis 4: The influence emotional regulation has on parental acceptance will change based on level of parental sanctification. It is expected that higher parental sanctification and higher emotional regulation will result in higher parental acceptance. Hypothesis 6: The influence parental sanctification has on parental acceptance will change based on level of religious fundamentalism. It is expected that higher parental sanctification and lower religious fundamentalism will result in higher parental acceptance.             12  Chapter 2: Method Participants  An initial sample of 687 self-identified parents of LGBT children submitted responses to an online survey.  Due to the small number of parents representing non-cisgender identities (1.8%), only parents who identified as cisgender were included in analyses.  Eight influential outliers were also removed (see details in Data Cleaning section of the Data Analysis Plan).  This resulted in a final sample of 663 parents of LGBT children.  Table 2.1 provides participant demographic characteristics and parent reported child demographic characteristics. . Parents ranged in age from 25 to 85 years (M = 51.75, SD = 10.45) and identified being from 48 of the 50 United States (missing from South Dakota and Montana) and 14 countries (Australia, Bosnia, Canada, England, France, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden, the United States, and Wales .  Parents reported their children’s ages as between 3 and 58 (M = 21.89, SD = 8.96).  While age three may appear to be an unusually young child age for parents to identify as a parent of an LGBT child , Grossman, D'Augelli, Howell, and Hubbard (2006) suggest that age three is when children begin to state their pronouns, verbally indicating their identification with a gender identity which may not align with the sex assigned at birth; Therefore, these parents were retained in the sample.  About fifty-eight percent of parents identified their child as a cisgender sexual minority and 42.1% identified their child as non-cisgender.   Participant Recruitment   All of the following procedures were officially approved by the university Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to commencing the study.  In light of the sensitivity of this subject matter and concerns about recruitment of a population with members who may be uncomfortable identifying themselves as the parent of an LGBT child, purposive and snowball sampling was used.  Parents were recruited between January to March 2017 from a variety of sources following           13  the plan of Goodrich et al. (2010).  As Goodrich and colleagues report, four groups needed to be targeted in order to capture the widest range of perspectives:  §   openly LGBT supportive groups, both secular (i.e., PFLAG, LGBT community and youth centers) and religious, with a range of conservatism (i.e., Keshet, a more reform Jewish organization and Eshel, an orthodox Jewish organization); §   unaccepting groups such as those that support conversion therapies (i.e., Focus on the Family, American Family Association);  §   ethnic minority LGBT groups that are often not represented in the literature (i.e., Reach LA); and §   religious groups unaffiliated with LGBT issues.  An initial goal of 400 parents was set based on the sample size achieved by Goodrich and colleagues (2010).  Parents were contacted through postings on online forums including websites, social media pages, and email listservs.  Groups were asked to forward a recruitment email that included a link to the survey.  This recruitment plan was designed to reduce score restrictions on measures and most adequately sample this population.  See Appendix A for recruitment materials. Procedure Prior to sending out the survey link, the survey was piloted amongst a team of trained researchers with content knowledge of LGBT issues and survey research methodology.  After incorporating feedback, the survey was finalized and shared via the participant recruitment procedures above.  To incentivize participation, all participants were offered the opportunity to enter a random drawing for one of four $25 Amazon gift cards. A raffle database was used to store provided emails separately from survey responses. When participants clicked on the survey link, they were taken to a welcome page that included an informed consent page.  Once parents acknowledged consent, they were asked for basic demographic information about parent gender, sexual identity, race, socioeconomic status,           14  education level, and religious group identification.  Current age and gender of their LGBT child were also requested.  Additionally, parents were asked to answer the prompt: “How long have you known your child is LGBT?”  After providing information on demographics, participants were presented with measures for the five constructs of interests, below.   Measures Parental acceptance instrument. Due to the limited measurement tools available to assess self-reported parental acceptance of an LGBT child, parental acceptance was assessed using a 39-item Parental Acceptance scale (PA) created by the author.  Item development was informed by the Family Acceptance Project’s suggestions of accepting and rejecting behaviors (Ryan & Rees, 2012). Table 2.2 details all 39 items and the specific source they were adapted from.  The scale also included items adapted from The Parental Acceptance of Sexual Orientation Scale (Freedman, 2008) and global measures of parental acceptance and rejection by Rohner and Khaleque (2005).  Parents were asked how often they engage in specific behaviors on a 4-point likert scale, ranging from 1 (always true) to 4 (never true).  Sample behaviors included “I participate/attend LGBT events to support my child.” and “I support my child’s LGBT identity even though I may feel uncomfortable.”  Higher scores indicate greater parental acceptance. Internal consistency of reliability was α = .77 and ω = .80 for this sample.  Cognitive flexibility instrument. Cognitive flexibility was operationalized using the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory scale (CFIS, Dennis & Vander Wal, 2010).  The CFIS is a 20-item measure with 7-point likert response options ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree).  The CFIS consists of an Alternatives subscale (CFIS-A) and a Control subscale (CFIS-C).  It assesses “(a) the tendency to perceive difficult situations as controllable, (b) the ability to perceive multiple alternative explanations for life occurrences and human behavior, and (c) the ability to generate multiple alternative solutions to difficult situations” (Dennis & Vander Wal, 2010, p. 243).  Sample items include: “I try to think about things from another person’s point of view” and “When I encounter difficult situations, I feel like I am losing control.”  Scores           15  on the CFIS have demonstrated evidence for validity of the instrument based on internal structure  (α = .90).  Bivariate correlations conducted between two time points provided evidence for test-retest reliability over a 7-week time period (r = .81).  Additionally, evidence for convergent construct validity of CFIS scores was demonstrated by significant positive correlations with Martin and Rubin’s (1995) Cognitive Flexibility Scale (r ranged from .73 to .75 at different time points).  Additionally, evidence for concurrent criterion validity of CFIS scores was demonstrated by significant inverse correlations with Beck, Steer, Ball, and Ranieri’s (1996) Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (r ranged from -.35 to -.39 at different time points).  Higher scores indicate higher levels of flexibility and the normative sample consisted of non-clinical adult undergraduates.  Internal consistency of reliability was α = .87 and ω = .88 for the CFIS-A and α = .81 and ω = .81 for CFIS-C for this sample.    Emotional regulation instrument. Emotional regulation was measured using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS, Gratz & Roemer, 2004).  The DERS is a 36-item measure with 5-point likert response options ranging from 1 (almost never [0-10%]) to 5 (almost always [91-100%]).  It assesses emotional dysregulation with six subscales: 1) non-acceptance of emotional responses, 2) difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, 3) impulse control difficulties, 4) lack of emotional awareness, 5) limited access to emotional regulation strategies, and 6) lack of emotional clarity.  Sample items include: “When I’m upset, I feel out of control” and “When I’m upset, my emotions feel overwhelming.”  Lower scores typically indicate lower emotional regulation skills for this measure; however, for the purposes of this study, the scale was reverse coded so that higher scores would equal higher emotional regulation. Scores on the DERS have been found to have high internal consistency (α = .93) and strong test–retest reliability over a period of 4-8 weeks.  Acceptable construct and predictive validity has also been demonstrated (Gratz & Roemer, 2004).  The DERS was normed on a non-clinical adult sample of undergraduates and has been applied in a sample of racially and socioeconomically diverse parents. Scores on the DERS have demonstrated strong evidence for validity of the           16  instrument based on internal structure (α = .94, Buckholdt, Parra, & Jobe-Shields, 2014).  Internal consistency of reliability was α = .94 and ω = .95 for this sample.  Religious fundamentalism instrument. Religious fundamentalism was operationalized using the Revised Religious Fundamentalism Scale (RFS, Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 2004).  The RFS (Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 2004) includes 12-items assessing attitudes toward religious beliefs across religious traditions.  The RFS was originally designed with 9-point likert response options ranging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 9 (very strongly agree), but has been given with 7-point ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) and 5-point scales ranging from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree); Asp, Ramchandran, & Tranel, 2012; James, Griffiths, & Pedersen, 2011).  A 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) was used for this study.  Sample items include: “God has given humanity a complete, unfailing guide to happiness and salvation, which must be totally followed” and “no single book of religious teachings contains all the intrinsic, fundamental truths about life.”  Higher scores indicate higher levels of religious fundamentalism.  The normative samples comprised of university students and parents; scores on the RFS have demonstrated strong evidence for validity of the instrument based on internal structure (α = .91, .92, respectively), as well as evidence for construct validity of the RFS scores based on positive correlations with related measures (Right Wing Authoritarianism Scale by Altemeyer [1999],  r ranged from .72- .79; Dogmatism Scale by Altemeyer [1996], r ranged from .70-.75; Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 2004).  Evidence for discriminant validity of RFS scores was also demonstrated, based on a negative correlation with a measure of religious doubt (Religious Doubt Scale by Altemeyer and Hunsberger [1997], r = - .44; Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 2004).  Internal consistency of reliability was α = .94 and ω = .94 for this sample. Parental sanctification instrument. Parental sanctification was measured using a modified Manifestation of God in Parenting Scale (MGP, Murray-Swank et al. 2006).  The MGP is a 14-item measure with 7-point likert scale ranging from ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).  Sample items include: “God is present in my role as a parent” and “Being a           17  parent is a calling from God.”  Scores on the MGP have been found to have a strong internal consistency (α = .98) and convergent validity.  It was normed on a sample of mothers. Internal consistency of reliability was α = .98 and ω = .98 for this sample. Demographic variables. In addition to these five constructs, demographic information for parent gender and sexual identity was collected.  In light of the removal of non-cisgender parents from analyses due to the small sample size, parent gender was coded as 0 = cisgender woman and 1 = cisgender man.  Additionally, parent sexual identity was coded as 0 = LGB identity and 1 = Heterosexual identity. Data Analysis Plan Data cleaning. Data cleaning procedures included handling of missing data and removal of outliers.  Several missing data patterns were observed at the scale and item level.  At the scale level, 18 patterns were observed and 516 participants completed all measures.  A range of patterns were also noted at the item level across variables.  On the Parental Acceptance instrument, 20 missing data patterns were noted, and 546 participants completed all items.  Nine missing data patterns were observed on the Cognitive Flexibility Instrument and 635 participants completed all items.  For the Emotional Regulation Instrument, 35 missing data patterns were noted, and 559 participants completed all questions.  Parental Sanctification instrument items were fully completed by 644 participants, and 15 patterns of missingness were observed.  Finally, Religious Fundamentalism instrument items were fully completed by 603 participants and 11 missing data patterns were noted.  Missing data were handled by applying full information maximum likelihood estimation in Mplus using the maximum likelihood robust (MLR) estimator and participant age as an auxiliary correlate (Graham, Taylor, Olchowski, & Cumsille, 2006).  Both MLR and weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimation were considered due to the presence of likert scale data and the presence of missing data. While WLSMV has an increased ability at handling categorical data, MLR was chosen due to its ability to handle data with missingness. Therefore, data were           18  treated as continuous.  Review of the data also indicated the presence of eight influential outliers which were removed prior to analyses.  Each scale was examined individually and multivariate outliers were identified using Mahalanobis distance based on all the items (De Maesschalck, Jouan-Rimbaud, & Massart, 2000). Extremely Mahalanobis distance cases were sequentially examined and response sequences were reviewed for validity (e.g., random responding).  Two cases were removed after review of the Religious Fundamentalism instrument based on validity concerns based on both cases responding strongly agreed to all items, including those that were reverse coded.  Outliers were also reviewed in the Main Effects Regression results, and influential outliers were identified using Cook’s distance (Stevens, 1994).  Six cases were removed due to the undue influence they exhibited over the parameter estimates.  Preliminary analyses. Prior to conducting the primary analyses, dimensionality analyses, as well as sample statistics review and assumption checking, were conducted.  Psychometrics dimensionality analyses. A series of factor analyses were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of scores generated from all five measures in assessing their intended constructs and to identify the best items to represent the constructs to be used in the primary analyses.  A typical procedure when conducting Structural Equation Modeling is to assess the dimensionality of the instruments to be used in the model are behaving as intended in the current sample as developed and proposed in previous literature (Kline, 2016). Therefore, psychometric dimensionality analyses were conducted.  For exploratory factor analyses (EFA), the scree procedure, and O’Conner’s (2000) parallel analysis based on Pearson correlation coefficients were performed to evaluate the number of factors to retain.  Theory, previous research, and interpretability were also considered to ascertain the number of factors to retain.  Items were assessed to ensure all items loaded distinctively on one factor and identified for possible removal if loadings were below .5 or had problematic cross-loadings (e.g., an item with a loading of .5 or higher on one factor and .1 or higher on a second factor).  Absolute standardized item residuals           19  were also examined and values above .1 (Kline, 2016) were flagged for removal in order to find the most parsimonious solution (i.e., inspect local fit).  Both loading and residual based-removals were done iteratively starting with the largest issues.  For confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs), overall model fit was assessed by review of Chi-Square (c2), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker Lewis index (TLI), Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA).  The following benchmarks were used as a guide to determine acceptable fit: the c2 MLR (good fit indicated by insignificant result at a .05 threshold; Barrett, 2007; Hooper, Coughlan, & Mullen, 2008), CFI (conservative CFI ≥ .95, liberal CFI ≥ .90; Hu & Bentler, 1999; Hooper, Coughlan, & Mullen, 2008), TLI (conservative TLI ≥ .95, liberal TLI ≥ .80; Hu & Bentler, 1999; Hooper, Coughlan, & Mullen, 2008), SRMR (conservative SRMR ≤ .05, liberal SRMR ≤ .08; Hooper, Coughlan, & Mullen, 2008), and RMSEA (conservative RMSEA ≤ .06, liberal RMSEA ≤ .10; Hooper, Coughlan, & Mullen, 2008, Hu & Bentler, 1999; MacCallum et al, 1996).  Additionally, local fit was investigated using residual correlations between item pairs with a threshold of .1 for concern (Kline, 2016) and .2 as being unacceptable (Morizot, Ainsworth, & Reise, 2007).  Internal consistency was calculated for all measures using both the traditional alpha as well as omega due to debate regarding the accuracy of alpha as a metric for reliability (Zinbarg, Yovel, Revelle, & McDonald, 2006).  Sample statistics and assumption checking. Normality, bivariate correlations, and collinearity assessments were conducted for all study variables.  Histograms of individual scores on each scale were examined and summary statistics computed to identify major concerns with non-normality.  Correlations amongst scores on study scales and multicollinearity statistics were examined to assess relationships among variables.  Multicollinearity was assessed using the Variance Inflation Factor  (VIF) and Tolerance as indicators of problematic correlations (VIF threshold of 10 or more, Tolerance threshold of .1 or less; Berk, 1977; Craney & Surles, 2002; Marquardt, 1970).           20  Primary regression analyses. Tobit regressions were conducted to evaluate the contribution of the variables of interest and their interactions to parental acceptance of an LGBT child.  Tobit regression is a regression technique used to account for data censoring (i.e., skew of scores toward an extreme) through adjustment of the standard errors and point estimates.  Parent age was added as an auxiliary correlate to all regression models to aid with the handling of missing data as described by Enders (2010) and originally described in Graham (2003). To address hypothesis one, a tobit regression model was calculated to explain parental acceptance based on the set of explanatory variables (emotional regulation, cognitive flexibility (control), cognitive flexibility (alternatives), religious fundamentalism, parental sanctification, parent gender, and parent sexual identity), while accounting for censoring on the outcome variable (Main Effects Model).  To address hypotheses 2-6, several interactions were added to the main effects model (Interactions Model).  The Main Effects Tobit Regression Model and Interaction Effects Tobit Regression Model were compared prior to interpretation using an F change test to determine the most parsimonious model.  Results were presented with Tobit regression alone and then with the addition of a Single Indicator Latent Variable approach (SILV) to correct for measurement error in the explanatory variables by specifying the unreliable (residual) variance (Cole & Preacher, 2014).  This technique was added after the model was determined due to the lack of ability to conduct Tobit regression with SILV and interaction terms and the need for the Main Effects Tobit Regression Model to be nested, and therefore consistent in approach, with the Interactions Effects Tobit Regression Model to be able to perform a model comparison.  All analyses were conducted in Mplus version 8 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2017).                   21  Table 2.1   Participant Demographic Characteristics (N = 663)  Variable % n Gender   Female/Woman 84.31 566 Male/Man 15.69 105 Sexual Orientation   Heterosexual 87.56 584 Bisexual 6.68 45 Other 1.82 12 Lesbian 1.52 10 Queer 0.91 6 Questioning 0.91 6 Gay 0.61 4 Race/Ethnicity   Caucasian/White/European American 90.65 608 Hispanic/Latino/A/South American  3.17 21 Other 2.41 16 Black/African American 1.66 12 Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander 1.21 8 Native American 0.75 5 Arab/Middle Eastern 0.15 1 Religious or Spiritual Affiliation   Protestant 27.49 185 None 20.24 134 Other 17.67 120 Spiritual 15.56 103 Catholic 10.57 71 Jewish 6.65 44 Buddhist 1.21 8 Muslim 0.30 3 Hindu 0.30 2 Religious Interpretation   Liberal 39.94 264 Moderate 23.45 158 Conservative 9.68 68 Education Level   Graduate Level College Degree 36.20 243 College Degree 26.55 179 Some College 23.23 155 Some Graduate Level Coursework 8.30 56 High School 1.36 29              22  Table 2.1 (continued)  Participant Demographic Characteristics (N = 663)  Variable % n Political Identification   Liberal 58.78 385 Moderate 24.89 166 Conservative 8.55 61 Other 7.60 51 Parent Reported Child Gender   Male/Man 28.85 198 Female/Woman 28.55 190 Trans Man 19.18 127 Trans Woman 9.97 66 Gender Non-conforming/Non-binary 9.67 64 Other 3.63 24 Parent Reported Child Years Out   2-5 Years 43.87 295 10 Years Or More 22.69 151 6-10 Years 18.15 122 1 Year Or Less 15.28 101 Parent Reported Child Age    11-20 Years 44.86 284  21-30 Years 35.07 222  31-40 Years 10.59 67  6-10 Years 4.42 28  41-50 Years 2.69 17  3-5 Years 1.58 10  51-58 Years 0.79 5                          23  Table 2.2  Parental Acceptance Item Sources   Parental Acceptance Scale Item Source Item Adapted From PAS1.   I invite my child to family events and ask them to bring their best friend.

A review of the five instruments and final items determined as a result of the factor analysis process used are detailed in the sections below.  A complete review of all instrument items can be found in Appendix B.  Parental acceptance instrument. An EFA using MLR was conducted to determine which items from the item set developed herein should be used as a measure of parental acceptance.  Prior to data analysis, negatively phrased items were scrutinized further.  Dalal and Carter (2015) suggests that negatively phrased items can lead to misleading conclusions due to the cognitive complexity required for responding to negatively phrased versus positively phrased items.  Therefore, only the 17 positively phrased items were included in the EFA.  The items for the parental acceptance instrument were coded as PAS, indicating that they were adaptations from Freedman (2008), and PA, indicating that they were from the other two sources (Ryan & Rees, 2012; Rohner & Khaleque; 2005).  PAS items 6 (I ask my child how their relationships are going.) and 7 (I offer my child support in their relationships.) were removed because they had been erroneously duplicated in survey items PA20 and PA22, and the PAS items demonstrated higher loadings.  Inspection of the scree plot indicated the presence of 1 factor, whereas the parallel analysis suggested possibly 2 factors to be extracted.  Eigenvalues also demonstrated a substantive difference in size between Eigenvalues for factors one and two (5.82 vs. 1.54).  Based on these initial results, a 2-factor solution was examined to see if two meaningful factors could be extracted.  It was observed that items on the second factor demonstrated low loadings, with the exception of two items that had been taken from the Parental Acceptance and Rejection measure, which was developed without a specific focus on the population of parents of LGBT children.  These results suggest the potential for over-extraction (Osborne, 2008).  After theoretical consideration and interpretability, a 1-factor solution was retained for further use.            27  Next, loadings and residuals were examined for the 1-factor solution.  Items with a factor loading less than .5 were not considered a strong representation of the factor.  Residual correlations above .15 were inspected to reduce item redundancy and to improve simplicity.  An iterative process was used for item removal until all items exhibited loadings above the .5 threshold, displayed residuals below .1, demonstrated clarity in sentence structure, and maintained adequate representation of the breadth of the parental acceptance construct.  For example, item 16 was removed due to it having the lowest loading, appearing to have redundancy with item 25, and appearing to be less focused on the parents of LGBT children population, and the largest residual correlation occurred between item 16 and 25 (.34).  This process resulted in the retention of 11 items (see Table 3.1 for a list of all 39 original items and reasons for item removal; see Table 3.2 for the final items and their loadings).  Internal consistency of reliability was α = .77 and ω = .80 for this sample. Cognitive flexibility instrument. Initially, a CFA was conducted to evaluate the two-factor structure described in the original CFIS development paper (Dennis & Vander Wal, 2010).  However, after several unsuccessful attempts to improve fit in combination with review of the literature on the CFIS which revealed a lack of prior CFA evaluation and cross loadings in the original EFA that complicate the ability to confirm the CFIS structure with a CFA approach, an EFA of the CFIS was conducted to evaluate fit using the same methodology as used for the PA EFA.  Two factors were identified from the parallel analysis and visual inspection of the scree plot. In order to explore the potential to consider the 2-factor measure as a univariate measure of cognitive flexibility, both a 1-Factor and 2-Factor structure were explored.  Inspection of the 1-Factor loadings indicated that items on the alternatives subscale were larger than the control items, which lent further support to presence of two factors.  Therefore, two factors were retained for the use in the final model, consisting of nine items for the Alternatives factor and three items for the Control factor.

Internal           28  consistency of reliability was α = .87 and ω = .88 for the CFIS-A and α = .81 and ω = .81 for CFIS-C for this sample.    Emotional regulation instrument. A CFA of the DERS was conducted to evaluate fit and explore the potential to consider the 6-Factor measure as a univariate measure of emotional regulation.  Analysis of the original 6-Factor structure of the DERS revealed less than ideal fitness and motivated exploration of a higher order 6-Factor analysis.  Review of the literature indicated that the Awareness factor has been problematic in past research (e.g., Bardeen, Fergus & Orcutt, 2012; Bardeen, Fergus, Hannan & Orcutt, 2016; Lee, Witte, Bardeen, Davis, & Weathers. 2016).  Therefore, a 5-factor model excluding all awareness items (2, 6, 8, 10, 17, 34) was evaluated.  Results indicated that the 5-factor DERS model demonstrated an improved fit to the sample data, c2(395) = 1067.363, p < .001, CFI = .889, TLI = .878, SRMR = .056, RMSEA = .053, 90% CI[.049, .057].  However, because of the presence of moderate to high correlations (.6 to .8) among factors and inconsistencies about the factor structure in the literature led to examination of a Bi-Factor model to determine if a general factor could better explain the structure (Rodriguez, Reise, & Haviland, 2016).  Results of the Bi-Factor model results demonstrated marginally improved fit to the sample data, c2(375) = 922.731, p < .001, CFI = .909, TLI = .895, SRMR = .046, RMSEA = .049, 90% CI [.045, .053].  Investigation of local fit revealed that 5 of the 435 item pairs had a residual correlation larger than .1 and none had residual correlations greater than .2, indicating acceptable local fit.  Further inspection revealed larger loadings on the general factor than the individual five factors.  This finding supported the presence of a generalized factor that would allow for use of all DERS items as a 1-factor measure without bias being a substantive concern.  Therefore, all DERS items excluding awareness items were used as univariate measure to assess emotional regulation.  Internal consistency of reliability was α = .94 and ω = .95 for this sample. Religious fundamentalism instrument. A CFA of the RFS was conducted to evaluate fit with the original 1-Factor measure of religious fundamentalism.  Results indicated that the 1-          29  factor RFS model was a marginal fit to the sample data, c2(54) = 324.549, p < .001, CFI = .912, TLI = .893, SRMR = .046, RMSEA = .090, 90% CI [.080, .099].  Examination of local fit indicated that 5 of the 66 item pairs had a residual correlation larger than .1 and none had residual correlations greater than .2, indicating acceptable local fit.  Internal consistency of reliability was α = .94 and ω = .94 for this sample. Parental sanctification instrument. A CFA of the MGP was conducted to evaluate fit with the original 1-Factor measure of parental sanctification.  The 1-factor MGP model was a marginal fit to the sample data, c2(77) = 578.553, p < .001, CFI = .928, TLI = .915, SRMR = .030, RMSEA = .099, 90% CI [.092, .107].  Review of local fit revealed that 2 of the 91 item pairs had a residual correlation larger than .1 and none had residual correlations greater than .2, indicating acceptable local fit.  Internal consistency of reliability was α = .98 and ω = .98 for this sample. Sample Statistics and Assumption Checking. Mean, standard deviation, range, skewness and kurtosis statistics can be found in Table 3.4.  Data censoring was evident in the distribution of PA scores. Scores on the PA variable were observed to be highly kurtotic (5.60) and strong left skewed (-2.08). Further inspection revealed that 32.42% of participants received the maximal score of 44, supporting the presence of a strong ceiling effect and a need to account for the right censoring of the PA variable and heteroscedasticity in later analyses.  Correlations and multicollinearity statistics (variance inflation factor and tolerance) can be found in Table 3.5.   Primary Regression Analyses  Table 3.6 provides the regression statistics for all regression models.  Results show the the Main Effects Tobit Regression Model was statistically significant, , F(7, 655) = 30.36, p <  .001 with an R2 of .25. Results for the Interaction Effects Tobit Regression Model were also significant, F(15, 647) = 14.37, p <  .001, R2 = .26. Next, an F change test comparing these nested models was conducted and was found to not be significant, F(8, 647) = 1.86, p = 0.06, ΔR2 = 0.02. Therefore, the Main Effects Tobit Regression Model was retained as the most parsimonious           30  model and used for further interpretation of the contribution of the explanatory variables to the outcome variable.  A single-indicator latent variable approach (SILV) was then applied to account for measurement error in the explanatory variables for the Main Effects Tobit Regression Model.   Results of the Main Effects Tobit Regression Model with SILV revealed a significant regression equation, F(7, 655) = 33.56, p < .001, R2 = .26. Cognitive flexibility control, religious fundamentalism, parental sanctification, parent gender, and parent sexual identity were significant predictors of parental acceptance.  The standardized regression coefficients detailed below can be considered effect size indicators as they allow for comparison of relative contributions of each predictor within the model. Higher cognitive flexibility control (β = .22, p = .02) and parental sanctification (β = .18, p = .004) scores significantly predicted higher parental acceptance scores.  Controlling for all other predictors, each one standard deviation increase in cognitive flexibility control and parental sanctification scores resulted in a .22 and .18 standard deviation increase in parental acceptance, respectively.  Lower religious fundamentalism scores also significantly predicted higher parental acceptance scores (β = - .43, p < .001).  This finding means that with each one standard deviation increase in religious fundamentalism, parental acceptance scores decreased by .43 standard deviations, controlling for all other predictors.  In addition, parent gender was a significant contributor to parental acceptance, such that fathers reported lower levels of acceptance than mothers (β = - .14, p = .002).  Parent sexual identity was also a significant contributor to parental acceptance, with heterosexual parents reporting lower levels of acceptance than LGB parents (β = - .15, p = .001).  The research hypothesis that cognitive flexibility alternatives and emotional regulation would explain a significant amount of variance in parental acceptance scores was not confirmed (p = .64 and .28, respectively).  See Figure 3.1 for a diagram of the Main Effects Tobit Regression Model with SILV. Structure coefficients were also computed as an additional check for multicollinearity. The structure coefficient provides the correlation of the explanatory variable with the predicted score for the outcome variable. Results indicated that structure coefficients mimicked the           31  ordering of the significant regression coefficients in terms of magnitude of contribution to the model, providing further evidence that multicollinearity is not a concern.  Review of the regression analyses results revealed a suppression effect between the religious value-based variables.  Specifically, the bivariate correlation between parental sanctification and parental acceptance was negative (r = - .12 ), whereas the contribution of parental sanctification to parental acceptance in the regression model was positive (β = .18).  Upon examination, this sign change was only found when religious fundamentalism was included in the model, indicating that the positive impact of parental sanctification on parental acceptance is only uncovered after partialing out the variance shared between parental sanctification and religious fundamentalism.           32  Table 3.1 Parental Acceptance Item Removal Process  Parental Acceptance Scale Item Reason for Removal (If Applicable) PAS1.  I invite my child to family events and ask them  to bring their best friend.

Hypothesis 1 was partially confirmed, such that the cognitive flexibility control factor, parental sanctification, religious fundamentalism, parent gender, and parent sexual orientation significantly predicted parental acceptance.  The predictive capacity of the cognitive flexibility alternatives factor and emotional regulation were not confirmed in this sample. Similarly, hypotheses 2-6 were not confirmed in this sample, as no significant interactions were found and the interactions model did not appear to be the most parsimonious model for the present data.  These findings are consistent with components of Chrisler’s theory and support the impact of cognitive processes and contextual factors on the parental acceptance process.   Consistent with Chrisler’s emphasis on parent appraisal, the finding that the cognitive flexibility control factor, but not the alternatives factor, significantly and positively impacted parental acceptance suggests the importance of parent’s sense of control in handling challenges such as having an LGBT child in a heteronormative society.  The cognitive behavior of being able to generate alternatives did not significantly influence parental acceptance, suggesting that there may be an important distinction between these two facets of cognitive flexibility that impact the acceptance process differently.  However, it is also important to note that these results may also relate to a methodological limitation, considering the limited amount of variation on the cognitive flexibility alternatives factor in this sample (SD = 0.63).  These findings extend previous qualitative research suggesting the impact of cognitive flexibility in the acceptance process (e.g., Bertone & Franchi, 2014; Fields, 2001; Gonzalez, Rostosky, Odom, & Riggle, 2013), and quantitative research suggesting the impact of cognitive flexibility on the functioning of families with LGBT children (Goodrich & Gilbride, 2010), in addition to our understanding of factors relating to heterosexism (Goodrich, Selig, & Crofts, 2014).  Future research should           42  continue examination of cognitive-affective factors in larger samples with more response variation.   Also consistent with Chrisler’s stressing of the importance of contextual factors, the religious value-based factors significantly impacted parental acceptance such that less religious fundamentalism and more parental sanctification predicted more parental acceptance of an LGBT child.  Religious fundamentalism provided the largest contribution to the model, suggesting that religious fundamentalist values are a challenging barrier to parental acceptance.  Though not as strong, parental sanctification’s significant and positive contribution to the model suggests that some religious values can positively impact the parental acceptance process.  These findings extend previous research on the impact of religiosity on the acceptance process (e.g., Freedman, 2008; Maslowe & Yarhouse, 2015; Pearlman, 2005), in particular Ryan and colleagues (2010) findings that family religiosity relates to less perceived parental acceptance.  The findings from this sample of parents build on these previous findings by highlighting the complexity of religiosity as a construct with both challenging and beneficial components. While a multicollinearity relationship was not observed between these two religious variables, a suppression effect was noted.  This suggests that the inclusion of religious fundamentalism as a control when examining the predicative ability of parental sanctification on parental acceptance allows us to see a more accurate picture of the relationships among these variables than we would have been able to capture in bivariate correlations.  More research on the relationship between these two variables would be a valuable contribution to the literature in this area.    The influence of parent gender and sexual identity further supports Chrisler’s emphasis on context.  Parent gender significantly predicted parental acceptance, such that cisgender mothers were more accepting than cisgender fathers.  This finding is also consistent with previous literature that suggests parent gender differences in the acceptance process amongst cisgender parents (e.g., Chung, 2017; Conley, 2011; D’Amico et al., 2015, Kuvalanka, Weiner, & Mahan,           43  2014; Riggs, & Due, 2015).   Additionally, parents who identified as LGB were significantly more accepting than parents who identified as heterosexual.  This finding regarding parent sexual identity’s contribution to parental acceptance provides a new contribution to the published literature.  Importantly, these demographic contributions to the model should be interpreted with caution due to the size differences between groups and the lack of ability to do measurement invariance testing as a result of the small sample sizes.  Study Limitations and Future Research  While the model tested provides valuable insights, accounting for 26% of the variance in parental acceptance scores and highlighting the nuanced impact of religious values based values on self-reported parental acceptance, several limitations exist that should be considered when interpreting these findings.  A large portion of the variance (74%) remains unaccounted for by this model that suggests the influence of other factors. Two factors that were not addressed by this model were the potential impact of the LGBT child’s age and the number of years that parents have known their child’s LGBT identity. Parental acceptance may be influenced by the stage of life the child is in (i.e., early childhood, puberty, adulthood) and the amount of time parents have known their child was LGBT. Future research could collect data from large cohorts of parents grouped by child age and length of time knowing their child’s identity and examine differences in parental acceptance.  Methodologically, it is also possible that parental acceptance scores may be impacted by parent’s having to project into the future for certain items (i.e., those related to dating) on the parental acceptance scale. Future research should consider refining measurement of parental acceptance to addresses the diverse experiences parents at different stages.  Another consideration for future instrument development relates to the possibility that there may be different types of parental acceptance. For example, parental acceptance of sexual identity may be different than gender identity. Moreover, differences between global measures of parental acceptance of children in general and LGBT specific parental acceptance have yet to be           44  examined. Future measurement development research would benefit from this increased specificity in the concept of parental acceptance.  Similarly, another point for future consideration is the examination of more religious-value based variables to refine understanding of the myriad ways religious values impact parental acceptance. Religious fundamentalism and parental sanctification are two of many religious variables that could impact parental acceptance. Future research should consider other variables like religious coping and religious conflict in addition to the two addressed in this model to increase understanding of the impact of religious factors on parent’s acceptance of their LGBT children.  Several other methodological factors should also be considered in interpretation of these findings. Although a strong effort was made to recruit participants diverse in gender, race, religion, religious interpretation, and parental acceptance, the majority of participants were White, Christian mothers with a liberal religious interpretation and high levels of parental acceptance. The challenges obtaining a representative sample may have impacted my ability to test the model I set out to test by limiting the generalizability to the majority demographics of this sample stated above. Future research would benefit from more sample diversity, an outcome that would be greatly aided by inclusion of members of these groups on research teams conducting research on parental acceptance to increase parent trust.  Additionally, while the use of an online sampling methodology can be a valuable tool for recruiting a large sample focused on a sensitive subject, issues with internal validity and sampling bias due to accessibility for non-internet users are limitations.   Another methodological limitation is the lack of questioning about where participants received the link for the survey. While knowing the locations participants suggests location diversity, knowing the specific recruitment source may have contributed increased understanding about the parents in this sample, such as a high level of sampling from members of PFLAG. Future research should include a question identifying where participants learned about the study.            45  Similarly, the failure to ask parents their child’s sexual identity was another challenge in this study.  Future research should inquire about the sexual identity of the child to more fully capture the experiences of parents in their sample.   Finally, construct measurement is another limitation of this project.  The lack of measures available on parental acceptance of an LGBT child necessitated the use of a measure developed by the author which has not been used previously.  In this study, censoring of the author-developed parental acceptance scale was a challenge. This censoring could be caused by multiple factors, including limited response options (only a 4-point likert scale, ranging from 1 [always true] to 4 [never true]), questions that were too easy, and/or having a large amount of highly accepting participants. Future research should consider how to strengthen the instrument by providing more response options and increasing the difficulty of the items, in addition to efforts to increase representativeness of the population of parents of LGBT children inclusive of less accepting and more diverse parents. This will improve the precision of the instrument and the generalizability to parents beyond white, highly educated, liberal mothers with high levels of acceptance. Based on this limitation, generalizability to parents with other demographic characteristics should be done with caution.  Additionally, similar to the cognitive flexibility measure, a small variance was noted on the emotional regulation measure (SD = .46), which may have impacted the ability to find significance in this sample. Future research could consider examining emotional regulation with multiple instruments and in a more representative sample.  Implications  The present study has important implications for psychological practice, education, and advocacy with parents of LGBT children.  From a practice perspective, this study highlights three important variables to consider in the treatment process: sense of control in being cognitively flexible to work through challenging situations, religious fundamentalist beliefs, and sanctification of their role as a parent.  These findings suggest that parents may need support in           46  feeling a sense of control in thinking through the challenge of having an LGBT child and time to explore and process the nuances in their religious values and ways their beliefs both challenge and promote their acceptance.  Recognizing the importance of building this sense of control, and honoring the complex impact religiosity can have on the acceptance process, may be an important part of the therapy process.   Chrisler’s (2017) theory can be a useful framework for considering clinical intervention.  To engage parents in therapy and work on developing cognitive flexibility, therapists can encourage parents to explore their appraisals regarding the knowledge that their child is LGBT, clarify how their appraisals connect to different emotive responses, and consider their current coping reactions.  Therapists can help parents develop awareness of their cognitive and behavioral coping behaviors by asking parents to reflect on whether they are they are engaging in avoidance or approach coping and to identify how their coping tendencies relate to their distress and connectedness to their child.  Exploring these areas, building adaptive approach coping skills, and engaging parents in a meaning-making reappraisal of their experience may support an increased sense of control in parents’ ability to handle cognitive challenges.  Theoretical approaches aimed at increasing cognitive flexibility, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, may also be valuable tools for strengthening parent’s cognitive flexibility.  Integrating aspects of motivational interviewing may also assist with the ambivalence some parents may feel as a result of moving their focus from their child needing to change to creating change within themselves.  For parents with whom religious identity is important, treatments such as Religiously Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Pearce et al., 2015), may provide useful tools to incorporate in the therapy process.  Research also suggests that engaging in support groups such as PFLAG can be helpful in fostering hope when parents are feeling overwhelmed (e.g., Beeler & DiProva, 1999; Broad, 2011; Lee & Lee, 2006).   A small body of literature also provides recommendations for working with parents in therapy who are higher on the religiously fundamentalist spectrum (Aten, Mangis, & Campbell,           47  2010; Friedson, 2015) and whose religious beliefs contribute to distress (Rosenfeld, 2010).  Aten and colleagues’ suggestions include engaging in therapist self-awareness, collaborating with clergy, and respecting client belief systems.  Noting the tendency toward secularism amongst psychologists, Aten el al. emphasize the importance of therapists engaging in a self-reflective process in order to create a nonjudgmental therapeutic space that minimizes over-pathologizing and promotes parent trust.  Collaboration with clergy and respecting client belief systems are also valued ways to demonstrate commitment to understanding religious parent experiences while also creating a referral network (Aten et al., 2010).  Sensitivity and intentionality regarding when and how rigid belief systems such as religiously-rooted heteronormative beliefs is also a noted concern (Aten et al., 2010).  Spending time developing rapport with parents (perhaps more than is typical) and building a strong alliance is emphasized as an imperative step prior to challenging a parent’s belief system.  Part of the rapport building process with parents may include addressing religious differences directly (especially when asked) and approaching clients from a holistic perspective that values the interconnectivity between the mind, body, and spirit and supports use of religious resources (Aten et al., 2010)).   Rosenfeld (2010) similarly stresses the importance of respecting client belief systems; however, he also notes that respect does not equal condoning, which is important when considering the impact of parental rejection on LGBT children and the risk to the LGBT child’s wellbeing.  Both Rosenfeld and Friedson (2015) also emphasize that it is essential for therapists to be aware of the intense stress challenging of religious beliefs can create for clients like religiously fundamentalist parents of LGBT children.  Rosenfeld provides an excellent in-depth resource for considering when and how to challenge parent beliefs to be the most effective and preserve the alliance.  Moreover, scholars agree that emphasizing positive religious aspects, such as forgiveness, can be helpful in promoting positive religious coping and can be useful for the alliance, as therapists who may not identify as religious can still share positive values with           48  parents who are concerned about feeling misunderstood by a secular therapist (Aten et al., 2010; Rosenfeld, 2010).     Relatedly, this study’s findings also suggest the value of exploring a positive component of religiousness, parental sanctification, in the therapeutic process.  Helping parents explore and identify beliefs about the holiness of their parent role may help build motivation toward engaging in reappraisal and increase levels of acceptance.  According to Mahoney, Paragament, Murray-Swank, and Murry-Swank (2003), parental sanctification can promote individual benefits such as “a deeper sense of meaning from family life” and “greater sense of personal pleasure and fulfillment from family relationships” (p. 227).  In addition, Mahoney and colleagues suggests that sanctification can promote greater relationship investment that is connected to forgiveness, acceptance of differences, and constructive problem solving.  In therapy, therapists can help parents identify their belief in their parent role as holy, celebrate benefits such as those described by Mahoney et al. above, and connect their parental sanctification to other aspects of their religious identities that promote positive coping (even if negative aspects of their faith are still present).  Assessment of religious values and resources at intake can be a valuable tool for creating conversation around the salience of a client’s religious identity and parental sanctification beliefs.  Integration of strengths-based approaches to therapy, such as Strengths-Based Cognitive–Behavioral Therapy (Padesky & Mooney, 2012), may be helpful tools as well.  Honoring clients experience of both sanctifying their relationship and experiencing emotional pain may also serve as cognitive flexibility practice that over time may support increased sense of control. The findings related to gender and sexual orientation underscore the need for intervention with fathers and heterosexual parents.  Given that these identities are typically identities of privilege, they likely encounter more dissonance in challenging heteronormative structures and require more time to process and challenge their previous understandings of the world.  Exploration of gender socialization is a recommended tool for helping men understand the impact           49  of cultural messages about gender and sexuality while lessening defensiveness (Nutt & Brooks, 2008).  Previous research exploring gender role strain amongst men in an Evangelical Christian group also supports the value of gender role exploration in connection with restructuring of religious values to focus on facilitating closer relationships with children (Silverstein, Auerbach, & Levant, 2002).  Research also suggests the value of processing heteronormative socialization (Hildebrandt, 2012; Priestley, 2009; Smith, 2009).  Findings suggest that this process is even important for parents who believe themselves to be accepting (Smith, 2009), as was the case for many parents in the current sample.  Jewell, Morrison, and Gazzola (2012) provide a detailed description of components for developing attitudinal and behavioral change interventions with heterosexuals that may be valuable for developing interventions with parents.  Some of their recommendations that may be particularly helpful include providing education to counter stereotypes, challenging discrepancies between egalitarian beliefs and behaviors, engaging in reflection, and supporting opportunities to apply newly acquired information and behaviors (Jewell et al.).   Targeted evidence-based interventions for fathers and heterosexual parents are needed to better facilitate acceptance in parents from these groups. In attention to clinical implications, bringing awareness of the need to help parents feel a sense of control when faced with cognitive challenges and recognize challenges and benefits of religion is an important component of education and advocacy to support to parents of LGBT children.  The current political narrative that places religious people and the LGBT community in opposition must be challenged to foster more positive environments for LGBT people and their families.  The success of this change hinges on the ability of change makers to build bridges across the lines of religious and LGBT issues. Recognition of the complex impact of religiosity on acceptance is vital to this process.  Similar to recommendations for therapists, educators and activists should engage in self-reflection regarding their biases toward religiosity and engage with religious communities to be inclusive of diverse parents. Additionally, while there has been a           50  greater focus on affirmative therapy in recent years, as evidenced by formal American Psychological Association practice guidelines for both LGB (American Psychological Association, 2012) and Transgender communities (American Psychological Association, 2015), training regarding how to discuss religion in therapy is limited.  This gap in education limits therapist’s cultural competence in engaging with an important and common aspect of diversity (Pearson, 2017).  Incorporation of an intersectional approach that is inclusive of religious identity is essential to create the systemic change that is needed to promote parental acceptance of LGBT children in families where religious identity is an important component of the acceptance process.               51  Appendix A Recruitment Materials Approved Advertisement:              52  Recruitment Sources:

You will probably find that you agree with some of the statements, and disagree with others to varying extents.  Please indicate your reaction to each statement, according to the following scale:  8-   Strongly Agree 9-   Agree 10-  Somewhat Agree 11-  Neutral 12-  Somewhat Disagree 13-  Disagree 14-  Strongly Disagree  1. God has given humanity a complete, unfailing guide to happiness and salvation, which must be totally followed. 2. No single book of religious teachings contains all the intrinsic, fundamental truths about life.* 3. The basic cause of evil in this work is Satan, who is still constantly and ferociously fighting against God. 4. It is more important to be a good person than to believe in God and the right religion.* 5. There is a particular set of religious teachings in this world that are so true, you can’t go any “deeper” because they are the basic, bedrock message that God has given humanity.  6. When you get right down to it, there are basically only two kinds of people in the world: the Righteous, who will be rewarded by God: and the rest, who will not.           85  7. Scriptures may contain general truths, but they should NOT be considered completely, literally true from beginning to end.* 8. To lead the best, most meaningful life, one must belong to the one, fundamentally true religion. 9. “Satan” is just the name people give to their own bad impulses. They really is no such thing as a diabolical “Prince of Darkness” who tempts us.* 10. Whenever science and sacred scripture conflict, science is probably right.* 11. The fundamentals of God’s religion should never be tampered with, or compromised with others’ beliefs. 12. All of the religions in the world have flaws and wrong teachings. There is no perfectly true right religion.* *indicates item is worded in the con-trait direction, for which the scoring key is reversed.               86  Parental Sanctification Instrument The Revised Manifestation of God in Parenting Scale (Murray-Swank et al., 2006) Some of the following questions use the word \"God.\" Different people use different terms for God, such as \"Higher Power,\" \"Divine Spirit,\" \"Spiritual Force,\" \"Holy Spirit,\" \"Yahweh,\" \"Allah,\" \"Buddha,” or “Goddess.” Please feel free to substitute your own word for God when answering any of the questions that follow.

    "abstract": "Chrisler’s (2017) Theoretical Framework of Parental Reactions When a Child Comes Out as Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual suggests that parental reactions to having a non-heteronormative child are impacted by a process of cognitively appraising information about their child’s identity and experiencing and coping with emotional responses, both of which are influenced by contextual factors such as a parent’s value system. However, some religious values can challenge parents in the process of accepting a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) child. The purpose of this study was to test a model that examines the influence of cognitive-affective factors (cognitive flexibility, emotional regulation), religious-value based factors (religious fundamentalism, parental sanctification), and gender and sexual identity on self-reported parental acceptance. Participants were 663 parents of LGBT children who submitted responses to an online survey. A Tobit regression with a single-indicator latent variable approach revealed that religious fundamentalism, parental sanctification, the control component of cognitive flexibility, parent gender, and parent sexual identity significantly predicted parental acceptance. Lower religious fundamentalism, higher parental sanctification, and higher cognitive flexibility scores were associated with parental acceptance of an LGBT child. Participants identifying as a woman or LGB parent also significantly predicted acceptance. Implications of findings are discussed",
