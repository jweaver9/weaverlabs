Limitations of theseprevious studies include small sample size, lack of theoreticalframework, and the absence of empirical testing of hypotheses.The present study builds on these works through the use of Craig’smodel, the inclusion of multi-disciplinary research, and the em-pirical testing of data collected from more than 240 Canadiancollective agreements. Key findings include that larger, publicsector bargaining units with equality clauses in their collectiveagreements were most likely also to contain clauses that prohib-ited discrimination based on sexual orientation. The paperconcludes with suggestions for future research.Since the 1980s, awareness has increased concerning employmentdiscrimination against gays and lesbians. In fact, all three actors of theIndustrial Relations (IR) system (Labour, Government and PrivateAgencies, and Management) have addressed issues concerning sexual ori-entation. For example, in Canada, most governments have passed human– BROWN, T., Faculty of Business Administration, Memorial University of Newfoundland,St. John’s, Newfoundland, <travorb@mun.ca>.– The author would like to thank Morley Gunderson, the anonymous reviewers as well asthe editorial committee for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.

An earlier version of this paper was presented at theCanadian Industrial Relations Association (CIRA) Annual Meeting, May 25–28, 2000,Edmonton, Alberta.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02644645SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSrights legislation that specifically prohibits discrimination based on sexualorientation (Wintemute 1996). In addition, courts in both Alberta and inthe federal jurisdictions have “read in” prohibitions against discriminationbased on sexual orientation when the legislation in question did notspecifically reference it (Zinn and Brethour 1999). Moreover, severalunionized and non-unionized employers have recently added same-sexbenefits to their traditional benefits plans (Human Rights Campaign 2002),and some unions have included sexual orientation in the non-discriminationclauses of their collective agreements (Brown 1998; Hunt 1997).Much of the information concerning gay and lesbian workplace issuesconsists of web site data consolidated by gay and lesbian activists (e.g.,The Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights 2000; Human RightsCampaign 2002; Stratton 2000). To date, there have only been a limitednumber of studies which have examined the role of Canadian unions inaddressing the workplace issues of gays and lesbians.Perhaps the earliest work in this area was that of Genge (1983). Genge’swork is seminal in that it is the first to openly address the role of Canadianlabour in the workplace issues of lesbians and gays. In this work, Gengepresents her own experience and overviews the resolutions passed byunions, in particular by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE),the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) as well as by the Canadian LabourCongress (CLC) to include sexual orientation in discrimination clauses ofcollective agreements, constitutions and laws. Similarly, White (1993), inher book Sisters in Solidarity, provides a brief overview of sexual orienta-tion issues focusing on the legal issues of the early 1990s and labour’srole in promoting these issues. Petersen (1999) builds on this foundationby overviewing recent human rights tribunal rulings and court case resultsconcerning same-sex partner benefits and the role of union activists in theserulings and cases.Recently, two more in-depth studies have also been conducted. Thefirst, Hunt (1997), represents an in-depth three-phase study. Phase oneconsisted of telephone surveys of 9 Canadian labour federations and 29Canadian unions. Phase two consisted of three in-depth case studies of theunions deemed by Hunt to be the most progressive, namely, CUPE, theNational Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers ofCanada (CAW), and the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC). Phasethree was a descriptive statistical analysis (e.g., frequencies, percentages)of the non-discrimination provisions of over 3400 Ontario collective agree-ments covering more than 200 employees. Based on this work, Huntconcluded that public sector unions were more active in addressing theissues of gays and lesbians than were private sector unions, and that issuesconcerning sexual orientation often surfaced in female dominated unions.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02645646 RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, 2003, VOL. 58, No 4Hunt’s (1997) argument that public sector unions were more progres-sive in this area should not be surprising for at least two reasons. First, theemployer of these public sector groups is the government. Given thevisibility of government employment decisions and policies, there may beincreased pressure for these governments to act as ‘model’ employers rela-tive to their counterparts in the private sector (Gunderson 1995; Ponak andThompson 2001). Second, there are significant demographic differencesbetween private and public sector unions that may play a role here. Forexample, Ponak and Thompson (2001: 474) argue that public sector unions,with their approximately 58% female membership relative to the one-thirdfemale membership of private sector unions “have been among the strongestadvocates of workplace equity” in terms of employment equity, pay equityand anti-discrimination regulations.Brown’s (1998) study built on the work of Hunt by adding a UnitedStates comparison. His study consisted of interviews (phone and e-mail)and secondary source data (web sites, collective agreements, union publi-cations) concerning two federations of labour: the American Federation ofLabor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) and the CLC, aswell as four unions, two from Canada (CUPE, CAW) and two similar unionsfrom the United States (American Federation of State, County andMunicipal Employees [AFSCME], the United Autoworkers of America[UAW]). Brown suggested that public sector unions were more active inthe area of sexual orientation, that a union’s first efforts in the area of sexualorientation focused on freedom from discrimination before moving on tosame-sex benefits, and that larger bargaining units were more likely to in-clude sexual orientation clauses in their collective agreements. A potentialexplanation as to why a union’s initial efforts focus on freedom from dis-crimination may be the fact that unions view non-discrimination languagein collective agreements as a method of educating members concerningdiscrimination issues (Giles and Starkman 1995). Hence, unions may chooseto focus on an education mandate before moving to the benefits arena inan effort to make their members more aware of, and comfortable with,workplace issues concerning sexual orientation. A potential explanationfor why larger bargaining units are more active in this area may simply bedue to the availability of resources. Larger units may have more resourcesto dedicate to equality issues (e.g., special committees, educational/aware-ness programs, etc.) relative to smaller units where union resources maybe dedicated to the more traditional areas of negotiations, grievances andarbitrations. Brown’s (1998) research also highlighted the importance ofboth women’s and employment equity committees. As these committeesoften examined issues concerning fair treatment, non-discrimination, har-assment, and education, much of the initial forays into sexual orientationBrown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02646647SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSin the unions in Brown’s study were initiated and championed by women’sand employment equity committees.While the studies of both Hunt (1997) and Brown (1998) break newground in this area, these studies leave at least three significant gaps. First,they fail to use a theoretical framework or model to ground their research,develop hypotheses/propositions, or frame their findings. Second, they donot provide a systematic, statistical testing of important hypotheses. Rather,these studies used qualitative case study analysis and non-inferential sta-tistical analysis that precluded the testing of key relationships or hypoth-eses. Third, while it is argued that IR is a multi-disciplinary field (Hébert,Jain, and Meltz 1988), these past works failed to include relevant researchfrom other disciplines, in particular sociology and psychology, to help frametheir research. As such, the over-arching purpose of the present study wasto systematically develop and test several of the relationships proposed byBrown and Hunt using quantitative analyses and a more substantivetheoretical base.As argued by Kervin (1992: 54), there has been “a long-simmering”debate concerning the relative merits of qualitative versus quantitative re-search. My decision to use a quantitative approach in the present studywas largely guided by the view that social science “research requires bothqualitative and quantitative approaches: the former in an exploratory phaseto generate understanding and ideas, the latter to test these ideas” (Kervin1992: 54). More specifically, my decision to now turn to quantitative re-search was based on the following. First, the previous work in this areahas been largely qualitative. As is the case with qualitative research (Kervin1992; Saks 2000), these studies have provided excellent, in-depth discus-sions of the key areas of interest (in this case issues concerning sexualorientation) as these issues play out in a small sample (in this case un-ions). As such, these past studies have given us the ability to “understanda specific, particular event by getting ‘inside it’” (Kervin 1992: 54). How-ever, limitations of qualitative approaches include that they do not allowfor statistical testing of key relationships as “methods of analysis are notwell formulated” (Saks 2000: 154) and such approaches cannot assess theextent to which the qualitative findings from one setting hold true in othersettings (Kervin 1992; Saks 2000). Second, these limitations of qualitativeresearch can be overcome by well-proven quantitative methods designedto empirically test key relationships. Thus quantitative methods allow usto test the extent to which the findings of the qualitative research hold truein other settings and samples.In terms of the theoretical framework selected for this study, the sys-tems approach was chosen as it is the basis of the pluralist approach to IRand as this approach is “the starting point for scientific analysis” (MeltzBrown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02647648 RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, 2003, VOL. 58, No 41993: 164). In particular, Craig’s model of industrial relations was used asit has frequently been used as the basis for industrial relations teachingand interpretation in Canada (Gottlieb Taras, Ponak, and Gunderson 2001;Meltz 1993). While a detailed presentation of Craig’s model is availableelsewhere (Craig 1988, 1990; Craig and Solomon 1996), a summary ofCraig’s model follows. Craig views the three actors of the IR system beingimpacted by internal inputs (e.g., power, values, and goals of the actors)that flow from the external inputs of the external environment. These ex-ternal inputs (or environmental subsystems) include the legal subsystem,economic subsystem, political subsystem, and social subsystem. Througha series of conversion mechanisms (e.g., day-to-day relationships, nego-tiation processes, third party interventions, strikes and lockouts), the actorsproduce organizational and worker-oriented outputs (e.g., managementrights, union recognition/security, terms and conditions of work, wage andeffort bargain, etc.). These outputs, through the feedback loop, impact theexternal environment and the IR system (in particular the power, valuesand goals of the actors) such that the system is dynamic and ever changing.As previously stated, the outputs of the IR system are influenced bythe inputs from the environment. In terms of the current external inputs,we see a legal subsystem that is increasing its recognition of gay and les-bian workplace rights (Petersen 1999; Wintemute 1996), a political sub-system that has taken legislative action to entrench these rights (Peterson1999; Wintemute 1996), and a social subsystem where public opinionconcerning gays and lesbians is changing. For example, in Canada we haverecently seen several provinces (e.g., British Columbia, Quebec andOntario) permit same-sex unions as a recognized form of marriage (Makin2003) or as a recognized form of civil union (“N84, Loi instituant l’unioncivile” 2003). In fact, in the first four months after Ontario permitted same-sex marriages, over 780 same-sex licenses were issued by the city ofToronto alone (Harding 2003)!In terms of the social subsystem, and in particular the public opinionelement, research has shown that public attitudes towards gays and lesbi-ans are not uniform and that a number of interesting differences exist. First,past research from the United States and Canada has highlighted the roleof gender differences in terms of reactions to gays and lesbians. Forexample, Herek (2002: 41–42), when summarizing a series of researchpapers (Herek and Capitanio 1995, 1996, 1998) resulting from nationalphone surveys of over 1,000 Americans, stated that research has shownthat: “heterosexual men consistently displayed more negative affectivereactions to homosexuality than did heterosexual women.” Moreover, inHerek’s (2002) phone survey of over 650 Americans, women weresignificantly more supportive of passing laws that protected gays andBrown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02648649SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSlesbians from discrimination in the workplace, as well as laws thatrecognized gay male marriages and same-sex benefits for gay males. Herekalso found that while men and women were supportive of gays and lesbianshaving equal rights in terms of job opportunities, they were less support-ive of passing a law that specified that gays and lesbians should have equalemployment rights. From a Canadian perspective, a study of approximately200 university students also showed that male students had less positiveattitudes towards gay men than did female students (Schellenberg, Hirt,and Sears 1999).Second, while Hofstede (1998) noted that there are many cultural simi-larities between Canada and the United States, Canadians, when comparedto Americans, are generally more likely to support measures designed toreduce discrimination based on sexual orientation and have been foundto be more supportive of the need for equal rights for gays and lesbians inthe military and teaching positions relative to Americans (Mazzuca 2002).Moreover, over 60% of Canadians responding to an Angus Reid poll wereconcerned with discrimination against gays and lesbians, suggesting that“Canadians view gay and lesbian discrimination in the workplace . . . as afundamental issue of human rights and equality” (“Stop bias against gays”1995: A19). Additional evidence suggests that 56% of 1500 Canadianssurveyed in a Southam News-Angus Reid public opinion poll supportedamending the Canadian Human Rights Act to provide protection fromdiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation (Bryden 1996) and 75%of 1500 people surveyed by Angus Reid supported legislation barring em-ployment and housing discrimination against gays and lesbians (Ovenden1998; Wright 1998). A limitation of these polls is that they strictly reporteddescriptive statistics and largely reported the percentages of each provincethat supported sexual orientation issues. None of these reports statisticallyexamined whether attitudes differed by gender. However, a recent Canadianstudy examined the relationship between gender, education—both interms of discipline (e.g., Arts, Science, Social Sciences, etc.) and level(e.g., number or years of education)—and people’s attitudes towardshomosexuality. Specifically, Schellenberg et al. (1999) found that Artsand Social Sciences students (regardless of gender) had more positive atti-tudes toward gay men as compared to Science and Business majorsand that the attitudes of male students towards gay men improved witheducation levels.As previously discussed, Craig’s model suggests that external envi-ronmental factors (such as the public opinion results previously discussed)influence the goals and values of actors as well as the outputs of the in-dustrial relations system. As such, we would expect that based on thisattitudinal research, unions with memberships that are: (1) largely female,Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02649650 RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, 2003, VOL. 58, No 4(2) highly educated, and (3) comprised of people from the social sciencesand arts disciplines would have more favourable attitudes towards issuesassociated with sexual orientation. An industry known for being femaledominated, highly educated, and largely comprised of people who studiedin the social sciences and arts disciplines is the public sector (Ponak andThompson 2001). As such, it is not surprising that Hunt (1997) and Brown(1998) found that this sector was more active than the private sector inissues concerning sexual orientation.Based on the past research of Brown (1998) and Hunt (1997), and thepreceding literature concerning public attitudes, I set out to test the fol-lowing hypotheses:Hypothesis 1: Relative to collective agreements in the private sector,public sector collective agreements are more likely to have anti-discrimination clauses that include sexual orientation and same-sex benefits provisions.Hypothesis 2: Larger bargaining units are more likely to have anti-discrimination clauses which include sexual orientation and same-sex benefits relative to smaller bargaining units.Hypothesis 3: As compared to collective agreements not containingequality clauses, collective agreements containing equality clauses(e.g., employment equity, sexual harassment, equal pay and dis-ability) are more likely to have anti-discrimination clauses thatinclude sexual orientation and same-sex benefits.Hypothesis 4: Collective agreements that have anti-discriminationlanguage that provides protection based on sexual orientation aremore likely to have same-sex benefits language than those that donot.METHODSampleThe sample consisted of 248 collective agreements from the HumanResources Development Canada’s (HRDC) collective agreement library.In September of 1999, when this sample was drawn, there were approxi-mately 1076 collective agreements in the HRDC’s collective agreementlibrary. These 1076 agreements only included provincial agreements withover 200 employees and federal agreements of over 500 employees. Thetotal number of employees in the sample of 248 collective agreements was493,812. The agreements in the sample had expiration dates ranging from1993 to 2004 with the mode expiration date being 1998. The library codesBrown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02650651SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSall collective agreements in a database. The initial sample was drawn byan electronic search conducted by the HRDC library staff. They selectedall agreements in the sample that HRDC had coded as having some lan-guage concerning prohibited grounds of discrimination. This decision wasmade because I wished to examine the specific language concerning dis-crimination, as my primary intent was to examine the extent to which sexualorientation was included as a prohibited grounds of discrimination in theseagreements.The decision to focus on collective agreement language was based onthe view that these agreements remain “at the center of the Canadianindustrial relations system” (Giles and Starkman 1995: 368) as they providea framework that guides the day-to-day relationships of the parties and,therefore, the rights of employees. In terms of my decision to look at dis-crimination provisions in collective agreements, this decisions was guidedby the view that unions seek to include these clauses as they have theadvantages of educating members and allowing these issues to be enforce-able via the grievance procedure (Giles and Starkman 1995).ProcedureThe procedure included three key steps. First, once the sample hadbeen drawn, a research assistant, who had been previously employed inthe HRDC library, took the list of agreements identified by the HRDCsearch and manually searched each collective agreement. She photocop-ied all language in the agreement that related to discrimination andprohibited forms of discrimination.Second, a second research assistant and the researcher reviewed thelanguage provided by the first research assistant. They independently as-sessed the extent to which the collective agreement language prohibiteddiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Specifically, they inde-pendently coded the discrimination variable as follows: 0 = no provisionconcerning sexual orientation, 1 = clause refers to human rights code whichincludes sexual orientation protection, and 2 = sexual orientation explic-itly stated. Collective agreements that used the terms sexual preference,gay and/or lesbian, were also coded in this final category.Third, as the secondary purpose of this study was to examine the ex-tent to which the collective agreements in the sample contained same-sexbenefits language, the HRDC staff also conducted an electronic search forsame-sex benefits provisions. Only five agreements were found in thesample that contained such benefits. The exact contract language was thenprovided to the researcher by the HRDC staff.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02651652 RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, 2003, VOL. 58, No 4VariablesThe key independent variables in this study included public sector,bargaining unit size, and presence of equality issues clauses in collectiveagreements.Public Sector. This was a dichotomous variable coded as private sec-tor = 0 and public sector = 1. Consistent with the definition of Ponak andThompson (2001), public sector was deemed to include three levels ofgovernment (local, provincial, federal), health and welfare, as well as edu-cation. In the present sample, 152 (61.3%) of the collective agreementswere in the public sector.Size. The size of the bargaining unit ranged from 200 to 40,000. Theaverage bargaining unit was 1992 (sd = 3767). The variable was collapsedinto equal thirds of small (below 600 employees), medium (600–1100employees) and large (over 1101 employees).Equality Issues. As previously stated, sexual orientation issues are of-ten championed by unions concerned with equality issues (e.g., employ-ment equity and women’s committees). The collective agreement librarydatabase captured whether or not collective agreements contained languageconcerning disabilities (an area covered by human rights and employmentequity legislation), employment equity, and two factors that could be seenas women’s issues (namely, sexual harassment and equal pay). In the dataset, each of these variables was coded dichotomously where 1 = provisionpresent and 0 = provision not present. Overall, 112 (45.2%) had languageconcerning disabilities, 45 (18.1%) had language concerning employmentequity, 98 (39.5%) had language concerning sexual harassment, and 36(14.5%) had language concerning equal pay. A multicolinearity check wasconducted using Pearson correlations between these variables. None of thecorrelations exceeded .30; hence, there was no evidence of multicolinearity.The key dependent variables in this study were anti-discriminationclauses that included sexual orientation and same-sex benefits.Anti-discrimination Clauses. As previously discussed, a research as-sistant and the researcher independently read and coded the discrimina-tion clauses. They coded the clauses as follows: 0 = no provision concerningsexual orientation, 1 = clause refers to human rights code which includessexual orientation protection, and 2 = sexual orientation explicitly stated.There was 100% agreement between the research assistant and the re-searcher regarding the coding of the discrimination language. Sample anti-discrimination clauses are located in Table 1. The frequencies of these levelswere 119 (48.0%), 34 (13.7%), and 95 (38.3%), respectively.As previously stated, American research (Herek 2002) found that whilemen and women were supportive of gays and lesbians having equal rightsBrown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02652653SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSin terms of job opportunities, they were less supportive of passing a lawthat specified that gays and lesbians should have equal employment rights.As such, the researcher decided to examine two different dependentvariables. The first (coverage) was coded as 1 if sexual orientation wasincluded by virtue of making reference to the law or specific contractlanguage and was coded as 0 if there was no protection based on sexualorientation. This variable was similar to Herek’s (2002) ‘general version’variable that assessed whether respondents felt that gays and lesbians shouldhave equal rights in the workplace. The resulting frequencies were 129(52.0%) and 119 (48.0%), respectively.The second dichotomous dependent variable (specific coverage) wascoded as 1 if sexual orientation was specifically identified in the non-discrimination clause of the collective agreement; otherwise, it was codedas 0. This variable was similar to Herek’s (2002) ‘law version’ variablethat assessed whether respondents believed that a law should be passedthat specified that gays and lesbians should have employment protection.As previously identified, 95 (38.3%) of the collective agreements in thesample specifically covered sexual orientation.TABLE 1Sample ClausesAnti-discrimination Variable Sample Collective Agreement Clause0 = No Coverage for Sexual No clause or “There shall be no discrimina-0 = Orientation tion against any bargaining unit employeeson account of race, colour, creed, sex, age ornational origin.” (Case 0122806, p. 14)1 = Human Rights Coverage “The employer, with respect to employmentor any term or condition of employment,discipline or discharge, agrees that it will notdiscriminate against a person as providedunder the Human Rights Code (Ontario) orby reason of his/her membership or activityin the Union.” (Case 0409607, p. 46, emphasisadded)2 = Sexual Orientation Specified “There shall be no discrimination practicesby reason of race, ancestry, place of origin,colour, ethic origin, citizenship, creed, sex,sexual orientation, age, marital status, familystatus, or handicap, as defined in section10(01) of the Ontario Human Rights Code(OHRC).” (Case 0671207, p. 1, emphasisadded)Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02653654 RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, 2003, VOL. 58, No 4Same-sex Benefits. In this sample, HRDC’s database reflected whetheragreements provided gay and lesbian partners with same-sex benefits. Inthe present case, all same-sex benefits clauses present did so through anextension of the spousal definition. For example, “the definition of spouseand dependent amended to include same sex partner and dependents ofsame sex partners” (Memorandum of Agreement, Case: 066805E, italicsadded for emphasis). As such, this variable was a dichotomous variablewhere 0 = no provision for same-sex partners and 1 = same-sex partnersincluded in spousal definition. In the present sample, only 5 (2.0%) of theagreements provided some level of same-sex benefits through such clauses.Sample same-sex benefits to which these same-sex partners were entitledincluded bereavement leave and healthcare benefits. Of these five agree-ments, 80% were Ontario agreements, 80% specifically reference sexualorientation in their discrimination language, and all had settlements datesbetween 1997–1998.RESULTSCrosstabs. Consistent with Herek (2002), an initial investigation andexamination of the hypothesized relationships was carried out usingcrosstabs. This initial investigation permitted the researcher to see whetherthere was any evidence of the hypothesized relationships before a fulllogistic regression was carried out. Table 2 includes a summary of the re-sults. Note that given the very small number of collective agreements withsame-sex benefits, crosstabs were not conducted. This is consistent withthe recommendations of Weinberg and Abramowitz (2002).TABLE 2Crosstabs Results (Pearson Chi-Square)Independent Coverage Specific CoverageVariable (Discrimination Clause (Discrimination Clausehas Sexual SpecificallyOrientation Coverage)  States Sexual Orientation)Public Sector 3.40*** 4.87***Size 2.21*** 9.11***Disability 4.45*** 1.05***Employment Equity 17.25*** 21.76***Sexual Harassment 11.47*** 14.93***Equal Pay .39*** .01***Notes:*** = significant at p < .01; ** = significant at p < .05; * = significant at p < .10Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02654655SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSHypothesis 1 stated that public sector unions would be more likelythan private sector unions to have anti-discrimination language and same-sex benefits in their collective agreements. Crosstabs revealed a relation-ship between public sector unions and sexual orientation coverage(χ2 = 3.40, p < .07) and specific coverage (χ2 = 4.87, p < .05).Hypothesis 2 stated that larger bargaining units would be more likelyto have anti-discrimination language which included sexual orientation aswell as same-sex benefits as compared to smaller bargaining units.Crosstabs did not find a relationship between larger bargaining units andsexual orientation coverage (χ2 = 2.21, p > .05). However, there was arelationship between larger bargaining units and specific coverage(χ2 = 9.11, p < .01).Hypothesis 3 predicted that collective agreements containing clausesconcerning equality issues would be more likely to have sexual orienta-tion language and same-sex benefits as compared to agreements that didnot contain these clauses. Crosstabs revealed that coverage of sexual ori-entation was negatively related to disability language (χ2 = 4.45, p < .05)and positively related to employment equity (χ2 = 17.25, p < .01) and sexualharassment (χ2 = 11.47, p < .01) clauses. Specific inclusion of sexualorientation language was positively related to agreements that included em-ployment equity (χ2 = 21.76, p < .01) and sexual harassment clauses(χ2 = 14.93, p < .01). However, no relationships were found between equalpay and sexual orientation coverage or specific coverage (χ2 = .39, p > .05;χ2 = 01, p > .05).Hypothesis 4 stated that collective agreements with anti-discrimina-tion language that provides protection based on sexual orientation are morelikely to have same-sex benefits language than those that do not. Giventhe small number of collective agreement with same-sex benefits, this couldnot be tested.Binary Logistic Regression. The results of the preceding crosstabssuggest that collective agreements were more likely to have anti-discrimination language concerning sexual orientation if these agreementswere in the public sector, were large bargaining units, and had specificclauses concerning equality issues (e.g., employment equity and sexual har-assment language). As such, binary regression was conducted to examinethe extent to which each variable increased the likelihood of anti-discrimination language pertaining to sexual orientation. Again, consist-ent with Herek (2002), two dependent variables were used, one for sexualorientation coverage and a second for specific coverage of sexual orienta-tion. The results of these regressions are presented in Tables 3 and 4,respectively.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02655656 RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, 2003, VOL. 58, No 4TABLE 3Binary Logistic Regression Results for Sexual Orientation CoverageVariable B S.E.

Thus,there was partial support for hypothesis 3.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02656657SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSTwo potential explanations for these results are as follows. First, apotential explanation for the negative relationship between coverage anddisability is industry. Many of the disability clauses (92.4%) were containedin private sector companies, which, as demonstrated in the precedingcrosstabs analyses, were less likely than public sector companies to havesexual orientation language in their collective agreement. Moreover, 66.7%of collective agreements containing this language were found in the manu-facturing, mining and construction industries where the language focusedon the option to transfer to a new job if the employee was injured. Thisfinding may simply reflect the fact that workplace accidents are more com-mon in manufacturing, mining and construction operations as opposed tothe office environments typically found in the public sector. For example,in 1998, the loss time injury rate was 5.82 per 100 employees in manufac-turing versus 2.68 in government services (HRDC 2000). As such, theseprivate sector, manufacturing, mining and construction unions may havenegotiated specific language in their agreements given the higher rates ofworkplace accidents that would require accommodation (e.g., transfer toanother role, adjusted hours of work, etc.).Second, potential explanations for the positive relationships between“coverage” and employment equity and sexual harassment are public sectorand gender. That is, the previously discussed crosstabs revealed that pub-lic sector agreements were more likely to include language concerningemployment equity and sexual harassment relative to private sector agree-ments. Moreover, the public sector has historically employed more femalesrelative to the private sector (Ponak and Thompson 2001) and females holdmore favourable attitudes towards gay and lesbian issues relative to males(Herek 2002). In addition, the works of Brown (1998) and Hunt (1997)indicated a relationship between unions with a ‘strong’ female presence(such as women’s committees) and the provisions of sexual orientationlanguage.When the dependent variable was “specific” coverage, the variablesof public sector, employment equity, and sexual harassment were signifi-cant. Consistent with hypothesis 1, the results demonstrated that publicsector bargaining units were 2.08 (p < .05) times more likely to includespecific coverage. Moreover, those agreements that had employment eq-uity and sexual harassment clauses were 3.56 (p < .01) and 2.16 (p < .01)times, respectively, more likely to provide such specific coverage. How-ever, size and disability were not significant variables in this analysis.Again, given the small number of agreements providing same-sexbenefits, binary logistic regressions were not conducted. This decision wasmade as there was limited variation in the dependent variable; thus, theassumptions of the technique would have been violated (SPSS 2001).Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02657658 RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, 2003, VOL. 58, No 4DISCUSSIONThe significance of this study is five-fold. First, this study fills a voidin the current literature. As previously stated, past studies in this area havefailed to include a substantive theoretical grounding, have not incorporatedliterature from other disciplines and have not empirically tested key rela-tionships. As such, this is the first study, to the author’s knowledge, thatempirically examines the activities of unions in the area of gay and lesbianrights. Specifically, the study examined whether collective agreements in-cluded sexual orientation in anti-discrimination language and/or providedsame-sex benefits. Moreover, the present study integrates research fromother disciplines (e.g., psychology, sociology) and uses a substantive theo-retical basis to do so (e.g., Craig’s IR system).Second, given the increased attention concerning gay and lesbianworkplace issues as seen on sitcoms such as Will & Grace and the currentdebate in Canada concerning same-sex marriages (Abbate and Lunman2002), we can expect that the workplace issues of gays and lesbians willbecome more important in the near term. As such, this research providesan initial foray into an area that will become increasingly important asorganizations become more diverse and inclusive.Third, the present study builds on the past case studies of Hunt (1997)and Brown (1998). In particular, the analyses supported many of the propo-sitions set forth by these authors. Specifically, larger bargaining units thatare based in the public sector, and have negotiated equality provisions, aremore likely to have sexual orientation included, either by reference to lawor by specific mention, in their anti-discrimination language than are privatesector units without equality provisions. Moreover, in support of Brown’s(1998) proposition that many unions first provide language prohibitingdiscrimination based on sexual orientation before moving to same-sex ben-efits, the data revealed that 52% of collective agreements provided suchprotection as compared to 2% which provided same-sex benefits.Fourth, the results of these analyses highlight the importance of a unionnegotiating equality provisions. The results, particularly the binary regres-sion analyses, demonstrated the importance of these provisions in predict-ing the likelihood of anti-discrimination language in collective agreements.This finding is important for a number of reasons. First, both Hunt (1997)and Brown (1998) discussed the importance of women’s caucuses and/orequity committees in putting forward and championing issues concerninggays and lesbians (e.g., non-discrimination clauses, same-sex benefits,awareness training, etc). The results of the present analyses support thisargument. Specifically, the results demonstrated that the presence ofemployment equity and sexual harassment clauses were significantBrown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02658659SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSpredictors of anti-discrimination language, both in terms of coverage andspecific coverage. Second, for labour leaders seeking to make inroads inthe sexual orientation arena, the present analyses suggest that bargainingunits with collective agreement clauses pertaining to equality issues (suchas employment equity and sexual harassment) would be a natural choice.Alternatively, labour leaders may seek to take several rounds of bargainingto implement sexual orientation clauses. In earlier rounds of bargaining,union leaders could ensure that supporting equality issues (e.g., employ-ment equity, sexual harassment) are covered in the collective agreement,and then in subsequent rounds start to focus on sexual orientation directly.Fifth, this paper supports Kervin’s (1992) argument that both qualita-tive and quantitative research is needed in social sciences. More specifi-cally, the paper shows how the quantitative analyses conducted in thepresent study were able to test many of the key relationships found in pastqualitative works (e.g., Hunt 1997; Brown 1998).However, the hypotheses related to same-sex benefits could not betested given the very small number of agreements that provided such ben-efits. With a larger database, and more variation in this variable, these re-lationships can be tested in the future. The recent trend to recognizesame-sex marriage indicates that Canadians’ views towards sexual orien-tation are becoming more positive. Perhaps as Canadians’ views on theissues of sexual orientation continue to become more positive, same-sexclauses will become more common in collective agreements. As such, itwould seem appropriate to re-examine these relationships in a few yearsas the HRDC data set should have incremental variation in this key variableat that time.There were two unanticipated findings in this study. First, the pres-ence of disability clauses was negatively related to sexual orientationcoverage. Second, bargaining unit size, which was significant in thecrosstabs analyses, was not significant in either of the binary logistic re-gressions. As previously discussed, a potential explanation of the disabilityfinding is that many of these disability clauses pertained to workplace in-juries and transfer options that are more common in private sector, manu-facturing, mining and construction collective agreements. Given thesignificant effect of the public sector on sexual orientation clauses, thismay be a confound in the analysis. Similarly, the null finding concerningbargaining unit size may be a factor of the data set as all bargaining unitswere relatively large (e.g., the smallest was 200 and the mean was 1992).Moreover, there may be a confound as most public sector unions are large.Hence, in the crosstabs analysis, the variable concerning large bargainingunits may have been picking up some of the variation that was actuallycaused by the public sector.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02659660 RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, 2003, VOL. 58, No 4There are five limitations to this work. First is the generalizability ofthese findings, especially those related to same-sex benefits. The smallnumber of agreements in this sample with such benefits presents a limita-tion in this study. As such, the hypotheses related to same-sex benefitsneed to be reexamined using a different data set. In addition, as previouslystated, the primary purpose of this study was to examine non-discrimina-tion clauses in collective agreements to assess the extent to which theyprovided protection based on sexual orientation. As such, the study used asample limited to collective agreements containing some language con-cerning freedom from discrimination, whether based on union involvementor human rights issues. Now that this study presents evidence concerningthe relationships between several key variables (e.g., public sector, bar-gaining unit size, equality provisions) and sexual orientation collectiveagreement provisions, research should next examine whether these rela-tionships hold true, or increase in significance, using a sample of collec-tive agreements that includes agreements with no freedom fromdiscrimination language.A second potential limitation of this study is that the presence of anti-discrimination and/or same-sex benefits provisions may have been under-represented versus the ‘true’ availability of these provisions. For example,an employer and union may agree to include sexual orientation in non-discrimination language and/or provide same-sex benefits, even if it is notspecifically mentioned in the collective agreement. Alternatively, the par-ties may agree to provide the provisions for sexual orientation, but placethem in human resource policies not contained in collective agreements.1A third potential limitation of this study is that the HRDC electronicsystem was used to identify collective agreements with discrimination lan-guage or same-sex benefits language. As such, any errors in the databasecould impact these results. A manual research of all agreements in the da-tabase would have confirmed the accuracy of the coding, particularly as itrelated to same-sex benefits. Unfortunately, the geographic distance be-tween the researcher and the library precluded this manual search. How-ever, none of the agreements that the HRDC library coded as havingdiscrimination language were found to have been incorrectly coded whenthe research assistant went to photocopy discrimination language (e.g., allagreements coded as having discrimination language were found to havesuch language). This would suggest that the system was accurate and thatagreements were correctly coded.A fourth potential limitation of this study is that multicolinearity ex-isted. Specifically, the literature review suggests that unions with a high1. The author thanks the anonymous reviewers for these suggestions.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02660661SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSpercentage of females in the social sciences disciplines would be mostsupportive of sexual orientation issues. Unions that meet this descriptionare largely located in the public sector. Unfortunately, I could not statisti-cally check for this multicolinearity issue given that the HRDC library didnot code agreements based on the percentage of bargaining unit membersthat were male/female or employed in a social science discipline. Hence,future quantitative research in this area may wish to use a survey thatmeasures these two variables versus an analysis of collective agreementprovisions.A fifth limitation of this study is that I used an analysis of collectiveagreement provisions to examine the responses of labour to issuesconcerning sexual orientation. This decision was consistent with past re-search concerning labour’s responses to issues regarding sexual orienta-tion (Brown 1998; Hunt 1997). It was also consistent with the view thatcollective agreements are “a benchmark for union ability” to gain employeerights in the workplace; thus, they represent the tangible results of unionmembership (Giles and Starkman 1995: 368). However, these agreementsdo reflect negotiations between employers and unions. Thus, we cannotignore the fact that employer willingness to agree to these provisions aswell as internal inputs (e.g., power, values, and goals of the actors) wouldinfluence whether or not sexual orientation provisions were provided inthe final collective agreement. This limitation also points out one of theweaknesses of quantitative research in that it does not permit a detailedexamination of the context and of the events being examined (Kervin 1992).As such, a future qualitative study could be conducted that examines therole of both labour and management (as well as their relative internal inputs)in an effort to understand how sexual orientation clauses become included(or are not included) in collective agreements.❚ REFERENCESABBATE, Gay, and Kim LUNMAN. 2002. “Ruling Sanctions Same-sex Unions:Definition of Marriage Violates Charter, ‘Inconsistent with ConstitutionalValues’.” The Globe and Mail, July 13, A1.BROWN, Travor C. 1998. “Sexual Orientation and the Labour Movement: AComparison of the Canadian and American Response to the Issues of Gaysand Lesbians.” Canadian Industrial Relations Association 35th AnnualConference, University of Ottawa, June 12–14.BRYDEN, Joan. 1996. “Poll Shows Support for Gay, Lesbian Rights: CanadiansIndicated in a Survey that the Majority of them want HomosexualityProtected from Discrimination.” The Vancouver Sun, April 27, A1.CRAIG, Alton W.

De fait,tous les acteurs principaux du système des relations industrielles ont abordéle problème de l’orientation sexuelle. À ce jour, une bonne partie del’information touchant les gais et les lesbiennes sur les lieux de travailconsiste en des données tirées des sites Internet, recueillies par des groupesd’homosexuels activistes (voir, par exemple, Center for Lesbian and GayCivil Rights 2000 ; Human Rights Campaign 2002 ; Stratton 2002). Il existepeu de travaux de recherche sur le rôle des syndicats qui cherchent àrépondre aux besoins des gais et des lesbiennes sur les lieux de travail. Ànotre connaissance, il n’existe que deux études en profondeur (Brown1988 ; Hunt 1997) qui analysent le rôle des syndicats canadiens touchantles questions d’orientation sexuelle sur les lieux de travail.Tout en délaissant les sentiers battus dans ce domaine, les études deHunt (1987) et de Brown (1998) comportent au moins trois lacunesimportantes. D’abord, elles ne font appel à aucun cadre de référence oumodèle qui aurait pu supporter la recherche ; elles ne font pas état de pro-positions ou hypothèses et elles n’encadrent pas les résultats obtenus.Deuxièmement, elles ne fournissent aucune vérification systématique oustatistique d’hypothèse. Ces études utilisaient plutôt l’analyse de cas àcaractère qualitatif et, partant, non-déductif écartant ainsi la possibilité devérifier des relations ou des hypothèses. Troisièmement, au moment où onsoutient que les relations industrielles constituent un champ multidis-ciplinaire (Hébert, Jain et Meltz 1988), ces travaux antérieurs n’ont pasréussi à faire appel à la contribution significative des autres disciplinespour étayer leur propre recherche. L’objectif principal de la présenterecherche est de développer de façon plus systématique les relations sug-gérées par Brown et Hunt et de les vérifier empiriquement.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02664665SEXUAL ORIENTATION PROVISIONS IN CANADIAN COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSNotre échantillon comprenait plus de 240 conventions collectives pro-venant du service de documentation de Développement des ressourceshumaines Canada. Au moment où l’échantillon fut constitué, en septembre1999, le centre possédait environ 1 076 conventions collectives couvrantles établissements de 200 employés et plus au palier provincial et de 500employés et plus au fédéral. Les dates d’expiration des conventions s’éten-daient sur la période 1993 à 2004, la date modale étant 1998.La décision de centrer notre attention sur les dispositions des conven-tions était fondée sur l’idée que ces ententes fournissaient un cadre quiguidait les rapports quotidiens des parties et, partant, reconnaissaient lesdroits des employés (Giles et Starkman 1995). Quant à la décision de re-garder de plus près les dispositions relatives à la discrimination, elle s’ins-pirait de l’idée que les syndicats cherchaient à les inclure dans lesconventions à mesure qu’ils retiraient des avantages de l’éducation de leursmembres et du fait de permettre que ces questions fassent l’objet d’unedécision exécutoire via la procédure de règlement des griefs (Giles etStarkman 1995).Vu l’état de la recherche antérieure portant sur la réaction des syndi-cats aux questions d’orientation sexuelle et vu également celui de l’opi-nion publique au Canada et aux États-Unis, les hypothèses suivantes ontfait l’objet de tests en recourant au recoupement de données et à la régres-sion logistique binaire.Première hypothèse. Comparativement aux conventions collectives dusecteur privé, celles du secteur public sont plus susceptibles de comporterdes clauses d’antidiscrimination incluant des dispositions touchant l’orien-tation sexuelle et les avantages sociaux pour les couples de même sexe.Deuxième hypothèse. Les unités d’accréditation plus vastes sont plussusceptibles d’avoir des dispositions antidiscriminatoires dans leurconvention collective qui traitent de l’orientation sexuelle et des avantagessociaux pour les couples de même sexe que les unités plus petites.Troisième hypothèse. Les conventions collectives qui contiennent desdispositions eu égard à l’égalité (équité en emploi, harcèlement sexuel,équité salariale et incapacité) sont plus susceptibles de contenir des dispo-sitions antidiscriminatoires couvrant l’orientation sexuelle et les avantagessociaux pour les couples de même sexe que les conventions ne compor-tant pas ce type de clauses.Quatrième hypothèse. Les conventions collectives comportant uneterminologie antidiscriminatoire offrant une protection fondée sur l’orien-tation sexuelle sont plus susceptibles de prévoir des avantages sociaux pourles couples du même sexe que celles qui ne contiennent pas une telleterminologie.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02665666 RELATIONS INDUSTRIELLES / INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, 2003, VOL. 58, No 4Vu le très petit nombre de conventions dans notre échantillon portantsur les avantages sociaux pour les couples du même sexe, la dernière hy-pothèse n’a pu être vérifiée. Les principales conclusions qui se dégagentde l’analyse des trois premières hypothèses montrent que les unitésd’accréditation plus vastes du secteur public, dont les conventions collec-tives font état de clauses d’égalité en emploi (harcèlement sexuel, équitéen emploi), sont plus susceptibles de présenter des dispositions interdisantla discrimination basée sur l’orientation sexuelle. Une conclusion qu’onn’avait pas prévue est à l’effet que l’occurrence de clauses d’incapacitéest reliée de façon négative à la présence de dispositions qui interdisent ladiscrimination sur la base de l’orientation sexuelle.Nous concluons cet essai en suggérant quelques avenues pour desrecherches subséquentes. D’abord, vu le petit nombre de dispositions tou-chant les avantages sociaux pour les couples de même sexe, il s’avèreimpossible de poursuivre l’analyse statistique en retenant cette variable.Au fur et à mesure que s’accroîtra le nombre de conventions comportantce type de clauses, d’autres recherches seront nécessaires pour analyserles facteurs qui viennent augmenter leur probabilité d’occurrence.Deuxièmement, l’objectif premier de cette étude consistait dans uneanalyse des dispositions antidiscriminatoires dans les conventions collec-tives en vue d’évaluer dans quelle mesure elles offraient une protectionfondée sur l’orientation sexuelle. Comme telle, l’étude a retenu un échan-tillon qui se limitait à des conventions dont les termes traitaient de la pro-tection face à la discrimination. La recherche dans le futur devrait vérifiersi les relations que nous avons établies dans la présente étude tiennent l’eau,ou bien si elles deviennent plus significatives lorsqu’on retient un échan-tillon de conventions qui comportent des ententes au plan d’une termino-logie à l’encontre de la discrimination.Troisièmement, cette étude se servait d’une analyse des dispositionsdes conventions collectives en vue d’apprécier les réactions du monde dutravail aux questions touchant l’orientation sexuelle. Encore que cesententes ne sont que le reflet des négociations entre les employeurs et lessyndicats. Nous ne pouvons alors ignorer la volonté des employeurs desouscrire à ces dispositions de même que d’autres éléments internes telsque le pouvoir, les valeurs et les buts des acteurs qui pourraient avoir unimpact ou non sur la présence dans les conventions collectives de disposi-tions quant à l’orientation sexuelle. On pourrait poursuivre l’analysequalitative en cherchant à circonscrire le rôle de la direction et du syndicatdans un effort en vue de comprendre la manière dont des dispositionstraitant de l’orientation sexuelle en viennent à être incluses ou non dansles conventions collectives.Brown-pages644.pmd 2003-12-17, 11:02666",

    "abstract": "The past decade has been marked by increased awareness\n\nconcerning employment discrimination against gays and lesbians.\n\nYet, to the author’s knowledge, there has been limited research\n\nregarding the response of Canadian labour organizations to the\n\nworkplace needs of gay and lesbian members. Limitations of these\n\nprevious studies include small sample size, lack of theoretical\n\nframework, and the absence of empirical testing of hypotheses.\n\nThe present study builds on these works through the use of Craig’s\n\nmodel, the inclusion of multi-disciplinary research, and the empirical\n\ntesting of data collected from more than 240 Canadian\n\ncollective agreements. Key findings include that larger, public\n\nsector bargaining units with equality clauses in their collective\n\nagreements were most likely also to contain clauses that prohibited\n\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation. The paper\n\nconcludes with suggestions for future research",
