INTRODUCTION\nAchieving and managing workplace diversity can be contentious work\nfor employers. As Susan Sturm's recent article asserts, \"[e]mployers face\nlegal and political challenges both for failing to diversify their workplaces\nand for diversity efforts to overcome that failure.\"' Both employers and\nemployees find themselves in an ambiguous and highly reactive landscape\nthat offers little structure within which to plan diversity initiatives. Sturm's\nthoughtful article, The Architecture of Inclusion, offers some much needed\nstructure to institutional participants engaged in the practice of making in-\nclusive environments.2 In this brief comment, we build on Sturm's work,\noffering a simple suggestion relating to the practical structure of diversity.\nOrganizational scholars-including economists, historians, legal schol-\nars, psychologists, and sociologists-tend to view institutional agents in in-\ndividual terms. These agents are sometimes understood to come together to\nproduce some group outcome or product (as suggested, for instance, by a\nteam theory of the firm),3 but bringing them within the firm at the start is\noften thought of as an individual phenomenon. Researchers, particularly\neconomists, tend to look at the hiring decision as an incentive alignment\nproblem that is favorably resolved when the interests of the parties (i.e., the\nemployers and employees) are cost-effectively served.4 However, the hiring\ndecision might usefully be informed by more than the individual incentives\nof the parties, in particular by the role of institutional structure and practice.\n\"Most recent treatments of this decision,\" to paraphrase Oliver Williamson,\n\"accord scant attention to the architecture of the firm.\"5 We show that one\n* Richard R.W.

J.L. & Gender 379 2007\nHarvard Journal of Law & Gender\nmight usefully take into account, as Sturm advocates, the structure and prac-\ntices of institutions when pursuing \"inclusive\" hiring (or diversity). 6\nWe consider a theoretical framework of diversity hiring based on the\neconomic notion of supermodularity. Specifically, we suppose a\nsupermodular hiring technology that exhibits complementarity within an en-\ndogenous variable (employed individuals) that leads to increases in the mar-\nginal return on an exogenous parameter (diversity).7 Simply put, hiring in\ngreater numbers leads to more diversity. The claim is straightforward, but it\nshould not be misinterpreted as an increasing-returns-to-scale argument,\nwhere hiring an additional person results in a higher marginal product of\ndiversity. Diversity is a group phenomenon-not an individual one-and\none might reasonably expect more diversity, we propose, when hiring agents\nare encouraged to pursue their tasks with a focus on the hires as a group.\nWe can represent the proposition more explicitly still. Let V({A} I X)\nrepresent a firm's diversity value of hiring an individual (A), given the firm's\nexisting workforce (X). If diversity is invariant to the number of persons\nhired at any one time, then V({A,B}) = V({A}) + V({B}), where X is\nsuppressed hereafter for simplicity. That is, diversity hiring is additively\nseparable in the sense that the realized diversity value of hiring A and B\ntogether is the same as the sum of the diversity value achieved by hiring\nboth separately. While plausible, we propose that diversity hiring may ex-\nhibit supermodular behavior, where V({A,B}) > V({A}) + V({B}), making\n\"cluster hiring\" more productive for this purpose than \"individual hiring.\"\nWe support this proposition with the results of a simple experimental\ndesign conducted by Purdie-Vaughns and Walton, where subjects in the con-\ntrol condition are made to hire one individual, and then a second, and then\nanother, and so on up to N (= 10) individual hires; in the experimental con-\ndition subjects are asked to hire N (= 10) individuals in one session. Evalua-\ntion of the differences in diversity between the two pools of hired\nindividuals buttresses our proposition. We describe this experiment in Part\nIII, followed by a brief discussion in Part IV. First, however, we relate our\ncomment to existing literatures in Part II. Part V briefly concludes.\nII. BACKGROUND\nTo take up this question of why cluster hiring may lead to more demo-\ngraphic diversity than individual hiring, we describe research from studies\non consumer choices and variety-seeking in consumer products. Itamar Si-\nmonson, for example, conducted a study w-here respondents were asked to\nselect from six snacks (e.g., Snickers bar, bag of chips, etc.) for their own\n6 See generally Sturm, supra note 1, at 257 (\"Change thus requires a process of\ninstitutional mindfulness.\").\n'See DONALD M. ToPKIS, SUPERMODULARITY AND COMPLEMENTARITY (1998).\n[Vol. 30\nHeinOnline  -- 30 Harv. J.L. & Gender 380 2007\nThe Supermodular Architecture of Inclusion\nconsumption over a three-week window.8 In one group participants made\ntheir selections sequentially, picking one snack in each of the three weeks.'\nIn the other group, participants had to initially select all three of their snacks,\nwhich would be distributed one in each week.'0 Simonson observed that\n\"respondents in the second group (i.e., those who made snack choices for\nthree weeks at the same time) were much more likely to select three different\nsnacks (64% of the participants) than those who made one choice each week\n(9%).\"\"1 In a related study, it was found that as the number of yogurt\ncartons purchased on a specific shopping occasion increased, consumers\nwere more likely to choose a diverse array of yogurt flavors. 2 These results\nsupported the claim that simultaneous selections yield more diversity than\nsequential selections. 3\nBoth cluster hiring and choosing products simultaneously increase the\ndiversity of the net product, but why? The drift toward choosing variety\nwhen making multiple selections simultaneously might be understood as a\npreference for difference (\"Variety is the spice of life,\" observed Simon-\nson), 14 but it might also be that simultaneity makes differences more salient.\nFaye Crosby and her colleagues designed an experiment to see if people\nwould be more attuned to gender discrimination when considering cases se-\nquentially or simultaneously.\"' They presented subjects with \"a cover story\nthat asked them to act as if they had been hired to find out whether there was\ndiscrimination in Company Z.\"6 The subjects were to consider several\ncharacteristics (e.g., job level, salary, seniority, educational background,\nmotivational ratings) of individual men and women across a number of de-\npartments within Company Z.'7 The information about the individual em-\nployees was presented to the subjects in two distinct formats, which Crosby\net al. called the \"Total Picture\" format and the \"Dribble\" format.'8 \"In the\nTotal Picture format, information was presented all at once [whereas in] the\nDribble format, the relevant information was presented one department at a\ntime.\"\"9 The subjects were significantly less likely to perceive discrimina-\ntion under the case-by-case Dribble format than they were when looking at\nI Itamar Simonson, The Effect of Purchase Quantity and Timing on Variety-Seeking\nBehavior, 27 J.

First, people may be motivated to deny\nthe existence of discrimination, and thus may defensively deny inequities\nwhen the presentation format is ambiguous. This emotional explanation\nmost readily applies to the Dribble format.22 Alternatively, simple cognitive\nfactors may impede perception of inequities when information is presented\nin a disaggregated format. 23 This second explanation-the notion that cogni-\ntive biases may heighten people's sensitivity to the way information is\npresented-is the approach we apply to our investigation of cluster hiring\nand demographic diversity.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR THE CLUSTER HIRING HYPOTHESIS\nOne means of investigating the relationship between cluster hiring and\ndemographic diversity uses the experimental methodology of social psychol-\nogy. By examining the judgments of mock employers in response to a hir-\ning simulation, researchers can control and isolate variables of interest,\nallowing for some causal inference. For example, a researcher interested in\nthe influence of ethnicity or gender on employer hiring could present partici-\npants with matched sets of resumes, which are identical but for the appli-\ncant's ethnicity or gender as signaled through some aspect of the resume,\nsuch as names, addresses, or affiliations.2 4 Similarly, a researcher interested\nin the influence of hiring structure on diversity could present participants\nwith matched resumes under different hiring structures. For instance, if par-\nticipants are asked to \"select\" candidates in groups or one at a time, any\ndifference in their subsequent judgments of the candidates may be attributed\nto the influence of the decision-making structure.\nIn light of the recent interest in increasing demographic diversity in\nuniversity settings, the lack of social science research on diversity and the\nstructure of decision-making processes is surprising. The vast majority of\nresearch emphasizes the effects of diversity on decision making, 25 individual\n20 Id. at 644-45.\n21 Id. at 645.\n22 Id. at 638.\n23 Id.\n24 See, e.g., Marianne Bertrand & Sendhil Mullainathan, Are Emily and Greg More\nEmployable Than Lakisha and Jamal?

J.L. & Gender 382 2007\nThe Supermodular Architecture of Inclusion\nand group performance, 26 and group dynamics.2 7 In short, social scientists\nhave addressed the question of whether diversity matters. To the extent that\nsocial scientists have addressed how to best increase demographic diversity,\nstrategies such as enlarging the candidate pool and improving the depart-\nmental climate have been central. Less is known about pragmatic strategies\nthat employment departments can use to increase demographic diversity.\nTheoretical models of supermodularity and complementarity, together\nwith empirical research on sequential versus simultaneous decision making,\nsuggest that cluster hiring will increase demographic diversity more than\nsingular hires. When departments cluster hire, potential inadvertent biases\nagainst women and/or minorities would be easier to detect, as suggested by\nCrosby et al. 28 Moreover, people appear to prefer variety and diversity over\nhomogeneity when making multiple choices.2 9 Finally, people may ironi-\ncally adopt a loss frame when one slot for a candidate is available as op-\nposed to a gain frame when there are multiple slots for candidates.2 0 This\nmindset may ultimately lead departments to make more conservative, and\nthus more prototypical, choices when hiring one candidate than when cluster\nhiring. For these reasons, cluster hiring may be one pragmatic and important\nway to increase demographic diversity.\nTesting for the effect of cluster hiring on demographic diversity is pre-\ncisely what Purdie-Vaughns and Walton had in mind in their examination of\nhow the structure of the hiring process might affect the degree of ethnic and\ngender diversity in organizations. Their examination took the form of a lab-\noratory experiment, which provided both a test of cluster hiring theory and\nsuggestions about which structural factors might be expected to foster demo-\ngraphic diversity.3\"\nIn this experiment, college undergraduates were asked to act as employ-\ners for a mock management consulting firm.

The set of forty resumes was designed to include the same informa-\ntion and formatting that resumes from recent graduates of business and law\nschools include: the contact information of the candidate, the university from\nwhich they graduated, overall grade point average, extracurricular activities,\nand recent work experience. This information was equivalent across re-\nsumes. Each resume was identical in the ostensible status, work experience,\nand class ranking of each candidate. The ethnic and gender diversity of the\ncandidates varied. The candidate pool-as depicted by the forty resumes-\nincluded: 60% European Americans (37.5% male), 15% African Americans\n(50% male), 15% Latinos/as (50% male), and 10% Asian Americans (50%\nmale). Ethnicity and gender were varied by changing only name and extra-\ncurricular activity of the candidate.\nIn both conditions, participants selected ten candidates to become next\nyear's management consultants. Participants selected a candidate by remov-\ning their resume from the stack of resumes, writing down the candidate's\nname in a hiring sheet, and handing over the resume to the experimenter.\nThe independent variable in this experiment was manipulated by the struc-\nture of the hiring process explained by the experimenter, either cluster or\nindividual hiring structure. In one condition, participants were asked to se-\nlect ten candidates for next year's \"incoming class of management consul-\ntants.\" This was termed the cluster hiring condition. In the other condition,\nparticipants were asked to select one candidate for next year's management\nposition. Once the participants selected a candidate, they were asked to se-\nlect one candidate again. This request was repeated until the participant se-\nlected ten candidates. This was termed the sequential hiring condition. The\nprimary dependent variables were the ethnic and gender diversity of the se-\nlected candidates.\nIt was predicted that selecting candidates in clusters would generally\nincrease the proportion of ethnic and gender diversity among the candidates\nhired, while selecting candidates sequentially would decrease the proportion\nof ethnic and gender diversity among the candidates hired. Ethnic and gen-\nder diversity were measured by calculating the percentage of ethnic minori-\nties (i.e., African Americans, Latinos/as, Asian Americans) and percentage\nof females selected.\nFigure 1 shows that the results were consistent with our predictions.\nThe degree of ethnic and gender diversity is significantly correlated with the\nstructure of the hiring process. Participants in the cluster hiring condition\nselected a greater percentage of ethnic minorities as management consultants\nthan participants in the sequential hiring condition. Participants in the clus-\nter hiring condition also selected a greater percentage of women than partici-\npants in the sequential hiring condition.\n[Vol. 30\nHeinOnline  -- 30 Harv.

DISCUSSION\nParticipants' responses to two follow-up questions provided some in-\nsight as to why cluster hiring was associated with greater ethnic and gender\ndiversity than sequential hiring. Participants in the cluster hiring condition\nwere more likely to report that they thought of their selections holistically, as\na group. More to the point, participants in the cluster hiring condition were\nmore likely than participants in the sequential hiring condition to report that\nboth ethnic and gender diversity were factors in their hiring decisions. There\nare at least two possible explanations for this, one focusing on the sequential\nhiring structure and the other on the cluster hiring structure. First, even the\nmost well-intentioned individuals have difficulty keeping track of demo-\ngraphic characteristics of others when making selections one at a time. This\nmay be a particularly important consideration in a university setting, where a\nseries of individual hiring decisions may occur months or years apart. In\nsuch situations, the demographic diversity of the candidates and the existing\nworkforce may inadvertently be forgotten. Second, the cluster-hiring struc-\nture itself may make diversity more salient to the decision maker by priming\n20071\nHeinOnline  -- 30 Harv. J.L. & Gender 385 2007\nHarvard Journal of Law & Gender\na group frame. These possibilities are neither exhaustive nor mutually ex-\nclusive. More research is needed to identify the specific mechanisms\ninvolved.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe considered a theoretical framework of diversity hiring where hiring\nagents are asked to hire groups of individuals (cluster hiring) rather than\nsingle individuals to add to a group. We proposed that diversity would be\ngreater under the former hiring strategy because diversity is a group phe-\nnomenon. Finally, evidence from laboratory experiments was presented to\nsupport our proposition.\nWe conclude with three points for further consideration. First, we see\nreal advantages from cluster hiring for employers interested in attaining\ngreater diversity. But, of course, many employers do not have the luxury of\nhiring in clusters, which may constrain the implementation of our approach.\nStill, the effects of cluster hiring may be simulated by aggregating or coordi-\nnating hires across multiple departments. By exposing hiring agents to the\nlikely composition of the group of new hires across departments before final\ndecisions are made, the priming effect of cluster hiring may be at least partly\nachieved.\nAlthough developing practices to increase demographic diversity is im-\nportant, it is worth considering whether some groups may inadvertently ben-\nefit more than others. Participants in the cluster hiring condition did not\nselect equal numbers of African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans.\nFollow-up surveys revealed that respondents overwhelmingly selected Afri-\ncan-American candidates in the cluster hiring condition. This was the case\neven though equivalent numbers of Latino and Asian-American candidates\nwere part of the candidate pool. Consistent with this result, research on\ncorporate transitions from affirmative action programs to diversity practices\nsuggests that African Americans and European-American women are the\nprimary beneficiaries of diversity practices.32 To the extent that universities\nand other employers aim to increase demographic diversity across multiple\nethnic groups and other historically under-represented groups, cluster hiring\nmay need to be conjoined with other diversity efforts.\nFinally, although the perspective of candidates was not addressed in\nthis hiring simulation, we suggest that cluster hiring may potentially im-\nprove the experience of under-represented groups in university settings. De-\npartments that hire faculty in clusters provide an immediate peer network\nsystem. New faculty may share more in common than mere demographic\ncharacteristics. Rather, they may share the experience of acclimating to the\ndepartment, establishing courses, and developing research. As Sturm noted,\n32 See Lauren B. Edelman, Sally Riggs Fuller & Iona Mara-Drita, Diversity Rhetoric\nand the Managerialization of Law, 106 Am. J. Soc. 1589 (2001).\n[Vol. 30\nHeinOnline  -- 30 Harv.
