This report explores the scope and character of foundation funding for LGBTQ issues in the calendar year 2013. This 12th annual edition of the tracking report captures data on 4,152 grants awarded by 342 foundations, making this the most comprehensive assessment of LGBTQ funding available.In 2013, foundation funding for LGBTQ issues totaled $129.1 million — a new record high for LGBTQ grantmaking! In  a year filled with several resounding victories for LGBTQ rights, including the historic Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor, record-breaking funding is just one more way that our movement continued to advance and grow. However, despite this progress, LGBTQ funding remains less than one-quarter of one percent of all foundation funding.While this year’s report is laid out similarly to 2012’s Tracking Report, there are several changes to highlight:•  To reflect the evolving scope of LGBTQ issues being funded, we added several new issue categories. We added  criminalization and criminal justice reform as well as immigration to our “civil rights” category. We also added  several sub-categories for health, expanding “other health issues” to include the following categories: cancer;  cultural competence; general health promotion and services; insurance coverage; mental health, substance abuse, and suicide prevention; primary care; and sexual and reproductive health.•  We likewise changed the way we track populations. Instead of only being able to attribute two population focuses  to each grant, we were able to code every grant for the specific populations served based on sexual orientation,  gender identity, ethnicity/race, age group, and other target populations. Thus a grant for young incarcerated trans women of color could be attributed to four different populations as opposed to our old system where this grant  would only be attributed to two populations.•  We also built upon our analysis of the types of organizations receiving funding. In this year’s report, we tabulated  both U.S. and global LGBTQ funding by the type of organization receiving funding. This year’s report features two whole sections dedicated to the types of organizations receiving funding.•  Finally, in this year’s report we have included a regional assessment of LGBTQ funding in the U.S. and a closer look  at the geographic scope of funding outside the U.S.It is my hope that this report is useful to funders, nonprofit leaders, and other stakeholders in identifying trends, gaps, and opportunities for LGBTQ grantmaking. As this report only looks at funding from U.S.-based foundations and  corporations, it only captures a portion of all giving to LGBTQ issues. Nonetheless, I hope it inspires increased funding  for LGBTQ issues and drives smart investment in LGBTQ communities.

Both the number of grants and the total amount are  new records for LGBTQ funding. The growth in 2013 represents a 6.3 percent increase from 2012, when funding for  LGBTQ issues stood at $121.4 million. Foundations also granted an additional $15.7 million to public foundations and other intermediaries for the purposes  of re-granting to LGBTQ communities, up from $12.7 million in 2012. With re-granting dollars included, LGBTQ  grantmaking totaled $144.8 million. Approximately 12 percent of funding for LGBTQ issues in 2013 was re-granted  through a funding collaborative or intermediary, demonstrating an exceptional degree of collaboration and coordination  among LGBTQ funders.The 2013 increase was driven by significant increases in investment in LGBTQ issues by a handful of funders.  In particular, growth from the Arcus Foundation and the Ford Foundation accounted for an increase of $12.5 million  in funding for LGBTQ issues. Note, grantmaking for LGBTQ issues only grew $7.6 million overall.Eight foundations in our top 20 list had big increases in LGBTQ grantmaking in 2013. Four foundations in the top 20  more than doubled their LGBTQ grantmaking: the Arcus Foundation, the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation,  Heartland Alliance for Human Needs and Human Rights, and the M.A.C. AIDS Fund. LGBTQ grantmaking at the  Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice was up by nearly 80 percent. The California Endowment and the Ford  Foundation increased their funding for LGBTQ issues by more than 30 percent, and the Tides Foundation increased  their LGBTQ funding by nearly 25 percent.LGBTQ Funding, 2004-201330,000,00060,000,00090,000,000120,000,000150,000,00020132004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 20122004 $48,772,174 2005 $58,269,914 2006 $71,336,251 2007 $80,295,279 2008  $116,181,019 2009 $96,533,298 2010 $96,829,756 2011 $123,012,4232012 $121,412,4902013 $129,112,1192013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 5In the past decade, foundation funding for LGBTQ issues has grown by over 250 percent. Foundation funding generally has grown by less than 75 percent in the same period. In 2013, grantmaking for LGBTQ issues increased by 6.3 percent, while  foundation funding in general grew by 5.6 percent.However, despite impressive gains, funding for LGBTQ issues is still a tiny fraction of all foundation funding — approximately 0.24 percent of the $54.7 billion total that the Foundation Center estimates was awarded by foundations in 2013.1  ALL FOUNDATION FUNDING  VS.

Growth was particularly pronounced among private foundations, with LGBTQ private foundations increasing  their LGBTQ grantmaking by 15 percent and non-LGBTQ private foundations increasing their LGBTQ funding by 14 percent.As in previous years, more than half of all funding for LGBTQ issues came from private foundations. In 2013, private  foundations were responsible for 54 percent of all LGBTQ funding, totaling $78.4 million. As in 2012, support from private  foundations was split roughly evenly between foundations founded by LGBTQ donors and those founded by non-LGBTQ-identified donors.Excluding dollars awarded by anonymous funders, approximately 40 percent of 2013 dollars ($51.7 million) for LGBTQ  issues were driven by LGBTQ donors, either through LGBTQ private foundations or LGBTQ public foundations. This is an  increase from 2012, when LGBTQ donors were responsible for 36 percent of the funding.Sources of LGBTQ Grant Dollars by Funder Type12% Anonymous Funders  ($17,342,000) 4% Community Foundations  ($5,938,076)7% Corporations  ($9,686,649)28% Non-LGBTQ  Private Foundations  ($40,308,984)26% LGBTQ  Private Foundations  ($38,091,487)11% LGBTQ Public Foundations  ($16,300,821)12% Other Public Foundations  ($17,194,396)TOTAL ($144,862,413)15% Anonymous Funders ($20,395,810) 4% Community Foundations ($5,498,826)7% Corporations ($8,994,372)26% Non-LGBTQ Private Foundations ($35,385,402 )25% LGBTQ Private Foundations ($33,051,913)11% LGBTQ Public Foundations ($14,920,707)12% Other Public Foundations ($15,834,128)TOTAL ($134,081,158)20122013Note: In contrast to other parts of this report, this section includes dollars awarded to public foundations for the purposes of re-granting.

As such, national work continued to receive the largest proportion of funding, even as funding for national work  decreased by nearly $7 million.  Funding for regional, statewide,  and local work all increased in 2013.Funding for organizations and projects based outside the U.S. also increased, by $4.4 million. This year,  we have provided a more detailed look at the geographic focus of  funding outside the U.S.. We have noted where grantmaking was truly international scope and where it  was awarded for national, regional,  or local work outside the U.S.Distribution of LGBTQ Grant Dollars by Geographic Focus20122013  TYPE OF  SUPPORTMore than two-thirds of LGBTQ  funding (68 percent) was devoted  to program support in 2013. There was an increase in both the total  dollar amount and the proportion  of grant dollars awarded for program support. More than half of the  funding attributed to the “other”  category was scholarships.  Scholarships accounted for $2.5  million, amounting to approximately  2 percent of LGBTQ funding.When it comes to number of  grants, there was a more even divide  between program and general  operating support. In 2013, 47  percent of grants were awarded for program support, while 43 percent of grants where awarded for general operating support.Distribution of LGBTQ Grant Dollars by Type of Support68% Program/ Project Support  ($87,410,187) 28% General  Operating Support  ($36,465,436)4% Other  ($5,236,496)TOTAL ($129,112,119)61% Program/ Project Support ($73,911,513) 37% General Operating Support ($44,453,343)2% Other ($3,047,634)TOTAL ($121,412,490)20122013Note: This year, for the first time, we provide a more detailed analysis of the geographic focus of global  LGBTI funding. “International” funding was global in focus for activities that addressed LGBTQ issues at the international level, such as advocacy for greater inclusion of LGBTI communities in international law and  in the policies of major international bodies, such as the United Nations. Funding “Outside the U.S.” was  for services and advocacy in countries around the world, generally focused on a specific locality, country,  or region of multiple countries.2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations10  POPULATION FOCUSWhile the majority of grants were awarded to support the LGBTQ community broadly, the data below looks at grants that specifically targeted one segment of the LGBTQ community.Two areas of noticeable change were funding for gay men and funding for transgender communities. Funding specifically targeting gay men declined by nearly $1 million. Funding for transgender communities increased by more than $2.5 million, reaching a new record of $8.3 million. Of particular note was the launch of the Trans Justice Funding Project and a $1.35 million grant awarded by the Tawani Foundation to the Palm Center to study transgender military service.ZOOMING IN: Domestic Funding Targeting Transgender PeopleIn 2013, domestic funding for transgender communities increased to $6.4 million from $3.6 million in 2012. Besides  the large grant from the Tawani Foundation, this growth was in part due to an increase in the number of grants for transgender issues. The number of grants for transgender issues increased from 184 in 2012 to 213 grants in 2013.  Notably, 2013 was the first year the Trans Justice Funding Project began its funding, awarding 22 grants to different trans-led organizations.Distribution of LGBTQ Grant Dollars by Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity = $100,000Lesbians/Queer Women $3,302,053 (3%)Gay Men/Queer Men/MSM $8,673,549 (7%)Bisexuals $474,650 (<1%)Transgender People  $8,310,434 (6%)Intersex People  $285,200 (<1%)2013 = $100,000Lesbians/Queer Women $3,990,145 (3%)Gay Men/Queer Men/MSM $9,532,329 (8%)Bisexuals $452,251 (<1%)Transgender People  $5,329,181 (4%)Intersex People  $195,051 (<1%)20122013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 11  STRATEGIES FUNDEDAdvocacy continued to be the most funded strategy, with nearly half of all LGBTQ funding going to some form of advocacy work.While most strategies were funded with similar numbers in 2013 as in 2012, one notable exception is funding for direct services, which increased by more than $6 million.

With dollars for re-granting included, total domestic funding was nearly $115 million. The top ten funders  collectively awarded over $64 million, more than half the total. The top 10 domestic grant recipients received nearly  $23 million, or about 22 percent of the total. Local and state-level funding reached $55.6 million, a 20 percent increase from 2012. This more locally focused funding was less reliant on a small number of funders: the top ten funders provided about 38 percent of local and state-level LGBTQ funding. The top local and state grant recipients captured more than  $11 million, or about one-fifth of geographically targeted domestic grant dollars.Top Ten Domestic Funders1 Ford FoundationNew York, NY   $12,955,289 2 AnonymousVarious locations   $12,535,0003 Arcus FoundationNew York, NY   $9,528,5384 Gill FoundationDenver, CO   $7,103,725 5  Evelyn & Walter  Haas, Jr. FundSan Francisco, CA   $5,988,025 6 Pride FoundationSeattle, WA   $5,137,467 7  Wells Fargo FoundationSan Francisco, CA   $3,650,3688 Tides FoundationSan Francisco, CA   $2,890,528 9  H. van Ameringen  FoundationNew York, NY   $2,439,000 10  The California  EndowmentLos Angeles, CA   $1,994,885Top Ten Domestic  Grantees1 Freedom To MarryNew York, NY   $3,575,7722  National LGBTQ Task ForceWashington, DC   $3,215,298 3  Services and Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Elders (SAGE)New York, NY   $2,619,858 4  Lambda Legal Defense  and Education FundNew York, NY   $2,514,461 5  National Center for  Lesbian Rights (NCLR)San Francisco, CA   $2,222,200 6  American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (ACLU)New York, NY   $2,151,0007  Gay & Lesbian Advocates  & Defenders (GLAD)Boston, MA   $2,087,900 8  The Lesbian, Gay,  Bisexual & Transgender  Community CenterNew York, NY   $1,598,1089 Palm CenterSan Francisco, CA    $1,485,00010  Human Rights  Campaign FoundationWashington, DC   $1,449,948 Top Ten Funders  for Local and  State-Level Work1 AnonymousVarious locations   $3,385,000 2 Arcus FoundationNew York, NY   $3,035,300 3 Ford FoundationNew York, NY   $2,730,000 4 Tides FoundationSan Francisco, CA   $2,331,6895  The California  EndowmentLos Angeles, CA   $1,994,8856 Gill FoundationDenver, CO   $1,703,500 7  Proteus Fund – Civil  Marriage CollaborativeAmherst, MA   $1,675,000 8  Wells Fargo FoundationSan Francisco, CA   $1,642,324 9  Harry and Jeanette  Weinberg FoundationOwing Mills, MD$1,600,000 10  Evelyn & Walter  Haas, Jr. FundSan Francisco, CA   $1,512,000Top Ten Grantees  for Local and State-Level Work1  Gay & Lesbian Advocates  & Defenders (GLAD)Boston, MA   $2,087,900 2  The Lesbian, Gay,  Bisexual & Transgender Community CenterNew York, NY   $1,598,1083  Services and Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Elders (SAGE)New York, NY   $1,545,358 4 Basic Rights OregonPortland, OR   $1,330,906 5  Los Angeles LGBTQ CenterLos Angeles, CA   $927,4406  Family Builders  By AdoptionOakland, CA   $900,0007  Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) – Washington State ChapterSeattle, WA   $827,616 8  Hetrick-Martin  Institute, Inc.New York, NY   $824,628 9 Western States CenterPortland, OR   $813,00010  San Francisco AIDS  FoundationSan Francisco, CA   $783,2132013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations14 LOCAL AND STATEWIDE FUNDING OF LGBTQ ISSUESFunding for local, statewide, and regional LGBTQ work in  the U.S. surpassed $55 million in 2013, a record high. As in previous years, the Northeast region captured the largest share of dollars, nearly $20 million. The Pacific states were not far behind, receiving nearly $16 million in 2013. All five major regions of the country saw significant increases in funding, but none so much as the South, which saw a 70 percent increase, from $4.7 million to more than $8 million.In our effort to continue capturing the purpose of LGBTQ grant dollars with as much precision as possible, this year  we tracked the target state of each grant. For the most part, the target state was the same as the home state of the grantee, but in some cases an organization was funded to do work outside its home state. We also tracked when grants were intended for use across a region of several states, which are shown accordingly in the table below  (e.g., “Midwest Region (General)”).As was the case last year, California and New York received total grant dollar amounts that far exceed any other state. This year, California took the top spot from New York,  garnering more than $11 million to New York’s $9.8 million. Together, these two states alone captured more than 37 percent of all locally targeted domestic LGBTQ grant dollars.Thirteen states received more than $1 million, compared  to only ten states that broke the $1 million mark in  2012. Michigan was the only state to fall off the “million-dollar-club,” receiving only $680,000 in 2013 compared  to $1.3 million in 2012. The four new states to join the  million-dollar-club in 2013 were Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the District of Columbia, each of which saw significant increases in funding from 2012. In the case of Maryland, the increase was driven almost entirely by a large grant from the Weinberg Foundation for SAGE to develop service systems for LGBTQ adults and their caregivers in  the Baltimore area. The increases in Pennsylvania and Ohio were driven in part by funder investment in advancing  nondiscrimination protections in those states. Funding from the Cleveland Foundation and others for the Gay Games  in Cleveland also helped boost Ohio’s total in 2013.From 2012 to 2013, more than a dozen states saw a  doubling or more in total LGBTQ grant dollars received.  Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and West Virginia all saw their funding more than quadruple. Funding more than doubled in Alabama,  Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Tennessee.. Most of these states are in the Midwest, the Mountain  states, or the South, reflecting growing funder investment  in those under-resourced regions.Maine saw the most dramatic decrease in funding, falling from $863,000 to less than $100,000. Maine’s high total in 2012 was due largely to funding for the marriage equality campaign in the state that year.LGBTQ Funding, by Region 2013 2012 % IncreaseMidwest $8,638,104 $7,279,106 19%Mountain $2,971,656 $2,377,308 25%Northeast $19,981,142 $18,472,442 8%Pacific $15,978,200 $13,345,581 20%South $8,058,704 $4,742,238 70%TOTAL $55,628,806 $46,216,675 20%2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 15Midwest $8,638,104Illinois $2,833,973Indiana $111,450Iowa $303,391Kansas $2,000Michigan $684,273Minnesota $1,833,623Missouri $324,469Nebraska $201,000North Dakota —Ohio $1,568,201South Dakota $16,000Wisconsin $537,224Midwest Region (General) $222,500Mountain $2,971,656Arizona $229,238Colorado $906,211Idaho $103,300Montana $191,932Nevada $307,653New Mexico $583,596Utah $624,725Wyoming $25,000Mountain Region (General) — Northeast $19,981,142Connecticut $268,473Delaware $160,000District of Columbia $1,958,074 Maine $94,386Maryland $1,698,245Massachusetts $1,577,859New Hampshire $1,000New Jersey $365,397New York $9,798,500Pennsylvania $1,578,483Rhode Island $266,200Vermont $127,625Northeast Region (General) $2,087,900Pacific $15,978,200Alaska $19,450California $11,052,534Hawaii $234,000Oregon $2,160,685Washington $1,943,228Pacific Northwest Region (General) $438,303 South $8,058,704Alabama $103,500Arkansas $23,000Florida $1,604,575Georgia $672,088Kentucky $121,750Louisiana $479,907Mississippi $170,000North Carolina $987,966Oklahoma $55,000South Carolina $73,115Tennessee $144,900Texas $1,386,676Virginia $425,637West Virginia $200,000Southern Region (General) $1,610,589Grand Total $55,628,806 Local and Statewide Funding of LGBTQ Issues, by State$3,500,000 – $12,000,000$1,000,000 – $3,499,999$500,000 – $999,999$100,000 – $499,999$50,000 – $99,999$15,000 – $49,999$1 – $14,999$02013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations16  FUNDING PER LGBT ADULTTo assess the level of funding for each state relative to  its population, we have again provided a GDQ or “Grant  Dollars per Queer” estimate based on the total grant dollars in each state divided by the estimated number of adults  in the state who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or  transgender. Since local and statewide funding for LGBTQ communities increased, the national average of local  dollars per LGBTQ adult increased more than a dollar  from $5.52 to $6.57. The median for statewide and local funding per LGBTQ  adult also increased. In 2013 the median for the 50 states and the District of Columbia was $3.50 versus $2.06 in 2012. In 2013, thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia saw an increase in the amount of foundation dollars they received per LGBTQ adult. Thirteen states saw a decrease. The District of Columbia had the largest GDQ at $37.45  followed by last year’s leader, New York, with a GDQ of $16.85. Two states and the District of Columbia had per capita funding exceeding $15, an additional four states  had per capita funding exceeding $10, and an additional eleven states had per capita funding exceeding $5. The District of Columbia had the largest per capita funding increase, going from $10.01 to $37.45 per LGBT adult.  Maryland had the second largest increase, going from $3.10 to $11.33. Maine experienced the largest decrease, going from a GDQ of $16.98 to $1.85.Regionally, the Northeast and Pacific continue to have  the highest GDQ, at $11.04 and $10.07 respectively. The  Midwest and Mountain region continue to have a GDQ around $5. While the GDQ in the South has improved by more than $1 from $1.78 in 2012, it is still far below both the national average and median at $2.97. All regions showed increases in GDQ in 2013.LGBTQ Funding Per LGBT Adult, by Region 2013 2012 % IncreaseMidwest  $4.85  $4.11 18%Mountain  $5.21  $4.23 23%Northeast  $11.04  $10.30 7%Pacific  $10.07  $8.52 18%South  $2.97  $1.78 66%NATIONAL AVERAGE $6.57 $5.52 19%RECOMMENDED RESOURCE: The Williams InstituteOur estimates of “LGBT Funding Per Capita” for each U.S. state draw on research from the Williams Institute, which has worked in collaboration with Gallup and others to develop some of the best data available on LGBT demographics  and trends.

Most of these dollars were devoted to civil rights generally, a category that includes general operating support for organizations that broadly advocate for LGBTQ rights, such as the National LGBTQ Task Force or state equality  organizations. Support decreased for two specific LGBTQ rights issues: marriage equality funding fell by 22 percent, and  general funding for gender identity rights fell by 27 percent. Funding for military inclusion more than quadrupled, almost  entirely because of a grant from the Tawani Foundation to the Palm Center for research on transgender inclusion in the  military. This year, we began tracking funding for criminalization and criminal justice reform and immigration, which each captured more than $1 million. Community, families, and visibility was the category that captured the second-largest share of dollars: $27 million, or more than one-quarter of the total. This is a marked increase from 2012, largely because this category includes grant dollars that were previously categorized as “Multi-Issue,” a less defined category that we are now seeking to use more minimally. Within “community, families, & visibility,” more than $11.5 million was devoted to community-building and empowerment, which includes general support of community centers, youth leadership development programs, and other broad efforts to build community and empower LGBTQ people. Another $8 million was devoted to visibility, which includes support for pride  parades, LGBTQ theaters and films, and other cultural events that raise the visibility of LGBTQ communities but do not focus  on any specific issue. (Funding for a documentary on LGBTQ people in the military would be categorized as “Military,” but  funding for film festival featuring a range of LGBTQ themes would be categorized as “Visibility.”)Funding for LGBTQ health issues increased by more than $2 million, exceeding $18 million in 2013. About 43 percent of health funding was devoted specifically to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment targeting gay men and men who have sex with men and transgender people. This year, we began breaking down LGBTQ health funding in greater detail, and found that more than $1 million was devoted to several sub-issues: general health services, primary care, insurance coverage (including enrollment and outreach related to the Affordable Care Act), mental and behavioral health (including suicide prevention), and cancer (primarily breast cancer). We will provide a detailed analysis of LGBTQ health funding in a forthcoming report in early 2015.The fourth most funded issue in 2013 was education and safe schools, which received nearly $8 million, a four percent increase from 2012. ISSUES ADDRESSED IN DOMESTIC FUNDINGZOOMING IN: Marriage Equality Funding for the StatesIn 2013, about one-third of marriage equality funding ($3,125,000) went to efforts to advance the freedom to marry  at the state level. Oregon was the top-funded state, capturing $957,000, followed by Minnesota at $435,000. Eight  other states received $100,000 or more in marriage equality funding in 2013: New Mexico, Iowa, Hawaii, Delaware,  Illinois, California, and Ohio. As of this writing in late 2014, all of these states have since won the freedom to marry,  with the exception of Ohio, where a court case is pending.ZOOMING IN: Criminalization and Criminal Justice ReformIn the United States, about $1.2 million was granted to LGBTQ criminal justice reform and criminalization issues.  This was the first year we have tracked grants in this category. Only 13 grantees and 6 states received funding for this work domestically, with the majority of anti-criminalization funding going to grassroots organizations in New York ($787,970), Illinois ($265,500), and Louisiana ($126,900).2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 19Detailed Breakdown of Issues Addressed in Domestic Funding 2013 2012Civil Rights and Human Rights $42,207,429 40% $43,947,995 43%Civil Rights (General/Other) $26,832,964 26%  $29,131,284 29%Criminalization and Criminal Justice Reform $1,201,870 1% N/AGender Identity Rights $1,967,239 2%  $2,681,927 3%Immigration $1,408,886 1% N/AMarriage and Civil Unions $9,167,522 9%  $11,742,736 11%Military Inclusion $1,628,948 2%  $392,048 <1%Strengthening Communities, Families, and Visibility $27,017,698 26%  $13,571,754 13%Community Building and Empowerment $11,539,542 11%  $4,480,090 4%Religion $2,994,449 3%  $2,131,198 2%Strengthening Families $4,343,911 4%  $2,217,035 2%Visibility $8,139,797 8%  $4,743,431 5%Health and Well-being $18,094,633 17%  $15,956,529 16%Cancer $1,148,554 1%  $1,120,699 1%Cultural competence $687,385 1%  $302,800 <1%General Health Promotion and Services $3,267,343 4% $2,745,579 3%HIV/AIDS $7,708,263 7%  $6,913,150 7%Insurance Coverage $1,244,275 1%  $1,600,000 2%Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide Prevention $1,351,431 1%  $1,821,780 2%Primary Care $1,603,669 2%  $1,261,954 1%Sexual and Reproductive Health $540,914 1%  $190,567 0%Education and Safe Schools $7,991,389 8% $7,668,385 8%Economic Issues $3,413,860 3% $3,958,558 4%Housing and Homelessness $1,554,220 1%  $2,261,218 2%Labor and Employment $1,859,641 2%  $1,697,340 2%Violence, Homophobia, and Transphobia $1,291,300 1%  $4,512,718 5%Anti-Violence $1,011,500 1%  $1,200,554 1%Homophobia and Transphobia $279,800 0%  $3,312,164 3%Other Issues $4,470,934 4%  $11,571,080 11%Multi-Issue $1,954,768 2%  $10,347,156 10%Philanthropy $2,137,081 2%  $978,873 <1%Unspecified $379,084 <1%  $243,051 <1%TOTAL  $104,487,244  $101,187,019 2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations20 DOMESTIC POPULATION FOCUSSimilar to past years, the majority of domestic grant dollars (84 percent) went to organizations and programs that serve LGBTQ people generally, totaling $88,237,344.This year, we changed the way we track target populations, allowing us to have a more detailed view of funding for specific and intersecting populations. Instead of only being able to attribute two population focuses per grant, we were able to  expand our coding to include every specific population served based on sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity/race, age group, and other population associations. Thus, a grant for young incarcerated trans women of color could be attributed to four different populations as opposed to our old system where this grant would only be attributed to two populations.  This resulted in much more accurate calculations of funding for specific populations.In 2013, communities of color received $20.2 million, or about 19 percent of all domestic funding for LGBTQ issues. The Top  10 funders of communities of color, including Ford Foundation, Gill Foundation, various Anonymous funders, Evelyn and  Walter Haas Jr. Fund, Susan G. Komen Foundation, Paul Rapoport Foundation, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation,  Elton John AIDS Foundation, and Liberty Hill Foundation, accounted for 71% of funding for LGBTQ people of color. The Arcus Foundation, in line with its new strategy to deepen its commitment to communities of color, was the top funder of LGBTQ communities of color, granting almost $5 million. Funding for transgender communities grew to $6.4 million in 2013. This was in part due to a large $1.35 million grant to the Palm Center from the Tawani Foundation to study transgender people in the military. Over half the funding for transgender communities was for non-trans-specific organizations. Transgender organizations received $2.8 million, or 44 percent of  funding for transgender issues.ZOOMING IN: Domestic Funding Targeting Gay Men and Lesbians by IssueOften, grants targeting specific populations are health-related. Of domestic grant dollars targeting gay and bisexual men and men who have sex with men (MSMs), 85 percent was for HIV/AIDS. Of domestic grant dollars targeting  lesbians, bisexual women, and women who have sex with women, about 48 percent was for breast cancer.RECOMMENDED RESOURCE: Funders Concerned About AIDS For more information about funding for HIV/AIDS, we recommend “Philanthropic Support to Address HIV/AIDS,”  the annual report produced by our sister affinity group, Funders Concerned About AIDS. The report on 2013 funding finds that only about one-fifth of domestic HIV funding specifically targets LGBT communities — even though men who have sex with men and transgender people account for more than two-thirds of new infections in the U.S.  The report can be viewed at www.fcaaids.org.2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 21Distribution of Domestic Grant Dollars by Sexual Orientation and Gender IdentityLesbians/Queer Women $2,298,551 (2%)Gay/Queer Men/MSM $3,910,026 (4%)Bisexuals $474,650 (<1%)Transgender People $6,448,133 (6%)Intersex People $75,200 (<1%)2013 = $100,000ZOOMING IN: Target Population and Organization TypeOf the $4.7 million in domestic LGBTQ funding focused on economically disadvantaged populations, 48 percent  went to service providers and 36 percent went to advocacy organizations.

NON-LGBTQ ORGANIZATIONSOf the approximately $102.4 million in domestic funding awarded to organizations, approximately $72.5 million  (71 percent) was awarded to LGBTQ organizations — defined as organizations whose organizational mission explicitly  focuses on LGBTQ issues. The remaining $29.8 million (29 percent) was awarded to non-LGBTQ organizations that  received funding for LGBTQ-specific programs, campaigns, or outreach efforts. Examples of non-LGBTQ grantee  organizations include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for American Progress, and Columbia University.This represents a slight increase in the percentage of funds awarded to non-LGBTQ-specific organizations, which  captured one-quarter of domestic grant dollars in 2012.Note: These figures do not include approximately $2 million awarded to individuals (largely for scholarships).Distribution of Domestic Grant Dollars by Recipient TypeLGBTQ Organizations $72,545,394 (71%)Non-LGBTQ Organizations $29,804,869 (29%)TOTAL ($102,350,264)  = 1%2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations24As with last year, we categorized all LGBTQ grantees into a detailed taxonomy. This year’s updated taxonomy was further refined based on our recent detailed scan of  LGBTQ organizations in the U.S. South. In particular,  several categories of grassroots organizations were added  to the taxonomy, so as to more fully reflect the range  of ways that LGBTQ communities are organizing and  building institutions.As in 2012, advocacy organizations captured the largest share of dollars, accounting for nearly half (49 percent) of  all grant dollars awarded to domestic LGBTQ organizations. National advocacy organizations alone captured more than $15 million, more than any other sub-category. LGBTQ  legal organizations received more than $10.1 million, nearly  double the $5.6 million they received in 2012. Funding  for state-level LGBTQ advocacy organizations also saw  an increase in 2013, receiving $8.7 million, a 50-percent increase from 2012, when they received $5.8 million.  In part, these sharp increases reflect the response of  leading LGBTQ funders to the vast number of legal cases and state-level policy battles in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision overturning part of the Defense  of Marriage Act.LGBTQ service providers again received the second largest share of grant dollars, capturing $19.4 million (27 percent of the total), a level similar to 2012. Of the sub-types of service providers, LGBTQ community centers again captured the largest amount of dollars, slightly more than $6 million  total. Health centers, HIV/AIDS organizations, youth service providers, and organizations serving older adults each  captured between $2 million and $3.5 million.About $9.1 million was awarded to LGBTQ infrastructure organizations, or organizations whose primary focus is conducting research or providing services for other  organizations. LGBTQ research institutes received about  $4.3 million, and technical assistance providers and  networks (such as CenterLink, Equality Federation, and Funders for LGBTQ Issues) received a total of $2.3 million.About $5.7 million went to grassroots LGBTQ groups —  a wide range of organizations that bring together LGBTQ  communities, often both providing support for their  members as well as educating the wider community  about LGBTQ issues. Of the sub-categories of grassroots groups, faith-based communities received the largest share, about $1.6 million. GSA networks, associations of LGBTQ professionals and business leaders, and family groups  (such as PFLAG chapters and local LGBTQ parent groups) also garnered significant grant dollars, each receiving  nearly $800,000 or more.Arts and cultural organizations (including LGBTQ choruses, film festivals, and theaters) received a total of $2.5 million, almost identical to the 2012 amount.RECOMMENDED RESOURCE: The Movement Advancement Project (MAP)Our taxonomy of LGBT-focused nonprofit organizations borrows in part from ongoing research by the Movement  Advancement Project on the capacity of the LGBT movement. MAP’s 2014 National LGBT Movement Report found  that leading LGBT nonprofits experienced a 7 percent revenue increase from 2012 to 2013, paralleling this report’s  finding that foundation funding for LGBTQ issues grew by more than 6 percent.

The distribution of grant dollars among sub-types of allied advocacy organization  parallels that of the LGBTQ advocacy organizations: the  largest share goes to national allied advocacy organizations, followed by legal organizations (most notably the ACLU),  and then state-level organizations, with much smaller shares of dollars devoted to organizations working at the local and regional levels. Among non-LGBTQ organizations, the second-largest  amount of grant dollars ($4.9 million) went to mainstream infrastructure organizations. Most of these dollars were awarded to research institutes (such as the Public Religion Research Institute) or to technical assistance providers (such  as the Rockwood Leadership Institute or the Management  Assistance Group). More than $4 million was awarded to mainstream service providers, including $1.6 million to HIV/AIDS service  organizations and almost $2.4 million awarded to other  service providers, ranging from large hospitals to local YWCAs, seeking to increase their inclusiveness of LGBTQ populations.Other non-LGBTQ organizations garnering significant  grant dollars in 2013 included universities ($3.1 million),  arts and cultural organizations ($2.3 million), and faith-based institutions ($1.2 million).

An additional $5.3 million were awarded to intermediaries  for international re-granting — which has been deducted from the grand total so as to avoid double-counting. Global LGBTI funding continues to be especially reliant on a fairly small pool of funders giving at high levels. The  top ten U.S. funders of global LGBTI issues awarded a total of more than $27.7 million, or 93 percent of the total  (with re-granting dollars included). The top three funders alone (Arcus, Open Society, and anonymous funders)  awarded $16.3 million, providing the majority (54 percent) of the year’s global LGBTQ grantmaking. In 2013, two of the top ten global LGBTI grantees were based in Sub-Saharan Africa, marking the first time that  organizations based in the global South have been among the top 10 global LGBTI grant recipients. Note that the data in this section only includes funding from foundations, corporations, and nonprofit funders  based in the U.S. It does not include LGBTI funding awarded by foundations and funding institutions outside the U.S.,  nor does it include bilateral funding from government agencies. We will seek to capture a more complete picture of  global LGBTI funding in a new report in 2015.2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations28 GLOBAL GEOGRAPHIC FOCUSThis year, for the first time, we provide a more detailed  analysis of the geographic focus of global LGBTI funding. Broadly, global LGBTI funding falls into two categories: •  International funding, for activities that address LGBTQ issues at the international level, such as advocacy for greater inclusion of LGBTI communities in international law and in the policies of major international bodies, such as the United Nations. This accounted for 44 percent of global LGBTI funding in 2013.•  Funding outside the U.S., for services and advocacy  in countries around the world, generally focused on a  specific locality, country, or region of multiple countries. This accounted for 56 percent of global LGBTI funding  in 2013.Note that the vast majority (84 percent) of international-level funding was awarded to organizations based in the U.S. and Western Europe. In contrast, 96 percent of funding for LGBT work at the regional, national, or local level outside the U.S. went to organizations based in the Global South and East, with only a small fraction going to Western Europe, Canada, and other nations of the Global North.Overall, more than one-third of funding for global LGBTI work (approximately $8.4 million) went to organizations based in the United States, for work addressing LGBTQ  issues at the international level. Sub-Saharan Africa received the second largest share of funding, nearly $6.9 million,  or about one-quarter of the total. No other region of the world received more than $3 million.44% International  ($10,932,465) 56% Outside the U.S.  ($13,692,410)11% Regional (Multiple Countries)  ($2,699,972)38% National  ($9,266,944)7% Local  ($1,725,493)TOTAL ($24,624,875)Distribution of Global LGBTQ Grant Dollars by Geographic Focus20132013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 29Detailed Breakdown of Issues Addressed in Global Funding 2013 2012Civil Rights and Human Rights $12,718,582 52% $13,232,761 65%Criminalization and Criminal Justice Reform $130,000 1% N/AGender Identity Rights $1,466,712 6%  $914,546 5%Human Rights (General) $10,395,742 42% $12,318,215 61%Marriage and Civil Unions $96,628 <1% $0 0%Migration and Displacement $629,500 3% N/AStrengthening Communities, Families, and Visibility $2,094,331 9% $1,551,380 8%Community Building and Empowerment $721,185 3% $492,771 2%Religion $255,385 1% $315,675 2%Strengthening Families $150,761 1% $0 0%Visibility $967,000 4% $742,934 4%Health and Well-being $6,579,881 27% $3,637,579 18%Cultural Competence $10,000 <1% N/AGeneral Health Promotion and Services $669,310 3% $806,667 4%HIV/AIDS $4,232,785 17%  $2,830,912 14%Mental Health, Substance Abuse and Suicide Prevention $437,786 2% N/ASexual and Reproductive Health $1,230,000 5% N/AEducation and Safe Schools $507,000 2% $0 0%Economic Issues $140,000 1% $0 0%Labor and Employment $140,000 1% $0 0%Violence, Homophobia, and Transphobia $1,487,852 6%  $781,078 4%Anti-Violence $672,500 3%  $320,415 2%Homophobia and Transphobia $815,352 3%  $460,663 2%Other Issues $1,097,228 4% $1,057,673 5%Multi-Issue and Unspecified $997,578 4% $569,723 3%Philanthropy $99,650 <1% $487,950 2%TOTAL $24,624,875 $20,621,555 ISSUES ADDRESSED IN GLOBAL FUNDINGAs in prior years, broad efforts to advance human rights captured the largest share of global LGBTQ grant dollars ($12.7  million) — though this category saw a decrease both as a share of the total and in raw grant dollars. Efforts related specifically to gender identity rights increased by more than 50 percent, nearly reaching $1.5 million. Global funding for LGBTQ health  also saw a significant increase, capturing $6.6 million or more than one-quarter of the total. More than $500,000 was also awarded for LGBTQ education issues in 2013 — an issue that previously had not seen significant funding at the global level.2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,

GLOBAL POPULATION FOCUSGlobal LGBTQ funding specifically targeting gay men reached $4.7 million in 2013, an increase of 77 percent over 2012. Global funding for transgender communities and intersex communities also saw increases, reaching nearly $2 million and $200,000, respectively. Funding targeting lesbians and women who have sex with women was down significantly, from $1.7 million in 2012 to $1 million in 2013. We found no global funding specifically targeting bisexuals in 2013, though a significant portion  of funding targeting gay men was broadly inclusive of gay men, bisexual men, and men who have sex with men. Looking at other populations specifically targeted by global LGBTQ funding, the largest share ($1.7 million) went to  refugees, asylees, and migrants, more than double the amount that targeted that population in 2012. Children and youth  received the second-largest share of dollars and also saw an increase, reaching $1.3 million. Economically disadvantaged  LGBTQ communities and sex workers saw sharp increases, but still only received a fairly small share of international LGBTQ grant dollars. Small amounts of funding had targeted older adults and people with disabilities in 2012, but no international grant dollars explicitly targeted these populations in 2013.ZOOMING IN: Target Population and StrategyOf the $1.7 million focused on refugees, asylees, and migrants, 90 percent was for advocacy and research,  and 9 percent was for capacity-building and training. Of the $1.3 million for children and youth, 67 percent was  for advocacy and 23 percent was for direct services.RECOMMENDED RESOURCE: International Human Rights Funders Group (IHRFG)For more information on human rights funding, we recommend “Advancing Human Rights: The State of Global  Foundation Grantmaking,” produced by IHRFG and the Foundation Center. The most recent report found that  foundations awarded $1.7 billion for human rights in 2011, of which about 5 percent ($79.6 million) targeted  LGBT populations.

NON-LGBTQ ORGANIZATIONSThis year, for the first time, we provide a breakdown of the types of organizations receiving funding for international  LGBTQ issues. About 72 percent of international dollars go to LGBTQ-specific organizations, while the remaining  28 percent was awarded to non-LGBTQ organizations and agencies to implement LGBTQ-related programs. This is  quite similar to the domestic ratio of funding for LGBTQ vs. non-LGBTQ organizations.Note: These figures do not include approximately $13,000 awarded to individuals and approximately $1 million awarded to anonymous organizations.Distribution of Domestic Grant Dollars by Recipient TypeLGBTQ Organizations $16,961,400 (72%)Non-LGBTQ Organizations $6,512,684 (28%)TOTAL ($23,474,084)  = 1%2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 35Advocacy organizations are even more predominant  in global LGBTQ funding than they are in domestic LGBTQ funding, capturing three-quarters of grant dollars. Of the sub-types of LGBTQ advocacy organizations, international advocacy organizations received the largest share: about $7 million, or about 40 percent of all international dollars awarded to LGBTQ organizations. Note that this category includes organizations with a global mission, such as  IGLHRC, as well as organizations such as African Men for Sexual Health and Rights, whose scope includes several countries in a particular region of the world. The second largest share of dollars ($5.5 million) went to national  advocacy organizations, which focus on advocating for  LGBTQ communities in a specific country. Smaller shares went to advocacy organizations working at the local level (within a specific city, province, or sub-region of a country) and to organizations whose primary focus is litigation,About $1.9 million of global LGBTQ funding was awarded  to service providers, more than half of which went to  organizations specifically addressing HIV/AIDS. Another  $1.1 million went to grassroots LGBTQ community groups, including faith-based groups, groups that  organize local pride marches, and groups that come  together to build community, support one another,  and advocate for themselves.It should be noted that LGBTQ organizations often  have multi-pronged missions and use multiple strategies,  making any classification like this one difficult. This is  particularly true for organizations outside the U.S., especially in those countries where there are few formalized LGBTQ organizations. For example, it is common for one organiza-tion to provide HIV/AIDS services for gay and transgender communities and also to serve as the primary voice and advocate for LGBTQ issues in its home country. We have sought to categorize these organizations as best as possible, based on the primary focus of their mission and programs.

More  than half of these grant dollars were for organizations  working at the international level, with most of the  remainder going to organizations working at the national level in specific countries. Among non-LGBTQ organizations internationally,  the second-largest share of grant dollars went to  grassroots groups, split about evenly between faith  communities and networks of businesses and professionals.

This represents an increase from $5.5 million in 2012. In the last few years, community  foundations have steadily accounted for five percent of all LGBTQ funding.  Note: This section includes funding awarded by community foundations from their discretionary funds as well  as from their donor-advised funds, which are often driven by recommendations from the donor who originally  established the fund.

Instead, community foundations invested heavily in building communities, families  and visibility as well as health and well-being issues. Since community foundations are place-based funders, some of this  difference may be attributed to the fact that most of the large civil rights advocacy organizations are national. In contrast, direct service providers working on health and building community tend to be locally focused.

In 2013,  donor advised funds awarded $1 million to LGBTQ issues, accounting for 18 percent of community foundation  funding for LGBTQ issues. This represented a decrease in grantmaking of approximately $400,000. For the most  part, donor advised funds mirrored the rest of community foundation funding in terms of issues addressed and  geographical focus.  GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS OF  COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONSHONOR ROLL: The Cleveland FoundationIn 2013, the Cleveland Foundation awarded a $250,000 grant to the Cleveland Special Events Corporation to sponsor  the 2014 Gay Games. It marked the first time the Gay Games ever secured a presenting sponsor. It also nearly  doubled the investment the Cleveland Foundation had made in LGBTQ issues to date. * Includes both “international” and “outside the U.S.” funding.2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations40CORPORATE GRANTMAKING FOR LGBTQ ISSUESIn 2013, corporate foundation support reached a record high of $9.7 million (or $9.4 million after dollars awarded for  re-granting are excluded). Corporate funding increased nearly 9 percent from $8.9 million in 2012, and continued  to account for seven percent of all LGBTQ grantmaking.  NOTE: There are many corporations giving to the LGBTQ community without an official foundation or philanthropic  office and as such there are companies we are not yet able to track. Currently, our corporate data only includes corporate foundation grantmaking and employee matching gift programs. It does not include in-kind gifts. However, we want to acknowledge that whether money comes from an official philanthropic arm, a marketing budget, or an in-kind donation, corporate support for LGBTQ issues can have a significant impact on LGBTQ communities worldwide. Moreover, we are currently working to improve our data collection as it relates to corporate funders and look forward to sharing the results in future reports.Top 10 Corporate Funders1  Wells Fargo FoundationSan Francisco, CA   $3,650,368 2  M.A.C.

As in previous years, private  foundations represent the largest slice of LGBTQ funding, with their grantmaking constituting approximately 54 percent of LGBTQ funding in 2013.

Almost 40 percent of this came from  the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund, which granted over a half a million dollars for the promotion of immigration  reform issues and LGBTQ equality. This was the same year that United States v. Windsor historically struck down  Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, allowing U.S. citizens to sponsor an immigrant spouse of the same sex for  the first time. To learn more about funding for LGBTQ immigration issues, check out the Funders for LGBTQ Issues’  report “Pathways Forward: Foundation Funding for LGBTQ Immigration Issues” at www.lgbtfunders.org/resources/PathwaysForward.cfm.The distribution of funding by private foundations very closely matches  that of all LGBTQ grantmaking — which is not surprising since private foundation giving adds up to over  half of all LGBTQ funding.

LGBTQ grantmaking by public funders increased more than 10 percent from $30 million in 2012.As in previous years, LGBTQ funding from public funders was fairly evenly split between funders rooted in the LGBTQ community and other funders. LGBTQ public funders awarded $16.3 million, and other public funders awarded slightly more than $17 million.Nearly $15 million was awarded to public funders in 2013 for the purposes of re-granting to LGBTQ communities.2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 47$ $Violence, Homophobia, and Transphobia  $1,081,152 (3%)Economic Issues  $473,563 (2%) Breakdown of Issues Addressed  by Public Funders2013 Public Fund Grant DollarsPercentage of Public Fund GrantmakingPercentage of all LGBTQ GrantmakingCivil Rights and Human Rights $15,036,710 46% 42%Strengthening Communities, Families, and Visibility $4,926,690 15% 23%Health and Well-being $6,662,462 21% 19%Education and Safe Schools $3,342,057 10% 7%Economic Issues $473,563 2% 3%Violence, Homophobia, and Transphobia $1,081,152 3% 2%Other Issues $1,070,584 3% 4%TOTAL $32,593,218    ISSUES ADDRESSED BY PUBLIC FUNDERSNearly half of the funding from public funds went to civil rights or human rights work, mirroring the overall picture of LGBTQ funding.

All types of foundations were surveyed — private, public, community and corporate — as well as nonprofit organizations with grantmaking programs. Information was obtained predominantly through self-reporting by grantmakers, as well as a review of 990s and annual reports.  This report includes all information received as of December 15, 2014.Our overarching research goal was to ensure that the data we collected focused specifically on LGBTQ issues and  organizations. Therefore, the data does not include grants to organizations or projects that are generally inclusive of LGBTQ people unless they explicitly address an LGBTQ issue or population. For example, a women’s organization given a grant to develop a sex education curriculum for girls, open and welcoming to all girls, including LBTQ girls, would not have been included in the data. If that same organization was funded to provide sex education specifically to LBTQ girls,  it would have been included.We have included all re-granting dollars in charts that rank individual grantmakers and the appendix to accurately show the overall level of LGBTQ funding provided by each grantmaker, regardless of whether those dollars are provided in the form of direct grants or through an intermediary that then re- grants those dollars to other organizations and individuals. As a result, the charts that rank grantmakers and the appendix ”double-count” re-granting when aggregated. However, for all other tabulations and charts, we have not included dollars awarded for the purpose of re-granting, so as to avoid double counting. This year, we changed the way we track populations. In the past, grants were attributed to a maximum of two population focuses. This year, every grant was coded for specific populations served based on sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity/race, age group, and other special population associations. Thus a grant for young incarcerated trans women of color could be attributed to four different populations as opposed to our old system where this grant would only be attributed to two populations.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSOur heartfelt appreciation goes out to all the people who made this report possible, particularly to our members and other foundations who took the time to provide us with data on their grantmaking for LGBTQ communities. A very  special thank you to Nancy Cunningham, who early on offered invaluable advice based on her many years of experience tracking LGBTQ grantmaking, and to Patrick Yacco, who assisted in researching and coding the 2013 LGBTQ grants. For the first time, we were pleased to partner with CenterLink to ask LGBTQ community centers to participate in submitting information about their funding sources. Many thanks to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center (New York, NY); Pride Center of the Capital Region (Albany, NY); Spectrum LGBT Center (San Rafael, CA); and Youth Pride, Inc (Providence, RI) for participating in our data collection efforts and providing us with information on your vital  programs. Finally, we’re extremely grateful to Cindy Rizzo and Matty Hart for helping to edit the final report in addition  to all they do on a regular basis as board members.2013 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 61Cindy Rizzo, ChairVice President, Impact & Learning, Arcus FoundationRebecca Fox, Vice ChairProgram Officer, Wellspring AdvisorsMitchell Singer, TreasurerDirector, Rockefeller Philanthropy AdvisorsPatricia St. Onge, SecretaryPartner, Seven Generations Consulting and CoachingRohit BurmanExecutive Director, Global Philanthropy and Corporate  Citizenship of the Estée Lauder CompaniesMaria CadenasPhilanthropy Advisor, Driscoll’sMatthew “Matty” HartPresident of the Board of Directors, Calamus Foundation, DESurina KhanChief Executive Officer, Women’s Foundation of CaliforniaAndrew LaneExecutive Director, Johnson Family FoundationKristine StalloneVice President for Finance and Administration,  American Jewish World ServiceNathaniel “Toby” ThompkinsVice President, Tides 21st CenturyBeatriz “Bia” VieiraPhilanthropic ConsultantBoard of DirectorsBen Francisco Maulbeck PresidentLyle Matthew Kan Director of Communications and EducationMarvin Webb Director of Operations and Member ServicesKristina Wertz Director of EngagementNaa Hammond Research and Communications AssociateJustin Brown LGBT Health Funding Summit InternStaffAuthors:  Lyle Matthew Kan and Ben Francisco MaulbeckCreative Director: Lyle Matthew KanEditors: Naa Hammond and Marvin WebbGraphic Designer: Tammy Collins, Evolve Visual DesignLead Researcher: Naa HammondResearchers:  Lyle Matthew Kan, Ben Francisco Maulbeck,  and Patrick YaccoReport CreditsMISSIONFunders for LGBTQ Issues works to mobilize the philanthropic resources that enhance the well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities, promote equity and advance racial, economic and gender justice.© DECEMBER 2014, FUNDERS FOR LGBTQ ISSUESPermission is granted to reproduce this document in part or in its entirety, provided that Funders for LGBTQ Issues is cited  as the source for all reproduced material.Funders for LGBTQ Issues104 West 29th Street, 4th Floor  |  New York, NY 10001  |  Telephone: 212 . 475 . 2930  |  Fax: 212 . 475 . 2532 www.lgbtfunders.org  |  Twitter: @lgbtfunders  |  Facebook: www.facebook.com/LGBTQFunders",
