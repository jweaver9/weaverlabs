Geolog-ical sciences professor Kerry Cook said winds from Tropical Storm Lee, which blew through Louisiana, brought smoke from the Bastrop fires as they drifted to the south-west. As of press time, firefighters have contained 30 percent of the Bastrop blaze that began Sunday and burned approximately 43,000 acres and 785 homes and caused two fatalities.Tropical storm winds did not bring smoke from fires burning to the west of Austin in the Lake Travis area, such as the Steiner P1THE DAILY TEXANServing the University of Texas at Austin community since 1900>> Breaking news, blogs and more: www.dailytexanonline.com @thedailytexan facebook.com/dailytexan  SPORTS  PAGE  9Thursday, September 8, 2011Webster returnsSophomore is back on court after sitting out last season with torn ACL NEWS  PAGE  5Clicker conflictsDo classroom clicker systems bring more harm than help?The UT chapter of building tomorrow raises awareness about sub-Saharan Africa @bit.ly/dt_video  Despite dissent from some citi-zens, city officials are finding ceme-tery conditions up to par. Sharon Blythe, director of Rescue Austin Memorial Parks, is leading a group of residents in challenging city council members to reconsider man-agement of cemeteries. Blythe said the group, nicknamed RAMP, was formed in 1991 when citizens be-came concerned over whether cem-etery property would be sold to de-velopers. She said group members be-lieve property upkeep is substan-dard and are worried about over-all maintenance of the five Austin memorial parks.“It’s becoming a public safety haz-ard now,” Blythe said. “The trees are dying. The headstones are leaning and fall over quite frequently. There was even a lady who broke her leg out there a couple years ago.”Blythe said RAMP members are filing complaints and requesting sys-tematic maintenance of the cemeter-ies. She hopes council members will consider ending the current man-agement contract with the Intercare Corporation, which has managed the Austin city cemeteries since 1990.Intercare Corporation direc-tor Gene Bagwell said his organiza-tion has followed all procedures laid out in its contract in terms of main-tenance, burials and expenses. Bag- UT hosted members of men-toring programs, cultural aware-ness groups and other volunteer organizations Wednesday to get students involved in community service both on and off campus.The Volunteer Fair, sponsored by UT’s Volunteer and Service Learning Center, hosted nonprof-it and government organizations looking to recruit students to vol-unteer. Kimberly Edwards, the cen-ter’s community engagement co-ordinator, said the fair is designed to make a wide range of volun-teer opportunities more accessi-ble to students. Getting involved in community service helps stu-dents broaden their perspectives and become better-rounded indi-viduals, she said.“I feel it’s very important to give of yourself and to give through service,” Edwards said. “If you give back to someone, that per-son can also be motivated to help others.”She said the center aims to make people at the University more aware of the number of vol-unteering opportunities available around Austin.“Austin is certainly a city where people are aware and active in giving back,” Edwards said. “The number of students at the Uni-versity of Texas is such a huge re-source for thousands of nonprof-its that we have here.”Members of Big Brothers Big Sisters, a nonprofit men-toring program for underpriv-ileged children, attended the fair to recruit volunteers from all majors and fields.

According to the study, the focus is to understand how com-panies are using technology to train people to do jobs without di-rect social interaction.  “The way people learn [to do a job] is to be with people who have that job already,” Bailey said. “One of the things we suspect is that this new mode of learning allows a cer-tain amount of leeway that one wouldn’t see in traditional occupa-tional socialization.”The grant will be split between UT, the University of California, Irvine and Northwestern Univer-sity to carry out similar research projects around the world.  The money will pay for travel between the United States, Bra-zil, Poland, Mexi-co and India, and it will also cover costs including of-fice space and pay for graduate stu-dent hired to as-sist with research, Bailey said.“Any time you get a grant, it’s a great day,” Bailey said. “It’s an opportunity for us to do exciting research.”Bailey will collect data on Brazi l ian bankers,  she said.

According to the contract, Intercare’s upkeep responsibil-ities do not include “the main-tenance, repair or replace-ment of any memorial or curb-ing placed or erected upon any grave or space.”Bagwell said private fami-lies are responsible for repair of headstones at their own expense and Intercare addresses graves-ite concerns brought forth by the family or responsible party.“If a family comes back and addresses the issue of a fallen headstone, it’s fixed,” Bagwell said. “The reality is, some fami-lies move away and may not be aware of the condition it’s in.”Bagwell said settling of burial plots occurs naturally, especial-ly with burials conducted prior to the use of concrete casket lin-ers. Occasionally headstones will crack or appear unlevel because of ground settling, he said.Bagwell also said his corpo-ration has spent more than usu-al on ground watering since the drought began.Gilbert Hernandez, parks and recreation contract manag-er, said the city conducts semi-monthly inspections of all five cemeteries and has not found anything out of the ordinary in terms of upkeep. Hernandez said the most re-cent audit of Intercare’s expens-es came back “clean,” but Blythe said RAMP members are also concerned with the actual use of cemetery funding.“We look for issues that we think might be of concern,” Her-nandez said. “We track any is-sue that needs to be taken care of and have a third party audi-tor go out and look at his [Bag-well’s] books.”Contreras, a member of the or-ganization, said she is seeking students who are committed to making a difference in the lives of underserved children. “We have a lot of UT students who volunteer with us,” Contre-ras said. “It’s really great to serve as a role model in a child’s life and show them that they can get an education and achieve great things too.”Contreras said she encourag-es UT students to get involved in community service because vol-unteering helped her achieve a more enriching college experi-ence.“You get such a positive feel-ing from giving back, and you make a lot of great friendships,” she said. “I think it helps you de-velop yourself both professional-ly and personally.”Melanie Morgan, Mexic-Arte Museum spokeswoman, said she is seeking volunteers for an up-coming art festival the museum is hosting in October.“Cultural organizations are important for remembering who you are,” Morgan said. “It often seems like the campus is cut off from the rest of the Austin com-munity, and we think it’s impor-tant to get students on campus involved in a wider range of or-ganizations.”Aimee Ford, plan II and pre-med freshman, said she attend-ed the fair to find new commu-nity service opportunities as she transitions from high school to college life.“I feel like college is about much more than just classes and education,” Ford said. “I definite-ly feel like a lot of people at UT have that awareness and spirit of giving back.”Technology has made it possible for anybody to get training to be-come a banker where it may not have been possible before, Bai-ley said. With more local banks around now, she said residents don’t have to travel to cities to cash their checks and spend money. “Because people [were] spend-ing their money in the city where their bank [was], they weren’t spending as much in the towns where they live,” Bailey said. “One positive outcome for the community is a financial resur-gence because of the correspon-dent model,” Bailey said.Andrew Dillon, Dean of the School of Information, said the NSF grant recognizes the impor-tance of information science in relation to the workplace. “The right technology fos-ters connections between groups that allows for rapid organiza-tion and exchange of ideas with-out concern for distance,” Dillon said. “But with this comes un-foreseen problems and challeng-es that will require analysis at the human and social levels to best exploit the technical power. We are becoming a vast socio-tech-nical system that challenges ex-isting structures.”Communications studies grad-uate student Stephanie Dailey will be working with Bailey and will be traveling to Poland and India, she said.“I’m going to be helping inter-view participants of the study,” Dailey said. “I’m really excited about collecting research in dif-ferent countries. I haven’t had the opportunity to do that before.”Ranch fire that damaged and de-stroyed more than 50 homes. Tra-vis County Fire Chief Jim Linardos said crews have contained 75 per-cent of the Steiner Ranch fire as of Wednesday and expect to have it under full control by Thursday.“As I look out my window, I can see smoke over the city,” Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell said. “We’re getting a lot of calls concerning the issue, but it is only a result of the winds dying down, and we have no fires in the city.” Cook said smoke appearing Wednesday morning could also be associated with a temperature inver-sion, in which cooler temperatures do not allow the smoke to rise.“This is just like when pollution is trapped above the city in L.A.,” Cook said. “The smoke doesn’t reach up into the atmosphere, and the winds are in the direction to bring that downtown.”Theresa Spalding, Universi-ty Health Services associate direc-tor, said drifting smoke is a great-er concern to people living in plac-es directly impacted by the recent wildfires because the possibility of soot and ash inhalation is greater in these areas. Spalding said linger-ing smoke in Austin may cause re-spiratory irritation or minor head-aches, but symptoms will not ap-pear as strongly as they would in residents of directly affected areas. Austin residents with asthma may feel stronger symptoms and should limit outdoor activity if necessary, she said.“Some people are asking about masks,” Spalding said. “We have gotten calls about that. The masks you can get [at stores] are more about trying to keep large particles out of your passageways. We aren’t recommending masks to people just walking around campus.”Program aims to develop women’s interest in politics T h e  C e n t e r  f o r  Wo m -en’s and Gender Studies re-ceived a $100,200 grant, which will initiate a program for w o m e n ’ s  e m p o w e r m e n t , encouraging more active par-ticipation in politics. T h e  E m b r e y  F a m i l y Foundation gave the grant and will start a nationwide program called the National E d u c a t i o n  f o r  Wo m e n ’ s Leadership summer pro-gram at UT for the first time, according to a press release. The six-day program will bring together undergraduate women from across the state in order to learn more about policymaking. “We want a diverse group with many interests and non-tradit ional  majors ,”  said program coordinator Nan-cy Ewert. “The purpose is [to] get more women inter-ested in politics, so this will benefit anyone interested in policymaking.”A c c o r d i n g  t o  t h e p r o g r a m ’ s  c u r r i c u l u m , a c t i v i t i e s  w i l l  i n c l u d e speaking with successful wom-en in a variety of roles in the public sphere, learning about women’s political participa-tion, exploring ideas about leadership and politics and participating in hands-on skill-building exercises. The Embrey grant has made this program possible by covering costs such as housing, food, program ma-terials and staffing. Applications to attend this program will open in Novem-ber 2011, with the deadline of March 2012. For the 2012 ses-sion, the program will initial-ly accept only 20 students, fol-lowed by 30 students for the 2013 session.— Sylvia ButandaNEWS BRIEFLYBecause of a reporting error, Tuesday’s Page 1 news story about wildfires should have said the church in the story was called Bastrop Community Outreach Church.CORRECTIONTexan AdDeadlinesMonday .............Wednesday, 12 p.m.Tuesday.................Thursday, 12 p.m.Wednesday................Friday, 12 p.m.Thursday.................Monday, 12 p.m.Friday......................Tuesday, 12 p.m.Classified Word Ads       11 a.m. (Last Business Day Prior to Publication)THE DAILY TEXANThe Daily Texan Mail Subscription RatesOne Semester (Fall or Spring)  $60.00Two Semesters (Fall and Spring) 120.00Summer Session 40.00One Year (Fall, Spring and Summer) 150.00To charge by VISA or MasterCard, call 471-5083.

Jon Huntsman sided with Perry when he turned to Romney and said, “47th just isn’t going to cut it, my friend,” a refer-ence to the rank Massachusetts had among the 50 states in creating jobs during Romney’s term.Businessman Herman Cain, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bach-mann, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, for-mer House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania shared the stage for the debate hosted by MSNBC and Politico.Bachmann said she would pro-vide the “strong, bold leader in the presidency who will lead that effort. “None of us should ever think that the repeal bill will just come to our desk,” she said in a pledge that drew applause from the audience.Gingrich resisted an effort to draw him into conflict with other Repub-licans on stage. “I’m frankly not in-terested in your efforts to get Re-publicans fighting each other,” he said, sparking an even louder round of applause. He said all Republicans should “defeat efforts by the news media” to spark an internal struggle when the real objective is to defeat Obama in 2012.But moments later, Cain said that after trying to defeat Democratic ef-forts to create national health care, “I’m running against Romneycare,” the legislation that passed requiring residents of Massachusetts to pur-chase coverage.TUNOSHNA, Russia — A pri-vate jet carrying a Russian pro-fessional hockey team to its first game of the season crashed short-ly after takeoff Wednesday, kill-ing 43 people — including Euro-pean and former NHL players — in one of the worst aviation disas-ters in sports history. Two people survived the accident.The crash also was the lat-est tragedy to befall the sport of hockey — following the sudden, offseason deaths of three of the NHL’s tough-guy enforcers that has shocked fans.The chartered Yak-42 jet was carrying the team — Lokomotiv Yaroslavl — to Minsk, the capi-tal of Belarus, where it was to play Thursday in its opening game of the Kontinental Hockey League season. Of the 45 people on board, 36 were players, coaches and team officials; eight were crew.The plane apparently struggled to gain altitude and then hit a sig-nal tower before breaking apart along the Volga River near Yaro-slavl, 150 miles northeast of Mos-cow. One of the blue-and-white plane’s charred engines poked through the surface of the shal-low water.“This is the darkest day in the history of our sport,” said Rene Fasel, president of the Internation-al Ice Hockey Federation. “This is not only a Russian tragedy — the Lokomotiv roster included players and coaches from 10 nations.”One player — identified as Rus-sian Alexander Galimov — and one unidentified crew member were hospitalized in “very grave” condition, said Alexander Degya-tryov, chief doctor at Yaroslavl’s Solovyov Hospital.Among the dead were Loko-motiv coach and NHL veter-an Brad McCrimmon, a Cana-dian; assistant coach Alexander Karpovtsev, one of the first Rus-sians to have his name etched on the Stanley Cup as a member of the New York Rangers; and Pavol Demitra, who played for the St. Louis Blues and the Vancouver Canucks and was the Slovakian national team captain.Jae C.

Rick Perry in a press release Tuesday after taking an aerial tour of wildfire damage in Steiner Ranch.“We were outvoted — what can I say? Obvi-ously this money is needed for natural disasters like the ones we have right now. ... We do have a rainy day fund, and I would hope that the gov-ernor goes into the rainy day fund. But we have to also be responsible here locally, and cutting the Forest Service budget significantly was not being responsible.”— State Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, a retired firefighter, on the re-duced funding for the Texas Forest Service included in the recently passed state budget, which Gallegos voted against.“Damage to this community is reflective of all Texas.”—Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples on the fires ravaging Bastrop, according to The Daily Texan.“All of the fires are not in the city limits of Aus-tin. If the fires were in the city limits of Austin, that would have been a whole different thing, and I would have made my way back as fast as I could have.”—Austin Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr in a phone interview with the Aus-tin American-Statesman on Tuesday on her decision to stay in Colorado for a golfing trip rather than return to Austin.“[The fire] is not in the city of Austin. But we don’t work that way. We think of this area as a region, and we’re all in this together.”— Mayor Lee Leffingwell on the fires, according to The Daily Texan.“It’s a 100-year event, with fires of this magni-tude. It would be better if the chief was here to at least provide guidance to the citizens.”— Bob Nicks, president of the Austin Firefighters Association, on the fires and Kerr’s decision to stay in Colorado, according to the Statesman.Perry on climate change“I do believe the issue of global warming has been politicized. I think there are a substan-tial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling in to their projects.”— Perry in Bedford, New Hampshire, last month, according to CBS News.“The complexities of the global atmosphere have often eluded the most sophisticated scientists.”— Perry in his book, “Fed Up,” on the causes of global climate change.“People who discount the science of climate change don’t do it because they’ve read the sci-ence. The science of climate change is a proxy for views on the role of government.”— Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M Uni-versity, according to National Public Radio.by Katherine taylorDaily Texan Guest ColumnistThere are few events I remember clearly from my adolescence. Aside from my afro hair, awkward physical changes and the stu-pid uniform I had to wear to school, there are not many other details I can recall from that time in my life.But I remember Sept. 11, 2001. I was in the sixth grade. The normal morning I had wo-ken up to lasted until my third period choir class. The strange whisperings about plane crashes that I had heard all morning finally started to make sense as we turned on the TV and finally saw what was going on.And the same image kept flashing on the screen — I’m sure you remember the one I’m talking about because every single news out-let showed it. The one of the plane crashing directly into the tower, people screaming, debris flying everywhere and a voice from off camera yelling some variation of “I think it’s coming down! The tower, the tower ... is falling!” This sequence was repeated for the rest of the week. In response to Alan Jack-son’s popular query of the time, I knew ex-actly where I was “when the world stopped turning,” and I first grasped the effects of terrorism.We are still feeling those effects today. Though Osama bin Laden is dead, the threat of terrorism remains. At least that is the jus-tification given for the increasingly disturb-ing measures we have adopted since. When you go to an airport and face the handsy TSA agents, shoe robbers and long lines, remem-ber 9/11. When you visit Washington D.C. and realize that you can no longer dip your toes into the reflecting pool between the Lin-coln Memorial and the World War II Memo-rial because of fences, remember 9/11. When you encounter rampant Islamophobia and fear of everything Middle Eastern, remember 9/11. When you hear crazy liberals (like my-self ) lecturing you about the evils of Guan-tanamo Bay, remember 9/11.This country has been fighting a war against an enemy that we have yet to defeat for al-most half of my life. It’s unclear whether we will ever have peace again. This war is waged against an ideology whose hold might never be fully squelched no matter how much fire-power we use. For better or worse, American destiny is inextricably tied with the complex workings of nations far away from us both in distance and in belief systems.Sunday marks the 10th anniversary of this defining national tragedy. For those who lost friends or families in the attacks, the effects are felt on a much more personal level. This fact didn’t sink in for me until I made my first friend who lost her dad in the attacks. I used to judge anyone who supported George W. Bush’s War on Terrorism, but it’s not that simple. Our safety, our families, our freedom, our everything American that we treasure most was threatened on that fateful day. The need for retaliation was felt nationwide.But 10 years later, are we any safer? Is any-one sleeping any sounder at night? Have we even helped the constantly tense political situation in the Middle East? Does anyone even understand why we went to Iraq in the first place?I realize the answers to all these questions are highly contentious. But after 10 years of war, I would hope the answers would be more definitive. Yet since then, we’ve joined anoth-er offensive campaign in Libya, and though our presence in the Middle East has changed, our enemy hasn’t. Our war against the amor-phous practitioners of terrorism remains.Are we stubbornly trying to bring peace through war to the Middle East — the equiv-alent of attempting to force a square peg of Western ideals into the round hole of Iraq? Or were we forced into a corner by the des-perate acts of others into the only available course of action?Whichever side you fall on is irrelevant. The fact that these questions still exist shows the extent to which we are still grappling with the attacks. Perhaps that’s what the terrorists wanted all along: for us to be thinking about them and giving them attention a decade later rather than saving all that energy and money to help our failing economy. Regardless, this Sunday, I will still remem-ber the events of Sept. 11.Taylor is a Plan II and rhetoric and writing senior. 9/11: Grappling with the attacks 10 years laterEmail your Firing Lines to firingline@dailytexanonline.com.

Students pick days they want to attend class, and on days they do not attend, they hand their devices to others in the group, she said.“There are a number of people I have seen who kind of work in groups for attendance reasons with the clicker,” Eckert said. Professors have recognized the problem and now instruct teaching assistants to keep an extra eye out for students with more than one clicker, musicology professor An-drew Dell’Antonio said.“While I haven’t personal-ly caught anyone cheating, I do know some colleagues who have,” Dell’Antonio said. “I tell my classes that if we do find someone, we will confiscate both clickers and penal-ize both students.”The clickers are not usually used for exams because professors re-alize it is not a secure way of sub-mitting answers, Dell’Antonio said. They are instead used for questions of opinion that can neither be right nor wrong, he said. Students are not tempted to cheat in these situations because they are not afraid of their grades being affected by a wrong answer, Dell’Antonio said.“Once a student picks an answer, they tend to be more invested in de-fending its merits,” he said.The risks of the clicker are worth it to the professors because it is an instantaneous system for making sure students understand the mate-rial, Dell’Antonio said. “I’ve had good experiences with the clicker,” he said. “We can spend more time on an issue because I know if a large percent of the class doesn’t get it.” Senior biology lecturer Sata Sathasivan said clicker quizzes play an important role in his large intro-ductory biology class. He said cell phones could be used as the click-er, and people would be less inclined to give their phones to their friend to cheat. It would also eliminate the cost of buying another school sup-ply, Sathasivan said. “All we need to do at UT is dou-ble the bandwidth on campus to en-sure students get reception in every classroom,” he added.Clicker quizzes or questions are always simple with no right or wrong answers, so there is no rea-son for students to cheat, chemistry junior Ruhin Vahora said.— Additional reporting by Shane MillerA women’s group marked the pending 10-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks by holding its 520th weekly vigil in front of the State Capitol on Wednesday.Fourteen women and one man dressed in black, the color of mourning, held placards and handed out flyers at the southern gate of the Capitol supporting the peace movement.Women in Black, an informal group of local protesters opposing the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghani-stan, claims to have held the hour-long weekly protest since the Twin Towers fell in New York 10 years ago on Sunday. The original Women in Black group started in Jerusalem in 1988 as a peace movement between Palestinian and Israeli women and gained increased recognition in the U.S. following the Sept. 11 attacks, according to the protesters.Pam Murfin, a spokeswoman for the group, said the anniversary pro-vided a public forum to advocate an end to U.S. military operations in the Middle East.“Sept. 11 was a terrible event, with a terrible reaction. Rather than negotiating and trying to lessen the violence, our government leapt in and escalated it. It has caused a lot of death and maiming,” Murf-in said. “War is not the answer, and [students] can be helpful if they get involved in some way, even if it’s just talking to people about how to solve conflict nonviolently.”Moneta Prince, an Austin resi-dent who joined the group follow-ing the U.S. led invasion of Iraq, said community attitudes to the wars have changed in the eight years she has supported the cause.“People are a little more wise to what the [wars] are about. They’re withdrawing their support, and I think most people would like to pull out,” Prince said. English senior Evelyn Gibson said she expected the mood to be som-bre on Sunday but agrees that sup-port for the wars among the student body has seen a steady decline.“We really cared in 2008 with the election of Obama, but nothing has changed. Politics is the same,” Gibson said. “I don’t think a lot of us want to be there anymore. We wasted all this money, and we haven’t really got any-where, especially in Afghanistan. We killed Osama Bin Laden, but there’s still no end in sight.”5 UNIVTexas Exes Student Chapter invites you to theORANGE & WHITEWELCOMESeptember 8th � 4 - 6 PMEtter-Harbin Alumni Center(across the street from DKR stadium)During the event you can pick up your membership kit which includes a burnt orange TESC shirt and more!WIN GREAT PRIZES � FREE FOODMeet our discount program partners who will showcase their exclusive TESC offers through exciting giveaways and delicious samples!

The Cou-gars air the ball out and have done so for years. With quarterbacks such as Marc Wilson, Jim McMahon, Steve Young, John Beck and Max Hall, it is no surprise that BYU has earned a reputation as one of the top quarterback factories in the country. Sophomore Jake Heaps is the Cougars’ latest product. Heaps was a top quarterback in the 2010 class, and he brings a lot to the table in terms of poise and throwing accuracy. The same was said of the Longhorns’ Garrett Gilbert in 2009. So just what kind of quarterback battle will be in store for this week-end? Let’s take a look at the stats.To start, both Gilbert and Heaps led their high schools to multiple state championships. Heaps, who hails from Washington, passed for 9,196 yards and 114 touchdowns from 2007-09 while at Skyline High School. Gilbert holds the Texas high school record for passing yards with 12,540, which he set in three years as a starter at nearby Lake Travis High School from 2006-08. Both quarterbacks were Parade All-Americans. Heaps came out of a pro-style offense in high school, whereas Gil-bert was accustomed to the spread. And yet, both quarter-backs were sent into opposite situations than they be-came accustomed to in high school: BYU runs the power spread, whereas Texas ran (or tried to) a more pro-style rushing attack in 2010.Heaps was thrown into the fire early last season as a true freshman, replacing an injured Riley Nelson against Flor-ida State in 2010. THE STAT GUYQuarterbacks share similar statistics, storiesBy Hank SouthDaily Texan StaffUT, A&M fans both agonize over network’s role in changeBrown, Horns not taking BYU lightly Texas will face stiffer com-petition this weekend when it squares off against BYU, es-pecially at the line of scrim-mage. The Longhorns are 0-2 all-time against the Cougars with BYU beating Texas 22-17 in 1987 and 47-6 in 1988. A lot has changed since then, of course, but Texas will go up against a BYU offensive line whose starters stand at an average 6 feet 5 inches, 307 pounds. The Longhorns’ defensive line? More than 30 pounds lighter — they’re an average 6 feet 5 inches, 276 pounds.“This’ ll be a street fight,” head coach Mack Brown said. “The strength of this team is on both lines of scrimmage. Those guys are physical.”Shipley got head start on Longhorns practice fieldJaxon Shipley may have hit the practice field before anyone on the team.He just wasn’t practicing when he first got there.The comparisons to his old-er brother and current Cincinna-ti Bengals wide receiver, Jordan, have been endless and with good reason. But while Jordan was hon-ing his skills on the practice field, Jaxon was occupied with other matters. Jaxon, along with his sis-ters, turned the workout area into a playground of sorts as he con-stantly rolled down a hill near the practice field. We already know Texas A&M, soon to be the newest member of the Southeastern Conference, doesn’t like the Longhorn Network.Judging by some recent com-ments on our website, it looks like Texas fans are getting fed up as well: “This has really gone too far!! Our family has been a ‘Horn’s back-er for years ... this network thing is one step too many in UT’s arro-gance, especially after last year.” — comment from DCE. “Goodwill to the Longhorns has been lost, fan for 50 years and this is the thanks I get! Good, bad, ugly, I’ve been behind them ... and now that maroon team (can’t say the name) our longest rivalry is gone ... thanks LONGHORN NETWORK, UT, MACK BROWN, AND ESPN.” — comment from ‘lnghrntchr” “Got to be one of the most un-abashed examples of mismanage-ment and financial greed we’ve seen in a while. Too bad The Universi-ty stands by and allows it.” — com-ment from Prospector. While none of these folks chose to reveal their real names (give it up, lnghrntchr) they had no problem expressing their sudden disgust for the network that is the driving force By Trey ScottDaily Texan ColumnistMary Kang | Daily Texan Staff Texas head coach Mack Brown glances at the scoreboard during the Longhorns’ 34-9 win over Rice on Saturday. Texas faces a tougher opponent this week as Brigham Young visits Austin in a non-conference game. Thomas Allison | Daily Texan Staff Sophomore outside hitter Bailey Webster is fully recovered from a torn ACL in her right knee that forced her to miss the 2010 season. Webster healthy, ready to contribute Last season did not turn out like Bailey Webster had expected.During preseason practice last year, Webster tore her ACL and had surgery on her right knee in August 2010. Although she was ranked as the No. 1 recruit going into her freshman year, she re-ceived a medical redshirt for her sophomore season.After a tough year of rehab, she is back and ready to help the Longhorns.“It started with baby steps at first, just little things, just mov-ing my leg again,” Webster said. “Basically, I had to relearn how to walk all over again.”She said gaining back mus-cle was extremely difficult. She worked on that aspect of her re-covery for months and said it was a process that didn’t end be-fore preseason, yet she still does rehab when she can.But, her teammates remained by her side during the entire process and supported her constantly.“Every time they would come over to get water, they would cheer me on in whatever exer-cise I was doing,” Webster said. “Some of my teammates would come over to my house and just hang out with me to make sure I was still included in team activities.”While injured, she contin-ued strengthening her upper body.

That happened, it didn’t surprise me, but we are committed to the SEC. It’s the strongest conference in the country and only going to get stronger.”Long commented hours after the SEC’s announcement that it will accept Tex-as A&M as the league’s 13th member, if the school can exit the Big 12 without any pending legal issues.Long said the SEC is prepared to move forward with 13 teams should Texas A&M join the conference. He also said discus-sions over a 14th team had not begun.“I would say that most people think 14 is the logical step,” he said. “I would say the SEC is prepared to move forward with 13. It would be fair for me to say there are schools interested in becoming that 14th mem-ber, and again, we’re not seeking them out, they’re seeking us out. Again, that will play out in the days, weeks and months ahead.”Long said he didn’t know how long the “ripple effect” of realignment might go on.“If we stay at 12, not much will change,” he said. — The Associated PressSPORTS BRIEFLYVOLLEYBALL8 SPTSvisit us at WWW.UTEXAS.EDU/TSMThe Daily Texan • TSTV • KVRX • Texas Travesty • Cactus YearbookCONTACT USCarter GossBroadcast Manager &SponsorshipsP 512.475.6721E cartergoss@mail.utexas.eduFOR MORE INFORMATIONLook for The Daily Texan tentat the corner of MLK & BrazosTEXASSTUDENTMEDIACome and enjoy a good ‘ol time!Enjoy free stuff from our sponsors & watch the game on a big screen tv under the tent!!Presented by Tailgate Daysare every homegame!September 3RiceSeptember 10BYUOctober 15Oklahoma StateOctober 29KansasNovember 5Texas TechNovember 19Kansas State        SAN JACDK Royal - Texas Memorial StadiumDouble Coverage &A Special Thanks  to8 Thursday, September 8, 2011SPORTScoaches and trainers, helped her during the entire process and motivated her.“Everybody helped and stayed positive,” Webster said. “With in-juries like that, you can get down very easily. It was an all-around ef-fort, and everyone helped.”Now, she wears a brace and does exercises before practices to warm up her knee. She said by hesitating and being cautious, you are more likely to injure yourself.“I just go out and play like ev-erybody else,” Webster said. “I just have to go and play and risk it, and whatever happens, happens.”Head coach Jerritt Elliott said Webster, who is a team captain, is as strong as ever and brings a lot of confidence to the team.“She’s probably going to be the best right side blocker in the coun-try,” Elliott said. “She’s extremely physical, and she’s learning how to attack as well on the right side. She can somewhat control outside hit-ters on the opposing team, and it’s nice to see.”Junior utility player Sha’Dare McNeal is impressed with Web-ster’s resilience throughout her re-habilitation process.“It’s amazing to see how she’s held that same emotional stature that she had before the surgery and after the surgery,” McNeal said. “It’s awesome to see her back on the court and back where she started.”Although not playing last season was difficult for Webster and the team, she has learned a lot from watching and believes she has im-proved as a player and person.“It was really hard watching from the sidelines,” Webster said. “But it was good for me to see the game from another perspective. I was able to be more of a leader and cheer on my teammates.”Now, Webster is thankful to be back on the court and support her teammates, who supported her.“At times, it could be a little scary, [but now] I don’t even think about my knee,” Webster said. “It’s just so great to be back with everybody and being treated like everyone else.”behind the sudden instability of college football. “Some of us don’t want it any-more. LHN has already cost [the] Longhorns in lost goodwill, sta-bility and a conference rival.” — comment from RN. Brace yourself for more, RN. There is talk that super confer-ences could align and that Tex-as’ arch nemesis Oklahoma could be jumping to the Pac-12. If the Longhorns don’t follow suit, it’s entirely possible that the Red Riv-er Rivalry, perhaps the finest game in college football, could end.“I don’t think it’s necessary to keep the OU-Texas game if we do move out of a conference with Texas,” Oklahoma head football coach Bob Stoops said Tuesday. “I know no one wants to hear that, but things change.”Once again, all this realign-ment talk was sparked by Texas A&M’s desire to leave the Big 12 and join the Southeastern Confer-ence, which, as you all know, was because of apprehension over the unjust Longhorn Network.The Aggies don’t want to be in the Texas’ conference anymore. Neither does Nebraska, who left for the Big 10 last summer. Now it looks like the Sooners don’t care about sharing a league with the Longhorns, either.“I don’t think that’s necessary,” Stoops said. What’s sadly ironic is that hardly anybody can even watch the damn thing that started all this mess. “LHN is like dark matter. We know it is out there but nobody can see it! I am very, very dis-appointed.” — comment from Stevesiemer. “I live in Oregon. I have wait-ed nine months, salivating for the season to begin and am left out in the cold. No way to receive the [Rice] game. Shit.” — comment from bisalazar. “I live in Minnesota so I can’t even listen on the radio. I would pay anything to see the games. If it weren’t for updates on my Sprint phone, I’d totally be in the dark all season.” — comment from Patikivi. You think these are bad? Wait ‘til you see comments from people who aren’t Texas fans! “Let me understand, this is a government-sponsored school that wants to [screw] the fans. Go anyone else. Houston [Cougars] looked good [Saturday]. Burn the Burnt Orange” — Geomark33. All interesting points. But does anybody sum up the Longhorn Network better than comment-er Rsf? “If last season’s 5-7 season [didn’t do] enough to disenchant fans, this sure will.” “I remember when he first got here, we had to go over repeat-edly on that hill on the practice field and try to get Jaxon to keep from rolling down it,” Brown said. “He and his sisters, they finally got smarter. They got cardboard, and they started sliding down. I saw him as a child, and now, it’s fun to watch him play.”Brown recalls relationship with BYU coaching legendLong before Mack Brown became Texas’ head football coach, he inter-viewed to be an assistant at BYU un-der the legendary LaVelle Edwards, the man who put the Cougars’ foot-ball program on the map.Brown ended up taking a job at Memphis State. Later, when Brown was the wide receivers coach at Southern Miss, he was on the side-line opposite Edwards twice, in 1975 and 1976. The Golden Eagles, who ran an option offense, triumphed, 42-14, in their first meeting with the Cougars. The following year, how-ever, BYU returned the favor, pum-meling Southern Miss, 63-19.“I think ol’ LaVelle woke up and de-cided to stop that option,” Brown said.Longhorns to honor 10th anniversary of Sept. 11Sunday marks the 10-year anni-versary of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The flags around Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium will be at half-staff Saturday and there will be a moment of silence. The Cougars lost the game 34-10 but gained confidence in Heaps, who posted admira-ble stats (15-31, 114 yards, one touchdown). Not eye-popping numbers, but in the not-so-welcoming environment Doak Campbell Stadium is, they’ll do. Gilbert put up similar num-bers in his first official collegiate start at Rice (14-23, 172 yards), and everyone knows the hostil-ity Reliant Stadium brings on a fall Saturday.     Heaps went on to start the rest of the season for the Cou-gars, who finished strong at a 7-6 record, defeating UTEP in the New Mexico Bowl, 52-24. Heaps compiled 2,316 yards passing and broke the all-time freshman touchdown record at BYU (Ty Detmer, 11) with 15 scores. Heaps posted a 57.2 completion percentage, fin-ishing the season with a 116.2 passer rating. Gilbert, on the other hand, finished 2010 with 2,744 yards passing, a 59 per-cent completion. Better yardage but not a better win-loss record.Heaps entered the 2011 sea-son with assurance he’d be the starting quarterback, whereas Gilbert had to fight for his po-sition. This past weekend, BYU traveled to Ole Miss to take on the Rebels in a daring pre-season matchup. Heaps com-pleted 24 of 38 passes for 225 yards and one touchdown as the Cougars came from be-hind to a 14-13 victory. Not to be outdone, Gilbert passed for 239 yards and a touchdown against the Owls on Saturday. The two quarterbacks have al-most mirrored each other sta-tistically over the past season, even coming down to physical stature (Heaps 6 feet 2 inches, 210 lbs.; Gilbert 6 feet 4 inch-es, 215 lbs.).This Saturday, the two quar-terbacks will clash. Don’t be sur-prised if Heaps exposes Texas’ young cornerbacks early because unlike Rice, BYU will throw the ball downfield often. However, if the two quarterbacks maintain their likeness, expect similar sta-tistics from Gilbert.NETWORKcontinues from PAGE 7STATS continues from PAGE 7WEBSTER continues from PAGE 7QUARTERBACK STATSHeaps H.S. statistics — 9,196 yards, 114 touchodwnsNational position ranking (Ri-vals.com) No. 1 (2010)2010-2011 stats: 219-383, 2316 yards, 15 touchdowns 9 inter-ceptions, 57.2 completion per-cent, QB rating of 116Week 1 against Ole Miss: 24-38, 225 yards, 1 touchdown 1 in-terception, 63.2 completion per-cent, QB rating of 116Gilbert H.S. statistics — 12,540 yards, 138 touchdownsNational position ranking No. 2 (2009)2010-2011 stats: 260-411, 2744 yards, 10 touchdowns and 17 in-terceptions, 59  completion per-cent, QB rating of 111Week 1 against Rice: 13-23, 239 yards, 1 touchdown and no interceptions, 56.5 completion percent, QB rating of 158Slow pace to conference realignmentCorey Leamon | Daily Texan file photoTexas and Oklahoma fans form a divide at the Cotton Bowl in last year’s Red River Rivalry. The annual game in Dallas could end if the Sooners leave the Big 12. COUGARScontinues from PAGE 7 At some point, Texas A&M seems destined to end up in the Southeastern Conference, whether Baylor or any other member of the Big 12 likes it or not.Then the focus will turn to Okla-homa. The Sooners leadership, clearly feeling a bit left out with the Aggies and their rivals at Texas hog-ging all realignment spotlight, have made it clear that they’re not about to be “wallflowers” in this high-stakes game of musical chairs.After that, maybe West Virgin-ia will be up for grabs. The SEC could use the Mountaineers to pro-vide some eastern balance to Texas A&M. Or Missouri. Still hoping for the Big Ten to come calling, maybe the Tigers will “settle” for the SEC.Last year, after the Big Ten add-ed Nebraska and the Pac-10 grew by only two, adding Colorado and Utah, many in major college foot-ball let out a collective sigh of relief. The seismic shift many felt was on its way, and not good for the game, did not happen.Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott’s plan for a 16-team league that stretched for the Pacific Northwest to southeast Texas did not come to fruition and spark other changes to major college football’s landscape.But what Scott said at the time turns out to be right. The supercon-ference wasn’t dead, he predicted. It was simply being put on hold.Instead of a giant leap toward further consolidation of power and money, major college foot-ball is getting there through with a series of agonizing half-steps and missteps.Change isn’t coming too fast. The process of conference realignment is actually happening too slowly.The Big 12 is being whittled into extinction. The Big East and the Atlantic Coast Conferences are twisting in uncertainty, won-dering whether their teams are the next targets for the SEC or even the Big Ten.Baylor and the other ugly duck-lings in the Big 12 such as Kansas, Kansas State and Iowa State are facing the possible downgrading of their athletic programs. What if there are no spots left in BCS automatic-qualifying conferences for them?Just go ask SMU, which cur-rently resides in Conference USA and has been practically begging for an invite to the Big 12, how important it is to live in the right neighborhood.“College athletics looks more like Wall Street than a group of in-stitutions of higher learning,” for-mer Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese said Wednesday in a telephone interview.“I don’t know what’s going through the minds of people al-ready having success and wanting to get bigger. Bigger is not neces-sarily better.”Tranghese’s analogy to Wall Street couldn’t have been more per-fect to explain what motivates ath-letic conferences to grow.But at this point we’d all be better off if they just got there already — because this trip is excruciating.By Ralph D.

We are pumped for our third live chat of the year! I’m Sameer Bhuchar, Double Coverage ed-itor, and joining us are football beat writers, Austin Laymance and Christian Corona. They’ll be tak-ing all of your question regarding the upcoming Texas vs BYU game, as well as conference realignment issues. Ready? Set? Go!Question from Trevor: What do you think Texas’ big-gest challenge will be on Satur-day?Austin: Controlling the line of scrim-mage will be paramount. Texas needs a better performance in the trenches than we saw last week against Rice when the Owls rushed for 130 yards.Christian: BYU’s a lot better than Rice, es-pecially up front. Texas’ defensive line, which had trouble stopping the run last week, will have their hands full with the Cougars’ O-line. Not a man below 295 pounds there.Question from Jenny Are we going to see Heaps of trouble from the BYU offense?Sameer: Nice pun JennyChristian: Rice didn’t challenge Texas in the downfield passing game but Heaps definitely will. But the way the secondary played in the open-er makes it seem as though they’ll be up for the challenge.Austin: I think Texas will limit the BYU offense enough to win. They should get a better pass rush and create some havoc in the back-field.  Christian: Diaz said Rice threw 3 passes farther than 7 yards in the air last weekend. That will change when Texas plays BYU.  Sameer: While on the topic of new com-ponents to the team (Diaz), a read-er has a question about the fresh-manQuestion From TerryWhich Texas freshmen really stood out in your eyes?  Christian: Jaxon Shipley was outstanding his college debut. Made a sensa-tional TD catch on the WR reverse pass and even provided a spark out of the backfield. Austin:Joe Bergeron is a guy that could really emerge as a legitimate threat out of the Texas backfield. He came in before fellow frosh Mal-colm Brown and made the most out of his carries. Sameer: That Shipley catch was stellar, and the play was creative. Certain-ly something that we didn’t see un-der the Greg Davis offense  Question from Brett:What did you think of the of-fense’s new playing style under Bryan Harsin? Does the offense need time to adjust to it?Austin:I liked that Harsin moved play-ers and shifted formations. They had Rice scrambling on defense and took advantage on some trick plays. Texas made a big commit-ment to running the ball, which was nice to see.Question From Mary What does the return of Mar-quise Goodwin mean for Texas’ receiving corps?Sameer: Now that the Horns have Good-win back at receiver, how do you guys think Harsin will utilize him? Mary has a similar question....Christian: Even though Marquise will need some time to readjust to playing football again, he provides a light-ning quick threat that defenses have to respect.Austin:Goodwin’s return will expand Harsin’s playbook even more. Look for the Longhorns to get some spe-cial packages that fit Goodwin’s skill set. He could get the ball on a reverse or a be a target down field on a flea-flicker type pass.Christian: He and DJ Monroe were part of a relay team that finished the 4x100 in under 40 seconds. The Longhorns have plenty of speed at their disposal.Sameer: One important point we haven’t discussed yet was the play of Gil-bert...after all, he was the subject of much controversy this offseason...Ambra wonders the same.Question From Ambra: What do you think of Garrett Gilbert’s play? Christian: Garrett Gilbert was much bet-ter than he was last year against Rice (and most of the season for that mat-ter) but you could still see him lock in on receivers and overthrow others.Austin: Gilbert made some good throws (two 50 plus yard bombs to Mike Davis) and some bad ones. He still misses his target on some throws, which perplexes me considering he’s the state’s prep leader in pass-ing yards. But overall, a good per-formance. He didn’t turn the ball over, made plays with his feet, and executed the game plan.Christian: BYU, like Texas, didn’t give up an offensive TD in their first game. Cougars will present much tough-er challenge.Sameer: The stat line doesn’t indicate it Ambra, but he was much more poised...though he has a lot more to work on  Austin: Gilbert also made some poor decisions, like his ill-advised pitch to Fozzy Whittaker under pressure that could have easily been a turn-over.Christian: The fact that he did not turn the ball over, however, was extreme-ly encouraging. Ball security is a big point of emphasis for him this year. Question From PhilpotWill BYU be offended by the dirty words in Texas Fight?Austin: Good question Philpot. I say they won’t be too offended consid-ering they have some athletes who broke the school’s honor code.Christian: Not as offended as Texas was when it heard when BYU basket-ball player Brandon Davies broke his honor code.Sameer: I don’t even think they’ll like the word “fight”Austin: Jimmer Freddette might have his ears plugged on the sidelines.Question from Trever: I thought the TE position was supposed to be taken care of with Irby, Terrell and Grant, what hap-pened in week 1?Sameer: Thanks for bringing us back treverChristian: Well Blaine Irby dropped the only pass thrown to him, which is understandable considering his long time away from the game and the fact that it was the same play he got hurt on three years ago. He has great hands and should be back to form this weekend.Austin: Irby missed his chance and dropped the only ball that came his way. Granted, he hadn’t played in 3 seasons. But I see him improv-ing, along with the entire team, from week to week. They blocked well, though, as Texas rushed for over 200 yards.Christian: But Irby and some other tight ends need to step up soon because Harsin’s offense calls for 2-3 tight ends on the field every now and then.Austin: The tight ends are a big key to the offensive success, Mack Brown says, so they will need to step up if Texas wants to get back to a bowl game.BYU game, Gilbert hot topics in football chatDOUBLE COVERAGE LIVE CHAT Cowboys are most valuable NFL franchise POLL: WHERE DO  YOU THINK TEXAS WILL BE PLAYING NEXT YEAR?Pac 16 ( 40% )Big 12 ( 40% )Independent ( 20% )Other ( 0% )By Sameer Bhuchar, Austin Laymance & Christian CoronaDaily Texan Staff NEW YORK — The Dallas Cow-boys are the NFL’s most valuable fran-chise at $1.85 billion, according to Forbes magazine’s annual survey  .That also gives the Cowboys the highest worth of any U.S. team, and makes them second only to Man-chesteUnited  of the English Premier League, valued at $1.9 billion , among franchises worldwide.The New York Yankees are worth $1.7 billion  , according to Forbes’ most recent baseball calculations.Following the Cowboys in val-ue among NFL teams are the Wash-ington Redskins ($1.55 billion), New England Patriots ($1.4 billion), New York Giants ($1.3 billion) and New York Jets ($1.223 billion).Altogether, 15 teams are worth $1 billion; the others are Houston, Phil-adelphia, Chicago, Green Bay, Bal-timore, Indianapolis, Denver, Pitts-burgh, Miami and Carolina.The survey is based on the 2010 season. Team values are through this year’s lockout, but total revenues and profits are not.Dallas’ value increased 2 percent from last year’s rankings. The biggest jump was made by the Giants, up 10 percent, after they moved into their new stadium in 2010. The Jets, who share that stadium with the Giants, were up 7 percent, as were the Su-per Bowl champion Packers, who are community-owned, and the San Fran-cisco 49ers.Eighteen teams increased in value, five remained the same — including the Redskins — and nine decreased in worth. Coincidentally, the biggest drop was made by the Tampa Bay Bucca-neers (5 percent), who are owned by the Glazer family that also owns Man-chester United.Least in value, Forbes reports, are the Jacksonville Jaguars ($725 million).The average team value is $1.036 billion.Dallas also had the highest rev-enues, $406 million, well ahead of Washington at $352 million. Lowest was Oakland at $217 million.By James AronThe Associated Press10 COMICS10 Thursday, September 8, 2011COMICSYesterday’s solutionArrr matey.

Participants Atkins, 17, and Mari-ah Steele, 16, created films centered on the troubles they have not only faced but also overcome.“I filmed a short on my own about doors. I’ve always seen doors as in-timidating, so I wanted to use that as a symbolic coming out type of thing,” Steele said. “It shows what I have gotten past, being shut out of doors like being shut out of different groups of people.”However, Livingston expressed that a recurring message of this year’s festival was community and how there is a growing sense of it in Austin between the GLBT commu-nity and its allies. “It should be a very affirming ex-perience to be put on equal footing with a full-on filmmaker,” Livings-ton said. “And that’s kind of what it’s about, boosting these young people and teaching them that they shouldn’t be afraid to tell their stories.”While QYMP and AGLIFF per-tain to a specific genre of film and a specific group of people, both Liv-ingston and Gonzales express a de-sire for Austin to look past that.“I think what the project taught me most was that GLBT youth aren’t really all that different from regular youth,” Gonzales said. “Re-gardless of how any youth identifies, what they ultimately need is the love and support from not only family and friends but also from their com-munity. And to know that someone is loved and accepted by their com-munity is just about the message that any youth can get.”first performance together since 1989. The duo said they are ready to make it happen and promises to ex-ert a high, dancey energy, bringing fun and flashback to the celebration. They also hope to encourage audi-ences to be themselves.“Humanity should be without cat-egories — if we can understand we’re all beautiful spirits, we’ll be fine,” said Johnican. “You have labels and con-ditions, but it doesn’t make a differ-ence. Nobody’s able to be blessed in these conditions, but you yourself can be a blessing for other people.”Jacinta, a singer-songwriter and DJ, shares a similar message. “Austin has a beautiful growth with an attitude that is realizing peo-ple are people, love is love, and we’re all individuals and need to respect each other.”Originally from Australia, Jacinta has been living in Texas for nearly a decade. She has performed in pride events across the country and GLBT events in New York, Chicago, Seat-tle and Oregon, encouraging her lis-teners to follow the light from inside themselves.Shunda K and Shon B plan to spread a more distinct message through their Christian yet sexually explicit lyrics. The rap duo goes by Yo! Majesty and strongly advocates its belief in God and its “what you see is what you get” approach to life.“We are who we are. We are gay females. We talk about what’s real, so with us, it’s about being real,” Shunda said. “Pride is a great revo-lution. I’m gay too, so I’m obliged to be a part of it.”While Yo! Majesty is grateful for the opportunity to spread their word at the festival, they are not just performing for Austin, rather, the whole world that seems to be spin-ning out of control. We’re trying to create a balance, Shunda said.11 ENTUIVSTEBZ\u0001\u0019\u0001♥\u0001GSJEBZ\u0010TBUVSEBZ\u0001\u0019\u0001\u0007\u0001\u0012\u0011\u0016\u0013\u0016\u0001FBTU\u0001\u0017UI\u0001\tBU\u0001SFE\u0001SJWFS\u0001♥ \u0014\u0013\u0011\u000e\u0011\u0016\u0016\u0014XXX\u000fFTUIFSTGPMMJFT\u000fDPN\u0001♥\u0001SFTFSWFE\u0001TFBUJOH\u0001BWBJMBCMFOPU\u0001WBMJE\u0001BGUFS\u0001OPW\u000f\u0001\u0014\u0011\u0001\u0013\u0011\u0011\u0017THUR & FRI SHOWNOT VALID AFTER OCT. 31, 2011AGOODOLDFASHIONEDORGYffff“A WEIRD KIND OFTRIUMPH.”-Joshua Rothkopf, TIME OUT NEW YORKTYLERLABINENICKKROLLMICHELLEBORTHLAKEBELLLESLIEBIBBJASONSUDEIKISWILLFORTEANDLUCYPUNCHMARTINSTARRLINDSAYSLOANEANGELASARAFYANA COMEDY ABOUTOLD FRIENDS IN NEW POSITIONSAGOODOLDFASHIONEDORGY-MOVIE.COM FACEBOOK.COM/AGOFO“ABSURDLYBRILLIANT.”-Jarett Wieselman, NEWYORKPOST.COMNOW PLAYING IN SELECT THEATERSGo to agoodoldfashionedorgy-movie.com for theaters and showtimes������������������������ ��www.shaolinmovie-us.comALSO AVAILABLE ON DEMANDANDY LAU NICHOLAS TSEJACKIE CHANSPECIALAPPEARANCEBYALAMO DRAFTHOUSE LAKE CREEK 13729 Research Blvd. 8 (512) 219-5408 • www.drafthouse.com • CALL THEATER FOR SHOWTIMESThe Internet connects all sorts of people — friends with friends, strangers with strangers, employ-ers with employees and, to the chagrin of culprits worldwide, law enforcement with criminals. It’s an eyebrow-raising concept — police officers combing Craig-slist, Twitter and Facebook sta-tuses for evidence of wrongdoing. But with more than 940 million social networking users world-wide, according to InSites consult-ing, what people share online has become an important element of crime investigation. A whole new crime-fighting venue has emerged and authorities in cities from Lon-don to New York to right here on campus have taken notice. “It’s become one of our go-to things in almost any investi-gation if we’re looking for some-one or something,” said UT Po-lice Department Sgt. Chris Bon-net. “We’ll look on different so-cial media sites, and not just so-cial media, but also Craigslist or eBay if we’re looking for prop-erty. If we’re looking for a per-son, almost always we’ll look at social media, just to see what’s out there.”Law enforcement agencies inter-nationally have similar ideas. Dur-ing the recent chaos in the UK, Scot-land Yard and other organizations tracked down looters with their in-criminating photos and posts on Facebook and Twitter — tools that the looters themselves used to orga-nize. And in August, the New York Police Department announced the creation of a unit whose job, accord-ing to the New York Daily News, is to “mine social media, looking for info about troublesome house par-ties, gang showdowns and other potential mayhem.” Unlike the NYPD, Bonnet said UTPD doesn’t “fish” for random troublemakers, which would re-quire a lot of resources the de-partment doesn’t  have and might send the wrong message to students. “I don’t think UTPD would ever be the type of department that’s digging into peoples’ business with no cause to,” Bonnet said. “That would kind of cut down on our proactive surfing around. People say things all the time that could be taken out of context. We like to have some kind of context be-fore we go looking at peoples’ Facebook pages.”Instead, Bonnet and other on-campus police officers employ meth-ods that have been instrumental in solving numerous cases. They use photos and posts that students and staff share on the Internet to provide insight and clues to ongoing inves-tigations. These online observations aren’t necessarily useful in court, but online updates that identify where people were and what they were do-ing at specific times are “very useful” when it comes to confirming what’s true or not.  “It’s useful in any number of things,” Bonnet said. “If we have someone who is maybe a person of interest or a suspect, it doesn’t hurt to see what kind of pictures they have or what they’re saying about them-selves online. What they say their fa-vorite movie is or who they admire can tell you whether or not they might be the person you’re interest-ed in.”UTPD’s jurisdiction extends throughout the 40 Acres and also on the University’s off-campus sites, leaving other student-heavy areas such as West Campus, Riv-erside and Far West to the Aus-tin Police Department’s watch. APD didn’t return calls for com-ment, so how the organization uses social media to do its job is unclear. Bonnet said that they at least use it the same way UTPD does — it’s a necessary element in many investigations.“We’d be foolish not to look at social media,” Bonnet said. “It’s a great source of information for us.”Life&Artsthursday, september 8, 2011 11 STORYcontinues from PAGE 12By Aaron WestDaily Texan StaffPRIDEcontinues from PAGE 12Police scour social media for evidencePu Ying Huang | Daily texan staffSocial media sites are becoming an important investigative tool for solving crimes. With more than 940 million users all over the world, sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Craigslist provide insightful information to law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies use clues from websites to track criminal offendersHaving a gay or lesbian young person share their struggles of ac-ceptance with their community can be one of the most rewarding ex-periences, if they are brave enough to do it, said John Livingston, the board of directors president for the Austin Gay and Lesbian Interna-tional Film Festival.”After all, we can’t expect peo-ple to include us if we don’t in-c lude  them,”  he said.The Austin Gay and Lesbi-an International Film Festival, in partnership with Out Youth and Austin School of Film, offers a select group of teenagers the opportunity to build a relation-ship with the community through filmmaking in a program called the Queer Youth Media Project. “For me, it is taking a young per-son who is interested in film — they don’t have to want to go to film school, they don’t even have to be gay or lesbian — and teaching them how to tell their story and get it in front of an audience,” Livingston said. “And film and cinema is such a great way to do that. A picture tells a thousand words, a moving picture tells millions of words.” The students learn everything from filming and cinematography to scripting and editing to market-ing their film to various festivals. They also get to screen their work at South by Southwest and the Austin Gay and Lesbian International Film Festival. “Ultimately, I hope it helps some-one who doesn’t know if it will be okay, and I hope it’ll speak to them that it will be [OK] and that they don’t have to be forced into stereo-types or act certain ways,” said Reu-ben Atkins, one of the three partici-pants in this year’s project.The Queer Youth Media Project was largely revamped about three years ago by the program director at the time, Jake Gonzales. As some-one who learned to make films in high school, he was excited about the opportunity to educate young people about film and taught around half the classes while he was there.“ The  f i lms made the first year  were so e y e - o p e n i n g for our audi-ence. A lot of people in the GLBT commu-nity think that our young peo-ple have it easier,” Gonzales said. “But what someone who came out in their late 20s doesn’t un-derstand is that it’s just as hard. It’s a whole different set of prob-lems. And those films, in a very unique way, showed the audience what the youth were actually go-ing through.”This year, the short films will be edited into a compilation to be shown with a feature documenta-ry film called “This is What Love in Action Looks Like” about a young man forced to attend camp to “fix” his sexuality. The screening is free and open to the public but will be especially relatable and relevant to a young audience.12 LIFETickets & information:  acl-live.com ≥ Waterloo Records ≥ 877 435 9849AUSTIN CITY LIMITS LIVE AT THE MOODY THEATERON SALE FRIDAY · 10AM!All dates, acts, ticket prices subject to change w/o notice.

With an established and grow-ing lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-gender and queer communi-ty, this year will mark Austin’s 20th Pride Celebration. The Austin Gay and Lesbian Pride Foundation, whose purpose is to ed-ucate, connect and strengthen the GLBT community, is organizing the celebration. The foundation antici-pates this year’s event to be the most successful yet.The festivities are a way to be ourselves, we’re not a special thing, we are simply people, said Nathan James, Director of Entertainment for the AGLPF. James said people from small towns are drawn to Aus-tin and feel comforted in know-ing there are individuals similar to them.“We extend our Austin com-munity to smaller bases and allow them to know we exist. People can learn to accept themselves and in-teract with those who surround them,” James said.Indeed, the performers lined up for the festival reflect this sense of unity. Artists at the festival range from rap groups to techno, with some comedy in between. There will also be a mix of local artists, along with artists who will be traveling from the east and west coasts.One such group, Ejector, will be traveling from San Francisco to join the festivities. With a very European-electro style, Ejector promises theat-ricality with dark latex and leather. Visually, the band is a breed of sci-fi mixed with James Bond, bring-ing prop laser guns to the stage. Lead singer Ben Holder said that the band will hook the audience with melody lines you can sing along to.Ejector also brings to the stage a message of positivity and overcoming personal turmoil. “We try to reach cities through mu-sic,” Holder said. “Though we have a great fan base at home, we want to see how people in Austin will perceive us. It’s the next step, a big music town with experience and attitude.”Lil ‘P (Phyllis Charles) and Sweet LD (Djuana J. Johnican) of Oak-town’s 3.5.7, a female rap group created by MC Hammer, will also be making an appearance.
