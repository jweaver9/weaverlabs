I explore the findings of interviews with eight queer student activists, whom were active between 2003 and 2006, in which they discuss their understandings of queer student activism and the way they see the university setting shaping their activism. These findings illustrate how the intersections of queer, student, activism, and their associated contexts, create a particular type of activism. This article thus contributes to queer history by demonstrating how one specific cultural subset does queer activism.  Key words: Queer activism, queer studies, queer media, queer students, student activism, student media.    Queer, student, activism.  Introduction Queer students are an important aspect of Australian tertiary communities. Many Australian tertiary student activists identify as queer. There is a National Union of Students (NUS) queer department, two NUS queer officers, an annual NUS queer student conference (Queer Collaborations), queer departments and officers in student unions across Australia, and designated queer spaces in Australian universities and dozens of queer student publications.   There is a considerable amount of US research which investigates queer youth organising in universities and high schools, or the institutional structures that support them. Mark Pendleton (2007) and Rob Cover (2004) document anti-capitalist perspectives in Australian queer, predominantly student, activism from 1999-2002. Daniel Marshall (2005) examines the work done by the Gay Teachers and Students Group (GTSG). Graham Willett (2000, 2002) and Robert Reynolds (2002) consider the role of queer university students in early Australian queer activism. Beyond this work, Australian queer students are unstudied.   Accounts of queer history in general tend to have a US focus. I have included Australian history throughout this article; however, there is limited work in comparison to US sources. This US-centricity highlights the importance of this paper to the field.   Queer studies emphasises the significance of exploring the identity intersections which shape activism and politics, and their effects (See for example, Davy 1995; Harper et al. 1997; Barnard 1999; Mizielinska 2001; Eng, Halberstam and Muñoz 2005). This perspective argues that an individual’s position in society is not only shaped by their, for example, sexuality, but their gender, socio-economic position, ability, ethnicity etc. The intersection of these elements determines one’s experience and privilege. This means that an individual may be oppressed as, for example, a gay man, but they also have certain privileges as a white male. The application of an identity intersections perspective allows for the troubling of varying relationships of power in queer politics. Thus, this article explores interviews with queer student activists, involved in the production of queer student media, demonstrating that the university setting shapes a particular type of queer activism.    Contextualising queer student activism and media This queer student activism is part of a rich history of Australian queer student activism dating back to early 1970s.  The activism under examination here is produced in an educated, largely white middle-class university environment. The demography of the queer student activist communities under investigation would somewhat mirror these statistics, as these communities exist in the same university environment. The contexts and constraints of the middle-class university environment inform queer student activism.  Scope and method The data that I analyse in this article is from interviews collected for a larger project which investigates representations of queer, queer identity and queer activism in Australian queer student media. I interviewed eight queer student activists that were involved in the production of the queer student media produced between 2003 and 2006. I conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews. Questions and topics of conversation examined understandings of queer student activism, and the impact of editorial processes and the setting of university activism on the representation of queer in publications. In this paper, I examine two themes that arose during the interviews: visibility and access and participation.  These themes demonstrate student understandings of their activism and their recognition of its specificity.   Visibility  Visible to the university community  Three interviewees see visibility as key to queer student activism and its educative role.  For example,    See example one  Here visibility is spoken about as being important for educating university communities about queers to aid integration, and for helping queers to feel like that they do not stand out. Queer Theory argues that heteronormativity dominates Western society.  Heteronormativity others queers and normalises heterosexuality. Invisibility and oppression are results of this othering. Visibility helps create awareness and debunk stereotypes. This understanding of queer activism is one which normalises queers and educates the public that queers are not different.  To the interviewee, these are important steps in addressing prejudice.  Visibility to queers Three interviewees see visibility as valuable for other queers. Bina speaks about this: See example two.   Visibility enables queers to see other queers and plays an initial step in individuals understanding that they are not alone. Seeing one’s self is an important part of identity and self esteem development (Cover 2002). Seeing other queers may give queer individuals confidence to come out, or contribute to an improvement of self esteem. This type of visibility also acts as a form of normalisation, allowing queers to realise that they are not abnormal.  There is a prevalence of mental health issues amongst queers; recognising that one is not completely alone nor different is a key step for well-being, and can assist in preventing depression and other illnesses.1 This type of visibility links to the social and support roles of queer activism, which interviewees identified as important to their queer student activism. Visibility – seeing other queers – lays the foundation for socialising and receiving support.   Visibility in historical activism   Visibility also played an important role in early Australian Gay Liberation. According to Robert Reynolds, 1970 to 1973 was ‘a crucial phase in the creation of a [Australian] homosexual activist, who was, in CAMP’s own words “open” and “proud”’ (2002, 31.) The second editorial of CampInk included the statement ‘It is time for us to come out of the shadows and loudly demand our rights as human beings’ (in Reynolds 2002, 32). In Australia, CAMP’s first public demonstration was in 1971 in Sydney (Reynolds 2002, 41). This was the first homosexual demonstration in Australia (Reynolds 2002, 41). The protest took place outside Sydney’s Liberal Party headquarters and was a high camp event (Reynolds 2002, 42). This act of visibility improved a number of CAMP members’ self confidence (Reynolds 2002, 42-43). Soon after, CAMP Brisbane held a public action in the City Square. They spoke ‘calmly to people’. Based on the success of this action, later that week they ‘distributed sweets in the Square ... We were ulterior about our banners, placards and pamphlets. People even believed our signs: “Gay is Good,” “Lesbians are Lovely,” “I like Men” and read our pamphlets. We enjoyed ourselves in the sun. We felt our gay pride’ (Reynolds 2002: 43). These acts of visibility also serve an educational, identity formation and support role. They informed the public about homosexuality and help build confidence for those participating, and perhaps also for those not-yet-out queers watching on. This history situates queer student activist discussions about visibility in the history of Australian queer activism.    Access and participation – university contexts                                                  1Private Lives was the largest study of GLBTI people in Australia and one of the largest in the world and surveyed 5476 people between the ages of 16 and 92 (Pitts et al. 2006, 14). The report noted that nearly 75% of the sample reported some experience of depression in the past (Pitts et al. 2006, 10). Private Lives reported, ‘It is of particular concern that 16% of all respondents indicated suicidal ideation (thoughts) in the two weeks prior to completing the survey’ (Pitts et al. 2006, 10). These statistics were also reflected in Writing Themselves in Again, an Australian study on same-sex attracted youth (Hillier, Mitchell and Turner 2005). Self-harm, involving either attempted suicide or self-mutilation, was reported by 35% of respondents (Hillier, Mitchell and Turner 2005, viii).  Students see the university setting as shaping a particular type of queer activism and discuss the limitations that they see of this. Two of the factors which the interviewees discuss as contributing to the particular shape of queer student activism are access and participation.  The university setting limits access and participation in regards to who can attend university, and thus become involved in tertiary queer student activism. Two interviewees spoke of this: See example three:   Community media expert Ellie Rennie notes that access and participation are key factors in the organisation of community media (2006, 3). I have previously signalled that the demography of universities impacts on the participation in queer student activism. Discussing the middle-class presence in queer activism, sociologist Allan Sinfield (1996) and activist Pat Hussain (1997) state that it takes a certain amount of resources to participate in activism, something that people in certain socio-economic circumstances may not have to spare  (1996, 272; 1997,  242). In the setting of tertiary queer student media, this combines with the demographics of the university institution, to further limit who can participate in in queer student activism and queer student media.   Further to the issue of voluntarism, the university setting can also limit how much time university students can commit to participating in the production of queer student media.  See example four.  These students extensively discussed a range of pressures and concerns. Four spoke about difficulties in getting other students to participate or submit content. Two interviewees spoke about the large workload combined with their other commitments. Two interviewees mentioned that they included everything that was submitted in their publications – they were grateful to receive content and thus published it all. Community media researchers Chris Atton and James Hamilton note that the voluntarism approach of a lot of community media ‘restricts the type of people who might participate… Not everyone will be in a stable enough economic situation to be able to afford to dedicate themselves to a project that offers little or no financial reward’ (2008: 50). Study, employment and other commitments influence how much time students can commit to the production of queer student media. While time and workload pressures would be present in most media production, the queer student media setting is one where a restricted commitment can be made to the production of media opposed to, for example, a full-time paid editorial position. So, although the university context aids the production of queer student media by providing funds and policy to enable production, it is not immune from the effects of voluntarism that are common to community media. Media theorist Chris Downing mentions activist burn out (2001: 389), which was also mentioned by some of the interviewees. Some refer to the regular overturn of paid editors of the Sydney Star Observer (Goddard 1996: 16; Scahill 2001: 186). This demonstrates the presence of burnout in other queer community media. In these ways, the production context of queer student media is similar to that of other community media, despite being located in the institutional setting.   Thus, while we might conceptualise queer student media as an invaluable opportunity for queer youth to construct a voice and community, it is critical to recognise the factors that influence which queer youth get to speak about queer activism in queer student media. Further, the socio-cultural contexts influence what is said. They do this by contributing to the way students’ understandings of queer activism are shaped, and by shaping experiences of students who are speaking about queer activism. Access to, and participation in, queer student media which is shaped by a number of factors – including those integral to the university setting – mitigates who gets to speak about queer activism and what they say.   Identity intersections are a key framework for discussing privilege and oppression in queer studies. These students’ acknowledgement of the university setting and the way it impacts on their queer activism is a moment of queer activist reflection about intersections. In their discussion about access to universities they recognise their activism as limited in terms of who can access university activism and participate in it. The students recognise a context-specific position. The interviewees’ activism is not just queer activism. It is queer student activism, and thus is specific to that context.   Conclusion   Cathy J Cohen states that queer politics have failed to consider multiple elements of identity. Cohen calls for further considerations of identity intersections and varying relationships of power in queer politics (2005, 31). Mainstream gay and lesbian rights organisations are criticised for the white middle-class focus of their activism (Bérubé 2001; Massad 2002; Cohen 2005; Riggs 2006). These organisations are argued to be exclusionary of queers of lower socio-economic demographics, queers of colour and queers who do not fit into their limited constructions of queer identity. Queer student activism is not immune to a white middle-class critique given that it is situated firmly in the university. However, the interviewees’ reflections of how the university shapes their queer activism demonstrate some awareness of these limitations. This awareness works towards troubling power relationships in queer politics, which can lead to positive change within activist practice.  ",
