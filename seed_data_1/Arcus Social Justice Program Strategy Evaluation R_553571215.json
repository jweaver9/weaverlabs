The evalua-tion focuses on full data sets from 2018-2019 and includes a mix of exit and transition grants (mostly in 2018) and grants awarded in 2018 and 2019 that advanced the updat-ed strategy. Given the emphasis on early implementation, this report focuses primarily on learnings and preliminary strategy adjustment recommendations, as opposed to deep quantitative assessment aligned with the evaluation framework’s indicators. Once more data and information are available, future evaluation reports will provide more insight on indicator progress.The SJ strategy focuses on four geographical regions and a subset of focal countries and states within those regions. The focus regions are East Africa, Southern Africa, Meso-america and the Caribbean, and the Southern Tier of the United States. Across these geographic focus regions, the SJ strategy seeks to achieve three overarching goals: 1) Increased safety for LGBTQ people; 2) Increased LGBTQ- affirming protections; and 3) Increased inclusion and acceptance of LGBTQ people. SJ Program grantees work to address one or more of these goals, and progress is as-sessed using a series of indicators with baseline measures that were developed with feedback from grantees and the field. Each goal’s indicators relate to a set of assumptions underpinning our Theory of Change that are either validat-ed or challenged by the data collected.Information and data sourced for this report came from the Foundation’s Fluxx database, grantee reports, media reports and scans, and an applicant survey conducted to assess the Foundation’s 2019 Call for Concepts process. As the updated strategy is early in its implementation, some data points may paint an incomplete picture, and methods of data collection will likely be refined in future iterations of this evaluation report. Where these factors may be present, the authors note the methodology and criteria applied. Data includes 2018-2019 grantmaking across the U.S. and International portfolios totaling $29,435,500—with a subtotal for on-strate-gy grantmaking of $23,652,500. Of these, faith-focused grants totaled $6,315,500 or 21 percent, and trans-focused grants totaled $7,623,500 or 28 percent. In addition to the Foundation’s grantmaking data, key outcomes and setbacks under each goal area and region are included to highlight where many of the learnings  were derived. Key LearningsThe “Where, What, & Who” We Fund:n The identification of geographic priority regions,  countries and states resulted in a significant shift in the types of grants considered and recommended.n Approximately half of SJ funding was focused on in-creased protections (Goal 2), followed—in almost equal parts—by increased safety (Goal 1) and acceptance/ inclusion (Goal 3).n The focus on groups pushed to the margins needs to  be continually pursued, measured, and effectively  communicated; a new racial, gender, and economic jus-tice lens1 process will help provide a level of accountabili-ty and assessment.n The Foundation’s investments in trans-led and trans- focused organizations and projects increased and will meet the public commitment made in December 2015.n Intermediaries and pooled funds remain important to  the strategy.Strategic Learningsn Movements building power through long-term community organizing are resilient in geographic focus areas despite hostile environments; they remain a necessary anchor for sustainable social change.n Impact litigation (i.e., lawsuits brought with the intent  to seek broad legal and social change beyond relief for  the individual plaintiff(s)) emerged as a concrete policy- change strategy in the international portfolio because they have the potential to repeal criminal provisions and recognize trans identities across all of our regions, but notably in Botswana, Kenya, and Barbados.n In the U.S., grantees continue to work toward decades- long goals pertaining to transformational change,  such as the dismantling and reimagining of systems and cultural beliefs that have harmed LGBTQ people; while at the same time remaining nimble and strategic to deploy Executive SummarySOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | STRATEGY EVALUATION REPORT: 2018-2019 | AUGUST 20202PAGEIntegration of Faith and Trans Across all  Goal Areasn LGBT faith movements abroad are largely inward-oriented,  focused on building LGBTI communities of faith, personal reconciliation of sexuality and faith, and acceptance as LGBT persons within their larger communities of faith. Faith-based policy advocacy is very limited.n Authentically integrating faith-focused grants in the U.S. docket has taken longer than other parts of the strategy.n Trans communities are developing rapidly, but most are relatively small and lack country and international level consultation mechanisms, such as conferences, reports, and strategic planning.n Resourcing of trans-led and trans-serving work continues to be low both in the U.S. and internationally.Opportunities for ChangeInternational Focal Regionsn The Inter-American Court of Human Rights’ advisory  opinion 24/2017 prompted national level litigation among members of the Organization of American States.n Successful litigation to repeal criminal provisions against LGBT people in Commonwealth countries such as Belize, India, and Trinidad & Tobago increases the prospects of successful similar initiatives in Africa and the Caribbean.n Mexico’s three government branches have progressive leadership at the federal level, which has created a policy opportunity at national level, as well in many states.U.S. Focal Statesn The U.S. political environment—as harmful and vitriolic as it is—presents opportunities for change we have not seen in generations, as evidenced by the rapid cultural shift brought about by the Black Lives Matter movement.responsive organizing tactics to urgent and inhumane situations (e.g. family separations at the southern border;  murders of Black men, women, trans and gender noncon-forming people).n Definitions of “safety” in the SJ strategy need to  be refined.Beyond Grantmakingn In 2018-2019, the SJ Program did not engage  in capacity development of grantees beyond its grant-making. Any technical assistance and training came pri-marily through funded intermediaries and pooled funds.The Open Call Processn An Open Call for Concepts in 2018 helped identify many new grantees in the focal geographic areas, but was a much larger undertaking than anticipated.Challenges Anti-LGBTQ & Anti-Human Rights Oppositionn Conservative movements have increased their influence  in regional human rights systems.n Conservative governments are in power in most focus countries, including the U.S., which limits the change  that can come from executive and legislative branches  of governments.n Civil society space is being limited in several countries and the trend indicates a further decrease.Threats to Safetyn Violence against LGBT people, including activists, by both law enforcement and private individuals is increasing.n The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant threat for 2020 and beyond. SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | STRATEGY EVALUATION REPORT: 2018-2019 | AUGUST 20203PAGEIntroductionThis report is one in a series commissioned internally by Arcus to assess progress, against pre-determined indicators, in implementation of the Foundation’s updated social justice grantmaking strategy. 2019 was the first full year dedicated to the strategy, giving us the possibility to present principal learnings so far, and to note positive developments, oppor-tunities for growth or course correction, as well as critical questions and recommendations as we move forward.The report also covers 2018, a year in which some grants advanced the updated strategy, while many others were exit grants awarded to groups which we transitioned out in a manner consistent with philanthropic best practices.2Since this report covers the strategy’s earliest implementa-tion activities, our evaluation has focused on learnings and recommended adjustments instead of a more quantitative indicator-by-indicator assessment. In future years, as more data and information are available, evaluation reports will more closely track progress against the indicators.The Social Justice Strategy and  Its Underlying AssumptionsThe Social Justice program strategy consists of three  overarching goal areas that apply to the two main SJ  portfolios—U.S. and International. These goals are:1. Increased safety for LGBTQ people;2. Increased LGBTQ-affirming protections; and3. Increased inclusion and acceptance of LGBTQ people.While some of our grantees work specifically in one of these goal areas, many advance their missions more holistically, with activities spanning two or all three.Integrated into the SJ goals are the following priorities  and values:n Cross-movement collaboration and coordination.n Establishment of durable networks, especially among  the most marginalized communities.n Efforts led by and for the communities most affected  (the principle of self-determination).n Initiatives led by faith, trans, and other groups with less access to resources and who are marginalized within LGBTQ communities.n Inclusion of those most marginalized in decision-making and organizational leadership; andn Work that increases the political power of constituencies to influence change through civic engagement and  democratic participation.The Program’s evaluation framework includes a series of  indicators with baseline measures that were developed in part by consulting the existing literature on measuring movement building, policy change and acceptance. The  initial draft indicators were reviewed by groups of grantees who provided feedback in an effort to ensure that the strate-gy’s measures were consistent with realities in the field.3The strategy focuses on four large geographical regions:  East Africa, Southern Africa, Mesoamerica and the  Caribbean, and the Southern Tier of the U.S. Within each, most of our support is directed to the following focal  countries and states:n East Africa: Kenya, Ugandan Southern Africa: Botswana, Malawi, South African Mesoamerica and the Caribbean: Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Guyana, Trinidad & Tobagon Southern Tier of the U.S.: Arizona, Central Valley of  California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, New MexicoIn developing the Social Justice Program strategy, staff  identified the following assumptions that underlie the  program’s theory of change:n Collection and use of documentation will improve the willingness and ability of officials to address violence.n Increased coordination of activists (including faith  leaders) will improve efforts to address violence.n Advocates will need to work to convince authorities to  use the documentation and overcome resistance.n Advocacy success is dependent on:  • More effective alliances with non-LGBTQ networks. • A larger and engaged base.  • Increased visible leadership of marginalized LGBTQ populations. •  Increased advocacy capacity.SafetyGOAL 1ProtectionsGOAL 2SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | STRATEGY EVALUATION REPORT: 2018-2019 | AUGUST 20204PAGEMany of the learnings and recommendations in this report refer back to these assumptions, at times validating them, and at times challenging them.n Other drivers identified: coordinated messaging,  positive statements from opinion leaders, secular and faith; positive media reporting; visibility of faith and  secular leaders in media; more positive framing of issue  in public debates.Acceptance/InclusionGOAL 3MethodsThe following data and information sources were used as the basis for the learnings, challenges, opportunities, outcomes and recommendations included in this report: 1) grant data obtained by the Foundation’s Fluxx database; 2) grantee grant reports; 3) media reports and contracted media scans; 4) data and findings from the Center for Effective Philanthro-py’s survey of applicants that responded to the Foundation’s 2019 Call for Concepts.All sections of this report were developed and/or drafted  by SJ team members, with International Program Director Adrian Coman playing a lead role.  Each component of  the report was reviewed and revised as needed by team members.  A list of discussion questions drafted by SJ Vice President Cindy Rizzo were addressed by the team at a series of meetings where staff reflected on these questions  as well as on each section of the report.  This led to  further revisions.SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | STRATEGY EVALUATION REPORT: 2018-2019 | AUGUST 20205PAGEKey Grantmaking DataIntegration of Faith and Trans Across All Goal AreasFaith GrantsInternational Portfolio 2018-2019Total Awarded $14,022,500 Total on Strategy $11,377,500U.S. Portfolio 2018-2019Total Awarded $15,413,000 Total on Strategy $12,275,000  2018 2019 2018-2019Amount % of all grants* Amount % of all grants* % of all grants*U.S. $1,735,000 21% $1,910,000 27% 24%International $1,216,239 18% $1,080,383 15% 16%Total $2,951,239 19% $2,990,383 21% 20%Trans-Focused Grants2018 2019 2018-2019Amount % of all grants* Amount % of all grants* % of all grants*U.S. $2,878,000 34% $750,000 11% 24%International $1,660,000 24% $1,027,500 14% 19%Total $4,538,000 30% $1,777,500 13% 21%*Includes transition grants*Includes transition grants2018 20182019 2019$4,227,500$2,645,000$7,150,000$0$5,425,000$2,988,000$6,850,000$150,000n U.S. on Strategy n U.S. Transitionn International Transitionn International on Strategy SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | STRATEGY EVALUATION REPORT: 2018-2019 | AUGUST 20206PAGEDistribution by GoalU.S. 2019 International 2019 Total 2019n Goal1      n Goal 2      n Goal 340%19%41%15%29%68% 53%17% 18%Intermediaries & Funding CollaborativesIn 2019, a total of 38 percent of all SJ funding was awarded to regranting organizations, either intermediaries where Arcus does not play a role in the ultimate grant awards, or funding collaboratives, where Arcus staff participate in the funding process. In the International portfolio in 2019, 36 percent  of its funding was awarded to intermediaries. In the U.S.  portfolio, 41 percent was awarded to funding collaboratives and intermediaries. The charts above present data for only 2019, the first full year of strategy implementation.  Omitting the transition year (2018) provides a more accurate picture of the distribution by goal area.  That said, given the holistic nature of our grant-ees’ work that is often not easily siloed into just one goal, the method used to collect this data involved analyzing the grantee’s self-reported goal alignment in their proposals and validating these with the program officer.  If multiple goals were indicated, the amount of the grant was evenly distrib-uted across those goals.  This straightforward method made the allocation process more efficient but resulted in  approximations in some cases where the emphasis of the work was not evenly balanced among Arcus’ SJ goals.SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | STRATEGY EVALUATION REPORT: 2018-2019 | AUGUST 20207PAGEKey Achievements and SetbacksThe following highlights key achievements and setbacks experienced in the program’s focal countries and regions during 2018-2019:East and Southern African South Africa is the only one of the SJ focal countries in these regions where hate violence data is collected by a government entity.
