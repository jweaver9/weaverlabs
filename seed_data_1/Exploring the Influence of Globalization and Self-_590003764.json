Over the past few decades, Vietnam has undergone significant changes, marked byits increasing interconnectedness with the global community. These changes have also broughtabout a shift in perceptions and advocacy toward the LGBTQ+ community. Also bringing alonga change in attitude towards the LGBTQ+ community in Vietnam is self-expression and fashion.Through drag or wearing gender-nonconforming attire, queer individuals are able to challengethe restrictive gender binary prevalent in Vietnamese society. Self-expression and fashion arealso critical in helping queer individuals form and assert their identities. Through in-depthinterviews with six members of the Vietnamese LGBTQ+ community residing in Hanoi, alongwith an online survey, this study will determine how the Vietnamese queer community situatesitself within the broader global community and the role of fashion and self-expression in shapingVietnamese queer identity-making. The results of this study reveal the foreign influence on theLGBTQ+ community in Vietnam. The spread of LGBTQ+ language and culture across the globehas played a large role in shaping the experiences and identities of queer individuals in Vietnam.Additionally, this study highlights the connection between fashion and self-expression withLGBTQ+ resistance, recognition, and empowerment. By using fashion and personal style as ameans of self-expression, Vietnamese queer individuals assert their identities and challengeconventional gender norms and stereotypes.Keywords: LGBTQ+, Self-Expression, Fashion, Identity, Globalization, QueerTyler 2Table of ContentsAbstract............................................................................................................................................1Acknowledgments............................................................................................................................3List of Figures..................................................................................................................................4Introduction......................................................................................................................................5Literature Review.............................................................................................................................6Philosophical Underpinnings.................................................................................................... 6Epistemology..............................................................................................................................8Modernization and Globalization..............................................................................................9Self-expression......................................................................................................................... 12Methodology..................................................................................................................................13Overview.................................................................................................................................. 13Limitations............................................................................................................................... 15Ethics........................................................................................................................................16Results and Discussion.................................................................................................................. 16Interviews.................................................................................................................................16Fashion and Self-Expression............................................................................................. 16Drag................................................................................................................................... 20Foreign Influences............................................................................................................. 24Language............................................................................................................................26Survey.......................................................................................................................................28Conclusion..................................................................................................................................... 31Future Findings........................................................................................................................33References......................................................................................................................................34Appendix........................................................................................................................................35General Interview Questions................................................................................................... 35Online Survey Questions..........................................................................................................36Tyler 3AcknowledgmentsThe success of my research project was made possible by the support and guidance of numerousindividuals.

We have our struggles, our desire, our niches, and our dreamsfor the future. We are just human, and we also suffer from human conditions too.”In May 2023, I had the opportunity to live in Hanoi and learn more about the lively LGBTQ+community in Vietnam’s capital city. While sipping coffee in a quiet cafe, I chatted with athoughtful 25-year-old man. As our conversation was ending, I asked him one final question,what his queer identity meant to him. His response left a lasting impression on me.Throughout my time in Hanoi, I had the privilege to talk to widely different LGBTQ+individuals who all shared their perspectives about their queer identities with me. The intentionof my paper is to explore two key areas within the Vietnamese queer community. First, it aims tounderstand the intricate relationship between self-expression and identity, focusing on the waysfashion is used among LGBTQ+ individuals. Additionally, my paper explores the dynamicrelationship between the Vietnamese LGBTQ+ community and the global LGBTQ+ movement,and the ways in which the increased interconnectedness of the world has impacted queerindividuals in Vietnam.In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the contemporary experiences ofthe LGBTQ+ community in Vietnam, it is important to examine the historical context that hasshaped perceptions about queer individuals. Various factors have contributed to theseperceptions, including the prevalence of religious philosophies such as Confucianism, whichhistorically upheld a binary model of gender and reinforced heteronormative values.Additionally, the spread of discriminatory discourse, particularly from the West, has also had animpact on the LGBTQ+ community in Vietnam. Further, Vietnam’s modernization after Dổi MớiTyler 6increased communication and the exchange of ideas within and outside Vietnam, influencingattitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community.Literature ReviewPhilosophical UnderpinningsPart of the attitudes toward sexual minorities in Vietnamese society can be explained by thecountry’s prominent religious philosophies like Confucianism and Taoism. Both of theseteachings originated in China and were brought to Vietnam during their rule over the country.Confucianism operates on a hierarchical system of superiors and subordinates and extends to allrelationships in society. Children are expected to obey their parents and wives are expected to besubordinate to their husbands within this hierarchy. Confucianism embodies highly collectivistand patriarchal values and has the Three Obediences and Four Virtues as guiding principles forwomen to behave virtuously and remain subordinate to the men in their families (Le et al., 449).Vietnamese society has been shaped by Confucian beliefs and the ideal woman is characterizedas modest, submissive to men, and subservient to traditional heterosexual marriage (Le et al.,450). Although Confucianism does not explicitly mention sex and sexuality in its teachings, thephilosophy creates an ideology of sex and sexual relations with a strong heteronormative beliefin traditional familial structure and gender roles. From the Confucian perspective, LGBTQ+individuals are portrayed as a failure to meet heteronormative familial expectations, as queerpeople place their desires over the collective ( Le et al., 452). This religious philosophy hasplayed a huge role in how queer Vietnamese people navigate their sexual and gender identities. A2017 study published by the Journal of Homosexuality shows that there is a significantcorrelation between LGBTQ+ individuals raised in a strong Confucius household andTyler 7internalized homonegativity and low self-esteem (Nguyen et al., 1626). Confucian valuescontinue to hold a significant influence on queer individuals today, shaping how they perceivethemselves and how others view them both within and outside of the community.Taoism’s ideology emphasizes harmony between individuals and between people andnature. Within the Taoist philosophy, Yin-Yang is a circle where Yin symbolizes the feminineside associated with soft, cool, calm, and passive whereas Yang signifies the masculine sideassociated with hard, hot, aggressive, and active (Le et al., 450). Yin-Yang is applied to allaspects of humanity and the restoration of harmony between Yin and Yang is often considered asolution for any misfortune. This binary thinking between male-female duality enforces anunderstanding that harmony is caused by a heterosexual relationship between a man and woman(Le et al., 452). No harmony can be found within same-sex partnerships, as homosexuality isplaced outside the realm of what is considered natural within this school of thought.Philosophical teachings such as Confucianism and Taoism have contributed to how same-sexrelationships and behaviors are perceived in Vietnamese society and in part explain the history ofwhy queer individuals have been considered socially unacceptable.Religious philosophies played a significant role in shaping the strict sexual dimorphismthat is rooted in Vietnamese society. An example of this is yin/yang, which symbolizes distinctgender attributes for females and males (Blanc 4). Like in many other places in the world, genderin Vietnam has historically been viewed as a binary concept. The status and roles of men andwomen are defined based on their anatomical differences, and as a result, there is no space for athird gender.Tyler 8EpistemologyIn the nineteenth century, two distinct sexological discourses circulated in Europe. The first wasan anatomical lexicon where the physiological anatomy determined someone’s sexual identity(Q. -A. R. Tran 37). Within this framework, gay men were classified on the lower end of thegender identity spectrum, alongside individuals whose feminine and masculine features wereindistinguishable, such as hermaphrodites and “masculine” women (Tran 12). The second was apsychiatric notion that became popular with the rise of medical institutions. The latter paradigmgave rise to the concept of “sexuality,” which attached a field of psychology and psychologicaldisposition to sexual identity (Q. -A. R. Tran 37). To this medical establishment, males who likedmales were called “inverts” and had an illness that was derived from their “effeminate featuresthat were mapped onto his physiology and psychology.” In this context, inverts were ‘really’women (Tran 12). Both of these paradigms spread from Europe to Vietnam. In the Vietnamesecontext, Dr. Richard Quang-Anh Tran used the term “gender-crossing” to describe bothparadigms, as Vietnamese sources often mixed and confused them (Tran 13). Although howthese sexological discourses were made popular in Vietnam is not fully understood, the country’stransition into a post-socialist market period offers a clue. These discourses were popularizedamong health experts through sex education manuals and print media during the 1990s (Tran 13).The economic and political reforms after the late 1980s enabled Vietnam to establish closer tieswith the global community, facilitating the exchange of ideas and ideologies across borders. AsVietnam opened up to the world, it became a hub for cross-cultural exchange and dialogue,allowing the country to tap into new sources of knowledge.The Dổi Mới reforms of 1986, also known as Renovation, was the VietnameseCommunist regime’s response to the severe hunger and struggling economy. These policiesTyler 9aimed to integrate Vietnam into the global economy, reduce bureaucracy, and limit theone-Party’s interference in various aspects of Vietnamese life (Tran 14). To justify the State’songoing authority after Renovation, one of the things it did was to mobilize movements topromote family values. The State executed the Cultured Family Program to target issues likehealth, population control, women’s behavior, and general social conduct (Tran 14). Through thisprogram, women were encouraged to return to traditional gender norms. By 1996, the Stateexecuted the Social Evils Campaign to manage “social evils” like drugs, prostitution, andpornography, that allegedly resulted from the free market (Tran 15). Along with the medicalsexological discourses, these two campaigns regulated the ideals of the body, gender, andsexuality, and affected the cultural construction of homosexuality in the Renovation period.Documents through gender-crossing discourse were widespread in late twentieth-centuryVietnam. The vocabulary words “gay” and “lesbian” were not popular (Tran 22). Instead,homosexual identities were defined through terms that centered on gender. For example, amanual by Dr. Đào Xuân Dũng published in 1995 called Sexual Education stated that “The malehomosexual has a feminine appearance and the female homosexual a masculine one revealingher sexual preferences even more clearly” (Tran 24). Theories like this were widespread in thisperiod, equating gender-crossing with homosexuality.Modernization and GlobalizationThe way in which the LGBTQ+ community situates itself in contemporary Vietnamese society isintimately intertwined with its positioning during the country’s shift towards modernization.Between 1986 and 2005, Vietnam experienced a period of modernization during thepost-socialist era, which began with the introduction of the Dổi Mới reforms. In Vietnam’sTyler 10context, “modernity” was marked by “rapid social, cultural, and economic modernization, aprofound departure from traditional practices, beliefs, and epistemologies.” Vietnam’s adoptionof a market-based economy allowed its integration into the global exchange of products,commodities, ideas, trends, and fashion (Tran 5). Before the Đổi Mới, Vietnam did not have anypolicies that targeted homosexuality (Phuong 423). The 2000 Marriage and Family Lawexplicitly forbade same-sex marriage and the National Assembly institutionalized a heterosexualcultural norm (Horton 962). Along with this, the Head of the Social Issues Committee of theNational Assembly declared “homosexuality is a disease and an evil thought” in 2004 (Phuong423). However, although homosexual behavior was not legally criminalized or prohibited priorto 2000, sexual minorities in Vietnam were and are still subjected to discrimination and violence.A 2015 study published by The Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment(iSEE) found that LGBT people “encounter negative comments and foul acts from colleagues,superiors and clients, as well as partners, at the rate of around 33% to almost 50%” (Huy et al.15). Further, rather than being recognized as a full member of society, individuals withnon-normative forms of sexuality are still silenced or portrayed as pathological (Horton 961).For a long time, LGBTQ+ people have been socially invisible and misrecognized inVietnamese society. However, Vietnam still has made significant strides toward LGBTQ+equality in the past decades. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, “non-government,” “civilsociety,” and international nongovernmental organizations started being introduced to stateagencies and society (Phuong 426). NGOs and other civil society groups have played asignificant role in transforming the perception of LGBTQ+ individuals in Vietnam since 2008. Anumber of Vietnamese organizations and groups, including iSEE, ICS, and It’s T Time werecreated and helped advance the LGBTQ+ movement through policy advocacy and socialTyler 11awareness (Phuong 428). In 2012, the Vietnamese LGBTQ+ movement shifted its focus topolicy advocacy, with organizations and leaders using empathy and investment in personalrelationships as tactics to achieve recognition and promote policy change for the community(Phuong 429). iSee invited state cadres from the Ministry of Justice and other governmentalagencies to serve as consultants for their research projects, which led to a shift in consultantviews from opposition to support for same-sex marriage (Phuong 430). This was a partialsuccess, as homosexuality was reclassified from a “social evil” in public online discussions onthe Government Web Portal on July 24, 2012 (Phuong 431). In 2014, the National Assemblyvoted to revise the Marriage and Family Law, removing the prohibition on same-sex marriagewithout actually recognizing it (Phuong 432). While not necessarily a defeat or victory for theLGBTQ+ movement in Vietnam, this action represented a lack of recognition for the community.Many of the LGBTQ+ organizations in Vietnam are funded heavily by internationalLGBTQ+ organizations from the West. This funding source may impact the VietnameseLGBTQ+ movement’s tactic for gaining recognition, as it is dependent on non-Vietnameseorganizations. Vietnamese LGBTQ+ activists face scrutiny over their motivations and inventionsand often need to navigate informal networks to seek advocacy opportunities (Phuong 426). Toachieve recognition, the movement has traditionally focused on identity and rights-based claims,which have been successful strategies globally. However, International GovernmentalOrganizations (IGOs) based mainly in the U.S. and Europe have institutionalized the globalLGBTQ+ human rights movement and painted a universal picture of LGBTQ+ rights throughdata and reports. The Euro-American NGO dominance in the movement has allowed them todictate the terms of the international LGBTQ+ agenda, from funding to transnational attention,creating a new political niche in the NGO world (Newton 263). This has led to a stratification ofTyler 12the Vietnamese LGBTQ+ community, where certain political projects receive more resourcesthan others. Further, western notions that distinguish gender and sexual orientations as separateconstructs may pose conflicts in Vietnam. Vietnamese NGO researchers who use “SOGI”(Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity) and \"LGBT\" to promote LGBTQ+ human rights inVietnamese media encounter difficulties in translating these new terminologies (Newton 271).This highlights the need for cultural sensitivity in the internationalization of LGBTQ+ rights.With the rise of modernization, new forms of connections within the LGBTQ+community emerged. The introduction of the Internet to Vietnam in 1997 gave rise to variousonline platforms, including Yahoo!, 360, blogs, and forums, which provided previouslyunavailable spaces for gay, lesbian, and transgender individuals to connect and engage with oneanother (Phuong 429). In 2010, a group of lesbians organized an LGBTQ+ cycling event via alesbian web forum (Newton 212). Following the event, the organizer shared photos and an articleon the forum, which was one of six online spaces for lesbians in Vietnam (Newton 213). This isanother instance where LGBTQ+ individuals were able to establish connections and formcommunity through the emergence of online platforms.Self-expressionWithin the LGBTQ+ community, self-expression is extremely important, with fashion andpersonal style serving as a way to authentically represent one’s identity. Transgender, non-binary,effeminate, and intersexual bodies all disrupt traditional norms of gender expression andchallenge societal expectations of masculinity and femininity. Through the stylization ofLGBTQ+ bodies, power relations are re-evaluated, challenging the hegemony of theheterosexual matrix and combating heteronormativity. This opens up opportunities forTyler 13organizations to embrace queerness and become more inclusive of diverse identities (Siqueira etal., 3). Self-expression can also be used as a form of resistance, as it challenges traditionalnotions of sexuality and gender and develops new ideas outside of mainstream thought. Oneform of resistance is reclaiming language, such as the term ‘queer,’ and using it as a new way ofthinking and living. Another is to deconstruct societal discourse and challenge conventionalideas of knowledge, leading to a shift in how society views queer individuals (Siqueira et al., 3).The LGBTQ+ community challenges traditional gender norms and introduces new perspectiveson gender. Drag serves as an example of this. Judith Butler notes in her book, Undoing Gender,that drag is a powerful tool for challenging societal constructs of gender, as it “not only makes usquestion what is real and what has to be, but by showing us how contemporary notions of realitycan be questioned, and new modes of reality instituted” (217-218). Drag performers presentthemselves in ways that are not confined to their assigned gender at birth and undo the genderbinary. Drag introduces viewers to alternative ways of conceptualizing gender and encouragesthem to consider the fluidity of what gender is.MethodologyOverviewMost of the research that I did took place in Hanoi from April 30th to May 9th, 2023. I thenrelocated to Ho Chi Minh City until May 18th, 2023. The information gathered in this researchstudy comes from in-depth interviews, an online survey, and secondary literature resources.From this, I was allowed to collect both qualitative and quantitative data, all of which supportedmy findings.Tyler 14I conducted a total of six semi-structured interviews with different individuals belongingto the LGBTQ+ community in Hanoi. I obtained both written and verbal consent to conductthese interviews and use the information found in my research paper. Because human memory isoften inaccurate, the interviews were recorded on an iPhone and were transcribed for furtheranalysis. Two of my interviewees opted to remain anonymous in their personal identities. Thosewho are anonymous still participated in and were critical to my study. All of the people Iinterviewed included in my data are in their twenties. I also interviewed a queer white dragperformer who moved to Hanoi from the United States to get a foreigner’s perspective on howthey related to the Vietnamese LGBTQ+ community. She is excluded from my data but will bekept for my analysis. The interviews are the qualitative portion of my data. My approach tofinding interviewees varied throughout my research process. I was connected to someone whoworked with LGBTQ+ rights from iSEE through SIT. However, the majority of the people Italked to I connected to myself. I used social media platforms to connect with Vietnameseindividuals who identified as queer. Additionally, I attended various queer events such as dragshows and movie nights, which I found online. I would approach attendees and exchange contactinformation for an interview. I also visited queer clubs and engaged in conversations withindividuals, exchanging contact details for later interviews.In addition to the interviews, I also created an online survey that mostly matched myinterview questions. I received a total of 15 responses to my survey. This quantified my data andhelped me gather more information in the short period of time I was able to do my research. Icreated the online survey through google forms and posted it on Vietnamese LGTBQ+ Facebookgroups and distributed it through word-of-mouth. The survey was completely anonymous, andthe recorded respondents are mostly from Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. Besides demographicTyler 15questions, I asked a total of 12 questions regarding their experiences being LGBTQ+. However, Iwill only be using five of the questions in my analysis, as the other questions are not as relevant.LimitationsThere were several limitations that I faced while conducting this independent research project.The primary challenge I faced was the language barrier, which sometimes hindered my ability tofully convey my ideas to respondents. Although all of the individuals I interviewed spokeEnglish, the nuances of communication can be lost due to differences in our native language.Also, because I only spoke with those within the LGBTQ+ community who spoke English, myresearch contains some biases as my data does not contain the experiences of those who onlyspeak Vietnamese.Another limitation I had was the restricted one-month timeframe for data collection. Iwas only able to conduct a limited number of interviews and obtain a modest amount of surveyresponses. While the data I gathered met the requirements of my research, more time would haveallowed me to gather a more extensive range of insights into the experiences of the LGBTQ+community.The last limitation I encountered was my sampling approach. To find individuals tointerview, I focused on those who were openly “out” and connected with people who went toqueer spaces or were involved with LGBTQ+ organizations. I conducted my survey online,which introduces potential biases to my sample. In an ideal scenario, a random samplingapproach would have provided more accurate and unbiased results.Tyler 16Despite these limitations, I was able to gather a sufficient amount of both quantitative andqualitative data. My research provides a unique perspective on the lives of the LGBTQ+community in urban Vietnam.EthicsThere were several steps that I took to ensure that my research study was conducted in an ethicalmanner. As my research focuses on the LGBTQ+ community, a sensitive group in Vietnam, Imade sure that my project was fully transparent to participants. Survey responses wereanonymous, and those I interviewed had the option to have their identities remain anonymous aswell. I have both verbal and written consent from those I interviewed. Throughout the interviewprocess, I made it clear that interviewees had the right to back out at any point or decline toanswer any questions that they were not comfortable with. I arranged all the interviews eithervirtually or at a location and time that was most convenient for them.Results and Discussion“I think queer for me is just a rejection of the norms. It is much more than an expression ofsexuality.”InterviewsFashion and Self-ExpressionEvery single person I interviewed relates fashion and self-expression to their queer identity.Quốc Anh, a twenty-five-year-old trans man working as the Team Leader of the Advocacy teamat It’s T Time, shared with me that he had never felt comfortable dressing as a stereotypical girl.Since he was three years old, he wanted to dress like a boy and has consistently done so. HeTyler 17purposefully chooses clothing that aligns with masculine gender norms and that helps him “pass”as a man in society (Nguyễn). Quốc Anh acknowledged that this pressure to conform to societalexpectations of what a “man” should look like highlights the impact of gender stereotypes onfashion choices. For trans individuals, clothing can serve as a way to validate and express theirgender identity. However, societal expectations can limit their choices and make it difficult to beperceived as their true gender. For example, if a trans man does not “pass,” they may facediscrimination and be perceived differently than a cisgender man who wears feminine clothing.Quốc Anh told me that he used to be concerned about other people’s judgment of the way hedressed, especially in a medical space. There, people could look at him more closely and thinkthat “maybe he is not a man” because his body didn’t conform to the gender standards associatedwith males. However, he no longer has this concern because he has taken hormones for sevenyears, and along with his clothing, he can physically “pass” as a man. Fashion is one of the manyways that people express their gender identity, and for Quốc Anh, wearing masculine clothinghelps him feel more authentic in his identity.Phong, the LGBTI Rights Program Manager at iSEE, shared his perspective on clothingas a form of self-expression. He believes that clothing is a powerful tool to convey whatsomeone wants to say to the world. Growing up as a man, Phong was taught to present himself asmore masculine. However, becoming more comfortable with his identity, Phong began to dressmore feminine. Working in advocacy, Phong also considers how dressing against gender normscan be used as a tool for showing resistance to the normative gender binary. He told me that he“loves to use clothing as a way to poke at the discomfort of straight people.” Once, in anadvocacy meeting with the Ministry of Health, Phong intentionally wore a formal black skirt toshow his feminine side. He stated, “The goal is simple: to get people to realize that expression isTyler 18just like that, it does not have anything to do with being queer or straight” (Vuong). In thisinstance, clothing was used as a tool for promoting understanding about the fluidity of femininityand masculinity and clothes don’t have to be associated with specific genders. Fashion cancommunicate meaning beyond the surface level of expression and can be used as another form ofadvocacy alongside policy briefs and presentations.Something to note is the difference between how Phong and Quốc Anh express theirgender identity. In her book, Undoing Gender, Judith Butler states that it is important “to tracethe moments where the binary system of gender is disputed and challenged, where the coherenceof the categories are put into question, and where the very social life of gender turns out to bemalleable and transformable” (216). As a cisman, Phong uses clothing as a tool of resistanceagainst societal gender norms. By wearing feminine clothing, he is able to subvert the norms ofthe rigid gender binary. There is a normative assumption in society that biological factors, likechromosomes, are the ultimate determinant of gender (Schilt et al. 50). Phong goes against thoseassumptions, refusing to fall into the pressures of conforming to the ideas of what a man shouldlook like. Quốc Anh was born in a body that did not align with his gender identity and hisclothing choices were a way of validating his male identity and pushing back against the societalassumption that associates gender to biological sex. Unlike Phong, as a transgender individual,Quốc Anh must navigate both societal gender classifications and the risks of not “passing.”When talking to a twenty-five-year-old gay man, he shared with me his perspective onthe rigid gender expectations surrounding clothing in Vietnam. He revealed that being queerdisrupted this societal norm and changed his views on dressing to express himself. In the past, heonly cared about the function of clothing. Recently, he started to value how his clothes made himfeel. He loves wearing colorful, floral, and nature-inspired clothing, which makes him feel aTyler 19sense of belonging (Anonymous). As he became more open and accepting of his sexuality, hefelt more liberated in his clothing choices and no longer felt confined by the expectations oftraditional male attire. This man’s clothing choices reflect his desire to break free from thesocietal norms and gender expectations associated with traditional male attire. As a gay man, hehas likely experienced prejudice because of his sexual orientation, but his fashion may be a wayto assert his identity in a society that may not always fully accept him for who he is. His clothingchoices are a way of rejecting the traditional masculine norms and breaking free from societalexpectations, which have historically limited the expression of queer identities.During my conversation with a female bisexual college student, I learned that she usedfashion as a tool to move across the spectrum of femininity and masculinity. Her apparel allowsher to switch between the realms of “masculinity” and “femininity.” She says that when shedresses more masculine–like wearing baggy pants, having many rings, and cutting her hairshort–she feels more visible to other queer individuals. It also changes the way she acts, sayingthat when she wears more masculine stuff she “becomes more of a bro and is like to people, hey,brother what’s up?” Other times, she likes dressing femininely, putting on makeup, and doing hernails (Anonymous, Interview 5). Through her experience, she highlights the impact of societalexpectations and stereotypes on fashion choices and how fashion can be used as a tool forself-expression and recognition.Clothing is highly gendered and can have a significant impact on an individual’s sense ofidentity. For example, the female college student uses clothing to navigate across the genderspectrum and hints at her queerness through nonverbal communication and self-expression.When she dresses in a more masculine style, it allows her to signal her identity to others andestablish connections with LGBTQ+ members, even if it reinforces the stereotype of masculineTyler 20women being perceived as lesbians. Similarly, for the twenty-five-year-old male, fashion is a toolfor exploring his queerness and pushing back against the cultural norms that assign gender toclothing. Style empowers queer individuals to challenge the notion that links gender andsexuality to clothing and accessories and gives them the opportunity to form connections increative ways. Apparel is a powerful way to disrupt the gender binary and foster greaterinclusivity in society.“Clothing and accessories are not just a function, but they are also a feeling of the freedom ofexpression that it brings us when we wear them. My friends say, when you wear your earrings towalk, it is like putting on your armor. It prepares you when you go outside to fight the war. I feelthe same way when I wear my clothes and accessories. I feel lifted up and empowered.”DragI first saw CumDumb-ling at a drag show in Hanoi hosted by Peach. He1 was the drag performerhosting the event that night, and I reached out to him via Instagram to ask him about his story.During the interview, he shared that his queer identity centers around creativity. According tohim, he has always felt the need to pursue something “bigger and more creative.” He becameinterested in drag when he started watching the Netflix show, Rupaul’s Drag Race. Beforewatching, he wondered why any gay man would dress like a woman, as gay people have to bemore masculine to hide being gay. However, after giving the show a chance, he fell in love withthe art form, describing it as a “whole new world” (D. A. Le).1 CumDumb-ling uses she/her pronouns while in drag, but he was not in drag when I interviewed him and goes byhe/him pronouns normally. I will be referring to CumDumb-ling using he/him pronouns throughout this paperbecause of this.Tyler 21During his time studying abroad in Australia in 2019, CumDumb-ling was furtherexposed to the world of drag and started practicing at home while watching Rupaul. Dragtransformed the way he perceived his gay identity. Growing up, CumDumb-ling always forcedhimself to be “some kind of homosexual,” presenting himself nicely and being more masculine.He then told me about the multiple stages he went through after being introduced to drag. Hefirst thought that to be a drag queen, one has to look the most womanly ever. Then he realizedthat you do not have to wear pads or wigs; in drag, you can do whatever you want (D. A. Le).Drag gave CumDumb-ling a creative outlet to explore and express his feminine side. Often, gaymen are inherently associated with femininity and viewed as “lesser than” because of theirattraction to the same gender. CumDumb-ling personally experienced this, which led him tobelieve that gay men had to conform to traditional masculine norms in order to be accepted bysociety. However, drag allowed CumDumb-ling to overcome the pressures to conform totraditional masculine norms as a way to overcompensate for his sexuality. Discovering dragallowed him to unlearn his belief that gay men have to be hypermasculine and gave him an outletto experiment with gender-crossing and femininity.Binary models of gender are still inherent in Vietnamese society. When CumDumb-lingperformed in drag at a straight bar, he received a tip from a Vietnamese man who assumedCumDumb-ling was a trans woman seeking gender reassignment surgery. This incident provesthe ongoing existence of the societal perception that males and females perform gender indistinct ways. However, drag performers challenge this binary system by blurring the linesbetween masculine and feminine characteristics through their embodiment and performance.Drag performers continually construct and deconstruct gender every time they “get into face”and “de-drag” (Guerrero 23). This process shows that gender does not have to be associated withTyler 22biological sex, and provides an opportunity for performers to push against societal conventionsand explore the fluidity of gender. Drag performers expose audiences to a wider range of genderexpression, prompting them to question contemporary and traditional gender norms.When CumDumb-ling was hosting the show at Peach, he was using English tocommunicate. During our interview, I asked CumDumb-ling why he chose to host the show inEnglish, and he explained that he usually hosts in Vietnamese. However, it is “harder to host inVietnamese because all of the jokes have to be understandable for both foreigners andVietnamese people” (D. A. Le). When we talked about the evolution of the drag scene in Hanoi,CumDumb-ling said that it has changed drastically over the past few years. The night he hostedat Peach, there were about 125 people there and the demographics consisted of both foreignersand Vietnamese individuals. This is a contrast to when CumDumb-ling attended his first dragperformance in Hanoi in 2019, where there were only around 50 individuals–with around 40being foreigners. He told me that even though drag has been around in Vietnam since the 2000s,not that many people knew what it was and the majority just thought it was cross-dressing forcomedic performance. This has changed a lot in recent years, and now he observes thatVietnamese individuals usually make up the majority of the audience, accounting for around 60to 70% of attendees (D. A. Le). Even though drag has been in Vietnam before event spaces likePeach, foreigners helped popularize Western drag. Originally, Western drag shows were mainlyattended by foreigners, but there has been a steady increase in Vietnamese attendees in recentyears. This has resulted in more Vietnamese performers, like CumDumb-ling, hosting shows andgiving him a platform for both foreign and Vietnamese people.CumDumb-ling believes that the West has had a significant influence on the popularity ofdrag in Vietnam and that foreign influence has impacted the formation of the drag scene inTyler 23Hanoi. Peach was established by an Irish drag queen named Lavender, alongside her friendDavid, and was later handed over to two American performers and a Vietnamese artist. To gainfurther insight into the foreigner’s influence and experience within the Vietnamese LGBTQ+drag scene, I interviewed one of the American organizers Peach was handed to, Annietagonist.She told me that initially, the show attracted mainly foreigners. However, the situation changedafter the COVID pandemic, and more Vietnamese individuals started to attend. The show nowfeatures a diverse group of hosts, and they welcomed more Vietnamese hosts and hosts whospeak Vietnamese in response to the changing demographic of the audience (Pressley). Westernculture influenced the evolution of the drag scene in Hanoi and foreign-led drag shows havechanged to become a more inclusive community that adapted to the changing demographic of itsaudience.In addition to their local connections, Peach also has ties overseas. Every year, Peachhosts a fundraiser event where they donate all of their profits to a charity or an LGBTQ+organization either in Vietnam or abroad. More recently, they have started to contribute apercentage of their profits every month to a Vietnamese organization, and they sometimesconduct an event dedicated solely to raising funds for a charitable cause. They have also beeninvited to perform at several international festivals, including Wonderfruit in Thailand (Pressley).Peach’s participation in international events and international philanthropy highlights their globalconnections and impact within the local and international LGBTQ+ communities.During conversations with Annietagonist and CumDumb-ling, I gained insight into theinfluence of the foreign community on the Hanoi drag scene. Annietagonist's connection with theVietnamese queer community was established after she attended a Rupaul's Drag Race viewingparty, where she witnessed local performers and saw an opportunity for her unique style of dragTyler 24as both a queen and a king. The popularity of the US-based show Rupaul's Drag Race has playeda significant role in promoting drag culture globally, and it also introduced CumDumb-ling to theworld of drag. This exposure led him to attend foreigner-led drag shows, and subsequently, hecollaborated with two Vietnamese and two South African individuals to establish Wet Market, adrag event space created one year after Peach. The foreign community's cultural and practicalcontributions have significantly impacted the drag community in Vietnam by popularizing itthrough shows like Rupaul and the creation of queer event spaces. However, it is crucial torecognize that drag has been present in Vietnam much longer, but the recognition andappreciation for those performers were relatively low in comparison to Western drag culture.Solely crediting foreigners for introducing drag to Vietnam undermines the decades-long workand influence that Vietnamese drag performers had in building platforms that have long resistedthe gender binary.“I am always very dynamic and changing all the time, but also at the same time my personalityis very quiet, and I am very shy. I don’t really know how to talk to people. I am pretty much anintrovert. But when I get on the stage like–I don’t know what clicks–it’s just a complete switch.”Foreign InfluencesPhong is a worker at iSEE, a Vietnamese NGO that champions LGBTQ+ issues from a humanrights lens. iSEE is an advocacy organization that produces original research by Vietnamesepeople on Vietnamese issues. Their LGBTQ+ program uses the research to educate the public oncontemporary LGBTQ+ issues as well as for policy and public advocacy. They are largelyfunded by foreign aid, which Phong believes has contributed to the decline in the discussion ofTyler 25LGBTQ+ issues in Vietnam in the past few decades. Most of the NGOs in the country do notreceive government aid and are heavily reliant on foreign aid. There is a large imbalance in howinternational LGBTQ+ funding is distributed, with the largest funding going to North America,Europe, and Africa. Asia only receives a comparably smaller portion. The money that does go toAsia mostly goes to countries that have criminalization laws towards LGBTQ+ people, whichVietnam does not have. Further, the effects of receiving the majority of funding internationallycan put advocacy workers in complicated positions, having to answer questions like “Where isyour money coming from?” or “Who are you working for?” (Vuong). There are many challengesin advocating for LGBTQ+ issues in Vietnam when being heavily reliant on foreign aid. Becauseof the unequal distribution of international funding for LGBTQ+ issues that Vietnam receives,NGO influence may not be as influential when it comes to changing policies. Further,international aid also puts advocacy workers in complicated situations because of the mistrust inoutside countries.Quốc Anh, who works at the community organization It’s T Time, a Vietnameseorganization working to advance trans rights, said that the majority of their funding also comesfrom abroad (Nguyễn). He also told me that it is difficult to advocate for gender affirmation andidentity laws because Vietnam is a developing country. The government thinks that LGBTQproblems are not as precedent as other matters like the economy. Although Vietnam isprogressive on LGBTQ+ issues compared to many other countries in Asia, Vietnamese LGBTQ+organizations still must navigate the complexities of receiving foreign aid while also advocatingfor human rights policies that aren’t viewed as important as economic policies.In August 2022, Quốc Anh told me about a dialogue event It’s T Time helped organize tospread awareness of transgender issues and to discuss the drafting of the Gender AffirmationTyler 26Law (GAL) in Vietnam (Nguyễn). Among those who spoke was Alba Rueda, Argentina’sSpecial Envoy for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. She is openly transgender and hasmany years of experience in formulating and implementing the 2012 Gender Identity Law inArgentina (Thao). She brought a new perspective that required attention and prioritization to thedraft GAL in Vietnam. This event shows the powerful solidarity that the LGBTQ+ communityhas globally. Argentina is a developing country that passed one of the most progressive laws inthe world on transgender people’s rights, and their insight is important in helping to guide othercountries in passing LGTBQ+ rights legislation. The success of Argentina's Gender Identity Lawproves that other developing countries like Vietnam can also prioritize human rights laws andshows the impact of the fight for trans activists globally.LanguageThroughout my interviews, several individuals shared with me how the English language and theglobalization of LGBTQ+ terminology have assisted with their ability to express their queeridentity. Quốc Anh, for instance, told me that when he was younger, he did not know themeaning of transgender (Nguyễn). At the time, he told me that the Vietnamese internetconsidered transgender in a medical context. When he looked at how it was defined in English,he realized that he was trans. Phong revealed that when he was younger, he did not identify asqueer and instead defined himself solely as gay. He attributed this to the lack of availablelanguage to categorize LGBTQ+ identities, along with his limited English proficiency at thetime. As he improved his language skills, he developed the tools to identify himself usingvarious LGBTQ+ terminology, both in English and Vietnamese (Vuong). Similarly, Huy, anonbinary nineteen-year-old, shared how the English vocabulary has helped Vietnamese queerTyler 27individuals identify themselves, especially given that many of the older Vietnamese termsrelating to queerness were historically discriminatory. According to Huy, many individuals use“homosexual” to describe themselves instead of “gay” because the latter has a negativeconnotation in Vietnamese culture and has not been fully reclaimed yet (Pham). Theglobalization of LGBTQ+ English terminology has helped Vietnamese queer people expresstheir identities when some Vietnamese terms still hold negative connotations or do not exist todescribe certain queer identities.Vietnamese queer individuals are reclaiming LGBTQ+ terminology by giving them amore positive lighthearted tone. An example is the word “pê-đê” (or “bê-đê”), which originatedfrom the French and Americans (Nguyễn). Historically, “pê-đê” referred to the “unnatural”relationship between a man and a boy or another man (Tran 16). This term was associated withgender inversion, and bisexuality was likened to hermaphroditism (Tran 17). However, theVietnamese LGBTQ+ community has taken back control of this term and it is now consideredacceptable for community members to refer to each other as “pê-đê” (Nguyễn). I came across anInstagram handle called “bedebynight,” run by a drag queen in Hanoi. The bio states that thepage was “The best place to update Drag Show events in the Capital of bedes for bedes andnon-bedes.” In this context, “bê-đê” or “pê-đê” has been reclaimed by the drag community.Reclaiming language is a common form of resistance against the discrimination thatmarginalized groups have experienced throughout history. A word that was once used to belittlegay men and reduce their identity to “he” and “she” is now being used as a source of irony,empowerment, and pride within the drag community. This also shows that language has thepower to change over time and the importance of marginalized communities taking control oftheir own narratives by reclaiming historically discriminatory terminology.Tyler 28There are consequences to using the English language and consuming foreign media, onebeing undermining Vietnamese culture. When it comes to this, Phong believes that it is importantto appreciate all of the good things that Vietnam has to offer, such as ideas of collectivism andstrong familial bonds (Vuong). If people do not do this, they may overlook the valuable aspectsof what Vietnam has to offer. Growing up queer in Vietnam and being exposed to Western mediahas taught Phong that Western words have specific meanings, and it is a process to unpack themessages that the media is telling him. There are alternatives to Western media, and Vietnam hasa lot of good media with unique outlooks on sexuality (Vuong). When talking to anotherinterviewee, he shared similar thoughts on the Western language. He works with youth in theLGBTQ+ community in Hanoi, and they start learning Western language to identify themselves.He sees that more people favor Western culture and that their roots are left behind them. Therewas even a period in his life when he wanted to leave his Vietnamese culture, but he changed hisviews. He now wants to explore the old language about sexuality and about the queer communityand learn more about it (Anonymous). Although the English vocabulary has helped give manyVietnamese queer individuals a way to articulate their identity, the Vietnamese language isconstantly changing and evolving, giving the LGBTQ+ community more ways to expressthemselves.SurveyFor the demographics of my survey, 60% currently live in Ho Chi Minh City, 33.3% live inHanoi, and 6.7% live in Hue. There were a diverse range of sexualities, as 40% identified as gay,20% identified as demisexual, 13.3% identified as lesbian and asexual, and the rest of therespondents identified as queer or bisexual. For gender identity, 53.3% identified as a cis male,Tyler 2926.6% identified as a cis female, and the rest identified as nonbinary or questioning. Themajority of the respondents were aged 17-27, however, there were two respondents who wereolder than 35.The following graphs show the connection between being queer and self-expression andfashion. When asked about the extent one’s queer identity influences one’s fashion and stylefrom 1 being no influence to 10 being the most influential, the majority of survey respondentssaid that their queer identity influences their style. As shown in Figure 1, 73.4% of respondentsanswered greater than five, meaning that they strongly believed that their queer identityinfluenced their fashion choices.When the survey asked about the extent to which individuals wanted to convey specificcharacteristics or personalities through their clothing choices, 73.4% of the participantsresponded with a rating greater than five, indicating a strong desire to express themselvesthrough their attire.Tyler 30An overwhelming majority (93.3%) of respondents strongly noticed the changes in the waysLGBTQ+ individuals express themselves through fashion and style in Vietnam in the past fewyears. This could indicate that LGBTQ+ individuals are becoming more comfortable withexpressing their identity through their clothing choices and fashion preferences in public. Thisshift may be because of the changing attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community in Vietnam,with society becoming more inclusive and accepting of queer individuals.Figure 4 shows that 93.3% of the respondents strongly believe that the foreign communityinfluenced the Vietnamese queer community.Tyler 31Figure 5 shows that 86.7% of respondents strongly believe that the English vocabulary helpedexpress their identity and sexuality. This shows that the English language had a strong influenceon how LGBTQ+ people discover and articulate their identity.Contextualizing the survey answers with the interviews shows gives a more in-depth analysis ofthe how and why. For example, ways in which the foreign community has influenced theVietnamese queer community are through international donations to LGBTQ+ nonprofits orthrough the introduction of Western drag from shows like Rupaul or foreigner-organized dragevents. Further, the survey reveals that a significant number of LGBTQ+ individuals connecttheir queer identity with what they wear and express a desire to showcase their queer identitythrough personal style.ConclusionThe results of this study provide more information on how the Vietnamese LGBTQ+ communityis connected to the global community as well as how fashion and self-expression are tied toqueer identity. As Vietnam became more interconnected with the rest of the world, its LGBTQ+community found new ways of expressing themselves through language and culture. Many queerindividuals interviewed and surveyed noted that English LGBTQ+ terms helped them betterTyler 32understand and articulate their identity. However, queer people also reclaimed certainVietnamese terminology and took control over previously discriminatory narratives associatedwith those words. The growing popularity of Western media and shows like Rupaul’s Drag Raceshifted perceptions of LGBTQ+ identities in Vietnam within and outside of the queercommunity. Further, international LGBTQ+ organizations and foreign activists also played a rolein influencing the push for LGBTQ+ rights in Vietnam through funding and dialogue. However,more tangible change can be made if the Vietnamese government allocates funding to theorganizations, as people working there would not have to face questions about their intentionsand would also get more resources to promote their agenda.Different identities within the LGBTQ+ umbrella express the unique ways in whichfashion has contributed to their ability to defy the rigid gender binary, connect with other queerpeople, and discover new ways to perceive their identity. Clothing may just be fabric threadedtogether, but attached to it are powerful meanings, emotions, and ideas that reflect the wearer’sself-expression. It can help people feel more connected to their gender and sexuality, provide away to explore the nuances of masculinity and femininity, allow individuals to transcendtraditional gender norms, and so much more. Fashion is a tool that individuals can use to breakfree of the limiting labels imposed by society and express the colorful spectrum of humanity. Bypresenting ourselves to the world in ways that feel authentic and true, we can communicate whowe are, who we want to be, and what we stand for.Future FindingsThis research paper was only an introduction to the potential ways globalization andself-expression have influenced the Vietnamese LGBTQ+ community. If given more time, ITyler 33would have liked to conduct more interviews in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, as well asgather more survey results from both cities. There were only 15 survey responses, and thissample size is too small to draw accurate conclusions. Originally, I planned on interviewingpeople from both Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. Even though I was able to gather survey resultsfrom both cities, I only had time to interview people living in Hanoi.The survey results show thatthere are similarities between the LGBTQ+ community in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, but eachcity still has its own unique culture that impacts the experiences of the queer community thatlives there.The LGBTQ+ community is very broad, and interviewing more people would haveallowed me to narrow down the unique ways in which different individuals use fashion toexpress themselves. I would have liked to explore what the Vietnamese drag community was likebefore the introduction of Western drag and research the influence of those who have beenperforming drag since the early 2000s. I would have also delved into the potential side effectsthat foreigners may have had on the already existing drag community in Vietnam. Further,interviewing queer people who only speak Vietnamese would give a more complete picture ofunderstanding how non-English speakers express their gender and sexuality using VietnameseLGBTQ+-related vocabulary. Incorporating these elements would be more interesting to buildupon in the future of this research area.ReferencesAnonymous. Interview 2 [Personal Interview] Minh-Thy Tyler. 28 April 2023.Anonymous.

    "abstract": "The LGBTQ+ community is estimated to make up around 9% to 11% of Vietnam’s total population. Over the past few decades, Vietnam has undergone significant changes, marked by its increasing interconnectedness with the global community. These changes have also brought about a shift in perceptions and advocacy toward the LGBTQ+ community. Also bringing along a change in attitude towards the LGBTQ+ community in Vietnam is self-expression and fashion. Through drag or wearing gender-nonconforming attire, queer individuals are able to challenge the restrictive gender binary prevalent in Vietnamese society. Self-expression and fashion are also critical in helping queer individuals form and assert their identities. Through in-depth interviews with six members of the Vietnamese LGBTQ+ community residing in Hanoi, along with an online survey, this study will determine how the Vietnamese queer community situates itself within the broader global community and the role of fashion and self-expression in shaping Vietnamese queer identity-making. The results of this study reveal the foreign influence on the LGBTQ+ community in Vietnam. The spread of LGBTQ+ language and culture across the globe has played a large role in shaping the experiences and identities of queer individuals in Vietnam. Additionally, this study highlights the connection between fashion and self-expression with LGBTQ+ resistance, recognition, and empowerment. By using fashion and personal style as a means of self-expression, Vietnamese queer individuals assert their identities and challenge conventional gender norms and stereotypes",
