Kaufman, PhD1,2,and Laura Baams, PhD3AbstractResearch describes several sexual and gender identity-based micro-aggressions that sexual and gender minority (SGM) people might experience.We aimed to examine the occurrence of different sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions among SGM youth and to identify differences bysexual and gender identity, and sex assigned at birth. Open-ended questionsabout daily experiences were coded for 16 types of sexual and genderidentity-based microaggressions in two daily diary studies among Dutch SGMyouth (Study 1: N = 90, M age = 17.64 SD = 1.78; Study 2: N = 393, M age =18.36 SD = 2.65). Several types of microaggressions were identified, and therewas sizable variability in the reported frequency.

Overall, this study provides empirical support using mixedqualitative and quantitative methods for theorized typologies of micro-aggressions among Dutch SGM youth.Keywordsaexual and gender minority youth, icroaggressions, sexual identity, genderidentity, sex at birthSexual and gender minority (SGM) youth face stigma related to their sexualand gender identity (Meyer, 2003; Testa et al., 2015). In their day-to-day lives,this stigma can manifest in the form of subtle mistreatments, also referred to assexual and gender identity-based microaggressions. Microaggressions,originally studied among racial/ethnic minority groups (Pierce et al., 1977),are understood as “brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or en-vironmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that commu-nicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults” (Sue et al., 2007,273). Studies have described microaggressions that may be unique to SGMpeople, referred to as sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions, andshows that these microaggressions are associated with poorer mental health(Kaufman et al., 2017; Lui & Quezada, 2019). However, it is unclear whattypes of microaggressions SGM youth experience and whether some SGMsubgroups are at risk of experiencing different types of microaggressions. Anoverview of commonly experienced microaggressions and the occurrence ofmicroaggressions in a larger quantitative framework will improve our un-derstanding of adverse experiences among SGM youth and enable us to tailorprevention and intervention efforts. With this study, we aimed to identify towhat extent SGM youth experienced previously described types of micro-aggressions. Further, we aimed to investigate differences by sexual and genderidentity, and sex assigned at birth in the occurrence of microaggressions.Sexual and Gender Identity-Based MicroaggressionsMicroaggressions can take the form of microassaults, microinsults, andmicroinvalidations (Sue et al., 2007). Microassaults are described as con-scious attitudes or beliefs communicated to marginalized groups through2 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 0(0Kiekens et al. NP21295environmental cues, verbalizations, or behaviors. These messages can besubtle or explicit and are closely related to traditional discrimination. Incontrast, microinsults are interpersonal or environmental messages that areunintentional, but they convey stereotypes, rudeness, and insensitivity. Last,microinvalidations are understood as messages or environmental cues thatinvalidate the experiences of a marginalized group. These messages areconsidered most covert and insidious as they directly invalidate people’sexperiences (Sue et al., 2007).Regardless of the form of microaggressions, several types of sexual genderidentity-based microaggressions have been proposed (Nadal et al., 2010; Sue,2010). Initially, Sue (2010) described a list of sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions, and Nadal and colleagues (2010) proposed a morecomprehensive list of sexual and gender identity-based microaggression types(see Table 1). Empirical qualitative research has shown the occurrence ofsome of these sexual and gender identity-based microaggression types andidentified additional types as well. For example, a surface level of acceptanceonly when one is not involved in a relationship (undersexualization, Platt &Lenzen, 2013) and hurtful jokes (microaggression as humor, Platt & Lenzen,2013). Further, additional types of microaggressions include non-physicalassaultive experiences (threatening behaviors, Nadal et al., 2011), an ever-present threat of verbal harassment or physical violence (physical threat orharassment, Nadal et al., 2012), entitlement by others to objectify one’s body(denial of body privacy, Nadal et al., 2012), disapproval by family in amicroaggressive manner (familial microaggressions, Nadal et al., 2012), thepresence of environmental or systematic microaggressions (systematic mi-croaggressions, Nadal et al., 2012), and the questioning or undermining ofone’s sexual or gender identity by others (invalidation of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgender, and queer [LGBTQ] identity, Munro et al., 2019).Taken together, empirical research has shown the occurrence of these typesof sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions and identified addi-tional ones (Munro et al., 2019; Nadal et al., 2011, 2012; Platt & Lenzen,2013). However, research into the occurrence of all these microaggressions islimited, especially with regard to the additional types of microaggressions. Bynot examining these microaggressions in their entirety, a comprehensiveunderstanding of SGM youth’s experiences is obstructed.Studying the occurrence of sexual and gender identity-based micro-aggressions among SGM youth is especially relevant because this is the ageperiod during which sexual and gender identity develop (Bilodeau & Renn,2005). For SGM youth, it is therefore important to, among others, overcomeinternalized stigmatic messages (Bilodeau & Renn, 2005). Considering thatmicroaggressions communicate daily hostile, derogatory, or negative slightsand insults (Sue et al., 2007), they can negatively affect identity developmentamong SGM youth and ultimately their health (Mallory et al., 2021).l. 3NP21296 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 37(21-22)Table1.DescriptionandExampleofSexualandGenderIdentity-BasedMicroaggressionTypes,NumberandPercentageofParticipantsthatReportedaMicroaggression,andtheTotalNumberaMicroaggressionwasReported.SexualandGenderIdentity-BasedMicroaggressionTypesDescriptionExamplefromDataStudy1a(N=90)Study1a(N=90)N(%)ParticipantsReportingaMicroaggressionTimesMicroaggressionwasReportedN(%)ParticipantsReportingaMicroaggressionTimesMicroaggressionwasReportedDiscomfort/disapprovaloftheLGBTQexperience(Nadaletal.,2010)ThetreatmentofSGMpeoplewithdisrespectorcondemnationLastFriday,ateachersaidthathehateslesbians.22(24)2465(17)84Useofheterosexistortransphobicterminology(Nadaletal.,2010)UseofheterosexistlanguagetodegradeSGMpeopleSomeoneIdidn’tknowcalledsomething“gay”ataparty.48(53)7545(12)61InvalidationofLGBTQidentity(Munroetal.,2019)TheunderminingandquestioningofSGMidentitiesAtschool,peoplesaidthatbeinggayisfake,andpeopleonlyidentifyasgaytogetattention.10(11)1132(8)40Microaggressionsashumor(Platt&Lenzen,2013)ThecommunicationofamicroaggressionasajokeHearingtheword“gay”beingusedasajoke.19(21)2729(7)42(continued)4 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 0(0Kiekens et al.

This heterogeneity might berooted in youth’s unique experiences with a specific sexual or gender identity(Meyer, 2003; Testa et al., 2015). For example, bisexual people may expe-rience different types of microaggressions than lesbian and gay people (Sarno& Wright, 2013), which may stem from biphobia from heterosexual andsexual minority communities (Huffaker & Kwon, 2016). There may also bedifferences by sex assigned at birth in the experience of microaggressions.This can manifest in daily indignities that cisgender women experience moreoften than cisgender men (Lewis, 2017; Swim et al., 2001), leading to sex-based differences in the occurrence of microaggressions (Nadal et al., 2011).Also, the level of acceptance of minority groups may lead to specific types ofmicroaggressions. For example, among SGM groups, transgender peopleexperience the highest levels of prejudice and stigma compared to cisgendersexual minority people (Martı́n-Castillo et al., 2020; Su et al., 2016). Thedifferences in acceptance could result in different degrees of severity anddifferent types of microaggressions. Despite some preliminary studies thatexplored group-based differences (Nadal et al., 2016), there is currently littleresearch examining a comprehensive set of microaggressions and group-based differences therein.The Present StudyThe present study has two aims. First, to examine whether SGM youth reportsexual and gender identity-based microaggressions that were identified inprevious studies (Munro et al., 2019; Nadal et al., 2010, 2011, 2012; Platt &Lenzen, 2013). Second, to investigate differences in the experience of mi-croaggressions by sexual and gender identity, and sex assigned at birth. Weutilized data from two samples of Dutch SGM youth. Data from the first studywere used to examine which sexual and gender identity-based micro-aggressions SGM youth reported and in the second study, we were addi-tionally able to study differences by sexual and gender identity, and sexassigned at birth.Study 1MethodProcedure. Data came from a larger research project on the occurrence andcorrelates of sexual and gender identity-based microaggression experiencesamong Dutch sexual minority youth (Baams et al., 2018; Kaufman et al.,10 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 0(0Kiekens et al. NP213032017). Participants were recruited through advertisements on websites andsocial media from several LGBT community-based organizations throughoutthe Netherlands in 2015. Participants were asked to complete an online surveyand were entered into a raffle to receive a €5 gift card for their participation.After completing a baseline questionnaire, participants were asked to par-ticipate in an 8-day daily diary study. They were informed that their par-ticipation was confidential and voluntary. Informed consent was obtainedfrom all participants included in the study. Participants had the opportunity toparticipate anonymously, end the questionnaire at any time, and skip anyquestion. Approval of all procedures was granted by the Ethics Committee ofthe Social and Behavioural Sciences Faculty at Utrecht University.Using data from a daily diary study has the advantage that participantsreflect on their experiences more momentarily. That is, in most surveysparticipants are asked about their past experiences with, for instance, mi-croaggressions. However, people might have difficulties reconstructing theseexperiences (Larson & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014), especially when these arerelated to discrimination (Sechrist et al., 1998). Using diary data overcomesthis shortcoming because youth are asked about their experiences on a dailybasis.ParticipantsIn total, N = 364 youth participated in the research project. For this study, datafrom participants were excluded if they were not between 16 and 22 years old(n = 94), had a missing value on sexual identity, sex assigned at birth, genderidentity, identified as cisgender and heterosexual (n = 65), and if they did notparticipate in the 8-day daily diary study (n = 115), resulting in a final analyticsample of N = 90.The sample was diverse concerning sexual identity, with 33 (37%) par-ticipants identifying as lesbian, 22 (24%) as gay, 28 (31%) as bisexual, 2 (2%)as queer, and 5 (6%) with another sexual minority identity. In total, 66 (73%)were assigned female and 24 (27%) were assigned male at birth. Concerninggender identity, 80 (89%) identified as cisgender and 10 (11%) as a genderminority (i.e., participants gender identity was not concordant with their sexassigned at birth). Mean age was 17.64 (SD = 1.78), 70 (78%) lived with theirparents, and 8 (9%) participants did not identify as Dutch but had a migrationbackground from, for instance, Morocco or Turkey. Last, 46 (51%) were inhigh school, 10 (11%) in vocational education, 25 (28%) attended (applied)university, and 3 (3%) did not attend school anymore at the time of the study.MeasuresMicroaggressions. Participants were presented with an open-ended questionthat was developed for this study together with experts in the field “Manyl. 11NP21304 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 37(21-22)people experience situations in which something is said about one’s sexualorientation. For example, a joke, an unexpected comment, or the use of acertain word. These remarks can, but do not have to, have bad intentions. Wewonder if you had such an experience today, what happened, how you felt, andhow you responded. We would like to hear anything you want to share!Sometimes these experiences cause feelings of shame, anger, or sadness. Andsometimes these remarks do not really stand out, but they still leave you withan uneasy feeling.” If participants did not have such an experience, they couldskip this question. On the first day of the daily diary study, participants couldalso describe experiences in the past year. Two coders independently codedthe answers to this open-ended question for 16 types of sexual and genderidentity-based microaggressions that were identified from the literature (seeTable 1). Thus, we took a deductive approach to data coding: codes weretheoretically driven and a codebook was created prior to analyzing the data(Crabtree & Miller, 1999). After coding the open-ended questions, the twocoders compared their codes. When different codes were used, coders woulddiscuss until consensus was reached. One diary entry could be coded asmultiple types of microaggressions. Some entries to the open-ended questionsdid not describe microaggressions, and others were not described clearlyenough to code as a microaggression type. Neither of these entries wereincluded in the analyses (n = 48).Analytic Strategy. Because of the small sample size, we only assessed howmany participants reported a specific sexual and gender identity-based mi-croaggression type across all days of the study to validate existing micro-aggression types described in the literature.ResultsTable 1 presents the number and percentage of participants who reported asexual and gender identity-based microaggression and the frequency a mi-croaggression was reported by all participants. The mean number of days thatparticipants completed a diary entry was 4.64 (SD = 2.34) out of 8 days. Intotal, 79 (88%) of all participants reported at least one sexual and genderidentity-based microaggression. The mean number of microaggressions re-ported during the study was 2.58 (SD = 2.09).Most microaggression types were reported by at least one participant. Thethree microaggression types that were reported by most participants describedexperiences where heterosexist/transphobic language was used to degradeparticipants (use of heterosexist or transphobic terminology, reported by 53%of all participants), experiences in which it was assumed that all SGM peopleare similar/have similar experiences (assumption of universal LGBTQ ex-perience, reported by 28% of all participants), and experiences in which12 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 0(0Kiekens et al.

None of the participants reported experiences of a surface levelof acceptance only when one is not involved in a relationship (under-sexualization) or non-physical assault (threatening behaviors).ConclusionAlmost all sexual and gender identity-based microaggression types werereported in an 8-day period. More than half of SGM youth experiencedheterosexist or transphobic terminology. In contrast, none of the participantsexperienced undersexualization or threatening behaviors. Thus, SGM youthin this sample reported most of the sexual and gender identity-based mi-croaggressions described by previous studies, but there was large variability inhow many participants reported specific microaggression types.Study 2In Study 1, we were only able to examine what sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions SGM youth reported in a relatively small sample ofSGM youth. In Study 2, we examine what sexual and gender identity-basedmicroaggressions SGM youth report in a larger sample, which strengthens ourfindings. Additionally, the larger sample additionally makes it possible toexplore differences by sexual and gender identity, and sex assigned at birth.MethodProcedure. Data came from a 14-day daily diary study. Participants wererecruited through Facebook and Instagram advertisements that ran fromOctober to December 2019. Advertisements were targeted at 16–25-year-oldyouth that lived in the Netherlands, spoke Dutch, and had sexual and genderidentity-related interests (i.e., Gay Pride Parade). For each completed dailysurvey, participants received approximately €1.79, which could amount to €25in gift cards. Participants were informed that their participation was confi-dential and voluntary, and all participants provided informed consent. On thefirst day of the study, participants completed a baseline survey and imme-diately after that the first daily diary survey. The Ethics Committee of thethe Pedagogy and Educational Sciences Department at the University ofGroningen approved the study’s procedure.Participants. The sample comprised of N = 409 participants. Data fromparticipants who completed the consent form but did not complete a question(n = 13) or a daily survey (n = 3) were excluded, resulting in a sample of N =14 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 0(0Kiekens et al. NP21307393. There was no missing data for sexual or gender identity, and sex assignedat birth, and no participants identified as cisgender and heterosexual. Thesample was diverse in terms of sexual identity, with 65 (17%) of participantsidentifying as lesbian, 107 (27%) as gay, 116 (30%) as bisexual, 29 (7%) asqueer, 39 (10%) as pansexual, 5 (1%) as heterosexual, 17 (4%) did not knowtheir sexual identity, and 15 (4%) had a different minority sexual identity(write-in options). For sex assigned at birth, 252 (64%) were assigned femaleand 141 (36%) were assigned male at birth. In total, 127 (32%) identified ascisgender men, 182 (46%) as cisgender women, 22 (6)% as transgender men,3 (1%) as transgender women, 15 (4%) as non-binary, 8 (2%) as genderqueer,4 (1%) as genderfluid, 3 (1)% had a different gender identity, and 29 (7)% didnot know their gender identity. Mean age was 18.36 (SD = 2.65) and 296(75%) lived with their parents. Of all participants, 53 (13%) had a migrationbackground from, for instance, Morocco, Surname, or the Antilles. Last, 130(33%) were in high school, 75 (19%) in vocational education, 107 (27%)attended (applied) university, and 76 (19%) did not attend school anymore atthe time of the study.MeasuresMicroaggressions. Experiences with sexual and gender identity-based mi-croaggressions were assessed by asking participants, “Since filling in theprevious daily survey (on the first day: ‘In the past 24 hours’), did you have anegative experience related to your sexual orientation or gender identity? Forexample, annoying jokes, inappropriate questions, being excluded, or beingcalled names.” This item was adapted from a daily diary study on hetero-sexism (Mohr & Sarno, 2016). Answer categories were 0 = No and 1 = Yes.When Yes was selected, participants were asked “Could you describe thisnegative experience? You can be as elaborate as you want.” Similar to Study 1,the answers to these open-ended questions were independently coded by twocoders for 16 types of sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions (seeTable 1). Thus, we took a deductive approach to coding the data (Crabtree &Miller, 1999). After coding, the two coders compared their codes. Coderswould discuss until consensus was reached. One diary entry could be coded asmultiple types of microaggressions. Some entries to the open-ended questionsdid not describe microaggressions, and others were not described clearlyenough to code as a microaggression type. Neither of these entries wereincluded in the analyses (n = 50). Besides all the different microaggressiontypes, we also created a variable indicating if a participant reported at least onemicroaggression type during the study named Any microaggression.Sexual Identity. Sexual identity was assessed with the item “How wouldyou describe your sexual identity?” with answer options: 1 = Lesbian, 2 =Gay, 3 = Bisexual, 4 = Queer, 5 = Pansexual, 6 = Heterosexual, 7 = I don’tl. 15NP21308 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 37(21-22)know, and 8 = Other, namely. Two female participants identified as gay.Because these participants used an identity that indicated same-sex attractionas cisgender women, we refer to them as Lesbian throughout the manuscript.Sexual identity was recoded as 0 = Gay, 1 = Lesbian, 2 = Bisexual, and 3 =Queer/Pansexual/Heterosexual/I don’t know/Other, namely.Sex assigned at birth and gender identity. To assess sex assigned at birth andgender identity we used the recommended two-step approach (The GenIUSSGroup, 2014). Sex assigned at birth was assessed with the following item:“What is the sex you were assigned at birth?”with answer options 1 =Male, 2= Female, and 3 =Other, namely. There were no participants that answered 3 =Other. Responses were recoded such that 0 = Female and 1 = Male. Genderidentity was assessed with the following item “How would you describe yourgender identity?” with answer options 1 =Man, 2 =Woman, 3 = Transgenderman, 4 = Transgender woman, 5 = Non-binary, 6 = Genderqueer, 7 =Genderfluid, 8 = Don’t know, and 9 = Other, namely. Because of a relativelysmall number of participants that identified as a gender minority, we recodedthis as 0 = Cisgender if participants had concordant sex assigned at birth andgender identities (Female or Male assigned at birth, and Woman or Man asgender identity, respectively). If participants reported a gender identity thatwas not concordant with their sex assigned at birth, they were considered 1 =Gender minority.Number of days of participation. A variable was created that reflected thenumber of days participated in the daily diary study.Analytic Strategy. Similar to Study 1, we assessed reports of sexual and genderidentity-based microaggression types across all study days. Second, to studygroup-based differences in microaggressions, separate analyses were con-ducted with each sexual and gender identity-based microaggression type asthe dependent variable. In all these analyses, sexual identity, gender identity,and sex assigned at birth were simultaneously included as independentvariables. In some cases, the dependent variable was almost perfectly pre-dicted by the independent variables, which means that for specific values ofthe independent variable the dependent variable would almost always take thesame value. This is also referred to as quasi-separation and leads to inflatedestimates. To handle this, we conducted Firth logistic regression analyses,which use a penalized likelihood estimation method (Firth, 1993; Leitgöb,2020).Further, the rule of thumb for logistic regression analyses is to have 10outcome events per independent variable. However, simulation studies haveshown that this can be relaxed to 5–9 events per independent variable(Vittinghoff & McCulloch, 2007). Therefore, we conducted analyses only16 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 0(0Kiekens et al. NP21309when a specific microaggression type was reported at least 20 times during thestudy (4 independent variables × 5 events = a minimum of 20 events peranalysis). Because of this, analyses of subgroup differences were onlyconducted for the following microaggression types: Use of heterosexist ortransphobic terminology, discomfort/disapproval of the LGBTQ experience,microaggressions as humor, familial microaggressions, invalidation ofLGBTQ identity, and threatening behaviors. All analyses were performed inStata 16 (StataCorp, 2019) and we controlled for number of days of par-ticipation in the Firth logistic regression analyses.ResultsTable 1 presents the number and percentage of participants who reported asexual and gender identity-based microaggression and the frequency a mi-croaggression was reported by all participants. The mean number of days thatparticipants completed a diary entry was 12.02 (SD = 3.51) of 14 diary days. Intotal, 155 (39%) of all participants reported at least one sexual and genderidentity-based microaggression. The mean number microaggressions reportedduring the study was 0.92 (SD = 1.63).The three microaggression types that were reported by most participantsdescribed experiences in which participants felt that they were treated withdisrespect or condemnation (discomfort/disapproval of the LGBTQ experi-ence, reported by 17% of all participants), experiences in which heterosexist/transphobic language was used to degrade participants (use of heterosexist ortransphobic terminology, reported by 12% of all participants), and experi-ences in which participant’s SGM identity was undermined or questioned(invalidation of LGBTQ identity, reported by 8% of all participants). Onlyexperiences in which the existence of heterosexist/homophobic was denied(denial of the reality of heterosexism/transphobia) were not reported byparticipants.Table 2 presents the results of the Firth logistic regression analyses inwhich sexual identity, gender identity, and sex assigned at birth were used topredict the occurrence of microaggression types. Lesbian (OR = .26, 95% CI:.09–.71) and bisexual (OR = .38, 95% CI: .16–.91) participants had lowerodds of reporting any microaggression type than gay participants. Focusing onspecific microaggression types, bisexual participants had lower odds of re-porting experiences in which heterosexist/transphobic language was used (useof heterosexist or transphobic terminology, OR = .21, 95% CI: .04–.99) thangay participants. Participants assigned male at birth had lower odds of re-porting experiences in which their SGM identity was undermined or ques-tioned (invalidation of LGBTQ identity, OR = .004, 95% CI: .0001–.35) thanparticipants assigned female at birth. Last, gender minority participants hadhigher odds of reporting experiences in which others questioned their sexuall. 17NP21310 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 37(21-22)or gender identity (invalidation of LGBTQ identity, OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.19–6.32), higher odds of reporting disapproval by family in a microaggressivemanner (familial microaggressions, OR = 4.46, 95% CI: 1.71–11.63), andhigher odds of non-physical assault (threatening behaviors, OR = 4.58, 95%CI: 1.65–12.71) than cisgender participants.ConclusionAll sexual and gender identity-based microaggression types were reportedduring the 14-day period of the study, except the denial of the reality ofheterosexism/transphobia. In general, lesbian women and bisexual partici-pants were less likely to report any microaggression type than gay partici-pants. Concerning specific microaggression types, bisexual participants wereless likely to experience heterosexist or transphobic terminology than gayparticipants. Participants assigned male at birth were less likely to experienceinvalidation of LGBTQ identity than participants assigned female at birth.Last, gender minority participants were more likely to report experiences withinvalidation of LGBTQ identity, familial microaggressions, and threateningbehaviors.DiscussionThe present study aimed to examine (1) the types of sexual and genderidentity-based microaggressions SGM youth report and (2) differences inthese experiences by sexual and gender identity, and sex assigned at birth. Tothis end, data from two studies among Dutch SGM youth were used.Across both studies, all previously identified sexual and gender identity-related microaggression types were reported by SGM youth. However, therewas sizable variability in the reported frequency. Across both studies, mostSGM youth reported microaggression types in which they felt that they weretreated with disrespect or condemnation and in which heterosexist/transphobic language was used to degrade SGM people. Given that thesefindings were observed in two independent studies, using different questionswith varying time frames provides strong evidence of what types of mi-croaggressions SGM youth frequently experience. It is not surprising,however, that these types of microaggressions are reported by most SGMyouth. Previous studies have shown widespread use of heterosexist andtransphobic terminology in schools (Kosciw et al., 2018) and much of the(social) media messaging that youth come across includes derogatory termsand exclusionary language (Kosciw et al., 2018; Sinclair et al., 2012). Further,considering the polarization of discussions around access to affirmativehealthcare, conversion therapy, access to bathrooms, participation in sports,18 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 0(0Kiekens et al. NP21311and inclusive sexuality education, SGM youth are likely to be confronted withdisapproval of their sexual or gender identity on an almost daily basis.Interestingly, across both studies, several microaggressions were reportedby less than 10% of SGM youth, for example, denial of individual hetero-sexism/transphobia, denial of the reality of heterosexism/transphobia, denialof personal body privacy, and systemic and environmental microaggressions.Several potential explanations may account for the low frequency of expe-riences with these microaggression types in our samples. First, although theseforms of microaggressions may simply occur less frequently, it is also possiblethat they are more covert and less explicit to SGM youth, making it moredifficult for these youth to describe the experiences. Second, some of the lessfrequently reported microaggression types were initially identified in a sampleof gender minority people (Nadal et al., 2012). In the present study, a relativelysmall proportion of SGM youth reported a minority gender identity, whichmight explain why these microaggression types were reported less often.Third, the microaggression framework is partially based on the subjectiveexperiences of minority groups—it lies in the eye of the beholder whether asituation is perceived as a microaggression (Lilienfeld, 2017). Although thesubjective nature of microaggressions does not decrease the impact, somemicroaggression types may be reported less often than others because theywere not perceived as a microaggressive event. Last, heteronormative cultureis so ingrained in our society that stigma occurs at different levels, some ofwhich may not stand out to SGM youth. For example, school practices andcurricula might be rooted in heteronormativity (Steck & Perry, 2018) which israrely seen as overtly discriminatory and may therefore be less noticeable toSGM youth, making it difficult to put these experiences into words.We found several differences in the experience of microaggressions bysexual identity and sex assigned at birth. For sexual identity, we found thatlesbian women and bisexual youth were less likely to report any micro-aggression type than gay youth. This difference between lesbian women andgay youth could be explained by the finding that sexual minority men, ingeneral, experience more victimization, and perhaps also microaggressions(Pachankis et al., 2020). The difference with bisexual youth and gay men canbe explained by the finding that gay men have higher levels of outness whichhas been associated with more victimization (Kosciw et al., 2015; Pachankiset al., 2020). This could also explain our finding that bisexual youth were lesslikely to report experiences in which heterosexist/transphobic language wasused than gay men. Focusing on sex assigned at birth, youth assigned male atbirth were less likely to report experiences in which their SGM identity wasundermined or questioned than youth assigned female at birth, which was inline with expectations that cisgender women may experience daily indignitiesmore often than cisgender men (Lewis, 2017; Swim et al., 2001). Last, wefound several differences in the occurrence of microaggressions by genderl. 9NP21312 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 37(21-22)identity. Gender minority youth were more likely to report experiences inwhich their sexual or gender identity was questioned by others, disapproval byfamily in a microaggressive manner, and experiences of non-physical assault.Previous studies have shown that gender minority people often face thehighest levels of prejudice and stigma compared to cisgender sexual minoritypeople (Martı́n-Castillo et al., 2020; Su et al., 2016). It is therefore notsurprising that gender minority youth were more likely to experience situ-ations in which their gender identity was questioned by others or experienceswith non-physical assault. Further, experiences with disapproval by family ina microaggressive manner was originally identified in a sample of transgenderpeople (Nadal et al., 2012) and therefore it could have been expected thatgender minority youth would reported these experiences more often. Becausethe gender binary is strongly engrained in western culture and is topic ofseveral heated societal debates, it is not surprising that gender minority youthare confronted with their gender identity being questioned by others, that theyface disapproval by family, and experience non-physical assault.Our relatively small sample sizes could have led to low statistical power todetect differences in the occurrence of microaggression types by sexual andgender identity, and sex assigned at birth in Study 2. Previous research pointsto differences by sexual identity (Nadal et al., 2016) and sex assigned at birth(Capodilupo et al., 2010; Nadal et al., 2016). Therefore, we should be carefulto interpret our results as null findings, especially because we were unable toassess group differences for each sexual and gender identity-based micro-aggression type.Taken together, Dutch SGM youth reported most of the previously for-mulated sexual and gender identity-based microaggression types. This isimportant considering that the sexual and gender identity-based micro-aggression types were previously deducted from theoretical work or inqualitative studies but had not yet been tested in a larger quantitativeframework. Our findings are informative because experiences with micro-aggressions may play a role in health disparities among SGM youth. Increating safe spaces for SGM youth in schools and healthcare, we should alsobe wary that discomfort and disapproval of SGM youth as well as the use ofheterosexist or transphobic terminology is common. Especially consideringthat these experiences could contribute to poorer mental health (Kaufmanet al., 2017). Further, our research points to gender minority youth as animportant group that experiences microaggressions most frequently.Limitations and Future DirectionsThe findings of the present study should be considered in light of somelimitations. Including two independent samples of SGM youth came with atleast three disadvantages. First, questions assessing sexual and gender20 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 0(0)Kiekens et al. NP21313identity-based microaggressions were phrased differently across the twostudies. This could have resulted in a different interpretation of the question.For example, in Study 2, youth were explicitly asked to describe negativeexperiences related to their sexual orientation or gender identity, which mighthave resulted in youth more frequently reporting explicit microaggressions(e.g., non-physical assault) than youth in Study 1. Similarly, in Study 1 SGMyouth may have reported experiences that were not directed at them, butoverheard among friends or in school, explaining why use of heterosexist/transphobic terminology was more often reported in Study 1 than in Study 2.Further, in Study 2, participants were explicitly asked to reflect on potentialexperiences related to their gender identity, whereas in Study 1 they were not.This could have affected the microaggressions types reported by genderminority youth in Study 1. Last, on the first day of Study 1, youth coulddescribe experiences that happened in the past year, whereas in Study 2 theywere asked to describe experiences in the past 24 hours. This could haveaffected the frequency with which some microaggressions were reported.Second, another difference between Study 1 and Study 2 is the duration ofthe studies. In Study 1, youth participated in eight daily diaries, whereas inStudy 2, they participated in 14 diaries. Because of the shorter time frame ofStudy 1, it could be that some experiences with microaggressions fell outsideof the study’s sampling period and were therefore missed. Similarly, thesmaller sample size of Study 1 could also have resulted in fewer reportedmicroaggressions.Third, participants in Study 1 were sampled through advertisements onwebsites of LGBT community-based organizations, whereas in Study 2participants were recruited through general advertisements on social media.These different sampling strategies could potentially explain some of thedifferences in demographic characteristics. For example, in Study 2 moreparticipants identified with “emergent” sexual identity labels (e.g., queer andpansexual) and less with identity labels such as lesbian, compared to Study 1.Thus, the broader targeting of sexual minority youth in Study 2 could haveresulted in targeting a more diverse population compared to the narrowertargeting of people who visited websites of LGBT community-basedorganizations.Besides, some more general limitations should be mentioned as well. Forinstance, because the reported frequency of some sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions was low, we could not assess differences by sexualidentity and gender identity, and sex assigned at birth for these micro-aggression types. We encourage future research to quantitatively study dif-ferences by sexual identity and gender identity, and sex assigned at birth in theexperience of sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions.Kiekens et al. 21NP21314 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 37(21-22)Further, due to relatively small SGM subgroups, we were unable to identifyand compare youth with emerging sexual identities (e.g., queer or pansexual)or youth with various gender minority identities (e.g., non-binary).Last, the majority of the microaggression literature focusses on the US and ourstudy uniquely examines microaggressions in the Netherlands. However, bothsamples were not particularly diverse with regard to race/ethnicity. That is, mostparticipants did not have a migration background. Sexual minority youth shouldnot be viewed as a homogenous group with homogenous experiences, but ratheras individuals with intersecting identities which shapes their experiences. Futureresearch on sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions should thereforeaim to study experiences of youth inmore diverse samples. For theDutch context,collecting samples of SGM youth with larger numbers of youth with a migrationbackground from, for example, Turkey, Morocco, or Suriname could be relevant.We outline several suggestions for future research. First, future researchshould focus on factors that make youth more vulnerable to the impact ofmicroaggressions on their health and wellbeing. For example, rejectionsensitivity (Downey & Feldman, 1996; Feinstein, 2020) may be a relevantconstruct to consider in research on the impact of microaggressions. Youthhigh in rejection sensitivity may perceive ambiguous events as micro-aggressions and learn to anxiously expect these events in the future (Baamset al., 2020), increasing the impact on their health and wellbeing.Second, future research could expand the focus beyond microaggressiontypes to also study heterogeneity in the occurrence of microassaults, mi-croinsults, and microinvalidations (Sue et al., 2007) among SGM youth. Forexample, more overt forms of microaggressions were reported more fre-quently in Study 2, which might be characterized as microassaults or mi-croinvalidations, whereas microinsults were more prevalent in Study 1.Focusing on these three forms of microaggressions could be a more parsi-monious approach to study microaggressions among SGM youth.Last, future research should consider whether all identified sexual andgender identity-based microaggression types are indeed microaggressions orwhether they could better be conceptualized as regular/macro aggressiveevents. For example, we might question whether the microaggression typethreatening behaviors, understood as conscious non-physical assault (Nadalet al., 2011), is a microaggression or should be considered an overt form ofdiscrimination or verbal assault. This is especially important in research onmental health, as it is currently unclear whether different types of micro-andmacro-aggressions differ in their impact on mental health outcomes.ConclusionThis study found that SGM youth reported all previously described sexual andgender identity-based microaggressions and found that experiences in which22 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 0(0Kiekens et al. NP21315participants felt that they were treated with disrespect or condemnation and inwhich heterosexist/transphobic language was used were most commonlyexperienced. Taken together, the present study was able to study the oc-currence of microaggressions in a quantitative framework, providing a betterunderstanding of the heterogeneity of these experiences among SGM youth.AcknowledgmentsWe thank Maaike Jonker for helping with the coding of the open-ended questions andfor the discussions we had.Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research,authorship, and/or publication of this article: Dr. Baams acknowledges funding fromthe research programme Innovational Research Incentives Scheme Veni(016.Veni.195.099), which is financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO), andfunding from Dynamics of Youth (Utrecht University).ORCID iDWouter J.

    "abstract": "Research describes several sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions that sexual and gender minority (SGM) people might experience. We aimed to examine the occurrence of different sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions among SGM youth and to identify differences by sexual and gender identity, and sex assigned at birth. Open-ended questions about daily experiences were coded for 16 types of sexual and gender identity-based microaggressions in two daily diary studies among Dutch SGM youth (Study 1: N = 90, M age = 17.64 SD = 1.78; Study 2: N = 393, M age = 18.36 SD = 2.65). Several types of microaggressions were identified, and there was sizable variability in the reported frequency. Overall, lesbian women and bisexual youth were less likely to report microaggressions than gay youth. Bisexual youth were less likely to report use of heterosexist or transphobic terminology than gay youth and youth assigned male at birth were less likely to report invalidation of LGBTQ identity than youth assigned female at birth. Last, gender minority youth were more likely to report familial microaggressions, invalidation of LGBTQ identity, and threatening behaviors than cisgender youth. Overall, this study provides empirical support using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods for theorized typologies of microaggressions among Dutch SGM youth",
