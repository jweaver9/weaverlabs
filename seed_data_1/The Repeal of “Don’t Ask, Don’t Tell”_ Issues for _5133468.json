It calls for the repeal of \nthe existing law (Title 10, United States Code, §654) barring open homosexuality in the military \nby prescribing a series of steps that must take place before repeal occurs. One step was fulfilled \non July 22, 2011, when the President signed the certification of the process ending the Don’t Ask, \nDon’t Tell policy, which was repealed on September 20, 2011. However, in repealing the law and \nthe so-called ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy, a number of issues have been raised, but were not \naddressed by P.L. 111-321. This report considers issues that Congress may wish to consider as the \nrepeal process proceeds.  \nUnder the Constitution, Congress has the authority for making “rules for the government and \nregulation” of the military services. Legislation has been proposed in the 112th Congress that \ncould affect the repeal process by requiring the certification of the repeal by all members of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and not just the Chairman, as was the case. It has also been suggested that \nCongress could hold hearings before or after the final repeal occurs concerning such matters as \nthe repeal process and anticipated changes in other laws regarding military benefits, for example. \nIssues for consideration include, but are not limited to, congressional oversight of the repeal \nprocess, differences in benefits and privileges some individuals may experience (especially \ndifferences created under the Defense of Marriage Act), changes involving sodomy prohibitions, \nand efforts by some to expand the repeal to include transgender individuals. \nCertain military benefits and privileges are extended to spouses as defined by law. Under the \nDefense of Marriage Act, the federal government recognizes marriage as the union of one man \nand one woman. However, certain states recognize same-sex marriages. Thus, it is possible for a \nsame-sex couple to be legally married but not eligible for certain military benefits and privileges. \nLaws prohibiting sodomy (defined as “unnatural carnal copulation”) in the military context have \nvaried over time. There existed proposed language in the Senate version of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act in the 112th Congress that would remove sodomy from the Uniformed Code of \nMilitary Justice, effectively decriminalizing sodomy. Similar language did not exist in the House \nversion. This language was not included in the final law. \nThe repeal of the ban on homosexual behavior has encouraged some to expand efforts to end \ndiscrimination against transgender individuals. Based on military fitness policies, individuals who \nhave a history of mental disorders that, in the opinion of the medical examiner, would interfere \nwith or prevent satisfactory performance of military duties are not allowed to serve. Among the \ndisorders cited are “sexual and gender identity disorders.” (These disorders are listed in the \nInternational Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification or ICD-9-CM, 302.) \nAt one time, homosexuality was listed as a psychiatric disorder, but this was removed from the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in 1973. Some have argued that other “gender \ndisorders” should also be removed. Along these lines, advocates believe it is unfair for the \nmilitary to continue to discriminate against these individuals. Others, however, believe that until \nthe DSM and ICD-9-CM are changed, such individuals should continue to be barred from \nserving. \n \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service \nContents \nBackground...................................................................................................................................... 1 \nIssues................................................................................................................................................ 2 \nThe Role of Congress ...................................................................................................................... 3 \nCongressional Oversight ........................................................................................................... 4 \nBenefits and Privileges .................................................................................................................... 5 \nDefense of Marriage Act ........................................................................................................... 6 \nPrivacy and Cohabitation .......................................................................................................... 8 \nSodomy............................................................................................................................................ 8 \nApplication to Transgender Individuals......................................................................................... 10 \nConclusions.................................................................................................................................... 11 \n \nContacts \nAuthor Contact Information........................................................................................................... 11 \n \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service 1 \nBackground \nPrior to 1993, homosexuality was banned in the military under Department of Defense (DOD) \nregulations. The then-existing policy had been in place since the Carter Administration. During \nhis campaign for the presidency, Bill Clinton promised that, if elected, he would “lift the ban.” In \nresponse, Congress began considering legislation on the issue. Following his election, President \nClinton implemented an interim policy seemingly suspending the existing policy until Congress \ncould finish its work. Following a lengthy public consideration of the issue, Congress passed P.L. \n103-160, codified in 10 United States Code Section 654. This language codified the grounds for \ndischarge from the military as follows: (1) the member has engaged in, attempted to engage in, or \nsolicited another to engage in a homosexual act or acts; (2) the member states that he or she is a \nhomosexual or bisexual; or (3) the member has married or attempted to marry someone of the \nsame sex. In implementing the law, the Clinton Administration added language in regulations that \nwent beyond the law and prohibited questioning military members and recruits about their \nsexuality. This policy became known as “Don’t ask, Don’t tell” or DADT.1 \nOn January 27, 2010, during his State of the Union speech, President Obama stated his desire to \nwork with Congress “to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the \ncountry they love because of who they are.”2  \nShortly thereafter, on March 2, 2010, the Secretary of Defense appointed the Honorable Jeh \nCharles Johnson (General Counsel) and General Carter F. Ham to co-chair a working group to \n“undertake a comprehensive review of the impacts of repeal, should it occur, of Section 654 of \nTitle 10 of the United States Code….”3 The unidentified group formed to conduct this study \nbecame known as the Comprehensive Review Working Group or CRWG. The CRWG report was \nissued on November 30, 2010.  \nLegislation was introduced (H.R. 2965), modified4, and after congressional passage, signed into \nlaw by President Obama as P.L. 111-321 on December 20, 2010, setting in motion the process for \nrepealing Section 654, Title 10 United States Code and the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that \nwas promulgated as a result of this law. According to P.L. 111-321, repeal would take effect 60 \ndays after the President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certify \nthat  \n• they have “considered the recommendations contained in the CRWG report and \nthe report’s proposed plan of action,”  \n• “the Department of Defense has prepared the necessary policies and regulations \nto exercise [the repeal of section 654, title 10 USC],” and;  \n                                                 \n1 “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” refers to the Clinton administration policy and not to the law enacted by Congress. \n2 President Barack Obama, White House, Office of the Press Secretary, Remarks of the President in the State of the \nUnion Address, January 27, 2010. \n3 U.S. Department of Defense, Report of the Comprehensive Review of the Issues Associated with a Repeal of “Don’t \nAsk, Don’t Tell,” November 30, 2010: 1.  \n4 H.R. 2965, Rep. Jason Altmire, June 19, 2009. Some confusion exists over H.R. 2965. As originally introduced, H.R. \n2965 was entitled “Enhancing Small Business and Innovation Act of 2009.” Prior to taking up the issue of repeal, the \nlanguage in H.R. 2965 was replaced with the repeal language in other legislation (see H.R. 6520 and S. 4022, for \nexample) and later re-titled “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.” \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service 2 \n• the policies and regulations pursuant to such a repeal are “consistent with the \nstandards of military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and \nrecruiting and retention of the Armed Forces.”  \nThe then-Secretary of Defense, Robert M. Gates, released a memorandum calling on DOD \nmilitary and civilian leaders to deliver a plan for carrying out the repeal by February 4, 2011.5 \nThis memorandum called for the creation of a Repeal Implementation Team (RIT) to develop \nplans for the repeal, update policies for publication following the repeal, train and prepare \nmembers of the force, and provide bi-weekly progress reports. (It is also noteworthy that the \nPentagon would not keep statistics on gay service members.6) \nThe certification occurred on July 22, 2011. As a result, Section 654 and the DADT policy were \nrepealed on September 20, 2011, 60 days after certification.7 \nAccording to reports, the Department of Defense decided on a three-tiered approach to \nimplementing the repeal of DADT that focused on training and education of its personnel. Under \nthis plan, tier one focused on those in senior leadership positions having to deal with the overall \nrepeal process; this group includes military lawyers and chaplains. Tier two was for senior \nleadership who will oversee the education and training of troops in their commands. Finally, tier \nthree was for the rank and file active duty, reserve component, and civilian defense employees.8 \nIssues \nThe enactment of P.L. 111-321 and subsequent DOD actions on DADT raise questions, including \nthe following:  \n• What is the role of Congress in the oversight of the repeal process?  \n• Does DADT repeal apply to state National Guardsmen when not in federal \nservice?  \n• What benefits are available to gay service members and their \npartners/dependents?  \n• Does the federal statute prohibiting the recognition of gay marriages create equal \ntreatment issues?  \n                                                 \n5 U.S. Department of Defense, Secretary of Defense, Memorandum for Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and \nReadiness), Implementation of a Repeal of Title 10, United States Code, Section 654, January 28, 2011. \n6 Philpott, Tom. “Pentagon: Number Of Gay Servicemembers Won’t be Tracked Inside Military.” Special to Stars and \nStripes, February 2, 2011. \n7 For more background information, see CRS Report R40782, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Military Policy and the Law on \nSame-Sex Behavior, by David F. Burrelli, and CRS Report R40795, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: A Legal Analysis, by \nJody Feder. \n8 Shaughnessy, Larry. “DoD Finalizes Plans for Implementing Repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’” CNN.Com, \nFebruary 11, 2011. \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service 3 \n• How will language in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, particularly the \narticle prohibiting sodomy, be affected?  \n• Will a lack of federal language on the topic possibly allow administrative \nregulations prohibiting certain behaviors to be reinstated?9  \n \nThis report will examine these issues. \nThe Role of Congress \nUnder the Constitution, Congress has the authority “To make Rules for the Government and \nRegulation of the land and naval Forces.”10 Congress, via its Members and committees, maintains \noversight of the Armed Forces. It is the duty of the President to execute the laws and to draft the \nmeans of implementing these laws. In the case of the repeal of Section 654, Congress is removing \nthe statutory language prohibiting open homosexuality and allowing the Administration to \nimplement the rules and regulations, subject to this oversight. (Congress did not add new \nlanguage to federal statutes.) \nPrior to the adoption of Section 654 (and the DADT policy), there were no federal statutes \nbanning gay individuals from serving openly in the military. Instead, the ban was contained in \nvarious military regulations. Repeal of Section 654 returns to a situation in which there are no \nfederal statutes regarding open service by gays. In this environment, it could theoretically be \npossible for this or any future Administration to draft regulations that resemble the pre-1993 ban \nor any number of similar restrictions. Some have suggested that it is necessary for Congress to go \nbeyond repealing Section 654 and put into place statutory language that prevents a return to \nrestrictions on service based on sexuality. Others dismiss the possible return to a gay ban as \nunlikely, particularly given such a change would be vulnerable to legal challenges, and therefore \nclaim that the need for such legislation is unnecessary.11  \nStill others have noted that, lacking any prohibitions in law, it is possible for state governors to \nestablish such rules for state National Guard members.12 Advocates for repeal of Section 654 \nsuggested that Congress could go further in considering language that would prevent a governor \nfrom taking such actions. Concerns have also been expressed that such actions could potentially \nchallenge or usurp a governor’s authority when the National Guard is under state control. \n                                                 \n9 Prior to 1993, the so-called “gay ban” was not enshrined in law, but rather in various regulations. \n10 U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, clause. 14. \n11 “But because Congress did not require the military to allow open service, a new president could order his or her \nsecretary of defense to issue new regulations that effectively reinstate the ban...” The Caucus. “Bachmann’s ‘Don’t \nAsk’ Position A Legal Possibility.” The New York Times, August 16, 2011: 12. In fact, it has also been suggested that \ngovernors could do so as a matter of state policy as leaders of state national guard personnel.  \n12 Marshall, Bob. “Ban Homosexuals From National Guard, States have power to block Obama’s social policy.” \nWashington Times, December 29, 2010: B3. \n \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service 4 \nCongressional Oversight \nCongress may also respond to the repeal by exercising its oversight duties. For example, it could \nhold hearings, as well as propose legislative changes to policy affected by the repeal of Section \n654. Arguably, the inclusion of the 60-day waiting period following certification allowed \nCongress time to review any changes or new policies potentially brought about by the repeal. \nTo date, Congress has taken a number of actions:  \nThe House Armed Services Committee included the following proposed language in its version of \nthe 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1540): \nSection 533—Additional Condition on Repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell \nThis section would amend the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-321) to \nrequire the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief Naval Operations, the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force to submit to the congressional defense \ncommittees their written certification that repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law specified in \nsection 654 of title 10, United States Code, will not degrade the readiness, effectiveness, \ncohesion, and morale of combat arms units and personnel of their respective armed force that \nare engaged in combat, deployed to a combat theater, or preparing for deployment to a \ncombat theater.13  \nHowever, the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act did not contain this \nlanguage. \nOther steps Members of Congress have taken include the following:  \n• During this repeal process, Representative Joe Wilson, chairman of the House \nArmed Services Committee’s Military Personnel Subcommittee, stated that he \nplanned to hold hearings on the repeal declaring it “‘irresponsible’ for Congress \nto repeal the ban on openly gay service without giving the House of \nRepresentatives time to hold hearings.”14 To date, no hearings have been \nscheduled specifically on the topic of the repeal. \n• On January 19, 2011, Representative Duncan Hunter introduced H.R. 337,15 a bill \nthat would amend P.L. 111-321 to expand the list of those needed to certify the \nrepeal to include other members of the Joint Chief of Staff (JCS): the Chief of \nStaff of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the Chief of Naval \nOperations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps.16 Supporters of H.R. 337 \n                                                 \n13 This section is similar to H.R. 337, discussed earlier.

Duncan D. Hunter, January 19, 2011. \n16 Earlier attempts to add this language into the Senate’s consideration of H.R. 2965 and the 2011 Defense \nAuthorization Act were blocked when the amendment tree for H.R. 2965 was filled by one Senator and by one \nSenator’s objection to adding the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2011. “‘Amendment \ntrees’ are charts that illustrate certain principles of precedence which guide the Senate amendment process.” See CRS \nReport RS22854, Filling the Amendment Tree in the Senate, by Christopher M. Davis, Summary. See also U.S. \nCongress, Congressional Record, December 18, 2010; and, Shear, Michael D. “Last-Ditch Move to Block Repeal of \n‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ Fails.” The Caucus, the Political and Government Blog of the Times, The New York Times, \n(continued...) \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service 5 \ncontend that it was important to have all military leaders in agreement and they \nhave criticized relying on the certification of only three individuals who stated \ntheir support for repeal before the CRWG’s work was underway.17 Opponents of \nH.R. 337, and the earlier attempts to add similar language requiring the consent \nof the entire JCS viewed it as a “poison pill” given the hesitancy expressed by \nsome JCS members during Senate Armed Services Committee hearings on \nDADT in December 2010.18 This bill was referred to the Committee on Armed \nServices without further action. \n• According to a recent report, the chairman of the House Armed Services \nCommittee, Representative Buck McKeon, “is seeking copies of the written \nassessments performed by each service about the impact of the policy change on \nrecruiting, retention and readiness, which he believes could provide ammunition \nfor an attempt to block the scheduled Sept. 20 date when the ban would lift once \nand for all.”19 Again, it appears that this request has been overtaken by events \nwith the repeal. \nWith repeal of Section 654, Congress retains its oversight authority and may take other actions \nsuch as requesting reports or holding hearings with regard to the effects of repeal on military \ncohesion and effectiveness, disciplinary issues (such as any problems resulting from harassment \nor assault), and any regulatory changes that arise as a result of repeal, for example. \nBenefits and Privileges \nA panoply of pay, benefits, and privileges are available to military personnel. Military dependents \nare also eligible to receive certain benefits and privileges as a result of their relationship with the \nmilitary member. In certain cases, the description of the qualifying relationship exists in law. In \nother cases, a military member may be able to name a beneficiary or beneficiaries. Benefits based \nupon marriage could prove contentious with the repeal of Section 654. \nOn September 21, 1996, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) became law.20 Under this law, \nmarriage is defined as the union between one man and one woman. The federal government, \ntherefore, does not recognize same-sex marriages for the purpose of extending benefits and \nprivileges, although several states do.21 \nCertain DOD benefits, such as Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI), require the service \nmember to designate a recipient in the event of his or her death. In other cases, such as the Death \nGratuity, the service member may designate a beneficiary. If the service member does not \n                                                                 \n(...continued) \nDecember 21, 2010. \n17 Burns, Robert. “Questions Remain On ‘Don’t Ask.’” Philadelphia Inquirer, December 20, 2010. \n18 “A little over a month after saying that repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ would be a distraction and put lives at risk \non the battlefield, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Amos released a video message assuring Marines that he \nwould personally oversee implementation of the repeal within the Corps.” Turner, Derek. “Amos delivers message to \nCorps on DADT.” Stars and Stripes, Stripes Central, January 29, 2011. \n19 “Key lawmaker still not sold on ‘don’t ask’ repeal.” Navy Times, August 8, 2011: 17. \n20 P.L. 104-199; 110 Stat. 2419, September 21, 1996. \n21 See CRS Report RL31994, Same-Sex Marriages: Legal Issues, by Alison M. Smith. \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service 6 \ndesignate a beneficiary, then the law stipulates the beneficiary from a list, beginning with the \nspouse. The services may use this list to pay the first eligible beneficiary. In the case of a same-\nsex marriage, the spouse would not be recognized as an eligible beneficiary under this method \nbecause federal law does not recognize such marriages. \nOther benefits, such as military health care, travel, survivor benefits, and military housing, \nexplicitly designate, in law, who is an eligible beneficiary.22 In addition, policies on \ncompassionate re-assignment and former spouse protection laws, for example, would not apply to \nsame-sex couples.23 As a result of the DOMA and the explicit definitions of eligible beneficiaries \nin service statutes, a member of the military who is in a same-sex marriage will not be afforded \nthe full benefits available to heterosexual couples.  \nOther questions arise. For example, if a military same-sex couple adopts a child, arguably, the \nchild would be eligible to attend DOD Dependent Schools. But the same-sex marriage would not \nbe recognized in considerations for assignments, command-sponsored or otherwise.24 To go \nfurther, if the member dies in such a hypothetical case, the adopted child would be awarded the \nDeath Gratuity ($100,000) unless the service member had explicitly designated the same-sex \nspouse as the beneficiary. Arguably, such varying treatment creates inequalities among service \nmembers that Congress or the courts may be asked to consider. \nDefense of Marriage Act \nIn an effort to contend with the issue of variations in military benefits that may occur as the result \nof certain states recognizing same-sex marriages, it has been suggested that the most direct way to \naddress the issue is to repeal DOMA. Over the years, various efforts have been made to repeal the \nlaw.25 Recent executive and legislative branch actions related to DOMA follow. \nIn February 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder informed Congress that he considered DOMA to \nbe “unconstitutional.” He noted that Members of Congress could, if they wish, defend the law.26 \nShortly after, language was introduced in the House and Senate supporting DOMA,27 and the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Representative John Boehner, announced that former \nSolicitor General Paul Clement would represent the House in its defense of DOMA.28 In \n                                                 \n22 See Title 10 U.S.C., secs. 1072 et seq., for example. \n23 Also to be affected but only mentioned here are those benefits available to spouses of veterans. \n24 Command-sponsored assignments refer to assignments in which the military provides for the dependents to \naccompany the service member. In non-command-sponsored assignments, the military member is responsible for all \ndependents and does not receive assistance from the military. \n25 For example, see H.R. 3567, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, October 19, 2009, S; 598, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, July 7, 2011. In \naddition, the issue has been raised in a number of court cases. See CRS Report RL31994, Same-Sex Marriages: Legal \nIssues, by Alison M. Smith. \n26 “’I will instruct department attorneys to advise courts in other pending Defense of Marriage litigation of the \nPresident’s and my conclusions that the law’s definition of marriage as between a man and a woman is \nunconstitutional, Holder said in a statement.

Following criticism by \ncertain Members of Congress, on May 11, 2011, this policy change was “suspended.”30 \nThe House Armed Services Committee has included the following proposed language in its \nversion of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1540): \nSection 534—Military Regulations Regarding Marriage \nThis section would affirm the policy of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (1 U.S.C. \n7) that the word ‘marriage’ included in any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the \nDepartment of Defense applicable to a service member or civilian employee of the \nDepartment of Defense shall mean only a legal union between one man and one woman.  \nSection 535—Use of Military Installations as Site for Marriage Ceremonies and \nParticipation of Chaplains and Other Military and Civilian Personnel in their Official \nCapacity \nThis section would establish that marriages performed on DOD installations or marriages \ninvolving the participation of DOD military or civilian personnel in an official capacity, to \ninclude chaplains, must comply with the Defense of Marriage Act (1 U.S.C. 7), which \ndefines marriage as only the legal union between one man and one woman.31 \nThese sections were not included in the final version of the bill as passed. \nAnd lastly, the House Appropriations Committee included language in H.R. 2219, its proposed \nFY2012 DOD Appropriations Act, stating, “No funds under the act may be used for activities in \ncontravention of Section 7 of title 1, United States Code (the Defense of Marriage Act).”32 \nSection 7 of Title 1, U.S.C., defines marriage as the union of one man and one woman, and states \nthat the term spouse refers to someone of the opposite sex. This language was not enacted.33 \n                                                                 \n(...continued) \nChris. “News Analysis: What Actually Happened With King and Spalding?” Metroweekly, April 26, 2011. \n29 Savage, Charlie, Justice Dept.

House. Committee on Armed Services, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, \nH.R. 1540, H.Rept. 112-78, 112th Cong., 1st Sess., May 17, 2011: 138. \n32 H.R. 2219, Rep. C.W. Bill Young, Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2012, Sec. 10013, 112th Cong., 1st \nSess., July 11, 2011. \n33 Instead, this appropriations bill and others were passed as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, (P.L. 112-74, \nDecember 23, 2011) without the provision pertaining to the Defense of Marriage Act. \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service 8 \nSenate versions of these bills did not contain similar language. The Senate version included the \nsentence, “A military chaplain who, as a matter of conscience or moral principle, does not wish to \nperform a marriage may not be required to do so.” This language was enacted into law.34 \nPrivacy and Cohabitation \nThe issues of privacy and cohabitation were addressed by the CRWG, which recommended \nagainst segregated housing for gay and lesbian service members: \nAccordingly, we recommend that the Department of Defense expressly prohibit berthing or \nbilleting assignments based on sexual orientation, except that commanders should retain the \nauthority to alter berthing or billeting assignments on an individualized case-by-case basis, in \nthe interest of maintaining morale, good order, and discipline, and consistent with \nperformance of mission.35 \nIn the report, the CRWG received comments from service members regarding privacy and \ncohabitation. Although the CRWG recommended commanders make such berthing and billeting \ndecisions based on military interests, the recommendation allows for “case-by-case” \nconsiderations. The CRWG was concerned that separate facilities would lead to stigmatizing gays \nand lesbians, citing the “separate, but equal” treatment of blacks. However, privacy and \ncohabitation issues remain. For example, a same-sex couple could receive billeting or berthing \nassignments that would allow them to remain together, whereas such arrangements would not be \nconsidered for opposite-sex couples who are not married.36 \nSodomy \nCongressional treatment of sodomy in the military context has varied over time. In 1917, the \nArticles of War of 1916 were implemented prohibiting “assault with the intent to commit any \nfelony, or assault with the intent to do bodily harm.”37 In 1919, following revelations of \n“inappropriate behavior” among naval personnel in Newport, RI, then Assistant Secretary of the \nNavy Franklin D. Roosevelt organized a group of enlisted men to submit to “immoral acts” as \npart of the investigation.38 However, because the men submitted, charges involving “assault” did \n                                                 \n34 P.L. 112-81, Sec. 544, December 31, 2011. \n35 CRWG: 141. \n36 In a related matter, Rep. Hunter was considering introducing legislation that “would require that members of the \nArmed Forces are not pressured to approve of another person’s sexual conduct if that conduct is contrary to the \npersonal principles of the members.” Keyes, Charley. CNN.com, September 6, 2011. Arguably, a commander could \nrefuse to allow gays to share berthing assignments. \n37 64 Stat. 619; at 664; P.L. 64-242; August 29, 1916. Some have erroneously claimed that this law explicitly made \n“assault with intent to commit sodomy” a punishable offense. (Human Rights Watch at \nhttp://www.hrw.org/en/node/12380/section/3). Rather, it appears only broadly to refer to ‘assault.’ However, as \ndescribed in A Manual for Courts-Martial, Corrected to April 15, 1917, page 266, “An assault with intent to commit \nany felony is an assault made with a specific intent to murder, rape, rob, or to commit manslaughter, sodomy, or other \ncommon-law felony.” \n38 “During the time the organization was under the direct supervision of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and particularly \nbetween the dates of May 5 and July 20, 1919, the enlisted men acting as operators or detectives were instructed…to go \nforth into Newport and to allow immoral acts to be performed upon them, if in their judgment it was necessary for the \npurpose of running down and trapping or capturing specified alleged sexual perverts.” U.S. Congress, Senate, \nCommittee on Naval Affairs, Alleged Immoral Conditions at Newport (R.I.) Naval Training Station, 67th Cong., 1st \n(continued...) \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service 9 \nnot apply as specified under the Articles of War. In 1920, Congress prohibited the act of sodomy \nitself.39 Later, Congress created the Uniformed Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and included the \nsodomy provision as Article 125.40  \nArticle 125 of the UCMJ prohibits sodomy: \n(a) Any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with \nanother person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. \nPenetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offense. \n(b) Any person found guilty of sodomy shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.41 \nHowever, the CRWG recommended that Congress repeal Article 125 in a manner consistent with \nthe Supreme Court decision in Lawrence v. Texas.42 Although the Lawrence decision did not \naddress the military context, the court did strike down as unconstitutional a state law that \nprohibited private consensual homosexual sodomy. Other acts involving sodomy, such as forcible \nsodomy, sodomy involving minors, or where it is “service discrediting,” could be prosecuted \nunder Articles 120, “Rape and carnal knowledge,” or 134, “The General Article.” \nThe General Article states: \nThough not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disorders and neglects to the prejudice \nof good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit \nupon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject to this \nchapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general, special, or summary court-\nmartial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the \ndiscretion of that court. \nLegislative provisions have been included in the Senate version of the FY2012 National Defense \nAuthorization Act that would repeal the crime of sodomy under the UCMJ (Article 125) and \nexpand Article 120 (“Rape and Carnal Knowledge”) to include three sections applying to: (1) \nrape and assault against any person, (2) sexual offenses against children, and (3) other non-\nconsensual sexual misconduct. According to the Senate Armed Services Committee report: “All \noffenses previously punishable as forced sodomy under this statute would be punishable under \nthe proposed changes to Article 120, UCMJ.”43 This language was not included in the final \nversion of the law.44 \n                                                                 \n(...continued) \nSess, 1921. “Lay Navy Scandal to F.D.

Cassata, Donna, National \nDefense Authorization Act: Provision Repeals Military Ban on Sodomy, Huffington Post, on-line, December 12, 2011. \nThe Repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”: Issues for Congress \n \nCongressional Research Service 10 \nHowever, had Art. 125 been repealed, consensual sodomy could not be prosecuted. In some ways, \nthis change would have returned prosecution of sodomy to the pre-1920s situation where sexual \nbehavior could only be prosecuted if force was used or an assault occurred such as rape, except \nfor those behaviors covered under the mentioned General Article. The act of sodomy itself would \nno longer have existed as a separate crime under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice. \nApplication to Transgender Individuals \nThe repeal of Section 654 has encouraged some to advocate for other changes to the law and/or \nmilitary policy. Activists have complained that despite the repeal, the military discriminates \nagainst transgender individuals. The term transgender, which encompasses a broad range of \nsexual identities and behaviors, applies to individuals whose gender identity does not conform to \ntheir assigned sex at birth.  \nThe president of the Transgender American Veterans Association says that with the repeal of \nthe military’s ban on open service by gays, transgender and transsexuals are ‘the last \nminority that the Defense Department can and does discriminate against.’ … Opponents of \nrepealing the military’s ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy on gays have mentioned – usually in an \neffort to prevent repeal – the possibility that transvestites and transgender people would also \nhave to be accepted.45 \nBased on military fitness policies, individuals who have a history of mental disorders that, in the \nopinion of the medical examiner, would interfere with or prevent satisfactory performance of \nmilitary duties are not allowed to serve. Among the disorders cited are “sexual and gender \nidentity disorders.” (These disorders are listed in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th \nRevision, Clinical Modification or ICD-9-CM, 302.) At one time, homosexuality was listed as a \npsychiatric disorder, but this was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in \n1973. The 1973 decision to make the change concerning the removal of homosexuality from the \nDSM as a mental disorder was contentious among its members.46 Any similar change concerning \ntransgender individuals by the APA, or successful court challenges, could affect military policies. \n(DSM and ICD have merged their codes.) \nIn one example, following the passage of P.L. 111-321 establishing the process of repealing \nSection 654, a few college/university campus activists have used the “transgender discrimination” \nargument as a reason for continuing to block military service recruiters or Reserve Officer \nTraining Corps (ROTC) programs from campus.47 However, there seems to be little evidence of \nthis issue having adverse effects on military-academia relations.48 \n                                                 \n45 “Activist: Military still discriminates against transgender people.” Navy Times, February 14, 2011: 14. \n46 Grimes, William. “Alfred Freedman, a Leader in Psychiatry, Dies at 94.” New York Times, April 20, 2011. “In 1972, \nwith pressure mounting from gay rights groups and from an increasing number of psychiatrists to destigmatize \nhomosexuality, Dr. Freedman was elected president of the association,... Its 20,000 members were deeply divided about \nits policy on homosexuality....” Although some have claimed that this decision was medically based, others note that it \nwas a political decision, see Bayer, Ronald.

It is \nanticipated that the repeal will become official on September 20, 2011. However, Congress, the \nDepartment of Defense, and perhaps the courts may be presented with additional issues to \nconsider after repeal takes effect. As a result, the final resolution to these additional issues may \nextend well beyond the date of repeal. \n \nAuthor Contact Information \n \nDavid F.

    "abstract": "[Excerpt] On December 22, 2010, President Obama signed P.L. 111-321 into law. It calls for the repeal of the existing law (Title 10, United States Code, §654) barring open homosexuality in the military by prescribing a series of steps that must take place before repeal occurs. One step was fulfilled on July 22, 2011, when the President signed the  certification of the process ending the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, which was repealed on September 20, 2011. However, in repealing the law and the so-called ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy, a number of issues have been raised, but were not addressed by P.L. 111-321. This report considers issues that Congress may wish to consider as the repeal process proceeds",
