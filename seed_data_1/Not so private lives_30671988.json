This \npattern was reversed for males with significantly larger numbers reporting a sexual attraction \nexclusively to males, compared with a romantic attraction exclusively to males. \n From the total sample, close to a third of participants (29.9%) indicated a difference between the \nextent to which they felt romantically attracted and the extent to which they felt sexually \nattracted to males and/or females.  Only 1.2% indicated an exactly equal attraction to males and \nfemales, when it came to both romantic and sexual attraction.  This suggests that even for \npeople who identify as bisexual it is rarely a simple case of equal attraction to men and women. \nAwareness and First Disclosure of Same-Sex Attractions \n Although males, as a group, were sure of their attractions before females, they took significantly \nmore time on average to disclose these attractions.  On average, female and gender different \nparticipants disclosed around one year after they felt sure of their sexuality, whereas for males \nthe average was three and a half years.  These results are discussed in terms of the higher levels \nof victimization reported by nonheterosexual males relative to their female counterparts. \n Females in the oldest cohort reported, on average, being sure of their same-sex  attractions close \nto 7 ½ years later than females in the youngest cohort.  This certainty was 3 years later for the \noldest cohort of males and 4 years later for the oldest cohort of gender different participants, \nwhen compared with their younger counterparts.  The greater differences found for females are \ndiscussed in terms of longitudinal evidence for the greater ‘fluidity’ of female sexuality. \nOngoing Disclosure of Sexuality  \n Participants were presented with three scenarios in which they were asked to consider disclosing \ntheir same-sex attractions to a presumed to be ‘straight’ couple at a social gathering unrelated to \nwork.  Close to two-thirds (65.9%) of participants, who reported having a regular same-sex \npartner, selected an option to disclose now to a couple depicted as being possibly conservative, \nalthough for most this depended on its relevance to the conversation.  By contrast, the majority \n(53.8%) of participants who reported not currently having a regular partner stated they were not \nlikely to disclose at all or would most probably delay disclosure until another time.   For those \npartnered, opting to ‘come out’ was even greater among those who reported a higher level of \ncompatibility with their partner when it came to feeling comfortable with one’s sexuality.  \n The above findings suggest that, even for those who may wish to ‘come out’, deciding to disclose \nmay be hampered by one’s current single status or a lack of compatibility with a partner’s level of \ndisclosure comfort.  Although casually introducing or mentioning a partner may facilitate \ndisclosure, in much the same way heterosexual individuals convey the nature of their \nrelationships, this option is not always possible for some.  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     2 \n \n Findings revealed that it was only the extent of religious influence on disclosure (including the \nreligious beliefs of others), rather than a person’s own religious beliefs, that was related to the \nlikelihood of ‘coming out’.  Specifically, the greater the religious influence the significantly lower \nthe likelihood of disclosure, even for the ‘most likely to be positive’ outcome scenario. \n The above results are discussed in relation to recent experimental research in Australia which \nfound heterosexual individuals responded more favourably to upfront disclosure of a person’s \nsame-sex attractions when compared with delayed.  \nRelationships and Recognition \n Although participants identifying as female were significantly more likely to report having a \ncurrent same-sex partner, those identifying as male were significantly more likely to report being \nin a current relationship of a longer duration. \n The majority of participants (54.7 %) selected marriage as their personal choice for relationship \nrecognition (when including participants who did not complete the survey in full, the figure was \n54.2% - see Appendix for Auxiliary Report).  A federally recognised relationship documented at a \nregistry (other than marriage) was the second most popular option (27.6%) followed by de facto \nstatus (14.8%).  Of the sample, 2.9% reported that they preferred no legal status.  \n The younger the age of the participant the more likely they were to have selected marriage as \ntheir personal choice.  For example, 66.7% of those 18-19, and 62.8% of those 20-29 selected \nmarriage as their preference. \n The majority preference for marriage was larger for participants identifying as female (58.1%), \nwhen compared with male (50.7%) or gender different (44.7%).  For the youngest cohort (< 25 \nyears), however, differences between males and females were no longer observed with 63% \nfrom both groups selecting the option to marry. \n Irrespective of their personal choice, 78% reported that they would like to see marriage become \navailable as an option for same-sex couples in Australia, 59.7% reported that they would like to \nsee a federally recognised relationship other than marriage be made available and 48.4% stated \nthat they would like to see de facto recognition remain.  These percentages indicate that many \nparticipants selected multiple options, suggesting that simply having a choice was an important \nfactor. \n Although a majority preference for marriage was found regardless of the legal status of a \nparticipant’s same-sex relationship, preferences for marriage were higher among those currently \nin a relationship formalised through a state or municipal registry, an overseas recognised civil \nunion/partnership, and an overseas recognised marriage.   \n The more people felt their relationships were valued on a comparable level with different-sex \nrelationships, the significantly greater their reported level of overall well-being. \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     3 \n \nChildren \n Overall, 29.2% of those indentifying as female, 10.0% of those identifying as male, and 25.5% of \ngender different participants reported having children in their lives, either their own or the result \nof a current or previous relationship.  When considering the age group most likely to have \nchildren, given that people in general are having children in later years (ABS, 2008),  47.1% of \nfemale and 17.6% of male participants reported having children in their lives, whether their own \nor the result of a current or previous relationship.  \n Close to a third of both young male and female participants (< 25 yrs) reported that they planned \nto have children at some stage in their lives. \n Of participants with at least one child in their lives under the age of 20, 64.7% of female, 24.1% \nof male and 40% of gender different participants were living with these children full-time.   \n For participants with a same-sex partner and living full-time with children under the age of 13 \n(i.e., generally primary school age) 74.7% reported that they would prefer to marry.  For those \nwith children under the age of 5 (i.e., non-school age) 80.8% selected marriage as their \npreference.   \nPartners \n Higher levels of perceived partner support, relationship satisfaction, and partner similarity in \nbeing comfortable with one’s sexuality, were all significantly related to higher levels of \npsychological well-being. \n Participants in the youngest cohort (< 25 years) reported significantly less similarity between \nthemselves and their partner regarding ‘coming out’ to others, and being comfortable as a same-\nsex couple, when compared with those in the two older cohorts (i.e., 25-34 years and 35+ years). \n Participants identifying as female reported significantly higher levels of relationship satisfaction \nand partner support, relative to male and gender different participants.  This is consistent with \nresearch in general, in which females tend to score higher than males for measures of positive \nrelationships with others (e.g., Ryff & Keyes, 1995).  \nGLBTI Friends and Community \n Just over a third of participants reported that they did not have any contact with individuals \n(apart from friends) from the GLBTI community.  The younger the cohort the less likely they were \nto have reported contact with the GLBTI community or feel connected to the GLBTI community, \nwith this being the case for both metropolitan and rural areas of residence.  \n Not surprisingly, those living in more populated areas were significantly more likely to report \nfeeling a greater connection with the GLBTI community, relative to those living in less populated \nareas.  For those with contact with the community, however, perceptions of support did not \ndiffer between metropolitan and rural areas.  \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     4 \n \nFamily and Heterosexual Friends and Community \n A majority of those under the age of 25 reported that ‘most’ to ‘all’ of their friends were \nheterosexual, whereas for those in the oldest cohort (35+ years) the percentage was less than a \nthird.  Nonetheless, and with the exception of those 60 years of age and over, older participants \nwere significantly more likely to report that a greater proportion of their heterosexual friends \nwere aware of their sexuality, relative to younger participants. \n Even when first taking into account the support participants received from their GLBTI friends \nand the GLBTI community, significantly higher levels of well-being were associated with greater \nperceptions of acceptance from heterosexual friends, parents and the wider community. \n The more people felt accepted by their heterosexual friends, parents and siblings the significantly \ngreater the likelihood of them having reported an ongoing same-sex relationship.  \n When taking into account age differences, people with a same-sex partner who felt more \naccepted by their heterosexual friends and siblings were more likely to report a current \nrelationship of a significantly longer duration.  \nStigma and Psychological Well-Being \n The highest perceptions of stigma related to issues regarding same-sex attracted people and the \ncaring of children (e.g., a same-sex attracted teacher in a public school).  Perceptions in relation \nto stigma and employment were much more positive, with 78% agreeing to some extent that \nemployers would hire a same-sex attracted person if qualified.  \n Gender different participants and transgender/transsexual and intersex participants scored \nhigher on perceptions of stigma and lower on reported well-being, when compared with the \ngeneral sample. \n Data were compared between a national American LGB sample (Rostosky et al., 2009), the \ncurrent sample and a random sample of Australians (MacKinnon et al., 1999).  Participants from \nboth the American LGB survey and the current survey were found to score significantly higher on \nnegative emotional experiences but did not report less positive emotional experiences, when \ncompared with the Australian random sample.  These differences for negative mood between \nnonheterosexual individuals and those from the Australian random sample were more \npronounced in the case of male participants. \n Relative to an American national sample (MIDUS II), participants in the current survey scored \nsignificantly lower on the Environmental Mastery, Purpose in Life and Self-Acceptance dimensions \nof well-being (PWB: Ryff, 1989).  Participants from the current survey, however, scored \nsignificantly higher on perceptions of Personal Growth.  These findings are similar to those found \nfor comparisons between  a subsample of American sexual minority participants and their \nheterosexual counterparts (Riggle, Rostosky, & Danner, 2009) \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     5 \n \nResearch Background \nThe Not So Private Lives online survey was conducted through the School of Psychology at The \nUniversity of Queensland, Australia.  The aim of the survey was to add to the growing body of \nresearch on the lives of sexual minorities in Australia.  The questions within the survey focused on a) \nthe timing of disclosure of same-sex attractions b) preferred relationship recognition c) same-sex \nattracted individuals’ perceptions of how others value their relationships relative to different-sex \nrelationships d) parenting, and e) the role of mainstream acceptance in relation to psychological \nwell-being, even when in the presence of LGBTI support. \nNot So Private Lives is the first national study to examine same-sex attracted Australians’ preferences \nfor various forms of relationship recognition since the introduction of de facto status for same-sex \ncouples at a federal level.  Further, it is the first major study to investigate preferences for \nrelationship recognition while taking into account the current legal status (in Australia or overseas) of \nan individual’s same-sex relationship.  Findings in these areas were presented at the Australian \nFederal Senate hearing of the inquiry into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009 \n(Commonwealth of Australia. Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, November 9, 2009). \nThe survey site was hosted as a secure site by Globalpark through its Unipark program for academic \nresearch.  Globalpark has its headquarters in Germany and is one of the leading international \nsuppliers of online software for academic and commercial research.  All data collection and storage \nwere provided by Globalpark.  The URL for the web-page entry to the survey was \nwww.notsoprivatelives.com.  This report on the survey’s findings is currently available at this site.  \nRecruitment \nThe survey commenced on the 3rd April 2009 and ran until midnight, 15th August 2009.  Responses to \nthe survey decreased substantially in the latter two weeks, suggesting the sample had reached its \nmaximum uptake.  The survey was advertised online in the GLBTQI press for every state and territory \nand in print in various GLBTQI magazines (e.g., LOTL, SX Magazine, Queensland Pride, AX National, \nMCV and Sydney Star Observer).  Information on the survey was also circulated through sexual \nminority email networks across the country.  Flyers and/or email information were sent to sexual \nminority - businesses, health and community centres, sporting clubs, reading groups, parenting \ngroups, outdoor activity groups, city and country social clubs, chat rooms and coffee shops, as well as \nuniversity queer collectives and sexual minority welcoming religious organisations.  The survey was \nalso promoted via Queer radio (e.g., JOY FM – Melbourne) and flyers were distributed at sexual \nminority events (e.g., Brisbane Pride Day and the Brisbane Queer Film Festival).  Participants were \nalso asked to consider informing their same-sex attracted friends/contacts about the survey. \nOf the potential participants who started the survey, 192 did not pass the eligibility check (see \ncriteria for eligibility on p. 6) and a further 121 did not proceed past the session information page or \nconsent form.  Of the 2,545 people who started the survey proper (i.e., answered Q.1), 2,056 \ncompleted the last question indicating a retention rate of 80.8%.  Of this number, the responses of \n24 participants were not included in the analyses due to a high percentage of missing data, leaving a \ntotal number of 2,032.  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     6 \n \nEligibility \nParticipants were invited to take part in the survey provided they met the criteria of being: \na) at least 18 years of age  \nb) a citizen or permanent resident of Australia \nc) attracted (sexually and/or romantically) to people of the same sex \nParticipants, who did not select the ‘Yes’ option for all three of the questions addressing the criteria, \nwere thanked for their interest and directed away from the survey.  Identification as same-sex \nattracted was further verified by the Sexual Identity and Sexual and Romantic Attraction measures in \nthe main body of the survey (see Chapter 2).  \nGender Different, Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \nTo be consistent with earlier experimental and survey research, which served as foundations for the \ncurrent study, this research focused on individuals who identified as same-sex attracted.  Therefore, \nthis survey also welcomed gender different, transgender, transsexual and intersex participants who \nfelt that they met this criterion.  It is acknowledged, however, that the term ‘same-sex attracted’, by \ndefinition, can be problematic for those whose biological sex and/or gender identity do not adhere to \nthe assumptions that all people are born either strictly male or female, and that one’s sex defined at \nbirth is consistent with a person’s gender identity.  As the survey did not attempt to explore how \nparticipants might differentiate between their attractions in terms of sexual anatomy and their \nattractions in terms of gender role, the term ‘same-sex attracted’ is used to broadly define an \nindividual’s personal assessment of their sexual and romantic attraction to others.  \nAuxiliary Report \nAn auxiliary report, based on the responses of 2, 232 participants, was released in August 2009.  This \nreport detailed the findings in relation to a sub-set of questions presented in the first third of the \nsurvey on current relationship status and preferences for relationship recognition.  The examination \nof these factors aimed to provide an insight into the preferences of same-sex attracted Australians \nwith regard to the legal recognition of their relationships, following the introduction of de facto \nstatus for same-sex couples at a federal level.  These findings were presented at the Australian \nFederal Senate hearing of the inquiry into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009 \n(Commonwealth of Australia. Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, November 9, 2009). \nFindings from this larger sample were found to be consistent with those of the current sample of \n2,032 (200 fewer) participants who completed the survey in full.  Nonetheless, it was deemed more \nappropriate to provide results to the inquiry based on the larger sample, to ensure the relationship \nfindings were not representative of people who may have been more inclined to complete a lengthy \nsurvey.  To compare ‘relationship recognition’ figures based on those who completed the survey in \nfull with those including participants who did not, refer to the findings discussed in Chapter 5 and \nthose provided in the Auxiliary Report provided in the Appendix.   \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     7 \n \nOverview of Analytical Methods \nA consistent analytical strategy was taken in that a variety of descriptive and inferential statistical \nmethods were employed including, but not limited to, Independent Factorial Analysis of Variance \n(ANOVA), Factorial Repeated Measures ANOVA, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), Multivariate \nAnalysis of Variance (MANOVA), Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA), Hierarchical \nMultiple Regression, Binary Logistic Regression, and Pearson’s Chi-Square tests.  For analyses \ninvolving multiple comparisons between groups, the Bonferroni method was used to control the \nfamilywise Type I error rate.  For all analyses, results are discussed as being significant if p < .05. \nIn instances where a variable was both categorical and continuous (e.g., age group), analyses were \nconducted based on both characterisations of the variable.  Results related to these variables are \ngenerally presented in bar graphs with the categorical data, to assist with the visual interpretation of \nfindings. \nFor the analyses of age as a categorical variable, results were presented based on either six age \ngroups (i.e., 18-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+) or three age cohorts (i.e., <25, 25-34, 35+)1.  \nAlthough analyses were conducted for both numbers of categories, results are presented in the \nreport based on the most meaningful interpretation of findings.  For example, if significant \ndifferences were found between participants in the most senior age group (60+) relative to the rest \nof the sample, findings are reported based on the six age groups in order to highlight these findings. \nAs all participants who selected the transgender/transsexual or intersex response options identified \nas either male or female, these participants were included in all findings for the general sample.  To \nhelp increase visibility of these individuals in sexual minority research, separate analyses were also \nprovided, where appropriate.  \nFor ease of interpretation, the ‘Gender Different’ and ‘Other’ response categories were combined to \nform a single category (‘Gender Different’) to represent those who identified as other than male or \nfemale.  The most frequently described identity for those who selected the ‘Other’ option was \n‘gender queer’.  Although the number of gender different participants was relatively small (N = 47), \nnumbers were fairly well distributed across states/territories (NSW = 14, VIC = 12, QLD = 9, WA = 10, \nACT = 2). \nIn all cases, analyses were conducted to examine gender differences, age differences and \ninteractions between predictor variables.  In the absence of any discussion of these findings, \ndifferences were not found to be statistically significant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                          \n1\n The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies youth as being from 15-24 years of age, young people generally as being up to \nthe age of 34, and those 35 and older as no longer young adults (ABS, 2009a; 2010) \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     8 \n \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     9 \n \n11.91%\n18.50%\n2.07%\n5.17%\n28.79%\n0.89%\n26. 72%\n5.95%\n0 200 400 600 800\n1\nNumber of respondents\nA\nxi\ns\nSt\nat\ne/\nTe\nrr\nit\no\nry\nTi\ntl\ne ACT (121)\nNSW (544)\nNT (18)\nQLD (585)\nSA (105)\nTAS (42)\nVIC (376)\nWA (242)\n1. Demographics \nA total of 2,032 participants completed the survey in full.  This was 200 (9%) fewer than the number \nwho completed the first phase of the survey which included the Relationship Recognition measures \n(see Appendix).  Importantly, the characteristics of the sample on which the current report is based \ndid not differ substantially from those of the larger sample.  For comparative figures, refer to the \nAuxiliary Report in the Appendix. \n1.1 Area of Residence \nParticipants were asked to select their state or territory of residence and the type of urban or rural \narea in which they lived (see Figure 1 and Table 1).  For this sample, thirty-two participants selected \nthe ‘currently living overseas’ option and were asked to provide the name of their home state or \nterritory in Australia.  These numbers are accounted for in Figure 1 below.  The survey attracted a \nproportionately greater number of participants from Queensland, despite advertising across all \nstates and territories.  This is likely to have been a result of the survey being conducted in \nQueensland and advertised through The University of Queensland.    \nFigure 1.   \n  \nNumbers and percentages of participants according to state/territory of residence  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1.  \n \nNumbers and percentages of participants according to area of current residence  \n        N                %  \nCapital City 1494 73.5  \nOther metropolitan area (population 100,000 or more)   287 14.1  \nLarge rural centre (25,000 – under 100,000)   131   6.4  \nOther rural area    103   5.1  \nRemote     17   0.8  \n(N = 2032) \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     10 \n \n1.2 Cultural Ancestry  \nParticipants were asked to indicate their cultural background by nominating up to two ancestries, as \nrequested for the 2006 Australian Census.  Thirty nine participants chose not to respond to this \nquestion leaving a total of 1993 respondents.  As participants were able to select up to two \nancestries (e.g., British and German), the percentages represent multiple responses and therefore \nadd up to over 100%.  Where numbers were very small for a particular ancestry, they were either \ngrouped or represented as ‘Other’.  The most frequently listed ancestries, aside from Australian, New \nZealander and British/Irish, were German, Italian, Chinese, Dutch, American, Greek, and Indian.  With \nthe exception of American ancestry, these results are in keeping with those from the 2006 Australian \nCensus showing these six ancestries (Italian, German, Chinese, Greek, Dutch and Indian – order \naccording to Census results) as having the highest number of responses after Australian and \nBritish/Irish (ABS, 2006).  Eleven people (0.6%) self-identified as Indigenous Australians.  As a group, \nthese Australians were underrepresented in the current sample.  As at 30 June 2006, Australia’s \nIndigenous population was estimated to be 2.5% of the total population (ABS).  Although not \nincluded in Table 2 below, 21 participants (1.1%) reported a Jewish ancestry, with this likely to be \ndue to the close association between Jewish religion and ethnicity.  All participants reported being an \nAustralian citizen or permanent resident of Australia as part of the eligibility requirement of the \nsurvey.  Close to three-quarters (74.6%) reported that they had lived in Australia all their lives, with \nthe average duration for those who had not being 22.6 years (median = 21 years). \nTable 2. \n \nCultural ancestry (up to two ancestries) \n   N            %  \nAnglo/Australian/British Irish descent 1590 79.8  \nAustralian Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander 11 0.6  \nEast Asian \nChinese \n(Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Taiwanese) \n \n41 \n7 \n2.4 \n \n \nEastern and South-eastern European  \nPolish \nRussian \nCroatian \nHungarian \nCzech \nSerbian \nOther \n \n13 \n11 \n10 \n7 \n6 \n4 \n21 \n3.6 \n \n \nLatin American/Caribbean 10 0.5  \nMiddle Eastern \nLebanese \nIsraeli \nOther \n \n8 \n6 \n7 \n1.1  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     11 \n \nNorth American \nAmerican (USA) \nCanadian \nNative American \n \n26 \n10 \n5 \n2.1  \nNorthern European-Nordic (Danish, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian) 16 0.8  \nOther Oceania  \nNew Zealander \nMaori \n(Papua New Guinean, South Pacific Islander) \n \n54 \n6 \n4 \n  3.2  \nSouth African 14 0.7  \nSouth Asian \nIndian \nSri Lankan \nPakistani \n \n20 \n7 \n4 \n1.6  \nSoutheast Asian  \nFilipino \nMalay \nIndonesian \n(Singaporean, Vietnamese, Other) \n \n14 \n7 \n5 \n8 \n1.7  \nSouthern European \nItalian \nGreek \nMaltese \nSpanish \nPortuguese \n \n48 \n25 \n11 \n10 \n6 \n5.0  \nWestern European \nGerman \nDutch \nFrench \nAustrian \nSwiss \nOther \n \n55 \n32 \n10 \n8 \n5 \n2 \n5.6  \nOther  \nEuropean unspecified  \nOther African \n \n8 \n7 \n0.8  \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     12 \n \n1.3 Age \nThe mean age of this sample was 35.8 years (standard deviation 12.4) with a median age of 34 years.  \nAges ranged from 18 to 82 years.  Of the 81 participants in the ’60 plus’ age group, 17 were aged 70-\n82.  The mean ages according to gender identity were 35.4 for female, 36.8 for male, and 30.0 for \ngender different participants.  Table 3 below indicates the numbers and percentages of participants \nby age group and according to gender identity (for description of ‘gender identity’, (see section. 2.1). \nTable 3. \n \nNumbers and percentages of participants according to age group and gender identity \n \n         N \n               % \nof total % female % male \n% gender \ndifferent \n \n18 - 19 121  6.0 51.2 43.8 5.0  \n20 - 29 634  31.2 53.9 42.3 3.8  \n30 - 39 537 26.5 62.0 35.9 2.1  \n40 - 49  441 21.7 56.7 42.4 0.9  \n50 - 59 215 10.6 51.2 47.9 0.9  \n60 + (60-82) 81 4.0 33.3 66.7 0.0  \nTotal N = 2029.  Three participants (1 female, 2 male) did not provide their age. \n \n1.4 Education and Employment \nParticipants were asked to select their highest level of education completed (see Table 4).  Three \nparticipants did not specify their current level of education leaving a total of 2029 respondents for \nthis measure.  Consistent with research findings involving sexual-minority individuals both overseas \n(e.g., Cochran & Mays, 2009; Kurdek, 2008) and in Australia, the sample was highly educated when \ncompared with the general population.  For example, the Australian Private Lives GLBTI survey \nconducted in 2005, found 50.7% of participants reported having a university degree (Pitts, Smith, \nMitchell, & Patel, 2006).  In the current survey, 60.8% of participants reported having a Bachelor \ndegree or above compared with 23% of the Australian population in general (ABS, 2009b).  The \npercentage of people with university degrees in Australia has increased over recent years (ABS, \n2009b) which may account for some of the discrepancy between the findings from the earlier and \ncurrent Australian GLBTI surveys.  It is also acknowledged that participants tend to be of higher \neducation in survey research in general (Kaye & Johnson, 1999).  The main issue, however, is being \nable to determine how representative this higher level of education status is of the sexual-minority \npopulation is extremely difficult, given the lack of a description of this group in large population-\nbased studies and the stigma associated with reporting a sexual-minority status (Meyer & Wilson, \n2009).    \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     13 \n \nTable 4. \n \nNumbers and percentages for highest level of education completed \n     N                %  \nLess than Year 10 27  1.3  \nYear 10 Certificate 78  3.8  \nYear 12 Certificate 358 17.6  \nDiploma/Trade Certificate  332 16.4  \nUndergraduate university degree  759  37.4  \nPostgraduate university diploma/degree   475   23.4  \nTotal N = 2029 (three participants did not specify their education level). \n \nFor current employment status, participants were able to select multiple responses.  The \npercentages in Table 5 below, therefore, provide a total over 100%.  When taking into account \nmultiple responses (e.g., a person who selected both full-time employment and being self-employed \nis counted only once as employed), 78.9% of the sample reported being employed.  The employment \nrate for those not in full-time studies or retirement was 92.8%.  Please note that the figures for \ncurrently ‘not in paid employment’ are not to be interpreted as ‘unemployed’.  Of the total sample, \n27% reported currently being a student.  According to a 2009 report from the Australian Bureau of \nStatistics, 19% of the Australian population aged 15-64 was enrolled in a course of study (ABS).  As \nthe current survey did not include individuals under 18, who as a group are more likely to be \nstudents, the discrepancy is likely to be even greater.  However, the number of students in this \nsurvey is in keeping with the relatively high level of education of the sample. \nTable 5. \n \nNumbers and percentages for current work status \n     N                %  \nFull-time student 376 18.5   \nPart-time student 173  8.5  \nFull-time employment 1044 51.4  \nPart-time employment  404 19.9  \nSelf-employed  194 9.5  \nNot in paid employment (incl.

For this sample, 19% (n = 385) selected ‘yes’, 81% (n = \n1646) selected ‘no’ and one person did not respond.  In the Australian Private Lives GLBTI survey \nconducted in 2005, close to 71% reported having no “current religion” (Pitts et al., 2006).  The slightly \nhigher figures found for the current survey may be due to the different wording of the question \nbetween the two surveys.  Considering oneself to be non-religious and to have no current religion, \nmight not be interpreted as being one and the same.  For example, some people may retain a strong \nidentity with a particular religion, due to the association with their school years, family background \nand/or ethnicity, but may not necessarily believe in the teachings of that religion.  Importantly, \n41.9% of participants reported that religion (including the religious beliefs of others) plays a role in \ntheir decisions to disclose their sexuality.  Findings on religion as an influence on disclosure are \ndiscussed in Chapter 4. \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     15 \n \n2. Biological Sex, Gender Identity and Sexual Attraction \n2.1 Sex, Gender Identity and Sexual Identity \nParticipants were first asked to select their biological sex as defined at birth.  Of the sample, 56.8%   \n(n = 1154) selected female, 43.1% (n = 875) selected male and 0.1% (n = 3) selected intersex.  Four \nintersex individuals reported that they were defined as male at birth, resulting in a total of seven \nintersex participants.  Five of these participants reported a female gender identity and two reported \na male gender identity.  As ‘intersex’ is not a gender identity, and many are not defined as such at \nbirth, it is possible that larger numbers of intersex individuals participated in this survey.  Some may \nhave reported a female, male or gender different identity without also indicating that they were \nintersex.  Percentages in relation to gender identity are provided in Table 6 below.  The most \nfrequently described identity for those who selected the ‘Other’ option was ‘gender queer’.  For ease \nof interpretation, the ‘Gender Different’ and ‘Other’ response categories were combined to form a \nsingle category (‘Gender Different’) to represent those who did not indicate a male or female \nidentity.  When examining the numbers of transgender, transsexual, intersex, and gender different \nparticipants, it is important to keep in mind that this survey was not open to all sexual minority \nindividuals but only those who identified as same-sex attracted.  This is likely to have reduced the \nparticipation of the already proportionately smaller number of transgender, transsexual and intersex \npeople in the sexual-minority population.  It is also acknowledged that the term ‘same-sex attracted’, \nby definition, can complicate matters for those whose gender identities and biological sex fall outside \nof the binary definitions imposed by society.   \nTable 6. \n \nCurrent gender identity \n     N                %  \nFemale 1107 54.5   \nTransgender/Transsexual - Female 11  .5  \nIntersex - Female 5 .3  \nGender Different - Female 2 .1  \nTotal Female 1125 55.4  \n    \nMale 851 41.9  \nTransgender/Transsexual - Male 7  .3    \nIntersex - Male 2 .1  \nTotal Male 860 42.3  \n    \nGender Different 26 1.3  \nOther (e.g., gender queer) 21 1.0  \nTotal Gender Different (incl.

The most frequent responses for the \ntotal sample were gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and no label, in that order.  Table 7 below lists the \nnumbers and percentages for sexual identity for the total sample and provides a separate breakdown \nby gender identity category.  Consistent with research suggesting greater fluidity for female sexuality \nand that females tend to be less ‘category specific’ (e.g., Diamond, 2003;2008), larger percentages of \nthose identifying as female, than male, nominated the terms bisexual, queer or no label.  The terms \nqueer and bisexual were also nominated by a larger percent of gender different participants of \nwhom 83% reported being defined as biologically female at birth.  The most frequent description of \nsexual identity under the ‘Other’ category was ‘pansexual’.  Eight participants (7 female, 1 male), \nwho identified as heterosexual, reported that they also had sexual and/or romantic attractions \ntowards members of the same sex.   \nTable 7. \n \nSexual identity by gender identity category \nGender Identity           \n                \n         Female \n Female  \n        Male  Gender Diff \nBiological Sex  \n(as defined at birth) \n \n \n \n(defined at birth) \n      \n 98.4% F \n \n \n      99.0% M \n         \n      83.0% F \n                          \n Total Sample    \nSexual Identity     N     %        N           %         \n% \n         N            %            \n% \n  N      %                                            \n% Gay 824 40.6 51 4.5 772 89.8 1 2.1 \nLesbian 791 38.9 780 69.3 1 0.1 10 21.3 \nBisexual 167 8.2 130 11.6 30 3.5 7 14.9 \nQueer 116 5.7 68 6.0 26 3.0 22 46.8 \nHeterosexual/Straight 8 0.4 7 0.6 1 0.1 0 0.0 \nNo label 74 3.6 54 4.8 18 2.1 2 4.3 \nNot sure 16 0.8 15 1.3 0 0.0 1 2.1 \nOther (e.g., pansexual) 36 1.8 20 1.8 12 1.4 4 8.5 \nTotal N = 2032, F = female, M = male \n2.1.1 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \nResearch findings for transgender, transsexual and intersex participants are often obscured due to \ntheir relatively small numbers.  Therefore, and only where appropriate, figures are provided \nseparately for these participants to provide greater visibility.  However, results will also always be \nincluded in data presented for the general sample.  Table 8 provides the numbers for the reported \nsexual identity of these participants.  As noted earlier, all transgender/transsexual and intersex \nparticipants reported having same-sex attractions, as part of the eligibility requirement of this \nsurvey.  This is likely to explain their smaller representation, as well as the smaller percentages \nreporting a heterosexual identity, when compared with the Australian Private Lives GLBTI survey \n(Pitts et al., 2006) conducted in 2005. For this earlier survey, 14% of these individuals reported a \nheterosexual identity compared with 0.5% for the current survey.  However, consistent with the \nPrivate Lives survey, the most frequent response for transgender/transsexual females was ‘lesbian’ \nand for transgender/transsexual males was ‘queer’.  Importantly, the small numbers of transgender, \ntranssexual and intersex participants in both surveys make it difficult to draw any conclusions on the \nrepresentativeness of the findings.  Nonetheless, highlighting these responses is important in order \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     17 \n \nto create greater visibility, show the diversity within these groups, and identify consistencies \nbetween earlier and future research. \nTable 8. \n \nSexual identity of transgender, transsexual and intersex participants \n   Trans-F (11)     Trans-M (7)   Intersex-F (5)   Intersex-M (2)  \nSexual Identity                              \nGay 0 0 0 0 \nLesbian 5 0 2 0 \nBisexual 2 1 2 1 \nQueer 1 5 0 1 \nHeterosexual/Straight 1 0 0 0 \nNo label 0 1 0 0 \nNot sure 0 0 0 0 \nOther  2 0 1 0 \nF = female, M = male \n \n2.2 Sexual and Romantic Attraction \nParticipants were invited to select the extent to which they felt sexually and romantically attracted to \neither males or females.  It is acknowledged that the modified version of the Kinsey Scale (Kinsey, \nPomeroy, & Martin, 1948) used for these questions, and which is utilised extensively in research \nrelating to same-sex attractions, is not inclusive of non-binary gender identities and intersex.  The \noption to select attracted to ‘equally males and females’ on the mid-point of the scale is not one and \nthe same as selecting an attraction to people who are biologically intersex or biologically either male \nor female but gender identify as another, or being attracted to people who identify as gender \ndifferent.  Although very few people did not respond to these questions (none of whom reported \nbeing transgender, transsexual, gender different or intersex), some participants commented that \nthey felt quite constrained by the strictly binary options.  Sexual and romantic attraction responses \nfor the three gender identity groups are provided in Figures 2, 3 and 4.  Please note that the figures \nfor the two types of attractions do not necessarily represent the same participants at any given point \non the scale.  For example, a person identifying as male and selecting a romantic attraction to ‘only \nfemales’ may have also selected a sexual attraction to ‘equally males and females’.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     18 \n \n72.0\n18.9\n3.1 3.6\n1.2 1.1 0.2\n76.4\n18.9\n2.3 1.1 0.6 0.5 0.2\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nonly males mainly \nmales\nslightly \nmore \nmales\nequally \nmales & \nfemales\nslightly \nmore \nfemales\nmainly \nfemales\nonly \nfemales\nRomantic Attraction Sexual Attraction\n0.2\n1.6 2.6\n6.1 5.8\n24.0\n59.8\n0.2 0.7\n2.9 4.9\n8.0\n33.5\n49.9\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nonly males mainly \nmales\nslightly \nmore \nmales\nequally \nmales & \nfemales\nslightly \nmore \nfemales\nmainly \nfemales\nonly \nfemales\nn\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\no\nf\nr\ne\ns\np\no\nn\nd\ne\nn\nt\ns\nPartic\nRomantic Attraction Sexual Attraction\nFigure 2. \n \nSexual and romantic attraction towards others for participants identifying as male (N = 854) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. \n \nSexual and romantic attraction towards others for participants identifying as female (N = 1123)\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     19 \n \n2.1 4.3\n8.5\n17.0\n8.5\n34.0\n25.5\n4.3 6.4 4.3\n10.6\n25.5\n34.0\n14.9\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nonly males mainly \nmales\nslightly \nmore \nmales\nequally \nmales & \nfemales\nslightly \nmore \nfemales\nmainly \nfemales\nonly \nfemales\nRomantic Attraction Sexual Attraction\nFigure 4. \n \nSexual and romantic attraction towards others for participants identifying as gender different       \n(N = 47))  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe large majority of participants identifying as male reported being sexually attracted exclusively or \npredominantly (95.3%) to males, as well as romantically attracted exclusively or predominately (91%) \nto males.  Comparably, the large majority of participants identifying as female reported being \nsexually attracted exclusively or predominantly (83.4%) to females, as well as romantically attracted \nexclusively or predominantly (83.8%) to females.  Responses on the attraction scales were more \nevenly distributed for participants identifying as gender different, although the majority reported \nattraction on the ‘female’ side of the scales.  Consistent with prior research (e.g., Pitts et al., 2006), \nthose who identified as male were significantly more likely than those who identified as female to \nreport being exclusively attracted to members of the same sex.  More interestingly, a significantly \nlarger number of those who identified as female reported a romantic attraction exclusively to \nfemales when compared with a sexual attraction exclusively to females (see Figure 3).  Although the \nstatistical significance was less pronounced for those who identified as male, the pattern was \nreversed with significantly larger numbers having reported a sexual attraction exclusively to males \ncompared with a romantic attraction exclusively to males (see Figure 2).  In the case of gender \ndifferent participants, larger numbers reported being romantically attracted exclusively to females \nthan sexually attracted exclusively to females (see Figure 4).  Although this was the same pattern \nfound for those who identified as female, the numbers for this group were comparatively small with \nthis difference not statistically significant.  \n2.2.1 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \nAs well as being included in the findings for the general sample above, attraction responses relating \nto transgender, transsexual and intersex participants are provided separately.  For this survey, the \nmajority of female transgender/transsexual participants reported being sexually attracted exclusively \nor predominantly (63.6%) to females and romantically attracted exclusively or predominantly (54.6%) \nto females.  Three participants (27.3%) reported an equal attraction to males and females for both \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     20 \n \nromantic and sexual attraction.  The majority of male transgender/transsexual participants reported \nbeing sexually attracted exclusively or predominantly (54.2%) to males with one participant (14.3%) \nreporting a sexual attraction to mainly females and the remaining two participants an attraction \nbetween these scale points.  On the other hand, the numbers for romantic attraction for \ntransgender/transsexual males tended to be polarised with 42.9% reporting being romantically \nattracted exclusively or predominantly to males and an equal 42.9% being romantically attracted \npredominantly to females.  The remainder responded between these scale points.  For both sexual \nand romantic attraction, 100% of intersex participants reported being mainly or exclusively attracted \nto individuals of the gender to which they identified.  \n2.3 Sexual vs. Romantic Attractions \nOverall, the findings from these measures indicate that sexual and romantic attractions are not \nnecessarily consistent.  From the total sample, close to a third of participants (29.9%) indicated a \ndifference between the extent to which they felt romantically attracted and the extent to which they \nfelt sexually attracted to males and/or females.  Further, only 1.2% of the sample indicated an equal \nattraction to males and females when it came to both romantic and sexual attraction (for \ninterpretation of percentages provided in Figures 2, 3, & 4, (see section 2.2).  This suggests that even \nfor people who identify as bisexual, it is rarely a simple case of equal attraction to men and women.  \nDistinguishing between the two types of attraction also allowed a person to clarify if they were \nsexually attracted to neither males nor females but did have romantic attractions or vice versa.   \nAlthough the numbers were small, some participants clarified in the comment box provided for each \nscale that they had only sexual attractions or only romantic attractions to people (e.g., “I’m \nromantically attracted...but not sexually attracted to [anyone]”). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     21 \n \n3. Awareness and First Disclosure of Sexuality \n3.1 Age First Aware \nParticipants were first asked to recall at what age they first became aware of sexual and/or romantic \nattractions to someone of the same sex.  Due to the complexity of this question, particularly for \npeople who are transgender, transsexual or intersex, participants were invited to describe their \nexperiences if they preferred.  The data provided in response to this question are likely to be \nimprecise for a number of reasons.  Like all retrospective data, it relies on the accuracy of memory.  \nFurther, it is difficult to distinguish between the age at which a person realises at the time they have \ncertain attractions to others and the age at which they now realise they had these attractions.  \nAnother issue is that what defines same-sex attractions for one person may be different for another.  \nFor some participants, and consistent with research in this area (e.g., Savin-Williams, 2005), the \nearliest memory was one of just feeling different from one’s peers.  Despite the nature of this \nquestion, the majority of participants were able to provide a specific age.  In instances where a \nrelatively small range in age was given, the figures were averaged (e.g., “13-14” to 13.5; “15-17” to \n16).  Where the range provided was wider than three years (e.g., “21-24, “my teens”) or no age was \nmade clear, the response was not included for this particular analysis, resulting in a reduction of 9.8% \nof the sample.  Results for ‘age aware’ for the three gender identity groups are provided in Table 9 \nand Figure 5. \n3.2 Age Sure \nA second question asked participants at what age they felt sure within themselves that they had \nsame-sex attractions.  Perhaps as a result of this question being a little less open to distortion than \nthe first, the sample size was reduced (based on criteria described above) by only 4.7% compared \nwith 9.8% for the question on first awareness.  For some participants the inability to provide a \nprecise age was not due to memory issues but rather that they felt awareness was a subtle process, \nor was difficult to pinpoint, with there being no defining age at which they felt sure (e.g., “I don’t \nthink it was a defined point, more a growing awareness since childhood”, “Sexuality is such a fluid \nthing”).  Importantly, even for those who made it clear that they felt sure about their attractions at a \ncertain age, several were not ‘self-accepting’ of their attractions at the time (e.g., “I felt \nsure...although I tried to avert it or deny it”, “around 15...but denied it till around 17/18”).  The \nfindings for ‘age sure’ of same-sex attractions are provided for the three gender identity groups in \nTable 9 and Figure 5. \n3.3 Age of First Disclosure  \nA third question asked participants at what age they first disclosed to others, including those with \nsimilar attractions, that they were same-sex attracted.   A separate response option was provided for \nthose who had never told anyone, with 23 participants (1.1%) reporting that this was the case.  Of \nthe remaining sample of 2,009, 0.6% was not included in this particular analysis based on the criteria \nstated in paragraph one above (i.e., the age range provided did not exceed 3 years).

For the reported age of a person’s \nfirst disclosure of their sexuality to anyone, those who identified as male were found to be \nsignificantly younger than those who identified as female.  Further, participants who identified as \ngender different were significantly younger for age of first disclosure than both these groups.  \nComparisons were also made between the time a person became sure of their sexuality and the time \nit took to disclose their sexuality.  Although males, as a group, were sure of their attractions before \nfemales, they took significantly more time on average to disclose these attractions.  Female and \ngender different participants disclosed around one year after they felt sure of their sexuality, \nwhereas for males the average was three and a half years.  Although sexual minorities in general can \nexperience negative reactions in relation to their sexuality, research has found higher levels of \nprejudice towards gay men from other men than towards lesbians from other women (Herek, 2000).  \nAdditionally, the Writing Themselves in Again national survey, involving sexual-minority youth in \nAustralia, found that although both males and females reported abuse in relation to their sexuality, \nyoung males were more likely to state that they were targets of this abuse (Hillier, Turner, & \nMitchell, 2005).  As such, adolescent males, although sure of their same-sex attractions at younger \nages, may, out of fear of these negative repercussions, deliberate for longer over when to first \ndisclose their feelings when compared with females.  Another possibility is that by the time females \nare sure of their sexuality they have, on average, reached a more mature age and may therefore feel \nmore confident in disclosing soon after.   \nAlthough findings discussed above are based on the average ages of participants according to \ngender, it is important to note that both male and female participants who were most senior in this \nsurvey (i.e., 60 years of age or over) did not disclose their same-sex attractions, on average, until \ntheir early thirties (30.1 yrs for males and 32.6 yrs for females).  Additionally, a quarter of the males \nand females in this 60+ age group did not disclose for the first time until their 40s, 50s, or 60s.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     24 \n \n3.4 Gender Differences Based on Age Cohort \nTo provide a more meaningful interpretation of the findings for awareness and disclosure of sexuality \nbased on gender identity, participants were grouped into one of three age cohorts (under 25, 25-34, \nand 35 or older2).  As can be seen in Figure 6 (A, B and C), gender differences were less pronounced \nfor younger cohorts relative to older with this mainly attributed to differences of those who \nidentified as female.  Although results clearly indicated differences between the genders, \ninterpreting these findings in relation to age is restricted by the fact that the data do not allow for \ncomparisons between similar age groups at different periods in time (e.g., youth in the 1980s with \nthe youth of today).  For example, the greater difference among females between cohorts may be \ndue to the possibility that female sexuality, which is argued to be more ‘fluid’ relative to male \n(Baumeister, 2000), is likely to be influenced to a greater extent by the social conditions of the day \n(e.g., Udry, Talbert, & Morris, 1986).  Longitudinal research, however, also supports the possibility \nthat females, in their encounters with different relationships and situations, are likely to become \nmore aware of the fluidity of their sexuality as time goes by (Diamond, 2008).  The findings discussed \nbelow may be a reflection of both factors.   \nWith the exception of the oldest cohort of females, awareness of same-sex attractions tended to \noccur between the ages of 11 ½ and 13½.  On average, females 35 years of age and over reported \nbecoming aware in their mid-teens, and for certain age groups within this cohort the average was \nnot until the late teens or early twenties.  For example, females aged 50-59 generally reporting \nbecoming aware of their same-sex attractions at 19 years of age, and those 60 years, and over, at \naround 23 years of age.  For their male counterparts, however, the ages were 12 ½ years and 14 \nyears respectively (averages are not provided for gender different participants in this instance, due to \nthe fact there were only two gender different individuals within these ages).    \nFemales in the oldest cohort reported, on average, being sure of their same-sex  attractions close to \n7 ½ years later than females in the youngest cohort, whereas it was around 3 years later for the \noldest cohort of males and 4 years later for the oldest cohort of gender different participants, when \ncompared with their equivalent counterparts.  When comparing age of first disclosure between the \nyoungest and oldest cohorts within each gender group, females in the oldest cohort reported this \noccurring just over 8 ½ years later, whereas for males and gender different participants in the same \nage group it was 6 years later and 3 ½ years later respectively. \nFor those under the age of 25 (Figure 6C), there were no significant differences between the ages in \nwhich females, males and gender different participants first disclosed their same-sex attractions.  \nHowever, females, on average, were still significantly older (although only by one year) when first \naware and sure of their sexuality, compared with males.  Also consistent with the results for the total \nsample, males, although sure of their attractions before females, took significantly more time on \naverage to disclose these attractions.  These young female participants disclosed approximately 4 \nmonths after feeling sure, whereas young male participants disclosed around one and a half years \nlater.  The number of gender different participants for this reduced sample of under 25 year olds is \nrelatively small limiting the interpretation of any statistical comparisons (for numbers see Table 10). \n                                                          \n2\n The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies youth as being from 15-24 years of age, young people generally as being up to \nthe age of 34, and those 35 and older as no longer young adults (ABS, 2009a; 2010).  Analyses comparing gender \ndifferences between the six age groups of the survey (i.e., 18-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+) revealed the same \npattern of results for awareness and disclosure of sexuality as those found for the three main age cohorts.  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     25 \n \nF = 16.2\nF = 23.7\nM = 23.2\nM = 12\nM = 18.2\nGD = 20.2\nGD = 13.2\nGD = 19.7\nF = 25.2\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nage aware                              \n(N=886)\nage sure                                             \n(N=940)\nage 1st disclosure                                              \n(N=970)\nM\nea\nn\n a\nge\n o\nf \naw\nar\nen\nes\ns \nan\nd\n \nd\nis\ncl\no\nsu\nre\n(A) 35 + age group\nFemale (F) Male (M) Gender Different (GD)\nF =13.4\nF = 18.7\nM = 18.6\nM = 11.5 M = 16.0\nGD =17.4\nGD = 12\nGD = 16.3\nF =19.5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nage aware                              \n(N=558)\nage sure                                             \n(N=586)\nage 1st disclosure                                              \n(N=603)M\nea\nn\n a\nge\n o\nf \naw\nar\nen\nes\ns \nan\nd\n d\nis\ncl\no\nsu\nre\n(B) 25-34 age group\nFemale (F) Male (M) Gender Different (GD)\nF =13\nF =16.3\nGD=16.6M =12 M =15.4\nM=17\nGD=11.9 GD=15.6\nF =16.6\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nage aware                              \n(N=385)\nage sure                                             \n(N=407)\nage 1st disclosure                                              \n(N=421)\nM\nea\nn\n a\nge\n o\nf \naw\nar\nen\nes\ns \nan\nd\n \nd\nis\ncl\no\nsu\nre\n(C) < 25 age group\nFemale (F) Male (M) Gender Different (GD)\nFigure 6 (A, B and C). \n \nMean ages by gender identity, for age first aware, age sure and age of first disclosure of same-sex \nattractions according to age cohort \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     26 \n \nTable 10. \n \nNumbers of participants corresponding to data presented in Figure 6 for gender differences by \ncohort, for age aware, age sure and age of first disclosure of same-sex attractions \n      N Age Aware                   N Age Sure N 1\nst Disclosure  \n<25 yrs      \n Female 185 199 206  \n Male 183 192 197  \n Gender different 17 16 18  \n25 – 34 yrs      \n Female 338 358 369  \n Male 205 214 219  \n Gender different 15 14 15  \n35 + yrs       \n Female 470 512 532  \n Male 405 416 425  \n Gender different 11 12 13  \nNote:  The aware, sure, and disclosure questions were presented to all participants, with numbers \nvarying due to number of invalid responses (refer to sections 3.1 – 3.3 for clarification).  \n \n3.5 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \nParticipants who specifically selected the transgender, transsexual or intersex response options in \nthis survey reported either a male or female identity.  They are, therefore, included in the findings for \nthese two larger groups presented previously.  It is, nonetheless, important to acknowledge the very \ndifferent experiences of these individuals.  As discussed earlier in this report, the term ‘same-sex \nattracted’, by definition, can be problematic for those whose biological sex and/or gender identity do \nnot adhere to the assumptions that all people are born either strictly male or female and that one’s \nsex defined at birth is consistent with a person’s gender identity.  Although feelings of attraction to \ncertain others may remain stable over time, having to classify these as either same-sex or different-\nsex attractions or identify at what stage they classify as one or the other, for those who transition, is \nfar from straightforward.  It is not surprising, therefore, that several of these participants did not \nprovide a precise age for the awareness and first disclosure questions discussed above.  Nonetheless, \nnearly all participants attempted to explain their unique experiences and how it related to their sex \ndefined at birth, their current gender identity and/or time of transitioning.  Importantly, all \ntransgender, transsexual and intersex participants considered themselves eligible for this survey, \ngiven the ‘same-sex attracted’ requirement.  As noted before, people who are transgender, \ntranssexual or intersex may also identify as heterosexual (e.g., Pitts et al., 2006).  \n \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     27 \n \n4. Ongoing Disclosure of Sexuality \nIn contrast to the experience of disclosing one’s sexuality for the very first time, disclosure of sexual \nattractions can be an ongoing process for people in general.  Although the remark “Heterosexuals \ndon’t go around disclosing their sexuality, so why should I/they” is not uncommon, men who are \nattracted to women and women who are attracted to men frequently disclose the nature of their \nrelationships through their everyday conversations.  Although it is unlikely that anyone with only \n‘different-sex’ attractions would explicitly state that they were “heterosexual”, they still convey a \ndisclosure message through statements like “I need to hurry up, my wife is picking me up in an hour” \nor “my boyfriend makes the best chocolate cake”.  The same form of indirect disclosure is obviously \nalso available to those with same-sex attractions.  The difference is that, for this latter group, the \nconsequences of not remaining gender neutral in such conversations are less clear.   \n4.1 Experimental Research \nA series of experimental studies conducted at The University of Queensland between 2005 and 2008 \naimed to identify the reactions of heterosexual participants when confronted by a person ‘coming \nout’ in the indirect manner described above.  Male and female stage actors, who were in reality \nsame-sex attracted, disclosed their sexuality to a participant of their own sex either very early during \ntheir interaction or much later.  Findings showed that both male and female heterosexual \nparticipants (total number over three years = 461) sat closer to the same-sex attracted person, liked \nthe person more, shared more about themselves with this person, reported that they were more \nlikely to be willing to introduce this person to their friends and were happier about meeting this \nperson in the future, when the same-sex attracted person disclosed earlier rather than later (Dane, \nMasser, MacDonald, & Duck, 2010).  Importantly, the form of disclosure used in this research was \none of low risk and was simply conducive to extending one’s friendship networks. \n4.2 Timing of Disclosure – Survey Scenarios \nThe survey included a set of scenarios, in order to identify to what extent same-sex attracted people \nare likely to use various disclosure strategies and at what stage of getting to know someone assumed \nto be heterosexual they are more likely to use these.  These scenarios, like the experiments \ndescribed above, involved a relatively low risk situation (e.g., not related to work or family) at a social \nevent in which an equal number of men and women were in attendance.  Each scenario described \nthe same event, however, the people to whom disclosure was being considered appeared a) possibly \nopen-minded, b) possibly somewhat conservative or c) their stance was not clear.  The order in which \nparticipants were presented with the three scenarios in the survey was randomised.  The wording of \nthe scenarios and the response options that followed are provided on the following page.  \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     28 \n \nScenario A (possibly positive reaction) \n“You have been invited to a casual social gathering, unrelated to work, at which there are around 30 people (an \nequal mixture of men and women) in attendance.  You are not familiar with most of these people, however, you \nassume you are in ‘straight’ company.  Although these people are new to you, it is likely that you will have the \nopportunity to meet them again.  At a small outdoor table, you find yourself having a chat with a man and a \nwoman who arrived together.  You do not know how these people feel about same-sex sexuality.  However, \nsomething about them gives you a hint that they may be open minded about things in general.  This may be \nsomething about their appearance, body language or something they have said on another topic.  \nNonetheless, you can’t be sure about their feelings on same-sex sexuality.  If you have a same-sex partner, \nimagine he or she is also at this event.  If you do not currently have a same-sex partner, imagine a friend (male \nor female) is also at this event. \nScenario B (possibly negative reaction) \nThe same wording as Scenario A above with the wording in bold changed to “However, something about them \ngives you a hint that they may be a little conservative (i.e., traditional) in their thinking on some issues.  This \nmay be something about their appearance, body language or something they have said on another topic.” \nScenario C (reaction not clear) \nThe same wording as Scenario A above with the wording in bold changed to “Nothing about their appearance, \nbody language or their conversation provides any clue as to how they may feel.” with the redundant \nsentence immediately following removed. \nThe Response Options  \nThe same answer options were provided after each randomly ordered scenario and are detailed \nbelow. \nQ. For the hypothetical situation above, which of the responses below most closely describes how \nyou think you would most likely react given your current circumstances (e.g., single, partnered,  \nnot ‘out’, partner not ‘out’).  Note: Disclosure means making it known in some way that you are same-sex \nattracted (e.g., introduce a partner, disclose the name of a past or present partner or offer some other \ninformation that implies you are same-sex attracted). \no I don’t think I would disclose to this man and woman now or in the foreseeable future ( = 1) \no I would most probably wait to see if I got to know this man and woman better on another occasion \nbefore deciding whether to disclose ( = 2) \no I would most probably disclose to this man and woman at this first meeting but only if it seemed \nrelevant to the topic of the conversation ( = 3) \no I would most probably disclose to this man and woman at this first meeting regardless of the topic of \nthe conversation (e.g. make a point of mentioning/introducing a partner or offering some other \ninformation to make it clear) ( = 4) \n  \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     29 \n \n3.6\n11.9\n6.2\n16.4\n30.0\n25.3\n62.2\n46.5\n56.5\n17.7\n11.6 12.0\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\nscenario A                                           \n(possibly positive)\nscenario B                           \n(possibly negative)\nscenario C                               \n(unclear)\nNot likely at all\nPerhaps later when better \nacquainted\nNow but only if relevant to the \nconversation\nNow regardless\nFigure 7.  \n \nPercentages of participants for likelihood of ‘coming out’ for possibly positive (A), possibly \nnegative (B) and unclear (C) reactions to disclosure based on social interaction scenarios \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.3 Overall Findings and in Relation to Well-Being and Stigma \nAs expected, participants were significantly less likely to ‘come out’ when the people to whom they \nwere considering disclosing were presented in the scenarios as being possibly somewhat \nconservative (scenario B) compared with possibly open-minded3 (scenario A) or their stance was \nunclear (scenario C).  Nonetheless, even for the potentially least favourable situation (scenario B) a \nmajority (58.1%) still indicated that they would most likely disclose ‘now’ (46.5% conditional and \n11.6% regardless).  The percentages for each of these scenarios are provided in Figure 7 above.  As \nwas also expected, higher levels of well-being and lower perceptions of stigma were associated with \na greater likelihood of ‘coming out’ overall.  Participants’ scores on well-being and perceived stigma \nare discussed further in Chapter 10.  \n4.4 Regular Partner and Partner ‘Disclosure Comfort’ Similarity \nThis research was also interested in the association between a person’s relationship status and their \nlikelihood of ‘coming out’ to others.  As discussed earlier, it is possible for a person to indirectly \ndisclose their sexuality in much the same way heterosexual individuals4 disclose the nature of their \nrelationships by simply referring to their partners in their everyday conversations.  For this reason, it \n                                                          \n3\n Although being open-minded and being conservative are not necessarily mutually exclusive, research has found a \nsignificant relationship between conservatism and less favourable attitudes towards homosexuality (Whitley & Lee, 2000).  \n \n4\n It is acknowledged that simply because a person makes it clear that they are in a relationship with someone of a different \nsex it does not necessarily mean they are heterosexual. However, the same logic is less likely to apply when disclosing a \nrelationship with a person of the same sex (i.e., that they are not nonheterosexual). \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     30 \n \n8.8\n16.6\n25.3\n37.2\n51.1\n39.6\n14.8\n6.6\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\npartnered                                                \n(N=1225)\nnot partnered                                            \n(N=803)\nNot likely at all\nPerhaps later when better \nacquainted\nNow but only if relevant to \nthe conversation\nNow regardless\nwas anticipated that participants who reported currently having a regular partner5 would indicate, on \naverage, a higher likelihood of ‘coming out’ when compared with participants who reported not \ncurrently having a regular partner or were in only casual relationships.  Results showed that this was \nin fact the case.  Perhaps for people who are partnered, referring to their relationships may allow \ndisclosure to feel less awkward (or at least more relevant) in their casual conversations with others.  \nAnother contributing factor may be the level of support offered by the presence of one’s partner \nduring the disclosure process.  Results for being partnered vs. not partnered are provided in Figure 8 \nand those based on similarity to one’s partner in being comfortable about disclosing one’s sexuality \nare provided in Figure 9.  Although findings were significant for the likelihood of disclosure across the \nthree scenarios, for ease of interpretation and presentation, percentages are provided for scenario B \nwhich was presented as being potentially the least favourable for disclosure.  \nFigure 8. \n \nPercentages for likelihood of ‘coming out’ for possibly negative (scenario B) reactions to disclosure \nfor those currently same-sex partnered vs. not \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor scenario B, close to two-thirds (65.9%) of participants who reported having a regular partner \nselected an option to disclose now (51.1% and 14.8%), although for most this depended on its \nrelevance to the conversation.  By contrast, the majority (53.8%) of participants who reported not \ncurrently having a regular partner stated they were not likely to disclose at all or would most \nprobably delay disclosure until another time (16.6% and 37.2%).  Importantly, even when a person’s \nlevel of well-being was taken into account, having a regular partner was still significantly related to a \ngreater likelihood of disclosure for each of the three scenario cases and overall.   \n                                                          \n5\n ‘Regular Partner’ was made distinct from ‘casual relationships only’ and ‘no primary partner but regular sex partners’.  It \nrepresents participants who selected either the ‘Regular partner (living together)’ or the ‘Regular partner (living separately)’ \noptions for the ‘Current Same-Sex Relationship(s)’ question (see section 5.1.1). ‘Regular partner’, in all cases, refers to a \nregular same-sex partner.  A separate question was presented regarding ‘different-sex’ relationships. \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     31 \n \n13.9\n3.7\n31.7\n17.7\n45.2\n56.5\n9.2\n22.1\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\nPartner disclosure comfort \nsimilarity                                      \nLOW\nPartner disclosure comfort \nsimilarity                                               \nHIGH\nNot likely at all\nPerhaps later when better \nacquainted\nNow but only if relevant to the \nconversation\nNow regardless\nAlthough some people may be happy to ‘come out’ to others during casual social interactions, \ndeciding to do so may hinge on their partner’s level of comfort with such disclosure.  As such, this \nresearch also looked at the relationship between partner similarity in relation to comfort with \ndisclosure/sexuality and the likelihood of ‘coming out’ for the three different scenarios.  To assess \n‘perceived partner similarity’ regarding this level of comfort, the survey included a five-item scale \ndevised by Mohr and Fassinger (2006) and asked participants to what extent they agreed or \ndisagreed with the statements.  Examples of these items are “My partner and I are equally \ncomfortable being ‘out’ in public” and “My partner and I are equally comfortable being a same-sex \ncouple” (for more detail on this scale, refer to section 7.3).  The low vs. high categories for partner \ndisclosure similarity (see Figure 9) were based on participants’ responses that were below the \nmedian score and those that were above the median score. \nFigure 9. \n \nPercentages for likelihood of ‘coming out’ for possibly negative (scenario B) reactions to disclosure \nfor low vs. high partner ‘disclosure comfort’ similarity for participants reporting a regular partner \nof the same sex \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResults indicated that although having a regular partner was related to a higher likelihood of ‘coming \nout’ overall, having a partner with a similar level of comfort in disclosing was, not surprisingly, \nrelated to a greater likelihood.  Using scenario B as an example, over three-quarters (78.6%) of \nparticipants, who perceived high levels of similarity with their partners regarding comfort in \ndisclosing, selected an option to disclose ‘now’ (56.5% if relevant and 22.1% regardless) despite the \nprospect of encountering a possibly negative reaction by others (see Figure 10).  For those who \nperceived low levels of similarity, 54.4% selected an option to disclose ‘now’ (45.2% and 9.2%) and \nfor those with no current same-sex partner the numbers were under a majority at 46.2% (39.6% and \n6.6%).  Additionally, when considering the results for partner similarity for disclosure and perceptions \nof how supportive a partner was in general, it was only partner disclosure similarity that was \nsignificantly related to the likelihood of ‘coming out’.    \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     32 \n \n4.4.1 Conclusion \nResearchers have frequently discussed the benefits of ‘coming out’ for personal well-being and in \nrelation to changing societal attitudes (e.g., Herek, 2003).  Further, recent experimental studies, \ninvolving low risk casual encounters, have shown that heterosexual individuals respond more \npositively to such disclosure when it occurs earlier rather than later (Dane et al., 2010).  Overall, the \nmajority of participants for the hypothetical scenarios presented in this survey indicated that they \nwould most likely ‘come out’ during their first encounter to an assumed to be ‘straight’ couple at a \ncasual social gathering.  For some this was if it was relevant to the conversation and for others it was \nregardless.  Interestingly, a majority was found for those partnered even when the situation was \ndepicted as being potentially negative, albeit a low risk casual encounter (scenario B).  Nonetheless, \nand although somewhat intuitive, it is important to acknowledge the additional challenges faced by \nsome individuals.  The findings from this survey suggest that even for those who may wish to ‘come \nout’, this decision may be hampered by their currently single status or a lack of compatibility with \ntheir partner’s level of disclosure comfort.  Although casually introducing or mentioning a partner \nmay facilitate disclosure in much the same way heterosexual individuals convey the nature of their \nrelationships, this option is not always possible for some.  Several participants made it clear in the \naccompanying comment boxes that if they had a partner they would be more inclined to disclose.  \nMany who reported having a partner stated that they would simply discuss or introduce their \npartners.  It is also acknowledged that relationship status and partner disclosure compatibility are \njust two of a myriad of factors that are likely to be associated with decisions to ‘come out’ to others.   \n4.5 Gender Identity and Disclosure \nNo statistical differences were found between participants identifying as male, female or gender \ndifferent for the likelihood of ‘coming out’ to others for the hypothetical scenarios described above.  \nIt is important to keep in mind that the event in the scenarios was described as having an equal \nnumber of men and women in attendance.  Further, the couple to whom ‘coming out’ was to be \nconsidered consisted of a man and a woman.  The rationale for presenting these equal numbers was \nto ensure the scenarios, in terms of sex, were perceived similarly between participants.  Nonetheless, \n‘coming out’ in real life is not likely to always occur when in the company of both men and women.  \nTherefore, participants upon completion of the scenario questions were asked about their \npreferences in relation to disclosing to heterosexual men vs. heterosexual women.  As shown in \nFigure 10 on the following page, the most frequent response for participants, regardless of their \ngender identity, was that it made no difference whether a heterosexual person was male or female \nwhen considering disclosing their sexuality, with the largest number for this equal preference being \nfor participants who identified as female (70.2%).  For those to whom it did make a difference,  the \npercentages overall were higher towards a preference for disclosing to women, with the percentage \nin this case being largest for participants who identified as male (48.8%).  These results are consistent \nwith numerous studies that have found heterosexual men generally hold more negative attitudes \ntowards nonheterosexuals than do heterosexual women, and that this is mainly a consequence of \ntheir negative evaluations of gay men as opposed to lesbians (Kite & Whitley, 2003).  Only in the case \nof gender different participants were the numbers very close to even when it came to a preference \nfor disclosing to either men or women.   \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     33 \n \n0.8 1.3\n6.40.9 3.6\n14.9\n49.4\n70.2\n59.6\n33.9\n18.4\n12.8\n14.9\n6.5 6.4\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nmale                                     \n(N=858)\nfemale                                        \n(N=1122)\ngender different                                \n(N=47)\nMuch more likely men\nSomewhat more likely men\nMakes no difference\nSomewhat more likely women\nMuch more likely women\nFigure 10. \n \nPercentages in relation to participants’ preferences for ‘coming out’ to heterosexual men vs. \nheterosexual women \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.6 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants  \nThe findings for transgender, transsexual and intersex participants for the likelihood of ‘coming out’, \nbased on the three scenarios presented, were in keeping with those of the general sample.  In the \ncase of preferences for ‘coming out’ to either heterosexual men or women, overall the percentages \nrepresenting a preference for disclosing to women were higher compared with the general sample \n(see Table 11).  This is consistent with research suggesting that heterosexual men are more likely \nthan heterosexual women to negatively evaluate those who fundamentally challenge \nheteronormative assumptions about sex and gender identity, and that women appear to be more \nlikely to make some distinction between sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender roles in their \nevaluations (Nagoshi, Adams, Terrell, Hill, Brzuzy, & Nagoshi, 2008). \nTable 11. \n \nNumbers of transgender/transsexual and intersex participants in relation to preferences for \ndisclosing sexuality to heterosexual men vs. heterosexual women. \n Trans-F Trans-M Intersex-F Intersex-M \nPreference for disclosure                           \nMuch more likely men 0 0 0 0 \nSomewhat more likely men 0 0 0 0 \nMakes no difference 5 3 1 1 \nSomewhat more likely women 2 3 1 1 \nMuch more likely women  4 1 3 0 \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     34 \n \n58.1\n10.0\n15.8\n7.9 6.0\n2.2\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\nNo influence rarely sometimes \nbut more \nthan rarely\nabout half of \nthe time\nmost of the \ntime\nalways\n4.7 Religion and Disclosure \nIdentifying as a religious person was not significantly related to a person’s likelihood of ‘coming out’ \nbased on the social interactions described in the three scenarios.  Of the 385 participants in this \nsurvey who stated that they considered themselves to be religious, less than half (48.3%) felt that \nreligion (including the religious beliefs of others) had an influence on their decisions to disclose or \nnot disclose their sexuality in everyday life.  Further, of the 1646 participants who stated that they \ndid not consider themselves to be religious, 40.5% nonetheless felt religion (including the religious \nbeliefs of others) did have an influence on their decisions to disclose or not.  Statistical analyses \nrevealed that it was only the extent of religious influence in everyday life, rather than one’s own \nreligious beliefs, which was significantly related to the likelihood of ‘coming out’ during the social \nencounters depicted in the three hypothetical scenarios.  Specifically, the greater the religious \ninfluence the lower the likelihood of disclosure for all three scenarios, with this association strongest \nfor the ‘possibly negative reaction’ (scenario B) outcome.  Figure 11 shows the percentages of \nparticipants based on the responses for extent of religious influence on disclosure in everyday life.  \nFigure 11. \n \nPercentages of participants in relation to extent of religious influence (including the religious \nbeliefs of others) on decisions to disclose sexuality (N = 2031) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     35 \n \n4.8 Acceptance and Disclosure \nAs past experiences with disclosing one’s sexuality are likely to have some impact on ongoing \ndisclosure, this survey also looked at participants’ perceptions of acceptance from various sectors \nand their association with the likelihood of ‘coming out’ during the social encounters depicted in the \nthree scenarios.  When considering all five areas of acceptance together (i.e., heterosexual friends, \nheterosexual contacts from the wider community, mother, father and siblings), it was perceived \nacceptance from heterosexual friends, contacts from the wider community and from a mother which \nwere significantly related to a person’s likelihood of disclosing in the scenarios.  Of these, a mother’s \nacceptance was the stronger predictor, followed by heterosexual friends.  These findings suggest that \nexperiences of disclosure to close others are, on average, likely to have some ongoing influence on \ndecisions to be relatively upfront, or not, regarding one’s sexuality.  \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     36 \n \n5. Relationships and Recognition \nNOTE:  Findings for the ‘Relationship Recognition’ measures discussed in this chapter were presented \nin an earlier report (Auxiliary Report) which was submitted to the Federal Senate inquiry into the \nMarriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009 (Commonwealth of Australia. Senate Legal and \nConstitutional Affairs Committee, November 9, 2009).  The findings from this earlier report related to \nthe 2,232 participants who completed the ‘Relationship Recognition’ questions presented in the first \nthird of the survey.  Results were found to be consistent between this larger sample and the current \nsample of 2,032 (200 fewer) participants who completed the survey in full.  Nonetheless, it was \ndeemed more appropriate to provide results to the Senate inquiry based on the larger sample, to \nensure the relationship findings were not just representative of people who may have been more \ninclined to complete a lengthy survey.  For comparisons between the results provided in this chapter \nbased on the responses of 2,032 participates with those of the larger sample of 2,232, please refer to \nthe Auxiliary Report in the Appendix. \n5.1 Relationship Background \nOf the current sample, 94.6% reported being in some type of same-sex relationship (including casual) \nat some stage in their lives, with the remaining 5.4% stating that they had never been in any type of \nsame-sex relationship.   \n5.1.1 Current Relationship \nOf the sample, 8.4% reported currently being in a different-sex relationship (worded as ‘opposite-\nsex’ in the questionnaire) and 66% reported currently being in some form of same-sex relationship \n(note: 5.1% reported currently being in a same-sex and different-sex relationship).  The numbers and \npercentages for ‘current same-sex relationship’ are provided in Table 12.  The differences between \nthe findings for the larger sample of 2,232 and the current sample of 2,032 for ‘current relationship’ \nwere minimal with 33.7% vs. 34% having reported not being in a current same-sex relationship of any \ntype and 60.7% vs. 60.4% having reported being in a relationship with a regular partner.   \nTable 12. \n \nType of current same-sex relationship \n N %  \nRegular partner (living together) 919 45.3  \nRegular partner (living apart)   307  15.1  \nNo primary partner but regular sex partners   36   1.8  \nCasual relationship(s) only    77 3.8  \nNot currently in a same-sex relationship   690   34.0  \nTotal N = 2029 (three participants did not respond) \nFigure 12, on the following page, represents the percentages of participants who reported having a \nregular same-sex partner according to participants’ age group and gender identity.

This outcome is consistent \nwith that from the Australian Private Lives GLBTI survey (Pitt et al., 2006), which found higher \npercentages of women (59.5%) than men (42.9%) reported a current same-sex relationship.

Results from the earlier Australian Private Lives GLBTI survey (Pitts et al., \n2006) found 41% of males reported being in their current relationship for 5 years or more compared \nwith 32% of females.  For the current survey, the pattern was similar with 47% of those identifying as \nmale having reported to be in their current relationship for 5 years or more compared with 32.5% of \nfemales.  \nFigure 13. \n \nAverage length of current relationship with regular same-sex partner for participants identifying as \nmale or female \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n* Numbers of female participants in the 60 + age-group were proportionately smaller relative \n    to their representation in other age groups.  For numbers refer to Table 13. \n \nThe findings for females 60 years of age and older should be interpreted with caution, given the \nrelatively small number in this age group.  Further, over half of the female participants in this older \nage group reported a fairly recent relationship of 1 year duration or less.  When considering the \nlongest reported relationship (rather than current) for female participants in this group, the average \nlength was 8.6 years which is consistent with the overall trend.  Thirty participants from the overall \nnumber of those identifying as male and female were not included in the data presented in Figure 13 \nabove.  Of these, 17 did not provide a duration and 13 stated that they were in a relationship for less \nthan one month, with no specific duration obtained.  Of these participants, 6 (2 female, 4 male) were \nfrom the 18-19 age group, 9 (6 female, 3 male) were from the 20-29 age group, 7 (6 female, 1 male) \nwere from the 30-39 age group, 5 (3 female, 2 male) were from the 40-49 age group, and 3 (2 \nfemale, 1 male) were from the 50-59 age group.   \nTable 14 lists the minimum length of current relationship for 50% and 25% of the male and female \ngender identity groups according to age group.  For example, 50% of male participants aged 40-49 \nreported being in a current same-sex relationship for 8 years or more, and 25% for 13 years or more \nwith the longest for this male age group being 26 years.   \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     39 \n \nTable 14. \n \nMinimum number of years together in current relationship for 50% and 25% of male and female \ngender identity groups according to age \nAge group \nFemale \n50%=> \n Female \n25%=> \nFemale \nlongest \nMale \n50%=> \nMale \n25%=> \nMale \nlongest \n18-19 1.0      2.0   4.0 0.2 0.6  1.0 \n20-29 1.2 3.0  10.0 2.0 4.0 11.0 \n30-39 3.0 6.0  15.0 5.0 9.0  17.0 \n40-49  3.0 9.0  23.0 8.0 13.0  26.0 \n50-59 5.0 11.0  31.0 7.0 19.0 33.0 \n60 plus  1.0 6.0  28.0 7.0 18.0 41.0 \n \n5.1.3 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \nTable 15 below lists the numbers of transgender, transsexual and intersex participants who reported \nthat they had a current regular same-sex partner.  The current length of these relationships ranged \nfrom 1 month to 10 years with the longest on average being for transgender/transsexual male \nparticipants.  Transgender/transsexual male participants who reported currently having a regular \npartner were also younger relative to others listed in Table 15, with 80% being under the age of 35.  \nThe large majority of those partnered in the remaining three groups were over the age of 35. \nTable 15. \n \nTransgender/transsexual and intersex participants with regular same-sex partner \n  Yes (No)  \nTransgender/Transsexual - Female 4 (7)  \nTransgender/Transsexual - Male 5 (2)  \nIntersex - Female 3 (2)  \nIntersex - Male 0 (2)  \n \n5.1.4 Concluding Comment \nDiscussion of the findings in this chapter regarding the duration of same-sex relationships is not \nmeant to imply that longer relationships are necessarily better relationships.  Further, any \ninterpretation of the length of relationships of participants in this survey is difficult due to a host of \nfactors.  First, the data represent ongoing relationships, including those which were just recently \nformed.  Second, nonheterosexuals and their relationships continue to be perceived less favourably \nby certain sectors (e.g., Newspoll, 2006) and at this moment relationships are not affirmed by society \nthrough official registration or ceremonial process in Australian national law.  Additionally, at the \ntime the current survey was conducted, Australian national law recognising de facto status for same-\nsex couples had only just come into effect, and state and territory provisions for relationship \nregistration were relatively recent and available only in some jurisdictions.  This restricted access to \nany formal recognition of same-sex relationships in Australia may have some influence on the \nlongevity of these relationships.  For example, researchers have argued that socially sanctioned \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     40 \n \nrelationships, such as marriages (between different-sex couples), may provide for more enduring \nrelationships (albeit not necessarily positive) through perceptions of increased commitment and \nsocial support (e.g., Cherlin, 2004).  In keeping with this argument, an American study, involving 552 \nmarried same-sex couples living in Massachusetts, found that a substantial majority reported that \nmarriage had increased their commitment to their spouses, and that they felt more accepted by their \ncommunities and families as a result (Ramos, Goldberg, & Badgett, 2009).  Lastly, it is important to \nacknowledge the many factors which could have inhibited the same-sex relationships of participants \nin the current survey from forming in the first place.  For example, and as discussed earlier in this \nreport (see section 3.3), those in older age groups ‘came out’, on average, to someone for the very \nfirst time at significantly older ages.  Therefore, in the case of more senior participants, some would \nnot have been able to even start a relationship with someone of the same sex until later years in life.  \nThis would naturally have an impact on the length of the relationship relative to a person’s age.    \n5.2 Current Legal Status of Same-Sex Relationship \nNote:  Findings were initially released based on a larger sample of participants, including those \nwho did not complete the survey in full.  For comparative figures see Appendix-Auxiliary Report. \nParticipants who reported that they currently had a regular same-sex partner (whether living \ntogether or apart) were asked how they would describe their current same-sex relationship in legal \nterms.  To minimise confusion, participants were provided with examples for relationships formalised \nthrough a state or municipal registry in Australia.  These were ACT Civil Partnership, City of \nMelbourne Relationship Declaration, City of Sydney Relationship Declaration, Tasmania Significant \nRelationship, Victoria Domestic Partnership and Yarra City Council Relationship Declaration.  \nExamples of relationships recognised overseas were provided next to the relevant answer options \n(see Table 16 below).   \nTable 16. \n \nReported current legal status of same-sex relationship for participants with a regular same-sex \npartner, living together or apart \n N %  \nNo legal status  484 39.5  \nDe facto  660    53.8  \nRelationship formalised through a state or municipal registry (see \nexamples above) \n  46    3.8 \n \nOverseas recognised relationship other than marriage (e.g., UK Civil \nPartnership, NZ Civil Union) \n  39   3.2 \n \nOverseas marriage (e.g., Canada, Netherlands, South Africa, \nMassachusetts) \n  22   1.8  \nNote:  Respondents were able to select more than one option. \n \nParticipants were able to select more than one option regarding the legal status of their current \nrelationship with their regular partner, resulting in a total of over 100%.  The question asking \nparticipants how they would describe the legal status of their same-sex relationship also provided \nthe option of selecting ‘Other’.  Forty-six participants (3.8%) selected this ‘Other’ option.  However, \nthe majority of these participants (29 out of 46) had also selected one of the categories listed in \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     41 \n \nTable 16 and simply utilised the ‘Other’ text box to clarify their selection.  Three participants used the \n‘Other’ option to state that they were unsure about the legal status of their relationship and 13 did \nnot make the legal status of their relationship clear in their description.   \nResponses for this second report were very similar to those for the Auxiliary Report on relationship \nrecognition (see Appendix).  For example, 39.5% of this sample reported no legal status compared \nwith 40.5% in the first report and 53.8% reported being in a de facto relationship in this sample \ncompared with 53.1% in the first report.   \n5.2.1 Gender Identity and Current Legal Status \nTable 17 lists the numbers and percentages of participants according to the reported legal status of \ntheir relationships and their gender identity.  Larger percentages of gender different participants \nreported that their current relationship had no legal status when compared with those identifying as \nmale or female.  It is important to note, however, that gender different participants were younger on \naverage when compared with the rest of the sample, with 50% aged 26 years or under.  Legal status \nof relationships was markedly similar between male and female identifying participants.  However, \ngiven the number of male identifying participants in this particular sample relative to female, larger \npercentages of those who identified as male reported being in a formally registered relationship \nwhether in Australia or overseas.  Small numbers of participants also selected the ‘Other’ option.  For \nclarification of these ‘Other’ responses, refer to section 5.2. \nTable 17. \n \nReported current legal status of same-sex relationship for participants with a regular same-sex \npartner according to gender identity \n N - F % - F N - M % - M N- GD  % - GD \nNo legal status 286 38.5 185 39.7 13 72.2 \nDe facto 408 55.0 249 53.4 3 16.7 \nRelationship formalised \nthrough a state or municipal \nregistry  \n26 3.5 20 4.3 - - \nOverseas recognised \nrelationship other than \nmarriage (e.g., UK Civil \nPartnership, NZ Civil Union) \n20 2.7 19 4.1 - - \nOverseas marriage (e.g., \nCanada, Netherlands, South \nAfrica, Massachusetts) \n10 1.3 12 3.9 - - \nNote:  Respondents were able to select more than one option. \nF = Female, M = Male, GD = Gender Different \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     42 \n \n2.9% (54)\n14.8% (279)\n27.6% (519)\n54.7% (1028)\nNone\nDe facto\nFederally recognised registry - other than marriage\nMarriage\n5.2.2 Commitment Ceremonies \nOf the participants with a current regular same-sex partner, 10.4% reported that they had a \ncommitment ceremony unrelated to any official registration of a relationship.  Of these individuals, \n70% identified as female and 70% were from the older cohort of 35 years of age or over, when \nconsidering the three main cohorts in this survey (i.e., under 25 years, 25-34 years, 35+ years).  \n5.3 Personal Preference for Legal Recognition of Same-Sex Relationship  \nAll participants, regardless of whether or not they were currently in a same-sex relationship, were \nasked about their personal preference for legal relationship recognition in Australia.  Figure 14 below \nindicates the responses to the question “If you are or were to become involved in a long-term \ncommitted same-sex relationship, in what way would you prefer Australian law to recognise your \nrelationship?” \nFigure 14. \n \nPersonal preference for relationship recognition - general sample (including those not currently in \na same-sex relationship) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe percentages for personal preference for relationship recognition were consistent with those for \nthe earlier Auxiliary Report, which included the participants who did not complete the survey in full.  \nIn the earlier report, 54.2% reported a preference for marriage vs. 54.7% for the current sample, \n27.8% for a federally recognised relationship documented at a registry other than marriage vs. the \ncurrent 27.6%, 15.0% for de facto status vs. the current 14.8%, and 3.0% none vs. the current 2.9%.  \nFurther, a clear majority preference for marriage was found for all states and the Australian Capital \nTerritory.  The Northern Territory was the only area for which this was not the case with 23.5% \nindicating that they would prefer to marry and an even percentage of 35.3% for both de facto and a \nfederally recognised relationship documented at a registry other than marriage.  Although these \nfindings may reflect genuine differences in relationship preferences for this group compared with the \nrest of the sample, the small number of participants (N =18) from this area very much limits the \nextent to which these results can be interpreted as being representative.   \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     43 \n \n2.5 3.1\n7.9\n14.6 15.4\n10.5\n24.8\n30.8\n36.8\n58.1\n50.7\n44.7\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\nfemale                 \n(N=1043)\nmale                         \n(N=799)\ngender different          \n(N = 38)\nNone\nDe facto\nFederally recognised registry \n- other than marriage\nMarriage\nOf the total sample, six participants stated that they preferred a Civil Union and three stated that \nthey preferred a Civil Partnership, in the ‘Other’ text box provided.  As both types of relationships are \nforms of federally recognised relationships documented at a registry (other than marriage), these \nnine responses were included in the main category ‘Federally recognised registry- other than \nmarriage’.  Nineteen participants from this sample selected the ‘not applicable’ option (e.g., never \nwish to be in a long-term committed same-sex relationship) and were therefore excluded from the \nanalysis.  From the remaining sample of 2,013, 133 participants selected the ‘Other’ option with the \nmost common statement used to clarify this selection being that they simply wanted the same rights \nas heterosexuals (e.g., “identical to opposite-sex relationship recognition and rights”, “exactly the \nsame as heterosexual couples”).  These responses, although making an important statement, did not \nmake clear a single preference as instructed by the question.  Therefore, these responses, along with \nthose from others who did not indicate a specific preference, were not included in this analysis.  \nHowever, it is acknowledged that making a specific choice may have been difficult for some \nparticipants, particularly those who were not currently in a committed same-sex relationship.   \n5.3.1 Gender Identity and Relationship Recognition \nFigure 15 shows the percentages for personal preference for relationship recognition according to \ngender identity.  Although the majority of both male and female identifying participants selected \n‘marriage’ as their personal choice, the percentage was larger among those identifying as female \n(when considering younger-age participants, this difference between males and females was no \nlonger observed - see Figure 17).  Marriage was the most frequent option for gender different \nparticipants, however, unlike for male and female respondents, marriage was the preferred option of \nless than 50%.  In all cases, a federally recognised relationship documented at a registry (other than \nmarriage) was the second most frequent choice, followed by de facto.   \nFigure 15. \n \nPercentages of participants for personal preference for relationship recognition according to \ngender identity groups \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     44 \n \n0.9 1.0\n2.4 3.5\n7.3\n9.7\n7.7 8.8\n13.4\n22.0 23.3\n23.6\n24.8\n27.4 25.8\n29.4 29.0 33.3\n66.7\n62.8\n58.4\n45.1\n40.4\n33.3\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n18-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60 plus\nNone De facto Federally recognised registry - other than marriage Marriage\n5.3.2 Age and Relationship Recognition  \nFigure 16 below shows the percentages for participants’ personal preferences for relationship \nrecognition by age group.  As three people did not provide their age, the numbers are three fewer \nthan those included in Figure 15 (for information on invalid responses refer to section 5.3).  When \ntaking into account a person’s age, findings showed that the percentages of those who selected \nmarriage as their personal choice increased as the age of participants decreased.  For example, two-\nthirds of participants 18-19 selected marriage as their personal preference compared with one third \nof those 60 years of age or older.  Percentages for de facto and no legal recognition increased as age \nof participants increased.  Preferences for a federally recognised registry (other than marriage) \nvaried slightly between age groups, relative to the other three options.  The majority of both male \nand female participants in the three younger age groups (i.e., 18-19, 20-29, and 30-39) selected \nmarriage as their personal choice.  Although marriage remained the most frequent response for both \nmale and female participants for the older age groups (except the 60+ group), the numbers in these \ncases were less than 50%.  For gender different participants, results showing a majority for marriage \nwas found only for those aged 18-19, with percentages evenly split between marriage and a federally \nrecognised registry (other than marriage) for the remaining age groups.   \nFigure 16. \n \nPercentages of participants for personal preference for relationship recognition according to age \ngroup (N = 1877) \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     45 \n \n1.0 1.6\n9.8\n4.8\n26.3\n30.1\n52.9\n62.9 63.4\n47.1\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\nfemale                   \n(N=205)\nmale                  \n(N=186)\ngender different              \n(N=17)\nNone\nDe facto\nFederally recognised registry -\nother than marriage\nMarriage\n5.3.3 Relationship Recognition for Younger-Age Participants \nAs previously noted, although overall the majority of both male and female identifying participants \nselected marriage as their personal choice (see Figure 15), the percentage was larger among those \nidentifying as female (58.1%) when compared with male (50.7%).  When observing the findings for \npreferred relationship recognition for the three main age categories in this survey (i.e., under 25, 25-\n34, 35+), the greater preference for marriage among female participants, relative to male, was no \nlonger apparent for the youngest cohort.  Younger-age participants are more likely to have \nexperienced greater mainstream acceptance relative to their years (Savin-Williams, 2005).  Further, \nthe youngest of these have approached and/or entered into their adulthood during a time when the \ndefinition of marriage, in a growing number of countries, has been extended to include two \nconsenting adults.  It is possible then that this experience of greater social inclusion at least partially \nexplains the higher reported preference for marriage amongst these younger individuals (see Figure \n16) and what appears to be a greater similarity between genders (see Figure 17).   \nFigure 17. \n \nPercentages of participants for personal preference for relationship recognition according to \ngender identity for participants 18-24 yrs  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5.3.4 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \nTable 18 provides the numbers of transgender/transsexual and intersex participants according to \ntheir personal preferences for relationship recognition.  In the case of transgender/transsexual and \nintersex participants identifying as female, the majority selected marriage as their personal choice.  \nFor those identifying as male, the choice was more varied.  Of the three participants with responses \nmissing, two transgender/transsexual participants (1 female, 1 male) stated in the comment box that \nthey simply felt all types of relationships should be available and treated equally.  As this particular \nquestion requested a personal choice, these important statements were noted but not included with \nthe main data.

Figure 23 below shows participants’ responses to the question \n“Irrespective of your personal preference, which form(s) of relationship recognition would you like to \nsee remain and/or become available for same-sex couples in Australia?”  Note: Participants in this \ninstance were able to select multiple options.  \nFigure 23. \n \nPercentages of participants for preferred legal options for same-sex couples in Australia (N =2032) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOf the total sample, 78% of participants reported that they felt marriage should be made available \nfor same-sex couples in Australia, 59.7% were in favour of the availability of a federally recognised \nrelationship documented at a registry, and 48.4% were in favour of the option for de facto status.  As \nthis question allowed for multiple responses, these figures indicate that many felt that \nnonheterosexual couples should simply be given a choice.   \n5.6 Perceptions of the Public’s Attitude towards Same-Sex Relationships \nThe survey also asked participants how they felt the Australian public viewed legally recognised \nsame-sex relationships relative to legally recognised different-sex relationships.  Specifically, \nparticipants were asked how equivalent in value (i.e., worth) they felt the public viewed a) same-sex \nde facto relationships when compared with different-sex de facto relationships and b) current same-\nsex options for officially registered relationships (e.g., domestic and civil partnerships) compared \nwith different-sex marriages.  Figure 24 (A and B) provides the percentages of participants \nresponding to the scale 1 = not at all equivalent in value to 7 = absolutely equivalent in value.  These \nquestions also included a separate option for those who felt unable to make a judgement.  A total of \n1,938 participants responded to both, 92 selecting ‘unsure’ for at least one of the questions and two \nchose not to respond. \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     50 \n \n18.6\n24.8\n22.1\n14.8\n12.3\n5.5\n1.9\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n(A).

Given the long and \nongoing battle for relationship recognition for nonheterosexual couples, this is not surprising.  More \ninterestingly, and although the difference was not large, this discrepancy was significantly greater \nwhen it came to different-sex marriages vs. other forms of relationship registration available to \nsame-sex couples.  It is important to note, however, that de facto status for same-sex couples in \nAustralia came into effect only months before the commencement date of this survey.  Further, a \nrelatively small number of same-sex couples have documented their relationships through a state or \nmunicipal registry (TGLRG, 2010).  Given this, perceptions in most cases were not likely to have been \nbased on any personal experience.  Additionally, the responses to these questions do not necessarily \nreflect participants’ personal views on the value of these different types of relationships, rather \nsimply how they feel they are valued by others.    \n \n \n                                                          \n6\n Marriage is currently not available to same-sex couples in Australia, however, same-sex relationships can be formally \nrecognised through a state or municipal registry in some jurisdictions.  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     51 \n \n5.8 7.5\n14.7\n26.4\n45.6\n1.4 3.4\n7.2\n19.3\n68.7\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\na lot less in \nvalue\n2 3 4 at least as \nmuch value\nA.

Unlike the previous questions, that \nfocused on perceptions of the public’s attitude towards same-sex relationships, these questions \nallowed for a more personal assessment based on one’s own experiences.  Response options ranged \nfrom 1 = a lot less in value to 5 = at least as much value.  Numbers of participants represent those \nwho answered both questions, had a regular same-sex partner and reported others were aware of \ntheir relationships for each of the areas assessed.  Analyses revealed that, in all cases, a person’s own \nsame-sex relationship was perceived to be seen by others as being of lesser value to a significantly \ngreater extent when compared with different-sex marriages than when compared with different-sex \nde facto relationships.  When considering the views of heterosexual friends and contacts apart from \nfriends (e.g., neighbours, co-workers, employers, and teachers) these findings were even more \npronounced among participants who reported that they would prefer to marry.  Figure 25 provides \nthe percentages according to response options in relation to perceptions of heterosexual friends, \nheterosexual contacts (apart from friends), parents and siblings.  For example, 68.7% of participants \nwith a same-sex partner felt that their heterosexual friends, overall, considered their same-sex \nrelationships to have at least as much value as different-sex de facto relationships, however, only \n45.6% reported the same when it came to comparisons with different-sex marriages.  In the case of \nfamily, 51.2% of participants felt that their parent(s) considered their same-sex relationships to have \nat least as much value as different-sex de facto relationships, however, only a third (33.6%) reported \nthe same for the comparison with different-sex marriages.     \nFigure 25 (A, B, C and D). \n \nParticipants’ perceptions of how heterosexual friends, contacts and family members valued their \nsame-sex relationships relative to different-sex relationships \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     52 \n \n9.5\n16.4\n29.6 28.0\n16.6\n2.8\n7.7\n24.4\n35.5\n29.6\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\na lot less in \nvalue\n2 3 4 at least as \nmuch value\nB.

This was found to be \nthe case when considering the extent to which participants felt that their heterosexual friends, \nheterosexual contacts (such as neighbours, employers, teachers or co-workers), parents and siblings \nvalued their same-sex relationships relative to different-sex de facto relationships and marriages.  As \nan example, Figure 26 below shows the relationship between well-being and perceptions of how \nheterosexual friends value one’s same-sex relationship relative to different-sex marriages. \nFigure 26. \n \nThe relationship between overall psychological well-being (PWB) and perceptions of how \nheterosexual friends value one’s same-sex relationship compared with different-sex marriages \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5.9 Summary  \nDespite the reference to percentages regarding the relationship recognition measures presented in \nthis survey, it is acknowledge that numbers are not necessarily relevant when it comes to the \nargument for relationship equality.  As is often stated, it is about the right to choose.  The rationale \nfor obtaining figures for preferred relationship recognition in this survey was to be able to add to the \ncurrent literature on nonheterosexual relationships and provide information to help address the \nmany myths that propagate due to the limited information available.  \nThis national survey was the first to examine same-sex attracted Australians’ preferences for various \nforms of relationship recognition since the introduction of de facto status for same-sex couples at a \nfederal level.  It is also the first major study to investigate preferences for relationship recognition, \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     54 \n \nwhile taking into account the current legal status (in Australia or overseas) of an individual’s       \nsame-sex relationship. \nFindings from the relationship recognition measures of this survey demonstrate that same-sex \nattracted individuals, like other Australians, differ in the way they prefer their relationships to be \nformally recognised.  However, the results showed that the majority of same-sex attracted \nparticipants selected marriage as their personal choice.  A federally recognised relationship \ndocumented at a registry other than marriage was the second most popular option, and de facto \nstatus was the third.  The preference for a relationship without any legal status was selected by only \n2.9% of the overall sample.   \nMarriage was found to be the choice of the majority irrespective of the current legal status of \nparticipants’ same-sex relationships (including no legal status).  For example, of those currently in a \nde facto relationship, 55.6% stated they preferred marriage for themselves, 26% stated that they \npreferred a federally recognised relationship other than marriage, 16.9% selected de facto and 1.5% \nchose no legal status (Note: for similar figures, including participants who did not complete the \nsurvey in full, please refer to the Auxiliary Report).  \nInterestingly, the younger the age of the participant the more likely they were to have selected \nmarriage as their personal choice.  For example, 66.7% of those 18-19 and 62.8% of those 20-29 \nselected marriage as their personal preference.  Although the majority of both male and female \nidentifying participants reported that they preferred to marry, the percentage was significantly \nhigher for females.  For younger-age participants (under 25 years) differences between males and \nfemales were no longer observed with 63% from both groups selecting the option to marry. \nParticipants were also given the opportunity to select which forms of legal relationship recognition \nthey would like to see remain and/or become available in this country for same-sex couples in \ngeneral.  Responses to this measure (which allowed for multiple selections) showed that 78% would \nlike to see marriage become available as an option, 59.7% would like to see a federally recognised \nrelationship other than marriage be made available and 48.4% would like to see de facto recognition \nremain.  These percentages indicate that many participants selected multiple options, suggesting \nthat simply having a choice was an important factor.     \nParticipants with a regular same-sex partner reported that they felt their own same-sex relationship \nwas seen by others (heterosexual friends, contacts other than friends, and family) as being of lesser \nvalue to a significantly greater extent when compared with different-sex marriages than when \ncompared with different-sex de facto relationships.  Further, these findings were even more \npronounced among those who reported that they would like to be able to marry, supporting the \nargument that a desire to marry, among other factors, is likely to be influenced by one’s perception \nof the value society places on such unions.  Importantly, the more participants felt others valued \ntheir relationships, relative to different-sex relationships, the greater their reported psychological \nwell-being. \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     55 \n \n6. Children  \n6.1 Children in a Person’s Life \nParticipants were asked if there were any children (young or adult) in their lives, whether their own \nor the result of a current or previous relationship.  The response options were ‘No’, ‘Yes’ ‘Expecting a \nchild’ and ‘Planning on having children’.  As a person could have children but also plan on or be \nexpecting another, participants could select more than one option.  Those who responded with ‘yes’ \nwere then asked about the extent to which they lived or spent time with the child/children and each \nchild’s age. \nWhen looking at the total sample, 29.2% of females, 10.0% of males and 25.5% of gender different \nparticipants reported having children in their lives, whether their own or the result of a current or \nprevious relationship (see Figure 19).  For those with a current same-sex partner, a third of both \ngender different and female participants reported having children in their lives compared with 13.9% \nof partnered males.  The similar percentages for female and gender different participants may be \nlargely attributed to the fact that 83% of gender different participants reported that they were \ndefined as biologically female at birth.  Although not included in the figures below, some participants \nmentioned in the comment box provided that although they did not have their own children, or \nthose from a current or previous relationship, they were nonetheless a substantial part of their \nnieces and/or nephews lives.  A more meaningful interpretation of these findings (i.e., percentages \nfor those at ages most likely to have children) is provided on the following page. \nTable 19. \n \nPercentages of participants with children currently in their lives (one’s own or from a current or \nprevious relationship), expecting a child or who plan on having children, for the total sample and \nthose with a same-sex partner \nChildren  \nFemale \nTotal  \n Female \nPartnered \n Male \nTotal \nMale \nPartnered \nGender \nDifferent \nTotal \nGender \nDifferent \nPartnered \n (1125)  (742)     (860) (466) (47)  (18) \nPlan on having 19.4% 20.9%  13.1% 11.4% 23.4% 22.2% \nExpecting 1.0% 1.1%  0.1% 0.0% 0.0%  0.0% \nHave 29.2% 33.4%  10.0% 13.9% 25.5% 33.3% \nNumbers of participants are provided in brackets ( ).

Fifteen participants did not provide a specific \nnumber.  Of the remaining sample of 411, 41.1% reported one child, 35.8% two children and 23.1% \nthree children or more.  For participants in the youngest cohort in this survey (< 25 years) 50% \nreported the eldest child to be 3 years of age or younger, for those aged 25-34 years, 50% reported \nthe eldest to be 7 or younger and for those aged 35 years or over, 50% reported the eldest to be 18 \nor younger.  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     56 \n \n6.1.2 Percentages with Children According to Gender Identity and Age of Cohort \nFigures 27 through to 29 provide the percentages of participants who reported that they had \nchildren in their lives, whether their own or as a result of a current or previous relationship, \naccording to gender identity and age of cohort.  Also included are the figures for those who reported \nthat they were expecting a child and those who reported that they planned on having children.  More \nthan one selection was made possible.  Overall 29.2 % of participants who identified as female \nreporting having children in their lives, whether their own or as a result of a current or previous \nrelationship (see Table 19), however, when considering those in the age group most likely to have \nchildren7 (i.e., those 35 years of age or over) the figure was 47.1% (see Figure 27).  Although a high \npercentage (69.2%) of gender different participants 35 years of age and over reported that they had \nchildren in their lives, the interpretation of this finding is severely limited due to the small number in \nthis age group (see Figure 29).  For participants identifying as male, the overall percentage of those \nwith children in their lives was 10%, however, for males 35 years of age or over it was 17.6% (see \nFigure 28). \nFigure 27. \n \nPercentages of female participants with children currently in their lives (one’s own or from a \ncurrent or previous relationship), expecting a child or who plan on having children   \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n7\n According to data from the 2006 Census, the percentages of women from the general population who had \nnot had children were 85.5% of those 20-24 years of age, 36.6% of those 30-34 years of age and 15.9% of those \n40-44 years of age (ABS, 2008).  \n5.1\n17.0\n47.1\n0.5 1.6 0.7\n32.7 31.5\n5.8\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n18-24                       \n(N=214)\n25-34                      \n(N=371)\n35+                      \n(N=539)\nAxis female\nHave\nExpecting\nPlan on having \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     57 \n \n11.1\n6.3\n69.2\n27.8\n31.3\n7.7\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n18-24                          \n(N=18)\n25-34                         \n(N=16)\n35+                           \n(N=13)\ngender different (83% defined biologically female at birth)\nHave\nExpecting\nPlan on having\n4.1\n17.6\n.02\n29.5\n19.0\n2.7\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n18-24                             \n(N=200)\n25-34                    \n(N=221)\n35+                            \n(N=437)\nmale\nHave\nExpecting\nPlan on having\nFigure 28. \n \nPercentages of male participants with children currently in their lives (one’s own or from a current \nor previous relationship), expecting a child or who plan on having children \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 29. \n \nPercentages of gender different participants with children currently in their lives (one’s own or \nfrom a current or previous relationship), expecting a child or who plan on having children   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     58 \n \n6.2 Time Spent Sharing or Living with Children  \nParticipants who reported having children as part of their lives (whether their own or from a current \nor previous relationship) were asked about the extent to which they lived or spent time with the \nchild or children.  As adult children are more likely to be living independently, analyses were first \nconducted for those who reported at least one child still under the age of 208.  As shown in Table 20 \nbelow, for those identifying as female, 95.3% spent time with these children, 89.7% spent time on a \nregular basis (ranging from sometime to full-time) and 64.7% were with these children full-time.  For \nthose identifying as male, 87% spent time with these children, 64.8% spent time on a regular basis \n(ranging from sometime to full-time) and 24.1% were with these children full-time.

For this group, 61.3% spent time with these adult children and 25.3% spent time on a \nregular basis (ranging from sometime to full-time).  In the case of participants identifying as female, \nwith all children at least 20 years of age or older, 7.3% lived full-time with the adult child/children \nand a further 6.1% spent most of the time with them.  \n6.2.2 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \n Of those who identified as transgender/transsexual female (N = 11), intersex female (N = 5) and \nintersex male (N = 2), 40-50% reported having children in their lives, either their own or from a \ncurrent or previous relationship.  Further, two of the participants who identified as \ntransgender/transsexual male (N = 7) and one who identified as transgender/transsexual female \nreported that they planned on having children.  Of those with children in their lives, at least 40% \nspent time with these children on a regular basis and three of these participants lived with the \nchild/children full-time.  \n                                                          \n8\n Based on data from the 2006-07 Family Characteristics and Transitions Survey, a 2009 report from the Australian Bureau \nof Statistics revealed that women tend to first leave home at 19.8 years of age and men at 20.9 years of age (ABS, 2009a).  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     59 \n \n6.3 Marriage Preferences among those Partnered and Living with Children \nA majority of participants (54.2%) who reported that children were not currently a part of their lives \nstill selected marriage as their personal choice for relationship recognition.  The percentages \nreporting a preference for marriage, however, were higher among participants with a same-sex \npartner and living full-time with children, particularly young children.  For these participants, and \nwhere the eldest was reported to be under 13 years of age (generally primary school age or under), \n74.7% reported they personally preferred marriage.  In cases where the eldest was under 5 (generally \nnon-school age) the figure for marriage was 80.8%.  Perhaps for these couples, the need to have \ntheir relationships legitimised is of even greater concern, given the strong opposition to same-sex \nparenting from certain sectors (e.g., ACL, 2008).  It is important to note, however, that 95% of \nparticipants partnered and living full-time with children, all under the age of 13, identified as female.    \n \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     60 \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\nPartner Support\nFemale (N=742) Male (N=466) Gender different (N=18)\n7.

Figure 30 shows the percentages for each response option for those who reported \nhaving a regular same-sex partner.  Of this sample, 59.3% of female, 46.6% of male and 50% of \ngender different participants reported that they felt their partners were extremely supportive.  \nOverall, over 80% of participants reported that their partner was at least very supportive.  When \nlooking at the averages of support scores (1-9), those identifying as female reported significantly \nhigher levels of partner support (M = 8.06) compared with those identifying as male (M = 7.61).  This \nis in keeping with findings for females in general, in that females tend to score higher than males for \nmeasures of positive relationships with others (e.g., Ryff & Keyes, 1995).  The average score for \ngender different participants was the same as for males (M = 7.61), however, the number of \nparticipants in this case was small and no statistically significant differences were found between this \ngroup and those identifying as female. \n  \nFigure 30. \n \nPercentages of participants for perceived partner support scores by gender identity \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     61 \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nStrongly \ndisagree\n2 3 4 5 Strongly \nagree\nB.

Response options \nwere 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Moderately Disagree, 3 = Slightly Disagree, 4 = Slightly Agree, 5 = \nModerately Agree and 6 = Strongly Agree.

Irrespective of gender, over 80% of participants indicated that they \nmoderately to strongly agreed that they were satisfied with their current same-sex relationship.  \nWhen looking at the averages for relationship satisfaction scores, the difference between females \nand males was statistically significant, although the difference was not large.  The average score for \nthose identifying as female was 5.48 and for those identifying as male it was 5.31.  The average score \nfor gender different participants was 5.22.  Once again the numbers for this latter group were small, \nlimiting the interpretation of these findings.   \n7.3 Partner ‘Disclosure Comfort’ Similarity  \nAs discussed earlier in Charter 4, on issues relating to ‘coming out’, the survey included a 5-item \npartner similarity measure devised by Mohr and Fassinger (2006) which was found to predict \nrelationship quality.  Participants were asked to what extent they agreed or disagreed with five \nstatements relating to the perceived similarity between oneself and one’s partner over the disclosure \nof, and comfort with, one’s sexuality.  The items were “My partner and I are equally comfortable \nbeing ‘out’ in public”, “My partner and I are equally comfortable being ‘out’ to family”, “My partner \nand I are equally comfortable being ‘out’ to heterosexual friends”, “My partner and I are equally \ncomfortable being a same-sex couple” and “My partner and I are equally comfortable about being \nsame-sex attracted”.  Response options were 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Moderately Disagree, 3 = \nSlightly Disagree, 4 = Slightly Agree, 5 = Moderately Agree and 6 = Strongly Agree.  Consistent with \nprevious research (Mohr & Fassinger, 2006), the scores for each of these items were combined and \naveraged to provide an overall score for partner ’disclosure comfort’ similarity.  Figure 32 provides \nthe average score for participants with a regular same-sex partner for each of the three age cohorts.  \nThe youngest cohort (<25) reported significantly less partner ‘disclosure comfort’ similarity when \ncompared with the two older-age cohorts.   \nFigure 32. \n \nAverage scores for partner ‘disclosure comfort’ similarity by age cohort \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     63 \n \n5.12\n5.70\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nLOW HIGH\nM\nea\nn\n s\nco\nre\n f\no\nr \nre\nla\nti\no\nn\nsh\nip\n \nsa\nti\nsf\nac\nti\no\nn\n \nPartner 'Disclosure Comfort' Similarity\n7.3.1 Partner ‘Disclosure Comfort’ Similarity and Relationship Satisfaction  \nThe greater the extent to which participants felt that they were similar to their partners in being ‘out’ \nand comfortable with their sexuality, the significantly greater their reported level of relationship \nsatisfaction9.  Figure 33 shows the average scores for those who reported low levels vs. high levels of \npartner ‘disclosure comfort’ similarity.  The low vs. high categories were based on participants’ \nresponses that were below the median score and those that were above the median score.  \nResponse options were 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Moderately Disagree, 3 = Slightly Disagree,              \n4 = Slightly Agree, 5 = Moderately Agree and 6 = Strongly Agree to being generally satisfied with \none’s current same-sex relationship.  As a whole, participants reported that they were relatively \nsatisfied with their relationships.  Those who scored low on partner ‘disclosure comfort’ similarity \nreported on average that they ‘moderately agreed’ that they were satisfied with their relationship (M \n= 5.12) whereas for those who scored high on partner ‘disclosure comfort’ similarity, the average was \napproaching ‘strongly agreed’ (M = 5.70).  For findings on partner ‘disclosure comfort’ similarity and \nits relationship to likelihood of ‘coming out’ during the social encounters described in the three \nscenarios presented in this survey, refer to section 4.4. \nFigure 33. \n \nAverage scores for relationship satisfaction for low vs. high levels of perceived partner ‘disclosure \ncomfort’ similarity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n7.4 Well-Being and Relationship Measures \nPerceived partner support, relationship satisfaction and partner ‘disclosure comfort’ similarity were \nall significantly associated with participants reported level of well-being.  Specifically, those who \nreported greater levels of perceived support, satisfaction, and similarity were more likely to report \nhigher levels of psychological well-being.  For findings on the role of partner support, alongside the \nrole of heterosexual acceptance, in predicting well-being, refer to section 9.4.  \n  \n                                                          \n9\n Analyses were also conducted with ‘Disclosure Comfort’ Similarity as a continuous variable.   \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     64 \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\nGLBTI friends support\nFemale (N=1102) Male (N=834) Gender different (N=44)\n8. GLBTI Friends and Community  \n8.1 Support from GLBTI friends \nOf the total sample, 51 (2.5%) participants reported that they did not have any GLBTI friends (22 \nfemales, 26 males, and 3 gender different).  Close to 70% of these participants lived in capital cities.  \nThose who reported having these friends were presented with the question “Overall, how supportive \n(helpful, caring or encouraging) do you find your GLBTI friends, NOT including a partner?” The \nresponse options ranged from 1 = not at all supportive to 9 = extremely supportive.  One person did \nnot respond to this question leaving a total of 1,980 participants.  Of this sample, 41.1% of female, \n35.3% of male and 38.6% of gender different participants reported that they felt their GLBTI friends \nwere extremely supportive (see Figure 34).  Among females, 85% reported that their GLBTI friends \nwere very to extremely supportive.  Among males the figure was 78% and for gender different \nparticipants it was 79.5%.  When looking at the averages of support scores (1-9), those identifying as \nfemale reported significantly higher levels of GLBTI friendship support (M = 7.60) compared with \nthose identifying as male (M = 7.32).  Once again, this is consistent with findings for females in \ngeneral, in that females tend to score higher than males for measures on positive relationships with \nothers (e.g., Ryff & Keyes, 1995) and is in keeping with an earlier study involving same-sex attracted \nyoung adults in Australia (Dane & MacDonald, 2009).  The average score for gender different \nparticipants were similar to those for males (M = 7.34), however, numbers were small and no \nstatistically significant differences were found between this group and those identifying as female.   \nFigure 34. \n \nPercentages for participants perceived support from GLBTI friends by gender identity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     65 \n \n37.4\n62.6\n30.2\n69.8\n36.2\n63.8\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nno yes\nContact with GLBTI community (apart from friends)\nfemale (N=1122)\nmale (N=858)\ngender different (N=47)\n8.2 Contact with the GLBTI Community \n8.2.1 Gender Differences \nFollowing the question on support from GLBTI friends, participants were presented with the question \n“Do you have any contact with individuals (apart from friends) from the GLBTI community (e.g., a \nGLBTI employer, teacher, business or volunteer work associate, health professional)?”  Response \noptions were “Yes” or “No”.  Overall, just over a third (34.3%) of participants reported that they did \nnot have any contact with individuals from the GLBTI community when not including their GLBTI \nfriends.  As shown in Figure 35, a higher percentage of those identifying as male (69.8%) reported \ncontact relative to female (62.6%), and gender different participants (63.8%).  Five participants did \nnot respond to the question. \nFigure 35. \n \nPercentages of participants who reported contact vs. no contact with the GLBTI community (apart \nfrom friends) by gender identity \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n8.2.2 Age and Area of Residence \nTable 21 shows the percentages for those who reported contact with the GLBTI community based on \narea of residence and age cohort.  Numbers in brackets represent the total number of participants in \na particular category with figures representing the percentage of the total number who reported \nhaving GLBTI community contact, aside from GLBTI friends.  Not surprisingly, people living in capital \ncities were more likely to have reported contact with the community relative to those living in other \nareas (for a description of population sizes for area of residence, refer to Table 1, section 1.1).  \nFurther, there was a significant relationship between age of participants and contact with the GLBTI \ncommunity.

Refer to \nTable 1, section 1.1, for population sizes.  Numbers in brackets represent total number living in area. \n8.3 Feeling Connected to the GLBTI Community \nTo examine how connected people felt to the GLBTI community in general, all participants were \nasked “How connected to the GLBTI community do you feel in your everyday life?” with response \noptions ranging from 1 = not at all to 5 = very.  Although not all participants reported having contact \nwith the GLBTI community, some may nonetheless have felt a connection in some way, with results \nindicating that this was in fact the case.  For example, although 34.3% of the total sample reported \nhaving no contact, only 12.8% overall indicated that they did not feel at all connected (see Figure 36).  \nWhen considering the age of participants, those of a younger age reported significantly less \nconnection to the community than those of an older age, which is consistent with the findings \ndiscussed earlier, that younger participants reported significantly less contact with the community \nthan older participants (see summary in section 8.7 for findings in relation to proportion of \nheterosexual friends).  Further, living in more populated areas was significantly related to feeling \nmore connected to the GLBTI community.   \nFigure 36. \n \nPercentages of participants for reported connection to the GLBTI community by age cohort \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     67 \n \n8.4 Perceived Support from the GLBTI Community \nParticipants who reported having contact with individuals from the GLBTI community (apart from \nfriends) were then asked “Overall, how supportive (helpful, caring, or encouraging) do you feel people \nfrom the wider GLBTI community (e.g., a GLBTI employer, teacher, business or volunteer work \nassociate, health professional) are for you”?  Response options ranged from 1 = not at all supportive \nto 9 = extremely supportive.  Two people did not respond resulting in a sample of 1, 329 participants.  \nAs shown in Figure 37, 27% of male, 24% of female and 20% of gender different participants reported \nthat they considered the GLBTI community to be extremely supportive.  The percentages for those \nwho reported that they felt this community was at least very supportive (i.e., very to extremely) were \n66.3% for female, 68.7% for male and 60% for gender different participants.  The average scores for \ncommunity support were not found to be significantly different between males (M = 6.92), females \n(M = 6.83), and gender different (M = 6.53) participants.  Interestingly, no significant differences \nwere found for perceptions of community support based on age or area of residence.  It is important \nto keep in mind, however, that the scores represent only people who already had some form of \ncontact with the GLBTI community (i.e., those who reported no contact were not included in this \nparticular analysis).  Further, the number of participants were small for those living in remote areas \n(see Table 21), with nine having reported contact with the GLBTI community.  For differences found \nbased on area of residence, refer to the findings on contact with and connection to the GLBTI \ncommunity (see section 8.2.2).  \n \nFigure 37. \n \nPercentages of participants according to responses for perceived support from GLBTI community \n(apart from friends) by gender identity \n \n \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\nSupport GLBTI Community (apart from friends)\nfemale (N=700) male (N=599) gender different (N=30)\nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     68 \n \n8.5 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \nPerceived support from GLBTI friends was relatively high among transgender/transsexual and \nintersex participants, with 80 -100% in these groups having reported that these friends were very to \nextremely supportive.  Consistent with findings for the general sample, perceptions of support from \nthe wider GLBTI community were lower than for friends.  Table 22 provides average scores for this \ncommunity support, the percentages of those who scores ranged from very to extremely supportive \nand the numbers in each group that reported having contact with the wider GLBTI community.  For \nexample, of the eight female transgender/transsexual participants with contact with the community, \n75% reported that they perceived this community to be very to extremely supportive.  Although the \nsmall number of participants limits the interpretation of these findings, the lower levels of perceived \nsupport, particularly for female intersex participants, should also be noted (for figures for the general \nsample, refer to figure 37).  Although perceived support in some instances was lower among these \ngroups, the extent to which these participants felt a connection with the community was in most \ncases higher10, when compared with the general sample.  Once again, it needs to be kept in mind \nthat all participants in this survey reported having same-sex attractions.  An affiliation with the GLBTI \ncommunity may not be as high for transgender, transsexual or intersex individuals who identify as \nheterosexual.   \nTable 22. \n \nAverage scores for and percentages of transgender/transsexual and intersex participants who \nreported finding the GLBTI community (apart from friends) very to extremely supportive \n Average score % high support  Contact Yes (No)   \n \n     contact  \n \nTrans - Female 7.13 75.0% 8 (3)  \nTrans -  Male 7.20 80.0% 5 (2)  \nIntersex - Female 5.25 25.0% 4 (1)  \nIntersex - Male  6.00 a 2 (0)  \nNote: Percentages for those who perceived high support (very to extremely) are based on the \nnumbers of participants who reported having contact with the GLBTI community.  Mean scores are \nbased on a 1-9 scale.  a = Figures are not provided as doing so would identify participants’ scores due \nto the small number of cases. \n8.6 Well-being and Perceived Support from GLBTI Friends and Community  \nOn average, participants who reported having contact with the wider GLBTI community scored \nhigher on psychological well-being than those who reported having no contact.  The extent to which \nparticipants felt supported by their GLBTI friends and the community was also related to their \npsychological well-being, with those who reported higher levels of these types of support being more \nlikely to have reported higher levels of well-being.  Support from GLBTI friends and the community \nare discussed further in the next chapter (Chapter 9) in which their roles in predicting well-being are \nconsidered alongside the roles of acceptance from heterosexual friends, family and the heterosexual \ncommunity. \n                                                          \n10\n Differences between groups are in these cases based on observed differences not statistical differences. \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     69 \n \n8.7 Summary \nAlthough differences were not large when it came to the level of support participants felt that they \nreceived from their GBLTI friends, those who identified as female reported statistically significantly \nhigher levels of support compared with those who identified as male.  This is consistent with an \nearlier study involving same-sex attracted young adults in Queensland, Australia (Dane & \nMacDonald, 2009) and research showing that females in general tend to score higher for measures \nevaluating positive relationships with others (Ryff & Keyes, 1995).  For findings from the current \nsurvey revealing higher scores for females on positive relationships with others, refer to Chapter 10.  \nWhen it came to contact with the wider GLBTI community (e.g., a GLBTI employer, teacher, business \nor volunteer work associate, health professional), higher percentages of those identifying as male \nreported contact relative to female and gender different participants.  As expected, those living in \ncapital cities were more likely to report having contact with this community, relative to those living in \nless populated areas.  Further, people living in more populated areas were more likely to report \nfeeling a greater connection to the GLBTI community than those living in less populated areas.  More \ninterestingly, younger participants were more likely to report less contact with the community and \nlower levels of connectedness with the community than older age participants, even when taking \ninto account the population size of the areas in which participants lived.  This is consistent with \nfindings discussed in the following chapter showing younger participants were more likely to report \nhaving a greater proportion of heterosexual friends than participants of an older age, and that \npeople with a greater proportion of heterosexual friends were less likely to have contact with the \nGLBTI community or feel connected with this community.  Importantly, for those with contact, higher \nlevels of support from GLBTI friends and the wider GLBTI community were both related to higher \nlevels of overall well-being.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     70 \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\nnone very few few more \nthan few < \nhalf\nhalf slightly \nmore than \nhalf \nmost (2/3) nearly all all\nProportion of heterosexual friends\n<25 yrs (N=432) 25-34 yrs (N=608) 35+ yrs (N=988)\n9. Family and Heterosexual Friends and Community \n9.1 ‘Out’ to Others \n9.1.1 Proportion of Heterosexual Friends \nParticipants were first presented with the question “When you consider the number of friends you \nhave in general, how many do you estimate to be heterosexual?” with response options ranging from \n1 = none to 9 = all.  One participant did not respond and three did not provide their age leaving a \ntotal of 2,028 represented in Figure 38 below.  A majority (52.3%) of those under the age of 25 \nreported that ‘most’ to ‘all’ of their friends were heterosexual.  For those 25-34 years of age this \nfigure was 43.3% and for those 35 years and over it was less than a third (31.7%).  The average scores \n(ranging from 1-9) were 6.13 for the youngest cohort, 5.73 for the middle cohort and 5.34 for the \noldest cohort.  Results showed that younger participants were significantly more likely to report \nhaving a greater proportion of heterosexual friends than older age participants.   \nFigure 38. \n \nPercentages of participants according to responses for proportion of heterosexual friends \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9.1.2  ‘Out’ to Heterosexual Friends, Contacts and Family \nParticipants were then asked if they currently had any heterosexual friends to whom they had \ndisclosed their same-sex attractions or who they were confident were aware of their same-sex \nattractions.  The same question was presented in relation to heterosexual contacts other than friends \n(e.g., neighbours, co-workers, employers or teachers).  They were then advised that if they \nconsidered any of these individuals to be more of a friend, then they were to include them only in \nthe question about friends.  Participants were also asked if they had disclosed their same-sex \nattractions to their mother, father or siblings, or felt confident these individuals were aware of their \nsame-sex attractions.  Table 23 presents the percentages of participants who reported that they had \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     71 \n \ndisclosed their same-sex attractions’, or felt confident others were aware of their same-sex \nattractions, for the five areas discussed above.   \nTable 23. \n \nPercentages of participants ‘out’ to heterosexual friends, contacts, and family \n (N) Yes (N) No  (N) Missing   \n \n     contact  \n \nHeterosexual Friends (1965) 96.8% (66)   3.2% (1)  \nHeterosexual Contacts (1724) 84.9% (307) 15.1% (1)  \nMother (1720) 84.8% (308) 15.2% (4)  \nFather  (1418) 70.0% (609) 30.0% (5)  \nSiblings (1722) 88.8% (217) 11.2%            92 no siblings,  (1)  \n \n \n \n \n \n)missing) (93)  \n \nNote: Percentages are based on totals for each sector minus missing or not applicable data.  \nConsistent with research in this area (e.g., Hillier, Turner, & Mitchell, 2005) a higher proportion of \nparticipants reported their mother’s knowledge of their same-sex attractions (84.8%) than their \nfather’s (70.0%), with friends being the most likely to be aware (96.8%).  However, the extent to \nwhich individuals’ interpersonal networks as a whole knew of their sexual orientation, varied \nbetween individuals.  For example, of the total sample, only 60.5% indicated that others were aware \nof their same-sex attractions in all areas (note: as not all individuals have siblings, this sector was not \nincluded in the sum).  This finding is consistent with an earlier study involving same-sex attracted \nyoung adults in Australia (Dane & MacDonald, 2009) which found 59% reported being ‘out’ in all of \nthese four areas.  This suggests that, although large percentages of sexual minority individuals report \nbeing ‘out of the closet’, many appear to still have reservations about revealing their same-sex \nattractions in certain sectors or at least feel less need to do so.   \n9.1.3 Proportion of Heterosexual Friends and Contacts Aware of Sexual Orientation  \nParticipants who answered “Yes” to having heterosexual friends or contacts aware of their same-sex \nattractions were then asked about the proportion of these friends or contacts they felt confident \nwere aware.  Response options ranged from 1 = very few (e.g., one) to 7 = all.  Findings revealed that \na majority (57%) reported that all of their heterosexual friends were aware of their same-sex \nattractions and 87% reported that ‘most’ to ‘all’ were aware.  In the case of heterosexual contacts \n(apart from friends), 11.9% felt all their contacts were aware and 60.9% reported that ‘most’ to ‘all’ \nwere aware.  When considering the three main age cohorts of this survey (< 25 yrs, 25-34 yrs, 35+ \nyears) results showed that those in the two older cohorts reported having a significantly greater \nproportion of heterosexual friends and contacts aware of their same-sex attractions when compared \nwith the youngest cohort.  When taking a closer look at this data, however, it became apparent that \nthere was a clear exception when it came to those 60 years of age or older, with this finding \ndiscussed further on.  Figure 39 shows the average scores for the proportion of heterosexual friends \nand contacts aware for the six different age groups in this survey.  The numbers represented in each \nage group vary depending on the number ‘out’ to heterosexual friends vs. heterosexual contacts.  \nThe numbers of participants were as follows: 18-19 (friends 114, contacts 83), 20-29 (friends 617, \ncontacts 501), 30-39 (friends 525, contacts 475), 40-49 (friends 425, contacts 408), 50-59 (friends \n205, contacts 195), and 60+ (friends 76, contacts 60).  Three people did not provide an age, three of \nwhich were ‘out’ to friends and two of which were ‘out’ to contacts. \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     72 \n \n5.61\n5.86\n6.24\n6.33\n6.07\n5.07\n3.64\n4.42\n4.78 4.93 4.71\n4.07\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n18-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60+\nM\nea\nn\n s\nco\nre\ns \nfo\nr \np\nro\np\no\nrt\nio\nn\n o\nf \nh\net\ner\no\nse\nxu\nal\n \nfr\nie\nn\nd\ns \nan\nd\n c\no\nn\nta\nct\ns \naw\nar\ne \no\nf \nse\nxu\nal\nit\ny \nAge group\nProportion heterosexual \nfriends aware\nProportion heterosexual \ncontacts aware\nFigure 39. \n \nAverage scores (1 = very few to 7 = all) for proportion of heterosexual friends and contacts (apart \nfrom friends) aware of same-sex attractions \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen comparing all six age groups, analyses revealed that generally those in older age groups \nreported having a greater proportion of heterosexual friends and contacts aware of their same-sex \nattractions relative to those in younger age groups.  Although the data are cross-sectional,  these \nfindings overall suggest that perhaps over time individuals are likely to gradually increase the \nproportion of their friends and contacts to whom they have disclosed their same-sex attractions.  \nParticipants 60 years of age or over, however, reported a significantly smaller proportion of \nheterosexual friends aware of their same-sex attractions than all other age groups except those 18-\n19 years of age (although the mean score was also lower than for those 18-19 years of age, the \ndifference in this case was not statistically significant).  In the case of the proportion of heterosexual \ncontacts aware, those 60 years of age or over reported a significantly smaller proportion of these \ncontacts aware, compared with the younger age groups consisting of those 30 to <50 years of age.  \nRecent public polls show that those in senior age groups are far more likely, on average, to have \nexperienced higher levels of prejudice and discrimination relative to younger sexual minority \nindividuals (e.g., Schafer & Shaw, 2009).  These early negative experiences may have an ongoing \nimpact on more senior individuals’ decisions to be open about their sexuality.  Additionally, senior \nsexual minority individuals are more likely to be surrounded by older-age heterosexual individuals \nfrom a less accepting era.  Both these factors are likely to play a role in contributing to the lower \nproportion of their heterosexual friends and contacts aware of their sexuality when compared with \nyounger generations.  It is also important to keep in mind, when interpreting these findings, that the \nolder the participant, on average, the smaller the proportion of friends they reported to be \nheterosexual (see Figure 38).  Therefore, for younger people to increase the proportion of friends \naware of their same-sex attractions, they would in effect have to tell more friends relative to those in \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     73 \n \nolder age groups.  The same logic obviously does not apply when it comes to disclosing to the wider \ncommunity (i.e., heterosexual contacts).  \n9.2 Perceived Acceptance of Others \n9.2.1 Age Differences for Perceptions of Acceptance \nParticipants who reported that at least some of their heterosexual friends were aware of their same-\nsex attractions were then asked about the extent to which they felt that these friends, overall, were \naccepting of their same-sex attractions.  Response options ranged from 1 to 9 (1 = not at all \naccepting, 2, 3 = somewhat, 4, 5 = mostly, 6, 7 = very, 8, 9 = fully).  Similar questions were presented \nto those who reported that at least some of their heterosexual contacts (apart from friends) were \naware and to those who reported their mother’s, father’s or siblings’ knowledge of their same-sex \nattractions.  In cases where a family member was deceased, participants were asked to consider how \nthey felt now about that family member’s level of acceptance at the time the family member was still \nalive.  Comment boxes were also provided in which participants could explain their relationship with \na particular family member, should they prefer to do so (e.g., “I have never met my father/mother”, \n“my mother is a lesbian”, “I have two mothers”, “my mother/father died before I ‘came out’”, “my \nbrother is gay”).  Table 24 lists the numbers of participants and average scores for each area of \nacceptance by age group.  As the numbers who reported being ‘out’ in these areas varied, the \nnumbers of participants for each of the acceptance measures varied accordingly.  In some cases, \nnumbers were relatively small (e.g., 60+ age group for father’s acceptance) limiting the statistical \npower of some group comparisons.  Figure 40, following Table 24, provides a visual interpretation of \nthis data. \nTable 24.  \n \nAverage scores (1 = not at all accepting to 9 = fully) and number of participants for perceptions of \nacceptance by others according to age group \n Heterosexual \nFriends \nHeterosexual \nContacts Mother Father Siblings \n \n18 - 19 (114) 7.34 (82) 5.57 (93) 5.77 (75) 5.69 (83) 6.99  \n20 - 29 (617) 7.74 (498) 6.10 (535) 6.23 (454) 6.04 (503) 7.10  \n30 - 39 (525) 7.91 (475) 6.13 (487) 6.38 (410) 6.38 (476) 7.18  \n40 - 49  (425) 8.14 (408) 6.15 (382) 6.68 (325) 6.23 (409) 7.04  \n50 - 59 (205) 7.72 (193) 5.80 (173) 6.40 (125) 5.92 (188) 7.12  \n60 + (60-82) (76) 6.92 (60) 5.70 (46) 5.80 (26) 5.19 (61) 6.08  \nTotal (1962) 7.81    (1716) 6.05 (1716) 6.35 (1415) 6.14 (1720) 7.07  \nMissing data         (3)              (8)    (4)    (3)    (2)  \nNote:  Number of participants is provided in brackets ( ).

These findings, overall, suggest that perceptions of acceptance may \nincrease with age for certain sectors.  A frequent comment made by participants in the ‘comment \nboxes’ provided was that others seemed to become more accepting as time went by (e.g., “She had \nan extremely difficult time accepting this, however now accepts my partner as a member of the \nfamily”).  Analyses comparing all six age groups, however, once again found a clear exception for \nthose aged 60 and over.  As a group they perceived significantly less acceptance from their \nheterosexual friends and their siblings compared with all other age groups except those 18-19 years \nof age (see Figure 40).  Although scores for acceptance from friends and siblings for those aged 60 \nand over were also lower than the scores for 18-19 year olds, the differences in these cases were not \nstatistically significant.  This pattern, showing a marked difference for the most senior group of \nparticipants, was similar to that discussed previously regarding the proportion of heterosexual \nfriends and contacts aware of one’s same-sex attractions (see Figure 39).  As noted earlier in this \nchapter, these individuals were more likely to have experienced higher levels or prejudice and \ndiscrimination regarding their sexuality, relative to younger generations.  Further, senior sexual \nminority individuals, relative to younger, are more likely to be in contact with heterosexual \nindividuals from an older generation.  Research, including recent findings from Australia (Galaxy, \n2009; Newspoll, 2006), showed that less favourable views of homosexuality and same-sex \nrelationships are still more likely to be held by those in more senior age groups (e.g., 50 yrs and \nabove).   \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     75 \n \n9.2.2 Overall Perceptions of Acceptance \nDespite these differences between age groups, perceptions of acceptance were overall relatively \nhigh, with 84.4% having reported that their heterosexual friends were ‘very’ to ‘fully’ accepting \n(average scores for acceptance are provided in Table 25 with scores for transgender/transsexual and \nintersex participants).  Although only 44.4% perceived their heterosexual contacts to be ‘very’ to \n‘fully’ accepting, near double this figure (88.2%) reported that they were ‘mostly’ to ‘fully’ accepting.  \nAmong those ‘out’ to family members, siblings generally appeared to be a good source of support \nwith over two-thirds (69.3%) of participants having rated their siblings as ‘very’ to ‘fully’ accepting.  \nAlthough a smaller majority reported that their mothers (56.9%) and fathers (53.2%) were ‘very’ to \n‘fully’ accepting, just over a three quarters indicated that mothers and fathers were ‘mostly’ to ‘fully’ \naccepting.  Nonetheless, 23.3% reported that their mothers and 24.4% reported that their fathers \nwere less than ‘mostly’ accepting.  Approximately a quarter of these individuals were under the age \nof 25.  Findings such as these continue to be of concern, particularly when it comes to a lack of \nparental acceptance for those in their youth.  Further, the many stories provided by the participants \nin this survey were a stark reminder of the contrasting experiences of acceptance and rejection.  For \nexample, some wrote of their parents being fully accepting of both them and their partners, and how \nthey were proud of them until the day they died, while others told of how they were described as \nbeing evil by their parents, who have not spoken with them since.   \n9.3 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \nBefore discussing the findings for transgender/transsexual and intersex participants, it is \nacknowledged that trying to isolate perceptions of acceptance of one’s same-sex attractions from \nperceptions of acceptance based on gender identity and biological sex would be extremely difficult, if \nnot near impossible.  This issue was acknowledged in the survey.  The responses from these \nparticipants are, therefore, likely to be influenced by their overall sexual minority status.   \nRelative to the general sample, perceptions of acceptance were in many cases lower for \ntransgender/transsexual and intersex participants.  This appeared to be particularly so when it came \nto acceptance from siblings, and a father’s acceptance for transgender/transsexual participants.  It is \nimportant to keep in mind, particularly when the number of participants are small for certain groups, \nthat average scores were based on responses from only those who reported others were aware of \ntheir attractions for each of the five areas assessed (refer to Table 25).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     76 \n \nTable 25. \n \nAverage scores for perceptions of acceptance from others (1 = not at all accepting to 9 = fully) for \ntransgender/transsexual and intersex participants, and the general sample \n H Friends H Contacts Mother Father Siblings \nTrans - F  (N = 11) (11)6.91  (10) 5.30 (7) 5.29 (9)3.56 (10) 4.50 \nTrans - M (N = 7) (7)7.86  (7) 6.57 (6) 6.50 (5) 4.80 (7) 6.86 \nIntersex - F (N = 5) (5) 6.20 (3) 7.00 (5) 6.60 (2) 8.00 (5) 5.40  \nIntersex - M (N =2) (2) 6.00 a a a a \nNote:  Averages are based on responses from the number of participants (presented in brackets) who \nreported others were aware of their same-sex attractions for each of the five domains.                                         \na = Figures are not provided as doing so would identify participants’ scores due to the small     \nnumber of cases.

What was of further interest, however, was the extent to which feeling \naccepted was related to well-being, when first taking into account the level of support received from \nsimilar others.  For example, does acceptance from family, friends and the mainstream community \nstill play a role for those who feel that they already receive support from other sexual-minority \nindividuals?  Results showed that this was in fact the case and built on similar findings from an earlier \nsmaller scale study (Dane & MacDonald, 2009), conducted by two of the researchers involved in the \ncurrent survey.  Figures 41 to 43 provide a visual interpretation of the current survey’s findings with \nresults discussed in further detail in section 9.4.1. \nFigure 41. \n \nThe contribution of heterosexual friends and heterosexual contacts acceptance in addition to \nGLBTI friends’ and GLBTI community support in predicting overall well-being  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH = heterosexual, GLBTI = gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, N = number of participants \n \n \nN = 1889 N = 1656 \nN = 1188 \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     78 \n \nWell-being \nMother's \nAcceptance \n4.2%\nGLBTI \nFriends' \nSupport \n2.8%\nWell-being Father's \nAcceptance \n5.1%\nGLBTI \nFriends' \nSupport \n2.9%\nWell-being \nSiblings' \nAcceptance \n3.3%\nGLBTI \nFriends' \nSupport \n3.3%\nFigure 42. \n \nThe contribution of family acceptance in addition to GLBTI support in predicting scores on overall \nwell-being \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH = heterosexual, GLBTI = gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, N = number of participants \n9.4.1 Interpretation of Findings on the Roles of Acceptance in Addition to GLBTI Support \nAs the areas in which participants reported that others were knowledgeable of their same-sex \nattractions varied, separate analyses11 (represented by each Venn diagram) were conducted for each \narea of acceptance, with numbers of participants varying accordingly.  Additionally, 38 participants \ndid not fully complete the questions on well-being and were therefore not included in this set of \nanalyses.  The percent figure provided in each of the ‘acceptance’ and ‘support’ circles represents the \nunique contribution of these measures in predicting well-being when taking both of these factors \ninto account.  The results in all cases showed that ‘GLBTI support’ significantly predicted well-being \nand that perceptions of acceptance from each of the five areas assessed in this survey, significantly \n                                                          \n11\n Separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted for each of the five areas of acceptance. \nThe percentages represent the unique proportion of variance in well-being scores predicted by the acceptance \nand GLBTI support variables.  In each case GLBTI support significantly predicted well-being, and acceptance \nsignificantly added to this prediction.  GLBTI support remained a significant predictor with the addition of the \nacceptance variables. There were no significant interactions found between the acceptance and support \nvariables.  A multiple regression analysis, in which all variables were considered when working together, is \ndiscussed in section 9.4.2.  \nN = 1658 N = 1372 \nN = 1655 \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     79 \n \nWell-being H Friends \nAcceptance \n4.6%\nGLBTI \nFriends' \nSupport \n1.3%\nPartner  \nSupport  \n4.2% Well-being Mother's \nAcceptance \n2.9%\nGLBTI \nFriends' \nSupport \n1.3%\nPartner  \nSupport  \n5.0%\nWell-being Father's \nAcceptance \n3.3%\nGLBTI \nFriends' \nSupport \n1.5%\nPartner  \nSupport  \n5.3%\nadded to the prediction of well-being.  These findings held even when taking into account the level \nof perceived ‘GLBTI support’.  For perceptions of acceptance from heterosexual friends and from \none’s father, results showed that although these factors predicted well-being in addition to support \nfrom GLBTI friends for both male and female participants, acceptance from these sources were more \nstrongly related to the reported well-being of those identifying as male.  For participants with a \nsame-sex partner, separate analyses revealed that perceived acceptance from heterosexual friends, \ncontacts, mother, father and siblings significantly added to the prediction of well-being even when \ntaking into account the reported level of support received from one’s same-sex partner and GLBTI \nfriends.  Examples of these findings are presented in Figure 43.    \nFigure 43. \n \nThe contribution of heterosexual friends’ and parents’ acceptance in addition to support from \none’s same-sex partner and GLBTI friends in predicting overall well-being  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH= heterosexual, GLBTI = gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, N = number of participants \n \n \n \nN = 1275 \nN = 982 \nN = 1166 \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     80 \n \n9.4.2 Acceptance and GLBTI Support for Those Partnered and ‘Out’ in All Areas \nA separate analysis was conducted for participants who reported having a same-sex partner, GLBTI \nfriends, and reported that people were aware of their same-sex attractions in all areas assessed in \nthis survey (N = 846).  Results revealed that support from one’s same-sex partner was the strongest \npredictor of well-being, followed by acceptance from heterosexual contacts (apart from friends).  \nPerhaps for individuals who have already dealt with the hurdles of ‘coming out’ to heterosexual \nfriends and family, acceptance from the wider heterosexual community takes on a new importance.  \nThese findings were consistent with those from an earlier study conducted by two of the researchers \ninvolved in the current survey (Dane & MacDonald, 2009).  \n9.4.3 Acceptance and Relationship Status and Longevity \nFindings also showed that perceptions of acceptance from heterosexual friends, parents and siblings \npredicted whether participants were currently in an ongoing same-sex relationship.  Specifically, the \nmore people felt accepted in relation to their sexuality, the greater was the likelihood of them having \nreported that they had a regular partner.  Further, and when first taking into account age differences, \nparticipants with a regular partner who felt more accepted by their heterosexual friends and siblings \nwere more likely to have reported a current relationship of a longer duration.  \n9.4.4 Concluding Comment  \nUnlike (heterosexual) racial/ethnic minority group members, sexual minority individuals may be less \nlikely to experience the same sense of belonging provided by a shared minority status with family  \nand similar community members (e.g., neighbours).  Telljohann and Price (1993) noted that even \nwhen faced with high levels of social rejection, racial/ethnic and religious minority youth often had \nthe opportunity to receive strong family support in relation to their subculture and identity.  This \ncritical difference may help explain why several racial/ethnic minority groups have been found to \nhave equivalent, and in some cases higher, levels of well-being when compared with the dominant \npopulation (e.g., Breslau et al., 2006).  This is not to suggest that sexual minority individuals lack \nresilience or that support from like-minded others is inferior by comparison.  Further, in no instances \ndo the results presented in this chapter suggest that perceptions of heterosexual acceptance are \nmore important than GLBTI support.  Rather, and due to the unique socialisation of sexual minorities, \nthey simply suggest that even in the presence of receiving support from similar others, feeling \naccepted by one’s family, heterosexual friends and the wider community still play important roles in \nsame-sex attracted people’s psychological well-being.  The figures presented in all Venn diagrams \nrepresent the factors that uniquely contributed to the prediction of well-being when they were \nconsidered together.  These findings concur with the argument that although support from other \nsexual minority individuals appears to be critical, this support is likely to be most beneficial when \ncomplemented by mainstream acceptance (Dane & MacDonald, 2009).   \n \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     81 \n \n10. Stigma and Psychological Well-Being \nThis chapter focuses on participants’ scores on various measures of psychological well-being, \nincluding perceptions of stigma in relation to being same-sex attracted.  Well-being has been \nfrequently discussed within this report in the context of how it relates to several other factors \nmeasured in this survey.  For example, the relationship between well-being and the disclosure of \none’s sexuality is discussed in Chapter 4.  The relationship between well-being and perceptions of \nhow others value a person’s same-sex relationship is discussed in Chapter 5, and its association with \nrelationship satisfaction is discussed in Chapter 7.  Well-being and connection to the GLBTI \ncommunity is discussed in Chapter 8 and the findings on the relationship between well-being and \nperceptions of acceptance, in addition to GLBTI support, are discussed in Chapter 9.   \n10.1 Perceived Stigma \nParticipants were asked about the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with a series of \nstatements relating to their perceptions of the stigma associated with nonheterosexuality.  The      \n11-item scale was originally designed by Link (1987) in relation to mental illness and adapted by \nMartin and Dean (1987) to relate to the expectations of rejection and discrimination of homosexuals. \nIt has been found to be a reliable measure when used with this population12 (e.g., Meyer, 1995).  For \nthe purpose of the current survey, the word “homosexual” was replaced with the words “same-sex \nattracted person”.  The response options were 1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree.    \nResponses indicated that most participants felt that people with same-sex attractions were \nstigmatised to some extent.  Of the 2,025 participants who responded to all 11 items, 84% agreed \n(between slightly and strongly) with at least one negative statement or disagreed (between slightly \nand strongly) with at least one positive statement.  The circumstances for which participants \nappeared to have the highest perception of stigma were for those relating to the care of children.  \nFor example, 63.3% disagreed to some extent that most people would accept a same-sex attracted \nperson as a teacher in a public school and 47.4% agreed to some extent that most people will not \nhire a same-sex attracted person to care for their children.  In contrast, perceptions in relation to \nemployment were much more positive.  For example, 78.4% agreed to some extent that most \nemployers will hire a same-sex attracted person if he or she is qualified for the job.  Table 26 on the \nfollowing page lists all 11 items and provides the percentages for those agreeing or disagreeing with \neach statement.  Within this table, for ease of interpretation, the ‘strongly agree’ and ‘moderately \nagree’ responses were combined into a single ‘agree’ category, and the ‘strongly disagree’ and \n‘moderately disagree’ responses into a single ‘disagree’ category. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n12\n In the Meyer (1995) study involving gay men, the reported internal reliability coefficient for the Stigma scale \nwas α = .86.  In the current survey, the internal reliability coefficient was α = .89. \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     82 \n \nTable 26. \n \nPercentages of participants agreeing or disagreeing with statements on perceived stigma \n Agree Slightly Agree Slightly Disagree Disagree  \n \n“Most people would willingly \naccept a same-sex attracted \nperson as a close friend.” 36.5% 31.5% 20.3% 11.6%  \n      “Most people believe that a \nsame-sex attracted person is \njust as intelligent as the \naverage person.” 68.3% 18.3% 9.6% 3.8%  \n      “Most people believe that a \nsame-sex attracted person is \njust as trustworthy as the \naverage citizen.” 50.7% 25.0% 15.5% 8.8%  \n      “Most people would accept a \nsame-sex attracted person as \na teacher of young children in \na public school.” 15.2% 21.7% 25.5% 37.6%  \n      “Most people think that being \nsame-sex attracted is a sign of \npersonal failure.” 8.7% 15.5% 23.6% 52.3%  \n      “Most people will not hire a \nsame-sex attracted person to \ncare for their children.” 24.5% 22.9% 25.6% 27.0%  \n      “Most people think less of a \nsame-sex attracted person.”  13.5% 24.3% 25.2% 36.9%  \n      “Most employers will hire a \nsame-sex attracted person if \nhe or she is qualified for the \njob.” 55.7% 22.7% 14.6% 7.0%  \n      “Most employers will pass \nover the application of a \nsame-sex attracted person in \nfavour of another applicant.”  9.9% 16.5% 24.7% 48.9%  \n      “Most people in the \ncommunity would treat a \nsame-sex attracted person \njust as they would treat \nanyone.” 25.7% 24.6% 25.5% 24.1%  \n      Once they know a person is \nsame-sex attracted they will \ntake her or his opinion less \nseriously.” 8.3% 15.5% 28.5% 47.6%  \nNote: The ‘strongly agree’ and ‘moderately agree’ responses are presented as a single ‘agree’ \ncategory, and the ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘moderately disagree ‘responses as a single ‘disagree’ \ncategory.

Herek (2009), based on a national sample from the United States, likewise found little \ndifference between gay men, lesbians, bisexual men and bisexual women when using a modified and \nshortened version of the same scale.  Both males and females in the current survey, however, \nreported significantly lower levels of perceived stigma compared with gender different participants \n(3.40).  When taking into account a person’s age and gender identity, the results revealed a trend \nwhich indicated that these differences were mainly associated with the higher level of stigma \nreported by gender different participants of a younger age (see Figure 44).   \nFigure 44. \n \nAverage scores, by age group, for the three gender identity groups for perceptions of stigma in \nrelation to same-sex attractions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.1.2 Stigma and Urban vs. Rural Areas of Residence \nPerceptions of stigma were not significantly related to the area (e.g., rural, metropolitan) in which \nparticipants resided (see Table 1, section 1.1 for a description of area of residence).  Although \nresearch has found that people living in rural areas are more likely to have negative attitudes \ntowards homosexuality (Swank & Raiz, 2007), same-sex attracted people living in large cities may be \nmore likely to experience different types of discrimination and abuse compared with those living in \nregional and remote areas.  For example, findings from the Australian national Private Lives survey \n(Pitt et al., 2006) showed that those living in major cities, where sexual minorities are visible in larger \nnumbers, were more likely to report personal insults or verbal abuse than people living in less \npopulated areas.  In contrast, people living in outer regional Australia were more likely to have \nreported experiencing threats of violence or physical attack relative to those in other areas.  Put \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     84 \n \nsimply, perhaps living in a highly populated area exposes one to more frequent homophobic \nbehaviour even if, on average, it is less severe than that experienced in rural and remote areas.  \nAnother possibility, of course, is that people living in rural areas may be more likely to perceive high \nperceptions of stigma, be less open about their sexuality, and therefore may be less likely to \nparticipate in surveys of this nature.  \n10.1.3 Stigma, GLBTI Support and Well-being \nFeeling supported by GLBTI friends and the GLBTI community were significantly related to lower \nlevels of perceived stigma and higher levels of well-being.  Research conducted with racial minority \ngroups (e.g., Postmes & Branscombe, 2002) suggests that experiencing higher levels of support from \nsimilar others may work as a buffer against the negative effects of feeling devalued by the dominant \npopulation.  In the case of concealable stigmas, however, such as sexual orientation, those who feel \nmore devalued may be less inclined to want to seek high levels of support from similar others, for \nfear of increased visibility leading to further stigmatisation (Miller & Major, 2000). This could also \nexplain the relationship found in the current survey between lower perceptions of stigma and higher \nperceptions of GLBTI support.  \n10.1.4 Transgender, Transsexual, and Intersex Participants \nAs discussed previously, it is unlikely that a transgender, transsexual, or intersex individual would be \nable to neatly disentangle their perceptions of acceptance or non-acceptance based on sexual \norientation from the additional hurdles they are likely to face as sexual minorities (Lombardi, \nWilchins, Priesing, & Malouf, 2001).  It is not surprising, therefore, that average scores for \nperceptions of stigma were somewhat higher for this group when compared with the general sample \n(see Table 27).  For example, 75.7% of participants from the general sample agreed, at least to some \nextent, that most people felt that a same-sex attracted person was trustworthy. Only 54.6% of \ntransgender/transsexual female participants and 40.0% of intersex female participants agreed, at \nleast to some extent, with this statement. \nTable 27. \n \nPerceived stigma scores for transgender/transsexual and intersex participants \n Average score 50% =>  \nTrans - F  (N = 11) 3.35 3.27   \nTrans - M (N = 7) 3.08  2.27  \nIntersex - F (N = 5) 3.62 3.82  \nIntersex - M (N =2) 3.09 a  \n a = Figures are not provided as doing so would identify participants’ scores due to the small     \nnumber of cases.

For this survey, \nparticipants were asked to rate how they feel “in general” (i.e., on average) when presented with 10 \npositive adjectives (interested, excited, strong, enthusiastic, proud, alert, inspired, determined, \nattentive, and active) and 10 negative adjectives (distressed, upset, guilty, scared, hostile, irritable, \nashamed, nervous, jittery, and afraid).  Response options ranged from 1 = very slightly or not at all to \n5 = extremely.  Of the sample, 2,018 participants completed items on both scales (as three \nparticipants did not provide their age, 2,015 are represented in the Figures 45 and 46). \nThe highest average scores for negative feelings (i.e., greater extent of a particular negative mood) \nwere found for the adjectives “irritable” (2.41) and “nervous” (2.36), whereas the lowest scores for \nnegative feelings were found for the adjectives “ashamed” (1.55) and “hostile” (1.70).  The highest \naverage scores for positive feelings were found for the adjectives “interested” (4.00), “determined” \n(3.93) and “proud” (3.81) and the lowest average score for positive feelings was found for the \nadjective “excited” (3.43).  \n10.2.1 Age and Gender Identity Differences \nAverage PANAS scores (ranging from 10 to 50) for the positive and negative mood scales represent \nthe sum of the average scores for each scale’s items.  Consistent with research findings based on a \nsample from the Australian general population (MacKinnon et al., 1999), greater negative mood was \nsignificantly associated with being younger.  Gender different participants reported significantly \ngreater negative mood (average score = 24.11) when compared with those who identified as male \n(20.10) or female (19.30), with differences still significant when taking into account participants’ \nages.  When taking into account age, there were also significant differences found between male and \nfemale participants.  Males reported significantly higher negative mood, relative to females, with this \ndifference more likely to be between males and females of an older age (see Figure 45).   \nGreater positive mood was significantly associated with being of an older age (see Figure 46).  This \nlatter finding is not consistent with those involving participants from the Australian general \npopulation (e.g., MacKinnon et al., 1999) in which younger people were found to report not only \nhigher levels of negative mood on the negative PANAS subscale but also higher levels of positive \nmood on the positive PANAS subscale14.  The average scores for the current survey were 37.50 for \nparticipants identifying as female, 36.91 for participants identifying as male, and 35.36 for gender \ndifferent participants.  When taking into account age differences, these gender differences for \npositive mood were not statistically significant.  \n                                                          \n13\n The positive and negative affect subscales of the PANAS have been found to have good internal consistency \nwith the internal reliability coefficient ranging from α = .83 to α = .90 for Positive Affect and α = .85 to α = .90 \nfor Negative Affect (Watson & Clark, 1994). For the current survey the internal reliability coefficients were α = \n.88 and α = .90 respectively.    \n14\n The PANAS subscales have been found to be quasi-independent (Watson & Clark, 1994), such that \nparticipants may score high on the positive affect subscale while still scoring high on the negative affect \nsubscale. \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     86 \n \n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n18-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60+\nH\nig\nh\ner\n a\nve\nra\nge\n s\nco\nre\n =\n h\nig\nh\ner\n n\neg\nat\niv\ne \nm\no\no\nd\nAge group\nfemale (N = 1117)\nmale (N = 851)\ngender different (N = 47)\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n18-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60+\nH\nig\nh\ner\n a\nve\nra\nge\n s\nco\nre\n =\n h\nig\nh\ner\n p\no\nsi\nti\nve\n \nm\no\no\nd\nAge Group\nfemale (N = 1117)\nmale (N = 851)\ngender different (N = 47)\nFigure 45. \n \nAverage scores for the PANAS negative affect subscale by gender identity \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 46. \n \nAverage scores for the PANAS positive affect subscale by gender identity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNote: Average scores for gender different participants in the age group 50-59 represent two \nparticipants. \n \n \n \n \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     87 \n \n10.2.2 Comparative Figures (US national LGB sample and Australian random sample) \nData from a US national sample of gay, lesbian and bisexual adults, reported in a paper by Rostosky, \nRiggle, Horne, and Mille, (2009), were made available to the authors for comparative purposes \n(E.D.B. Riggle, personal communication, April 10, 2010).  Data from a random sample from the \"The \nStress and Well-Being Study\", undertaken by the Centre for Mental Health Research at the Australian \nNational University (ANU), were used to compare data from the current survey with that \nrepresenting the general Australian population (T. Jacomb, personal communication, April 12, 2010).  \nThe ANU data, as described here, were based on figures provided in a study by MacKinnon et al., \n(1999).  As the MacKinnon et al. (1999) study analysed a short 5-item version of the PANAS subscales, \nthe scores for all three studies (see Table 28, Figures 47 and 48) have been presented as overall \naverages15, rather than a sum of item averages, to allow for comparisons between samples.  The \nfindings reported here, however, need to be interpreted with caution.  Although the age ranges for \nthe three samples were similar16, results do not take into account possible demographic differences.  \nOverall, the results based on the three samples showed that nonheterosexual participants reported \ngreater negative emotional experiences, but not less positive emotional experiences, relative to a \nrandom sample from Australia.  Female participants from the US national LGB survey scored \nsignificantly higher on the PANAS negative mood subscale compared with females from the random \nsample from Australia.  Average scores for negative mood were similar between female participants \nfrom the current survey and those from the Australian sample, however, when including only the 5 \nitems used in the Canberra study, female participants from the current survey also scored \nsignificantly higher for negative mood.17 18 Negative mood scores for male participants from the US \nnational LGB survey and those from the current survey were similar, however, male participants from \nboth these samples reported significantly higher negative mood relative to male participants from \nthe Australian random sample.  Gender different participants reported significantly higher negative \nmood relative to all other groups (see Figure 47). \nFor the PANAS positive mood subscale, scores for the US sample, the Australian random sample, and \nfor gender different participants in the current survey were comparable.  Both male and female \nparticipants from the current survey, however, reported significantly higher positive mood when \ncompared with their counterparts from the Australian and US samples (see Figure 48).  One possible \nexplanation for the higher positive mood scores for the Australian same-sex attracted male and \nfemale participants, at least when compared with the US sample, is that the current survey asked \nparticipants about how they felt “in general” in relation to the 10 positive PANAS items (e.g., proud, \ndetermined, inspired).  For the US study, participants were asked to rate how they felt “during the \nprevious few weeks”.  Comparisons between studies using the PANAS over different time frames \n                                                          \n15\n Average scores can be converted to a sum of item averages by multiplying these scores by 10 for the Not So \nPrivate Lives sample and the US LGB sample, and by 5 for the ANU Canberra sample.  \n16\n The age range for participants from the ANU study, reported in MacKinnon et al., (1999), was 18-79 and the \nmean age was 42.2 (SD = 14.0). The age range for the US national LGB study (Rostosky et al., 2009) was 18-82 \nand the mean age was 39.1  (SD =12.8). For the current Not So Private Lives survey, the age range was likewise \n18-82 and the mean age was 35.8 (SD = 12.3).  \n17\n Analyses for the current survey were also conducted using only the 5 items used in the ANU study. Scores for \npositive affect remained unchanged, however, scores for negative affect increased for females from 1.93 to \n2.03 (SD = .820), males from 2.01 to 2.08 (SD = .860) and gender different from 2.41 to 2.56 (SD = 1.102).  \n18\n T-tests were conducted to analyse differences between groups.  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     88 \n \nindicated that scores tend to increase as the time frame considered lengthens (Watson & Clark, \n1994).  One of the studies included in Watson and Clark’s (1994) comparison involved Australian men \nand women who, when presented with the PANAS subscales, were asked to rate how they felt “over \nthe last week” as well as how they felt “in general”.  Findings showed that scores were higher for \npositive mood when feelings were considered “in general” compared with the one week assessment, \nand that this increase related to only positive mood scores not negative mood scores (Wilkinson, \n1993; cited in Watson & Clark, 1994).  Table 28 below lists the average scores (and standard \ndeviations) for the three samples while Figures 47 and 48 allow for a visual interpretation of these \nresults.   \nTable 28.  \n \nAverage scores for the PANAS positive affect and negative affect subscales by gender identity and \ncomparative figures based on a randomly selected Australian sample and a US national LGB sample \n N PANAS - Positive    PANAS - Negative   \nNSPL – LGBTI sample     \nFemale  1118 3.75 (.645)  1.93 (.719)  \nMale  853 3.69 (.703)  2.01 (.767)  \nGender different  47 3.54 (.809) 2.41 (.992)  \n     \nAust. random sample     \nFemale  1389 3.44 (.668) 1.92 (.814)  \nMale  1262 3.47 (.626) 1.70 (.656)  \n     \nUS LGB sample     \nFemale  958 3.41 (.764) 2.07 (.729)  \nMale  724 3.50 (.699) 2.00 (.666)  \nStandard deviations are provided in brackets ().

In keeping with the overall general \nsample (see Figure 48), scores for positive mood were relatively high.  Scores for negative mood for \ntransgender/transsexual female and intersex female participants, however, were higher relative to \nthe general sample and were more in keeping with those found for gender different participants (see \nFigure 47).  These higher scores for negative emotional experiences are consistent with the higher \nscores found in the current survey on perceptions of stigma for transgender/transsexual female, \nintersex female and gender different participants (see section 10.1.4).  \nTable 29. \n \nAverage scores for the PANAS positive affect and negative affect subscales by gender identity and \ncomparative figures based on a randomly selected Australian sample and a US national LGB sample \n  Positive Mood  Negative Mood  \nTrans - F  (N = 11) 3.61 (.822)  2.43 (.648)   \nTrans - M (N = 7) 3.74 (.860)  2.01 (1.229)  \nIntersex - F (N = 5) 3.42 (.867) 2.98 (.976)  \nIntersex - M (N =2) 4.00 (.707) 1.95 (.919)  \nNote: Higher scores represent higher mood states.

Scores for the positive PANAS subscale for same-sex attracted \nparticipants from a US national LGB survey (Rostosky et al., 2009) and the current national survey \nwere comparable, and in some cases higher, when compared with those from the random Australian \nsample.  In the case of negative emotional experiences, however, same-sex attracted participants \nfrom the US survey and the current survey scored higher on the negative PANAS subscale, although \nthis finding was less pronounced in the case of same-sex attracted female participants relative to \ntheir female counterparts from the Canberra study.  While acknowledging numbers are small, of \ngreatest concern, and consistent with higher scores in the current survey on perceptions of stigma, \nwere the higher levels of negative emotional experiences reported by gender different, intersex \nfemale, and transgender/transsexual female participants.   \n \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     91 \n \n10.3 Psychological Well-Being Scales (PWB) \nParticipants were presented with the 42-item version of the Scales of Psychological Well-Being  \n(PWB: Ryff, 1989), which have been used across various age groups and translated to over 25 \ndifferent languages (MIDUS, 2010).  The scales, which focus on positive psychological functioning, \nrepresent six dimensions of well-being: Self-Acceptance – positive evaluation of oneself and one’s \npast life, Purpose in Life – the belief that one’s life is purposeful and meaningful, Autonomy – a sense \nof self-determination, Environmental Mastery – the capacity to effectively manage one’s life and \nsurrounding world, Personal Growth – a sense of continued growth and development as a person, \nPositive Relations with Others – the possession of quality relations with others.  Participants were \nasked about the extent to which they agreed or disagreed (1= strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree) \nwith seven statements for each of these dimensions.  Responses to negatively worded statements \nwere reversed scored such that higher scores indicate greater well-being.  \n10.3.1 Age and Gender Identity Differences \nWhen considering scores on all six dimensions of psychological well-being combined (i.e., overall \nwell-being) older participants were significantly more likely to report higher well-being than younger \nparticipants.  Those identifying as female reported significantly higher well-being compared with \ngender different participants and those identifying as male.  Gender different participants reported \nsignificantly lower well-being relative to both male and female participants (see Figure 55).  Figures \n49 through to 54 present the average scores for each of the six dimensions of psychological          \nwell-being by gender identity and age group.  For each of the six dimensions, older participants were \nmore likely to report significantly higher levels of well-being compared with younger.  Female \nparticipants scored significantly higher than male participants for Personal Growth and significantly \nhigher than both male and gender different participants for Positive Relations with Others and \nPurpose in Life.  Gender different participants scored significantly lower than female participants for \nPurpose in Life and significantly lower than both female and male participants for Environmental \nMastery, Positive Relations with Others, and Self-Acceptance.  The only dimension for which no \nsignificant gender identity differences were found was Autonomy19. \nAn evaluation of scores on the Scales of Psychological Well-being (PWB), from multiple sources, has \nshown that females in general tend to rate themselves higher on the Positive Relations with Others \nand Personal Growth dimensions (Ryff, 1995).  Female scores for the current survey, however, were \nalso higher for Purpose in Life and well-being overall.  These higher female scores may, at least in \npart, relate to the more overt prejudice same-sex attracted males appear to face when compared \nwith their female counterparts.  Research from the Australian Private Lives GLBTI survey (Pitt et al., \n2006) revealed that greater percentages of male participants, relative to female, reported acts of \nviolence, and threats of violence or intimidation, with regard to their sexuality.  Research has also \nfound higher levels of prejudice towards gay men from other men than towards lesbians from other \nwomen (e.g., Herek, 2000).   \n                                                          \n19\n Results described above are based on analyses of scores from participants who completed all items on all six \nwell-being dimensions (N =1991).  Additional analyses were conducted for each dimension, based on \nparticipants who completed all items on that particular dimension.

For this dimension, differences between male and \nfemale scores went from being close to significant to significant, with females having scored higher. \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     92 \n \n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n18-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60+\nA\nve\nra\nge\n s\nco\nre\n f\no\nr \nse\nlf\n-a\ncc\nep\nta\nn\nce\nAge group\nfemale (N=1102)\nmale (N=844)\ngender different (N=45)\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n18-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60+\nA\nve\nra\nge\n s\nco\nre\n f\no\nr \np\nu\nrp\no\nse\n in\n li\nfe\nAge group\nfemale (N=1102)\nmale (N=844)\ngender different (N=45)\nThe significantly lower scores for gender different participants on four out of the six well-being \ndimensions is of great concern, particularly as these findings are consistent with this group’s \nsignificantly higher scores on perceived stigma and negative emotional experiences, when compared \nwith participants identifying as male or female.

Information on the use of these scales and how best to convert scores20 based on \nthe 7-point scale response format used in the MIDUS II survey to a 6-point scale response format \nused for the current survey was provided by the author of these scales, Professor Ryff (C. D. Ryff, \npersonal communication, April 9, 2010). As the MIDUS II sample represented a larger number of \nparticipants in their senior years, scores were examined between a subsample of participants aged \n30-60 from the MIDUS II dataset and a subsample of participants aged 30-60 from the current \nsurvey.  Due to the mean age of the MIDUS sample still being higher, an additional subsample from \nthe current survey, which included all participants aged 30 and over (i.e., 30-82), was also compared.  \nAs the number of participants over the age of 60 in the current NSPL sample was relatively small      \n(n = 81), the average age for the two NSPL subsamples differed only slightly.  \nResults based on comparisons with the raw data from the MIDUS II survey showed that participants \nfrom the current survey (for both subsamples) scored significantly lower21 than the subsample of \nAmerican heterosexual participants22  for Environmental Mastery, Purpose in Life and Self-\nAcceptance, and significantly higher for Personal Growth.  These findings are similar to those based \non a comparison by Riggle, Rostosky, and Danner (2009) of scores between American heterosexual \nparticipants and American nonheterosexual participants from the earlier MIDUS I dataset.  Riggle and \ncolleagues (2009) found that the sexual minority subsample scored lower on the same dimensions \nfound for the current survey with the addition of Positive Relations with Others.  Interestingly, \nPersonal Growth was the one dimension for which they found sexual minority participants scored \nhigher, although, unlike the current findings, scores were not found to be significantly different from \nthe comparison group.   \nAlthough the consistencies found between the US findings for sexual minority participants’ scores \nand those from the current survey are of interest, the interpretation of these findings are limited due \nto the fact that demographic differences were not taken into account for the Australian comparison.  \nFurther, in order to make comparisons with the MIDUS II data, which were based on an older-age \nsample, sexual minority participants who were under the age of 30 were not included in the \nanalyses.  As younger people were more likely to report lower well-being for all six dimensions, it \nwould be of greater interest to compare reported psychological well-being between young \nheterosexual and young nonheterosexual national samples.  Importantly, although the findings \npresented here provide some evidence of reported lower well-being for sexual minority individuals \nfor certain aspects of well-being, results overall revealed that the majority of same-sex attracted \npeople in the current survey reported positive well-being.  Individuals who perceived higher levels of \n                                                          \n20\n To convert scores from the MIDUS II dataset based on a 7-point scale response format to a 6-point scale \nformat, half of the ‘neutral’ responses (i.e. a score of 4) were randomly assigned a score immediately above on \nthe scale (i.e., slightly agree) and half immediately below (i.e., slightly disagree).  Data were based on \nparticipants who completed all items on each of the 6 dimensions to be consistent with the current sample. \n21\n T-test were conducted to analyse differences between groups. \n22\n Participants who identified as ‘Homosexual’ or ‘Bisexual’ (the two nonheterosexual response options in the \nMIDUS II survey) were excluded from the MIDUS II subsample, in order to provide a heterosexual comparison.  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     97 \n \nstigma and lower levels of acceptance from others were more likely to report higher levels of \nnegative mood and lower levels of psychological well-being. \nTable 31. \n \nAverage scores for Scales of Psychological Well-Being (7-items per scale) for a subsample of \nheterosexual participants from the MIDUS II and subsamples from the current survey (NSPL) \n MIDUS II (30-60 yrs) NSPL (30-60 yrs) NSPL (30-82 yrs) \n  N = 2350 N = 1182 N = 1249 \n  30-60 yrs, M = 48.5 30-60 yrs, M = 41.7  30-82 yrs, M= 43.0 \n    \nAutonomy  31.51 (5.78) 31.56 (6.00) 31.58 (5.98) \n    \nEnvironmental  Mastery 32.10 (6.09) 31.41 (7.03) 31.53 (7.01) \n    \nPersonal Growth 33.06 (5.68) 35.35 (5.35) 35.32 (5.42) \n    \nPositive Relat. w/Others 34.24 (5.83) 33.91 (5.89) 33.92 (5.88) \n    \nPurpose in Life 33.12 (5.68) 32.44 (6.21) 32.47 (6.20) \n    \nSelf-Acceptance   32.17 (6.86) 31.27 (7.38) 31.35 (7.37) \n    \nOverall Well-being  196.19 (29.45) 195.93 (31.17) 196.18 (31.13) \nM = mean age \n10.3.3 Transgender, Transsexual and Intersex Participants \nSimilar to the scores for the general sample, transgender/transsexual and intersex participants \nscored highest for the Personal Growth dimension of well-being and lowest for Environment Mastery.  \nSimilar to gender different participants, however, scores were overall lower compared with male and \nfemale scores for the general sample, for all groups except intersex males23.

The aim of the survey \nwas to add to the growing body of research on the lives of sexual minorities in Australia.  The full \nreport of this survey is expected to be completed by November 2009.  The report provided here is \nbased on the analyses of responses to a sub-set of questions within the survey.  These questions \nfocused on current relationship status and preferences for relationship recognition.  The examination \nof these factors aimed to provide an insight into the preferences of same-sex attracted Australians \nwith regard to the legal recognition of their relationships following the introduction of  de facto \nstatus for same-sex couples at a federal level.   \nThe survey site was hosted by Globalpark through its Unipark program for academic research.  \nGlobalpark has its headquaters in Germany and is one of the leading international suppliers of online  \nsoftware for academic and commercial research.   All data collection and storage is provided by \nGlobalpark.  The url for the web-page entry to the survey was www.notsoprivatelives.com  \nRecruitment Strategies \nThe survey commenced on the 3rd April 2009 and ran until midnight, 15th August 2009.  Responses to \nthe survey decreased substantially in the latter two weeks, suggesting the sample had reached its \nmaximum uptake.  The survey was advertised online in the LGBTQI press for every state and territory \nand in print in various LGBTQI magazines.  Information on the survey was also circulated through \nsexual minority email networks across the country.   Flyers and/or email information were sent to \nsexual minority - businesses, health and community centres, sporting clubs, reading groups, \nparenting groups, outdoor activity groups, city and country social clubs, chat rooms, and sexual \nminority welcoming religious organisations.  The survey was also promoted via Queer radio  (e.g., JOY \nFM – Melbourne) and flyers were distributed at sexual minority events (e.g., Brisbane Pride Day and \nthe Brisbane Queer Film Ferstival).  Participants were also asked to consider informing their  same-\nsex attracted friends/contacts about the survey. \nEligibility \nParticipants were invited to take part in the survey provided they met the criteria of being: \na) at least 18 years of age   \nb) a citizen or permanent resident of Australia \nc) attracted (sexually and/or romantically) to people of the same sex \nParticipants, who did not select the ‘Yes’ option for all three of the questions addressing the criteria, \nwere thanked for their interest and directed away from the survey.   Identification as same-sex \nattracted was further verified by the Sexual Identity and Sexual and Romantic Attraction measures in \nthe survey proper.   \n \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     102 \n \nDemographics \nThe Preference for Legal Recognition of Same-Sex Relationships’ component of the survey \nwas completed by 2,232 participants in total.  Demographic information for these \nparticipants is provided below. \nFigure 1:  \nNumbers and percentages of respondents according to state/territory of residence \n \nAll participants acknowledged that they were either citizens or permanent residents of \nAustralia.  Thirty-three participants selected the ‘currently living overseas’ option and were \nasked to provide the name of their home state or territory in Australia.  These numbers (ACT \n- 3, NSW - 10, QLD - 8, VIC - 9 and WA - 3) are accounted for in Figure 1 above. The survey \nattracted a higher number of participants from Queensland, despite balancing advertising \nacross states and territories.  This is likely to have been as a result of the survey being \nconducted in Queensland and advertised under The University of Queensland logo. \nTable 1  \nNumbers and percentages of respondents according to area of current residence \n N % \nCapital City 1643 73.6 \nOther metropolitan area (population 100,000 or more)   316 14.2 \nLarge rural centre (25,000 – under 100,000)   144   6.5 \nOther rural area    111   5.0 \nRemote    18   0.8 \n Total N = 2232 \n \n11.51%\n18.41%\n2.06%\n5.6%\n28.41%\n0.9%\n27. 15%\n5.96%\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700\n1\nNumber of respondents\nA\nxi\ns \nSt\nat\ne\n/T\ne\nrr\nit\no\nry\nTi\ntl\ne\nACT (133)\nNSW (606)\nNT (20)\nQLD (634)\nSA (125)\nTAS (46)\nVIC (411)\nWA (257)\nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     103 \n \nAge \nThe mean age of this sample was 35.8 years with a range from 18 to 82 years.

When examining \nthe numbers of transgender, transsexual, intersex, and gender different participants, it is \nimportant to note that this survey was not open to all sexual minority individuals but only \nthose who identified as same-sex attracted.    \nTable 3 \nCurrent gender identity of respondents \n   Total N = 2232 \nThe most frequent responses for sexual identity were gay (40.9%), lesbian (37.9%), bisexual \n(8%), queer (5.7%) and no label (3.8%).

However, 41.6% of \nparticipants reported that religion (including the religious beliefs of others) plays a role in \ntheir decisions to disclose their sexuality. \nRelationship Measures \nOf the sample, 66.3% of participants reported currently being in some form of same-sex \nrelationship.

To minimise confusion, participants were provided with examples for \nrelationships formalised through a state or municipal registry in Australia.  These were ACT \nCivil Partnership, City of Melbourne Relationship Declaration, City of Sydney Relationship \nDeclaration, Tasmania Significant Relationship, Victoria Domestic Partnership and Yarra City \nCouncil Relationship Declaration.  Examples of relationships recognised overseas were \nprovided next to the relevant answer options (see Table 6 below).   \nTable 6 \nReported current legal status of same-sex relationship for respondents with a regular \nsame-sex partner, living together or apart (N = 1353). \n  Note:  Respondents were able to select more than one option. \n \nThe question asking participants how they would describe the legal status of their same-sex \nrelationship also provided the option of selecting ‘Other’.  Forty-eight participants (3.5%) \nselected this ‘Other’ option.  However, the majority of these participants (31 out of 48) had \nalso selected one of the categories listed in Table 6 above and simply utilised the ‘Other’ text \nbox to clarify their selection.  Three participants used the ‘Other’ option to state that they \nwere unsure about the legal status of their relationship and 13 did not make the legal status \nof their relationship clear in their description.   \nPreferred Legal Recognition of Same-Sex Relationship \nAll participants, regardless of whether or not they were currently in a same-sex relationship, \nwere asked about their personal preference for legal relationship recognition in this country.  \nFigure 2 below indicates the responses to the question “If you are or were to become \ninvolved in a long-term committed same-sex relationship, in what way would you prefer \nAustralian law to recognise your relationship? \n \n N % \nNo legal status  548 40.5 \nDe facto  719    53.1 \nRelationship formalised through a state or municipal registry \n(see examples above) \n  47    3.5 \nOverseas recognised relationship other than marriage (e.g., \nUK Civil Partnership, NZ Civil Union) \n  43   3.2 \nOverseas marriage (e.g., Canada, Netherlands, South Africa, \nMassachusetts) \n  23    1.7 \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     106 \n \nFigure 2 \nPersonal preference for relationship recognition - general sample (including those not \ncurrently in a same-sex relationship). \n \n \nSix participants stated that they preferred a Civil Union and three stated that they preferred \na Civil Partnership in the ‘Other’ text box provided.  As both types of relationships are forms \nof federally recognised relationships documented at a registry (other than marriage), these \nnine responses were included in the main category ‘Federally recognised registry- other than \nmarriage’.  Twenty-two participants selected the ‘not applicable’ option (e.g., never wish to \nbe in a long-term committed same-sex relationship) and were therefore excluded from the \nanalysis.  From the remaining sample of 2210, 149 participants selected the ‘Other’ option \nwith the most common statement used to clarify this selection being that they simply \nwanted the same rights as heterosexuals (e.g., “all ways permitted for opposite-sex \ncouples”, “exactly the same as heterosexual couples”).  These responses, although making \nan important statement, were more in keeping with a later question on a person’s general \npreference for relationship recognition in which participants could select more than one \nchoice.  Therefore, these responses, along with those from others who did not select a single \npreference as instructed by the question, were not included in this analysis.

It is also the first major study to investigate preferences for relationship \nrecognition while taking into account the current legal status (in Australia or overseas) of an \nindividual’s same-sex relationship. \nFindings from the relationship recognition measures of this survey demonstrate that same-sex \nattracted individuals, like other Australians, differ in the way they prefer their relationships to be \nformally recognised.  However, the results show that the majority of same-sex attracted participants \nin this survey selected marriage as their personal choice.  A federally recognised relationship \ndocumented at a registry other than marriage was the second most popular option, and de facto \nstatus was the third.  The preference for a relationship without any legal status was selected by only \n3% of the overall sample.   \nInterestingly, marriage was still the majority choice irrespective of the current legal status of \nparticipants’ same-sex relationships (including no legal status).  For example, of those currently in a \nde facto relationship, 55.4% stated they preferred marriage for themselves, 25.6% stated that they \npreferred a federally recognised relationship other than marriage, 17.7% selected de facto and 1.3% \nchose no legal status.    \nParticipants were also given the opportunity to select which forms of legal relationship recognition \nthey would like to see remain and/or become available in this country for same-sex couples in \ngeneral.  Responses to this measure (which allowed for multiple selections) show that 77.4% would \nlike to see marriage become available as an option, 59.9% would like to see a federally recognised \nrelationship other than marriage be made available and 48% would like to see de facto recognition \nremain.  These numbers indicate that many participants selected multiple options, suggesting that \nsimply having a choice was an important factor.     \nAlthough the data from this survey indicate that marriage is not for everyone, the majority of  same-\nsex attracted participants in this national survey selected this type of relationship recognition as their \npersonal choice and as a choice to be made available for their fellow same-sex attracted Australians.     \n \n \n  \nNOT SO PRIVATE LIVES     111 \n \nReferences \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics.

    "abstract": "Not So Private Lives is the first national study to examine same-sex attracted Australians’ preferences for various forms of relationship recognition since the introduction of de facto status for same-sex couples at a federal level. It is also the first major study to investigate preferences for relationship recognition while taking into account the current legal status (in Australia or overseas) of an individual’s same-sex relationship.\n\nFindings from the relationship recognition measures of this survey demonstrate that same-sex attracted individuals, like other Australians, differ in the way they prefer their relationships to be formally recognised. However, the results show that the majority of same-sex attracted participants in this survey selected marriage as their personal choice. A federally recognised relationship documented at a registry other than marriage was the second most popular option, and de facto status was the third. The preference for a relationship without any legal status was selected by only 3% of the overall sample.\n\nInterestingly, marriage was still the majority choice irrespective of the current legal status of participants’ same-sex relationships (including no legal status). For example, of those currently in a de facto relationship, 55.4% stated they preferred marriage for themselves, 25.6% stated that they preferred a federally recognised relationship other than marriage, 17.7% selected de facto and 1.3% chose no legal status.\n\nParticipants were also given the opportunity to select which forms of legal relationship recognition they would like to see remain and/or become available in this country for same-sex couples in general. Responses to this measure (which allowed for multiple selections) show that 77.4% would like to see marriage become available as an option, 59.9% would like to see a federally recognised relationship other than marriage be made available and 48% would like to see de facto recognition remain. These numbers indicate that many participants selected multiple options, suggesting that simply having a choice was an important factor.\n\nAlthough the data from this survey indicate that marriage is not for everyone, the majority of same- sex attracted participants in this national survey selected this type of relationship recognition as their personal choice and as a choice to be made available for their fellow same-sex attracted Australians",
