IntroductionThis is the third annual Arcus Social Justice Program  evaluation report, providing updates on specific strategy- related outcomes identified in 2021, perspective on data and information acquired during the year, and an in-depth look at our work supporting Increased Safety, a key goal area in the program’s strategy. The section devoted to increased safety examines our implementation to date, what we’re learning, and how the team is adjusting our approach-based on a reassessment of assumptions articulated when the strategy was designed. The report, which focuses exclusively on work conducted in 2021, also includes a section on the continued impact of the SARS-COVID-19 pandemic—how grantees and the communities they represent pivoted,  adjusted, and even took advantage of new opportunities.As with previous annual evaluation reports, we provide grant data that help us determine whether our financial investments are advancing our strategy, in alignment with our focus on priority themes and geographic regions, and whether we are indeed resourcing LGBTQ communities that are most impacted by structural and systemic inequities1.In 2023, our evaluation process and a resulting report will provide a more detailed assessment of the first five years of implementing the current 10-year strategy. In that report, we will compare outcomes achieved against original baselines, provide a thorough review of our indicators (i.e., measures) along with any recommended changes, and reassess the  appropriateness of our geographic priorities to consider whether we have been able to adequately assist in building and resourcing an effective LGBTQ movement in a given loca-tion. This will be a mid-point “deep dive”, as we refer to the  process, but not a rearticulation of the strategy as a whole.1 The Social Justice Program previously used the term “those most pushed to the margins” to define these priority populations, which typically include those who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), transgender, and migrant/asylum-seeking, among others, depending on the context.SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 20232PAGE The Arcus Social Justice StrategyLGBTQ people, and particularly those most impacted by  systemic and structural inequities, are at risk of discrimi-nation and violence around the world. Arcus has focused on LGBTQ people in specific regions of significant need, and where there is an opportunity for change—not only where threats to the lives of LGBTQ people are acute, but also where the foundation can make a difference based on our knowledge, contacts, and partners on the ground. We place a significant emphasis on LGBTQ people of color, trans communities, refugees, and those living at the intersections of these identities, because of the particular challenges and difficulties they face. These are some of the most marginal-ized communities who are thus under the greatest threat  of violence and discrimination2.Our consultations with leaders in the field, as well as learning from our own work in LGBTQ social justice since the foundation’s inception, led us to focus on three goals: increased safety, increased protections and the curtailing of harmful policy, and increased acceptance and inclusion.  All three together are necessary ingredients for LGBTQ  people to live authentic lives with dignity.Goal Areas and  Cross-Cutting Strategies1. Goals and ObjectivesWithin each of these goal areas, we are focused on specific objectives where we believe Arcus can contribute to change.Increased Safety for LGBTQ PeopleGOAL 1Across all of the geographic regions in which we fund, the safety of LGBTQ people is a critical threshold issue. Without safety, it is difficult, if not impossible, for LGBTQ communi-ties to gain visibility, power, and influence in order to  advocate for protections and inclusion. To increase safety, our Theory of Change posits that (a) gathering and using documentation of hate violence and discrimination, especially when disaggregated by race and gender identity, will enable both advocates and public officials to better understand the extent of the problem, and those most impacted, and underscore the need to address the issue through legal and community-generated means; (b) protecting, empowering, and advocating for those most impacted by a lack of safety, while they are unable to take a proactive role themselves, will enable them to do so since they are in the best position to know what is needed to keep them safe; and (c) supporting community-generated safety initiatives that determine whether  it is in their best interests to work with, against, or separate from criminal justice and legal systems will enable commu-nities to design and implement programs that best respond to their own safety-related needs and local contexts.Increased LGBTQ-Affirming ProtectionsGOAL 2Policy change is a necessary ingredient for promoting safety, acceptance, and the ability of LGBTQ people to thrive. This work involves advocacy for positive protections, such as  nondiscrimination and identity-document changes, as well  as organizing to curtail harmful policy proposals such as  religious exclusions or restrictions on transition-related  healthcare. Our Theory of Change posits that to increase  protections, LGBTQ and allied communities need to engage in (a) base-building and mobilization in order to build the kind of power and influence for their policy goals that can both increase public support and create necessary pressure for public officials to advance positive policy change and stop the enactment of regressive measures; (b) grassroots,  “grasstops,” and media advocacy that enables both experts and members of the base to educate and engage with  policymakers and educate the public through media; and  (c) strategic litigation in both the United States and  increasingly in Global South countries and regions to  promote positive policy and stop harmful measures through establishing legal precedent.Increased Acceptance and Inclusion of LGBTQ PeopleGOAL 3The Social Justice Program is working to increase acceptance and inclusion by focusing on two objectives for which we have seen positive outcomes throughout our decades of work. Our Theory of Change posits that (a) increasing the visibility and influence of affirming faith leaders and faith A2 In the U.S., the Williams Institute found that nearly half of LGBT people of  color live in low-income households, transgender people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to experience violent victimization, and LGBTQI+ migrants are more likely to experience sexual assault in detention from staff and other migrants. Indigenous communities historically and system-atically face violence, forced assimilation, genocide, racism, criminalization of protest, and systemic poverty. An Arcus-funded study by grantee Mexfam in Mexico surveyed 128 Muxe—gender variant people—and revealed discrimi-nation in accessing health services (46%) and violence (41%) as the two main problems that the Muxes confront. The Trans Murder Monitoring Project of Transgender Europe documented 4,042 murders of trans people between 2008 and 2021 around the world (U.S. 324, Mexico 593, Honduras 112, Guatemala  60, El Salvador 58, Guyana 4, Trinidad & Tobago 1, Uganda 2); relative to a country’s total population, the worst situation in the world is in our focus country of Honduras).SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 20233PAGEmessages will help counter the narrative that faith leaders, communities, and theology are per se anti-LGBTQ and  instead present visible, public examples of the ways in which people of faith and faith doctrines are able to  embrace people of all sexualities and gender identities; and (b) improving the accuracy and fairness of media reporting, particularly on issues where public opinion is still fluctu-ating, especially with regard to promoting acceptance of transgender communities, will help provide their audiences with a more authentic picture of LGBTQ lives.2. Cross-cutting StrategiesSUPPORT ECOSYSTEMS OF ORGANIZATIONSIt is rare that one organization by itself brings about impact-ful change. That is why the Social Justice Program funds ecosystems of organizations working on the same or similar issues and employing a range of tactics. Many of these groups are based in U.S. states or in countries that we have prioritized for support. Others are regional or national in scope (in the case of the United States) but are partnering with those working at the community level.SUPPORT THE ENABLERS OF POLICY AND SOCIAL CHANGEWhen taken together, the goal-level objectives described in the preceding section comprise, as a group, enablers of change: documentation, base-building and mobilization,  advocacy, strategic litigation, lifting of pro-LGBTQ faith  voices, fair and accurate reporting, and LGBTQ community- generated initiatives.PROVIDE GRANTEES WITH ADEQUATE FLEXIBILITYThe opportunities and challenges presented to Arcus grantees change and shift regularly. With a new U.S. admin-istration in 2021 have come new possibilities and threats. At the state and country levels, well-funded opponents are engaging in multi-issue culture wars that manifest in new policy proposals on a variety of issues. These threats mean that grantees must be able to pivot from promoting positive change to defeating regressive measures, for example. As a result, their funding must be flexible and sustained. Thus, when possible, the Social Justice Program provides its grantees with multiyear general operating support that takes into account the shifting landscapes grantees are facing while also advancing grantees' core missions and plans,  as well as meeting Arcus goals and indicators.SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 20234PAGEgrantees to gain the capacity to raise funds and pursue other efforts online5.  Even with this assistance, the pandemic  shed a much-needed light on the digital divide, especially  in low-income, rural regions, like the Central Valley of Cal-ifornia (California Rural Legal Assistance), and also high-lighted the value of in-person gatherings, such as trainings, especially when dealing with sensitive subjects like sexuality and gender (Just Detention South Africa).Documentation and AdvocacyIn the second year of the pandemic, several Arcus grantees documented its impact on LGBTQ communities, provided evidence that humanitarian assistance from government agencies was not effectively reaching these communities, and disseminated these findings widely. These efforts  included the following:n “Where are the Global COVID-19 Resources for LGBTI Communities?” (Global Philanthropy Project)6, in which GPP documented that only one in over 4,000 researched providers of humanitarian assistance named LGBTQ  people specifically among potential recipients.n Impact reports on the human rights situation of trans  people in Guatemala during COVID-19 (HIVOS/OTRANS), on the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on access to justice for LGBTQ persons and sex workers in two districts in Uganda (HRAPF), and on the impact of the pandemic on LGBTIQ+ people in East and Southern Africa as well  as on LBQ women in Southern Africa Development  Community (SADC) countries (Pan Africa ILGA).n The Independent Expert on SOGI presented his Annual Report to the UN Third Committee on the disproportionate  impact of the pandemic on LGBTQ persons and reiterated measures to ensure pandemic responses are free from  Assist, Pivot, Zoom and Repeat:  Another Year of Pandemic Impact  and AdjustmentsIn last year’s evaluation report, we discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our grantee organizations and the communities in which they work. In 2021, the pandemic continued to exacerbate already high levels of violence, discrimination, and poverty3.ImpactIn Honduras, government quarantine and curfew measures restricted many trans women to homes where they experi-enced violence. In addition, those engaging in sex work,  who were forbidden from being outdoors at night, saw their already precarious economic circumstances become even more dire (Centro de Derechos de Mujeres – MDR). LGBTQ Kenyans, also subjected to lockdown measures, were subjected to familial rejection, forced evictions, arbitrary dismissal by employers, targeted police extortions, black-mail, and other forms of extortion (National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission —NGLHRC). Increased incidents of violence led to a greater need for legal assistance resulting in grantee staff burnout. Access to the judicial system in Uganda to seek redress was greatly curtailed during lockdowns, which meant longer periods of detention for LGBTQ defendants (Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum – HRAPF). One U.S. grantee reported that its advocacy efforts were successful in keeping courts open to process name changes (Transgender Legal  Defense & Education Fund – TLDEF). Among other cancella-tions were parliamentary sessions, which delayed the  introduction and enactment of non-discrimination legislation  in Honduras (Parliamentarians for Global Action).For U.S. grantees working on LGBTQ refugee and migration justice, the government’s use of a public health measure, Title 42, effectively closed the border to asylum seekers, an action taken by the Trump administration and maintained by the Biden administration4 (Santa Fe Dreamers).Lockdowns and the need for social distancing necessitated  the move of most grantee activities from in-person to  online. Arcus’ Social Justice Technical Assistance Initiative  (TAI) provided training, coaching, and funds to enable our II. In-Depth AssessmentsA3 When the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund (TLDEF) analyzed client median incomes in the United States directly before the pandemic  and during its first full year, they found that poverty levels increased from  62% to 69%.4 Biden’s later efforts to discontinue the use of Title 42 met with opposition by some border states. In May 2022, a federal judge in Louisiana issued a temporary injunction stopping the administration from rescinding Title 42.5 An evaluation of the TAI’s work will be conducted later in 2022.6 This effort led to a larger research project (not yet published), with support from Astraea and USAID, to articulate how humanitarian assistance needs to be inclusive of LGBT people.SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 20235PAGELemonade from Lemons:  Pivoting to New Solutions  and OpportunitiesThe disruptive nature of the pandemic, as difficult as it has been, often provided the opportunity as well as the necessity for grantees to try new strategies and launch new initiatives that might not have been conceived of in pre-pandemic times. Grantees reported that the changes they experienced and ultimately made often resulted in unanticipated oppor-tunities and new approaches to advancing their missions.Reaching New and Expanded Advocates,  Supporters and Audiencesn In its state’s 2021 legislative session, the Equality Arizona Foundation took advantage of online public comment (instituted as a public health measure) to mobilize over 300 activists to attend committee hearings virtually to advocate against dozens of anti-LGBTQ bills. This oppor-tunity allowed the organization to create a new LGBTQ leadership table in Arizona comprised of over 30 LGBTQ and allied organizations to coordinate strategy and  messaging. The online format allowed the Equality  Arizona Foundation to develop new digital outreach  strategies to reach previously un-engaged LGBTQ  communities across the state.n The need to move fundraising activities online resulted in Equality Florida Institute retaining a digital strategist and a direct mail firm focused on raising funds from small- dollar and monthly donors. These efforts opened up a new funding horizon for the organization, which saw digital fundraising increase by 400 percent.n The move to online programming enabled grantees to reach new, key audiences (150 mainstream service providers [NYC Anti-Violence Project (AVP)]; Community Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) model for students in schools without a GSA [Genders & Sexualities Alliance Network]; rural and small-town residents throughout Georgia [Equality Foundation of Georgia]; Gender Affirming Health Care Training participants from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Lesotho, eSwatini, Uganda, and Kenya, as well as from Honduras, Chile, Spain, Pakistan, and Indonesia [Gender Dynamix]).Re-thinking data-gathering strategiesn The closure of local anti-violence programs, long the violence and discrimination based on SOGI (UN Founda-tion funded for support of the Independent Expert).n After hosting an online safe space to understand how the pandemic is impacting trans and gender diverse people  in Southern Africa, an evidence-based Recommendatory  Report was commissioned, focused on access to healthcare  and the feasibility of telemedicine for trans and gender diverse persons (Gender DynamiX).n In Botswana, Arcus grantee LEGABIBO, the country’s  largest LGBTQ organization, joined the National Civil Society Organization (CSO) COVID-19 Technical Working Group to monitor the government's response to COVID  and ensure inclusion of vulnerable groups.n In the U.S., a bilingual “Know Your Rights” guide was published for trans people grappling with issues related to accessing public benefits and healthcare, and how to  respond to incidents of discrimination during the  pandemic (TLDEF).Continued Mutual Aid and  Distribution of Financial ResourcesServing as a convener of mutual aid makes us a better  partner to others working on issues that intersect with the identities of the broader LGBTQ community like immigra-tion, reproductive justice, bail reform, decriminalization, and economic justice. –Equality North Carolina FoundationGiven the significant impact of the pandemic on LGBTQ  communities, especially those prioritized in our strategy, as well as the failure of government and NGOs to include LGBTQ persons in their assistance plans, grantee organi-zations continued to provide life-saving services to their communities, often diverting staff and other resources from organizing, advocacy, and other mission-related activities. Notable examples included:n Street distribution of safety and hygiene kits as well as  educational materials (Triangle Project, Urgent Action Fund subgrantees).n Distribution of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), rides to/from the polls, and pharmacy runs and grocery deliver-ies (Equality North Carolina Foundation, Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya, Jinsiangu).n Creation, fundraising for, and distribution of special COVID-19 funds to help community members pay for basic necessities (Familia raised $20,000, Campaign for Southern  Equality raised $475,000, The Astraea Foundation raised more than $1 million7).n Distribution of PPE and hygiene kits in places of detention (COMCAVIS TRANS).7 Like many funders, Astraea also allowed existing grantees to repurpose  their funding for pandemic relief and reduced application and reporting  requirements.SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 20236PAGEwillingness and ability of officials to address violence. n Increased coordination of activists (including faith  leaders) will improve efforts to address violence. n Advocates will need to work to convince authorities to use the documentation and overcome resistance.Thus, the original focus of this goal area was on decreasing incidents of hate violence through documentation, reporting,  organizing, and advocacy. By and large, the indicators  (i.e., measures) identified reflected the accuracy of this  focus, with one exception—a “catch all” indicator to track  community-generated safety initiatives. This latter category was identified to ensure we were tracking grantees’ efforts  to advance safety that did not involve engagement with either legal enforcement or public officials.As the strategy was implemented through grantmaking, it soon became clear in the U.S. portfolio that most of the work of our grantees was not focused on data gathering and reporting or on advocating with officials. Instead, grantees were working in their communities on safety initiatives that were more preventive in nature.8In contrast, many grantees in the international portfolio were gathering and reporting data and advocating with  officials to address the high incidence of hate violence,  while others were engaged in more community-focused prevention efforts.The difference in these approaches is based in part on the fact that the U.S. does not consider itself accountable to glob-al human rights bodies in the same way that other countries do. Thus, when advocates in African or Central American countries collect and disseminate data, they are able to use it to put pressure on their governments through mechanisms such as the Universal Periodic Review or through litigation at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Such options are  not viable for U.S.-based organizations where courts regularly  ignore rulings of their counterparts abroad.Thus, while grantees across all regions are pursuing safety in some similar ways (e.g., through petitions for name and gender marker changes; through assisting migrants, asylum- seekers, and those in detention; and through a variety of services), the collection and use of hate violence and other forms of data are not as relevant and useful a strategy in  the U.S. as they are in the Global South. Moreover, Global South grantees appear to be more engaged in using their  resources to train judges, police, prison officials, and others source of data on hate violence incidents, resulted in the NYC AVP deciding to begin working on a new national survey model that will focus on incidents of hate violence and the impact they have on the community. Although AVP had previously concluded that it needed to improve its data gathering process, the pandemic raised this need to a higher priority than it had been.Reimagining grantmaking processesn In 2021, the Fund for Trans Generations (FTG) at Borealis Philanthropy experimented with video format proposals for potential grantees to alleviate the burdens of traditional  grantmaking processes that were further intensified by the pandemic. FTG received over 40 video submissions from community-based, trans-led organizations. As a  result of this effort, the Fund’s advisory committee reported  that they were able to have a clearer sense of the work and context of the groups submitting proposals, which aided the rigor of their decision-making, and grantees felt appreciative of the non-written option. FTG’s experience with alternate proposal formats is an example from which other foundations may learn.Reexamining Safety:  Findings and AdjustmentsA life free of violence and oppression enables LGBTQ people to more easily access employment, education, housing, healthcare, and other necessities. It also enables communities  to be organized and mobilized to engage in advocacy with public officials, with the media, with their faith communities,  and with the public generally. The roots of violence and a lack of safety are similar across all of Arcus’ priority regions in the U.S. and the Global South—social stigma, religious intolerance, gender-based oppression, state-sanctioned oppression, and police violence.As stated above, the goal of increased safety has three main objectives: (1) Gathering and using documentation of hate violence and discrimination. (2) Protecting, empowering, and advocating for those impacted by a lack of safety.  (3) Supporting community-generated safety initiatives.When the Social Justice strategy was developed, our  approach to the goal of increased safety was developed in accordance with the following underlying assumptions:n The collection and use of documentation will improve evidence-based advocacy and litigation as well as the  B8 The housing initiatives being pursued by The Outlaw Project in Arizona are a good example of this.SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 20237PAGEprosecutor’s office for developing a protocol on investigating crimes against LGBT people based on hatred. Other examples  include LEGABIBO in Botswana and NGLHRC, galck+, and NYARWEK in Kenya.Documentation that we have supported has become a reference in the conceptual understanding of the human rights of LGBTQ people.Two reports were presented to the United Nations by the UN Independent Expert on SOGI (whose work was previously supported by Arcus through a grant to the UN Foundation and now through a grant to Harvard College) on “Law of Inclusion” and “Practices of Exclusion,” on the international legal recognition of gender and gender identity and expres-sion, in connection, respectively, with the struggle against violence and discrimination, and the backlash against the incorporation of gender frameworks in international human rights law. Also, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) published “State-Sponsored Homophobia,” the “Trans Legal Report,” and a report on so-called “conversion therapy,” each with a training webinar on how activists can use these reports  at the national, regional, and international levels. GPP’s “Manufacturing Moral Panic: Weaponizing Children to Undermine Gender Justice and Human Rights,” published jointly with Elevate Children Funders Group, highlights such strategies employed by gender restrictive groups, undermin-ing democracy and strengthening illiberal politics. Several grantees’ hate crimes documentation is quoted in U.S. State Department human rights reports, expanding the audience of  our grantees’ data and confirming that their documentation is a reliable reference on these issues. Among those quoted are COMCAVIS TRANS (El Salvador), Cattrachas (Honduras, supported via Centro de Derechos de Mujeres [CDM]), and Lambda (Guatemala, supported via Letra S, Mexico). Peer-level regional networks in Central America and Mexico are producing more documentation than  in other regions.The network Sin Violencia (Without Violence) documents hate crimes in a variety of countries. In Mexico, for instance, network member Letra S documented 117 murders of LGBTQ people in 2019-20, of whom 64 were trans women. Corpora en Libertad (Bodies in Freedom) network documented the situa-tion of LGBTQ people in detention in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, with the first-ever published survey of LGBTQ people in detention. Corpora contributed its views to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which will issue an advisory opinion on the subject.to improve their treatment of LGBTQ people. While a few Arcus grantees in the United States engage in such training, more organizations are advocating for approaches to safety that are non-carceral and do not involve the police.The following sections further explain the somewhat  disparate approaches of the two portfolios, detailing findings related to the work of grantees in the Global South and recounting the staff-led research project on rethinking our approach to safety in the U.S.Increased Safety in Global South Regions: Implementation FindingsAnti-LGBTQ discrimination and violence occur in a larger context of abuses of the general population in most of our focus countries, perpetrated by both law enforcement and private actors, often with impunity. In most countries, there are serious concerns about the rule of law, from the lack of impartiality of magistrates in El Salvador and Guatemala in cases regarding corruption/integrity of high public officials to the use of military courts in Uganda.Gathering and Using DocumentationGrantees are using documentation to identify and  analyze violence and discrimination and present the  information before national authorities (e.g., prosecutors,  human rights and other offices, and courts), regional bodies (e.g., the African and the Inter-American  Commissions on Human Rights), and UN human rights bodies to highlight the responsibility that governments have to protect the human rights of LGBTQ people. This work relies on the principle of accountability of  governments toward all people and on the shaming of  governments at the regional and UN levels for not complying with commitments made in those fora. For instance,  Honduras received 16 recommendations from other states  in the United Nations’ Universal Periodic Review, and our grantee Cattrachas, a lesbian group, highlighted in that context their documentation of a number of deaths of LGBT people three times larger than that acknowledged by the  government, showing therefore that the government needs to improve its data collection in order to be able to implement  proper remedies. TEA Kenya successfully used its survey of trans people and individual stories in their petition before courts. Cattrachas successfully introduced its data in support of the Vicky Hernandez v. Honduras petition in the Inter- American Court of Human Rights. Letra S in Mexico used its annual hate crimes reports to obtain cooperation with a high SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 20238PAGEFondo Semillas in Mexico, Astraea in the Caribbean, and  Fundación Fondo Centroamericano de Mujeres (FCAM) in Central America. A direct grant to Las Reinas Chulas in Mexico supported a first-ever conference of Mexican bisexual women, plus a survey of individuals. Other women-led and women–focused efforts we supported include Balance in Mexico, The Initiative for Equality and Non-Discrimination (INEND) in Kenya, and Triangle Project in South Africa.Indigenous LBT people: Funding supported Muxe Indig-enous trans women’s empowerment, documentation, and advocacy in Mexico (Mexfam); and legal assistance in Guate-mala (Colectivo Amigos Contra El Sida [CAS]).Intersex people: Astraea’s Intersex Human Rights Fund  is the main vehicle for our support to intersex groups. In  addition, small grants are awarded from Arcus funds by Fondo Semillas in Mexico and UHAI in Uganda. Some of the groups we support directly, such as Jinsiangu in Kenya and Iranti, focus their work on both trans and intersex people. We recognized intersex people as a group impacted by struc-tural and systemic inequities and in need of resources. Given the size of intersex organizations, their absorption capacity in our regions is limited. Community-Generated Safety InitiativesGrantees’ service delivery programs not only  enhance safety for their communities but provide data that is used to advance policy through advocacy.  Services include:Legal assistance to individuals: HRAPF in Uganda assisted in the case of 44 individuals arrested by police following a raid of the Happy Family Youth Uganda LGBTQI+ shelter  outside Kampala (May 2021). This case was similar to one the  previous year in which 20 LGBTQ people were arrested at the  Children of the Sun Foundation’s shelter for homeless LGBTQ youth in Uganda. In both cases, police claimed a breach of COVID-related protocols. In Kenya, grantee NGLHRC provided legal advice about security situations and family relations. Amicus DH in Mexico and TEA in Kenya provided support to trans and gender nonbinary individuals to change their identity documents based on self-determination.  Amicus DH obtained the first court judgment in Mexico  recognizing a nonbinary individual and drafted guides  specific to Mexican states to guide individuals in following the procedures for legal gender recognition without assis-tance from a lawyer. CAS in Guatemala provided support to LGBTQ groups seeking legal registration. Triangle Project provided legal assistance to survivors of hate violence, such as assault and rape.Grantees have used innovative and reliable methods to document violence and to ascertain community needs.Iranti, working regionally in Africa, has created and launched a mobile app so LGBTQ+ people can document cases and violations when they do not want to report to law enforcement. Through the creation and implementation of Action Groups, Iranti has trained community organiza-tions, LGBTIQ+ persons, and stakeholders to monitor hate crimes and violations in South Africa through the Margins to Mainstream app. The Action Groups track hate crimes that are published in mainstream media as well as those that community members inform them about.Although statistically not necessarily representative, results from surveys administered by grantees can become powerful tools in the hands of advocates because they rely on individ-ual stories and statistics, such as Muxe-conducted surveys in Oaxaca (Mexfam). Las Reinas Chulas surveyed bisexual women in Mexico; Movimiento de Diversidad en Resistencia (MDR) surveyed LGBTQ people in Honduras; and TEA  surveyed trans people in Kenya. Grantees used these surveys to inform their own strategies and priorities.Protecting, Empowering and Advocating for Those Most Impacted by InequitiesFor LGBTQ populations that are significantly more  vulnerable to violence, discrimination, and lack of access  to basic necessities, Arcus’ funding focused on safety  prioritizes the following:Trans communities: Direct funding is provided to  organizations able to absorb a grant of at least $50,000. Smaller groups are funded through intermediaries, such as the International Trans Fund, HIVOS in Central America,  and Fondo Semillas in Mexico.Migrants and refugees: In Mexico, a network of LGBTQ groups along migration routes provide support and referrals to services to LGBTQ migrants and refugees, and advocate with authorities to protect their rights (Fundación Arcoíris). Centro para el Desarrollo y la Cooperación LGBTI (SOMOS CDC) supported displaced LGBTQ human rights defenders from Honduras, advised on safe routes and procedures to Costa Rica, and organized advocacy with governments. In Kenya, regional grantmaker UHAI-the East Africa Sexual Health and Rights Initiative awarded Arcus funds to support the work of small groups led by refugees.  Lesbian, Bisexual, and Queer Women: Arcus provided funding to LBT women’s groups through intermediaries  SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 20239PAGEReevaluating Our Approach to Safety in the United StatesQuestioning Our Reliance on  Data Gathering and ReportingIn 2021, we saw an unprecedented level of attacks on  LGBTQ people in the United States, as evidenced in part  by the historic number of harmful bills introduced in state  legislatures and continued murders of transgender people, especially trans women of color. In addition, as noted above, the unrelenting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic kept  LGBTQ organizations focused on direct services and mutual aid in order to ensure that their communities could stay  safe and healthy.At Arcus, our Social Justice Program strategy recognizes how central safety is to the lived experience of LGBTQ people who exist at the intersections of multiple identities. When the strategy was originally conceived, one of its core, underlying assumptions was that the collection, disaggregation, and dissemination of hate crime incidence data would raise the visibility of the issue, both to the public and to the authorities,  in order to provide solid evidence of how hate violence was impacting communities experiencing the highest levels of violence. In addition, we assumed that once accurate, disaggregated data was provided to authorities, they would become more responsive to investigating these incidents  and prosecuting those responsible.During the first years of the strategy’s implementation,  staff undertook research in order to better understand the current status of hate violence incident data collection, both  by public authorities and by community sources. We soon learned how significantly flawed both processes were. In the government realm, while the U.S. Hate Crimes Act includes  a provision on data collection by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the local data sources (county officials and other criminal justice agencies) were under no legal obligation to supply this data.  It was essentially a voluntary act. Thus, the data received by the FBI was at best spotty, insufficiently covering the entire United States, especially in Arcus priority states, and when furnished, may or may not have included incidents of anti-LGBTQ violence.On the community side, we learned that many sources, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, use media reports as their source of hate incident data, which means that only the most highly visible acts of violence are included. Within the LGBTQ community, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence  Projects, an Arcus grantee that is housed at the New York City Anti-Violence Project, has for many years published Psychological assistance: Individual and group sessions are sometimes offered complementary to legal assistance (e.g., NGLHRC in Kenya). Groups such as MDR in Honduras surveyed community members about psycho-social issues they face.Many groups provide referrals to services by other organi-zations, particularly in the case of LGBTQ migrants and refugees. For instance, CAISO in Trinidad & Tobago and Fundacion Arcoiris, the Mexican Network to support LGBTQ migrants and refugees, provided referrals to other groups, such as organizations running shelters.Training of public officials: Grantees engaged in training  judges, prosecutors, police, and other law enforcement officials mainly highlight basic human rights issues, types of abuses from authorities, and remedies. Some facilitate dialogues with openly LGBTQ persons, highlighting their humanity and the responsibility of public officials. These groups include NGLHRC, INEND, and TEA in Kenya, and  Mexfam in Mexico, which went as far as documenting human  rights protection obligations derived from international, regional, and national law, and discussing them with public  officials. The Network of African National Human Rights Institutions (NANHRI) trained staff of National Human Rights Institutions (government-funded bodies monitoring human rights) in African countries, including Kenya, Uganda,  Malawi, and South Africa. Evaluation of such efforts is usually  at the level of outputs, only measuring public officials’  satisfaction with the learning sessions. However, relation-ships are formed in these dialogues, and the impact is likely to be long term and not as a result of one training, but through a variety of learning opportunities. INEND in Kenya, and more recently also in Uganda, reached out to boda-boda (moto) drivers, who sometimes are perpetrators of abuses against LGBTQ people, with dialogues and relationship building, turning some of them into supporters, and therefore  helping reduce such abuses. Faith groups MANERELA+ and ZANERELA+ train community members and police who have, as a result, intervened in cases to reduce violence and to assist survivors who wish to file a report.It is important to point out that, while training of police and other criminal justice officials can provide some short-term relief, it is not seen as a long-term solution. In many African countries, these systems are an outgrowth of colonialism unable to be systemically changed through trainings. SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 202310PAGEend in arrest and detention for non-criminal behaviors. To advance community safety solutions, SNaPCo successfully advocated for the establishment of a pre-arrest diversion  program, the reclassification of marijuana as a non- arrestable offence, and an ordinance that eliminated cash bail for non-violent offenses, among other victories. Grantees of the Contigo Fund in Central Florida secured pledges from officials that they would support the elimination  of ordinances related to sex work, which disproportionately target trans women, especially trans women of color.  To advance safety for LGBTQ people, we must keep LGBTQ people out of detention. We found that LGBTQ communities are not safe when incarcerated and detained within the criminal justice and immigration systems, as they are disproportionately subjected to harassment, abuse, and neglect by authorities and others.The Santa Fe Dreamers Project (SFDP), based in New Mexico, facilitated the release of 140 transgender women who were detained in the Cibola Detention Center. SFDP also supported  detained transgender women who were relocated to other states by mobilizing a network of movement partners across the country to support them. SFDP's goal is that every trans-gender woman imprisoned in the United States is released from custody and placed into a safe community.Black Youth Project 100 (BYP100) Education Fund, in  coalition with other organizations in Durham, North Carolina,  successfully established the Department of Community  Safety and Wellness. This new department will be equipped to  provide non-carceral care to communities in crisis, ultimately  keeping individuals out of detention. To advance safety for LGBTQ people, we must expand access to services that support those most impacted by inequities. We found that LGBTQ communities overwhelm-ingly understand that increasing access to services, such as housing, education, and healthcare, is required for safety. In addition to being actively criminalized, LGBTQ communities  disproportionately lack access to services to thrive and heal from the trauma of being targeted. Lack of access to services also leaves LGBTQ people vulnerable to increased crimi-nalization and incarceration. Additionally, we found that because LGBTQ people living at the intersection of multiple identities are disproportionately criminalized and incarcer-ated, they are more likely to have criminal records, which makes it extremely difficult to access housing, employment, and educational services.an annual report on hate violence incidents. While this community organization is perhaps the most trusted of all sources, we learned that the data collected comes primarily from the Coalition’s local AVP members, scattered across the United States and not covering the entire country. Moreover, the limited resources of these local organizations and their priority focus on providing services to survivors of violence rather than on collecting data, means that the Coalition’s data, while more trustworthy than that provided to the FBI, was still inadequate. In the final analysis, we needed to acknowledge that,  even if data gathering was comprehensive and expertly  disaggregated, the reporting of data to criminal justice  authorities in order to gain their cooperation in arresting  and prosecuting perpetrators meant that we would be encouraging collaboration with the very institutions that are often the source of harm to the communities we fund. Thus, we realized that reliance on data reporting to advance  safety could ultimately prove counterproductive. Based on this understanding, it became clear to Arcus pro-gram staff that our initial assumptions regarding the value of data collection might not be the best way to support efforts by LGBTQ organizations to increase safety in their commu-nities. As a result, the Social Justice U.S. team undertook a new investigation, led by Program Officer Glo Ross, to obtain insights into how our grantee partners and their allies define safety and how the foundation might re-think our support in this area. We spent part of 2021 talking with grantees and others in the field, as well as reviewing an extensive body of literature and reports on the topic. Our key findings are outlined below, along with examples of how these findings are aligned with the work of current Arcus grantees.Findings from the ReassessmentTo advance safety for LGBTQ people, we must advocate for the elimination of laws that harm those most impacted by  inequities. We found that members of the LGBTQ communities we prioritize overwhelmingly define safety by first acknowl-edging that systems of oppression perpetuate violence by criminalizing non-normative sexual orientation, gender, ability, and race, as well as poverty and citizenship status, among other identities and experiences. The Solutions Not Punishment Collaborative (SNaPCo)  conducted two surveys in Atlanta, Georgia, and found that transgender and queer people are often stopped by police  as “suspicious” because of their gender identity, sexual orientation, or race, leading to interactions with police that SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 202311PAGEThe Outlaw Project, based in Arizona, learned that housing insecurity was the major barrier to a critical aspect of safety for their community, as well as to the group’s achieving its short- and long-term leadership and advocacy goals. As a result, they launched a tiny homes housing project in 2021  to address the root cause of incarceration and violence  experienced by their community. The project has supported at least 15 transgender women thus far.  California Rural Legal Assistance, working in the Central  Valley of California, supported 10 transgender and gender- nonconforming individuals with name and gender marker correction cases. Accurate identification is key to ensuring these individuals can access needed services. The Transgender Legal and Education Fund (TLDEF) also provides these  services to clients in other Arcus priority states.Fortunately, when we took a close look at the work we are supporting (coded in our system as “community-generated safety initiatives”) we found that most of the safety-related  work of U.S. grantees already aligned with the above findings.  Essentially, many grantees were already engaged in work to advance the decriminalization and decarceration of LGBTQ people and expand their access to key services, often in  tandem with advocacy and power-building strategies. It is important to state here that Arcus is not a funder of  direct services per se, a decision of long standing by our board and senior management. Service delivery is supported in the Social Justice Program only when it is part of a grantee’s  larger strategy aimed at building a base of supporters and  a grassroots advocacy initiative. Providing grantees with general operating support grants enables them to more  easily engage in this combination of tactics with the dual goals of advancing safety and policy protections.Based on these findings, in next year’s “Deep Dive” monitor-ing and evaluation report, the U.S. Social Justice team plans to further review indicators measuring increased safety and make recommendations for how best to align the program’s Theory of Change with what we have learned from the field and what we are actually funding. This will be part of a larger effort to review all indicators originally put in place when the strategy was approved. In the meantime, any new U.S. Social Justice grantees considered for a grant to advance safety for LGBTQ people will be evaluated against the  framework and findings outlined above.SOCIAL JUSTICE PROGRAM | EVALUATION REPORT: 2021 | JANUARY 202312PAGE Goal: Increased SafetyDocumenting and Addressing Violence and DiscriminationArcus provided support to grantees who published and disseminated the following reports:III.

The data will show the  contrast between 2018 grantmaking (i.e., which included grants made under the former strategy as well as grants awarded under the current strategy) and an  average of the first three years of the current strategy, (i.e., 2019, 2020, 2021).Both types of funding increased over this period. In 2018, 23% of grant dollars were awarded as multiyear funding ($3.5m). The average of 2019-2021 saw an increase to 66% ($9.3m) of grant funding. Similarly, general operating support  grants in 2018 were 32% ($4.9m) of funds awarded with an increase to an  average of 36% over the next three years ($5m). This data is evidence of a  commitment by the Social Justice Program to increase both types of funding to the extent that is both appropriate and in accordance with United States Internal Revenue Service regulations. 19PAGEFaith Funding 2018-2021Trans Funding 2018-2021In both the United States and International portfolios, faith funding decreased during the first three years of the current strategy–from 30% in 2018 ($4.5m) to an average of 12% over the next three years ($1.7m). Some of this change can be attributed to a) the lack of faith organizing in the new region of Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and b) the need to clarify U.S. faith funding in Arcus’  priority states. Currently, the International portfolio has a higher amount of faith funding (14% v 10% [$929k v $742k] in the U.S. over the three-year period). It is anticipated that the U.S. amount will increase in 2022 now that a scoping project has been completed and new, potential faith grantees have been identified.Trans funding increased overall in the current strategy from 19% ($2.9m)  in 2018 to an average of 32% ($4.5m) over the following three-year period.  The dotted trend lines show the upward trajectory, smoothing out year-to-year peaks and valleys that are the result of multiyear grant funding. While  international trans funding increased over 2018, its three-year average of  27% [$1.8m] is lower than that of the U.S. (38%) [$2.7m].

This increase was smaller for the International portfolio (36% to 42% [$2.5m to $2.9m]) than it was for the U.S. (21% to 38% [$1.8m to $2.7m).  The higher increase in the U.S. is likely the result of the advent of new pooled fund investments such as the Fund for Trans Generations and the Black Trans Fund. Nevertheless, it is important to keep an eye on the overall figure in order to ensure that most of Arcus’ funds are awarded directly to grantee organizations. Direct funding enables staff to nurture and develop trusting relationships with grantees.The International portfolio team has made a concerted effort to ensure that most of our funding is directed to organizations based in the Global South, including intermediaries and pooled funds. That effort is evident in the data, which shows an increase in funding to the Global South from 40% ($2.8m) in 2018 to 74% ($5.1m) over the three-year average.

In the International portfolio, funding to global organizations decreased from 38% ($2.6m) in 2018 to 12% ($819k) in the three-year average, while funding regionally and in specific countries increased from 50% ($3.2m) to 57% ($4m) and from 12% ($840k) to 30% ($2m), respectively. In the U.S., the shift is similar, from 53% ($4.4m) to national groups in 2018 to 42% ($3m) over the three-year period.

    "abstract": "Arcus Social Justice Program's 2021 evaluation report provides updates on implementing strategies for grantmaking to movements and organizations working toward LGBTQ rights in East and Southern Africa, the Caribbean, Central America, and the southern United States. By analyzing data and information acquired throughout 2021, this report details advancements toward each of the program's overarching goal areas, with a particular focus on work supporting increased safety for LGBTQ people across the Global South and the southern United States. The report also breaks down the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.As in previous annual evaluations, the data and information included in the report come from grant reports submitted by our grantees; our ongoing engagement with grantees, colleague funders, and others with relevant experience in our geographic regions; research reports; and media sources. In addition, Arcus analyzes its own grantmaking data to ensure that funding reflects the foundation's priorities and values",
