The analysis of the Index follows the four pillars, on which the rating \nsystem of the CEI is based: non-discrimination policies, equal benefits for the LGBTQ+ \nemployees, organizational LGBTQ+ competency and public commitment. The \nevolution of the criteria during the years, the methodology, the rating system and the \nrecent criteria of the CEI are presented, delving deeper into the analysis of its findings. \nThese findings offer a list of “best practices”, which could be used from organizations \nto foster LGBTQ+ inclusion in their workplaces, gaining a major advantage, towards \ntheir competitors. In order to highlight the benefits of implementing LGBTQ+ inclusive \npractices and policies in the workplace, a top-rated company in the CEI, for consecutive \nyears since its launch, is presented. Concluding, the CEI could be used as a self-\nassessment tool for employers interested in fostering LGBTQ+ equality and inclusion. It \ncould be a useful tool, providing LGBTQ+ inclusive “best practices”. However, \ndiversity and inclusion (D&I) issues in the workplace, should be conceptually \nexpanding, because D&I are practically company-wide issues. It is also pointed out, that \nthe CEI or other similar indexes are not a panacea for LGBTQ+ equality. The “voices” \nof the employees, working on awarded LGBTQ+ inclusive employers do matter and \nthey should be taken seriously into account. \nKeywords: Corporate Equality Index, CEI, LGBTQ+, diversity, inclusion, equality in \nthe workplace, gay rights \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \niv \n \nContents \nIntroduction ................................................................................................................................. 1 \nLiterature Review ........................................................................................................................ 4 \nHuman Rights Campaign .......................................................................................................... 4 \nCorporate Equality Index 2018 ................................................................................................. 4 \nStonewall Workplace Equality Index ........................................................................................ 6 \nThe evolution of the CEI criteria ............................................................................................... 9 \nWhat Businesses are rated ....................................................................................................... 11 \nHow the survey data is collected ............................................................................................. 11 \nOfficial and unofficial ratings ................................................................................................. 12 \nHow ratings are used ............................................................................................................... 12 \nCEI criteria 2018 ..................................................................................................................... 13 \nFindings ...................................................................................................................................... 16 \nNon-discrimination policies .................................................................................................... 17 \nEqual Benefits ......................................................................................................................... 18 \nOrganizational LGBTQ competency ...................................................................................... 18 \nPublic Commitment ................................................................................................................ 22 \nA best employer to work for LGBTQ equality ....................................................................... 23 \nCoca-Cola’s LGBT Diversity and Inclusion ........................................................................... 25 \nPolicies and Benefits of The Coca-Cola Co. ........................................................................... 28 \nConclusions ................................................................................................................................ 29 \nBibliography .............................................................................................................................. 32 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nv \n \nList of tables \nTable                                                                                                                       Page \n1.

Saying “equal”, a focus on \ndiversity and inclusion (D&I) in the workplace is implied, because both D&I practices \nset the basis for an inclusive work environment, for every single employee. \nBegging with diversity, it has to do with visible & invisible characteristics (Moore, \n1999; Morley, Moore, Heraty, Linehan, & MacCurtain, 2004), e.g. skin color is a \nvisible characteristic of diversity; is subjective (Bechtoldt, De Dreu, & Nijstad, 2007), \n(people characterize others as similar or dissimilar), selective (some characteristics are \nstronger indicators of diversity in comparison to others), context dependant (individuals \ncan characterized as different, only comparing to others) and relative (ambiguous) \n(Moore, 1999). Diversity is concerning the similarities and differences in such \ncharacteristics as age, gender, ethnic heritage, physical abilities and disabilities, race \nand sexual orientation among employees in the organizations (Griffin & Moorhead, \n2006). Adding something to this definition, “gender identity” is another strong aspect of \ndiversity, which should not be ignored. \nInclusion concerns how well organizations and their members fully connect with, \nengage and utilize people across all types of differences (Ferdman, 2013; O’Donovan, \n2017). Individuals wish to be allowed to be themselves (O’Donovan, 2018) in every \naspect or sector of their life, including the professional one. That’s why a diverse and \ninclusive workplace for every single employee does matter, in order for them to unleash \ntheir full potential. Due to Gasorek (2000), inclusion concerns the degree to which: \nemployees and their ideas are valued, build successful partnerships in and across other \ndepartments, feel they fully belong to or attracted by the organization (candidates / \nfuture employees), feel committed to each other and to organization’s goals, are \nemployed in a flexible and diverse workplace. \nBut why do organizations focus nowadays, so much on D&I or why D&I appear to be \nincreasing in organizations? The benefits D&I have to offer to the workplace give the \nanswer to this question. Cost savings (reducing turnover and absenteeism), winning the \nwar talent (diverse and inclusive workplace attract talents), improvement of innovation \nand creativity, increased flexibility, more effective leadership, business growth (e.g. \nmarket expansion), increased employee commitment, confidence, morale and job \n2 \n \nsatisfaction are among the most important advantages D&Ι can offer to organizations \n(O’Donovan, 2017). \nHowever, D&I are not a panacea for the businesses. While implementing D&I policies \nand practices organizations must beware of some challenges: increased costs (diversity \nprograms aim to change the corporate culture take longer or sometimes fail), lack of \nsenior management support (something totally necessary for the successful \nimplementation of D&I practices and any other practice related to changes in the  \norganizational culture), change and complexity, tension, group agendas (some groups \nbelieve that diversity is important only for their group not for the organization as a \nwhole), reverse discrimination, tokenism (in order to fulfil quota numbers, less qualified \nemployees are hired) (O’Donovan, 2017). \nThis paper focuses on D&I in organizations, regarding the LGBTQ employees. For \nmore than 30 years now, the literature examines LGBT issues in the workplace, but the \nstudy of LGBT sexualities and genders is not very extensive (Eddy & Rumens, 2017). \nThe research for LGBT workplace issues appears to be low compared to other \nmarginalized groups (Ragins, 2004). Maher et al. (2009) defined three different phases, \nrelated to literature on LGBT issues in the workplace: early work (1800s-1972) with a \nfocus on homosexuality as a disease; 2nd phase (1972-1990) pointing out negative \nattitudes towards homosexuality (e.g., homophobia, violence and discrimination against \nLGBTs); 3rd phase (post-1990) related to changing institutions to foster a positive \nworkplace atmosphere. The recent trend is to examine how organizations could create \nwork environments, that are LGBTQ inclusive (Everly & Schwarz, 2015; Köllen, \n2013), turning the emphasis form anti-discrimination to the LGBTQ diversity in the \nworkplace. \n \nRegarding the discrimination towards LGBTQ people and their rights, although there \nhave been significant steps forward (e.g. same-sex marriage, which is currently legal in \n22 countries), the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association \n(ILGA) reports that discrimination against LGBT individuals is still widespread. In the \nlatest world survey of sexual orientation laws (ILGA, 2016), the ILGA highlights that \nhomosexuality remains illegal in 73 criminalizing states, and of these, 13 states retain \nand in some cases apply the death penalty (Eddy & Rumens, 2017). In the US, LGBTQ \nworkers did not have any form of employment protection in 28 states, which means any \nLGBTQ worker could be fired on the basis of sexual orientation (Eddy & Rumens, \n3 \n \n2017). Across Europe, where LGBTQ individuals enjoy better employment protection, \n1 out of 5 LGBTQ employees report that they experience discrimination during job \ninterviews and at work (Catalyst, 2015).  \n \nEven if legislation is not always equally supportive for LGBTQ employees, an \nincreasing number of employers have taken on the responsibility to provide equality \nprovisions and benefits for their LGBT employees. They tend to surpass the legislation, \nimplementing D&I practices, aiming to a fully diverse and inclusive workplace for their \nLGBTQ existent and future employees, enhancing their employer brand and their \nattractiveness as LGBTQ friendly organizations. Organizational research on LGBTQ \nworkplace issues focuses exactly on how organizations confront the challenge of \ncreating LGBTQ diverse workforces (Colgan, Wright, Creegan, & McKearney, 2009; \nKöllen, 2013). The implementation of D&I policies helps organizations improve, \namongst other things, organizational productivity, increase corporate profits and \nearnings, enhance organizational problem-solving capabilities, and expand their market \nshare (Garnero, Kampelmann & Rycx, 2014; Richard, 2000). \n \nThe aim of this paper is to present a benchmarking tool for workplace LGBTQ equality, \nthe Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s “Corparate Equality Index”, which helps \norganizations create a working environment with no discrimination towards LGBTQ \nindividuals. The CEI rates the workplaces on LGBTQ equality and supports companies \nto manage diversity, helping employees to flourish and at the same time helping \ncompanies make a difference towards their competitors. The CEI assess the corporate \npolicies and practices of the American businesses, towards LGBTQ employees, \nconsumers, suppliers and the community, awarding the top rated employers for their \nefforts to promote LGBTQ equality in the workplace and the society (“Best Places to \nWork for LGBTQ Equality”).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nLiterature Review \nHuman Rights Campaign \nThe Human Rights Campaign Fund was founded in 1980, by Steve Endean, as one of \nthe first gay and lesbian political committee in the US. 15 years after, in 1995, under \nExecutive Director Elizabeth Birch, the organization expanded its reach far beyond \npolitical work and renamed to “Human Rights Campaign” (HRC) (Human Rights \nCampaing, n.d.) \nNowadays, the HRC is the largest civil rights organization in the US, working to \nachieve lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) equality (Human Rights \nCampaing, n.d.). It envisions a world without discrimination against LGBTQ people, a \nworld where these people can be fully open, honest and safe, not only at home, but also \nin every community and workplace. By inspiring and engaging individuals, HRC aims \nto promote fundamental fairness and equality for all LGBTQ Americans (Human Rights \nCampaign n.d.). It currently represents a force of more than 3 million members and \nsupporters in America and almost 30.000 followers on LinkedIn, a platform which is \nnowadays used a lot to address, promote, support LGBTQ equality in the workplace.   \n \nCorporate Equality Index 2018  \nThe Corporate Equality Index (CEI) is the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s tool, \nto rate the corporate policies and practices of the American businesses, towards LGBTQ \nemployees, consumers, suppliers and the community (Corporate Equality Index 2018, \n2017). In other words CEI rates the workplaces on LGBTQ equality. It has been \npublished annually since 2002 and it was originally modeled after the Gay and Lesbian \nValues Index, a rating system designed by Grant Lukenbill (Raeburn, 2004). In the 1st \nCEI, 13 businesses were awarded with a 100 percent rating, while in the latest edition \n(16th) of the CEI a record number of 609 businesses earned a top score of 100 percent. \nThis fact depicts the keen interest of the American corporations in LGBTQ equality \nissues in the workplace. For the purposes of this thesis, the 16th edition of CEI (the latest \none published) is used. \nIn the 2018 CEI report, having 609 major businesses of nearly every industry achieving \na score of 100 percent and the distinction of “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ \nEquality”, clearly shows that the vast majority of businesses in the US are substantially \ninvesting in LGBTQ totally inclusive work environments. They create and implement \n5 \n \nnon-discrimination policies, which allow their employees bring their real selves at work, \nevery day. Furthermore, they practically take care of their transgender employees, \nensuring equal protections under their non-discrimination policies, gender transition \nguidelines, and access to inclusive health care. This kind of culture transforms the top-\nscoring businesses to top-performing organizations and step by step LGBTQ diverse \nand inclusive workplaces are becoming the norm in the US (Corporate Equality Index \n2018, 2017). \nThe CEI 2018 contains 65 new businesses that opted into the survey. It includes Fortune \nmagazine’s 500 largest publicly traded businesses, American Lawyer magazine’s top \n200 revenue-grossing law firms (AmLaw 200) and many others public and private mid- \nand large-sized businesses. The Fortune 1000 list of the largest publicly traded \ncompanies was invited to take part in the survey for 7th year in a row. All these \nbusinesses take concrete steps to ensure greater equity for LGBTQ employees and their \nfamilies, with non-discrimination policies, benefits and practices (Corporate Equality \nIndex 2018, 2017).  \nRegarding the equality in the Fortune ranked firms: 230 out of 500 Fortune ranked \ncompanies achieves 100% rating. 91% of the Fortune 500 include “sexual orientation” \nin their nondiscrimination policies and 83% include “gender identity.” Over half of \nFortune 500 companies offer transgender-inclusive health care benefits (Corporate \nEquality Index 2018, 2017). \nTable 1: Top 20 Fortune Ranked Companies \n \nSource: (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017) \n6 \n \nSimilar Indexes do also exist in Europe, because diversity and inclusion issues in the \nworkplace are topics of great interest for companies worldwide. One of the most well-\nknown European LGBTQ Indexes is the Stonewall’s “Workplace Equality Index”, \nwhich includes UK businesses and the “Global Workplace Equality Index”, where \nmultinational organizations participate.  \n \nStonewall Workplace Equality Index \nStonewall was founded as an LGBT rights charity in 1989, by a small group of \npeople who were fighting against Section 28 of the Local Government Act. Section 28 \nwas an offensive piece of legislation designed to prevent the 'promotion' of \nhomosexuality at school, stigmatizing LGBT people and galvanizing the LGBT \ncommunity in general. Stonewall put the LGBT equality issues in the political \nforeground, gaining support and recognition from the political parties. Nowadays, it is \nbased in London and has offices in England, Scotland and Wales, being the largest \nLGBT rights organization not only in the UK, but also in the whole Europe. Stonewall’s \nfunds are raised through donations, sponsoring, or fundraising events, because it doesn’t \nreceive government funding. It is a member of the Equality and Diversity Forum, a \nnetwork of organizations aiming to progress on age, disability, gender, race, religion \nand belief and sexual orientation issues (Stonewall, n.d.).  \nStonewall’s key priorities are the empowerment of individuals, the transformation of \ninstitutions, the change in hearts and minds and of course the change in the legislation \nsystem. More specifically they support LGBT people to have a substantial impact and \nmake the difference at work, home and in the community. They transform \norganizations, creating an inclusive and accepting culture, helping them practically \nunderstand the benefits, which bring the LGBT people in the workplace. Furthermore, \nin order for the LGBT people to fully participate in the society, they help LGBT role \nmodels and allies to be visible and “present” in the public life. Last but not least, one of \ntheir major goals is lobby government to change laws, which are unequal for LGBT \npeople (Stonewall, n.d.).  \nDisciplined on its mission, Stonewall publishes annually its Workplace Equality Index, \na ranking of the top 100 employers for LBGT employees. The index was first launched \nin 2005 and till today is the UK’s leading benchmarking tool for LGBT inclusion in the \nworkplace. In order for the companies to enter the index, need to cover with evidence \n7 \n \n10 different areas of practice, from policy to community engagement. At the same time, \nStonewall collects feedback from employees through a survey, covering key indicators \nof workplace culture. Submissions are assessed by the Stonewall experts and then \nranked. The 100 organizations with the highest ranking are defined as “Top 100 \nEmployers for LGBT people”, as “Diversity Champions” (Stonewall, 2018). What is \nreally valuable for the organizations is the in-depth consultative feedback they receive, \nto plan their year ahead and further develop inclusive workplaces across UK. \nFurthermore, it is remarkable that the participation is free and is a unique opportunity \nfor the companies to improve their performance, towards other organizations of even \ncompetitors. In the Workplace Equality Index 2018 were participated 430 organizations \nacross a range of sectors (Workplace Equality Index, 2018). \nAdditional to the Workplace Equality Index, Stonewall developed the “Global \nWorkplace Equality Index”. Multinational organizations have the chance to participate \ncompletely free, assessing their progress on LGBT inclusion across all operational \ncountries. In other words, they can evaluate their efforts towards LGBT employees not \nonly in the UK, but also worldwide (Stonewall, 2018). \nEach organization should support with evidence its performance against a set of best \npractice criteria, which are split across nine different areas of employment policy and \npractice, examining both global working structures and the local activity: \n Section 1: Employee policy \n Section 2: Training \n Section 3: Staff engagement \n Section 4: Leadership \n Section 5: Monitoring \n Section 6: Procurement \n Section 7: Community engagement and understanding local context \n Section 8: Global mobility \n Section 9: Additional in-country activity \n(Stonewall, 2018). \nHigh-performing organizations win the title of “Top Global Employers” and receive in-\ndepth tailored feedback from Stonwall’s experts (Stonewall, 2018). \n8 \n \nIn order for the best practice criteria to be completely clear, it is important to have a \nlook in the findings or better in the statistics of the survey: \n 96% of entrants have one or more global senior champions for LGBT equality \n 88% of entrants have a global team or position working on LGBT diversity and \ninclusion \n 88% of entrants have a global LGBT network group for LGBT staff \n 84% of entrants have consulted in-country human rights organisations to \nunderstand the local context for LGBT people \n 84% of entrants promote themselves as being LGBT-inclusive on their global \nwebsites or social media platforms \n 68% of entrants have a global allies program \n 56% of entrants have senior leaders who advocated externally for legal equality \nfor LGBT people in partnership with local LGBT groups \n 48% of entrants have policies that protect LGBT staff from discrimination \nacross global operations \n 32% of entrants offer LGBT-inclusive training in all operational countries. A \nfurther 40% offered such training in some operational countries \n 16% of entrants have a transitioning at work policy covering more than half of \ntheir countries of operation and including information for the transitioning \nindividual, their manager and colleagues \n 16% of entrants have partnered with local LGBT groups in more than half of \ntheir operational countries \n(Top 100 Employers 2018, 2018) \nThe data depict that the organizations do take the needs and interests of their LGBTQ \ndiverse workforce seriously (Eddy & Rumens, 2017). As it is mentioned in the 2017 \nStonewall’s Top Employers report “We work with over 700 employers who recognize \nthat creating an inclusive workplace is not only the right thing to do, but is also crucial \nto their success” (Stonewall, 2017, p. 3). \nThe Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s CEI and the Stonewall’s Workplace \nEquality Index are the most famous Indexes in the US and in Europe respectively. It is \nobvious that Stonewall’s Index assesses similar criteria with HRC’s Index, like the non-\ndiscrimination policies, employee benefits, community engagement and public \ncommitment, organizational efficiency etc. These are actually the four pillars, on which \n9 \n \nthe CEI rating is based. For the purpose of this thesis the CEI have been chosen, \nbecause its methodology and rating criteria are more clear and detailed, all companies \n(and not only the awarded ones) are presenting, so there is a high level of transparency, \n(this matches to the US business mentality), in the US D&I issues in the workplace have \na long history and many trends arise from there, having an influence on the businesses \nworldwide.        \n \nThe evolution of the CEI criteria  \nThe HRC Foundation maintains a rigorous, fair, attainable and transparent rating \nsystem. It continually examines the rating criteria and when needed changes or adapts \nthem. Changes to the CEI criteria are necessary because: \n The landscape of legal protections for LGBTQ employees and their families \nchanges, both federally and from state to state \n Best practices need to be implemented, which meet the needs of LGBTQ \nemployees and ensure that LGBTQ people are treated fairly in every workplace \nand organizational environment \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017) \n \n \n \nTable 2: History of the CEI criteria changes and adaptations \n \nSource: Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017 \n10 \n \nFollowing the history of criteria changes and while CEI 2019 is in progress, an \noverview of the criteria changes in the following edition of CEI (2019) is presented. \nDomestic Partner Benefits: The parity principle  \nMarriage equality is undoubtedly a monumental step towards full equality, but LGBTQ \nindividuals remain at risk for discrimination in many other sectors of their life. A lot of \ndiscrimination exists against LGBTQ individuals in employment, housing, and access to \npublic places, federal funding, credit, education, jury services etc. Until LGBTQ \nAmericans have full equality through the Equality Act, the CEI will continuously try to \nfill the gap of federal and state law, better serving the U.S. human resources (Corporate \nEquality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nCEI 2019: In the name of parity and partnership, employers must offer both same- and \nopposite-sex partner benefits, in order to achieve a top score. The CEI looks beyond the \nlaw to actual best practices for LGBTQ employees and their families (Corporate \nEquality Index 2018, 2017).  \n \nTransgender - Inclusive Benefits: Removal of all Exclusions and Affirming \nComprehensive Coverage \nCEI 2018: HRC’s legal analysis on transgender health care coverage require that any \nprocedure offered to a cisgender individual must also be offered to a transgender or \ntransitioning individual, without exclusion (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nCEI 2019: Any blanket exclusion for transition-related care must be eliminated (i.e. \nconform to the law) and explicit affirmation of coverage is required to retain a high \nscore (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nSupplier Diversity: Aligning LGBTQ with Other Diverse Business Segments \nCEI 2018: Employers will continue earning credits for having an LGBTQ supplier \ndiversity program (public engagement) (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nCEI 2019: Employers with a supplier diversity program must include LGBTQ suppliers \nto maintain high score. Employers, who implement a supplier diversity program, \nwithout ensuring LGBTQ diversity, loose points (Corporate Equality Index 2018, \n2017).  \n11 \n \nRating System & Methodology \nThe HRC Foundation’s CEI rating system is designed for mid- to large-sized \nbusinesses, with 500 full time employees and above. The CEI’s framework is based on \nparity rather than prescription. It promotes the adoption of LGBTQ-specific practices \nand language within existing business contexts. Through the CEI, businesses can \ncompare their level of LGBTQ workplace inclusion, with the level of their competitors \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017).  \n \nThe CEI Rating system is based in four pillars:   \n Non-discrimination policies across business entities \n Equitable benefits for LGBTQ workers and their families \n Internal education and accountability metrics to promote LGBTQ inclusion \ncompetency \n Public commitment to LGBTQ equality  \nAn additional, supporting pillar (5) is that the businesses must not have any kind of \ninvolvement with anti-LGBT organizations or activity. (Corporate Equality Index 2018, \n2017) \n \nWhat Businesses are rated \nThe largest and most successful U.S. employers are invited to participate in the CEI. \nMore specifically are invited: \n Fortune magazine’s 1,000 largest publicly traded businesses (2016 Fortune \n1000) \n American Lawyer magazine’s top 200 revenue grossing law firms (2016 \nAmLaw 200). \n Any private-sector, for-profit employer with 500 or more full-time U.S. \nemployees can request to participate (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017) \n \nHow the survey data is collected  \nThe web-based CEI survey is sent every year to previous and prospective participants. \nHRC provides consultation, advisory, assistance during the process and reviews the \nsubmitted material. Invitations for the CEI 2018 survey were emailed and mailed in \nMay 2017 and the deadline for the responses was in August 2017. In addition to the \n12 \n \nself-reporting provided through the CEI survey, HRC investigates and cross-checks the \npolicies and practices of the businesses, any connections with organizations with anti-\nLGBTQ activity and possible efforts that undermine LGBTQ equality. If a business has \nany kind of involvement with anti-LGBTQ organization or activity, the HRC \nFoundation contacts the business and provides an opportunity to respond and ensure, \nthat no such action would occur in the future and to mitigate the harm done. If a \nbusiness will not do so, it is penalized 25 points (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nOfficial and unofficial ratings \nThe HRC Foundation may rate businesses that have not submitted a survey this year, if \nthe business had submitted one in previous years and the information is still accurate, or \nif the HRC Foundation has collected sufficient information to form an individual rating.  \n2205 organizations received an official invitation to take part in the survey. The CEI \n2018 officially rated: 344 Fortune 500 businesses, 104 Fortune 1000 businesses, 160 \nlaw firms, 339 additional major businesses. In total, 947 businesses are officially rated, \nin the 16th edition of the CEI. Additionally, 137 Fortune 500 businesses have rated \nunofficially, bringing the total to 1,084 rated businesses (Corporate Equality Index \n2018, 2017). \n  \nHow ratings are used  \nThe CEI results are available online for everyone, but more specifically aimed at \nLGBTQ and allied consumers, employers, shareholders and employees.   \n “HRC Foundation Employer Search” is a free online database of thousands of \nprivate and public sector U.S. employers \n “Workplace Equality 2018” is a consumer-oriented guide based on the CEI \nratings. The guide is distributed in the beginning of the winter holiday and \nshopping season, online via apps, to thousand LGBTQ consumers. According to \nWiteck Communications, the buying power of the US LGBTQ adult population \nfor 2016 was estimated at $971 billion. It is quite obvious, why it is important of \nthe businesses not only to participate in the survey, but also to gain a high \nposition on the list. The CEI results can influence the behavior of thousands \nLGBTQ consumers and allies. \n If a business collects the highest score of 100 points, it is named a “Best Place to \nWork for LGBTQ Equality”. High rated businesses can use the relevant logo in \n13 \n \ntheir Talent Acquisition & Employer Branding efforts, as well as in their internal \nHR Marketing activities, which aim to enhance the image of the employer, as an \nLGBTQ diverse and inclusive workplace. \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017) \n \nCEI criteria 2018  \nThe CEI rating criteria have four key pillars:  \n Non-discrimination policies across business entities \n Equitable benefits for LGBTQ workers and their families \n Internal education and accountability metrics to promote LGBTQ inclusion \ncompetency \n Public commitment to LGBTQ equality \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017) \n \nTable 3: Overview of the CEI 2018 Rating Criteria \nCriteria Points  \nEqual Employment Opportunity policies \n1a.

Employers will have 25 points deducted from their score for a large-\nscale official or public anti-LGBTQ blemish on their recent records \n \nSource: (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017) \n \nCriterion 1. Equal employment opportunity policy \nEmployers should prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity in all operations, as well as in their contractor/vendor standards (Corporate \nEquality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nCriterion 2. Employment benefits \nEmployers should provide equivalent spousal and partner (medical) benefits, as well as \n“soft” benefits – includes parity between employer-sponsored benefits for opposite-sex \nspouses and same-sex partners or spouses (e.g. bereavement leave, relocation/travel \nassistance, cash balance, retiree health care benefits etc.). They must ensure equal health \ncoverage for transgender individuals, without exclusions, including services related to \ngender transition (e.g. sex affirmation/ reassignment) (Corporate Equality Index 2018, \n2017). \n \nCriterion 3. Organizational LGBTQ competency  \nOrganizations must ensure a commitment to diversity and cultural competency, \nimplementing at least 3 of the following elements:  \n New hire training mentions that non-discrimination policy includes sexual \norientation and gender identity  \n Supervisors training that includes sexual orientation and gender identity as \ndiscrete topics \n15 \n \n Integration of sexual orientation and gender identity in professional \ndevelopment, or other leadership training \n Senior management/executive performance measures include LGBTQ diversity \nmetrics \n Gender transition guidelines with supportive restroom/ facilities, dress code etc. \n Anonymous employee engagement or climate surveys conducted on an annual \nor biennial basis allow employees the option to identify as LGBTQ \n Data collection forms that include employee race, ethnicity, gender, military and \ndisability status, include optional questions on sexual orientation and gender \nidentity \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017) \n \nFurthermore, the existence of an employee group or diversity council is required, in \norder for the organizational LGBTQ competency to be complete (Corporate Equality \nIndex 2018, 2017). \n \nCriterion 4. Public commitment \nOrganizations must demonstrate LGBTQ-specific efforts that extends across the firm, \nincluding at least three of the following: recruiting, supplier diversity, marketing or \nadvertising, philanthropy or public support for LGBTQ equality under the law and have \ninternal guidelines that prohibit philanthropic giving to non-religious organizations with \nan explicit policy of discrimination against LGBTQ people (Corporate Equality Index \n2018, 2017). \n \nCriterion 5  \nIf it is found, that if a business is involved in any kind of anti-LGBTQ activity or \norganization, it will lose 25 points. The firm is obliged to prove, that no such action \nwould occur again and to mitigate the harm done (Corporate Equality Index 2018, \n2017). \n \n \n16 \n \nFindings \nTable 4: Findings of the CEI 2018 \nCriteria Findings   \nEqual Employment Opportunity policies \n1a. Businesses That Prohibit Discrimination \nBased on Sexual Orientation in U.S. and \nGlobal Operations \n95% of CEI-rated employers provide \nemployment protections on the basis of \nsexual orientation in the U.S. and globally. \n1b. Businesses That Prohibit Discrimination \nBased on Gender Identity in U.S. and \nGlobal Operations \n93% of CEI-rated employers provide \nemployment protections on the basis of \ngender identity in the U.S. and globally. \nThis criterion has seen the most rapid \ngrowth of any other element of the CEI. \n1c. Businesses That Prohibit Discrimination \nBased on Sexual Orientation and Gender \nIdentity in their Contractor/Vendor \nstandards \n94% of CEI-rated employers require that \ntheir suppliers abide by a non-\ndiscrimination policy that is inclusive of \nsexual orientation and gender identity \nEmployment Benefits \n2a. Offers Equivalent Spousal and Partner \nMedical Benefits \n82% of CEI-rated businesses offer \ndomestic partner benefits and of those, \n89% extend these benefits to all partners, \nirrespective of the gender of the partner. \n2b. Parity Across Spousal and Partner \n“Soft” Benefits \n(half credit for parity across some, but \nnot all benefits) \n2c. Businesses That Offer at Least One \nTransgender-Inclusive Health Care Plan \n79% of CEI-rated employers afford \ntransgender-inclusive health care coverage \noptions through at least one firm-wide \nplan. This coverage includes: short-term \nleave, counseling by a mental health \nprofessional, hormone therapy, medical \nvisits to monitor hormone therapy and \nsurgical procedures \nOrganizational LGBTQ competency \n3a. Competency Training, Metrics, \nResources or Accountability Measures \n83% of CEI-rated employers offer a \nrobust set of practices to support \n17 \n \norganizational LGBTQ diversity \ncompetency \n3b. LGBTQ/Allies Employee Groups and \nDiversity Councils \n89% of CEI-rated employers have an \nemployee resource group or diversity \ncouncil that includes LGBTQ and allied \nemployees and programming \nPublic commitment \n4. Businesses That Positively Engage the \nExternal LGBTQ Community \n72% of CEI-rated businesses met the \nstandard of demonstrating at least three \nefforts of public commitment to the \nLGBTQ community – marketing, \nadvertising and recruitment efforts, \nphilanthropic contributions to LGBTQ \norganizations, LGBTQ diverse supplier \ninitiatives and public policy weigh-in – \nAND have inclusive philanthropic giving \nguidelines. \nAnti-LGBT activity \n5. Employers will have 25 points deducted \nfrom their score for a large-scale official \nor public anti-LGBTQ blemish on their \nrecent records \n \n \nNon-discrimination policies \nOne of the most fundamental steps for a firm to become more inclusive of LGBTQ \nemployees is the implementation of an equal opportunity/non-discrimination policy, \nwhich covers sexual orientation and gender identity as protected characteristics. As a \nresult, many employers in their effort to create and implement fully inclusive policies \nand practices in their workplaces, practically cover the gaps, the legislation often creates \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nFurthermore, 59% of CEI-rated employers operate outside US and 98% of them have \nfully inclusive, globally applicable non-discrimination policies and codes of conduct. \nThis means, that businesses implement their LGBTQ inclusive policies, even in \n18 \n \ncountries, where the legislation is almost nonexistent, with regard to LGBTQ protection \npolicies (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n   \nHowever, despite the anti-discrimination organizational policies, LGBTQ workers still \nexperience mistreatment and harassment, e.g. bullying or micro-aggressions \n(Galupo & Resnick, 2016; Pizer, Sears, Mallory, & Hunter, 2011). Many LGBTQ \nworkers put up with gay jokes for fear of losing connections or relationships with their \ncoworkers (Catalyst, 2015; Fidas & Cooper, 2015). Meyer (2003) mentions that stigma, \nprejudice, and discrimination can create a hostile and stressful social environment that \ncauses mental health problems. It is obvious that even though the CEI top rated \ncompanies try to create ideal conditions of equality in the workplace, the corporate \ninitiative itself is not enough.  \n \nEqual Benefits  \nIf businesses want to attract and retain talent, they should have a competitive benefits’ \npolicy, fully including LGBTQ employees and their families. LGBTQ-inclusive \nbenefits is an overall low-cost, high-return proposition for businesses. The HRC \nFoundation does not penalize an employer if a particular benefit is not offered, but holds \nemployers accountable to provide equal benefits to LGBTQ employees and their \nfamilies. In other words, all of the benefits extended to employees with a partner or \nspouse of an opposite sex must be extended to same-sex partners and spouses, as well. \nWhile there is no legal obligation to provide domestic partner benefits, businesses try to \ncover employees and their families as a function of their own needs in serving a diverse \nworkforce (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nRegarding the benefits for transgender employees, in order for a business to have top \nrating of 100%, needs to address the problem of transgender exclusion in coverage and \nfully affirm health care coverage for medically necessary transition-related care and \nother routine and chronic conditions (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nOrganizational LGBTQ competency \nAfter consolidating diverse and inclusive policies and guidelines, businesses need to \nimplement additional programs and educational schemes to enhance a culture of \ninclusiveness without discrimination (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017).  \n19 \n \n \nGender Transition Guidelines \nHaving understandable and accessible guidelines set the basis for a respectful and \nsuccessful workplace transition. A number of 459 employers submitted gender \ntransition guidelines, the vast majority of which were adopted from the HRC \nFoundation’s template guidelines (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nDiversity Training and Educational Programs \n88% of businesses offer inclusive diversity training. Diversity training, educational \nprograms, managerial and leadership training are essential to employee onboarding \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n  \nThe primary role of diversity training is to: \n Promote workplace harmony \n Assist individuals in learning about the values of others \n Improve cross-cultural communication \n Develop leadership skills \n Aid in employee retention  \n(Lockwood, 2005) \nThere are two primary diversity training: awareness based training and skills based \ntraining (Carnevale & Stone, 1994). The aim of awareness based training is to heighten \nawareness of diversity, by providing employees and managers with information about \ndiversity, strengthening the sensitivity to diversity, uncovering assumptions and biases, \nassessing current attitudes and values, correcting stereotypes and myths, fostering group \nand individual sharing (O’Donovan, 2018). Skills based training is primarily focused on \nbehavior, providing tools to promote effective interaction in a diverse organization \n(Carnevale & Stone, 1994). Furthermore, a training program focused on both \nsimilarities and differences among individuals, can be more useful with regard to \nenabling individuals to leverage similarities and differences to enhance creativity \n(Holladay & Quiñones, 2008). Focusing not just on differences, but also on similarities \nassists in increasing understanding and group harmony, enhancing the employees’ \nperceptions of a shared sense of purpose (O’Donovan, 2018). Last but not least, the \nsupport and investment of top leadership and top management in diversity policies in \n20 \n \ngeneral and in the diveristy training in particular is crucial to its success (Nancherla, \n2008). \nCounting LBGTQ Employees: Optional Self- Identification Questions \n49% of businesses offer question options to their employees to voluntarily disclose \ntheir sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, though anonymous \nsurveys or confidential HR records. The firms use them to track the progress of their \nLGBTQ inclusion efforts. Moreover, anonymous workplace climate surveys can be \nvaluable source of information for the engagement measures and their reach across the \nworkforce (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nAlthough there are even more LGBTQ individuals and role models who are out in the \nworkplace, the number of “out” senior LGBTQ leaders is quite small (Eddy & Rumens, \n2017). Coming out and sharing personal and sensitive information could be risky, but it \ncan lead to greater trust in a leader. As a result, LGBTQ leaders can develop trust with \ntheir followers by taking steps to disclose their sexual orientation, rather than waiting \nfor their followers to discover this themselves or through other sources (Bowring, \n2009). Apart from the self-identification questions an organization could offer in order \nto help LGBTQ employees to disclose their sexual orientation, the personal attitude \ntowards this issues plays a crucial role on how a LGBTQ employee is perceived from \nothers is the workplace.  \n \nSenior Leadership Metrics of Inclusion \n44% of businesses allow senior leaders to submit LGBTQ-focused diversity efforts, as \npart of their annual review of contributions to organizational diversity and inclusion \ngoals. By holding their senior leaders accountable, businesses are substantially raising \nawareness around diversity and inclusion in the organization (Corporate Equality Index \n2018, 2017). \n \nHowever, most employees do need some direction to what the diverse and inclusive \npolicies mean in their workplaces (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). Many \norganizations for instance, ask from their managers to deliver diversity strategies, but \nthey do not receiving the necessary training or support to do so (Monks, 2007). As a \n21 \n \nresult managers may be more reactive, concentrating on minimal compliance, rather \nthan being proactive, concentrating on possible positive outcomes (O’Donovan, 2018). \nOne method by which management commitment can be secured is to involve managers \nin the diversity management planning process, giving them ownership of diversity goals \n(Carnevale & Stone, 1994), even if many executives may be unsure of why they should \nlearn how to manage diversity (Thomas, 1990). This may be as a result of an issue \ndefined as Diversity Blindness (Moore, 1999), which does not consider diversity an \nissue that must be addressed, resulting in diversity being underestimated or even \nignored. \n \nLGBTQ/Allies Employee Groups and Diversity Councils \nThe role of employee resource groups is crucial for an employer, on its efforts to be \nfully inclusive. LGBTQ employee groups foster the visibility of diverse workforce in \nthe business. Through these groups LGBTQ employees can be “out” and “bold”, \nmaking their presence felt in the workplace, acting like change agents for the whole \nbusiness. In order for the employees to really experience inclusion, they have to be \nnetworked, involved, and be a part of the decision-making process (Barak, 2016). \nFurthermore, the employee resource groups give to LGBTQ employees and allies the \nchance to form their own networks, helping business pursue their corporate goals. At \nthe same time these businesses have a competitive advantage towards their competitors, \nbecause they attract and retain diverse talents, due to the inclusive culture they maintain \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n  \nOf those CEI-rated companies with an officially recognized LGBTQ employee group, \n97% reported being expressly for LGBTQ and allied employees. ERGs have embraced \nallies as members of the full LGBTQ community, as allies bring their own unique voice \nto workplace equality (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). Evidence claim that as \nthe number of allies grows, the support for LGBTQ rights also increases (Lewis & \nGossett, 2008; Lewis, 2011). LGBTQ groups in the business world, as well as in the \nreal world, need their supporters and the role of straight supporters (heteronormativity) \ncould be very helpful. Being obvious that LGBTQ employee groups have straight allies \nand supporters, helps LGBTQ employees feel included, bringing their real selves at \nwork.    \n \n22 \n \nFurthermore, 97% of employee groups rated in the CEI are sponsored by an executive \nchampion. The majority of executive champions identify as allies and 38% of them are \nopenly LGBTQ. This percentage depicts that a lot of work should be done, regarding \nthe coming out of employees, especially of the executive ones in the workplace \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nPublic Commitment  \n \nPromoting business growth through visibility \nPublic commitment of the CEI businesses has been measured through individual \nengagements, like marketing, advertising and recruitment efforts, philanthropic \ncontributions, LGBTQ supplier diversity and public policy weigh-in (Corporate \nEquality Index 2018, 2017).  \n \nMany CEI rated employers attend professional events like the annual “Out & Equal \nWorkplace Summit”, “Lavender Law” conference and “Reaching Out” MBA career \nexpo etc. aiming to attract diverse talent, because they know that diversity will offer \nthem the innovation they need, in order to pursue the corporate goals (Corporate \nEquality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nSupporting though philanthropy \nFinancial support or donations of products or services can enhance a business’s profile \nin the LGBTQ community. These efforts are usually part of the strategic corporate goals \nand depict the culture, mission and vision of the firm (Corporate Equality Index 2018, \n2017). \n \nCorporate Giving Guidelines \nA top-rated business must prohibit philanthropic help to non-religious organizations that \nhave a written policy of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender \nidentity or have a policy permitting its own chapters, affiliates, etc. to discriminate \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \n \n23 \n \nSupplier Chain Management \nSupplier diversity programs ensure that the supply chain process includes opportunities \nfor minority-owned businesses e.g. women-owned, veteran-owned and, more recently, \nLGBTQ-owned businesses. Supplier diversity initiatives are a win-win relationship for \nboth the LGBTQ-owned businesses and the businesses that contract them. The benefits \nfor these businesses are multiple, including a supply chain that better reflects the diverse \ncommunities, where they operate, and in turn ensuring innovation and growth \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nBusiness for Equality in Public Policy \nDuring the state legislative sessions in 2017, over 130 anti-LGBTQ bills proliferated \nacross the states. In turn, businesses spoke out and rebuked attempts to undermine \nLGBTQ civil rights at record rates (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nHRC’s Business Coalition for the Equality Act is a group of over 100 leading U.S. \nemployers that support the Equality Act, a federal legislation that would provide the \nsame basic protections to LGBTQ people as are provided to other protected groups \nunder federal law (Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). \n \nA best employer to work for LGBTQ equality \nIn the 2018 CEI report, 609 major businesses of every industry achieved a score of 100 \npercent and the distinction of “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality”. Following \nthe presentation and analysis of the findings of the CEI, a best employer to work for \nLGBTQ equality, is presented, trying to delve deeper into the policies and practices it \nimplements for its LGBTQ employees and the society in general. The Coca-Cola Co. is \na global player, a leading employer in the food and beverage industry worldwide, \nhaving a score of 100 percent on the CEI every year since its launch in 2006. The Coca-\nCola Company has a long history, regarding the protection of employees from \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. This \ncommitment manifests itself in its brands’ advertisements, as well as 1in its daily \noperations (Staff, 2018). \n \n \n24 \n \nCoca-Cola’s Diversity and inclusion \nRespect for human rights is a core component of the business. The latest version of the \ncompany’s Human Rights Policy was launched on 11 December 2017, based on 12 \npillars: \n Respect for Human Rights \n Community and Stakeholder Engagement \n Diversity and Inclusion \n Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining \n Safe and Healthy Workplace \n Workplace Security \n Forced Labor and Human Trafficking \n Child Labor \n Work Hours, Wages and Benefits \n Land Rights and Water Resources \n Healthy Lifestyles \n Guidance and Reporting for Employees \n(The Coca-Cola Company, n.d.) \nCompany supports, that each employee is responsible to maintain a work environment \nthat reflects respect for human rights, free from discrimination and harassment (The \nCoca-Cola Company, n.d.). \nThe Human Rights Policy and Supplier Guiding Principles set a strong basis for \nmanaging company’s operations not only in the headquarters, but also around the globe. \nAs they characteristically mention in their website, they “embrace the brand promise to \npromote inclusion, celebrate diversity and champion equality”, fostering their future \ngrowth and promoting creativity and innovation (The Coca-Cola Company, 2018).   \nTheir diversity and inclusion strategy is being built on four pillars: Workplace, \nMarketplace, Community and Partners, aiming to attract, develop, engage and retain a \nglobal talent mix that will foster high-performance growth culture. In order to pursue \nthis goal, they share diversity and inclusion metrics across the global workforce, \nhighlighting progress. They look at the full spectrum of diversity with an inclusive \nmindset, including gender, ethnicity, age, ability, sexual orientation, gender identity, \nmilitary service, nationality and religion (The Coca-Cola Company, 2018) \n25 \n \nSome of the diversity and inclusion practices the company implements are mentioned \nbelow. They have Diversity Advisory Councils and Business Resource \nGroups (BRGs) with more than 7,000 members globally. Through the BRGs they shape \na fully inclusive culture, advancing diverse talent and serving as a hub for fresh ideas. In \n2017, they conducted the first diversity and inclusion system assessment. Nine of our \nlargest bottlers provided information about diversity strategies, programs, initiatives and \nmetrics, sharing best practices and supporting one another in diversity and inclusion \nefforts (The Coca-Cola Company, 2018). Beginning from 2015 to 2017 they proactively \nengaged approx. 180 experts, conducting workshops related to diversity an inclusion. \nThey actively support supplier diversity, by spending approximately $650-700 million \nwith diverse suppliers in 2017, contributing to their commitment to spend $1 billion by \n2020. Through their Supplier Training & Empowerment Program (STEP), they \nhelp women-owned suppliers stay competitive and grow their businesses. (The Coca-\nCola Company, 2018) \nThey implement diversity education programs, including Diversity Training, a Diversity \nSpeaker Series and a Diversity Library. In 2017, a new parental benefits policy \nimplemented, whereby 6 weeks of paid leave extended not only to all new mothers, but \nalso to fathers. The move was championed by ‘Coca-Cola Millennial Voices’, a group \nof young employees, which is responsible to ensure that there is a healthy level of \nemployee retention in millennial consumers and staff members (McSweeney, 2016). \nWith regard to public commitment, which is the 4th pillars of the CEI rating system, the \ncompany demonstrated support for diversity and inclusion in 2017, by signing onto \nthe CEO Action for Diversity Inclusion Pledge and Catalyst CEO Champions for \nChange Pledge. (The Coca-Cola Company, 2018) \n \nCoca-Cola’s LGBT Diversity and Inclusion \nBut, what are actually the Coca-Cola’s milestones, with regard to LGBTQ diversity and \ninclusion? The following paragraphs present some important corporate policies and \npractices used by the Coca-Cola Company, in order to foster LGBTQ inclusion. \nNon-discrimination policy \n26 \n \nFirst and foremost, the Coca-Cola Company has long protected employees from any \nkind of discrimination, based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and it has a \nperfect score on the CEI, every year since its launch in 2006. \nCoca Cola was among some of the early leaders, embracing gay rights and being a \nleading employer on its field has influenced many other business, towards the LGBTQ \nequality. Other companies followed Coca-Cola’s example, in order to remain \ncompetitive in their efforts to attract and retain talent. (Kell, 2016). Furthermore, it was \na member of HRC’s Business Coalition for Equality, formed to support the Equality \nAct. The Act would establish explicit, permanent protections against discrimination, \nbased on sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing, public access, \nfederal funding, education etc (Advocate, 2017). \nEqual benefits \nThe company does implement an equal, non-discriminatory benefits policy, offer equal \nbenefits to all the employees. A milestone for the business was that in 2011, it began \noffering transgender-inclusive health insurance coverage. In 2015, it began assisting \nwith the costs of taxes imposed on eligible U.S. employees, whose same-sex spouse or \npartner was enrolled in health benefits and who lived in states, where the same sex \nmarriage is not recognized (Jackson, 2018; Staff, 2018).  \nOrganizational LGBTQ competency \nCoca-Cola has been on the forefront of ensuring equality for its LGBTQ employees and \nstakeholders. Apart from the above mentioned measures (Human Rights Policy, \nDiversity & Inclusion Strategy, Diversity Advisory Councils, metrics, workshops, \neducation programs, supplier diversity etc.), that promote LGBTQ competency, the \ncompany has an active LGBTQA Business Resource Group (BRG) in operation for \nalmost 15 years (Staff, 2018).  \nPublic Commitment \nAs already mentioned, Coca-Cola was also one of the first companies in the U.S., \nsupporting the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and it stood along 379 businesses \nin supporting the marriage equality. Moreover, in partnership with local and national \nLGBTQ organizations, Coca-Cola launched the “Next Generation LGBTQ Leaders’ \nInitiative”. It is a program designed to connect, educate and inspire young LGBTQ \nleaders to advance the community across all sectors (Staff, 2018).  \n27 \n \nHIV / AIDS policy \nIn 2008, Coca-Cola launched a Global HIV/AIDS Policy, which outlines the company’s \nprinciples on confidentiality, non-discrimination, education, testing, treatment and \nreasonable accommodation. It is guided by international standards including the \nInternational Labor Organization's code of practice on HIV/AIDS and the world of \nwork, and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. It is mentioned as a \ncompany’s LGBTQ milestone, because the HIV is a huge issue for the LGBTQ \ncommunity itself. It is impressive having a company, trying to create global HIV \nawareness, among their employees (The Coca-Cola Company, n.d.). \nLGBTQ equality, a company-wide issue \nTaking into account the above mentioned policies, it is obvious that LGBTQ equality \nand inclusion is a company-wide issue for the Coca-Cola Company. They celebrate the \npride month (June), organizing many events worldwide or participating in the pride \nparades (The Coca-Cola Co. UK, 2018). They do not hesitate to change their social \nmedia presence, supporting the LGBTQ community or to change the packaging of their \nproducts, using the rainbow colors, launching relevant LGBTQ videos or whole \ncampaigns. One of the most successful LGBTQ campaigns took place in Brazil last year \non the International LGBT Pride Day, where they created a coca cola can, which \ncontained fanta (not cola). Using their most important asset, their product, they tried to \n“criticize” the anti LGBTQ Brazilian phrase “This coke is a fanta”, which actually mean \nthat someone is gay. Because of all these systematic efforts, LGBTQ shoppers are \nhighly aware that this company actively supports their community, loyally \nspending money to support this or any other business, which they recognize as an \nLGBTQ ally. \nLast but not least, it is impressive that Coca-Cola implements the above mentioned \npolicies for years, not only in the US headquarters, but also in their operations around \nthe globe, something that can be justified, by visiting the websites of the Coca-Cola’s \nbottling companies. There can be found all the policies and practices these stakeholders \nimplement, making the Coca-Cola Company one the most inclusive LGBTQ employers \nworldwide, ready to influence many other business or even governments, towards the \nLGBTQ equality. The following table presents the score on the Coca-Cola Company on \nthe CEI. Having a top score of 100 percent, the company is named a Best Employer to \nwork for LGBTQ equality.  \n28 \n \nTable 5: The CEI rating of The Coca-Cola Co.  \nPolicies and Benefits of The Coca-Cola Co. \n Policy description Rating \n Non-discrimination  \npolicy includes sexual orientation for U.S. and global operations* \n+ 15 \n Non-discrimination policy includes gender identity for U.S. and \nglobal operations* \n+ 15 \n Contractor/vendor standards include sexual orientation and gender \nidentity alongside other named categories \n+ 5 \n Company-provided domestic partner health insurance (including \nparity in spousal and partner COBRA, dental, vision and domestic \npartners legal dependent coverage) \n+ 10 \n Parity in spousal/partner soft benefits (bereavement leave; \nsupplemental life insurance; relocation assistance; adoption \nassistance; joint/survivor annuity; pre-retirement survivor annuity; \nretiree healthcare benefits; employee discounts) \n+ 10 \n Offers equal health coverage for transgender individuals without \nexclusion for medically necessary care \n+ 10 \n Organizational LGBT cultural competency (diversity trainings, \nresources or accountability measures) \n+ 10 \n Company-supported LGBT employee resource group or firm-wide \ndiversity council that includes LGBT issues, OR would support a \nLGBT employee resource group with company resources if \nemployees expressed an interest \n+ 10 \n Engages in appropriate and respectful advertising and marketing \nor sponsors LGBT community events, organizations, or legislative \nefforts \n+ 15 \n Engages in action that would undermine the goal of LGBT \nequality \n0 \n Final Rating 100 \n*10 reflects partial points for U.S. only. 15 points indicates full credit. \n Source: Human Rights Campaign Buying for Workplace Equality Guide, 2018 \n \n29 \n \nConclusions \n \nBy using the CEI as a guide, businesses can ensure that their existing LGBTQ and \nbenefits policies and practices are inclusive for the LGBTQ employees and their \nfamilies, resulting in greater attraction and retention of a talented, diverse workforce \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). Businesses can also use the CEI as a self-\nassessment tool, in order to rate their current status towards the LGBTQ inclusion, \nfocusing on particular sectors they may need improvement. Focusing and investing on \nthe 4 pillars of the CEI (non-discrimination policies, equal benefits, organizational \nLGBTQ competency, public commitment), businesses could set a strong basis to create \nan LGBTQ inclusive workplace. \n \nThe 4 pillars on which the rating system of the CEI is based, reveal the need for \nconceptually expanding how we frame diversity and inclusion in the businesses \n(Corporate Equality Index 2018, 2017). Managing diversity is a matter of the \norganization as a whole, if the organization aims to get substantial results. It is an active \nphenomenon, which involves coordinating the differences of employees to peruse \nstrategic organizational goals (Friday & Friday, 2003). That’s why D&I are considered \ncompany-wide issues. Regarding inclusion, organizations should examine inclusion \nefforts at an overall organizational level, at an individual level, as well as at a team \nlevel. Fostering inclusion is an ongoing process and organizations should operate taking \nfor granted that inclusion is not a static concept, with employees either perceiving or not \nperceiving inclusion, but it is contextually dependant (O’Donovan, 2018). Businesses \nare advised to monitor inclusion continually, ensuring that employee’s perceptions of \ninclusion remain, even when operating in another context (e.g. on a different team or \ndepartment) (O’Donovan, 2017). \n \nIt becomes obvious, that how employees experience diversity and inclusion in the \nworkplaces, which are claimed to be LGBTQ inclusive (due to indexes like the CEI or \nStonewall’s), is an issue of utmost importance and academic research is already \nfocusing on this issue (David, 2016; Riach, Rumens, & Tyler, 2014). Although \nemployers are working to overcome the lack on legislation and become more gay-\nfriendly, harassment directed at LGBTQ employees still exists, making the workplaces \nhostile, evolving forms of discrimination such as microaggressions and ostracism \n(DeSouza et al., 2017). It is important, therefore, that organizations should uncover the \n30 \n \nneeds of employees with regard to what will result in feelings of inclusion, and clearly \naddress those needs (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002). One of the methods for doing so is to \nsimply ask their employees (Ferdman, 2003). LGBTQ inclusive initiatives are created \nand implemented focusing on employees, but sometimes the voice of employees is not \nheard, in the extent it should be. There is a number of HR tools and methods, which \ncould help organizations address the needs of their workforce on issues regarding the \nD&I (e.g. diversity training initiatives, performance reviews, employee engagement or \nwellbeing surveys, coaching/mentoring activities etc.). Many of these methods are used \nextensively and successfully from top rated organizations in the CEI or similar indexes. \nThe Coca-Cola Company for instance uses all these tools properly, enhancing its image \nas one of the most inclusive employers worldwide.    \n \nThe CEI, as well as other related indexes (e.g. Stonewall’s Workplace Equality Index), \nis a key roadmap for businesses to LGBTQ inclusion. However, it cannot serve as a \nholistic assessment of any employer’s unique workplace culture or individual \nexperiences (CEI). These Indexes being often criticized that are created by industry \nleaders or large-sized businesses based on the best practices they currently use. Smaller \norganizations that do not have the necessary resources to adopt these practices are \nindirectly excluded. These best practices can often reflect empty public declarations on \ncorporate websites, but bear little resemblance with the climate and practices of the \norganizations. So, it is worth repeating again that businesses must interrogate how \nLGBT workplace diversity and inclusion is understood and experienced by LGBT \nworkers, in their own words (Tayar, 2017). Moreover, taking into account only the fact \nthat a business is rated as a top inclusive employer is not enough and an extensive \nsearch on what this business actually does for the LGBTQ inclusion in necessary. This \neffort is made on this paper, presenting the Coca-Cola Company, a top rated CEI \nemployer for years. \n \nFurthermore, even if the aim of this paper is to present the CEI, as a benchmarking tool \nfor LGBTQ equality in general, it should not be forgotten, that each business should \nadapt the context to its needs. The legal system in the US is different in comparison to \nthe legal system in Europe, let alone the legislation between European countries or \nStates. In some countries the LGBTQ people are fighting for their basic rights, while \nsome other countries have already been many steps forward, towards the LGBTQ \ninclusion in the workplace and the society in general. There are many differences in the \n31 \n \ncultural context and as a result the business mentality between organizations, willing to \nuse the CEI as a tool, even if these organizations operate globally. All these limitations \nshould be taken into account from businesses, which would like to use the CEI \neffectively and successfully. Moreover, these limitations could set the basis for the \nfuture research, on which the investigation of the feelings and “voices” of the \nemployees, regarding the LGBTQ inclusion in awarded employers, should be of a high \npriority.    \n \nLast but not least, taking for granted that that discrimination and practices against \nLGBTQ equality still exist not only in the workplace, but also in the social context; not \nonly in developing but also in developed countries, it is obvious that corporate initiative \nalone is not enough for cracking down the inequality towards LGBTQ individuals. The \nfindings of Indexes focusing on LGBTQ equality in the workplaces can indeed be of \nvalue for organizations willing to make a difference, trying to improve the quality of life \nof so many people. The public commitment of these employers is of utmost importance, \nbecause through their active LGBTQ support, as well as through the public actions of \ntheir LGBTQ role models (executives) they can influence governments’ policies, for a \nLGBTQ friendly legislation. Besides that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that: \n \n“Anyone can succeed when they can bring their whole selves to work. Business is \nbetter with 100% of everyone.” (Involve, 2018) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nBibliography  \n \nAdvocate. (2019). 10 Companies Leading the Way on Global LGBTI Rights.

    "abstract": "Διπλωματική εργασία--Πανεπιστήμιο Μακεδονίας, Θεσσαλονίκη, 2019.The purpose of this paper is to present the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index (CEI) as a benchmarking tool, for LGBTQ+ equality in the workplace. The analysis of the Index follows the four pillars, on which the rating system of the CEI is based: non-discrimination policies, equal benefits for the LGBTQ+ employees, organizational LGBTQ+ competency and public commitment. The evolution of the criteria during the years, the methodology, the rating system and the recent criteria of the CEI are presented, delving deeper into the analysis of its findings. These findings offer a list of “best practices”, which could be used from organizations to foster LGBTQ+ inclusion in their workplaces, gaining a major advantage, towards their competitors. In order to highlight the benefits of implementing LGBTQ+ inclusive practices and policies in the workplace, a top-rated company in the CEI, for consecutive years since its launch, is presented. Concluding, the CEI could be used as a self-assessment tool for employers interested in fostering LGBTQ+ equality and inclusion. It could be a useful tool, providing LGBTQ+ inclusive “best practices”. However, diversity and inclusion (D&I) issues in the workplace, should be conceptually expanding, because D&I are practically company-wide issues. It is also pointed out, that the CEI or other similar indexes are not a panacea for LGBTQ+ equality. The “voices” of the employees, working on awarded LGBTQ+ inclusive employers do matter and they should be taken seriously into account",
