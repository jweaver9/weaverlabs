Between the COVID-19 pandemic, a long overdue reckoning with systemic racism, the economic uncertainty brought on by the pandemic, and a bitterly partisan election cycle that threatened to upend multiracial democracy in the United States, the world seemed to pivot from crisis to crisis. No one was immune — not even those in philanthropy.In the midst of an eventful year, CHANGE Philanthropy conducted a second Diversity Among Philanthropic Professionals (DAPP) Survey. The DAPP Survey and Report aim to help the philanthropic community better understand its workforce and leadership. The DAPP survey is unique in soliciting anonymous self-reporting from individuals on the staff and board of participating foundations, helping grantmakers to accurately assess the culture and climate of their institutions. The 2020 DAPP Report offers a snapshot of the philanthropic sector’s workforce in a very specific space and time — in the chaotic year that was 2020.The 2020 DAPP report is intended to be a tool for philanthropy to identify trends, gaps, and opportunities for improvement in diversity and inclusionary practices in the sector. With the creation of the CHANGE Philanthropy Reception of Identity Index (RII), it also aims to help both individual foundations and the philanthropic sector assess their workplace culture. The RII presents for philanthropy an entirely new rubric to gauge how foundations recognize the various components of an individual’s identity along an axis that includes: actualized, celebrated, acknowledged, invisibilized, erased, exploited.Beyond the aggregate findings reported here, participating foundations with ten or more staff and board, who recruited a statistically significant number of responses to the survey, received a custom report on their own demographics and workplace culture. In 2020, 31.5 percent of participating foundations qualified for an individualized report.IntroductionThe 2020 Diversity Among Philanthropic Professionals Report   ///   7 The DAPP survey and report are unique in philanthropy, on account of: > ANONYMOUS SELF-REPORTING — while other reports rely on information collected by a foundations’ human resources team, this report asks participants to self-identify. > QUESTION DEPTH — participants are asked a full range of race and ethnicity questions, in addition to other identity factors including gender, sexual orientation, immigration status, disability status, religious affiliation, and more. > QUESTION INCLUSIVITY AND FLEXIBILITY — all questions were formulated with the input of the 10 CHANGE Philanthropy partners and the Presidents’ Council on Disability Inclusion in Philanthropy, and most questions offered participants a write-in option. > STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT — this survey was also designed to align with other sector-wide research and be integrated into future research.While the CHANGE Philanthropy RII is one of the biggest additions to the 2020 DAPP Survey and Report, it isn’t the only improvement. There were also changes made to align with current best practices in demographic research, changes made to align the DAPP better with other field research on the demographics of those working in philanthropy, and the addition of new questions about an individual’s identity. The 2020 evolutions include: > A new question about tenure at a respondent’s organization and tenure in the field of philanthropy; > An expanded question about disability status developed in consultation with the Disability & Philanthropy Forum; > A new question about religious affiliation;  > Expanded sections for the various racial and ethnic groups that includes multi-racial people who identify as that race or ethnicity in combination with another race or ethncity; > A modification to how we ask about a respondent’s role to align this report with the roles in the Council on Foundations’ Grantmakers Salary and Benefits Report; and > New questions about a respondent’s perceptions of their workplace, which were used to create the Change Philanthropy Reception of Identity Index.The DAPP survey and report is a landmark tool for analyzing the philanthropic sector’s ongoing commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; providing a temperature gauge for progress towards a more inclusive sector. This is intended to be a pulse and reality check for grantmakers and a biennial effort.

The DAPP survey is unique in soliciting anonymous self-reporting from individuals on the staff and board of participating foundations, helping grantmakers to accurately assess the culture and climate of their institutions. The DAPP Survey is conducted via an anonymous survey sent directly to the board and staff of participating foundations. All data is collected and stored by a third party, SMU DataArts. Partnering with SMU DataArts allowed all responses to be collected securely and completely anonymously. A wide variety of grantmaking institutions were invited to participate in the survey through multiple channels. The survey was widely publicized for months in CHANGE Philanthropy’s monthly e-newsletter, with a series of community-specific infographics utilizing the 2018 DAPP findings. The survey was shared by all CHANGE Philanthropy partner organizations and a number of other philanthropy-serving organizations. CHANGE Philanthropy staff presented to several networks of human resources directors in philanthropy, particularly those representing large foundations. Finally, CHANGE Philanthropy staff conducted individualized outreach to executives and human resources staff at dozens of foundations, with a focus on attaining a wide range of funders in terms of foundation type, geography, and mission.Once an institution had committed to participate in the survey, the human resources director or other senior staff distributed the survey to all staff and, in most cases, to the board of directors. The survey was always distributed with the clear communication and assurance that all answers were being collected by a third party, SMU DataArts, and would be completely anonymous, with SMU DataArts securely collecting and storing responses, and only reporting findings in aggregate.The survey itself took approximately five minutes to complete, and included questions related to participants’ role and seniority within their organization, tenure at their institution and in philanthropy, location, age, gender identity, intersex status, sexual orientation, place of birth, race and ethnicity, disability status, and religious affiliation. The 2020 DAPP built on the 2018 DAPP with the addition of new perception questions - including the new CHANGE Philanthropy Reception of Identity Index (RII).The 2020 DAPP Survey opened on December 1, 2020 and closed on February 19, 2021.In total, 2,390 individuals from 124 foundations participated — a nearly 250 percent increase in the number of participating foundations and a more than 150 percent increase in the number of individuals taking the survey. Fifty-four percent of individuals who received the survey responded, a higher rate than the 2018 DAPP and one of the highest rates of any such survey SMU DataArts has conducted. As a result, the findings are representative of the compostion of the 124 foundations.MethodologyThe 2020 Diversity Among Philanthropic Professionals Report   ///   9 GENERAL FINDINGS   Race & Ethnicity2018 FINDINGS37.8% PEOPLE OF COLOR(TOTAL)60.3%WHITE1.1%DECLINE TO STATE0.8%DIFFERENTIDENTITY8.9%ASIAN11.1%BLACK/ AFRICANAMERICAN1.6%INDIGENOUS6.3%LATINX1.6%MIDDLE EASTERN9.5%MORE THAN ONERACE/ETHNICITY2020 FINDINGS45.3% PEOPLE OF COLOR(TOTAL)52.3%WHITE2.0%DECLINE TO STATE0.4%DIFFERENTIDENTITY9.6%ASIAN13.5%BLACK/ AFRICANAMERICAN0.8%INDIGENOUS8.7%LATINX0.5%MIDDLE EASTERN12.2%MORE THAN ONERACE/ETHNICITYPEOPLE WORKING IN PHILANTHROPY, BY RACE AND ETHNICITYThe 2020 Diversity Among Philanthropic Professionals (DAPP) Survey found that people of color account for 45.3 percent of the staff and board at participating foundations.

We have to measure and report on these critical measures of diversity  if we want to improve and have philanthropy realize its own highest aspirations for solving problems and building a better society. I especially urge White leaders in philanthropy to take particular notice of the Reception of Identity Index section of the report. Fewer than half of people of color working in philanthropy feel that their racial identity is actualized — meaning they feel recognized, valued, and have agency to authentically engage in their organizations. Far too many of our colleagues report their racial identity is unseen, ignored, erased or exploited.

By comparison, the 2018 DAPP survey found that 16.2 percent of the staff and board at participating foundations identified lesbian, gay, bisexual, or asexual. However, this decline could be attributable to a new survey option to select, “My sexual orientation is not listed here.” Survey participants could then opt to describe sexual orientation in their own terms, as can be viewed in the word cloud on page 17. A noteworthy 6.6 percent of survey respondents identified with a different identity than lesbian or gay, bisexual, asexual, or heterosexual. In fact, the number of self-identified heterosexuals also dropped, from 80.4 percent in 2018 to 77.2 percent in 2020.Based on write-in responses, the most common of which was queer, we believe the majority of respondents who marked different identity would fit under the broad LGBTQ umbrella.

Whereas other research demonstrated that the majority of LGBTQ people working in the coporate sector are “out”.

Transgender women are people who were assigned male at birth and identify as female. Transgender men are people who were assigned female at birth and identify as male.”The report also defines gender non-conforming people as individuals who “have, or are perceived to have, gender expressions that do not conform to traditional or societal expectations” and genderqueer people as individuals who “do not categorically identify as either female or male.” This is similar to non-binary individuals who reject the male/female gender binary.To learn more about transgender communities and how philanthropy can support them, check out Grantmakers United for Trans Communities (GUTC), an initiative of Funders for LGBTQ Issues.NOTE: Each word cloud in this report contains all of the write-in answers provided for the given category.

Intersex people are born with these differences or develop them in childhood. There are many possible differences in genitalia, hormones, internal anatomy, or chromosomes, compared to the usual two ways that human bodies develop.”According to interACT, about 1.7 people are born intersex. By comparison, 1 to 2 percent of people are born with red hair and only 0.3 percent of people are born as identical twins. You might know red-haired people or identical twins. You might just as easily know intersex people.Intersex people may not always know they are intersex for a variety of reasons. To learn more, please visit interACT’s website at interactadvocates.org.

Specifically, the CHANGE Philanthropy RII asked how respondents felt their organization recognized their race and ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability status, religion or belief system, and country of origin. They were asked to measure the reception along a scale defined as follows:(For more on the CHANGE Philanthropy Reception of Identity Index (RII), including the exact language of the question, see appendix B.)In most instances, people working in philanthropy felt generally positive about the reception of their identities in the workplace. Across all DAPP respondents, 85.6 percent felt their workplace received their race or ethnicity positively. However, there was a gap between people of color and white respondents. While less than 4 percent of white people working in philanthropy noted a negative reception to their race or ethnicity, 10.8 percent of people of color working in philanthropy reported a negative reception to their race or ethnicity.

It found a sharp divide between the two when it came to their staff and boards. Foundations with a social justice focus had a higher percentage of people of color; lesbian, gay, and bisexual people; and people with disabilities on their boards and staff.So what divides existed in 2020?As we explored foundations with an explicit commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion in their mission, vision, or values, we found that those foundations were more diverse than foundations without an explicit commitment.
