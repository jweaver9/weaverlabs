It distillsfindings from more than 400 pages of researchamassed over three years as part of the NationalCommittee for Responsive Philanthropy’s Grantmakingfor Community Impact Project.1The project documented $26.6 billion in benefitsfor taxpayers and communities in 13 states, and foundthat every dollar grantmakers and other donorsinvested in policy and civic engagement provided areturn of $115 in community benefit.The paper provides solid evidence of the impacts offoundation-funded policy advocacy, community organ-izing and civic engagement. It explains how these strate-gies create stronger communities and why they are suc-cessful. It provides a profile of many grantmakers whocurrently fund these types of strategies, and it offers sug-gestions for funders who want to start leveraging theirgrant dollars for maximum results. The full series ofseven studies and an interactive database of all docu-mented policy wins is available at www.ncrp.org/gcip. Why would foundation leaders want to change theway they approach their grantmaking? Most fundersunderstand that local, state and federal governmentspending toward education, health care and humanservices far surpasses charitable donations and philan-thropic grants to these causes. Yet, many grantmakerscontinue to operate as if they can make a meaningfuldifference by applying Band-Aids to big problems withtheir relatively small resources. This report describes the work of funders that arechoosing to engage in the policyarena, because they are not satisfied withworking at the margins of pressing issues.Instead, they have decided to invest in organizationsand strategies that can achieve significant results tostrengthen communities over the long term. Thesegrantmakers know that solutions for most major prob-lems must involve all sectors of society and ensure thatgovernment resources are used wisely and efficientlyfor the benefit of those most affected. And they believethat local communities have some of the best ideas andleadership capacity to make things better. As these reports show, civic participation and poli-cy engagement is a winning combination for founda-tions seeking the best possible results to achieve theirgoals. Key findings from the seven studies include:• 110 organizations in 13 states took in $231 millionfrom foundations and other donors and leveraged itto create $26.6 billion in benefits for communitiesand taxpayers, often helping some of the most mar-ginalized groups in society. That means every dollarthat grantmakers and other donors provided reaped$115 in community benefit. • The groups affected hundreds of policies on a broadrange of issues. Some efforts led to additional gov-ernment spending, some saved the governmentmoney and made its programs and services moreefficient and effective, and others actually helpedgenerate public revenue.• The most effective strategies and campaignsinvolved leadership and mobilization by under-served communities, effective coalitions, use of aRETURN ON INVESTMENT OF $115 TO $1Leveraging Limited Dollars HOW GRANTMAKERS ACHIEVE TANGIBLE RESULTS BY FUNDING POLICY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT1.

Civic engagement andleadership development had ripple effects in thebroader community.• At least 321 grantmakers, diverse in terms of typeand size, supported the work of one or more of theorganizations. In the aggregate they contributedmore than three of every four dollars spent on poli-cy engagement and grassroots organizing. WHEN GRANTMAKERS INVEST IN CIVIC AND POLICY ENGAGEMENT, THEY ACHIEVESIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE AND IMPACT. A growing number of grantmaking organizations arefunding nonprofit advocacy, community organizing andcivic engagement as ways to leverage their limited dol-lars. What do these terms really mean?2 Very simply,advocacy is when nonprofits promote a policy or ideaand encourage others to adopt it. Grantmakers fund avariety of activities that support advocacy, from researchto public education. There are no legal limits on howmuch non-lobbying advocacy nonprofits can undertake.Community organizing brings together residents, par-ents, youth, workers, faith leaders and/or other commu-nity members so they can collectively identify problems,develop solutions and engage with relevant decisionmakers to implement them. Civic engagement refersbroadly to all the ways community organizations helpresidents participate in public life, whether by voting,getting involved in their child’s school or mobilizingneighbors to improve community conditions. Using these three strategies, 110 organizations in13 states3 took in $231 million and leveraged it for$26.6 billion in benefits to communities and taxpayers,often helping some of the most marginalized groups insociety. These included children and youth, low-wageworkers, families living in poverty, people with disabil-ities, rural residents, immigrants, communities of color,lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning(LGBTQ) individuals and other underserved popula-tions. Yet, these impacts often benefited the broadercommunity beyond intended beneficiaries. For exam-ple, wage enhancing policies created an economicmultiplier effect for states and localities and a boost tolocal businesses. In every research site, whether urban or rural, thedata consistently showed a high return on investmentfor each dollar allocated to advocacy and organizing.Every dollar grantmakers and other donors provided toorganizations for these strategies reaped an average of$115 in community benefit.

The states were: Alabama, Arkansas,California (Los Angeles County only), Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon,Pennsylvania and Washington.In North Carolina, the A.J. FletcherFoundation, a supporting organization,became a major ally of housing advo-cates and the state Housing FinanceAgency in their goal to increase alloca-tions for the state’s housing trust fund.According to its own history on its website, the foundation “was originally aquiet, relatively unknown supporter ofopera performances and education, var-ious musical institutions and scholar-ships in area colleges until fairly recent-ly.” After its assets more than doubled, itexpanded its arts and culture grantmak-ing but also began to fund anti-povertyand social service organizations.  Fletcher provided a grant to theCampaign for Housing Carolina,enabling its leaders to add new andunlikely partners to the campaign,including AARP, the ARC and the stateBankers Association. The foundation’sprincipals, Barbara and Jim Goodmon,also gave the issue airtime on their tele-vision stations and promoted the causewith business leaders and state legisla-tors. They got a tremendous bang fortheir buck with this investment ofresources and time - 6,000 low-income,elderly and disabled households bene-fited from the increased housing funds,and the whole state benefited economi-cally. The economic ripple effect of$51.2 million in Housing Trust Fundexpenditures included a projected$232 million in new construction andrehab, created thousands of construc-tion jobs and generated $44 million instate and local tax revenues.6Grantmaker Spotlight3broadest benefit. These were campaigns that advocatesand organizers in multiple states undertook:• Raising the local or state minimum wage (eightstates).  • Increasing funding for public schools and for pre-kindergarten (nine states).• Spurring affordable housing development throughHousing Trust Funds (seven states).Sometimes, public spending was needed to imple-ment the policy wins documented in the studies, butoften advocates sought policies that would use publicfunds more efficiently and effectively. Many reformsdid not require government revenue, such as raisingthe minimum wage, which helped lift millions of work-ers’ standard of living with no negative impact on theeconomy. Still, other policy changes won by groups inthe study actually saved state governments money:embracing restorative justice policies that reducedprison costs; helping states avoid unfunded federalmandates such as REAL ID4; and implementingreforms to state programs. As one Pennsylvania serviceprovider and advocate said, “There is a cost savings tochanging a bad policy. We know what that cost is -give us a chance to tell you.”5 Finally, some policychanges helped generate new government revenue.Many policy gains documented in the studies willhave long-term benefits for specific populations andfor society at large, yet they cannot be easily mone-tized. Like the famous credit card advertisement, theserewards are “priceless.” Examples included: • Making environmental gains, especially to protectcommunities of color from facilities that pollute air and water. • Increasing access to health care and services fordomestic violence victims, mental health con-sumers, people with HIV/AIDS and other under-served populations. • Promoting LGBTQ rights, such as marriage equali-ty and anti-bullying protections. • Expanding immigrant rights, such as access tohigher education. The value of stronger civil and human rights to soci-ety is intangible, yet these policies address issues ofequity and fairness that are at the core of our democ-racy. No doubt, environmental and health benefitshave monetary values, but they are not often calculat-ed. If they could be monetized, the documented returnon investment of $115 to $1 would be even higher. Leveraging Limited Dollars4. The REAL ID Act of 2005 established new federal standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards.5. Julia Craig, Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities: Impacts of Advocacy, Organizing, and Civic Engagement inPennsylvania, National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, February 2011.6. This policy impact was reported in Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities: Impacts of Advocacy, Organizing, and CivicEngagement in North Carolina, by Lisa Ranghelli and Julia Craig, National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, May 2009.4Whether quantifiable or not, the changes won bynonprofit advocates were aimed largely at creating long-term solutions. For example, a number of communitiesin the study decided that homelessness will not endunless there is sufficient affordable housing. Theybelieved it was not enough to just keep supportinghomeless shelters. So they advocated for a dedicatedsource of revenue that would finance low-cost housingwithout burdening taxpayers. As in North Carolina (seesidebar on A.J. Fletcher Foundation, page 3), grantmak-ers that support advocates to establish housing trustfunds are leveraging their dollars to draw moreresources to the table. These funders are helping to makesystems more responsive over the longer term, and gen-erating broader community benefit through new tax rev-enue, job creation and neighborhood stabilization. SEVERAL KEY STRATEGIES CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO SUCCESS.The organizations featured in the studies used a rangeof strategies to achieve policy change, including leader-ship development, grassroots mobilization, constituentmeetings with legislators, research and policy develop-ment, raising awareness through public education,building coalitions and alliances, litigation, communi-cations and framing, traditional and social media, inte-grated voter engagement and movement building. Ourresearch suggests five observations that grantmakersshould keep in mind when funding this work. Thesefeatured practices recurred across sites as some of themost effective advocacy and organizing strategies andtypes of campaigns.1. Leadership by and mobilization of marginalizedcommunities is essential to success.  In an increasingly polarized atmosphere, and in apolitical terrain flooded with special interest money,the role that community groups play to engage ordi-nary citizens in public life cannot be overestimated.The effectiveness of constituents telling their own storydirectly to policy makers was a common best practiceacross research sites. Some of the people who broughttheir voice to legislators for the first time were peoplewith disabilities, mental health consumers and immi-grant youth. This strategy proved to be highly effective,especially when constituents were backed by hun-dreds and thousands of their fellow community mem-bers, mobilized for action. The sample nonprofits viewed civic engagement asboth a strategy to achieve policy change and a valuedoutcome in itself. In our study sites alone, at least700,000 residents – more than can fit in the sevenlargest football stadiums at once – were given theopportunity to voice their concerns publicly, and manymore were reached through newsletters, radio showsand other means of communication. The 44 nonprofitsthat reported voter engagement data registered moreNational Committee for Responsive Philanthropyattended public actions 702,468communicated with policy makers 528,880joined community organizations 448,909participated in leadership training 94,471became core leaders 16,282FIGURE 2: SUMMARY OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT FINDINGS OVER FIVE YEARSBROADEREngagementDEEPEREngagementthan 245,000 residents and reached 1.9 million votersthrough get-out-the-vote efforts.These numbers speak to the breadth of civic partici-pation, yet the depth of engagement also is noteworthy,as individual community members’ leadership potentialhas been activated. The study found broad communitybenefit from this kind of leadership development, asthose trained by an organization can go on to be leadersin other spheres and pass skills to their children.Marcelas Owens was only 10 years old when he becamea national spokesperson for health care reform in 2010,the third generation in his family to be trained as a leaderby the Washington Community Action Network.7 Whenfoundations invest in effective organizations that conductleadership development combined with advocacy ororganizing, their grant dollars continue to see benefit andimpact beyond the grant cycle, as the ripple effects ofcivic engagement spread throughout the community.Another way community groups effectively engagemarginalized communities is by combining direct serv-ices and advocacy or organizing. Some funders andnonprofits may view services and advocacy as either/orpropositions. In fact, directly serving constituent needsand advocating for systems change can go hand inhand. Increasingly, traditional service providers havedecided that they will never make meaningful progressin reducing individual need for their programs untilthey can address the larger systems. Their intimateknowledge of community problems and public servic-es makes them policy experts.82. Coalitions are needed to achieve statewide orsignificant policy reform. While some organizations in the study secured policychanges on their own, most significant impacts werewon by broad coalitions. Collaboration on policy cam-paigns can bring many benefits: a broad geographicbase of support; bridge building among diverse con-stituencies to create a united front; and a mix of skillsand capacities to use a variety of tactics (grassrootsmobilization, lobbying, research, communications,legal action, etc.). Coalitions that include cross-sectoralliances, for example, with labor unions or businessleaders, can leverage additional resources and cloutbeyond what nonprofits bring to the table. Fostering effective coalitions takes time, resourcesand leadership in order to build organic, trusting rela-tionships among participating organizations, establishcommon objectives, reach agreement on tactics androles, and determine how decisions will be made andconflicts resolved. According to Gladys Washington,program director at the Mary Reynolds BabcockFoundation, providing “glue” support for coalitions isessential. Taking time for the group process is importantin coalitions, “especially when you are marrying strict-ly policy organizations with local leadership.”10Funders can help level the playing field so that grass-5Leveraging Limited DollarsGrantmaker SpotlightThe Brindle Foundation in New Mexico is representativeof many funders in the study. It is concerned with thewell-being of children and youth, and funds in the areasof education, early childhood development, youth devel-opment and human services. According to NanSchwanfelder, president of this independent family foun-dation, “We got into advocacy as part of our early child-hood initiative in response to what we heard from ourgrantees, the people in community organizations direct-ly connected to babies and families. And they convincedus that investing in advocacy would mean more bang forour buck in expressing our shared passion, and in pro-moting the efforts to help those families prosper.”  Onegrantee, New Mexico Voices for Children, played a keyrole to dramatically expand access to the Children’sHealth Insurance Program and raise eligibility levels forchild care subsidies, ensuring that working families justabove the poverty level would have decent health careand child care in New Mexico.97.

Also, grantmakers can convenestakeholders, provide staff support to nascent efforts,and leverage relationships with donors. This conveningrole, while appreciated by nonprofits, needs to be takenon with awareness of the inherent power dynamics. 3. Applying a racial equity lens helps ensure thatprograms and policies address disparities. Many organizations in the study emphasized the impor-tance of applying an explicit understanding of racialequity. The Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equitydefines a racially equitable society as “one in which thedistribution of resources, opportunities and burdenswas not determined or predictable by race.”11 An often-overlooked reality is that typically institutions, policiesand programs are not designed or implemented toaddresses the needs of all intended beneficiaries in anequally effective way. As one Washington state advo-cate said, “There is a tendency to throw a big, wideblanket over poverty. But we know you don’t get awhite family out of poverty the same way you get a fam-ily of color out of poverty.”12An example of how an explicit racial equity framecan achieve results is the successful effort by theAlliance for Metropolitan Stability to help residentsorganize to save 600 homes in Brooklyn Park fromdemolition in 2004. This diverse suburb of the TwinCities, with 41 percent people of color, planned to teardown nearly 10 percent of its affordable housing stock.The coalition shone a light on the disproportionateeffect of the city’s plans on people of color, helping tomove racial disparities to the center of the community’sconsciousness. And it saved $84 million worth of hous-ing while ensuring one-for-one replacement of any low-cost housing demolished in the future.13Ways that nonprofits and grantmakers can apply aracial equity lens include: presenting data on racialdisparities; promoting policies to reduce disparities;developing leadership by communities of color andothers that experience disparities; and building rela-tionships among different communities affected bydisparities. Bringing issues of racial equity to the fore-front is not only a way to ensure that systems areresponsive to all residents’ needs; it also allowsunderserved communities to build broader coalitionsand alliances. The study found that intermediaryorganizations often play a vital role in building thecapacity of community groups and funders to incor-porate racial equity in their work. Cultural compe-tence is an important skill, and capacity buildingneeds to be culturally appropriate.6National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyThe Montana Community Foundationleadership saw many residents in thestate drowning in debt at the mercy ofunscrupulous lenders with interest ratesas high as 400 percent. The foundationdecided to invest some of the proceedsfrom an endowed fund into a ballotcampaign to curb abusive payday lend-ing practices. The foundation’s CEO,Linda Reed, explained, “The battle tooverturn Montana’s predatory lendinglaws began in 2003 and was fought bythe best low income and human rightsadvocates in the state to no avail; billsnever made it out of committee. Thefoundation, under the auspices of itsWomen’s Foundation, joined the causein 2009. But after that session weagreed that a legislative solution wasnot possible and the only solution wasto take the issue to the people througha ballot initiative.”  The foundation pro-vided both seed capital to launch theinitiative and staff to coordinate theactivities of the advocates. A broadcoalition formed to limit interest ratescharged by predatory lenders to 36percent. In November 2010, they suc-ceeded. Voters approved the measureoverwhelmingly, 72% - 28%.14Grantmaker Spotlight11.GrantCraft and Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity, Grantmaking with a Racial Equity Lens, 2007.12.Gita Gulati-Partee and Lisa Ranghelli, Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities: Impacts of Advocacy, Organizing, and CivicEngagement in the Northwest Region, National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, September 2010.13.Gita Gulati-Partee and Lisa Ranghelli, Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities: Impacts of Advocacy, Organizing, and CivicEngagement in Minnesota, National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, September 2009.14.Gita Gulati-Partee and Lisa Ranghelli, Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities: Impacts of Advocacy, Organizing, and CivicEngagement in the Northwest Region, National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, September 2010.74. Legal advocacy can have far-reaching effects,yet it is a tool underutilized by grantmakers. Successful legal action can have widespread impact,and it is often the only way to ensure that governmentand private institutions address community needs.Litigation is legal for private foundations to engage inand fund and is not considered lobbying, according tothe Alliance for Justice. Yet, nonprofits that use legaladvocacy strategies have a hard time finding grantmak-ers willing to support these efforts. Post-Katrina legal advocacy demonstrated dramati-cally how this strategy can achieve systemic changebenefiting underserved communities. The Greater NewOrleans Fair Housing Action Center sued the federalDepartment of Housing and Urban Development andLouisiana Recovery Authority because the Road Homeprogram formula for awarding grants to homeownersrelied on pre-storm house values in some instances,rather than the cost of rebuilding. White homeownersreceived, on average, $40,000 more than AfricanAmericans to rebuild comparable homes. HUDresponded to the lawsuit by disbursing more than $2billion in additional compensation, allowing AfricanAmerican communities to begin rebuilding and regen-erating economically. Legal advocacy can help states save money, as well.In 2007, Equal Justice Initiative obtained a ruling fromthe Alabama Supreme Court that ended mandatory lifewithout parole for nonviolent repeat offenders, savingthe state more than $113 million in future prison costs.15And state-level litigation can set precedents nation-ally. The Colonias Development Council and allies filedsuit after New Mexico officials ignored communityhealth concerns in approving a permit for what wouldhave been the fourth landfill in rural Chaparral. In a2005 landmark decision, the state Supreme Court over-turned lower court rulings to affirm the importance ofpublic input into the siting of landfills.16Like other kinds of advocacy, legal action can takeseveral years before a policy or program change isimplemented. Funders need to be in it for the long haul. 5. Electoral engagement complements otherstrategies for achieving change. Research across the country revealed that many com-munities get an added boost in effectiveness when theyadd electoral activities to their advocacy toolkit.Organizations have learned how to combine year-roundadvocacy and organizing with the more cyclical work ofnonpartisan voter engagement and candidate and votereducation. When done well, uniting these two kinds ofactivities can be mutually reinforcing and furtheradvance the organization’s mission.17 A brief recap oflegal rules demonstrates that grantmakers have flexibili-ty to support grantees to use a variety of electoral tools.18Leveraging Limited Dollars15.The New Orleans and Alabama legal actions are featured in Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities: Impacts of Advocacy,Organizing, and Civic Engagement in the Gulf/Midsouth Region.16.Lisa Ranghelli, Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities: Impacts of Advocacy, Organizing, and Civic Engagement in NewMexico, National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, December 2008.17.The Funders Committee for Civic Participation offers best practices for voter engagement. For example, see: http://funderscommittee.org/resource/fccp_report_integrated_voter_engagement_a_proven_model_to_increase_civic_engagement. 18.General support grants to 501c3 organizations can be used by grantees for non-partisan voter engagement activities, such as candidateeducation, public education, get-out-the vote and voter registration. There are special rules for funding that is specifically earmarked forvoter registration drives; see http://www.afj.org/assets/resources/nap/voter-registration-rules-FINAL.pdf.  Nonprofit 501c3s can alsowork on ballot initiatives (other than recalls), although the resources spent on ballot work must be counted toward their lobbying limits.Many states regulate ballot measure activity as well; see http://www.afj.org/for-nonprofits-foundations/state-law-resources.html. The statelaws generally pertain to disclosure, so the public can know whose money is being used in ballot measure campaigns. Redistricting activ-ities only count toward lobbying limits if the final redistricting plan is voted on in the state legislature (versus a commission or administra-tive body); this varies by state. The Alliance for Justice has fact sheets on each of these topics on its web site: http://www.afj.org/for-nonprofits-foundations/about-advocacy/Election-Activity.html.Rural Organizing Project leaders in Columbia County, Oregon, hand address11,000 postcards to voters to defeat anti-immigrant ballot measures inNovember 2008. Photo courtesy of Rural Organizing Project. One tool is to expand voter access. To address thelack of attention by policy makers to the concerns oflow-income women, Montana Women Vote decided toraise typically low turnout rates among this segment ofvoters. First, the group helped institute same-day voterregistration. Then, over two election cycles, MWV reg-istered more than 10,000 unlikely voters and achieveda 77 percent turnout rate. These numbers are signifi-cant in a state where legislative races often are won byfewer than 100 votes.20Another is to focus on redistricting. SouthernECHO’s longstanding work to increase minority par-ticipation in voting and the census, and to engageAfrican American communities in the redistrictingprocess, led to a gradual increase in the proportion oflegislators of color in the Mississippi state house.Subsequently, the Legislative Black Caucus effectivelyadvocated for community needs, such as overturninga gubernatorial veto of hundreds of millions in newpublic education dollars.21A strategy that works in combination with voterengagement is ballot campaigns, which are consideredlobbying activity by the IRS. In 2008, several LosAngeles groups helped defeat Proposition 6, a ballotinitiative that would have redirected almost $1 billionof education and human services funding for prisonand probation spending.22DIVERSE GRANTMAKERS ACHIEVE RESULTS BYFUNDING THESE STRATEGIES While many organizations raise additional revenuethrough membership dues, local fundraising andindividual donors, institutional philanthropy was byfar the single biggest source of advocacy and organ-izing support for the groups studied. Overall, morethan three of every four dollars spent on policyengagement and grassroots organizing (77 percent)came from foundations. At least 321 grantmakerssupported the work of one or more of the 110organizations in the research sample. These funderswere diverse in type, as shown in Graph 1, as wellas in grant dollars awarded, as the breakdown bytotal annual giving shows in Chart 1. Thirty-four per-cent had annual giving less than $1 million, 32 per-cent had giving between $1 million and $10 mil-lion, and 28 percent had annual giving greater than$10 million. These diverse grantmakers came to the decision tofund advocacy and organizing from many differententry points. Some are geographically focused andwant to improve their local communities. Others careabout a particular issue, such as access to education.And many are passionate about helping a specific pop-ulation, such as women and girls. Whatever the focusof each of these 321 funders, their leaders decided thatpolicy engagement was a tool that would help themachieve their mission.8National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyGrantmaker SpotlightElise Buik, CEO of United Way of Greater Los Angelesobserved, “Once we adopted ‘creating pathways out ofpoverty’ as our mantra, we saw we couldn’t fund ourway out of poverty. Focusing on real, long-term changemeant new strategies beyond grantmaking - research,convening, and mobilizing our various partners intonew alliances that advocate for policy reform. The pivotfor us was thinking long term, thinking change not justcharity, and thinking about putting our brand in serviceof big scale change.

To make a bigger difference, should your founda-tion consider the tools of policy and civic engage-ment? There are a handful of important steps grant-makers can take in order to get ready to make theirfirst advocacy grant.• Make the decision to do it. Have a board and staffdiscussion to explore how these strategies couldhelp you better achieve your mission. It may help toidentify one or two board members who are alreadyfamiliar with these strategies and can help facilitateconversation with other members. The foundationboard may want to take some of the other actionson this list, such as getting a handle on the legalrules and going on site visits, before it is ready tomake a decision.• Brush up on the legal rules governing advocacygrantmaking. The Alliance for Justice has excellentlegal and how-to guides, workshops and a team oflawyers who can answer your questions. If yourfoundation’s lawyer suggests you can’t make advo-cacy grants, help him/her understand the law andwhat can be done. Luz Vega-Marquis, CEO of theMarguerite Casey Foundation, says she asks thefoundation’s attorneys to tell her what she can do,not what she can’t do. Often foundation lawyers justdon’t know these rules well. Also work with yourlawyer to develop non-restrictive grant agreementsthat do not needlessly or inadvertently prohibitallowable activities.23• Familiarize yourself with the advocacy landscape.NCRP has a bibliography on advocacy and organizingfor grantmakers that can orient you to relevantresources, tools, affinity groups and advocacy andorganizing infrastructure groups. Talk to other grant-makers that already use these strategies and that matchyour foundation type, mission, issue focus or geo-9Leveraging Limited Dollars23.The Alliance for Justice has several resources on grant agreements at: http://www.afj.org/for-nonprofits-foundations/about-advocacy/funding-advocacy.html. Another resource is the advocacy toolkit produced by Center for Lobbying in the Public Interest andthe Council on Foundations: http://www.clpi.org/images/pdf/pressroom/pf_toolkit_complete.pdf. It summarizes the rules for fundingadvocacy and provides sample grant agreement language. They have also produced a similar toolkit for community foundations.

Ask them to introduceyou to successful organizations and accompany themon visits with their advocacy grantees.• Help applicants and grantees assess advocacycapacity. Once you have decided to make advoca-cy grants and you know the legal parameters, takea look at some of the tools that can help you deter-mine whether your potential advocacy granteeshave the capacity to advocate or organize. If someof them are not ready yet, you can explore optionsfor building their capacity. The Alliance for Justiceand TCC Group have developed capacity assess-ment tools.25Other advocacy funding best practicesOur studies showed that a funder’s approach to thegrants process itself can make a big difference in howeffectively its dollars are leveraged for policy impact.The research suggests that funders should:• Provide core support and multiyear funding, themost useful types of grants for advocacy activities.General or core support is the most legally flexibletype, and it allows grantees to be responsive touncertain policy environments and new windows ofopportunity.  Multiyear funding helps groups tacklelong-term systems change and ensure that policiesare implemented.  • Minimize application and reporting burdens so thatgrantees can devote their time and resources toimproving policies and programs rather than drown-ing in paperwork.26• Treat nonprofit grantees as true partners by promot-ing honest dialogue, mutual respect and collabora-tion toward common goals.• Work with grantees to develop appropriate quan-titative and/or qualitative evaluation tools thatare useful to both the nonprofit and the grant-maker. Because policy change rarely happens inone grant cycle, capturing the interim benchmarksand capacity that nonprofits achieve on the path topolicy change, even when there are setbacks, isimportant.27• Offer capacity building support that is culturallyappropriate and specific to the needs identified bythe grantee. Latonya Slack of the James IrvineFoundation, which was praised by grantees for itsresponsiveness in this area, noted, “Advocacyorganizations needs to be responsive and agile, andcapacity building can help them to reach that goal.”For example, Irvine provided tailored executivedirector leadership training to one grantee, and pro-vided strategic planning and communications assis-tance to another. • Identify ways to help advocates beyond thegrant, for example by convening stakeholders,leveraging access to media and policy makers,conducting outreach to other funders on theirbehalf and providing research and testimonials onthe relevant issue. CONCLUSIONThe seven studies conducted by NCRP demonstratebeyond a shadow of a doubt that foundation fundingfor advocacy and civic engagement results in substan-tial, tangible benefits for families and communitiesacross the nation. These strategies enable nonprofitsand grantmakers to tackle complex social and econom-ic challenges and improve millions of lives in under-served communities. For grantmakers seeking to lever-age their limited grant dollars for greater results, espe-cially during difficult times, policy engagement offersthe opportunity to do just that.NCRP is available as a resource to help foundationsembark on this path to greater impact.

We pro-mote philanthropy that serves the public good, is responsive to people and communities withthe least wealth and opportunity, and is held accountable to the highest standards of integri-ty and openness.NCRP’s Criteria for Philanthropy at Its Best, published in March 2009, challenges grant-makers to promote the American values of opportunity and inclusion by contributing to astrong, participatory democracy that engages all communities. One way funders can accom-plish that is by providing at least 25 percent of their grant dollars for policy advocacy, com-munity organizing and civic engagement. This aspirational goal is one of ten benchmarks inCriteria.Many grantmakers invest in advocacy, organizing and civic engagement as a way toadvance their missions and strengthen communities. A sizable number of foundations,however, have not seriously considered investing in these strategies, partly because theyhave difficulty measuring impact and fully understanding how effective these strategiescan be. The Grantmaking for Community Impact Project (GCIP) addresses these concernsby highlighting the positive impact that communities have seen through funder-support-ed nonpartisan advocacy and organizing.To provide foundations with useful information that can help them consider supportingthese strategies at higher levels, each GCIP report documents impact and demonstrates howadvocacy, community organizing and civic engagement result in community-wide benefitsand can advance a foundation’s mission. This report distills findings from the first sevenreports in the GCIP series.Additional information is available online at www.ncrp.org/gcip. ",
