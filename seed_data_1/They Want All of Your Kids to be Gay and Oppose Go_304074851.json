News reports, in which \nincivility continues to run rampant. Utilizing critical discourse analysis, this study \naddresses incivility and \"othering\" in Yahoo! News article comment sections from news \nreporting on LGBTQ-related stories. From a sample of 1000 Yahoo! News comments \nusing open coding, several themes are clear in five news reports from this year. Human \nrights, perversion, and gender are each themes in comments, many of which perpetuate \nhomophobia and heteronormativity, and promote incivility. I conclude Yahoo! News \ncomments are ultimately ineffective and do not support civil, thoughtful discussion. \nKeywords: LGBTQ, civility, othering, Yahoo!, gender, critical discourse analysis \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO!

NEWS COMMENTS 7 \n\"They Want All of Your Kids to be Gay and Oppose God\": \nIncivility and Othering in Yahoo! News Comments \nHow does the United States of America, a country which glorifies terms such as \n\"equality\" and \"freedom,\" blatantly and legally discriminate against LGBTQ (lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, queer) people? This question has long puzzled me, and fueled \na desire to research homophobia. I am uncertain when exactly my interest in this \nresearch area was ignited, but looking back on my life, a series of events stand out as \npivotal in my curiosity. I remember small things from year to year, like whispered \nplayground rumors about someone being gay, a boy being made fun of for wearing a pink \nshirt, and someone telling my friend and I not to hold hands because we are \"both girls.\" \nHowever, the incident that stands out most vividly (probably because it seemed like such \na personal attack at the time) in my mind happened when I was in middle school. I very \nclearly remember several boys yelling \"dyke\" at me because I won knockout (a \nbasketball game) during gym class. Why was I a \"dyke\" because I could beat the boys at \nbasketball? These incidents led me to start asking questions about sexuality and gender. \nI may not have known it at the time, but these questions would evolve and follow me into \ngraduate school and fuel my research. I wanted to understand how homophobia, \nheteronormativity, and sexism could become such a legitimized and accepted part of our \nsociety. \nHowever, I was at first unsure of how and where I would find data to study \nhomophobic discourse. This uncertainty ultimately led me to Yahoo! News. I find \nmyself drawn to online news comments, particularly Yahoo! News comments. Yahoo! \nNews was the homepage of the first computer I ever owned, and at some point in time, I \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 8 \ndiscovered the comments section. From my experience, these comments are terrible, and \nfilled with hate and flawed logic. I was drawn to these comments, as the saying goes, \nlike a train wreck-it was awful, but I couldn't look away; I couldn't stop reading. So, \nnaturally, I became interested in studying homophobic comments, which ultimately lead \nto the creation of this study. At the time I was preparing the prospectus defense for this \nresearch study, Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-fil-A had, in fact, just won an equality award. \nDan Cathy had previously come to my attention when responding \"guilty as charged\" \nwhen prompted if he was against \"gay marriage\" (Stampler, 2014, para. 4). Furthermore, \nprofits from Cathy's restaurant, Chick-fil-A have often funded \"anti-gay\" groups \n(Reports, 2012). The Community Empowerment Award, awarded by The Urban League \nof Greater Atlanta, was given to Cathy despite his stance on LGBTQ equality (Ellis, \n2013). I have always been outraged by the blatant discrimination against the LGBTQ \ncommunity, but after reading about Cathy's recent award, the night before my defense, I \nfound my energy to research this topic renewed. What fuels this discrimination? How \ncan someone who unashamedly opposes LGBTQ equality win an equality award? I was \nutterly disgusted and troubled by the very flawed logic that led to this award. By \nanalyzing, in depth, uncivil internet discourse targeted at the LGBTQ community, I hope \nto create a better understanding of the ideologies and power which fuel homophobia, \nheteronormativity, and other ideologies which may have contributed to the logic which \nultimately allowed Cathy to win an equality award. \nMore generally, sexuality has been the focus of academic research for decades. \nFoucault (1990) states: \"if sexuality was constituted as an area of investigation, this was \nonly because relations of power had established it as a possible object\" (p. 98). In this \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 9 \nquote, Foucault comments on the influence of the powerful in deciding what constitutes \nan area of inquiry, as well as the definitions of populations. Sexuality has become a \ncategorization of populations-the LGBTQ community-as well as an important area of \ninquiry because it has been defined as such by those in power. The focus on sexuality as \nan \"issue\" to be discussed publicly may be partially fueled by its prevalence in the media, \nparticularly regarding same-sex marriage in the United States. Scholars, activists, and \nonline commenters in discussion boards each discuss sexuality to various degrees, though \neach group discusses the topic in very different ways. Policies regulating marriage in the \nUnited States are changing, which is a sign of progress, but public discourse surrounding \nthe LGBTQ community continues to perpetuate incivility and hate. For example, on \nNovermber 5, 2013, the Illinois House of Representatives vote on marriage equality \npassed (Davey & Yaccino, 2013). Furthermore, the Editorial Board (2014) of the New \nYork Times reports in addition to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) having been \nstruck down in 2013, there is currently an \"explosion of new lawsuits in more than 30 \nstates\" which challenges current discriminatory marriage laws. Discussion of the \nLGBTQ community is prominent in political discourse, but an unfiltered, unmoderated \ndiscourse exists online in the form of anonymous internet comments. In this analysis, I \ninvestigate internet comments which respond to Yahoo! News articles about LGBTQ \nissues and analyze this internet discourse while considering civility and \"othering\" \nthrough critical discourse analysis. I am especially interested in how internet comments \nimplicate gender norms, as well as perpetuate misconceptions and incivility. \nThe association between gender and sexuality is certainly a fascinating one. \nSedgwick (1990) and Wilchins (2004) discuss at length the socially constructed \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS \nconnections between gender and sexuality, starting with the early women's rights \nmovements. Wilchins (2004) writes of women's rights and the feminist movement: \n10 \n\"America had no interest in tearing down traditional gender roles\" (p. 8). According to \nKnobloch-Westerwick and Hoplamazian (2012), traditional gender role expectations and \n\"attitudes may be among the most influential ones for our perceptions and behavior\" (p. \n358). Gender conformity expectations have a huge influence on human behavior. Much \nonline discourse perpetuating oppressive and restrictive gender ideologies and hate \nclearly shows the disinterest or perhaps blatant ignorance of breaking down gender roles. \nFor example, gay or lesbian parents are often criticized or discriminated against because \nmany believe children should be raised with both a father and a mother, a theme which \ncomes up quite often in my analysis, suggesting both a mother and father figure (a male \nand female) are necessary to properly raise and care for a child. This also suggests men \nand women must bring different parenting roles and strategies to the table, if two women \nor two men could not also raise well-adjusted children. \nGender roles are still a talking point in the struggle for equal LGBTQ rights \ntoday. Jagose (1996) points out early gay liberation activists believed \"gay liberation \nwould be secured only after sex and gender categories had been eradicated\" (p. 59). This \nis exemplified by the tendency for many people to conflate gender norm violations with \nsexual orientation. For example, the common use of the term \"gaydar\", which is the \nassumption sexual orientation can be distinguished by behavior, suggests a belief the \nperformance of gender can be an indicator of sexual orientation (Stern, West, Jost, & \nRule, 2013). Until gender performance and sexual orientation are no longer viewed as \nco-constituting, hegemonic gender role expectations will continue to be an issue for \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 11 \nLGBTQ activists and scholars. In fact, many examples of uncivil comments regarding \nthe LGBTQ community stem from sexism, as I will explore in my analysis. Wilchins \n(2004) states many feminist groups were accused of \"advancing the homosexual agenda\" \nbecause they were \"being run by lesbians\" (p. 9). \"Such attacks were not against \nhomosexuality per se-whom feminists slept with and what they did in bed weren't an \nissue. On the contrary, the attacks were intended to play directly on the public's fears \nabout male and female roles\" (Wilchins, 2004, p. 10). The gay rights movement and the \nfeminist movement both deal with issues of gender. Therefore, in this research study, I \nalso look at how online comments perpetuate oppressive gender ideologies, particularly \nrelated to incivility and enforcement of gender roles. \nThrough this analysis, I explore themes in online discourse relating to \nhomophobia, including human rights, perversion and gender, while also exploring \ninstances of incivility and \"othering\". In this analysis, I analyze online discourse through \na sample of 1000 comments from various Yahoo! News stories which report on issues \nrelated to the LGBTQ community. However, before getting into an analysis of online \ncomments, I first consider the existing research relevant to this research study. I discuss \nprevious research on online comments, particularly anonymous posts, civility and \ndiscourse, \"othering,\" and critical discourse analysis. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 12 \nLiterature Review/Conceptual Framework \nIn order to analyze online discourse, I use research on incivility and \"othering\", \nwhile simultaneously conducting a critical discourse analysis. In order to thoroughly \ncomplete this analysis, I must first consider the existing research on incivility, \nparticularly relating to online communication, as well as \"othering\" and critical discourse \nanalysis. I look to existing research in order to add to the scholarly conversation about \ncivility, the \"other,\" and critical discourse analysis. I look to how the existing research \nregarding civility and online communication, as well as \"othering\" and critical discourse \nanalysis, intersect in a way useful to my own research, particularly focusing on online \ncomments and anonymity. \nOnline Comments and Anonymity \nBenson (2011) states \"civility as a behavior is fundamentally about \ncommunication\" (p. 23). Instances of incivility in internet discourse make for a \npotentially fascinating communication study, particularly when analyzed critically. \nBenson goes on to describe expectations of civility as a type of code of conduct which \n\"governs the way we talk and the meaning we attribute to our actions and those of others\" \n(p. 23). Therefore, when incivility occurs, when the rules of civility are broken, the \ncommunication process experiences something of a norm violation. What makes the \nstudy of incivility in online discourse even more fascinating (and problematic) is when \nincivility works to further marginalize already marginalized groups. However, that is not \nto say incivility cannot be, at times, justifiable. As Foucault (1990) discusses the \npowerful as deciding what constitutes an area of inquiry, so too do the powerful often \ndefine what constitutes incivility. Therefore, those commenters who further marginalize \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 13 \nwith uncivil comments are perpetuating oppressive power inequalities. On the other \nhand, those who may impolitely, and perhaps uncivilly demand equality, though uncivil, \nmay be justified. For this reason, I want to explore incivility in online comments which \n\"other\" LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) individuals. Drawing on \nHall (1997) Krumer-Nevo and Sidi (2012) state the \"other\" can refer to anybody, yet \n\"othering\" most often occurs against marginalized groups. In this analysis, using \nresearch on incivility, \"othering,\" and critical discourse analysis, I analyze online \ndiscursive representations ofLGBTQ individuals in Yahoo! comments. First, however, I \nconsider the literature regarding online discussions and computer mediated \ncommunication (CMC) and anonymous or semi-anonymous commenting. Next, I \nexplore the conceptual framework which I utilize throughout this research study: civility \nand discourse, \"othering\", and critical discourse analysis (CDA). \nThe introduction of comments sections to online news articles changed the way \naudiences interact with the news. Reader (2012) describes this change: \nTraditional feedback forums were heavily managed---editors selected letters to \nthe editor to publish, and often edited those selections for length or grammar. As \nsuch, published letters to the editor became products of journalistic gatekeeping, \nand the resulting forums often were more reflective of what journalists wanted \nthan of what the writing public desired (p. 1). \nHowever, more recently, public responses to news articles became much less edited. For \nexample, in 2004, many newspapers in the U.S. allowed public commenting on news \narticles posted to their websites (Hughey & Daniels, 2013). However Hughey and \nDaniels (2013) state, since then, many U.S. news websites have removed public comment \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 14 \nboards, ceased archiving public comments, or turned to moderators to edit or delete \nhateful or overly aggressive comments. Yet, though many news outlets now edit or have \nremoved public comments, other news outlets, such as Yahoo! News, continue to allow \nunedited comments without moderation. As Reader (2012) and Santana (2011) point out, \nmany news reporters and journalists do not find online comments on the news useful to a \ncivil conversation. While this more unedited version of public commentary may function \nto give a voice to the public, simultaneously the quality of those comments comes into \nquestion, particularly regarding online anonymity. \nScott (2004) defines anonymity as \"the condition in which a message source is \nabsent or largely unknown to a message recipient\" (p. 128). Furthermore, Scott also \npoints out a large portion of online communication is anonymous in nature. However, \nScott also mentions a source can be partially identified. He points out online anonymity \nis distinctive because an internet-user may perceive himself or herself to be posting \nanonymously, though unknowingly provide identifying information. Rather than creating \na dichotomized concept of identified or anonymous, Scott writes, \"anonymity must be \nconsidered to exist along a continuum from fully anonymous to fully identified\" (p. 129). \nCurrent research paints online comments, particularly anonymous online comments as \nproblematic, yet also essential to public discussion. Scott (2004) also states, \"the ability \nto communicate anonymously is viewed as part of our basic right to free speech ... but \nincreasingly problematized by new communication technologies\" (p. 127). Some \nscholars (Laineste, 2013; Reader, 2012; Scott, 2004), as well as the National \nCommunication Association credo (1999) point to the anonymous nature of online \ninteractions as an issue regarding social responsibility for what is said due to a lack of \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS \naccountability. Regardless of the part anonymity plays in the incivility of internet \ndiscourse, the scholarly research on online commenting generally describes online \naggression as quite common. For example, Laineste (2013) writes \"the generally \naggressive comments condemn the subculture of gays\" (p. 37), an observation \nparticularly relevant to this current study, and one I elaborate on later. \n15 \nMany scholars suggest establishing or increasing the number of online moderators \nas a possible solution to online incivility and bigotry (Haugh, 2010). However, as \nHughey and Daniels (2013) write, this solution is not problem-free. First and foremost, \nmoderators are not free. Reader (2012) conducted a study which found many internet \nusers believed online forums, discussion boards, or comments sections should be \nmoderated \"by those who participate in the forums, not staff or news media\" (pp. 8-9). \nWhile this approach could cut down costs of moderation, it does not completely solve \nmany of Hughey and Daniels' (2013) other issues with moderators. They also point out, \nregarding the removal of racist comments, moderation can \"represent a challenge for \npotential discourse analysis because they construct an ideal image of participation in the \npublic sphere that hides the racism that frequently emerges\" (p. 336). Furthermore, \nHughey and Daniels (2013) also indicate moderators may miss some offensive or hate-\nfilled messages, particularly those which are coded or difficult to recognize as offensive. \nRather than abandoning or moderating forums or comments sections, they suggest \nconfronting the issue in some manner. They write: \nModeration is itself a reactionary tactic predicated on dominant understandings of \nracism. Rather than engendering a focus on interfacing with racist discourse in a \nmeaningful way, these news sites simply attempt to ban the problem, frame the \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 16 \noffenders as rogue commenters, and then bury their head in the sand-hoping not \nto encounter more racism ... Moderation does not address racism, but rather hides \nit (pp. 343-344). \nAs evidenced in the above quote, not only is the LGBTQ community targeted in online \ndiscourse, but racist comments are also prevalent, suggesting a very general lack of \ncivility in online discourse. Although moderation would certainly result in the removal \nof hateful, bigoted, or generally uncivil comments, and thus decrease the perpetuation of \nthese tremendously harmful ideas online, this alone would not address the problem. As \nHughey and Daniels (2013) point out, this study would not be possible if moderators \nwere used in online commentary on Yahoo! News. However, because hateful online \nmessages do exist and are readily available, I take this opportunity, as Hughey and \nDaniels (2013) suggest, to address these issues and the ideologies and misconceptions \nbehind them. \nCivility and Discourse \nIn this study, I am concerned with incivility in online comments and how uncivil \ncomments may function to further marginalize oppressed groups targeted by these \ncomments. Similarly, I am concerned with the kinds of dominant ideologies reproduced \nand perpetuated through incivility online. Arnett (2001) points out \"a civil society offers \na common space for diverse standpoints\" (p. 327). While online comments often provide \nspace for diverse opinions, in a series of civility studies, two-thirds of respondents in \n2011, and 63 percent ofrespondents in 2012 indicated they believed the \"U.S. has a \nmajor civility problem\" (Lane & McCourt, 2013, p. 24). Furthermore, 55 percent stated \nthey expect civility problems in America to get worse. Clearly incivility is an issue in \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS \ngeneral, and when paired with anonymous posting and politics, becomes particularly \ninteresting for evaluation. Incivility in internet discourse often unveils dominant \nideologies and assumptions, as well as sheds light on prejudice. \n17 \nCurrently, LGBTQ individuals are discriminated against legally in the United \nStates (and throughout the world, for that matter) through marriage laws, discriminatory \norganizational policies, and unequally applied laws. Despite recent steps towards \nequality, such as public discussions and passages of marriage equality laws in certain \nparts of the United States, online discourse in internet comments remains hateful and \ndiscriminatory, backing up legal discrimination and even expressing clear outrage and \nhate. Incivility runs rampant in many internet comments, which is both fascinating and \nterrifying, and also extremely relevant to my discussion of online discourse relating to \nLGBTQ issues and exposed gender and sexuality ideologies. \nEthics, politeness, norms or social rules/social order are all keywords used, to \ndescribe civility (Lane & McCourt, 2013). Lane and McCourt (2013) point out it is \nimportant to consider both politeness and ethics in a discussion of civility. A speaker \nmay be polite yet unethical at the same time, as Lane and McCourt (2013) show in their \nexample of the Nazi who politely asks a prisoner to step into a gas chamber to their death. \nInternet hate speech, therefore, would certainly fall into the category of incivility, as it is \nneither polite nor ethical. However, Benson (2011) points out civility must also be \njudged based on the circumstances. Context becomes important when considering \nwhether comments are intentionally rude for purpose of \"flaming\". \"Flaming\" is defined \nby Laineste (2013) as \"online verbal aggression\" (p. 31), though Johnson, Cooper, and \nChin (2008) go into more detail, defining \"flaming\" as \"the antinormative hostile \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 18 \ncommunication of emotions ... that includes the use of profanity, insults, and other \noffensive or hurtful statements\" (2008, p. 419). \"Flaming\" occurs for a variety of \nreasons, depending on the user. Laineste (2013) points to the anonymous nature of online \ncommenting as the main factor contributing to online displays of aggression. However, \nsome internet users utilize \"flaming\" on internet discussion boards to intentionally get a \nrise out of other posters by writing controversial or offensive statements (Santana, 2011 ). \nMoreover, restraint and responsibility are important aspects of civility (Lane & McCourt, \n2013), meaning the use of \"flaming\" would certainly represent incivility. It is important \nto be reflexive and not simply express our first, unfiltered thoughts. Lane and McCourt \n(2013), therefore, suggest civility means finding a balance between self-expression and \nsocial responsibility. However, as will be made evident through my analysis, the \nintersection of social responsibility and self-expression remain elusive in online comment \nboards. \nIn addition to online instances of incivility, incivility in politics is a common \ntheme in civility research. An example of incivility in political discourse can be seen \nthrough looking at the discourse involved in the January 8, 2011 shooting in Tucson \nwhich claimed the lives of 6 people as well as critically injuring Representative Gabrielle \nGiffords (Peters & Stelter, 2011). Before the 2011 shootings in Tucson, Arizona, \"news \nreports called attention to a threatening rhetorical atmosphere ... with politicians-mostly \nRepublicans-evoking descriptions of 'Second Amendment solutions' should an election \nnot go as hoped\" (Benson, 2011, p. 24). News reports, which called attention to the \ndiscursive incivility by the Right as a contribution to the Tucson shooting, suggested very \nreal consequences to incivility. One such news report by Peters and Stelter (2011) draws \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 19 \nspecific attention to uncivil discourse from politicians directly, and the conclusions made \nby anonymous internet posters. The authors describe that some liberals accused \nconservatives of perpetuating incivility which they suggested contributed to violence, \nultimately suggesting a cause-effect relationship between political incivility and the \nshooting1. Furthermore, Sobieraj and Berry (2011) point out the use of outrage as a form \nof incivility in politics, such as mockery, misrepresentative exaggeration, insulting \nlanguage, and name-calling. This use of outrage was also paralleled in Peters and \nStelter' s (2011) news article. They state \"commentators on the right were quick to \ncondemn their perennial adversaries, including The New York Times, for drawing a cause-\nand-effect relationship between overheated political rhetoric and the shootings\" (para. \n14), when no such relationship truly existed. Therefore, news sources which quickly \nsuggested a cause-effect relationship between discursive incivility and the shooting \nwhere, themselves, creating an uncivil environment by jumping to false conclusions \nabout the shooter's motives. Though Peter and Stelter's news story and Benson's (2011) \nand Sobieraj and Berry's (2011) articles focus primarily on civility in political discourse, \narticles discussing LGBTQ issues are often political in nature, and the online commenters \nwho post under these articles often bring politics into the discussion, which I discuss \nmore fully in my analysis. Sobieraj and Berry (2011) also point out that outrage as a \nform of incivility comes from both conservative and liberal internet commenters, \nhowever the authors further state \"liberal content is quite nasty in character, following the \noutrage model with emotional, dramatic, and judgment-laden speech. Conservatives, \n1 Despite accusations of a uncivil discursive environment leading up to the Tucson shootings, the shooter, \nJared Lee Loughner, suffered from mental illness and had other motives. Although many news sources \nsuggested a link between discursive incivility and the shooting, Loughner's motives were not an effect of \ndiscursive incivility. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 20 \nhowever, are even nastier\" (p. 30). This becomes important due to the polarized views of \nconservatives versus liberals regarding LGBTQ issues. For example, in the recent \nIllinois House of Representatives vote on marriage equality, which passed November 5, \n2013, 61 representatives voted to pass the bill, with only 3 Republicans voting yes \n(Davey & Yaccino, 2013). Furthermore, the rhetoric of incivility can be applied to \ninternet rhetoric much the same as in political discourse, regardless of the political \naffiliations, or lack thereof, of those contributing to internet comment discourse. \nMoreover, the tendency for internet users to gain courage through the shield of \nhiding behind a computer screen and the anonymous nature of online posting has many \nimplications for civility. Hlavach and Freivogel (2011) suggest \"readers may be so \nwilling to speculate because they can post their thoughts anonymously\" (p. 24). They \nalso point out the anonymous comments provide speculation and misinformation which \ncould never, ethically, be reported in the original reported story in the newspaper. As \nLane and McCourt (2013) point out, ethics are an important consideration of civility, and \ntherefore many internet comments on news stories fail to remain civil conversations due \nto unethical discourse. However, online comments are not only unethical in a factual \nsense, but are also often hateful, bigoted, and contain problematic morality assumptions. \nAccording to Santana's (2011) article which discusses online reporters' perceptions of \nthe usefulness, or lack thereof, of internet discussion boards, 64.8 percent of reporters did \nnot believe online comments were conducive of \"civil, thoughtful discussion\" (p. 75). \nThe usefulness of online comments and discussion boards for news stories, then, is \nquestionable. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 21 \nAs Benson (2011) points out in his article, incivility is a common occurrence in \nU.S. political rhetoric, with sometimes violent implications. Benson (2011) states, \n\"incivility is itself a tactic in political discourse, employed as an indicator of sincerity, as \na marker of high stakes disagreement\" (p. 27). Therefore, with incivility being a popular \ndiscursive tool in political discourse, incivility via an online medium with anonymous \nposting, unsurprisingly, takes an even more vicious turn. Anonymous online comments \noften blend opinion and speculation (Hlavach & Freivogel, 2011), which becomes a \nspiraling mess of misinformation, prejudice, and distorted conclusions. Hlavach and \nFreivogel (2011) state: \nWhen a news organization sincerely invites a reader to comment, it can establish a \npersonal relationship with that reader; it can treat that reader as a valuable \nindividual whose opinion and input matters. The reader who feels valued is more \nlikely to contribute comments that can build ... 'social harmony'. However, if a \nnews organization allows comments to degenerate into a discourteous, \ndisrespectful digital diatribe, astute readers will avoid participation (p. 29). \nTherefore, the presence of incivility in news articles not only creates ethical implications, \nbut also fosters more hate while repelling well thought out, insightful comments. \nMoreover, Santana (2011) quotes a reporter as stating, \"Comments often quickly turn to \nracist, bigoted, inarticulate diatribes related to the story's subject matter only tangentially \nat best\" (p. 80). Regardless of the subject matter of the original news article, incivility in \ncomments is common. Furthermore, the tendency for political rhetoric to sway towards \nincivility, as pointed out by Benson (2011) and Sobieraj and Berry (2011) further \nexemplifies how incivility has become not only common, but becomes important when \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 22 \nconsidering how every aspect of life, from sexual orientation to gender identity becomes \npoliticized through laws regulating marriage, for example, to widely accepted gender \nideologies. \nOnline civility and rhetorical threats will certainly come into play in my analysis \nof online internet comments regarding LGBTQ news stories. Hlavach and Freivogel \n(2011) question the ethics of soliciting user comments for all news articles due to the \nwidespread incivility in anonymous comments. Furthermore, Hlavach and Freivogel \n(2011) suggest comments should only be made anonymous \"for a just cause\" (p. 34), \nsuggesting users take accountability and own their comments, which may lean towards \nmore thoughtful and civil discussions. This discussion of ethics in communication is also \nmirrored in the NCA (National Communication Association, 1999) credo for ethical \ncommunication, which endorses freedom of expression, but also condemns \n\"communication that degrades individuals and humanity through distortion, intimidation, \nand violence, and through the expression of intolerance and hatred.\" Furthermore, the \nNCA credo emphasizes accepting any consequences for communication at the individual \nlevel. Therefore, the NCA is emphasizing the importance of ethical and civil \ncommunication, as well as emphasizing the importance of taking responsibility for the \ncommunication in which individuals engage. Anonymous, uncivil internet comments in \nno way foster a positive communication climate, and therefore anonymity in comments \ncan be harmful to positive discourse. Though incivility is obviously something that \nshould be minimized, Benson (2011) states \"incivility will always be with us, and in our \ncontemporary media culture we're going to know about it\" (p. 29). However, by \nstudying and drawing attention to incivility and its implications, perhaps it can be \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS \nminimized, or at the very least, better understood. Furthermore, drawing attention to \nonline incivility could function as a call for better moderation in internet comments. In \nthe next section, I discuss \"othering\" of marginalized groups, and particularly LGBTQ \nindividuals. \n\"Othering\" \n23 \nIn this section, I discuss the \"othering\" of marginalized people, specifically \ndiscussing how LGBTQ individuals are \"othered\" through discourses of human rights, \nperversion, and gender. First, however, I provide broad overview of the existing \nscholarly discussions related to \"othering.\" Drawing on Hall (1997), Krumer-Nevo and \nSidi (2012) define \"othering\" as \"the process of attaching moral codes and inferiority to \ndifference\" (p. 300). The incivility expressed by many online commenters functions to \nsignify difference between LGBTQ individuals and the majority, effectively creating a \nheterosexual and \"others\" dichotomy. Hall (1997) points out that through representing \ndifference as negative, or labeling a group as inherently different, the majority group \nfunctions to \"other\" those who differ from the majority, whether that be a different race, \ngender, nationality, sexual orientation, or anything else. The \"majority\" category, such as \nmen, whiteness, heterosexuals, etc., is then rendered invisible. For example, discussions \nof race tend not to be about whiteness, while discussions of gender tend to focus on \nwomen. Likewise, discussions of \"sexuality\" tend on \"other\" sexual orientations, but not \nheterosexuality. Through problematic uses of incivility in internet discourse, many \ncommenters effectively \"other\" LGBTQ individuals, as I discuss below in my analysis. \nHall, Held, Hubert and Thompson (1996) describe \"the relations between men and \nwomen, the problem of sexual deviance, the question of family and other relationships, \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 24 \nthe relations between adults and children, and the issue of difference\" (p. 375) as \nrecurrent discussions which often come up when discussing sexuality in particular. \nThese themes in discussions of sexuality also come into play in the online discussions I \nconsider in the analysis portion of this study. Each of these themes ties to normalization \nof heterosexuality, which emphasizes difference, creating misconceptions and hate \ntowards LGBTQ individuals. \n\"Othering\" leads to the normalization of majority groups, which in the case of \nsexual orientation, creates heteronormativity. Berlant and Warner (1998) describe \nheteronormativity as: \nThe institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make \nheterosexuality seem not only coherent-that is, organized as a sexuality-but \nalso privileged. Its coherence is always provisional, and its privilege can take \nseveral (sometimes contradictory) forms: unmarked, as the basic idiom of the \npersonal and the social; or marked as a natural state; or projected as an ideal or \nmoral accomplishment. It consists less of norms that could be summarized as a \nbody of doctrine than of a sense of rightness produced in the contradictory \nmanifestations--often unconscious, immanent to practice or to institutions. \nContexts that have little visible relations to sex practice, such as life narrative and \ngenerational identity, can be heteronormative in this sense (p. 548). \nHeteronormativity, then, is normalizing the heterosexual. This is perpetuated in media, \nconversations, family values, and in various other subtle ways which often go unnoticed. \nFor example Elia (2003) writes: \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 25 \nThe institution of traditional family has set the direction and tone for sexual life. \nThe term family has long been synonymous not just with heterosexuality broadly \ndefined, but with a very specific brand of heterosexuality which involves \nmarriage, baby making, monogamy ... (p. 65). \nThis conflation of family, marriage, monogamy, and reproduction comes up quite often \nin Yahoo! comments, which I discuss more thoroughly in the analysis below. The \nconceptualization of the \"traditional,\" family, which Elia describes as heterosexual, \nmiddle class, and perpetuating \"white values\" (p. 65), becomes heteronormative. \nFurthermore, Yep (2003) writes \"normalization is a symbolically, discursively, \npsychically, psychologically, and materially violent form of social regulation and \ncontrol\" (p. 18). Therefore, Yep concludes, heteronormativity is violent; this \nnormalization of heterosexual privilege \"others\" LGBTQ individuals, accentuating \ndifference, and perpetuating the \"marginalization, disempowerment, and oppression of \nsexual others\" (p. 18). This heterosexual privilege creates inequality, which effects \npower distributions, as I discuss next. \nMoreover, \"othering\" also takes place within unequal power distributions. Hall \n(1997) writes \"power cannot be captured by thinking exclusively in terms of force or \ncoercion: power also seduces, solicits, induces, wins consent\" (p. 261). Power, therefore, \ncreates ideologies from which no one is immune. However, Hall (1997) also points out \nthat, although power influences everyone, both the powerful and powerless, these \nideological power influences effect groups in different ways. \"No one - neither its \napparent victims nor its agents - can stand wholly outside its field of operation\" (Hall, \n1997, p. 261). Like ideology, no one can escape power. This becomes important for my \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 26 \nanalysis as I investigate uncivil, hateful opinions which function to \"other\" the LGBTQ \ncommunity. Incivility, then, directly ties to \"othering\". By using hate speech and uncivil \ndiscourse, online posters are directly \"othering\" the LGBTQ community in a harmful, \nblatant way. However, through the use of critical discourse analysis, I not only \nproblematize this \"othering,\" but also expose the ideological influences which contribute \nto and normalize incivility. \nHuman rights and othering. LGBTQ individuals are \"othered\" through \ndeclarations of moral inferiority, but, as Hall suggests, issues of power also come into \nplay. The blatant denial of certain rights to LGBTQ individual certainly suggests \ninferiority and \"othering.\" For example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n(UDHR) lists marriage by consenting adults as a human right, yet LGBTQ individuals \nacross the world are often denied this right (Malik, Bogomolov, Chang, Cassin, \nRoosevelt, Dukes, Hodgson, Santa Cruz, & Humphrey, 1948). However, Encarnacion \n(2014) points out it was not until six decades after the UDHR was drafted that \"gay \nrights\" were incorporated into the document. Furthermore, Kalny (2009) writes \"the \ndignity of all human beings is a central value of human rights, and that this idea \nmaterializes in the prohibition of discrimination\" (p. 372). Therefore, by excluding, \ndiscriminating, or \"othering\" LGBTQ individuals, human rights are being denied. In \nfact, Madson and Odegard (2013) state \"there are few places in the world where it is truly \nsafe to be gay and there are even fewer places where it is safe to be a transgender or \ngender non-conforming person\" (p. 65). It is important to note, \"gay rights\" is not \nlimited to marriage rights, but rather recognition of equality as human beings. It should \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 27 \nnot be unsafe for LGBTQ individuals in any part of the world, let alone most parts of the \nworld. \nMuch of the \"othering\" and discourse surrounding the LGBTQ community may \noriginate from the failure to fully recognize \"gay rights\" as human rights. Likewise, there \nis a tendency for \"gay rights\" to be associated with \"special rights\" (Brickell, 2001 ), and \ntherefore, gay rights activists are thought to be seeking more than just \"equality\" but also \nlooking to \"move beyond it in search of 'special status and privileged treatment\"' (p. \n222). Of course, the assumption gay rights activists are seeking \"special rights\" is \nincredibly problematic, as it assumes the rights for LGBTQ individuals are not equal to \nthe rights of the majority. LGBTQ individuals have faced a long history of \ndiscrimination, both in the U.S. and throughout the world. Encarnacion (2014) writes: \nHomosexuality was classified as a mental disorder by the American Psychiatric \nAssociation until 1973, and by the World Health Organization until 1990. Anti-\nsodomy laws remained on the books in the United Kingdom until 1982, and in the \nUnited States until 2003, when the Supreme Court struck them down. In 1996, a \nDemocratic president, Bill Clinton, with the support of large majorities in both \nchambers of the Congress, signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which \ndefined marriage, for federal purposes, as the union of a man and a woman (p. \n37). \nAlthough, as Encarnacion also points out, DOMA was recently overturned in 2013, \nLGBTQ individuals still face legal discrimination and hate not only in the U.S., but \naround the world. This history of discrimination has an impact on the way LGBTQ \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 28 \nindividuals are perceived, as well as the discourse found on anonymous online comments, \nsuch as comments posting on Yahoo! News. \nPerversion and othering. There is a tendency for \"other\" sexualities to be tied to \nperversion. Terry (1995) states \"since the late nineteenth century, the body had been \ncentral to both scientific and popular constructions of the origins of homosexuality\" (p. \n129). This connection between the body and \"homosexuality\" has also discursively tied \nLGBTQ individuals to \"perversion\" or \"disease,\" as Terry (1995) points out. Further \nevidence of \"othering\" also exists in the reduction of LGBTQ individuals to genitalia, \nsuch as through the emphasis of the \"homosexual body,\" as well as the existence of anti-\nsodomy laws on the books in the U.S. as late as 2003. Furthermore, Millbank (2005) \nwrites in the U.K., LGBTQ individuals seeking asylum for persecution based on their \nidentity as LGBTQ are expected to \"be 'discreet' in their home countries to avoid \npersecution\" (p. 133). Millbank argues this creates a \"sexual other\" who is unfairly \nviewed as a sexual pervert undeserving of political asylum. Likewise, Reddy (2002) \nconducted a thematic analysis of statements made in the southern regions of Africa, \nwhich included discourse from \"newspaper reports, government press releases, activist \nliterature and the internet\" (p. 168). Reddy describes many of the comments as accusing \nindividuals, particularly gay men, of perversion, and linking LGBTQ individuals with \nbestiality. From this analysis, Reddy provides a list of terms commonly used to describe \nLGBTQ individuals including \"abnormal,\" \"barbaric,\" \"immoral,\" \"animalistic,\" and \n\"satanic.\" \nFrom the scholarly research discussed here, it is clear that across nations, LGBTQ \nindividuals are commonly conceptualized as unnatural, or discursively connected to \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 29 \nsexual \"perverts\". This very arbitrary discursive connection between \"gay\" and \nperversion is perpetuated in uncivil speech discourse, which I discuss more thoroughly in \nthe analysis section of this study. By casting LGBTQ individuals as sexual deviants, \nperverts, or \"unnatural,\" the discourse focuses heavily not only on difference, but also on \nvery negative, fallacious comparisons between LGBTQ individuals and the \"unnatural,\" \ndirectly marginalizing and \"othering\" the LGBTQ community. \nGender and othering. Hall et al. (1996) state \"gender is not a simple analytical \ncategory; it is, as feminist scholarship has increiJ;ingly documented, a relationship of \npower\" (p. 377). Because gender is a category of power, gender also becomes a category \nin which \"othering\" occurs. Furthermore, Wilchins (2004) states violations of gender \nnorms are often associated with assumptions of sexuality. Those who do not adhere to \ngender norms are viewed as the different or the \"other.\" However, Sedgwick (1990) \npoints out the arbitrary nature of the highly emphasized connection between sexuality and \ngender: \nOf the very many dimensions along which the genital activity of one person can \nbe differentiated from that of another (dimensions that include preference for \ncertain acts, certain zones or sensations, certain physical types, a certain \nfrequency, certain symbolic investments, certain relations of age or power, a \ncertain species, a certain number of participants, etc. etc. etc.), precisely one, the \ngender of object choice, emerged from the turn of the century, and has remained \nas the dimension denoted by the now ubiquitous category of \"sexual orientation\" \n(p. 8). \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 30 \nThe gendered assumptions that come along with discussions of sexuality are, indeed, \nfascinating. As Jagose (1996) points out, gender and sexuality are not the same thing, \nhowever, the \"othering\" which takes place based on gender and sexual orientation have \nties which cannot be ignored. Although this study aims to specifically discuss the \n\"othering\" ofLGBTQ individuals through online discourse, specifically Yahoo! News \ncomments, queer studies are informed by gender studies. Jagose (1996) points out a \"call \nto treat gender and sexuality as distinct but 'inextricable\"' (p. 122). \nCritical Discourse Analysis \nBy looking at online incivility using critical discourse analysis as a \nmethodological and theoretical lens, I hope to shed light on the ideological influences \nwhich contribute to incivility and hate speech. Fairclough (2003) defines \"discourse\" in \nthe following way, '\"Discourse' is used abstractly (as an abstract noun) for 'the domain \nof statements', and concretely as a 'count' noun ('a discourse', 'several discourses') for \ngroups of statements or for the 'regulated practice' (the rules) which govern such a group \nof statements\" (p. 124). Although discourse may have many uses and definitions, for the \npurpose of my study, I turn to Fairclough's (2003) definition of discourse as \"the domain \nof statements,\" as discussed above. I look specifically at the domain of online statements \nwhich utilize incivility and hate speech to create or suggest rules which function as an \nattempt to regulate sexuality, or at least how it is discussed. Moreover, power will also \nbe a vital component of rule-making within discourse. Wilchins (2004) writes: \nThe effects of discursive power are hard to see once a discourse is in place. Once \nwe see gay, black, female, or transgender people, it's hard to imagine that they \nweren't always there. We imagine the cultural discourse about them just popped \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 31 \nup in response; rather, it was the discourse that created such identities in the first \nplace (p. 71). \nAs Foucault (1990) also states, the powerful define what becomes socially significant in \nsociety. There is nothing about LGBTQ individuals that is controversial other than the \nfact the discourse which has defined them as such. People's differences, such as \nsexuality, are not innately important or naturally subjects of politics, but rather, they are \ndefined as such by discourse. Therefore, because discourse is so heavily influenced by \npower, while at the same time, perpetuating current power structures, it is vital that \nscholars critically analyze discourse in order to critique the status quo. Through critical \ndiscourse analysis, I intend to do this in my analysis of online discourse. \nCritical discourse analysis has been utilized to discuss debate about gays and \nlesbians being allowed in the U.S. military (Blain, 2005), Colorado joining \"the national \n'gay marriage' debate\" in 2006 (Jones, 2009, p. 59), a 1994 proposition in Idaho to block \nequal rights regardless of sexual orientation (Meyers, 1994), the reporting and language \nregarding AIDS (Lupton, 1993), and discourse about the television personalities from \nQueer Eye for the Straight Guy as stereotypical, as well as a look at performativity of \nsexual identity (Weiss, 2005). Critical discourse analysis (CDA) \"states that discourse is \nsocially constitutive as well as socially conditioned\" (Blommaert & Bulcaen, 2000, p. \n448). Language, therefore, is not simply a passive, neutral system of symbols used to \nrepresent material conditions, but rather a reflection of society's distribution of power, as \nwell as reflective of oppression. Blommaert and Bulcaen (2000) discuss \"discourse-as-\ntext\" as one dimension of CDA which will be particularly useful in an analysis of online \ninternet posting. They also discuss the importance of analyzing the context of comments \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 32 \nby looking specifically at vocabulary, such as wording and metaphors, as well as \ngrammar. In my analysis, for example, I leave all comments as they were written, \nincluding any grammatical errors, which may provide further insight to my analysis. \nConducting a critical textual analysis of online discourse is particularly challenging due \nto the absence of nonverbal cues. However, as Blommaert and Bulcaen (2000) point out \nabove, vocabulary, grammar and text structure each become more evident through a text, \nwhich will be useful for my analysis. Further, an analysis of hate-speech targeted at the \nLGBTQ community in general through internet comments follows in the path of popular \ntopics for which CDA has been used in the past. For example, political discourse, \nideology, and gender, which are three of the nine popular domains of analysis Blommaert \nand Bulcaen (2000) cite as integral to CDA, may each come into play through this \nanalysis. \nThe portrayal of gay and lesbian individuals through online commenting is telling \nof the ideological influences of our time. Meyers (1994) states: \nThe media both reflect and reproduce the dominant ideology of their times ... the \nnews media's portrayal of gay men and lesbians as either deserving or \nundeserving of civil rights not only tells us about their social standing and the \nprevailing societal view of homosexuality, but it also points to ways in which that \nportrayal may be challenged (p. 322). \nBecause my study looks at internet discourse posted on online news articles, the framing \nof the news article, as well as the comments from internet users will both come into play \nin my analysis. The context of the story certainly impacts the resulting discussion on the \ncomment boards. I look at incivility in internet comments, some of which are \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS \nexceptionally uncivil, and how those comments are rationalized in order to not only \nfurther understand the ideologies under which they thrive, but also in an attempt to \nfurther challenge those ideologies, as Meyers (1994) points out above. \n33 \nIn order to successfully perform a critical discourse analysis of online comments, \nI look at published analyses using CDA as exemplars. One such example is Blain's \n(2005) critical discourse analysis of an anti-gay campaign in Idaho. In 1994, an initiative \nin Idaho, called the 'no special rights' initiative, \"represented themselves as conservative \nIdaho citizens fighting a culture war to preserve traditional family values against a \npowerful, sexually perverse subject with a militant gay agenda\" (Blain, 2005, p. 31.) As \nBlommaert and Bulcaen (2000) point out, CDA can be used to expose ideological \ninfluences about gender and sex in written discourse. Fairclough (2003) points out \nideologies influence the ways we talk about, and therefore discursively define, people. \nThe ways LGBTQ individuals are talked about, then, influences the way the LGBTQ \ncommunity becomes represented in discourse, thus perpetuating oppression and \nexploitation. For example, the arguments against equal lesbian and gay rights, as \nexemplified in Idaho in 1994, often frame the struggle for equality as a \"sinister gay \nagenda\" which threatens families and children (Blain, 2005, p. 31 ). Further, lesbians and \ngays are often portrayed as sinners, kinky, untrustworthy, not productive in society, easily \nspotted, suicidal, and constituting an insignificant part of the population (Meyers, 1994). \nSimilarly, Jones (2009) draws from Fairclough's (2003), use of existential, propositional, \nand value assumptions. Jones discusses political discourse in Colorado as making \nassumptions about what exists (existential assumptions), about what can be (propositional \nassumptions), or what is moral or good (value assumptions) regarding same-sex \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 34 \nmarnage. I look at themes similar to Meyers (1994) and Jones (2009) in anti-LGBTQ \ndiscourse, specifically assumptions which unveil ideologies about gender and sexuality. \nThese ideological influences in casual internet discourse, from what I have seen from past \nresearch, though many times extreme and hateful, accurately mirror the political \ndiscourse outlined in Blain's (2005) article about anti-gay political discourse. Using \nCDA, I want to analyze the everyday discourse found in internet news comments \nsections. Blain (2005) points out membership categorization devices (MCDs) can be used \nin discourse analysis to show how a group frames their membership, activities, and \nmotives. The binary categories posters employ to define both themselves and their \nopposition are also telling of ideological influences, as well as polarizing, and therefore, \nproblematic. For example, Blain (2005) discusses \"victimage rhetoric\" as a strategy for \nvillianizing the \"gay agenda\" while simultaneously casting the actor's agenda, as well as \nstrategic others into the role of victim (p. 37). By casting themselves as the victims, \ninternet posters strategically draw attention away from the incivility of their own \ncomments. \nIn addition to the blatant hate speech in internet comments discourse, I also want \nto look at the more latent gender ideologies which are exposed through anti lesbian and \ngay discourse. Wilchins (2004) points out \"gay activists have continued to fight for \nmainstream acceptance by pointedly comparing gayness to straightness\" (pp. 126-127). \nWhile, on the surface, this comparison appears favorable by pointing out sameness, it \nalso reifies heteronormativity by suggesting there is something wrong with anything \nwhich differs from straightness. Therefore, this strategy implicates heteronormativity and \nheterosexism as being normalized through ideology. Patriarchy and heterosexism are, \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 35 \naccording to Wilchins (2004 ), the most oppressive forms of normalized knowledge, \nwhich regulate gender performance and perpetuate homophobic ideas. Weiss (2005) \ndiscusses gender as a performance, describing the stars of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy \nas linguistically encoding themselves of the feminine or masculine gender in various \ninstances. However, because gender is a socially constructed concept and is performed, \nrather than inherited, any statements problematizing gender performances based on \nsexual orientation will, from a critical discourse standpoint, become interesting texts for \nanalysis. These statements should cast light on associations between sex and social roles \nand gender, as well as performance and gender. Meyers (1994) also points out \"the \npresence of gay men in the armed forces provides a direct challenge to the notions of \nmasculinity and manhood\" (p. 323). Regardless of other problems with this view of gay \nmen, this notion is also telling in other important ways regarding gender. If the armed \nforces must represent \"masculinity and manhood\", where does that leave women? \nMoreover, while gay men both in and out of the military are perceived as a threat to \nmasculinity, women are regulated by gender roles as well, which may manifest in online \ncomments regarding lesbians. Wilchins (2004) writes \"women in suits and ties or men in \ndresses still make us profoundly uncomfortable\" (p. 9). As I discuss above, Wilchins \ndescribes women in the feminist movement as a threat to femininity, as well as \n\"advancing the homosexual agenda\". Wilchins also details how feminists are often \nassumed to be lesbians due in part because of feminists wanting to eliminate \"all sexual \ndifferences\" (p. 9). Because gay and lesbian individuals are so often, erroneously, \nassociated with gender role violations, confronting gender ideologies in my analysis \ncould be thought-provoking. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS \nAs Jones (2009) writes, \"CDA provides a method couched within a larger \nperspective that primarily focuses on the way social power, dominance, and inequality \nare presented, reproduced and resisted\" (p. 65). I pull from CDA as a conceptual \nframework and methodology throughout my analysis. In the next section, I discuss in \nmore detail my incorporation of CDA, as well as my methodological approach. \n36 \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 37 \nMethodology \nThis section details the methods I utilized for collecting and analyzing data for \nthis research study. In this study, I analyze online comments sections on Yahoo! News \nstories which report on LGBTQ-related issues. Through this analysis, I hope to better \nunderstand the ideological influences on discourses pertaining to gender and sexual \norientation in the discussion of LGBTQ individuals and issues. During this analysis, I \nconsider the following research questions: \nRQl: In what ways do online comments perpetuate and reinforce homophobia? \nRQ2: In what ways do incivility and homophobia work together in internet \ncomments? \nRQ3: What are the connections between homophobic comments and oppressive \ngender ideologies? \nThroughout my research, I consider each of these questions, and I discuss my findings in \nthe conclusions section of this research study. However, I first discuss my rationale for \nusing online comments via Yahoo! News as a text for analysis. \nRationale \nBlommaert and Bulcaen (2000) discuss \"discourse-as-text\" as an important part of \nCDA. Online comments are a rich text for analysis, through CDA, as they provide an \narchived, easily accessible, and unfiltered glimpse into internet discourse about the \nLGBTQ community. I chose to analyze comments on Yahoo! News specifically for \nseveral reasons. First, from my experience, Yahoo! News tends to have the most user \ncomments when compared to other online news media. Furthermore, Yahoo! functions \nas the homepage for many people, and therefore the news stories featured on the \nhomepage attracts many readers and comments. Additionally, users give \"thumbs up\" or \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 38 \n\"thumbs down\", which indicates how popular, unpopular or controversial a comment is \nperceived, which I discuss further below. The final reason I chose Yahoo! News as the \nmedium for my analysis is my own personal familiarity with the website. I have done \nprevious analyses using Yahoo! internet comments, and I am familiar with navigating the \nknow from experience many Yahoo! News articles accumulate quite a few comments, \nwhich translates into a text ripe for analysis. \nData Collection \nI collected the data for my analysis during the last two weeks of January, 2014. \nThe first step in my data collection was to find pertinent news stories reporting on issues \nrelating to the LGBTQ community. In order to find relevant news stories to address my \nresearch questions, on the Yahoo! News webpage, I conducted a search using keywords \nsuch as \"LGBTQ\", \"lesbian\" \"gay\", and \"same-sex marriage\". After each search, I \ncollected the URLs of Yahoo! News articles which reported on LGBTQ news-related \nitems. I intentionally selected only recent news articles, meaning I selected only articles \nposted by Yahoo! in 2014. Furthermore, I did not choose multiple articles about the \nsame topic, such as multiple articles about anti-gay policies in Russia, so to collect a \nvaried sample of online comments relating to LGBTQ issues and to find a broad range of \ncommentary. I chose relevant articles based on the original keyword search, as well as \nthe title of the article itself Through my keyword searches, I chose several Yahoo! News \narticles during the last two weeks of January, 2014. I copied each relevant article's URL \ninto a Microsoft Word document for later use. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 39 \nWhen choosing which articles I utilize for this analysis, I purposefully chose \narticles which discussed varied and international LGBTQ issues, in an attempt to create a \nbroader analysis. I also made sure to include news which related to both gay men and \nlesbian women. However, news articles which discussed lesbian rights specifically were \nrather difficult to find on Yahoo! News at the time of my data collection. Therefore, I \nmade sure to include at least one article that specifically reported on news relating to \nlesbian women. However, this particular article, as well as one other article, only \naccumulated one comment, which I discuss in greater detail below. \nEach Yahoo! News article contains a comments section located beneath the news \nstory in which Yahoo! News readers may make comments. This discussion board is not \nmoderated. Commenters can post what I would term \"main\" comments2, or they may \ncomment on another poster's comment with a \"reply\" 3 comment. Commenters can \neither engage each other through commenting, or by giving a \"thumbs up\" or a \"thumbs \ndown\" 4 to each comment, thus allowing the Yahoo! News comments to be sorted in a \nvariety of ways, based on most responded, popularity, recency, etc. To ensure I received \nas many useful comments as possible, I refrained from collecting comments from news \nstories that were less than three days old at the time of data collection. This was in an \n2 Main comments are those comments which a commenter posted which do not necessarily respond to \nanother commenter's post. \n3 Reply comments appear under main comments. Under each main comment, Yahoo! News provides a \n\"reply\" button, which commenters can utilize to reply to main comments. These comments are meant to \nallow responses to main comments, though commenters often engage each other through discussions, \ndebates or arguments via reply comments. Therefore, reply comments cannot be ranked according to \npopularity, and though users can respond to one another, there is not a space provided to reply to other \nreply comments. Rather, reply comments are ordered chronologically. A majority of the data in this \nanalysis comes from reply comments due to commenters entering into long dialogues with one another \nthrough these \"replies.\" \n4 The \"thumbs up\" and \"thumbs down\" buttons allow for comments to be ranked by popularity. Each \n\"thumbs up\" from another Yahoo! user gives the comment a point, while a \"thumbs down\" takes away a \npoint. When sorting by popularity, the comments with more points appear at the top, though the recency of \nthe post is also considered in this ranking. Comments can be ranked in this way by clicking the \"Popular \nNow\" button. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 40 \nattempt to give commenters ample time to write comments, respond to other users and \ncreate a dialogue, as well as \"like\" or \"dislike\" posts. After choosing five news stories \nand allowing for at least three days for comments to accumulate, I looked at the \ncomments under each article. For any articles with fewer than 10 total comments, I \ncollected all comments as data. For articles with more than 10 comments, I sorted the \ncomments by \"Popular Now\" and collected the first 10 comments, as well as any \nresponses (sub-comments) to those original posts. Next, I sorted comments by \"Most \nReplied\", and once again, collected the first 10 comments and responses. Any duplicate \ncomments were collected only once. All collected comments were copied into a \nMicrosoft Word document and saved for future analysis-then each comment was \nlabeled according to the article it appeared under and the order it was ranked either under \n\"Popular Now\" 5 or \"Most Replied.\" 6 \nIn critical discourse analysis, Blommaert and and Bulcaen (2000) stress the \nimportance of considering the context in which comments take place. Therefore, I \nprovide a context for the comments through a short description of each news story from \nwhich I collected comments. The articles I discuss in this study are as follows: \n1. Grammys turn mass wedding in gay marriage celebration (2014)-This article \nreports on the 2014 Grammys, in which 34 couples were married during the \nawards show in celebration of same-sex marriage. From this story I collected 20 \nmain comments, as well as 637 reply comments which respond to those \ncomments for a total of 657 online comments. \n5 Sorting by \"Popular Now\" ranks comments based on a mixture of popularity according to \"thumbs up\" \nand \"thumbs down\" as well as recency. \n6 Comments sorted by \"Most Replied\" ranks the comments from those with the most \"reply\" comments \nfirst to those with no replies. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 41 \n2. Austrian court ends insemination ban for lesbian pairs (Shields, 2014)-In \nthis article, Shields reports on Austria overturning a previously held ban which \nprevented lesbian couples from using sperm donations in order to have children. \nThis article had only 1 main comment available for collection with zero reply \ncomments. \n3. Online Simulations Help Educators Help Troubled LGBTQ Students: Trevor \nProject, Kognito Interactive Release Online Training to Assist At-Risk LGBTQ \nYouths (Bryan, 2014)-Bryan discusses the introduction of the Trevor Project, \nwhich uses online, interactive simulations \"that help educators and students gain \nthe skills and knowledge needed to help at-risk young people\" (para. 3), \nspecifically LGBTQ youth. This article had only 1 comment available for \ncollection with zero reply comments. \n4. Same-sex couples challenge Florida ban on gay marriage (Richey, 2014)-In \nthis article, Richey outlines same-sex marriage bans across the United States, \nfocusing specifically on a recent lawsuit filed in Florida \"challenging the state's \nban on gay marriage on grounds that it violates fundamental guarantees of the US \nConstitution, including a right to marry regardless of sexual orientation\" (para. 1 ). \nFrom this article, I collected 20 main comments and 128 reply comments which \nresponded to those main comments, for a total of 148 comments. \n5. Ivory Coast: Mob attacks gay rights group office (Corey-Boulet, 2014)-here \nCorey-Boulet describes the violent ransacking of a gay rights organization in the \nIvory Coast, in Africa. Notably, the author states many view the recent \nstrengthening of anti-LGBTQ laws throughout Africa as retaliation against the \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 42 \nU.S. and European use of \"leverage to promote the human rights of gay people \naround the world\" (para. 3). From this article, I collected 19 main comments (one \nmain comment was in the top 10 of both the \"Popular Now\" and \"Most Replied\" \nsections) and 17 4 reply comments which responded to those main comments, for \na total of 193 comments. \nFrom the five articles in my sample, I collected a total of 61 main comments, with 939 \nthread comments, or \"sub-comments\" which were in direct response to the collected main \ncomments. This resulted in a total of 1000 comments in my sample, which I analyze and \ndiscuss further below. I copied each comment and sub-comment into a Microsoft Word \ndocument, labeling which news story the comment was collected from, the author of the \ncomment's usemame, and whether the comment was a \"main\" comment or a \"sub-\ncomment\". I kept the comments organized so any conversations via sub-comments were \nleft in context. Any comments made on the news story after I copied them to the Word \ndocument are not used in this analysis. During my analysis, I refer only back to the data I \ncollected in the Word document, rather than the original news story. \nCoding and Data Analysis \nAfter collecting comments, I sorted through all the comments, looking for both \nthemes in commenting as well as instances of \"incivility\" and \"othering\", as discussed \nabove. In order to code for over-arching themes, I utilized open coding. Lindlof and \nTaylor (2002) describe the process of open coding: \nThe analyst usually goes through the texts line by line and marks those chunks of \ntext that suggest a category. In fact, it is through the process of open coding that \ncategories are built, are named, and have attributes ascribed to them. This stage \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS \nof coding is \"unrestricted\" because the analyst has not yet decided the range of \ncategories or how the categories are defined (p. 219). \n43 \nSimilarly, I went through the sampled comments, and labeled comments according to the \ngeneral message of the comment. For example, a comment consisting of a quoted Bible \nverse was labeled \"religion.\" Some comments, particularly longer posts, were given \nmore than one label, as the comment embodied multiple themes. Any incoherent \ncomments, or posts I could not make sense of for any reason were not labeled. After \nlabeling each comment, I looked for common themes. Labeling the comments allowed \nkeyword searches in order to find comments which fell into those over-arching themes. \nFrom this coding, three distinct themes became clear: human rights, perversion, and \ngender. \nIn order to analyze these comments, I look for instances of incivility and \n\"othering,'', while also looking for over-arching themes in the comments, both within \neach news story, as well as in the entire sample. I analyze these themes and individual \ncomments using critical discourse analysis. Fairclough (2003) has defined discourse as \n\"the domain of statements\" (p. 124). In this case, I analyze the domain of statements \nmade about LGBTQ individuals or LGBTQ issues in Yahoo! News comments. \nBlommaert and Bulcaen (2000) describe discourse as a text which can be analyzed, \nthrough critical discourse analysis, to uncover the ideological influences and power \ndistributions which influence the way people talk and think about certain issues. In this \nanalysis, I utilize critical discourse analysis to analyze these comments in an attempt to \nuncover the ideological and power influences contributing to the oppression ofLGBTQ \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS \nindividuals, as well as gender ideologies which are perpetuated through this \nmarginalization. \n44 \nAs Haugh (2010) points out there is quite a bit of ''variability across individuals in \nregards to their evaluations of certain instances of behavior as (im)polite\" (p. 11 ). The \ncomments I analyze in this research, of course, are my own evaluation of what is \ninappropriate, however, I also attempted to keep in mind Johnson, Cooper, and Chin's \n(2008) definition of \"flaming\" as \"the antinormative hostile communication of \nemotions ... that includes the use of profanity, insults, and other offensive or hurtful \nstatements\" (p. 419), as well as the research regarding civility and anonymity as I \ncollected and analyzed the data. It is impossible to tell the location from which \ncomments originate, the poster's gender, age, or any other identification other than the \ntime of posting and the language they have posted in, and therefore the context of the \nposts are ambiguous. Laineste (2013) states \"particularly typical of computer mediated \ncommunication (CMC) is the enhanced ambiguity of statements\" (p. 30). For example, \nas I mentioned in my discussion of civility, sometimes users will purposefully \"flame\" \ndiscussion boards as a way of getting attention. Without verbal cues, it becomes difficult \nto know the exact meaning and intentions behind online comments. I address this lack of \nverbal cues in a variety of ways. By sorting through the posts by popularity and \nresponses, I hope to dispel ambiguity to a certain extent. Although a certain comment \nmay indicate an attempt to \"flame,\" if it becomes a popular comment, I can reasonably \nassume the comment, whether intentionally inflammatory or not, represents the opinion \nof other Yahoo! users, or at least garners other comm enters approval. Moreover, I keep \nall posts in context as much as possible by maintaining all grammar and spelling errors. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 45 \nHowever, author intention, under any circumstance, cannot be known, and therefore I \nvalue interpretation, both by myself as the research and the commenters who respond via \nsub-comments and \"thumbs up\"/\"thumbs down\" voting, over author intention. What the \nauthor may or may not have been trying to say is not necessarily important, because, as \nalways, it is impossible to know a communicator's intent. Rather, how comments are \ninterpreted by other commenters, or the ideological assumptions which comments \nperpetuate is significant, and the basis of this analysis. Jones (2009) writes \"language is \nthe primary domain of ideology, or power and inequality ... assumptions, as a conceptual \ncomponent of CDA, help unpack the power and hegemony within texts\" (p. 65). One \nshort sentence in a comments section can reflect many underlying discourses and \nideologies. Through CDA, I will unpack these heteronormative ideologies in this \nanalysis. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 46 \nData Analysis/Results \nIn this section, I discuss the results of my data analysis. I discuss themes in \nYahoo! News comments, as well as issues of incivility and \"othering\" using critical \ndiscourse analysis. While several clear and distinct themes arose from this data, many \ncomments are exemplars of multiple themes. These themes do not stand alone, but are \nconnected based on the meanings Yahoo! commenters place on the LGBTQ community, \ntying together discourses of human rights, perversion, and gender in many ways. Many \nargue, at a very basic level that gender norm violations are perverse, and argue human \nrights are being violated by those who would maintain established gender norms. I \ndiscuss each of these themes (human rights, perversion and gender) in separate sections \nin some detail, however, it is important to note these themes are interrelated. \nHuman Rights and Law \nAs Meyers (1994) pointed out, the discourse surrounding human rights in the \nmedia, whether arguing LGBTQ individuals are \"deserving or undeserving of civil \nrights\" (p. 322), sheds light on current ideologies, as well as provides an opportunity for \ninsight into how problematic ideologies surrounding equality may be challenged. Human \nrights are a major theme in this data, regardless of opinion regarding LGBTQ-related \nissues and regardless of which article from which the Yahoo! users respond. Both \nsupporters and opponents of equality for LGBTQ individuals brought up issues of basic \nhuman rights as support for their arguments. Those who supported the LGBTQ \ncommunity argued unequal rights, with a particular emphasis on marriage rights, were a \nviolation of human rights. Likewise, many Yahoo! News posters argued inequality \nregarding marriage rights was unconstitutional or else generally illegal. On the other \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 47 \nhand, those who argued against equality also cited human rights/law in support of their \narguments. Many argued the inclusion of LGBTQ individuals into the news was a \nviolation of the population's rights, as this inclusion effectively forced society to see or \nhear about LGBTQ individuals, citing a \"gay agenda.\" This \"gay agenda\" is often argued \nto come at the expense of the well-being of the majority, as well as violating the rights of \nthose who wish to avoid any form of contact with LGBTQ individuals. Moreover, other \ncommenters argued the United States was violating the human rights of other nations by \nsupporting LGBTQ equality, and others argued the U.S., at least, have achieved equality \nalready. \nThose who offer supportive messages towards the LGBTQ community argue it is \na basic human right to choose how and with whom to live their lives. For example, mt \n(Grammys) writes \"You are WAY too concerned about the gay lifestyle and how THEY \ndecide to live it and you need to really just focus on your own lives and focus on how to \nfix your own damn issues because I am sure you have plenty of your own!\" Furthermore, \nPat (Grammys) 7 points out \"equal protection under the law\" protects LGBTQ people, \nand another commenter, appy (Grammys) states \"the funny thing it does not make a \ndifference whether someone is born gay or not. Is they are US citizens then they have the \nsame rights as everyone else.\" Similarly, Wags (Ivory Coast) states \"Why do people hate \ngays? Live and let live.\" Each poster states LGBTQ individuals should have the same \nbasic human rights as everyone else under the law, including lifestyle and personal \nchoices regarding love and romantic partners. Those who argue for inclusive human \nrights mirror the UDHR, which states in Article 1 \"all human beings are born free and \n7 Each commenter is cited by their usemame, as well as a keyword or phrase indicating the title of the \nYahoo! News article on which they have commented. All comments are left as they were written, \nincluding any incorrect grammar or word usage, offensive language, etc. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 48 \nequal in dignity and rights\" (Malik et al., 1948). As described in the literature review \nabove, Lane and McCourt (2013) use keywords such as ethics, politeness, norms or social \nrules/social order to describe civility. Arguing for inclusive human rights for LGBTQ \nindividuals is certainly ethical. Similarly, with the possible exception of mt's \ncommenter, there is nothing in any of the above examples which is blatantly uncivil. \nFinally, as appy points out, U.S. laws protect individuals from discrimination, and \ntherefore inclusive rights for LGBTQ individuals, in the U.S. at the very least, follows \npreviously established norms and social rules. The arguments for inclusive human rights \nfor LGBTQ individuals, then, as exemplified by the comments cited above, are largely \ncivil. However, these arguments mediated through Yahoo! News comments, as I will \ndiscuss more thoroughly below, are often disregarded by other commenters who opt to \npost hateful, illogical, or \"flaming\" posts, ultimately creating an uncivil communication \nclimate in which thoughtful commentary is rendered useless. \nInterestingly, those who write messages condemning the LGBTQ community also \npoint to human rights, though most likely conceptualized quite differently, to support \ntheir opinions. For example T.S. (Grammys) comments stating \"these idiots don't know \nhow to accept others that are not like themselves. They were taught, racism, \ndiscrimination and to hate others by their parents. They are now a minority in the US and \nthat makes me happy,\" to which For the Love of God (Grammys) responds: \n@T.S. The truth is: everything that homosexuals accuse others of...is what they \nare haters, discriminatory, and bigots. They use equality and fairness pulling \nthemselves up on the bootstraps of the civil rights movement. However, and this \nis what all Americans need to know, this perversion is not only sexual, it is the \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 49 \ncorruption of society. Homosexuals will take away the rights of others to speak \nfreely and will pervert justice on every level. Isn't that what the homosexual \nFederal Judge is doing by completely denying the rights of millions of Americans \nwho voted to banned this vile and heinous sin from their communities? Yet, \nhomosexuals push it down their throats through television and other media \noutlets. Homosexuality is a great evil and perversion that needs to be stopped and \nstopped now! Much much prayer and speaking to officials and the government \nneeds to be done. People need to know where this is going ... obviously to the \ndecline and end of a great nation. \nIn addition to the clear incivility occurring from both sides of this interaction through \nname-calling, exaggeration, insults, and mockery, as Sobieraj and Berry (2011) describe \nas incivility via outrage, this poster also directly states the LGBTQ community is \nsomehow taking away the rights and voices of others. Furthermore, For The Love Of \nGod is also insinuating voters have the right to oppress minorities, which is now being \nviolated through the passing of more inclusive laws, such as the recent Illinois House of \nRepresentatives vote passing a marriage equality bill (Davey & Yaccino, 2013). \nOn a similar note, many anti-LGBTQ sentiments, particularly in response to the \narticle reporting on marriages at the 2014 Grammys, suggest human rights are being \nviolated due to the forcible exposure of gay people in the media. For example, as quoted \nby For The Love Of God (Grammys) above, many Yahoo! posters seem to feel there is a \n\"gay agenda\" which is being forced on the public via \"television and other media \noutlets.\" The use of the term \"gay agenda\" by Yahoo! News commenters is significant. \nThe \"gay agenda\" is also cited by scholars cited in the literature review above (Blain, \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 50 \n2005; Wilchins, 2004). The \"gay agenda,\" then, is a very common argument in anti-\nLGBTQ discourses, not only in Yahoo! comments, but in the discourses which shape \ndiscriminatory laws in the U.S. and abroad. These Yahoo! News users are stating the \npublic has the right to avoid seeing any support for the LGBTQ community in the media, \nwhich is reflective of popular opinions and the normalization of heterosexual privilege \n(Yep, 2003 ), and consequently extremely valuable to study. Steven ( Grammys ), in \nresponse to criticism of his original comment stating the Grammys should be an escape \nfrom anything political, such as, apparently, gay and lesbian people, states: \nI'm not whining about gays. If you read my post, you would know that. I'm \ncomplaining that gay rights is a divisive issue and it's being intentionally \nintroduced into every aspect of pop culture. Not everyone wants to hear about this \nissue 24/7. Gays can get married in California now. Let's start focusing on serious \nissues like juvenile cancers and our broken educational system. There are issues \nthat affect a lot more than 15% of the population that we can all get behind and \nagree with. \nThis comment is certainly problematic, in that it defines LGBTQ equality as an issue that \ndoes not qualify as a \"serious issue.\" Moreover, by suggesting LGBTQ issues are \n\"introduced into every aspect of pop culture\" as well as discussed \"24/7 ,\" Steven \nsuggests a \"gay agenda\" which forces LGBTQ individuals onto the public in general. \nSimilarly, Iowegin Incolorado (Grammys) states \"my wife watched this too ... so \nunfortunately, I had the misfortune of witnessing the \"marriage.'\" Both users are \nsuggesting that having LGBTQ individuals in the media, the public's apparent right to \navoid, or else not witness LGBTQ issues is being violated. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 51 \nThere are two major issues arising from these particular comments which are vital \nto my analysis. First, Steven and Iowegin Incolorado are \"othering\" the LGBTQ \ncommunity. As stated in the literature review above, \"othering\" is defined as \"the \nprocess of attaching moral codes and inferiority to difference\" (Krumer-Nevo & Sidi, \n2012, p. 300). When Steven implies LGBTQ equality is not a \"serious issue,\" there is a \nmoral judgment being made. Steven implies LGBTQ individuals and the issues \nimportant to them are not serious, and therefore, inferior. Likewise, there are issues of \npower made clear by this statement. Hall (1997) mentions \"othering\" occurs when the \nmajority exerts its influence over minority groups, labeling them as different. This \n\"othering\" creates heterosexism and privilege in which the dominant group becomes \nnormalized, going unmarked as the measure by which all other groups are compared. By \nsuggesting LGBTQ individuals do not have a place in the media because the majority \n(the public) wants to escape, via media, from what boils down to essentially minority \nproblems, Yahoo! commenters are \"othering\" marginalized groups, in this case, the \nLGBTQ community. Likewise, this argument also fits Meyers' (1994) findings which \nstate lesbian women and gay men are an insignificant portion of the population, and \ntherefore, need not be represented in the media. Moreover, this argument qualifies as \nuncivil. Arnett (2001) states \"a civil society offers a common space for diverse \nstandpoints\" (p. 327). The belittling and \"othering\" of LGBTQ individuals in online \ndiscourse does not create a space for diverse opinions. Furthermore, Lane and McCourt's \n(2013) conceptualization of civility consisting of ethics, politeness, and the incorporation \nof social norms is certainly not represented by the comments cited above. Alternatively, \nby performing marriages, including same-sex marriages, on the Grammys, diversity was \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 52 \nincluded in media representations, although, this more accepting representation also \ncommodified lesbian and gay couples as well. However, those arguing LGBTQ \nindividuals be kept out of the media so the majority need not be subjected to diverse, \n\"different\" lifestyles, are supporting the exact opposite. Furthermore, many commenters \nargue by seeing the \"different\" lifestyles of LGBTQ individuals in the media, those \ncommenters are being subjected to \"perversion,\" which I will discuss thoroughly in the \nsection below. \nIn addition to anti-LGBTQ comments suggesting inclusivity as a violation of \npersonal human rights by being subjected to gay people's existence, other Yahoo! posters \ndescribe a violation of children's rights by being subjected to gay or lesbian parents, or \nby simply witnessing an LGBTQ individual. Similarly, many argue parental rights are \nbeing threatened by LGBTQ individuals, arguing essentially parents should not need to \nexplain \"why 2 men were kissing\" (The Jokester, Grammys turn mass wedding), for \nexample. Moreover, many equate LGBTQ individuals, particularly gay men, to perverts \nand/or pedophiles, which I discuss more thoroughly below, and argue gay parents are a \nviolation of a child's right to grow up with a mother and a father figure. For example, \nOlga (Same-sex couples) states \"The BEST parents are a child's natural parents (mom \nand dad), who want them.\" This argument suggests same-sex couples choosing to raise \nchildren are therefore depriving a child from their right to \"natural\" parents, consisting of \nboth a mother and father. However, the discussion children's rights are not limited to \nbigoted, uncivil comments. For example T.S. (Grammys) states \"bad behavior and bad \nchoices are teaching your children not to like anyone who is not like them. \nDiscrimination, hate and intolerance are all taught characteristics.\" However, this \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 53 \nstatement, which appears to be a beacon of reason and thought in a web of incivility and \nhate, was followed up with comparisons of gay men to pedophiles, a plethora of bible \nverses quoted, which resulted in T.S., the same commenter quoted above, stating \"these \nidiots don't know how to accept others that are not like themselves. They were taught, \nracism, discrimination and to hate others by their parents. They are now a minority in the \nUS and that makes me happy.\" Yahoo! News comments appear not to facilitate \nthoughtful, civil discussions. Even those commenters who support LGBTQ equality \noften resort to petty name-calling or individual attacks. I discuss the ineffectiveness of \nYahoo! comment boards to facilitate civil, thoughtful discussion more thoroughly in the \nconclusions. \nInterestingly, in response to Corey-Boulet's (2014) Yahoo! news article detailing \nthe attack of a gay-rights organization in Africa, as well as the accusations of the U.S. \nand Europe using \"leverage\" to alleviate the violation of human rights of LGBTQ \nindividuals in Africa, many posters suggest the general population of Africa is being \n\"colonized,\" a claim which insinuates human rights violations, by the intentional spread \nof \"homosexual\" ideologies and acceptance. For example, Rasalase (Ivory Coast) \ncomments: \nwestern countries and the U.S should stop promoting homosexuality and \nthreatening Africans and the rest of other nation to be something they don't want \nto be. they should come up with different methods or tactics to control world \npopulation. British were popular spreading homosexuality since 17th 18th century \nin Africa and other part of the world also creating conflicts and war between \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 54 \ntribes and countries to gain power to loot there natural resources and now they are \npushing hard to make 3rd world countries homosexuals. \nThis comment suggests a \"colonization\" of other countries, by the West, spreading \nmessages of equality, which is framed, by this commenter, as problematic. Similarly, in \nresponse to the same article, Rose (Ivory Coast) writes: \nWHAT I DONT UNDERSTAND IS WHY ARE THESE WHITE COUNTRIES \nPRESSING AFRICAN CONTRIES TO EXCEPT HOMOSEXUALS IF THEY \nDONT WANT IT IN THERE COUNTRY ... ALL HOPE IS GONE FOR THESE \nWHITE COUNTRIES IMPOSING THESE NASTY THINGS TO THE WORLD \nBEFORE THESE COUNTRIES STARTED MESSING WITH AFRICA THEY \nWAS IMPOSING ALL THIS VIOLENCE ON THE AFRICAN PEOPLE THEY \nNEED TO STAY OUT OF THINGS THAT GO ON IN AFRICA. \nIn response to Rose's comment, a Yahoo! news user going by the name towndrunk (Ivory \nCoast) writes \"I guess the US is raciest. Trying to enslave these black people to the gay \nrights.\" Corey-Boulet (2014), the author of the Yahoo! News article about the attacks on \nthe gay rights organization in the Ivory Coast, points out Western nations are using \n\"leverage to promote the human rights of gay people around the world\" (para. 3), which \nhas caused many African leaders to react by intensifying anti-LGBTQ laws across the \ncontinent. Many of the commenters on this article react to this statement in the article \nitself, describing this as a human rights violation against the people of Africa by the U.S. \nWhile this is clearly ties to issues of colonization, there are also clear issues of human \nrights violations against LGBTQ individuals in the Ivory Coast involved with the attacks \nCorey-Boulet (2014) has reported. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 55 \nHowever, the human rights violations against the LGBTQ community in the Ivory \nCoast, troublingly, are far less discussed, though not completely ignored. For example, a \nposter called Republicant (Ivory Coast) points out the violence against the LGBTQ \ncommunity, stating \"Because violence is totally better than two people loving eachother.\" \nLikewise, the user Wags (Ivory Coast) stated \"live and let live\" while a Yahoo! News \nposter called LoveMyFamily (Ivory Coast) states \"I'm against Gay rights, because God \nspoke against it. But this is not the way to handle this. Harming people or hurting people \nis not the answer to this problem.\" Although LoveMyFamily explicitly states \"I'm \nagainst Gay rights\", this user also points out violence is not an acceptable response. \nTherefore, although LoveMyFamily opposes \"Gay rights\", at the same time, this Yahoo! \nuser also supports, at the very least, the right of LGBTQ individuals, as cited in Article 5 \nof the UDHR that \"no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment\" (Malik et al., 1948) by promoting non-violent responses, and therefore \ncontradicting him or herself. This may suggest some Yahoo! posters may be restricting \ntheir definitions of \"Gay rights\" to marriage equality. Similarly, by using phrases such as \n\"Gay rights\" or \"gay agenda\", which I discuss below, many of the comments in this \nsample seem focused particularly on gay men, and therefore are less focused on lesbian, \nbisexual, transgender, or those individuals who identify as queer, but not necessarily \n\"gay\", though this may also be in response to the wording in the original news articles, as \nthe news articles tend to focus heavily on gay men, rather than other identities. \nIn addition to human rights being used to argue against inclusive rights for \nLGBTQ individuals, the \"gay agenda\" was often discussed as a type of agenda the \nLGBTQ community was imposing on the majority population, which was conceptualized \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 56 \nby many commenters as a violation of majority rights. This agenda is often framed as the \nattempted violation of the human rights of those who do not wish to be subjected to \nanother person's life choices. For example, Matthew (Grammys) states \"by forcing us to \nwatch this public showing on a national stage the way they did, is in fact pushing the gay \nagenda on those of us who would rather not see it! ! ! I just don't watch TV anymore, that \nfixed my issue!!!\" Likewise Tyranny Is In Your Future (Ivory Coast) responds to \nanother user's post by stating \"Laying guilt trips on those who see through your gay \nagenda may work on some, but I'm not one of them. Words like bigoted and pathetic are \nnothing more than that - words.\" These users suggest LGBTQ individuals, by being \nvisible, are violating their personal rights in some way. Likewise, as Tyranny Is In Your \nFuture states, by terming those who voice anti-LGBTQ as \"bigots\", the LGBTQ \ncommunity is also perpetuating the \"gay agenda,\" while simultaneously slandering, or \n\"laying guilt trips on\" those who do not wish to see individuals who do not fit into their \npersonal opinions of acceptable. \nMuch like the arguments made against LGBTQ equality in Idaho in 1994 \ndescribing the promotion of LGBTQ equality as a \"sinister gay agenda\" threatening \nfamilies and children (Blain, 2005, p. 31 ), the \"gay agenda\" also comes up in online \ncomments. Although the term \"gay agenda\" is incredibly common in Yahoo! News \ncomments sections, other users, while not explicitly stating there is a \"gay agenda\" hint to \nsuch an agenda in their comments. For example, Steve (Grammys) responds to a main \nthread post condemning the performance of marriage during an awards show by stating \n\"true . .it's done .. why, because they want all of your kids to be gay and oppose God!!\" \nSimlarly, Commenter (Grammys) writes: \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 57 \nThe goal is revenge and to jail fine punish outlaw any and everyone of any age \nthat disagrees with homosexuality, transsexuals, men in the girls showers, \nbathrooms, etc and vice versa, and kids forced fed homosexual books starting in \nday care, these books will be mandated with no parental notice or input, like \nCalifornia new gender laws, and all states will be forced by courts and judges to \napprove of homosexual marriage like California even when the voters repeatedly \nban it. \nThese commenters argue the LGBTQ community and allies are fighting to rid the world \nof God, turn children \"gay,\" and imprison anyone who disagrees. In fact, the biblical law \nis often cited by Yahoo! commenters as evidence of human rights violations. LGBTQ \nindividuals are framed as violating the laws of God \"defying God\" (Commenter, \nGrammys), opposing God (Steve, Grammys), or answering to God (Holly, Grammys) are \noften cited as reasons to continue discrimination based on God's law. Perhaps these \ncommenters feel, based on their interpretations of \"God's law\" and the Bible, human \nrights for LGBTQ individuals is in opposition to God's law, putting their freedom of \nreligion, in accordance to article 18 of the UDHR (Malik et al., 1948), at risk. \nFurthermore, commenters argue LGBTQ individuals, by gaining human rights, \ngain too much power, arguing LGBTQ people will force a \"homosexual lifestyle\" on the \nmajority, despite the voters' apparent right to pass oppressive laws banning equality. \nThis also implicates Brickell's (2001) discussion of \"special rights,\" suggesting LGBTQ \nindividuals, by being allowed equal rights as the majority, are given the \"special right\" to \navoid a hypothetical majority vote to oppress them. Many commenters suggest an \nagenda to oppress the majority in some form. BashtheBasher (Same-sex couples) states \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 58 \n\"92% are AGAINST the gay agenda. Not the PHONY GLAAD paid advertisements,\" \nwhich blatantly accuses a \"gay agenda,\" but more subtly suggests something of a \nconspiracy theory of falsified statistics which are being used by GLAAD (Gay and \nLesbian Alliance Against Defamation) to push that agenda. In fact, many comments hint \nat conspiracy theories, particularly linked to the \"gay agenda,\" which may be an \ninteresting concept to look at more thoroughly in future research. Commenters seem to \nthink there is a secret yet powerful gay agenda at work, manipulating the American \npublic in some form or another. I would argue there is a \"gay agenda,\" in fact, but one \nfar less sinister; an agenda for equality for the rights of LGBTQ individuals. However, \nmany commenters discuss a \"gay agenda\" which is suppressing the rights of the majority, \nsupporting Meyers' (1994) explanation that gay and lesbians are often portrayed as an \ninsignificant part of the population. \nWhile many argue unequal laws and discrimination are a violation of basic human \nrights of LGBTQ individuals, while others simultaneously argue inclusivity is a violation \nof human rights, still others explicitly state they are against equal rights or equal \nprotection under the law. As cited above, the poster LoveMyFamily (Ivory Coast) states \n\"I'm against Gay rights,\" explicitly opposing equal rights for LGBTQ individuals. \nHowever, though blatantly against \"gay rights,\" LoveMyFamily does support non-\nviolence, which, at the very least, suggests support of one partial \"gay right,\" the right to \nnot be subjected to inhuman treatment, in accordance to article 5 of the UDHR. While I \nargue the withholding of any human right to be cruel, as well as the statement \"I'm \nagainst Gay rights\" to be discursively violent based on its perpetuation of hate and \ninequality, at the same time, this Yahoo! commenter seems to conflate \"gay rights\" with \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 59 \nmarriage equality. Moreover, other commenters argue there already are equal rights and \nequal protection under the law, which suggests, as Brickell (2001) describes, the \"gay \nrights\" movement is perceived as seeking \"special rights.\" For example, a Yahoo! poster \nusing the usemame Liberals Destroy (Same-sex Couples) states \"marriage equality is \nalready a reality. everyone has equal rights to marry someone of the opposite sex,\" thus \narguing marriage equality means being able to choose only someone of the \"opposite \nsex\" as a possible partner. The addition to marriage also including same-sex marriage, \nthen, would be considered \"special rights,\" as, according to Liberals Destroy, LGBTQ \nindividuals already have \"equal rights to marry someone of the opposite sex.\" \nWhile many LGBTQ-supporters point out the similarities between homophobic \nprejudice, racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination, arguing LGBTQ individuals \nshould have the same basic human rights as anyone else, others argue otherwise. For \nexample, one commenter posts \"rights for african americans is the way it should be .The \npervert rights is another story\" (rick, Ivory Coast). Discrimination of marginalized \ngroups is never acceptable, yet there is disconnect between LGBTQ rights and the rights \nof everyone else. \"Gay rights\" are somehow seen as different than the rights of anyone \nelse, which certainly constitutes \"othering\" of LGBTQ people. In the discussion of \nhuman rights, some argue the rights of certain individuals, depending on perspective, are \nbeing hindered, others argue there is already equality (at least in the United States), while \nothers argue some groups of people are unworthy of rights. Although those arguing for \nand against LGBTQ equality argue a variety of points, basic human rights and legality \nremain a core theme throughout. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 60 \nPerversion \nIn addition to commenters pointing out human rights violations, often taking \nliberties with their arguments in interesting, embellished and creative ways, others equate \nLGBTQ individuals with pedophiles, bestiality, or simply \"perverts\". Commenters \nsuggest by choosing a same-sex romantic relationship, LGBTQ individuals are violating \nnature in a perversion of the natural, sometimes framed as Godly, order of the world. \nSome point to religious beliefs as evidence of the LGBTQ community by arguing certain \nlifestyles are \"unnatural\" and against God, tying in to rights and law violations as, in this \npoint of view, the LGBTQ community has violated God's law. Others state, quite \nsimply, LGBTQ individuals are \"gross,\" which for these commenters, seems to be \nargument enough. Regardless of framing, by making judgments about the \"natural,\" \njudgments are made through the perceptions of\"deviant bodies.\" Urla and Terry (1995) \ndescribe many \"deviant bodies,'' many of which are \"othered\" due to their deviance. \nIncluded in their list of \"deviant bodies\" are the homosexual body, the \"sex-addicted \nbody,'' the infertile body, and the HIV-infected body (p. 5). Each of these deviant bodies \nshows up in \"othering\" statements in online comments. Commenters argue the \nhomosexual body is \"diseased,'' often bringing up arguments about HIV or AIDS. \nFurthermore, arguments are put forth about the \"unnaturalness\" of sex for purposes other \nthan procreation, tying into \"the infertile body\". Likewise, LGBTQ people are often \nframed as sexual perverts. Urla and Terry's (1995) discussion of deviant bodies certainly \napplies in a discussion about perceived perversion and the \"unnatural\" regarding LGBTQ \nindividuals. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 61 \nA very thorough and detailed argument which details the \"unnatural\" argument is \nas follows: \nI think a lot of you homosexuals really don't understand the difference between \nhate and non-acceptance. Just like we don't want to have to be exposed to \nsomebody deficating in the park, we don't want our children and ourselves to be \nexposed to things which are gross and unnatural. This is simply common sense. I \nknow you want to make all sorts of justifications and call people high school \nnames to try and elevate yourselves, but at some point in your life you have to try \nand come to terms with the fact that you are not an animal. Human beings have \nthe capability to make good moral judgements, not do whatever your groin tells \nyou to do. And yes, this is TOTALLY about sex, because I have lifelong friends \nof the same sex whom I love as a human being, but I have the wisdom, maturity, \nand self-control to not try and get into their pants. You guys try and run away \nfrom the fact that homosexual means SEXUAL attraction to the same sex. Not \nlove, not marriage, it is a groin thing. That is why so many people are turned off \nby your choices and your behavior. Its ok to make bad choices now and then, but \nwhat makes us all human is our ability to differentiate right vs wrong, and natural \nvs unnatural. Immorality is a very slippery slope (Logic2013, Grarnrnys turn mass \nwedding). \nThis comment has many implications. Obviously, there are issues of incivility by \ncomparing LGBTQ individuals to people who defecate in parks. Furthermore, the \ncomment \"others\" by casting LGBTQ people as different, immoral, and unnatural. \nMoreover, this argument not only states LGBTQ individuals are unnatural, but also \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 62 \nsuggests, perhaps unintentionally, that all sexual attraction is unnatural, \"a groin thing,\" \ntying back to the emphasis on the \"homosexual body\" described by Terry (1995). By \npointing out sexual attraction and feelings of love are disconnected, the user also creates \na disconnect between heterosexual relationships and sex. If \"homosexual means \nSEXUAL attraction to the same sex,'' then we can reasonably assume heterosexual means \nsexual attraction to a different sex. Is one really all that different than the other? While \nthis commenter may say there is a difference, his or her argument does not make that \ndistinction. \nMany of these arguments, in addition to instances of \"othering,\" by casting \nLGBTQ individuals as perverted and inferior also tend to be some of the more blatantly \nuncivil discussions and comments. For example, Brian (Grammys) posts: \nWhy stop with gay, might as well sue for equal protection. I should be able to \nmarry my sister, three wives, a chicken, preteen girl, whatever. It doesn't matter, \nas long as you \"love\" someone/something. Heck, there is a guy on tv having \nrelations with his car. Let hime marry that Mustang, he \"feels\" the love. What a \ncountry, whatever, whenever, however. Never saying something is wrong, wow. \nThen we wonder why we have little creeps shooting up schools, malls, etc. \nWhatever makes you \"feel\" good at the time, no matter the outcome. Keep up the \ngood work, demoncrats, you will destroy this country, and mankind. \nThis particular, uncivil comment is exemplary of not only the common description of \nLGBTQ individuals as perverted or \"unnatural,'' but also pertains to the common uncivil \ndiscussions involving politics ( demonization of liberals by conservatives or conservatives \nby liberals) in general, which may be an area of focus for future research. Brian conflates \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 63 \nsame-sex love with non-consensual or incestual \"relations\". Brian's post then goes one \nstep further by equating LGBTQ individuals to school or mall shootings. This statement \nties back to Sobieraj and Berry's (2011) incivility via outrage, as this conflation is a very \nobvious example of exaggeration, arguing by supporting LGBTQ rights, Democrats will \nultimately \"destroy this country, and mankind.\" However, the conflation of LGBTQ \npeople to pedophiles, rapists and perverts was not unique to one commenter. \nMany commenters equate LGBTQ individuals, particularly, but not exclusively, \ngay men, to pedophiles. Hall et al. (1996) indicate \"the relations between adults and \nchildren\" (p. 375) are often brought up in discussions of sexuality. This is certainly true \nin Yahoo! News comments, as many commenters compare LGBTQ individuals to or \naccuse LGBTQ individuals of pedophilia. While these discussions tend to fall more in \nline with the perversion theme in Yahoo! comments, this argument also ties into \ndiscussions of human rights violations of children, discussed above, as pedophilia is, \nobviously, a violation of a child's rights. However, the inaccurate, unjust linkage \nbetween LGBTQ individuals and pedophiles is obviously problematic, but prevalent \nthroughout the comments on LGBTQ-related news discussion on Yahoo! One such \ncommenter, WildBill (Grammys) states \"Legalize#$%$, pedophilia? Oh wait, same \nfolks who pushed the gay right agenda arer pushing for lowering the age of consent ... So \nyeah ... \" Similarly, Lynn (Ivory Coast), offers the following \"stats\" in her or his post: \nmother engaging In lesbian sex acts with her 3 year old daughter. Men adopting \nfamilies to \"help\" them while molesting several young boys. The priesthood, Jerry \nSandusky. When you molest a child of the same sex, you are at the lest bi-sexual \nand as I have found in my 3 5 years of rather a lot of pedophiles that are gay or bi \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 64 \nin proportion to the population. 3%. Further, these crimes are usually handled by \nchild protective services and not given to the Sherriff s office unless criminal \ncharges would occur. \nWhile somewhat difficult to follow, one thing which makes this comment particularly \nintriguing is they appear to be based solely off of some type of experience rather than \ngeneralizable statistics. However, this comment shows a dedication to the belief LGBTQ \nindividuals are often pedophiles, which is reinforced throughout the comments of these \nYahoo! News articles. Lane and McCourt (2013) mention politeness is not synonymous \nwith civility necessarily because ethics also come into play. While many commenters, \nsuch as Lynn quoted above, use \"statistics\" or logical appeals to validate their claims \nequating pedophilia with gay men or lesbian women in a systematic, almost polite way. \nHowever, incivility, as the research shows, is not limited to cursing and blatant hate \nmessages. Equating LGBTQ individuals to pedophiles is an example of incivility. \nInterestingly, this particular theme was clear to some commenters as well. \nApocolOid (Grammys) writes in response to Brian's comment, quoted above: \nThere is a sincere lack of a) logic, b) politeness, and c) understanding on this \nboard. Let's review the opinions: Most say gays are freaks and equate their actions \nto zoophelia, pedophelia, and incest, which they do not equate to, if you think \nabout it for a second, and others are defending the sacred nature of marriage, \nwhich hasn't been 'sacred' since divorce became legal. .. And I'll be thumbsed-\ndown heavily for this, and I don't care. Homosexuality is not the same as \nPedophelia (which is damaging to children in every way possible) Zoophelia \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS \n(which is illegal because animals cannot consent) and incest (which is wrong \nbecause it causes genetic defects). These are the facts, people. \n65 \nThis commenter recognizes the inaccuracy of the common assumption gay men are \npedophiles, while also problematizing the common linking of LGBTQ individuals to \nbestiality, as also discussed by Reddy's (2002) study of discourse in southern Africa, as \nwell as the discursive link between LGBTQ individuals and incestual intercourse. \nHowever rational this argument may be, once again the conversation eventually turned \nvery uncivil. This particular discussion ended with T.S. (Grammys) saying to another \ncommenter, \"Jerry mike b has been swallowing since he started posting here. I have \nnever known any straight guy that obsesses so much about #$%$. He's not normal, I'd say \nperverted.\" Once again, the thread evolves into incivility, fitting Johnson, Cooper, and \nChin's (2008) definition of flaming. As previous research on anonymous internet posting \nsuggests, there are benefits to providing a space for the public to discuss current issues. \nYet, online news comment boards, or at least Yahoo! News comment boards, are clearly \nnot the place for thoughtful discussion on LGBTQ-related news. \nIn addition to labeling LGBTQ individuals as \"unnatural perverts,\" some \ncommenters rationalize this conflation, often taking liberties with generalizations and \nassumptions. For example, John (Grammys) writes, \"Homosexuals were raped by an \nAdult Relative during Childhood. That's what makes Them tum into Perverts. Its been \nproven many times.\" John points to an arguably \"unnatural\" act, the rape of a child, as \nthe cause of \"perversion,\" suggesting empirical evidence for this claim. Likewise, martin \n(Grammys) posts: \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 66 \nOne gay 'man' who is a top has to service 9 gay 'men' who are bottoms Why? \nBecause nature is supreme. It goes to show that man and man sex is unnatural \nand perverted.You see many gay man so called relationship is in a total wreck as \ntheir top partner sneak out to service the other 9 gay men who have no partner. \nAlthough somewhat incoherent, this statement directly points to gay men in particular as \n\"unnatural,\" and thus different. Furthermore, this comment delegitimizes gay men's \nrelationships by the phrasing \"so called\" in a form of \"othering.\" As Hall (1997) notes, \nby framing difference as morally wrong, or in this case, unnatural and against nature (a \nperversion), this particular commenter is casting gay men as the \"other\". This \ncommenter, martin, goes on to respond to another Yahoo! commenter's post by stating \n\"gays are really scary,\" further ostracizing and \"othering\" the LGBTQ community. \nGender Ideologies Exposed \nWilchins (2004) tells us the opposition to the gay rights movement is deeply \nconnected to gender and the fear of gender role violations. This fear of gender role \nviolations is closely associated with \"othering,\" particularly the \"othering\" of women, in \naddition to the \"othering\" of LGBTQ individuals. The fear of violating gender roles \nimplies difference (i.e. failing to conform to gender roles) as inferior, fitting Krumer-\nNevo and Sidi's (2012) definition of \"othering\" as \"the process of attaching moral codes \nand inferiority to difference\" (p. 300). As Wilchins would expect, gender was a clear \ntheme in Yahoo! News comments. Some commenters also take note of the connection \nbetween homophobia and sexism. For example, mt (Grammys) states, \"I mean what \nmakes you better in REALITY that you believe that you are even above a gay man or \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 67 \nwoman?\" In this section, I discuss the connection between homophobia and sexism, as is \nevident in the sampled Yahoo! News comments. \nIn these comments, many commenters discussed same-sex couples as parents. \nMany believed lesbian or gay parents were equal if not superior as parents, however, \nwhich was particularly expressed in Richey's (2014) news article which reported on the \nchallenging of the same-sex marriage ban in Florida. However, across multiple news \ncomments, lesbian or gay parents were vilified. Additionally, commenters often equated \ngay men to women, while lesbian women were described as men or acting \"the male \narchetype\" (Corporate WelfareRuined AMERICA, Grammys). Furthermore, many \nhomophobic comments are also generally sexist. \nParenting and marriage were polarizing issues in these comments. Commenters \nsuggest relationships and marriage are essentially for procreation purposes. For example, \nzena girl (Grammys) states, \"the bible also tells man to love is wife as Christ love the \nchurch. He didn't say love the other man or woman. He said husband and wife. Men were \nmeant to be the husband and women the wife. Men can't bare children so you fix that \none.\" This comment perpetuates the notion relationships exist only to create babies. \nMoreover, there is an assumption a child needs both a mother and a father in order to \nbecome a well-adjusted adult. This assumption ties into the \"right\" of a child to have a \nmother and father, which I discuss in the human rights section above. However, this \nsentiment assumes, then, that if a mother and father are both needed in order for a child to \nthrive, then men and women provide different things to a child which the other cannot. \nFurthermore, there is a sentiment by some commenters that not only would \nlesbian or gay parents be unfit to raise a child themselves, but the stigma of society is also \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 68 \na consideration. In response to Shields' (2014) article describing Austria overturning a \npreviously held ban which prevented lesbian couples from using sperm donations, dromia \ncomments, \"the injustice is not having awareness or educated prowess to know the \nrepercussions these children will be facing in an ever increasingly violent intolerant \nworld for the selfish egotism of just one or two extremists.\" While this comment doesn't \ndirectly implicate gender, it does raise the question: To what extent should parents \nconsider societal regulations and expectations? Should interracial couples also not have \nchildren so as to avoid stigma? This is an argument that I, for one, have never heard! \nThe fact that this argument is made about lesbian or gay parents other than other parents \nwho may be viewed as \"non-traditional\" suggests the social regulations regarding gender \nand parenting are especially stigmatized. \nMany of the comments from this sample perpetuate the male/female gender \nbinary. In fact, many of the comments implicating gender ideologies conflate gender and \nsex, which may contribute to acceptance of the gender binary. Moreover, both supporters \nand opponents of LGBTQ equality perpetuate this binary. For example, Crowsticks \n(Same-sex marriage), who defends LGBTQ individuals in multiple comments, states \"it \ndoesn't matter if you're having sex with the same gender or the opposite.\" This assumes \nthere are only two genders: one and an opposite. Furthermore, the comment supposes \nthese two genders are opposite each other. Men are opposite of women. Therefore, by \nthis logic, not only are there only two gender, but they are completely and utterly unlike \neach other; they are opposites. Obviously, this assumption easily perpetuates the notion \nof inequality between men and women. Furthermore, For The Love Of God ( Grammys) \nstates, \"homosexuality is vile, heinous, unnatural and unproductive. It is also a lie as \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 69 \npersons pretend to be a gender that they were not created to be.\" This comment conflates \ngender and sex. Because gender is socially constructed, while sex is biological, then one \nwould be \"created,\" whether that be by a god or otherwise, as a particular sex, with \ngender being socially constructed after birth. \nHowever, the argument condemning gay and lesbian parents did not go \nunchallenged. A commenter called blacksockslover (Same-sex couples) states: \nGay parents \"tend to be more motivated, more committed than heterosexual \nparents on average, because they chose to be parents,\" said Abbie Goldberg, a \npsychologist at Clark University in Massachusetts who researches gay and lesbian \nparenting. Gays and lesbians rarely become parents by accident, compared with \nan almost 50 percent accidental pregnancy rate among heterosexuals, Goldberg \nsaid. \"That translates to greater commitment on average and more involvement.\" \nThough many suggest men and women bring different parenting roles to child-rearing, \nboth of which are vitally important, this argument, which cited research, draws attention \nto some benefits of gay and lesbian couples raising children. Unfortunately, however, the \ncomment does not address the problematic assumptions about gender, biology, and nature \nwhich are so prevalent in these comments. \nAs Wilchins (2004) points out, homophobia and sexism overlap frequently, \nsuggesting those who antagonize LGBTQ people, at a basic level, fear the abandonment \nof accepted gender roles. An excellent example of this is Logic2013's (Grammys) \ncomment: \"And it is good to preserve your son's masulinity by not showing him \nperverted garbage.\" This comment directly implicates LGBTQ individuals as a threat to \nthe socially acceptable version of masculinity. There are numerous other examples of \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 70 \ncomments in this data that are both sexist and homophobic. For example, shawn \ncomments,\" that is really #$%$tastic I think its sick for any one to want the same sex . its \nall a sickness in the brain and that's all it is. god gave man a woman not another man.\" \nThis sexist and homophobic comment clearly implicates a woman's role by directly \nstating women were created/or men, which is obviously problematic. \nCommenters make many assumptions about gender, often assuming gender is an \ninherent trait, rather than socialized, while simultaneously making general claims about \nthe roles and traits of men and women. For example, Crowsticks (Same-sex marriage) \nstates, \"men are sex driven machines,\" which perpetuates a notion of men having a higher \nbiological sex drive than women. This ignores the possibility men are socialized in a way \nin which expressing sexuality is more acceptable than for women, who may be slut-\nshamed if perceived as behaving promiscuous or in any way embracing sexuality. Many \nof these comments ignore social construction, focusing heavily on the \"natural,\" \n\"biological,\" or the inherent. \nAs I stated at the start of this analysis, none of these categorical themes stand \nalone. Each theme has implications in the others. Gender ideologies are prevalent in \ndiscussions of both human rights and perversion related to the LGBTQ community. By \nsuggesting LGBTQ people are undeserving of rights or perverted, these commenters are \nmaking a statement about violating gender roles. If a person does not fit into the very \nstereotyped role of \"male\" or \"female,\" they become socially ostracized; they are \n\"othered.\" Moreover, Liberals Destroy's (Same-sex Couples) comment, also quoted \nabove, states \"marriage equality is already a reality. everyone has equal rights to marry \nsomeone of the opposite sex.\" This comment is also an example of gender ideologies, in \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 71 \naddition to human rights, as it suggests marrying \"someone of the opposite sex\" is so \ndifferent than same-sex marriage that one is a human right, a right everyone has access \nto, while the other is not. This certainly has gendered expectations in the roles in \nrelationships. What is it about a same-sex relationship that is different enough to warrant \nbecoming legally regulated? Heteronormativity is so ingrained in the way relationships \nare perceived largely because of gendered assumptions of male and female roles. \nFurthermore, the conflation of LGBTQ individuals to perverts or pedophiles is \nalso tied directly to gendered assumptions. For example, Bobby (Ivory Coast) states \n\"Equating pedophiles with homosexuality is as vile as equation pedophilic behavior with \ngirls with heterosexuality.\" Although this commenter points out the problematic \nconflation of gay men and pedophiles, this commenter nevertheless, perpetuates \nhomophobic discourses by suggesting a difference between pedophiles who abuse young \nboys and those who abuse young girls. Through this comment, Bobby, perhaps \nunintentionally, connects gay men with sex with young boys, and the \"heterosexual\" \npedophiles are those who sexually abuse young girls. Once again, a dichotomized view \nof gender and sexuality is perpetuated. Therefore, as is often the case, even those who \nattempt to disrupt homophobia in online comments ultimately perpetuate homophobic \nassumptions. \nAs Hall et al. (1996) note \"the relations between men and women, the problem of \nsexual deviance, the question of family and other relationships, the relations between \nadults and children, and the issue of difference\" (p. 375) are each common themes in \ndiscussions of sexuality. The relations between men and women, as well as discussions \nof what constitutes a man and a woman often come up in gendered and uncivil \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 72 \ndiscussions of the LGBTQ community. Similarly, the problem of sexual deviance and \nthe relations between adults and children comes up often through the comparison of \nLGBTQ individuals to perverts or pedophiles. Likewise, the family and other \nrelationship are also brought up often, particularly relating to assumptions about gay and \nlesbian couple's ability to parent, for example. Finally, a vast majority of the comments \nrelate to Hall et al.' s \"issue of difference,\" as many of the comments isolate and \"other\" \ndifferences which have been communicatively defined as significant. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 73 \nDiscussion and Conclusions \nIn this section, I discuss each of the themes discussed in the previous chapter \nmore holistically, as well as consider the above analysis in relation to each research \nquestion. I also make conclusions about the usefulness and civility of online news \ndiscussion boards, specifically considering if online news comment boards are useful for \ngiving the public a voice in a civil and appropriate way. Finally, I discuss limitations of \nthis study, as well as provide suggestions for future research. \nThemes and Research Questions \nSeveral clear and distinct themes arose from the data used in this analysis: human \nrights/law, perversion, and gender. Human rights are discussed throughout the \ncomments, regardless of the Yahoo! commenter's position on LGBTQ rights. Supporters \nand opponents of equality for LGBTQ individuals bring up issues of basic human rights \nin support of their arguments. Those voicing support for the LGBTQ community argue \nunequal rights, particularly marriage rights, are a violation of human rights. Likewise, \nmany Yahoo! News posters argue unequal marriage rights in the United States is \nunconstitutional or else ought to be illegal due to discrimination. Alternatively, other \ncommenters cite human rights/law to support arguments against equality. Many argued \nthe inclusion of LGBTQ individuals in media is a violation of majority rights, stating that \nincluding LGBTQ individuals forces society to see or hear about LGBTQ individuals, \nwhich is further evidence of the heterosexism and heteronormativity which pervades our \nsociety. Moreover, commenters also argued the United States has violated the human \nrights of other nations by supporting LGBTQ equality, and others argued LGBTQ \nindividuals already have achieved equality already, specifically in the U.S. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 74 \nIn addition to human rights, commenters also equate LGBTQ individuals with \n\"perverts.\" LGBTQ individuals are often labeled pedophiles, or simply \"perverts,\" or \nelse compared to those who engage in bestiality. Commenters suggest choosing a same-\nsex romantic relationship violates nature. This is framed as a perversion of the natural \norder of the world, and often tied to a perversion of \"God's law\". Many point to religious \nbeliefs as evidence, arguing certain lifestyles are \"unnatural\" and against God. Many of \nthe comments incorporating religious arguments draw from ideologies from those \npracticing fundamentalist Christianity. For example, the Westboro Baptist Church \n(2014), or WBC, known for their protests of funerals and general incivility towards the \nLGBTQ community, states on the \"About Us\" section of their website, \"WBC engages in \ndaily peaceful sidewalk demonstrations opposing the homosexual lifestyle of soul-\ndamning, nation-destroying filth\" (para. 2). Others simply state LGBTQ individuals are \n\"gross,'' which these commenters suggest to be reason enough for discrimination. \nFinally, as Wilchins (2004) describes, oppressive comments against LGBTQ \nindividuals are often tied closely to fear of gender role violations. Many commenters \nimplicate gender by suggesting marriage or parenting be restricted to one man (father) \nand one woman (mother). Commenters argue men and women bring different elements \nto relationships and parenting, suggesting a division between the role of a woman and the \nrole of a man. Furthermore, many heterosexist comments are also generally sexist, \nperpetuating ideologies which are oppressive to both LGBTQ individuals as well as \nwomen. \nCertain sub-themes were more common in the comments of some news articles \nthan others. For example, discussion ofLGBTQ individuals in the media as a violation \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 75 \nof the rights of those who wish not to see them was more commonly found in the Yahoo! \nNews article reporting on marriages at the Grammys (2014) than the other articles. \nLikewise, in the comments section under the article in which same-sex marriage in \nFlorida was discussed, comments problematizing parenting by lesbian and gay parents \nwas most common. Although certain sub-themes tended to appear more often in \ncomments of particular news stories, the overarching themes of human rights, perversion, \nand gender violations were common among numerous news articles and comment \nthreads. These particularly sort of talking points are typical justifications for the \ndiscrimination of LGBTQ people, and are therefore noteworthy. Based on the incivility \nand \"othering\" of the LGBTQ community, as well as the legal and legitimized \ndiscrimination LGBTQ individuals face not just in the U.S., but worldwide, these themes \nare important to understand, if for no other reason, so discriminatory arguments may be \ndebunked. \nThese posts are often ridiculous, but are surprisingly similar to the arguments that \nhave created legal and blatant discrimination against LGBTQ people not only in the U.S., \nbut also around the world. While these comments may seem very isolated; they are \nburied in Yahoo! News discussion boards which may eventually be deleted, or else never \nread again, they back up discriminatory practices, such as marriage inequality in the U.S. \n(Richey, 2014), or violence against LGBTQ individuals and organizations in the Ivory \nCoast (Corey-Boulet, 2014). \nFinally, it is important to note most comments did not fit cleanly into only one of \nthe three main categories. Many comments implicate multiple themes, and each theme \nimplicates each of the others. For example, gender ideologies are prevalent in \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 76 \ndiscussions of both human rights and perversion related to the LGBTQ community. By \nsuggesting LGBTQ people are undeserving of rights or perverted, these commenters are \nmaking a statement about violating gender roles. If a person does not fit into the very \nstereotyped role of \"male\" or \"female,\" they become \"othered\" by the majority. \nTherefore, many commenters make the argument that violating gender roles is a \nperversion of nature. Furthermore, these arguments are often conducted in a very uncivil \nmanner, which I discuss in greater detail regarding my second research question. Next, I \ndiscuss each of my research questions in relation to my findings. \nResearch question one. My analysis answered the research questions I used to \nguide my research in several ways. I start with my first research question: In what ways \ndo online comments perpetuate and reinforce homophobia? The online commenters who \nresponded to LGBTQ-related news stories perpetuated homophobia through the creation \nof the themes detailed above. As Brickell (2001) points out, \"gay rights\" tend to be \nconsidered \"special rights,\" rather than human rights. This sentiment was most certainly \nperpetuated in the online comments in this analysis. Moreover, others argued LGBTQ \nindividuals already have equal human rights, reinforcing a homophobic, heteronormative \nstatus quo. \nMoreover, homophobia is also perpetuated in the comments sections of Yahoo! \nNews through the problematic equating ofLGBTQ individuals with perverts or \npedophiles. Gay men in particular were equated with pedophiles in this data. For \nexample, as I describe in the analysis above, Bobby (Ivory Coast) states \"Equating \npedophiles with homosexuality is as vile as equation pedophilic behavior with girls with \nheterosexuality.\" Although this commenter is attempting to point out the problematic \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 77 \nconflation of gay men and pedophiles, Bobby nevertheless, perpetuates homophobia by \ncreating a difference between pedophiles who abuse young boys, with those who abuse \nyoung girls. Bobby, through this comment, connects gay men with sex with young boys, \nand the \"heterosexual\" pedophiles are those who sexually abuse young girls. Therefore, \neven those who attempt to disrupt homophobia in online comments ultimately perpetuate \nhomophobic assumptions. \nFinally, homophobia is reinforced in online comments through the perpetuation of \ngendered assumptions. Jagose (1996) points out that while gender and sexuality are \ndistinctly different, there are ties between the two which cannot be ignored. Foucault \n(1990) has established it is those in power who decide what constitutes an area of inquiry. \nSimilarly, those in power have conflated gender and sexuality to the extent gender norm \nviolations are read as indicators of sexuality. \nResearch question two. In what ways do incivility and homophobia work \ntogether in internet comments? As I discuss in more detail below, many potentially \nthought-provoking discussions of sexuality and gender are ultimately destroyed through \nthe uncivil communication climate constructed in Yahoo! News comments. Many \ncommenters post hateful, illogical, or \"flaming\" posts. For example, Coyote (Same-sex \ncouples) states \"my dog was gay ,so I shot it as I dont like those GAY DOGS.\" This \ncomment is a distinct example of incivility and homophobia working together. \nUnfortunately, comments similar to Coyote's are not uncommon in the Yahoo! News \ncomments. If Yahoo! News comments sections are designed to create thoughtful and \ncivil discussion about news stories, they are not fulfilling that purpose. Therefore, \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 78 \nincivility and homophobia work together to reinforce and perpetuate the \"othering\" of the \nLGBTQ community. \nArnett (2001) describes a civil society as one which creates a space for diverse \nstandpoints. The comments posted on Yahoo! News do not create such as space. \nAlthough many commenters do disagree with each other, these disagreements are not \ndiscussed in a way which facilitates rational and thoughtful discussion. Lane and \nMcCourt (2013) write ethics, politeness, and the incorporation of social norms are each \ncomponents of civility. Instead, Yahoo! News comments are wrought with hate, \n\"trolling,\" and overall incivility to those who do not fit into stereotypical, dichotomized \ngender roles. \nResearch question three. What are the connections between homophobic \ncomments and oppressive gender ideologies? In this analysis, gender ideologies are \ncommon in the discussions of both human rights and perversion related to LGBTQ \nindividuals. Wilchins (2004) writes gender norm violations are strongly associated with \nassumptions about sexuality. Although Sedgwick (1990) has pointed out the connection \nbetween sexuality and gender is an arbitrary one, this conflation continues to act as an \noppressive force. Commenters who suggest LGBTQ individuals are undeserving ofrights \nor perverted are perpetuating oppressive ideologies about the violation of gender roles. \nThose who do not fit neatly in the stereotyped and oppressive binary of \"male\" or \n\"female\" are viewed as abnormal, and such cast as the \"other.\" \nFurthermore, gender ideologies become clear in homophobic comments which \nsuggest lesbian or gay couples are unequal to heterosexual couples, or are unable or unfit \nto raise children. Once again, this perspective exposes a heteronormative ideological \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 79 \nassumption that men and women are inherently different, thus bring different roles to \nrelationships and parenting. There is nothing about same-sex relationships that are so \ndifferent as to warrant legal regulation, yet many commenters argue in support of \ngovernment laws being imposed to regulate relationship and sexuality based on gender. \nHeteronormativity is so ingrained in the way relationships are perceived largely because \nof gendered assumptions of male and female roles. \nCivility and Online Discussion Boards \nAlthough comments boards, according to previous research, are meant to give a \nvoice to readers and facilitate discussion and reader-feedback, the utilization of these \nforums, at least on Yahoo! News, leaves much to be desired. The following is an \nexample of a comment thread, beginning with Max's (Same-sex marriage) main \ncomment discussing human rights and law: \nMax: The Courts here will hopefully come to appreciate the reality that \nmillions of Americans already do: \n1. Same sex marriage greatly benefits same sex couples and their \nfamilies. \n2. Same sex marriage harms no one. \n3. Banning same sex marriage benefits no one. \nPrimewonk: Go suck your MOTHERS balls Maxene. BTW Your mother \nswallows. LOSER \nMax: @Prime. They say conservatives are less educated. You appear to \nvalidate that point. \nSafe Sex: @Max you wouldnt know the difference LOSER \nSafe Sex: BTW Maxines MOTHER swallows \nEdward: GO TO THE FED'S ! \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 80 \nRas: #$%$ \nOlga: Ah, more intelligent rhetoric from the ignorant bigots, LOLOL \nWhat started as a relatively well reasoned, civil comment quickly turned to something \nuncivil, off topic, and utterly useless to civil conversation. Laineste (2013) states \n\"aggression targeted at fellow commenters is more frequent towards the end of the \nthread\" (p. 36). Although, as can be seen from Max's original comment, civil, thoughtful \ncomments can and are sometimes made on the Yahoo! comments board, they are rare, \nand generally not responded to in a way that is conducive to a civil, reasonable \ndiscussion. Incivility and \"othering\" is rampant in the discussion boards of Yahoo! News \narticles pertaining to LGBTQ news stories. While much previous research has, in part, \ndiscussed the benefits of anonymous online discussions, the discussions occurring here \nare not the thoughtful, civil, production discussions which previous research has \nendorsed. As Hlavach and Freivogel (2011) point out, when comments become uncivil \nand discourteous, many readers, perhaps those who could maintain a civil and productive \ndialogue, avoid commenting. This may create a spiral of incivility, attracting more \nflamers while repelling those who would create a well-thought, civil argument worthy of \npublic discussion. Many commenters appear to intentionally \"troll\" the board, and even \nthose commenters who appear at first to attempt a thoughtful discussion eventually \ndisappear, or engage in name-calling and incivility by the end of the thread discussion, as \nLaineste (2013) predicts. Yahoo! commenters are engaging in uncivil, hateful \ndiscussions, rendering the comment board essentially useless to anyone who may desire a \nthoughtful discussion. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 81 \nPerhaps the only practical use of these discussion boards is a study like this one. \nAccording to the Yahoo! (2012) Terms of Service (TOS), Yahoo! users are not to: \nupload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any Content that is \nunlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, \nobscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or \notherwise objectionable (para. 9). \nBased on the comments in this analysis, Yahoo! users do not follow the TOS in their \nposts to comment boards. In this analysis alone, which looked only at some comments \nfrom only five Yahoo! News articles, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, vulgar, \nobscene, and hateful comments were seen, each of which is in violation of the Yahoo! \nTOS. Furthermore, the Yahoo! Terms of Service indicate: \nYahoo may or may not pre-screen Content, but that Yahoo and its designees shall \nhave the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, \nor remove any Content that is available via the Yahoo Services. Without limiting \nthe foregoing, Yahoo and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content \nthat violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable (para. 10). \nThough Yahoo! claims they may pre-screen or remove those comments which violate the \nTOS, the TOS also clearly mentions Yahoo! is not obligated to do so. Perhaps, Yahoo! \nshould reconsider their right to remove hateful comments, and manage these boards \naccording to their own TOS. \nIf Yahoo! News, like many other online newspapers, were to manage these boards \nthrough moderators, if not deleting them all together, hateful discourse could be limited. \nAlthough there is some suggestion, via the comments, that the comments section may be, \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 82 \nin some way, censored, it is unclear whether Yahoo! News, in fact, censors comments. If \nso, the censorship is inadequate and easily manipulated. For example, consider the \nfollowing quotes from Yahoo! commenters: \"J*A*C*K*A*S*S\" and \"the word that was \ncensored: D*O*U*C*H*E* B* A *G\" (T.S., Grammys turn mass wedding), \n\"homOsexuals\" (Ralph, Grammys tum mass wedding), \"Nasty #$%$z!\" Gerry c, \nGrammys tum mass wedding), \"that's a d*mn lie\" (Robin, Ivory Coast), and \"BITCH, did \nyour mom have any children that weren't inbred mOrons like you?\" (Chupacabra, Ivory \nCoast). Each of these quotes shows Yahoo! commenters at least suspect Yahoo! News \ncomments may be censored, but these censors are easily overcome. If those at Yahoo! \nare serious about promoting civility in discussions, they would have active moderators, \nrather than easily fooled, automatic censors. While this would in no way solve bigotry \nand hate towards LGBTQ people, it may provide a more thought-out, civil discussion. In \na nation like the U.S., for example, where new policies towards inclusion or \ndiscrimination are being drafted and reported on every day, a space for a civil, public \ndiscussion could be incredibly valuable! However, Yahoo! News does not provide such a \nspace at this time. As Santana (2011) and Reader (2012) found, online news forums are \nnot conducive of civil discussions. This is especially true of boards, such as Yahoo! \nNews comment boards, which are not moderated. \nLimitations \nAt the time of my data collection, as I mentioned in the methodology section \nabove, news articles which discussed lesbian rights specifically were difficult to find on \nYahoo! News. Lesbians are often rendered invisible in public, as well as political \ndiscourse. Rich (1980) writes, \"lesbians have historically been deprived of a political \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 83 \nexistence through 'inclusion' as female versions of male homosexuality. To equate \nlesbian existence with male homosexuality because each is stigmatized is to erase female \nreality once again\" (p. 648). Though I intentionally sought out at least one article which \ndiscussed lesbian women, Austrian court ends insemination ban for lesbian pairs \n(Shields, 2014), this article only accumulated one comment, and therefore did not have a \nstrong influence on my analysis. Furthermore, though several comments mentioned \nbisexual or transgender individuals, and each news article broadly addressed the entire \nLGBTQ community, a heavy emphasis was placed on gay men in the comments. Jagose \n( 1996) writes \"the mainstream homophile movement's indifference to issues of gender\" \ncreates a \"need to address lesbians specifically instead of subsuming them in the \npurportedly generic category of homosexuality\" (p. 44). This is certainly a weakness of \nthe present study, as lesbians were often not mentioned at all in Yahoo! comments, let \nalong addressed specifically. \nHaugh (2010) suggests \"variability across individuals in regards to their \nevaluations of certain instances of behavior as (im)polite\" (p. 11 ). My analysis is limited \nto my subjective, yet informed, evaluations of what constitutes impolite, uncivil \ncommenting. As the researcher for this analysis, it is impossible to remove myself from \nthe analysis. Furthermore, there is a distinctive lack of communicative cues, as this \nanalysis is driven completely by computer mediated discourse. It is impossible to tell the \nlocation from which comments originate, the poster's gender, age, or any other \nidentifying information other than the time of posting, the language they have posted in, \nand the usemame of the commenter. Therefore the context or intent of the comments is \nambiguous, making the intent of the message difficult to identify. For example, I suspect \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 84 \nseveral of the comments in my data are intended as sarcasm, but often sarcasm is very \ndifficult to read without verbal and nonverbal cues. Similarly, I was limited my study to \nnews articles published on the U.S. version of the Yahoo! News homepage, which may \nhave limited the diversity of the comments. Moreover, due to language constraints, my \nanalysis was also limited to only those comments posted in English. \nFinally, I was limited by time during the course of this analysis. Because this \nstudy was completed in the span of one year for a master's thesis, I collected all of my \ndata within the span of two weeks. Had I collected data over the course of several \nmonths or a year, I may have accumulated a more diverse sample of comments, which \nmay have affected my analysis. \nSuggestions for Future Research \nBecause, as I state above, much of the commentary on Yahoo! News discussed \ngay men, a future research study focusing specifically on lesbian women, bisexual or \ntransgender individuals may provide new insights into heterosexism, specifically \nregarding issues of gender. As Jagose (1996) points out, there is a \"need to address \nlesbians specifically\" (p. 44), which could be a focus in the future. Conducting a similar \nanalysis on this one, though focusing only on news articles which discuss lesbian rights, \nfor example, could be illuminating. Furthermore, a study focusing solely on comments \nregarding lesbian, bisexual, or transgender individuals could create a richer understanding \nof the intersections between heterosexism, homophobia, and sexism in general. \nMany comments, particularly those which discuss a possible \"gay agenda\" \nsuggest various forms of conspiracy theories. For example, Robert (Ivory Coast) states \n\"In the United States, a gay activist went to the Family Research Council with guns and \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 85 \nChick-fil-A sandwiches, with a plan to kill people, shoot them dead, and stuff sandwiches \nin their mouths. The Leftaliban media was okay with this, so they didn't tell anyone. \nSearch Floyd Lee Corkins.\" This quote suggests a media conspiracy in favor of \n\"Leftaliban\" or liberal politics. While certain news organizations certainly have biases, \nRobert suggests this story was intentionally and completely covered up by the media. In \nanother suggested conspiracy theory, Commenter (Grammys) states: \n33 is a symbol that the free masons are pulling the strings. All of our presidents \nwere/are free masons, over 40 of the founding fathers were free masons backed by \nthe big money in Europe like the Rothschild. This was originally meant for the \nsuper bowl, but they will probably just worship Satan during half time again, but \nyou never know. The goal is revenge and to jail fine punish outlaw any and \neveryone of any age that disagrees with homosexuality, transsexuals, men in the \ngirls showers, bathrooms, etc and vice versa, and kids f;:orced fed homosexual \nbooks starting in day care, these books will be mandated with no parental notice \nor input, like California new gender laws, and all states will be forced by courts \nand judges to approve of homosexual marriage like California even when the \nvoters repeatedly ban it. \nThis excerpt from Commenter's post incorporates past U.S. presidents, the Super Bowl, \nSatan, and a \"gay agenda\" all at once. Though comments like the examples above are \nsometimes difficult to follow logically, they are certainly fascinating, and may be \ninteresting to analyze in-depth in future research. \nAdditionally, this study focused specifically on incivility on Yahoo! News articles \ndiscussing LGBTQ-related news items. Future research could consider incivility directed \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO! NEWS COMMENTS 86 \nto the LGBTQ community in other online news media, or in online discussions unrelated \nto specific news stories. Moreover, future research could also look at online news \ncomments on news items considered to be less controversial. It's possible today's more \ncontroversial political talking points, such as same-sex marriage, which is a very current, \nstill-evolving story in the United States as state after state considers, passes, or rejects \nmarriage equality laws, create more uncivil online discussions than news stories which \nare interpreted as more politically neutral. \nFinal Thoughts \nThere is something very wrong with the discriminatory policies in the United \nStates and around the world. The fact Dan Cathy can win an equality award is further \nevidence there is something amuck with the discourse surrounding \"equality\" in regards \nto LGBTQ individuals. Many comments in the sample for this study expressed beliefs \nLGBTQ individuals have achieved equality already, especially in the United States. As a \nsociety, we like to think issues of racism, sexism, and homophobia are behind us, but that \nis simply not the case. Homophobia and hate is alive and well in the United States. This \nis evidenced by leeching ofheteronormativity into every aspect of day-to-day life, from \nblatant discriminatory marriage laws, to comments on an online news article, to a young \ngirl being told she is a \"dyke\" for winning a game of basketball. \nINCIVILITY AND OTHERING IN YAHOO!

    "abstract": "In 2004, many newspapers in the U.S. allowed public commenting on news articles posted to their websites, however since then, many U.S. news websites have removed public comment boards, ceased archiving public comments, or turned to moderators to edit or delete hateful or overly aggressive comments (Hughey and Daniels, 2013). Yahoo!, however, continues to utilize comment boards on Yahoo! News reports, in which incivility continues to run rampant. Utilizing critical discourse analysis, this study addresses incivility and  othering  in Yahoo! News article comment sections from news reporting on LGBTQ-related stories. From a sample of 1000 Yahoo! News comments using open coding, several themes are clear in five news reports from this year. Human rights, perversion, and gender are each themes in comments, many of which perpetuate homophobia and heteronormativity, and promote incivility. I conclude Yahoo! News comments are ultimately ineffective and do not support civil, thoughtful discussion",
