This paper explores strategies used by school boys aged 10-11 to \nsubordinate and position boys at the bottom of the pupil hierarchy.  The findings are \nbased on data gathered from a year long empirical study (between 1998 and 1999) set in \nthree UK junior schools which were differentiated by the social characteristics of their \nintake.  The research emphasises the role of the body in the construction of masculinity. \nThe hegemonic, or most idealised, form of masculinity at each school was constructed \naround activity and, in particular, various forms of embodied physicality/athleticism \n(exemplified through skill, strength, fitness and speed), and boys who did not wish to, or \nwho were unable to, use these resources generally found themselves marginalised and/or \nsubordinated.  Many of the subordinated forms were symbolically assimilated to \nfemininity, and the paper proposes that the main strategies of subordination can be \nsummarised under the generic heading of ‘difference’.  The final section discusses the \npervasive use of homophobia, and concludes that it should be conceptualised in terms of \ngender as well as sex.\nIntroduction\nWhile there have been a number of notable ethnographic studies exploring the \nsubordination of boys (both individually and collectively) in the school setting since the \nlate 1970s [1], many have tended to consider subordinated boys as an adjunct to the more \ndominant groups and patterns of masculinity.  This paper concentrates on subordinated \nforms of masculinity per se.  I set out to detail the strategies used to subordinate \nindividuals and groups of boys in the school setting at three different schools in the UK, \n1\nand to show how dominant types of masculinity classify and position these boys at the \nbottom of the pupil hierarchy.  I highlight the role of the body in subordination, and \npropose that the strategies of subordination can be summarised under the generic heading \nof ‘difference’  For many boys in this subordinated position, their daily experience of \nschool is often highly uncomfortable and distressing, and they often suffer from verbal \nand physical bullying.  This situation can also have adverse effects on academic \nperformance, and is of course by no means limited to schools in the UK.  It is therefore \nimportant for inclusive educators to understand how and why some of the main tactics of \nsubordination are used in order to try and counter them and, indeed, change them.\nTheories of masculinity; subordination; and the importance of peer group status\nThe ongoing construction of boys’ nascent identities at school is essentially an issue \nabout masculinities which are actively produced using the strategies and resources which \nare available in each particular setting (Connell 2000).  Many recent theoretical \nconceptualisations about masculinity have been coherently summarised by Gilbert and \nGilbert (1998) and, along with Connell (1987, 1995, 1996, 2000, 2002), they highlight \nthe inadequacies of sex-roles/socialisation theories, and affirm a number of key points \nfrom recent feminist and feminist-inspired work: masculinity is a relational construct \noccupying a place in gender relations; there are multiple masculinities; there are \nhierarchies of masculinities; masculinity is a precarious and ongoing performance; and it \nis generally a collective social enterprise.\nMasculinity refers to the body, and as the boys’ identities are defined and generally \ndescribed in terms of what they do with/to their bodies, I have embraced the concept of \nembodiment (Turner 2000).  Although there are a number of ways of defining \nembodiment it needs to be understood as a social process (Elias 1978).  Although bodies \nare located in particular social, historical structures and spaces, the boys in this study are \nviewed as embodied social agents, for they do not merely have a passive body which is \ninscribed and acted upon, but they are actively involved in the development of their \n2\nbodies, using it as a resource throughout their school life (and indeed for their entire life-\nspan).  The boys experience themselves simultaneously in and as their bodies (Lyon and \nBarbalet 1994:54) and in this respect they are bodies (Turner 2000).  The body is thus an \nintegral part of identity and of their biographies, for the process of making and becoming \na body also involves the project of making their self (Shilling 1993, Synott1993).\nWithin the hierarchies of masculinity, each setting (such as a school) will generally have \nits own dominant, or hegemonic, form.  Although this may differ in each school, it gains \nascendancy over and above others, becomes ‘culturally exalted’ (Connell 1995: 77), and \nexemplifies what it means to be a real boy.  The hegemonic masculine form is not \nnecessarily the most common type on view and may be contested.  Although it is often \nunderwritten by the threat of violence, it generally exerts its influence by being able to \ndefine what is the norm and many boys find that they have to fit into, and conform to, its \ndemands.  While there may be other types of masculinity which do not aspire to emulate \nthe leading form, other forms will be marginalised and subordinated.  This paper looks \nspecifically at these subordinate modes of masculinity which are positioned outside the \nlegitimate forms of maleness, as represented in the hegemonic form, and which are \ncontrolled, oppressed and subjugated.  Said (1995) argues that patterns of subordination \nare actually inevitable as each historical age and society requires the existence of another \nand competing alter ego, and so will create and recreate ‘others’.  Within any given \nsociety (including the micro cultural milieu of the peer group) the construction of identity \nis bound up with the disposition of power which is embodied in the norm, and powerless \nwhich is embodied in the different.  As all masculinities are constructed in contrast to \nbeing feminine those which are positioned at the bottom of the masculine hierarchy will \nbe symbolically assimilated to femininity and tend to have much in common with \nfeminine forms (Kenway et al. 1997, Gilbert and Gilbert 1998, Connell 2000, Skelton \n2001).  As with the other forms of masculinity at the schools in this study, there were \nsimilarities and differences between the subordinated types which were contingent to \neach school.  However I wish to argue that the strategies of subordination across all three \nschools were constructed under the  generic heading of ‘difference’.\n3\nOne of the most important features of the school setting is the informal life of the pupil \npeer group.  It has a fundamental influence on the construction of masculine identities, \nand there are constant pressures on individuals to perform and behave to the expected \ngroup norms (see, for example, Pollard 1985, Woods 1990, Mac an Ghaill 1994, Kenway \net al. 1997, Adler and Adler 1998, Connolly 1998, Gilbert and Gilbert 1998, Harris 1998, \nWalker 1998, Connell 2000).  Each peer group has its own cultural identity which can be \nsaid to refer to a ‘way of life’ (Dubbs and Whitney 1980: 27) with shared values and \ninterests, providing boys with a series of collective meanings of what it is to be a boy. \nHarris (1998) argues that the peer group actually has more influence on children than \ntheir parents in the formation of their identity, of who they are now, and who they will \nbecome, and is the main conduit by which cultures are passed from one generation to \nanother.  Thus the construction of masculinity is, primarily, a collective enterprise, and it \nis the peer group, rather than individual boys, which are the main bearers of gender \ndefinitions (Connell 2000, Lesko, 2000).\nFor many pupils, the safest position to aim for in the formal school culture [2] is to be \n‘average’, while in the informal pupil culture it is to be the ‘same as the others’ for this \nprovides a certain protection from teasing and perhaps even subordination (Gordon et al. \n2000).  In fact, it is a paradox that while pupils attempt to construct their own ‘individual’ \nidentity, no-one aspires to be, or can afford to be, too different, and they are conscious \nthat they need to be ‘normal’ and ‘ordinary’ within the codes set by their own peer group.\nOne of the most urgent dimensions of school life for boys is the need to gain popularity \nand, in particular, status (see, Weber 1971, Corsaro 1979, Adler and Adler 1998): indeed, \nthe search to achieve status is also the search to achieve an acceptable form of \nmasculinity.  The boys’ notion of status comes from having a certain position within the \npeer group hierarchy which becomes relevant when it is seen in relation to others.  It is \nnot something that is given, but is often the outcome of intricate and intense \nmanoeuvring, and has to be earned through negotiation and sustained through \nperformance, sometimes on an almost daily basis.  Ultimately, the boys’ position in the \npeer group is determined by the array of social, cultural, physical, intellectual and \n4\neconomic resources that each boy is able to draw on and accumulate.  Although some of \nthe most esteemed resources will generally be an embodied form of physicality (sporty, \ntough etc), others may also be intellectual (general academic capability and \nachievement); economic (money); social and linguistic (interpersonal); or cultural (in \ntouch with the latest fashions, music, TV programmes, computer expertise etc).  Of \ncourse, ultimately, these resources are all symbolic in that their power and influence \nderives from their effect, and from what they are perceived to mean and stand for.  These \nresources will also always exist within determinate historical and spatial conditions. \nMoreover, the resources that are available will vary within different settings, and some \nmay be easier to draw on than others at particular times and in particular places.  This \nmeans that the boys who use a set of resources and interactional skills to establish high \nstatus in the dominant pupil hierarchy in one school will not necessarily be able to sustain \nthis position in another.\nBackground and methodology \nThe findings in this paper are based on data gathered in a year long empirical study \nbetween September 1998 and July 1999 set in three co-educational junior schools [3] in \nor around Greater London, UK.  The schools were selected through personal contacts and \nwith the help of Local Education Authority (LEA) inspectorate, and were differentiated \non the basis of the social characteristics of their intake (see Table 1).\nTABLE I GOES ABOUT HERE\nThe ethos, or atmosphere, of each school was very different.  Highwoods marketed itself \non the twin pillars of academic achievement and excellent sporting facilities; there was a \nhighly competitive atmosphere and the pupils were tightly regulated and controlled. \n5\nPetersfield also promoted high academic achievement (as measured by the SAT results) \nand also had firm control and regulation, although there was a deliberate policy of non-\ncompetitiveness.  Westmoor Abbey was very different: although all schools would like to \nbe able to state that their primary objective is the promotion of academic excellence, \nWestmoor Abbey’s main concern seemed to consist of being able to cope with, and \ncontain, pupil (mis)behaviour as best they could.  This was more of a survivalist school \n(Hargreaves 1995) where the ethos was more insecure, and social relations were \ngenerally poorer. \nDuring my fieldwork I followed a rolling programme spending about a month each term \nin each school.  In the two LEA (state) schools I concentrated on one Year 6 class (10-11 \nyear olds), although at Highwoods I spent time with two classes as the pupils were \norganised by academic attainment and I wanted to investigate the widest possible range \nof masculinities.  Highwoods also differed from the other two schools in that pupils were \ntaught by individual subject teachers.  My descriptions and interpretations below are \nbased on two major sources of data: firstly, my semi-participant observations of the boys \nand girls during lessons, and around the school site such as in the assembly hall, dining \nroom, playground environs etc; and secondly, on a series of 104 loosely-structured \ninterviews (62 involving only boys; 39 involving only girls; and 3 mixed) based on \nnominated friendship groups of between 2-3 pupils.  Many pupils were interviewed more \nthan once, and class teachers and head teachers were also interviewed.  During the \ninterviews my role was chiefly one of facilitator, with the pupils being encouraged to \nexpress their views freely, and share their experiences, on a wide range of topics. \nHowever, I also used direct questioning to test out emerging theories, clarify issues, and \nas a means to cross-check data from other interviewees. \nEthics\nDuring my fieldwork I had to make a number of decisions over whether or not I should \nintervene in a variety of situations.  Although I tried to take a non-interventionist and \n6\nnon-judgemental position my ethical position as a responsible researcher meant that some \ninterventions were unavoidable.  For example, I had one firm rule that I would always \nintervene if ever a child was in physical danger, and I would try and stop a serious fight if \nno other adults were around.  However, when I was in the playground and a child came \nup to tell me they were being bullied I would refer them to the teacher on duty.  Connolly \n(1996) notes that not intervening can reinforce and almost condone attitudes and \nbehaviours and yet, if I overheard examples of swearing, verbal bullying or homophobic \nabuse I would try and force myself to ‘turn a blind eye’. For example, here is an instance \nwhich I recorded in my field diary at Westmoor Abbey:\nFieldnotes (22.10.98). As we are leaving the classroom, I see Jack deliberately \nbarge into Jessie.  He knocks her over and she begins to cry.  Jack sees that I see it \nbut I don’t assume the teacher’s role and tell him off, or tell SM [Sandra Morris,  \nthe teacher].  Instead I ignore it –wonder if this is the right decision? \nThere are no easy answers here, and although I felt I might be betraying a trust by \n‘telling’ on them, perhaps the question to ask is whose trust, the perpetrator’s or the \nvictim’s?\nDuring some interviews it transpired that some boys were being bullied and made to feel \nvery unhappy.  Although I told them that I was unable to intervene directly, I always \nasked them if they wanted me to tell another adult in the school, such as their teacher or \nheadteacher, but this offer was not taken up.  Had I ever found out (and I did not) that any \nchild was in any immediate danger I would then have made every effort to persuade them \nto inform and seek help from an adult (see, for example, Alderson 1993, Morrow and \nRichards 1996, Hill 1997).  There is also an additional issue that I wish to mention \nconcerning the interviewer’s role during interview when he/she is attempting to elicit \ninformation about another person who is not present at the time.  For, although the \ninterviewer needs to show that he/she is actively involved, and part of the conversation \nwith the interviewees, I feel that it is important that he/she does not take sides against the \n7\nother person by egging interviewees on, and by openly agreeing with (and thus \ncondoning) views and stories which are potentially damaging and malicious.\nSubordinated groups and the ‘ideal’ boy at each school\nThe four classes that I studied were called 6J and 6B at Highwoods, 6H at Petersfield, \nand 6M at Westmoor Abbey.  As the period of research progressed, a number of patterns \nof masculinity began to emerge based around friendship groups which came from my \nown observations, and from the boys themselves during interview sessions.  Although \neach interview group had slightly different perceptions of how the boys’ friendship \ngroupings were constituted the names of the boys who were positioned at the bottom of \nthe peer group hierarchy were generally consistent.  Of course the boys’ classifications of \ntheir peers also revealed much about themselves, for as Bourdieu states, ‘nothing \nclassifies somebody more than the way he or she classifies’ (Bourdieu 1990:132).\nTABLE 2 GOES ABOUT HERE\nIn all three schools the idealised boy who exemplified the dominant/hegemonic form of \nmasculinity was connected with activity.  At Highwoods it was the sporty boy, probably \nthe captain of the football [5] A team which was the most prestigious sport amongst the \nboys.  At Petersfield, it was less clear but was still connected to physical/athletic ability \nwith the additional attribute of being a good cusser (a form of scathing wit).  At \nWestmoor Abbey, it was again the sporty boy, although in this school you also had to be \ntough, visibly contest teacher authority, be able to generate a laugh, and wear the right \nkinds of clothes/trainers.\n8\nSubordinated masculinities\nBeing different from the majority is often an unenviable position for boys (and girls) to \nbe in.  The powerful pressures to conformity that characterised the peer group cultures \nmeant that a boy had only to look, and be, slightly different from the norm to be accorded \ninferior status.  Under the rubric of ‘difference’, boys could be subordinated for \nassociating too closely with the formal school regime (such as by working too hard, being \ntoo compliant or over-polite); by speaking too formally/correctly or being ‘too posh’; by \nsinging in the choir; or by looking different.  Although I did not come across a single \nincident of any pupil being subordinated because of their ethnicity or race, aberrant \nphysical appearances and differences in body language were keenly scrutinised and \ncommented on.  As I have already written, boys had to work hard at learning the \nappropriate peer group norms, and to be included they had to be what Thornton (1997) \ncalls ‘in the know’: that is they needed to be able to talk about the right subjects, use the \nright speech (using the same style and vocabulary), wear the right clothes, play the right \nplayground games, as well as move (sit, walk, run, catch, throw, kick, hit etc) in the \n‘right’ way that being a boy demanded.  Although I did not come across any pupil being \nteased because they were wearing glasses, Simon was bullied at Westmoor Abbey \nbecause he was deemed to have a ‘funny shaped head’.  Pupils who had physical \n‘differences’ of the more unusual kind also did not always escape the more pernicious \ncomments.  For example, even though Peter (from the same class as Simon) suffered \nfrom alopecia, and was allowed to wear a base-ball cap in class to cover his baldness, he \nhad occasionally still been called names such as ‘cancer-head’ by a few boys, particularly \nfrom other classes.  However, the major material bodily difference came from the \nimpression of being overweight, and my data are littered with disparaging references \ndirected to boys and girls being ‘a big fat blob’, ‘fat-boy’, ‘too fat’, ‘so fat’, ‘really fat’ \nand so on.  It was a serious handicap to boys’ (or girls’) attempts to establish peer group \nstatus, and boys needed to use other strategies and resources in order to compensate for it. \nIn the extract below (which comes from Highwoods) I am trying to find out if a group of \nboys have any ideas why Rex (who is academically bright) misbehaves in certain classes. \nTravis’s theory is that Rex deliberately attempts to avert the masculine gaze:\n9\nTravis: Rex is too fat and he wants to [inaudible; much laughter]\nJS: ‘Cos of his weight? You mean ‘cos he’s fat? Why does that make \nhim not work hard?\nTravis: If he doesn’t make people think he’s funny they might go on about \nhis weight\nJS: Oh I see, so if he doesn’t play the class clown people would tease \nhim?\nTravis: Yeah\nSubordination could also come through perceived exhibitions of immature and babyish \nbehaviour (doing ‘silly’ things, playing infantile games, or associating too closely with \nyounger children); displaying a lack of toughness (such as crying, showing fear, not \nsticking up for yourself, and/or acting ‘soft’); being too passive and generally not active \nenough during both school sports and informal playground games; and showing a \nshortage of effort which was usually connected to a sporting context.  Boys were also \nsubordinated for the perception that they were wanting in certain culturally acclaimed \ntraits, particularly connected with embodied forms of physicality/athleticism (such as \nskill, strength, fitness and speed etc), and in areas of locally-defined class norms of \nacademic achievement (which included pupils who were on the school’s register for \nSpecial Educational Needs (SEN)).  Subordination could also accrue from an ignorance \nof locally-celebrated knowledge.  This could be, for example, in the latest culturally-hot \ntopics such as a TV programme, in the technical language of football, or unfamiliarity \nwith the latest computer games (such as PlayStation), and this could render a boy silent \nand be used as a marker of difference.  For example, Sam at Westmoor Abbey was \nderogated because he did not understand the off-side rule in football, and neither he or his \nfriend Simon knew the names or descriptions of some of the main characters in the TV \nprogramme South Park.  It was also important for a boy to be able to show a commitment \nto their adolescent future by being ‘in the know’ regarding the meaning of certain swear \nwords and matters of sexuality, although this did not appear as a main theme in any of the \ninterviews I conducted. \n10\nRobert: Me and Luke, in Year 5, we used to ask Sam about bodily parts \nwhich were rude and that, and ask him if/\nRyan: We’d ask Sam now about body parts\nRobert: Yeah, and ask if he knows [much laughter, I can’t hear everything \nthat is being said]\nChris:  He used to say when your nose goes stiff\nRyan: Like we asked him things like that\nRobert: We asked Sam what something was, I can’t remember what it \nwas, and I think he said something like ‘your tongue’ or something\nThe forms of discrimination worked at both the interpersonal and the group level.  The \nusual defamatory aspersions included ‘goody-goody’ (Highwoods), ‘teacher’s pet’ \n(Highwoods and Petersfield) and ‘boff’ (Westmoor Abbey) which were used to equate \nwith too-close a conformity with the formal school regime; while ‘wimp’, ‘sissy’, and \nparticularly ‘girl’ and ‘gay’ were used across all three schools as the main terms of abuse \nto confirm masculinity as heterosexual, and, to position boys as different and attack their \nidentity.  Much of these insults were insidious and occurred out of teachers’ earshot: \nmoreover, telling a teacher inevitably exacerbated the situation, and boys would find \nthemselves subjected to further, and more intense, levels of abuse.  There is a fuller \ndiscussion of homophobia at the end of the paper.  This next section considers \nsubordinated forms of masculinity at each of the three schools in turn.\nHighwoods \nIt soon emerged that there were only two boys at Highwoods who were isolated from the \nrest of their peer milieu, and who were regularly subordinated in the sense that they were \nactively, and almost continually, derogated and pursued: Timothy from 6J and Daniel \nfrom 6B.  Although they did not comply in their subordination, they found it too \npowerful to effectively resist.  What made the hegemonic agenda of competitive \nsport/games so powerful at this school was the fact that it was backed and, indeed \n11\ncreated, by the official school regime, and so the boys were able to use storylines that \nwere already there.  The following quotation, which was used about Timothy, could \napply equally to either boy:\nRex: He can’t play football, he can’t run, he can’t play rugby, he can’t play \ncricket and...he can’t play anything\nAs Highwoods operated a policy of selection, subordination by low academic attainment \nwas not such a prominent feature within the peer-group culture as in the other two \nschools.  Although it would be easy to assume that any boy who was unable to compete \nwith the cultural hegemony of the sporty boy would be subordinated this was not \nnecessarily always the case.  Other Year 6 boys who were in the school C teams (and \nwho were therefore both perceived and formally positioned as being less-\ntalented/proficient) told me that they experienced little or no abuse, and further \ninvestigation revealed that their poor sporting abilities was only one of a number of \nreasons for Timothy’s and Daniel’s exclusion.  The fundamental reason was that they \nwere different from the norm and were lacking certain culturally valued qualities.  Not \nonly were both boys no good at sport (and so had a shortage of sporting prowess), they \ndid not enjoy rough games (and so had a deficit of courage and toughness), and \nimportantly, gave the impression of putting in little effort.  Daniel was also accused of \npreferring to play with younger aged boys (presumably because he did not have any \nfriends in Year 6), and he supposedly had an obsession with sticks and was referred to by \nsome of the boys as ‘The Woodsman’. \nIn this long extract below we are talking about why three boys thought Timothy spent so \nmuch of his time on his own.  I have included such a long extract in its entirety as it \nprovides an unedited, contextualised, example of the kind of conversations I had with the \nboys.  There are lots of interruptions as the boys almost fall over each other in their \nenthusiasm to position Timothy as a kind of ‘unmasculinised other’ at the bottom of the \nhierarchy. \n12\nDerek: Well he’s like, he acts sometimes like/\nCalvin: A girl/\nDerek: A girl/\nSinclair: He doesn’t like sport, he doesn’t like computer games/\nCalvin: He does like computer/\nDerek: No, he plays all the crap ones, he plays all the crap ones/\nSinclair:  There’s this helicopter game/\nDerek:  No, there’s this 2-D helicopter game, you have to shoot these \nthings/\nSinclair: And he sort of, like, works on how to use the computer and not just \nall games on the computer and doing other stuff/\nCalvin: This is his idea of breaktime: practise his music notes, either the \ncomputer room, or practising his instrument, he’s like/\nDerek: He doesn’t enjoy it either\nCalvin: He doesn’t enjoy life, it’s like he doesn’t want to enjoy life, ‘cos he \ndoesn’t mix with other people, he doesn’t try to get friends [ ... ], \nhe doesn’t try to at all\nDerek: He just gives up/\nCalvin: He just gives up ...and he’s like, he even admits/\nSinclair: He doesn’t like football, he doesn’t like any sports apart from golf/\nCalvin: He’s different from everyone else\nJS: Yeah, but/\nDerek: He’s just one person/\nCalvin: And he likes to be by himself very often\nJS: What do you mean, he’s like a girl\nSinclair: Well/\nCalvin: Well he does everything/\nDerek: Well he doesn’t really act like a boy/\nCalvin: He’s very prudish/\nJS: Let’s hear from Sinclair\nSinclair: He’s always sort of like...when you call him a girl he’s just/ \n13\nCalvin: Yeah/\nDerek: He agrees\nJS: Does he get called a girl?\nSinclair: Yeah, he doesn’t sort of go, ‘Oh I’m not a girl,’ he just goes, ‘Ok’\nCalvin: Yeah, and sometimes he admits he’s a girl\nJS: Does he?\nDerek: Yeah, and we.../\nSinclair: Well I think he’s just sort of like joking actually/\nDerek: Yeah probably...he was born in the [inaudible]\nCalvin: And he’s very prudish and/\nJS: What do you mean, prudish?\nCalvin: When he’s at swimming, he always goes in the corner, he doesn’t \nlike to be with anyone\nDerek: He’s quite scared of stuff as well, like scared of the ball in rugby/\nSinclair: Yeah I remember in football, there were two people running for the \nball and Timmy sort of like backed away \nDerek: And when the ball is coming at him [in rugby] he just drops it and/\nSinclair: Yeah he can’t kick it you know [ .. ], it was painful to watch \nyesterday\nCalvin: He’s like a boy yeah, he’s like.../\nSinclair: He’s a boy but he, like, wants to be a girl\nCalvin: Well he doesn’t want to be, I think like, he backs away from \neverything, and he’s like...if someone has a go at us...if someone \npushes us we’ll push them back, this is a simple way of saying it: if \nsomeone pushes us, we’ll push them back\nJS: You stick up for yourselves/\nCalvin: Yeah. Timmy, if someone pushed him, he goes and tells the \nteacher or/\nDerek: He gets scared/\nCalvin: He gets scared\nDerek: He cries a bit I think/\n14\nJS: I’ve noticed that he’s very polite as well, does that/\nDerek:  He’s too polite, it’s like the formal thing we did in English/ [in that  \nmorning’s English lesson]\nJS: He speaks in quite a formal register\nDerek And we’re informal\nSinclair: He can’t sort of say, ‘Shut up,’ to someone \nDerek: And he doesn’t say any swear words or anything\nCalvin: We don’t use swear words/\nSinclair: Well not in school\nCalvin: No, we don’t say them ever [laughter from Derek]\nJS: So he always speaks in the same way, whereas you’d speak to your \nmates totally differently\nDerek: Yeah, and he doesn’t have different interests, he doesn’t really like \nSouth Park does he? [turning to the other two boys]\nCalvin: He doesn’t like anything we like/\nSinclair: He doesn’t like anything violent or rude\nAnd so, again, all the reasons given above can be categorised under difference.  Indeed, \nat one point, Calvin actually says: ‘He’s different from everyone else’.  Although the \nreasons include his poor sporting ability (he does not like games, he is no good at games, \nhe is frightened of getting hurt in games), there are also a number of other factors which \nhave caused Timothy’s exclusion.  He uses the computer in a different way, he does not \nenjoy life, he lacks perseverance and gives up too easily, he’s prudish when getting \nchanged, he does not stand up or himself, he cries in front of his peers (the antithesis of \nmanliness), he is too polite, he does not swear, he speaks in rather an affected, posh \nregister, he does not like the same cultural interests such as watching the TV programme \nSouth Park and so is unable to share in common topics of conversation.  Time and time \nagain in the interviews, the boys would refer to Timothy’s ‘posh accent’.  Although, \nnearly all of the boys at Highwoods were very well spoken, they felt that Timothy’s voice \nwas rather unnatural and affected, and this set him apart from themselves.  Although \nsome may argue that this may have been a class reaction, I would maintain that it is used \n15\nas another factor which helped to construct him as ‘other’.  One of the main tactics the \nboys use is by feminising Timothy and they use the word ‘girl’ six times during the \ntranscript.  In other words, they are saying that he, and the femininity associated with \nhim, is diametrically opposed to them: he (and it) are defined by what they are not. \nEpstein (1998b:103) writes that, ‘the worst thing a boy can be called is a “girl”, even \nworse than being called “gay boy”, “poof” or “sissy” ’, but although this was confirmed \nby a few boys at each school, the majority told me that it was actually swear words or (at \nPetersfield) a really bad cuss concerning their mother that really upset them.\nPetersfield\nRather unusually, and unlike in the classes at my other two schools, there were only two \nfriendship groups of boys in class 6H (see, for example, Pollard 1985, Thorne 1993, \nAdler and Adler 1998, Connolly 1998, Renold 1999).  Out of the 18 boys, there was one \nlarge, dominant group of 13 boys, and 5 others who were victimised and subordinated. \nThe dominant group at Petersfield also categorised and defined the other smaller group of \nboys by their ‘differences’.  They were regarded, and pathologised, as non modern and \ndeficient in knowledge of up-to-date things (such as TV, computer programs, football \nnews and results etc); as lacking in ‘coolness’ by not wearing the latest fashions and \ntrends; as not being sufficiently loyal to friends by not sticking up for their mates; and \nscant in athleticism or sportyness.  They were also perceived to be wanting in a certain \nYear 6 sophistication by being more immature and ‘babyish’, and their counter school \nbehaviour was deemed to be ‘naughty’ and ‘silly’.\nJS: What marks out this group from the other group of boys?\nRichard: They do silly things/\nMatthew: Yeah\nJS: Silly things, such as?\nRichard: Going to the toilet with some wet tissues and throwing \nthem at the ceiling...erm/\n16\nMatthew: Going in the infants playground/\nRichard: Yeah, they go into the infants, hide behind the trees, and \nthen they run and bang on the windows in the infants\nJS: […] So they do silly things, what else?\nRobin: They play silly games...like, they chase the girls all the way \naround/\nRichard: And kiss them\nMatthew: Yeah\nJS: But you say, you chase the girls as well?\nRichard: Yeah, but we don’t try and get them, we just try and beat \nup each other, so if, like, Candy gets some of us, she \npunches us and that\nJS: Right, so it’s a different form of game with the girls\nRichard/Matthew: Yeah\nAlthough there was more resistance to the hegemonic agenda than at Highwoods (and at \nWestmoor Abbey) the subordinated type of masculinity found itself swamped by the \nsheer numbers of boys embracing the dominant form.  The differences were also \nrecognised by the girls who also categorised the boys into two main groups.  They saw \none (group) as ‘trendy’ and ‘new’ in terms of clothing/appearance, linguistic locutions, \nand socio-cultural knowledge, and therefore, the ‘popular’ ones; while the other (group) \nwas the opposite of this and, hence, ‘sad’ and ‘annoying’.  The popular group had a \ncertain style which was seen as a symbolic expression of masculinity, ‘a collective \nevocation of an attitude embodied in their movements and appearance’ (Radley 1995:9).\nJulia: They’re the more popular ones...like everyone wants to hang \naround with that group\nFiona: And, I’m not meaning to be rude, but they’re a bit sad\nJS: Right, OK...so sad in what way?\nJulia:  Er, they go around annoying the girls\nFiona: They spread rumours, and try and break the girls up\n17\nJulia: […] It’s just that they’re more...trendy\nJS: Modern, trendy? Trendy in what way then?\nJulia: Like, they wear the clothes, they talk like how everyone talks and \neverything like that\nFiona: And ‘cos Richard and CT are really, like, hip and cool, like \neveryone goes with them and everything/\nJS: Right, in what way are they hip and cool?\nJulia: All the new PlayStation games...the new computers, things like \nthat\nJS: So they’re up with the latest kind of trends?\nJulia: Yeah\nThe point is not so much whether these things were actually all true but that they were \nthought to be true, for their power and influence derived from their effect, and from what \nthey were perceived to mean and stand for.  The fact that, for instance, Gavin and Andre \nwore a popular make of trainers was not even noticed by some of the boys in the \ninterviews.  When Denis deliberately broke a toilet window it was regarded as being \n‘naughty’, and rather wild whereas, I have the suspicion, that if one of the leading boys in \nthe class had done such a thing they would have been thought of, by some of the others at \nleast, as being a hero of counter school resistance. \nWestmoor Abbey\nThe subordinated boys at Westmoor Abbey experienced far greater levels of abuse than \nat the other two schools.  Levels of verbal and physical bullying were high and \nhomophobia was prevalent throughout the peer group culture.  There was virtually no \nresistance to the hegemonic pattern, (at least in class 6M) and all the boys practised a \ntype of the dominant masculinity but to a greater or lesser degree.  There were only three \nboys in class 6M who experienced ongoing subordination and Emlyn only joined the \nclass in March.  Emlyn found it difficult to form friendships and was widely disparaged. \n18\nAgain, the main strategies used came under the rubric of difference.  Of course Emlyn \nwas immediately different because he had come from another school, but he was nearly \neverything the dominant form of masculinity was not.  He worked hard, was a high \nacademic achiever (he actually got three Level 5s in his SATs [6]) and was thought of as \na ‘know-all’; he was polite and did not call out in class; he spoke with a middle class \naccent which the boys (and girls) castigated as ‘posh’; he wore school uniform; he did not \nact tough and did not stick up for himself; and, he was overweight and rather \nunaccomplished at games and sport (particularly in terms of speed, skill, coordination, \nand levels of fitness).  In the conversation below I am asking how Emlyn is getting on in \nthe weekly football games where I had heard that he was playing in goal.  Notice the \nderogatory comments about his the way he moves (like a goalkeeper in a computer \ngame), his level of fitness, and about his weight which was deemed to cause an absence \nof bodily control:\nChris: He’s like this right: do you know, like, on computer games when \nyou boot the ball, yeah, he [the goalkeeper] catches it and then he \nfalls on the floor, Emlyn pretends he’s done a wicked dive but he’s \nso fat, so the ball’s, like, past him into the back of the net, then he \ndives.\nRobert: Or if the ball’s just in front of him and it’s stopped/\nChris: He sweats well bad ‘cos like he’s here, Eric’s there, the ball’s there \nand he’s running and he’s sweating\nThe other two boys who were regularly bullied and subordinated were Simon and Sam\nwho were not close friends, but often came together by default because they were \nostracised from the other friendship groups.  In the next extract I am asking three boys \nabout people who are bullied, trying to uncover some of the reasons why they get picked \non:\nChris: Some people, including me, bully Simon and Georgia, ‘cos we say \n‘Egghead’ and ‘Spam’ and things\n19\nJS: Why is Simon picked on?\nChris:  I dunno, it’s just that he’s got a funny head and people say/\nRobert: And he’s got a funny voice…and he’s sort like really soft inside \nand so he’s easy to, like/\nChris: Pick on\nRyan: He’s a bit behind\nThe physical features again play a part but it is also because Simon is ‘soft inside’ and \ntherefore the antithesis of what a boy at Westmoor Abbey needed to be like.  Both Simon \nand Sam (and Georgia, mentioned above) were also on the school’s Special Needs \nRegister and received extra help with their work from a Teacher’s Assistant [7]. \nHowever, the main reason that Simon and Sam were subordinated was that they did not \npossess any other resources to compensate and construct their masculine identities in \nother ways.\nJS: Why aren’t they that popular then?\nTom: Because, like, they don’t do anything, they’re not good at football, \nthey’re not good at running, they’re not fast\nEric: You’ve got to be good at something to be popular\nTom:  They ain’t no good at drawing\nJS: OK, so there’s nothing that they’re really good at?\nTom:  No.\nHomophobia\nAlthough homophobia was most prevalent and persistent at Westmoor Abbey, \nhomophobic abuse was also an enduring constituent of the peer group culture at each \nschool.  In fact, the word ‘gay’ was probably the most common word of abuse found \nacross all three schools and was used to describe anything from being not very good to \nabsolute rubbish.  At Westmoor Abbey, I found that a boy could even have ‘gay’ trainers \n20\nif they were perceived to be a not very good make.  Many researchers (see, for example, \nConnell 1990, Epstein 1996, Johnson 1996, Mason 1996, Epstein and Johnson 1998, \nGilbert and Gilbert 1998) argue that dominant masculinity sees homosexuality as a threat \nand so attempts to distance itself by vilifying and oppressing it through homophobia.  By \ndoing so, the boys are making the point that their own sexualities are entirely ‘straight’ \nand ‘unfeminine’ in every way, and ‘in a doubly defining moment the homophobic \nperformance consolidate[s] the heterosexual masculinity of Self and the homosexual \nfemininity of Other’ (Kehily and Nayak 1997: 82).  Hence it can also be argued that by \nsubordinating alternative masculinities/sexualities, these performances also, by default, \nsubordinate femininities which, therefore, include all girls.  Some boys told me that they \nonly called other boys names like ‘gay’ or ‘queer’ for a joke or a laugh, and that it was \nnot meant to be ‘nasty’ or ‘harmful’.  However, as Gilbert and Gilbert (1998) point out, \nthese names are more than a personal insult as the victims are implicated in wider \ndiscourses of public condemnation, and so endure the abuse from an entire community. \nAt the very least homophobia should be regarded as a form of bullying, while other \nwriters (see, for example, Epstein 1996, Salisbury and Jackson1996, Skelton 2001) argue \nthat it should be regarded as a form of sexual harassment.\nIn many ways, homophobia is another aspect of masculine performance (Nayak and \nKehily 1996).  Epstein (1996) maintains that homophobia also plays a fundamental role \nin regulating and constructing heterosexual masculinities in schools: masculinity and \nheterosexuality are entwined and thus to be a ‘real’ boy (or girl) is to be heterosexual. \nParker (1996) asserts that these homophobic insults should be conceptualised in terms of \ngender as opposed to sexuality, and that they therefore imply being ‘non-masculine’ and \n‘effeminate’ rather than homosexual.  However, the essential point is that homophobia is \nused to police and control the general behaviour of boys and their sexuality, and is used \nas a strategy to position boys at the bottom of the masculine hierarchy.\nSometimes, boys appeared to notice the seeming incongruity of calling a boy ‘gay’ and’ a \ngirl’ (almost) at the same time.  As Timothy (from Highwoods) said: ‘My mum just tells \nme things to say to them, like, erm, well, ‘cos they also call me gay and I say, ‘Well at \n21\nleast I like being a girl because I can’t be gay.’  However, of course, both these terms \nwere actually used to mean ‘other’.  Epstein (1997:109) found that homophobia was used \ntowards boys as a means of implying their similarity to girls, and that the terms ‘gay’ and \n‘sissy’ were often used interchangeably.  Boys certainly risked derogation if they \nassociated too closely with girls, and from an early age they have to work hard to prove \nthat they have the right masculine credentials as heterosexual boys.  In one of the \ninterviews Fred, at Petersfield, told me of a conversation he had had with Jinesh (one of \nthe class leaders) which had arisen after some of the boys had been calling him ‘Barbie’ \n(after Barbie doll).  This had happened because he was perceived to be fraternising too \nclosely with the girls and the following quotation shows Jinesh clearly defining the \nnormative boundaries. \nFred:  I mean, [I said to him], ‘It’s nice to be popular with girls, like with the   \n boys’, and he [Jinesh] went, ‘No it isn’t, I like to play with the boys, and \n if you’re a boy you’re like a sissy if you play with the girls’\nIn some ways this may seem an apparent contradiction in that when people are popular \nwith the opposite sex it is usually taken as an expression of, and confirmation of, their \nheterosexuality.  As Josh (from Highwoods) told me, ‘the people who hang around the \ngirls and talk to the girls cannot be called gay’, and this could cause confusion when boys \nwere collectively constructing others as gay.  In the passage below I am talking with three \nother boys at Highwoods about Travis who has been referred to by some boys as being \ngay.\nJosh: Oh yes, he’s gay, totally gay\nPaddy: He took down his trousers and showed his bot at the window\nAdam:  He kissed Jenny, didn’t he?\nJS: But if can kiss Jenny, how can he be gay?\nAdam: I think he did\nJosh: He didn’t, he didn’t [getting excited]\nJS: I mean that just seems/\n22\nJosh: It’s weird because, I don’t know, I don’t know whether he’s gay or \nnot\nJS: All right\nJosh: He acted gay but he’s always hangs around with the girls\nJS: What do you mean, ‘he acts gay’, how do you act gay?\nJosh: I don’t know\nPaddy: Like he goes up to the boys and he starts saying to them, ‘Er-er-er-\ner-er-er-er.’\nIt  is  interesting to  see  the  backtracking and negotiations  going on in  the peer  group \ndynamics as they try and work out the contradictions of showing your bottom at the \nwindow when changing for games and kissing a girl, and in the end Paddy is reduced to \njustifying the assertion of Travis’s gayness by the fact that Travis makes a series of funny \nnoises.\nConclusions\nThis paper has concentrated on subordinated groups of boys in three schools and has \nproposed that the strategies of subordination used by the dominant boys can be \nsummarised under the generic heading of ‘difference’.  Many of these were linked to the \nbody (particularly in embodied forms of physicality/athleticism) which was the primary \nresource used to establish peer group status, and those boys who either would not, or \ncould not, use this resource were generally positioned at the bottom of the pupil \nhierarchy.  We can see that these boys endured a considerable amount of suffering, and \ntheir lives at school were often both an undesirable and unhappy experience.  Clearly, this \nsituation is not limited to these schools, or to the UK.  A greater awareness and \nunderstanding of some of the motivations behind the methods of subordination employed \nwill give inclusive educators a better chance of formulating programs to counter some of \nthe worst excesses of dominant masculinity.  The paper has argued that the peer group \n23\nhas a fundamental influence on the formation of their masculine identities, and that there \nis a powerful, almost overwhelming, need to play safe and conform to the group norms. \nAlthough difference from girls is a central component in the construction of masculinity, \nthe boys in the three schools generally tended to categorise girls as different rather than \noppositional, and the most common reaction and relationship was one of detachment and \ndisinterest.  Some writers such as Jordan (1995:69-86) and Renold (1999) claim that it \nbecomes even more important for subordinated boys to define themselves against the \nfemale, and that when they are threatened, and feel more insecure, they are more likely to \nengage in anti-feminine behaviour than boys who exhibit other masculine forms. \nHowever this was not confirmed amongst the subordinated boys in this study.  From my \nobservations and interviews (including those with the girls), I was unaware of any boy in \nthis category of masculinity traducing the girls; if anything, they tended to keep away \nfrom them as they were still keen to mark out their own spaces and define their identities \nas different from femininity.\nThe final section discussed the pervasive use of homophobia and I concluded that, \nalthough masculinity defines itself as exclusively heterosexual, and homophobic abuse is \nused as a means of normalising a boy’s masculine identity, it is also employed as another \nway of  positioning boys at the bottom of the peer group hierarchy as ‘non-masculine’ \nand/or ‘effeminate’ and can therefore be conceptualised in terms of gender as well as sex.\n* Approximately 7600 words\nKey to Transcripts\n/ Indicates the moment when an interruption in speech begins;\n... a natural pause in the conversation;\n[italic text] descriptive text to provide background information;\n24\n[ ... ] extracts edited out of the transcript.\nNotes\n[1] The majority of the research comes from Australia and the UK.  For example, in the \nsecondary school sector there is research from Willis (1977), Corrigan (1979), Heward \n(1988), Walker (1988), Connell (1989, 1996), Mac an Ghaill (1994), Nayak and Kehily \n(1996), Parker (1996), Kehily and Nayak (1997), Redman and Mac an Ghaill (1997), \nFitzclarence and Hickey (1998), Martino(1999), Gordan et al. (2000), Light and Kirk \n(2000), and, in the primary sector, there are studies from Thorne (1993), Jordan (1995), \nSkelton (1996, 1997, 2000), Warren (1997), Adler and Adler (1998), Connolly (1998), \nBenjamin (1998), Epstein (1998a), Francis (1998), Gilbert and Gilbert (1998), Renold \n(1999, 2000, 2001), Lesko (2000) and Swain (2000, 2002a, 2002b).\n[2] During my field work I differentiated between the formal and the informal cultures of \nthe school.  The formal school culture is laid out in documents of the school and state, \nand includes the teaching and learning, the pedagogy, the disciplinary apparatus, and the \npolicy/organisational and administrative structures (Gordon et al. 2000).  The informal \nschool culture is not intended to be in binary opposition, for it is different from, rather \nthan a reaction to, and is in a continual negotiation with, the formal school culture: it \nincludes not only the relations and interactions between the pupils, but also the informal \nrelations between pupils and teachers outside of the instructional relationship.\n[3] To protect anonymity, all names of places and people have been changed.\n[4] In order to disguise the school’s identity the number of pupils on roll have been \nrounded up or down to the nearest 25\n[5] Throughout the paper, ‘football’ refers to the game of ‘association football’ or \n‘soccer’.\n25\n[6] SATs are Standard Assessment Tasks (Tests) which pupils take at the ages of 7, 11, \nand 14 in English, Mathematics and Science\n[7] Teachers’ assistants or ‘Support Teachers’ were used at both LEA schools to support \npupils with their class work and spent time in the classroom on most days.\nReferences\nAdler, A. and Adler, P.

This paper explores strategies used by school boys aged 10-11 to \nsubordinate and position boys at the bottom of the pupil hierarchy.  The findings are \nbased on data gathered from a year long empirical study (between 1998 and 1999) set in \nthree UK junior schools which were differentiated by the social characteristics of their \nintake.  The research emphasises the role of the body in the construction of masculinity. \nThe hegemonic, or most idealised, form of masculinity at each school was constructed \naround activity and, in particular, various forms of embodied physicality/athleticism \n(exemplified through skill, strength, fitness and speed), and boys who did not wish to, or \nwho were unable to, use these resources generally found themselves marginalised and/or \nsubordinated.  Many of the subordinated forms were symbolically assimilated to \nfemininity, and the paper proposes that the main strategies of subordination can be \nsummarised under the generic heading of ‘difference’.  The final section discusses the \npervasive use of homophobia, and concludes that it should be conceptualised in terms of \ngender as well as sex.\n36\nBiographical details \nJon Swain is an ethnographic researcher with interests in masculinities and school \nprocesses.  He has spent the majority of his working life as a primary school teacher in \nthe UK, and is currently working as a research officer at King’s College, University of \nLondon.\nAddress for correspondence:\n4 Valley Court\nCavendish Avenue\nWoodford Green\nEssex IG8 9DB\ne-mail: <jms123@jms123.freeserve.co.uk>\ntelephone number: 020 8505 5867\n37\n",

    "abstract": "It is important for educators to understand the tactics used in subordination between young people if they are going to take effective measures to counter them in their pedagogical practice. This paper explores strategies used by school boys aged 10-11 to subordinate and position boys at the bottom of the pupil hierarchy. The findings are based on data gathered from a year long empirical study (between 1998 and 1999) set in three UK junior schools which were differentiated by the social characteristics of their intake. The research emphasises the role of the body in the construction of masculinity. The hegemonic, or most idealised, form of masculinity at each school was constructed around activity and, in particular, various forms of embodied physicality/athleticism (exemplified through skill, strength, fitness and speed), and boys who did not wish to, or who were unable to, use these resources generally found themselves marginalised and/or subordinated. Many of the subordinated forms were symbolically assimilated to femininity, and the paper proposes that the main strategies of subordination can be summarised under the generic heading of ‘difference’. The final section discusses the pervasive use of homophobia, and concludes that it should be conceptualised in terms of gender as well as sex",
