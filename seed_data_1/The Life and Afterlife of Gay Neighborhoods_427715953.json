This important work summarizes years of sustained research abouthow LGBTQ+ people inhabit and interact with urban space, forming gay neighbor-hoods (or “gayborhoods”) that have been a hallmark in recent decades of gay urbanlife. In the recent past, before gay neighborhoods such as we conceive of them today,gay bars provided one venue for LGBTQ+ people to visit and learn about them-selves. These bars were often located in isolated and dangerous locations and wereoften raided by police. However, greater physical safety made it easier for largernumbers of LGBTQ+ individuals to begin to form communities. In Montréal, forexample, this happened in the early 1980s. The gay village in Montréal had changeda great deal over the years, and throughout my own research, I interviewed manyLGBTQ+ people who helped me to better understand their contributions to creatingsafe community spaces—fledgling gay neighborhoods—based on the various visionsof what they wanted. Their energy was contagious. When these early pioneers andbusiness owners had a creative idea, they went for it. It was a cast of differentcharacters doing different things and their efforts built the neighborhoods we knowtoday.In assembling this impressive volume, the editors have brought together a collec-tion of leading scholars who document for future generations the evolution of gayneighborhoods and especially their maturation that brings us to the present-daysituation of depopulation and “de-gaying” in gayborhoods. The chapters containedherein examine the evolution, history, and importance of gay neighborhoods andhow they have changed over time and persevered against adversity for the LGBTQ+community. With its comprehensive treatment of LGBTQ+ culture as reflected inurban placemaking, this critical work will undoubtedly become a key resource inLGBTQ+ studies, provide a comprehensive resource for students and scholars acrossthe academic landscape from architecture to sociology and from anthropology tourban planning. The editors are to be commended for including research from adiverse group of scholars representing various academic disciplines and focusingthe chapters on the importance of gayborhoods not only to LGBTQ+ people, but tosociety more broadly.viiviii ForewordThis book introduces a broad cross-section of perspectives that successive gener-ations of LGBTQ+ individuals share about gay life—and especially about gaybor-hoods. Sometimes there is harmony in these viewpoints between generationalcohorts, and sometimes there is discord. But interactions with other groups canenlarge our worldview and lead to more inclusive outcomes. I have witnessed thisthroughout my career as an administrator in higher education and a professor ofsociology and anthropology.From my own window I can see the gay village in Montréal. Rainbow flags areproudly displayed and vibrant colored decorations hang above the street, created byan artist that joked the various colors show the “eighteen shades of gay,” representingthe many differences united under the LGBTQ+ moniker. The gay neighborhood inMontréal remains thriving and vital. It too has changed over the years to becomemore inclusive but still serves as a magnet for LGBTQ+ people of all ages and playsan important role for the dominant group in the broader city.As we navigate through the tumultuous year 2020—through the COVID-19pandemic, racial and social unrest in North America and other countries, and theeternal struggle for greater equity and equality—we are reminded that the uniquemanifestations of the struggle for human and civil rights are evident in places likegay neighborhoods. We are reminded of the critical, cultural, and historic impor-tance of gayborhoods as the engines of societal momentum. Like the adaptation ofgay neighborhoods in the 1980s and 1990s to battle the HIV/AIDS pandemic, gayneighborhoods, though at a point of plateau, still serve a vital purpose in our cities oftoday and tomorrow. The fact that LGBTQ+ people have been systematically deniedrights and are, at times statistically invisible—as demonstrated in several chapters inthis book—suggests that we are now at a plateau not only in the development of gayneighborhoods but also in the steady march toward LGBTQ+ rights and recognition.The change will continue to come to gay neighborhoods, some quicker than others,and the neighborhoods will evolve as the people that use them change and age andnew generations come of age.Over my lifetime, many changes have occurred in the manner by which LGBTQ+people are perceived, treated, and legally protected. In 1977, The Quebec charter ofhuman rights and freedoms made discrimination based on sexual orientation illegal.Montréal, my home, has become a very friendly place for LGBTQ+ people to live. Asthese rights have been secured in cities across the world, the preferences of LGBTQ+concerning where they live have reflected these changes, and so an in-depth studyof gayborhoods helps us reflect on the desire for gay men and lesbian women toself-segregate in certain urban districts and for other LGBTQ+ individuals to live inareas outside of gay neighborhoods. It also provides us an opportunity to reflect onForeword ixLGBTQ+ people in other areas of the world that do not share these freedoms. Wehave come so far, but in so many ways, we still have so far to go.September 2020 Donald W. HinrichsProfessor Emeritus of Sociology andAnthropologyGettysburg CollegeGettysburg, PA, USAMontréal, Quebec, CanadaPrefaceA book about gay neighborhoods? It is a question that we have heard many timesduring the past two years of assembling this book. Through traveling and workingin Asia, Western and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Australia, South America,Africa, as well the United States and Canada, our observations have piqued ourinterest in the state of gay neighborhoods and quality of life for LGBTQ+ people inall corners the world. Some gayborhoods appear vital and striving, some appear to bediminishing, some are notably different in character from years past, but all—more orless—seem to be existing, in North American and Western Europe, over a backdropof increasing civil rights and legal protections. The situation is not so positive inother parts of the world, however. In parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and theformer Soviet Republics, LGBTQ+ individuals continued to experience harassmentand persecution. Some gay neighborhoods in locationswhere homosexuality remainsillegal are probably yet to even emerge.We begin by humbly recognizing our position of privilege as gay, cis, whitemales.We are fortunate to have been awarded advanced degrees and have earned tenure atuniversities based on our research and scholarship. Our experience likely does notfully reflect the experience of other readers, but we acknowledge the responsibilitythat comes from living in a country where freedom of expression and our positionsas tenured university professors allow us the freedom to explore ideas and to speakpublicly about LGBTQ+ concerns. However, despite an overall increase in rights forLGBTQ+ people over the past seventy years, prejudice and discrimination persist.Even in societies that ensure some degree of legal protection to LGBTQ+ individuals,a systemic anti-gay sentiment prevails. Within our own institutions, support for thisvolume—often referred to as “that gay” project by our colleagues—was at best, luke-warm.At an early stage of the project, a senior university administrator—in ameetingof faculty and staff members—referred to one of the editors as “a soft boy.” Anothersenior administrator referred to the editor in a separate meeting as “emotional andsensitive.” This euphemistic sort of coded triggering—often used to describe gaymen by using terms associated with feminine qualities—implies “gayness” withoutresorting outright to a derogatory slur. However, some were not even this clever.Separately, the other editor encountered resistance when a senior academic admin-istrator characterized this book as “stupid, gay, faggot bullshit that no one has timexixii Prefaceto read” and encouraged abandoning the project because the book “wouldn’t be wellreceived on campus” due to its LGBTQ+ focus which “makes donors and alumniuncomfortable.” Challenges such as these make our gay studies scholarship difficultto promote on campus and tarnish the celebration of publishing this important work.Notably, the last of these commentswasmade by an administrator at aU.S. institutionin the Spring of 2020, only weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v.ClaytonCounty that “sex” is a protected class that includes the prohibition of discrim-ination on the basis of “sexual orientation,” thereby extending legal protection againstdiscriminatory—and only recently, illegal—comments such as these. These experi-ences listed above exemplify the disconnect between perceived legal protection andactual legal protection, demonstrating that while LGBTQ+ people have struggled toachieve equality, true equity for LGBTQ+ individuals remains in the distant future.But as we reflect on where we are now and from where we have come, we are fortu-nate to have been alive to see several landmark legal rulings and policy changes thatimproved the lives of LGBTQ+ people. Nonetheless, veiled discrimination againstLGBTQ+ individuals remains embedded even with legal protections in place, andthe fight for dignity has really only just begun.Discussions with our LGBTQ+ colleagues and contributing authors suggest thatcomments such as these are not unusual. One contributing author was told by a seniorcolleague that though the chapter could be included in this book that it would not“count” toward tenure or promotion due to its LGBTQ+ focus, which the adminis-trator had deemed “outside” a desired area of scholarly expertise. Unkind treatmentand comments such as these indicate to us that while the struggle for LGBTQ+ rightshas made some significant advances, that systematized discrimination, hostility, anddisregard for LGBTQ+ individuals to some degree endures even within more inclu-sive societies. This troubling persistence makes these advances tenuous, and we arereminded that true equality for LGBTQ+ remains elusive. Additionally, LGBTQ+colleagues in other regions of the world, including the Global South, still have muchlonger to go before they begin to approach the level or rights and recognition thatsome of us enjoy today.This unstable backdrop provides the context and fuels our scholarship in LGBTQ+studies and specifically our interest in the study of gay neighborhoods. We aretrained in design and architecture, civil engineering and urban planning, and Amer-ican studies. We love cities and we love understanding how people create homes,neighborhoods, and communities. We appreciate the fact that in our professionaland scholarly work, we are given opportunities to study cities and understand whatmakes them work, and sometimes we even contribute to shaping the future of cities.We are compelled to explore the idea of transformations in gay neighborhoods, andwe seek to understand and positively influence the future of LGBTQ+ urban spaces.Gay neighborhoods are the figurative cradle of the struggle for LGBTQ+ toler-ance, acceptance, freedom, equality, and pride. True, gayborhoods are fun places tovisit replete with vivacious bars, sassy LGBTQ-themed gift shops, exuberant cafésand restaurants, and salacious shops that peddle adult-themedmerchandise.However,gay neighborhoods also serve a deeper and less readily apparent purpose: they arethe cultural centers of LGBTQ+ life and often provide the formative physical spacePreface xiiifor organizing in the ongoing fight in support of equality, same-sexmarriage, alterna-tive lifestyles and amorous arrangements, sexual positivity, and personal expression.Some established gay neighborhoods are home to LGBTQ+museums, archives, andorganizations that support the preservation of various shades of LGBTQ+ cultureand history. This history is important for future generations and should not be lostto the dustbin of history because its value is not immediately apparent or becauseprejudice prevents proper funding or equitable access to support preservation efforts.As we visited gayborhoods during our travels, we noticed—during the last 20years—the closure of bookstores and gay-oriented businesses and less foot traffic atgay bars and restaurants. Residents and businesses owners struggled with escalatingrents and property values; they were victims of the gentrification they unintentionallyhelped, in the quest to build vital neighborhoods and to foster community for allLGBTQ+ people. There was a certain level of sanitization of city streets, whileat the same time there was increased tourism to ‘gay meccas’ from which Prideparades and carnivals emanate but that visitors frequent less. We noticed that non-LGBTQ+ people felt more comfortable visiting gayborhoods. Gay bars and gayrestaurants, once a no-go zone for mainstream straight patrons, now provided a hipand cool experience or colorful night out for those who do not identify as LGBTQ+,making once gay-exclusive neighborhoods markedly “less gay.” The undergrounddrag culture was no longer underground; drag became part of mainstream culture andwas featured on cable television, and now legions of straight fans are “spilling tea”and “throwing shade” as they sashay away from their television screens. This level ofawareness has provided a degree of celebrity for drag performers across mainstreamculture, helping to make LGBTQ+ culture more accessible, but perhaps diluting thequalities of LGBTQ+ culture that make gay neighborhoods typologically unique.Similarly, ‘gay-friendly’ spaces in gayborhoods became popular, bolsteringrevenues for gayborhood business owners, and perhaps producing truly inclusiveand diverse neighborhoods under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, but inviting the curious,voyeuristic, and sometimes judgmental eye of heteronormative society into gayspace. Inside homes and apartment buildings in gay neighborhoods, there was ashift in the demographics of the ‘gay family’, which now included children. Thisrequired a different set of amenities in neighborhoods, including child care, elemen-tary schools, playgrounds and play spaces, and family healthcare. This is a starkdifferent from gay neighborhoods of the 1970s, perceived mostly as playground forchildless adult gaymen. In response and in search of peace, gay friends have streamedfrom gay neighborhoods to mainstream neighborhoods, and by so doing, have madevarious once-heteronormative neighborhoods “more gay.”Our own scholarship and our worldview has been strongly affected by seminalworks in the field such as Steven Seidman’s (2004) Beyond the Closet, GeorgeChauncey’s Gay New York (2008), Amin Ghaziani’s There Goes the Gayborhood(2015), and Jeremiah Moss’ Vanishing New York (2017). Aside from these works,gay neighborhoods—and their evolution, trajectories, and future—are sparsely docu-mented in social sciences scholarship, even in research about gay and lesbian cultureand the LGBTQ+ experience. We thus felt that gay neighborhoods is a topic worthyof academic investigation and review. To augment our own research about LGBTQ+xiv Prefaceurban space, we invited many of the world’s leading experts to contribute their schol-arship. Every effort has been made to acknowledge copyright holders of images usedthroughout this book. We are happy to correct any oversights or acknowledgementsin future editions of this book.We also hope to acknowledge in this work the generational differences that mani-fest in gayborhoods and the diverse residents and visitors that inhabit LGBTQ+urbanspace. Younger generations of ‘out and proud’ LGBTQ+ individuals who have thefreedom and right to exercise and investigate, for example, fluid sexual orientationoften do not fully appreciate the civil rights that were both hard-fought and hard-won by generations of gay men and lesbians women only 20 or 30 years older. Thecommunity culture related to age in the LGBTQ+ community is noticeably morestratified. For example, old queers wanting to get together to play cards and drinkbeer perceive younger twinks to be unaware of the struggle for rights. Those ‘young’twinks perceive even younger gender-fluid, polyamorous or proudly asexual individ-uals as ‘queerdos,’ and the cycle continues. In this way, we intend to add a dimensionto this book that interrogates the generational differences in attitudes and perspectivesin LGBTQ+ neighborhoods and explore how these generational differences affectthe current functioning and future prospects for LGBTQ+ neighborhoods.The book would not have been possible without contributions from extraordinaryauthor teams fromAustralia, Canada, Belgium, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and theUnited States. These scholars produced top-notch research that challenges assump-tions and forges new intellectual territory in LGBTQ+ studies.

Understanding PopulationChange and Cultural Shifts in LGBTQ+NeighborhoodsDaniel Baldwin Hess and Alex BittermanAbstract Gay neighborhoods, like all neighborhoods, are in a state of continualchange. The relevance of gay neighborhoods—originally formed to promote segre-gation of individuals who identify as sexual minorities—is lately challenged byadvances in technology, experiences with pandemics, shifts in generational opinionand social values, increasing acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals, and (in certainplaces) increased rights and protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. This confluenceof change has created for many people anxiety related to the belief that gay neighbor-hoods may be dissolving or even disappearing altogether. Seeking to address theseconcerns, this opening chapter of the book The Life and Afterlife of Gay Neighbor-hoods: Renaissance and Resurgence presents eight important takeaway messagesdistilled from the chapters in this volume that, taken together, provide an in-depthoverview of the formation, maturation, current challenges, and future prospects ofLGBTQ+ spaces in urban environments. Findings suggest that shifts in patternsof residence, socialization, and entertainment for LGBTQ+ residents and visitorsacross metropolitan space have resulted in certain gay neighborhoods becoming lessgay while other neighborhoods become more gay. In this time of social change,economic inequities, public health crises, and technological evolution, gay neigh-borhoods provide a culturally and historically significant template for communitiesin confronting adversity, fear, and discrimination. At this point in their maturity,gay neighborhoods have reached a plateau in their evolution; from here we pause toconsider the current state of gay neighborhoods—and trajectories that might describetheir future form—as we contemplate the importance of gay neighborhoods in theongoing advancement of LGBTQ+ people everywhere. We conclude by observingthat while gayborhoods have experienced a certain level of de-gaying, the trendtoward viewing gayborhoods as inclusive and gay-friendly places de-emphasizes theself-segregation aspects of gayborhoods thatwere important to their initial formation;D.

Shades of the rainbowumbrella denote various identities of individuals:gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans+, queer, questioning, intersex, allies, and others. Thoughall of these groups live outside the heteronormativemainstream, little else in commonis shared among somemembers of these groups. Apart from identifying as LGBTQ+,a high-income Black female cis-gendered lesbian, for example, in her journey tounderstand and express her own sexual orientation, may have little in common witha middle-income gay gender-queer Asian male who both may have little in commonwith a middle-age White gender-nonconforming trans individual quietly exploringbisexuality at mid-life. All, however, may potentially share in the experience offeeling “othered,” or living outside of predominant heteronormative society.CNN anchor Anderson Cooper (who identifies as gay) while speaking with pres-idential candidate Pete Buttigieg (who also identifies as gay) during the U.S. Demo-cratic Presidential Candidates Town Hall in April 2019, reflected that though theLGBTQ+ acronym contains many divisions of identity, the groups contained withinreflect people who share vastly different experiences. Cooper questioned the value ofsuch a broadly inclusive umbrella and suggested that those who identify as LBGTQ+are nonetheless united in that they live outside what is considered to be the main-stream norm (CNN 2019). Examined in this way, the term “out” may refer metaphor-ically to exiting the proverbial closet, but may also refer to stepping outside of theheteronormative mainstream. Cooper’s observation calls attention to a heteronorma-tive propensity to generically lump all sexual minorities under a broad LGBTQ+umbrella, but further raises the question of what homonormative might look like.Perceived differences between heteronormative and LGBTQ+-normative creates anovergeneralized binary that become especially problematic when researching “gay”neighborhoods.Over the past five decades or so, LGBTQ+ individuals, couples, and families havemade their homes in gay enclaves in cities around the globe. Nonconformity is onecommonality among the various identities allied under the LGBTQ+ umbrella andwhile life challenges may be different among certain subgroups, members of theLGBTQ+ community maintain respect for the relations between the subgroups asa means of self-preservation. For LGBTQ+ people, “gayborhoods” provide spacesfor group members to come together and forge collective experiences (Ghaziani1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 52015b) and to confront shared challenges that LGBTQ+ people have faced for manydecades (Chauncey 2008; Seidman 2004). Gay neighborhoods embody this struggleand have been closely linked to the nascent days in the fight for LGBTQ+ recogni-tion, equality, and civil rights. LGBTQ+ people are not unique in this regard. Manyminorities and subgroups form communities, and neighborhoods are the physicalmanifestation of these communities. Gay neighborhoods cater to and provide safeharbor for LGBTQ+ residents, citizens, and visitors in settings intended to be sepa-rated froma judgmental or unaccepting heteronormative public. For people outside ofthe LGBTQ+ community, gay neighborhoods are often perceived as “gay ghettoes”(Levine 1979) that may be curious or fun to visit, although populated by “different”or “weird” people—affectionately “queerdos” (Kane 2020). It is these differencesthat fuel a grassroots mobilization among LGBTQ+ people to persevere throughadversity; gay neighborhoods thus serve as incubators for empowerment and socialchange and serve as home base for social movements and the fight for equality thatultimately benefits every corner of society.Challenges are not unknown to residents of gay neighborhoods.We find ourselvesin 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, forty-odd years following the startof the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and it has re-ignited faintly familiar fears in gay neigh-borhoods (and beyond) relating to an emerging, mysterious, and deadly contagiousdisease (see Fig. 1.1). Gay neighborhoods were among the first to experience theHIV/AIDS pandemic in the 1980s and the disease proved to be both formative andformidable. The unseen gay population was further marginalized and stigmatizedduring the AIDS pandemic, but residents of gay neighborhoods—along with thebroader LGBTQ+ community and its allies—rose to the challenge of fighting thedeadly pandemic. Gay neighborhoods fostered brave pioneers and some of the veryfirst efforts to assist people with AIDS, to unselfishly raise awareness among thegeneral public about safe sex (when governments were unwilling to do so), andto nurture the value of human life amid profoundly changing circumstances. As aresult, gay neighborhoods provide a template of successful place- and community-based adaptation and evolution in maintaining regularity during a pandemic whennothing seems normal. Gay neighborhoods, despite being perceived by some as“other” or “different” can in this way provide much-needed anchors of normalcy andperseverance for broader society.6 D. B. Hess and A. BittermanFig. 1.1 In Chicago and other cities, residents of gay neighborhoods adapt to COVID-19 guidelinesincluding mask wearing and spatial distancing (Source Image courtesy of William Ivancic)1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 71.2 Nomenclature: Everyone BelongsThe semantics of “gay” have changed over time and these changes reflect shifts inattitude and shifts in the evolution of mainstream perception. Gay “liberation” duringthe 1960s evolved into gay “freedom” in the 1970s which evolved into gay “pride”in the 1990s, and this progression was interrupted in the 1980s by the HIV/AIDSpandemic and the call to power for all LGBTQ+ individuals to “Act Up” for theright to live free from social stigma. We begin by defining the LGBTQ+ popula-tion as consisting of individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgenderand transsexual, queer, questioning, intersex, and other sexual minorities. Individ-uals self-identify and choose to become members of the LGBTQ+ community. Thegroup is inclusive because the community includesmembers of these sexual minoritygroups (and their allies), and everyone is welcome to be part. Throughout this chapterand this book we use the acronym LGBTQ+ to signify a broad cultural group (otherchapter authors may employ different terminology or acronyms). In editing thisvolume, we have treated the terms “gay,” “homosexual,” “queer” as synonymous andas synonyms for the LGBTQ+ acronym as a means to broadly examine the group andits importance along with specific, identifiable urban spaces for sexual minorities.However, we fully acknowledge that the meanings of these words to those in thecommunity differ significantly, and we further recognize the important scholarshipabout the unique experiences of various sexual minorities (Black et al. 2002; Doan2007; Gieseking 2020; Hemmings 2002; Nash andGorman-Murray 2015b; Podmore2001). It is not our intention to simplify or generalize this complex and diverse group.We understand and acknowledge the imprecision of the LGBTQ+ acronym in thatit may make generic the individuals and individualism among its constituent groupsand, as noted above, the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals in and among thesegroups may greatly vary. In this vein, although many gay neighborhoods were histor-ically anchored by a population of gay cis men (Chauncey 2008; Podmore 2021),we consider a “gay” neighborhood to be urban space with some degree of toler-ance inclusive of gay men, lesbian women, trans+ individuals, intersex individuals,questioning individuals, and various other sexual minorities.Living among like-minded people, LGBTQ+ residents sought collective secu-rity to address their feelings of disenfranchisement and safeguard against oppres-sion manifested in hostility and violence (Lauria and Knopp 1985). In this way,gayborhoods served as refuges from persecution and provided affirming space formarginalized groups. Throughout this chapter and this book, we consider a neighbor-hood to be a basic building block of a city (Forsyth 2001), and for convenience weinterchangeably use the terms “gayborhood,” “gay neighborhood,” “gay enclave,”“gay district,” “gay village” and “LGBTQ+ neighborhood”; we acknowledge thelimitations of these labels. We recognize that our decision to use the term “gay”to describe neighborhoods is imprecise because sometimes the term relates to gaymen but other times it relates to everyone under the LGBTQ+ umbrella (such aswhen used to denote “gay” pride, which would more accurately be labeled LGBTQ+pride). Nonetheless, we seek to probe the emergence, evolution, and potential future8 D. B. Hess and A. Bittermantrajectory of LGBTQ+ spaces in urban environments. It is our sincere hope thatover time and with greater study, that these terms can be calibrated and standardizedamong various disciplines and used in a manner that more accurately captures theindividuality of those represented.1.3 The Other: Refuge and Refusal to ChangeFor the greater part of the twentieth century, people identifying or classified asLGBTQ+ were considered by doctors, police officers, teachers, and other authorityfigures to be sexually deviant and were often publicly referred to in this way(including labels such as “the degenerates of Greenwich Village” [Duberman 1991]).Perceived sexual deviance was closely associated with dangerous and communi-cable criminality. The stigma associated with homosexuality remained throughoutthe twentieth century as authorities openly harassed LGBTQ+ individuals and turneda purposeful or delinquent eye to their rightful protection. Indeed, in many jurisdic-tions, homosexuality until relatively recently was illegal, and in some places acrossthe globe remains illegal. The anxiety and fear experienced by LGBTQ+ individualsas a consequence of this environment of stigma and persecution resulted in a socialstigma that kept many LGBTQ+ individuals closeted. Gay neighborhoods emergedover this period as a safe haven for free expression and a respite for all manner ofpeople ostracized or shunned by mainstream society from prosecution, judgement,and violence.Many gay neighborhoods were seeded in the settlement and movement pattern ofsexual minorities beginning in the first half of the twentieth century, and the historyof gay neighborhoods is well documented in literature (Chauncey 2008; Ghaziani2015a; Higgs 1999; Niedt 2021; Orne 2017). The neighborhoods began coalescing inthe 1930s, becoming first identifiable in large cities followingWorld War II, but roseto prominence in the 1980s and 1990s partially in response to civil rights struggles andsexual liberation in the 1960s and1970s and later by theHIV/AIDSpandemic.Duringthe second half of the twentieth century, recognizable gay neighborhoods emergedin various cities around the world at different times and different rates of settlement.Large urban centers were generally the destination of the “great gay migration” ofthe post-World War II decades. Original and iconic LGBTQ+ neighborhoods—inlarge cities such as Berlin (Schöneberg), Istanbul (Taksim Square), London (LittleCompton Street), Los Angeles (West Hollywood, which became America’s firstgay city), Mexico City (Zona Rosa), Miami (South Beach), New York (GreenwichVillage and Chelsea), Paris (LeMarais), Sydney (Oxford Street), San Francisco (theCastro), São Paulo (Rua Frei Caneca), Tokyo (Ni-chōme), Toronto (Church Street),and Washington, DC (DuPont Circle)—catered mainly to gay men (lesbians oftendid not have a notable presence). Each gay neighborhood has its own unique reasonsfor being and circumstances for development (Gorman-Murray and Nash 2021) andconsequently the development and evolution of individual gayborhoods differs.1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 9Within large urban centers—perceived as the “natural space” for gays andlesbians (Higgs 1999)—opportunities in gay neighborhoods for leisure and social-ization brought together the formative elements for the development of community.Gay neighborhoods have provided individuals with opportunities to develop socialnetworks, to date, and to form relationships (Aldrich 2004; Weinke et al. 2021)and gayborhoods became the center point of social events including gay-themedparties, dances, parades, and street fairs (Bruce 2016; Stone 2021). All of these eventshelped LGBTQ+ community members to locate their status outside the mainstream.In this way, LGBTQ+ neighborhoods provided a supportive community structurewhich helped LGBTQ+ individuals to succeed. The social and “party” dimensionhas always been part of the perception of gay villages, where gay men were assumedto engage in frivolity and promiscuity far from the castigating eye of heteronormativesociety (see Fig. 1.2). As LGBTQ+ neighborhoods began to mature in the 1980s and1990s, gay villages served a central role in delivering health-supportive services—including HIV prevention and clinics, doctor’s offices, counseling services—relatedto the AIDS pandemic (Ghaziani 2021) as well as mental health resources (Weinkeet al. 2021) and social services for displaced and homeless LGBTQ+ youth shunnedor ostracized by families. Later, in the 2000s, these same communities became theorganizing centers for supporting same-sex marriage and equality.Many people identifying as LGBTQ+ seek freedom of personal expression, whileothers seek anonymity in gay neighborhoods, where they can live their lives freeof judgement or persecution. Centripetal forces serve as the attractions that drawLGBTQ+ people (and others) toward a gayborhood due to the shared benefits derivedfrom a sense of tolerance and belonging (Doan andAtalay 2021). Surrounded by like-minded others, gay men and lesbian women feel more comfortable on city streets ingayborhoods due to attitudes of acceptance and a sense of comfort and belonging, andLGBTQ+ residents and visitors felt more free here compared to other places in cities.Gay neighborhoods and their residents have been widely accepted as significantforces in leading and advocating for positive urban change and have reduced theeffects of LGBTQ+ minority status by helping to enhance people’s understandingabout sexual minorities (Doan and Higgins 2011; Gorman-Murray and Nash 2021),and LGBTQ+ community members—and indeed all of society—can experience animproved quality of life when there is an increased level of tolerance.Gay neighborhoods also provided a means of entry for mainstream society tobetter understand LGBTQ+ individuals and LGBTQ+ culture. However, as muchas heteronormative society identified gay neighborhoods as different or “other,” gayneighborhoods also became places that inclusively celebrated “the other.” In additionto sexual minorities who lived apart from the mainstream, other alternative groups—hippies, punk rockers, prostitutes—could find a home in gayborhoods (Ross andSullivan 2012). The influence of gay neighborhoods on popular culture—music,theatre, writing, visual arts—especially in the latter half of the twentieth and earlytwenty-first centuries is especially notable.10 D. B. Hess and A. BittermanFig. 1.2 The gay village in Manchester, England, surrounds Canal Street and is one of the largestgay neighborhoods anywhere (Source Image courtesy of Daniel Baldwin Hess)1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 111.4 Marginal to Memorable: The Evolution of GayNeighborhoodsGay neighborhoods have often been located in disused fringe locations or undesir-able areas of cities where space was available and real estate and rents were cheap. Inthese off-the-beaten-path neighborhoods, gay men and lesbian women could estab-lish homes and businesses with less fear of being bothered by others or by theauthorities, and LGBTQ+ customers could enjoy service without fear of rejection,persecution, or harassment. Property owners in LGBTQ+ neighborhoods renovatedbuildings and performed various acts of inner-city preservation bringing value tothe properties through sweat equity. Gay neighborhood leaders worked to landmarkand preserve places significant to LGBTQ+ history (Miller and Bitterman 2021).As a result, these gay neighborhoods were usually passed over for large publicly-funded urban renewal projects (Gorman-Murray and Nash 2021), thereby protectingthe integrity of the built environment and often sparing these neighborhoods fromthe urban planning missteps common in the mid- to late-twentieth century (Jacobs1961). This grassroots-level of active preservation and advocacy spared the architec-tural integrity of neighborhoods—like the meatpacking district in New York City,the South End in Boston, and countless others—and helped to successful reintegratethese neighborhoods into the urban fabric of today.As understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ+ people continued to grow,LGBTQ+ neighborhoods often became home to the popular culture vanguardthat welcomed, in addition to LGBTQ+ individuals, straight mainstream visitors,bohemian artists, and the cultural avant garde. Gay villages cultivated a reputationfor restaurants, music scenes, boutiques, and hipster culture (Podmore 2021), thanksto LGBTQ+ pioneers who moved in and settled these places and attracted the pinkeconomy to form around them (Ghaziani 2021). Bars, nightlife, parties, and prideparades became further attractors to gay neighborhoods (see Fig. 1.3). Gay districtsin large world cities became tourist destinations, and LGBTQ+ neighborhoods flour-ished “by commodifying the diversity, cosmopolitanism and lifestyle of the innercity” (Nash and Gorman-Murray 2015a, 98). As cultural and economic engines, gayneighborhoods also help to support the vitality of adjacent neighborhoods. In somecities, a “city of neighborhoods” scheme emphasizes gay neighborhoods as culturalanchors that draw tourists, visitors, and residents away from well-known areas likecity centers (Gorman-Murray and Nash 2021).While gay neighborhoods first emerged as marginal outposts, many have trans-formed (and gentrified) in the last few decades to become universally sought-afterdistricts. Nearly two decades ago, Richard Florida (2004) published a study of“creative places”—locales having the power to attract economic development andfoster urban vibrancy—suggesting that concentrations of LGBTQ+ residents formthe center of an educated and creative community, contributing to the developmentof local amenities and increases in property values.12 D. B. Hess and A. BittermanFig. 1.3 Gay bars are anchor institutions in the Stanley Street Gay Quarter in Liverpool, England(Source Image courtesy of Daniel Baldwin Hess)1.4.1 The First Great PlateauOver the last two decades many historically gay neighborhoods—such as the Castroin San Francisco andWest Hollywood in Los Angeles—have experienced significantdemographic change (Bitterman 2020; Hess 2019; Spring 2021;Weinke et al. 2021).Soaring property taxes, rents, and property values—ingredients for hypergentrifica-tion—have drivenmany sexualminorities away from these areas,whilemany affluentstraight professionals and their families have moved into replace them (Christaforeand Leguizamon 2018; Ghaziani 2014). With a rise in property values, more affluentpeople relocate to gay districts and low- andmiddle-income people have been pushedaway (Moss 2017; Zukin 1998). Increases in the number of condominium dwellersare notable, as non-LGBTQ+ residents are attracted by neighborhood amenities andthe carefree cachet of hip urban living, triggering centrifugal forces that push peopleaway from gayborhoods (Doan and Atalay 2021). Since 2000, a process of “de-gaying,” during which non-LGBTQ+ people were attracted to gayborhoods (eitherfor entertainment or as residential space), many gayborhoods lost “anchor” institu-tions, epitomized by the large-scale closure of gay bookstores and gay bars (Eeckhoutet al. 2021; Mattson 2019). Neighborhood commercial strips in gayborhoods havebeen replaced by nightlife venues intended to attract mixed or straight crowds (seeFig. 1.4). As a result, the pink economy has changed significantly (Ghaziani 2021)1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 13Fig. 1.4 The Zona Rosa (“Pink Zone” in English) is located near the historic center of Mexico Cityand features retail outlets and nightlife venues amid a gay community (Source Image courtesy ofDaniel Baldwin Hess)suggesting a slow erasure of LGBTQ+ culture in gay neighborhoods. The closureof iconic gay meeting places, given their importance in sexual minty communities,was often a “turning point” in the decline of gay villages (Doan and Atalay 2021).Established gay neighborhoods now embody a virtual dimension for LGBTQ+connection (Miles 2021), perhaps redefining the importance of physical place.Compared to mainstream heteronormative communities, LGBTQ+ communitiesfostered early adoption of technology as a means to augment/enhance physicalcommunities. This newfound reliance on digital technology in gay neighborhoods(largely as a means to take advantage of propinquity) has become increasinglycommon. Compared to other types of neighborhoods, these digital connections mayprovide one potential avenue for future sustenance of gay neighborhoods. However,with this shift, some anxiety has arisen among the denizens of LGBTQ+ neighbor-hoods about the perceived demise the incidental physical importance of these spaceswhich may have interrupted the continuity among LGBTQ+ generational cohortsand accentuated disconnects between various groups under the LGBTQ+ umbrella(Bitterman and Hess 2021). The closure of gay bars, emerging virtual gay spaces,generational disconnect, and changes in the character of gay neighborhoods arereminders that as these places transition from being home to generations rooted in14 D. B. Hess and A. Bittermanstruggle to playgrounds of generations benefitting from that struggle, now may be agermane time to examine the present plateau in the trajectory of gay neighborhoods.1.5 Empirical Plan for This BookDrawing on a tradition of scholarship about the spatial basis of LGBTQ+ iden-tity (Binnie and Valentine 1999), this book explores perspectives about the past,current, and future conditions of gay districts in cities as a means to better under-stand the ongoing evolution of gay neighborhoods. We begin by clarifying the roleof gayborhoods—home to constituent members of the LGBTQ+ rainbow—as placesthat celebrated “the other” and became the site of sexual liberation from the 1970sto the 1990s (Castells 1983). We are motivated to explore the current plateau inthe evolution of gay neighborhoods. We also wish to explore whether gay neighbor-hoods are declining or are simply evolving, and—in an age of digital connectivity thatreplaces person connection—the comfort LGBTQ+ individuals experience living aspart the heteronormativemainstream.As the stigma associatedwith LGBTQ+groupsdecreases, there are changes in people’s needs and desires for living in gay districts(places that initially promoted isolation over integration).Like all neighborhoods, gay neighborhoods and the dynamics that shape them areunique. This book addresses questions related to the necessity and demand for gayneighborhoods in the future as LGBTQ+ people become more accepted as part ofmainstream communities. We expect to see new types of gay communities emerge inthe future, especially as the baby boom generation andGeneration X (and subsequentgenerations) age into retirement (Hess 2019; Bitterman and Hess 2021), however,these neighborhoods may be different than those we know today. The local, national,and global upheaval related to the COVID-19 pandemic will likely change howpeople live in and perceive urban neighborhoods, perhaps instigating further—andat present unknowable—transformation to gayborhoods.While recent books have provided various perspectives on the development,growth, and change of gay neighborhoods (Notaro 2020; Ryan 2020; Crawford-Lackey and Springate 2020; Martel et al. 2018; Doan 2015; Ghaziani 2014) andthe changing sexual space of cities (Khubchandani 2020; Nagourney 2019; Contr-eras 2019; Elledge 2018; Evanosky et al. 2018; Orne 2017; Potts 2016; Shaw 2015;Giraud 2014; Murray 2014), this book provides an in-depth exploration of social andcultural phenomena related to the past, present, and future of gay districts. Just asthe LGBTQ+ community continues to grow and evolve, so too have gay neighbor-hoods and gay places continued to grow and evolve. Consequently, chapters withinthe book give special attention to two phenomena in particular: (1) the forces ofgentrification that have changed the character of gay districts during the last twodecades (Hess 2019; Bitterman 2020), pushing out long-time gay and lesbian resi-dents as the number of non-LGBTQ+ residents and visitors increases; and (2) thechanging views toward gayborhoods of successive generations of LGBTQ+ resi-dents, with generational-attitudinal perspectives as a significant factor in changing1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 15Fig. 1.5 An advertisement for a property leasing opportunity on Christopher Street in New YorkCity’s Greenwich Village (Source Image courtesy of Daniel Baldwin Hess)demand among LGTBQ+ groups for gayborhoods (see Fig. 1.5). We believe thatthe interrelation of these factors both shapes and reshapes the lived experience forLGBTQ+people in neighborhoods and cities. As the stigma associatedwithmember-ship in groups under the LGBTQ+umbrella decreases universally, the need/desire forliving in places underscored by segregation and self-isolationmay change in parallel.As gay neighborhoods continue to evolve, one significant and important risk to noteis that the importance of gayborhoods in the struggle for LGBTQ+ recognition andrights may be forgotten or erased.1.5.1 A Note Regarding LimitationsThe geographical reach of the chapters herein is broad, since phenomena relatingto the development, maturation, and life cycle of gay neighborhoods is not uniformfrom country to country or even from city to city (Gorman-Murray and Nash 2021;Doan and Atalay 2021; Bitterman and Hess 2021). This is due to (among otherreasons) incomplete and inconsistent collection of data about LGBTQ+ individ-uals and couples (Spring 2021; Frisch 2021) and differing laws and legal protec-tions for LGBTQ+ individuals from place to place. Accuracy of broadly applicable16 D. B. Hess and A. Bittermanassessments regarding “the emergence of” or “the death of” gay neighborhoods ischallenging given these legal, social, and economic landscapes and what may behappening in one gay neighborhood may not parallel what is happening in another.We acknowledge the various limitations that this edited volume presents. Chiefamong these is an under-representation of scholarship from countries and cities inthe Global South (Brown et al. 2010). LGBTQ+ civil rights in many countries acrossthe Global South, parts of Asia, and former Soviet republics are less secure thanin countries in the Global North and the West. For this reason, some researchersand scholars from countries in the Global South are unable to conduct researchor publish works about LGBTQ+ issues and communities without significant riskto their professional careers or their personal safety. It is our sincere hope that bymaking this book broadly available, we can create and support future opportunitiesfor researchers, policymakers, and advocates committed to understanding and evalu-ating civil rightsmovements for LGBTQ+ individuals across theGlobal South.Whilehumbly acknowledging the geographic limits presented in this volume, we hopethat our contributions in this volume to LGBTQ+ scholarship can help further thegeographic reach of this research and support future research as voices in commonlyunderrepresented areas bravely emerge. Support of this volume from colleaguesacross the Global South is an important formative step toward increasing globalawareness, recognition, and societal equality for all LGBTQ+ individuals. Simi-larly, space consideration in this volume prevented us from giving full attention toLGBTQ+ communities in non-metropolitan spaces (Binnie 2014; Tongson 2011)but our hope is that the research presented here can provide a springboard for othersengaging in future research in locales not fully represented in this book.1.6 Takeaway MessagesThe chapters in this volume are constructed in an effort to provide a snapshot of thestate of gay neighborhoods in 2021 and beyond. We next offer the following eightsynthetic takeaway messages, distilled from the seventeen chapters in this book.Takeaway message 1. Gay neighborhoods are inclusive and are not only for gaymen.The term “gay” as a shorthand descriptor in the label for “gay neighborhoods”effectively ignores the multipolar diversity among the LGBTQ+ population (as notedin the “nomenclature” section above). The array of groups represented under theLGBTQ+ banner may share similar journeys but collectively each subgroup hasunique challenges not commonly shared among other sectors of the broader LGBTQ+community. Therefore, the term “gay neighborhood” may unintentionally suggestexclusive focus on one specific group—gay men—and not fully reflect the entireinclusive LGBTQ+ rainbow.Established largely by gay men, the first gay neighborhoods over time becameincreasingly defined by inclusivity especially through tolerance of—and kinship1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 17with—other sexual minorities, the artistic and creative avant garde, and affluentstraight urban professionals. However, these spaces were often viewed by othermembers of the LGBTQ+ community predominantly as gay male space, andas a result of their gay male origins many lesbian women, bisexual individuals,and trans+ individuals are consequently less likely to feel a resonant connec-tion with gay neighborhoods. “Gay” male influence in the establishment of gayneighborhoods is still prevalent, but not exclusive.The attraction between gay neighborhoods and cultural trendsetters continuestoday. The distinction between gay neighborhoods and hipster neighborhoodsbecomes increasingly less clear in neighborhoods recognized for their high sharesof sexual minorities (Podmore 2021) and sexual fluidity among younger gener-ations shifts the generational perspective of gay neighborhoods (Bitterman andHess 2021). As these emerging generational trends become increasingly normal-ized, the notion of gay neighborhoods demarcated by geographic boundaries maybecome more challenging for scholars to effectively measure and less relevant tothose interested in living there. As Podmore observes (2021, 303): “because thesexual identity of hipster men was ambiguous, their presence could evacuate thearea of the hegemonic norms of masculinity that might exist elsewhere.”Takeaway message 2. Gay neighborhoods matter.Gay neighborhoods matter to everyone and are important—both historically andcurrently—to the functioning of contemporary urban culture; gay neighborhoodssupport the health and well-being of both LGBTQ+ individuals as well as mainstreamsociety.Gay neighborhoods emerged in the 1950s and 1960s in large cities as a respitefrom the critical and shunning eye of mainstream society and overt harassmentby authorities. The natural tendency to surround oneself with similar people whoshare common experiences—known as homophily—underscores the fundamentalattraction toward gay neighborhoods (McPherson et al. 2001). Often located indisused urban space, early gay neighborhoods emerged from bohemian enclaveswhich served as nexuses for a fledgling gay culture thatwas equated inmainstreamsociety with criminality and deviance. Initially, gay neighborhoods provided adegree of protection from police harassment (safety in numbers) in peripheralurban spaces outside of the public eye. LGBTQ+ neighborhoods also give peoplewho identify as sexualminorities a feeling of safety—due to the a perceived feelingof acceptance—compared to other places throughout a city where tolerance forLGBTQ+ individualsmay be lesser. Gay neighborhoods provide positive benefits.Living among other LGBTQ+ people, gay neighborhoods help fulfill the humandesire to build community and capacity for self-actualization, since thosewho livein areas with higher densities of sexual minorities have lower rates of depressionsymptoms and higher levels of self-esteem (Weinke et al. 2021).Gayborhoods help raise the visibility and advance the cause of sexual minori-ties under the LGBTQ+ umbrella (though at differing rates for each of thevarious groups). Clustering in certain neighborhoods, LGBTQ+ people have18 D. B. Hess and A. Bittermanraised their visibility and have formed (largely liberal or progressive) voting blocsthat help achieve political and social gains. In addition to political functions ofvoting and elections, Ghaziani (2021) identifies other reasons that gay neighbor-hoods matter, including providing space to build community and nurture relation-ships, promoting the pink economy, and supporting political action and activism(Bitterman and Hess 2016b). Most LGBTQ+ neighborhoods develop formal andinformal support services to improve life quality for all. Without gayborhoods,LGBTQ+ people risk becoming marginalized and under threat of possibly losingrights and liberties they have fought to win (Ghaziani 2021). Over time, the impor-tance of gay neighborhoods solidified as they became the nexus of—at first—thestruggle for LGBTQ+ civil rights. However, as the HIV/AIDS pandemic emergedin the 1980s, gay neighborhoods became important centers in the fight against thedisease, against ignorance, and against stigma due to illness. Gay neighborhoodslater served as the organizational center for pride events which helped to introducegay life to mainstream culture and established the conditions that eventually madeway for legalizing same-sex marriage.Gay neighborhoods remain the physicalmonument to decades of struggle, oppres-sion, and violence. In more recent years, challenges and milestones have beencelebrated through LGBTQ+ archives, museums, and exhibits in gayborhoodsthat educate younger generations about past efforts to secure equality and rightsand violence against LGBTQ+ individuals (Miller and Bitterman 2021). Gayneighborhoods, throughout each of these eras, have largely provided a welcomeand accepting urban space for sexual minorities, LGBTQ+ singles, couples, andfamilies who choose to live there or visit.Takeaway message 3. Gay neighborhoods are becoming less gay.The trend toward inclusivity may be “de-gaying” gay neighborhoods. As formerlyexclusive gay neighborhoods (and gay places within them) have broadened to include“gay friendly,” many gay neighborhoods have attracted straight people as residentsand visitors, a phenomenon that dilutes the exclusivity and collective safety offeredby gay neighborhoods. Along with broader societal forces and greater mainstreamacceptance, heteronormatizing gayborhoods has diminished the need for LGBTQ+individuals to retreat to or self -segregate into gay spaces.As they matured, gay neighborhoods transitioned from destinations primarily forsocialization (in bars, restaurants, cafes, and bookstores) to places for residence,where LGBTQ+ people established their homes and built community (Niedt2021). More recently, as gayborhoods gentrify, heterosexual people have movedin and gay neighborhoods have become attractive mixed-use residential neighbor-hoods containing amenitieswith broad appeal andprogressive cachet. The conven-tional concept of a gay neighborhood (a “village” with amix of everyday services,modeled on Greenwich Village in New York City) is being replaced throughdemographic shifts by “emerging” LGBTQ+ places in urban-metropolitan space(Bitterman 2020; Hess 2019). The emergence of gay neighborhoods in othersettings reflects a redefinition of what is important in residential environments1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 19and surrounding communities for LGBTQ+ individuals and same-sex couples,resulting in “a new normal” for gay neighborhoods. These “emerging” placeslikely contain neighborhood services and amenities that have not in the past beenstrongly associated with gayborhoods.Examples of the “de-gaying” and the evolution of LGBTQ+ neighborhoods areplentiful. Across Atlanta, this phenomenon produces an outward centrifugalforce that redistributes LGBTQ+ residents from gayborhoods to other places(Doan and Atalay 2021). This dispersal is evident by the decentralized displayof symbols associated with gay pride and gay neighborhoods (some of which areshown in Fig. 1.6)—pink triangles, rainbow flags, and equality symbols—thatare dispersing across metropolitan space and becoming more ubiquitous. This“rainbow diaspora” has produced a measurable increase in the visual displayof the rainbow flag in neighborhoods in Toronto—diffused from the histori-cally gay Church-Wellesley neighborhood—into the Parkdale and Roncesvallesneighborhoods and across the city (Bitterman 2021). These integrative examplessuggests both greater acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals and greater dispersionof LGBTQ+ individuals from specific gayborhoods.Following legislative and social advances—including human rights protections,civil rights, and same-sex marriage—LGBTQ+ people have over recent yearsbecome increasingly more visible across a variety of locations and are lesslikely to be confined to or concentrated in gay neighborhoods (Gorman-Murrayand Nash 2021). However, just as compelling as the places LGBTQ+ peoplechoose to live is where LGBTQ+ individuals do not live. For example, fewgay couples live in the suburbs: “quintessentially suburban neighborhoods haveremained closed-off to male same-sex partners, even within a larger MSA contextof declining segregation” (Spring 2021, 51). The most inaccessible places forsome male same-sex couples, for example, include economically vibrant, “child-friendly,” mostly suburban neighborhoods where they may feel unwelcome or notaccepted (Spring 2021), which demonstrates difference in essential requirementsfor different groups under the LGBTQ+ umbrella to create gay neighborhoods.Moreover, recent demographic research suggests that many individuals residingtoday in neighborhoods with high concentrations of sexual minorities do notthemselves identify as sexual minority (Spring 2021; Weinke et al. 2021) andnon-minority heterosexuals constitute the majority (Carpiano et al. 2011). Repo-sitioning gay villages as the nexus of LGBTQ+ or queer urban space addresses thecriticism that gayborhoods arewelcomingmostly to gaymen and to a lesser extent,lesbians, and even less to queer people who are not out, questioning, or do notidentify as either gay or lesbian (Wolf 1979). As the inclusivity of the LGBTQ+umbrella encompasses more difference, the term “gay” becomes increasinglygeneralized and itsmeaning diluted. In thisway, the term “gay” is used as a genericshorthand for all LGBTQ+ people, which potentially leads to “diversification ofthe term to the point ofmeaningless homogenization” (Bitterman 2020, 100). Thatis, as the LGBTQ+ umbrella has expanded to encompass more diverse groups, the20 D. B. Hess and A. BittermanFig. 1.6 Banners depicting the rainbowflag adorn streetlamp in the Castro in San Francisco (SourceImage courtesy of Daniel Baldwin Hess)1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 21relative life experience of members of LGBTQ+ subgroups may be less compa-rable and less interconnected especially when overlaid by other understandingsand complexities related to diversity. The effects of this hyper-inclusivity mayresult in an unintended dilution of gay neighborhoods by “de-gaying” the veryneighborhoods meant to protect and empower LGBTQ+ people.During the 1990s and 2000s, a dramatic decline occurred in the number of gay barsin gayborhoods (Eeckhout et al. 2021; Mattson 2019). See Fig. 1.7. An increaseddemand for larger venues for staging expansive organized parties reduced thedemand for smaller neighborhood bars, and gay-friendly mega clubs offeredopportunities for more entertainment spectacle in mixed parties. This loss ofregular neighborhood bars has reduced opportunities for social mixing amongLGBTQ+ people from various generations (Bitterman and Hess 2021; Eeckhoutet al. 2021). While previous generations of gay men preferred to socialize inbars visited strictly by gay men, those attending parties in gay neighborhoodstoday seek inclusive “gay friendly” dances and events (Eeckhout et al. 2021):“the relatively exclusive, niche-specific, semi-public spaces of lesbian and gaybars that promised a safe haven in a largely hostile environment lost their raisond’être faster than anyone would have expected a few decades ago” (Eeckhoutet al. 2021, 238). These changes in how LGBTQ+ individuals socialize in gayFig. 1.7 Bars and nightclubs are prominent in the Zona Rosa (“Pink Zone” in English) in MexicoCity (Source Image courtesy of Daniel Baldwin Hess)22 D. B. Hess and A. Bittermanneighborhoods underscores broader societal shifts among younger generations(Bitterman and Hess 2021).Among those traditionally not found beneath the LGBTQ+ umbrella, genderfluidity and diversity of gender expression—long conflated with homosexualityand “being gay”—has become more clearly articulated and is becoming moresocially accepted. Shifting perceptions of gender, gender identity and fluidity, andgender expression—paralleling the rise of “gay friendly” culture—have given abroader mainstream voice to queer culture (Seidman 1994). Amalgamations ofwords that reference homosexuality as a cultural touchpoint are becoming increas-ingly common. For example, “metrosexual”—a straight male with groominghabits or fashion-conscious proclivities typically associated with gay men—isone example of this cross-over. Similarly, a “lumbersexual”, is a homosexualwith certain “butch” characteristics (manner or dress) reminiscent of a lumberjack.“Cuomosexuals” are those individuals who appreciate the efforts of New YorkState Governor Andrew Cuomo, especially in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic(Miles et al. 2021). In contrast to the “de-gaying” of gay neighborhoods, thisshift could be considered the “gaying” of heteronormative society. Observing themore recent blurring of differentiation between queer culture and hipster culturein the gay village of Montréal, Podmore (2021, 303) argues that “the boundariesbetween hipsters and queers were blurred rendering all young people inMile-Endas queer.”Many LGBTQ+ individuals today—especially younger groups—embrace abroadly inclusive definition of sexual orientation and find little value in labels suchas “gay,” “lesbian,” “transgender,” and other sexual minority groups (Podmore2021). These younger individuals may view gayborhoods as relics of the past, ormay find gay neighborhoods not to be welcoming in ways that match contempo-rary sensitivities toward inclusivity (Bitterman and Hess 2021). In the same way,the older cohort in gayborhoods is often less comfortable with the sexual diversitythat younger people easily accept nor the sexual fluidity theymaypractice. It canbedifficult to distinguish between queer and hipster, and the hipster aesthetic marksgayborhoods as distinctly non-heteronormative space. For non-LGBTQ+ indi-viduals, “the idea that sharing space with hipsters serves to disrupt heterosexualnorms and to recode the spaces as progressive, creative and open” (Podmore 2021,304). This is a reminder that we now live in a post-binary multipolar world (Hess2019) and this change is reflected in neighborhoods and places. These social shiftsrepresent significant changes in thinking and perspective underpinning genera-tional change. A tendency for younger groups to embrace less prescriptive anddefined gender and sexual orientation will likely impact gay neighborhoods andindeed all neighborhoods (Bitterman and Hess 2021).The “de-gaying” of gay neighborhoods has elevated their visibility but also theirvulnerability. Gay neighborhoods, as places favored by LGBTQ+ people to visitfor entertainment and socialization and to reside in, also provide space for thosewho do not identify as sexual minorities. Research by Nash and Gorman-Murray1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 23(2014) suggests that rather thanunderstanding changinggendered and sexual land-scapes as manifestations of decline, it is more suitable to understand gayborhoodsas part of relational geographies between neighborhoods supporting visible queerpopulations and marking greater social cohesion. Groups of people may now visitgayborhoods who would not have done so when gayborhoods were seen strictlyas playgrounds for gay men.Many researchers have investigated the impact of gentrification on gay villagesincluding the displacement of LGBTQ+ commerce and households and the “de-gaying” or the loss of LGBTQ+ consumers and the integration of the broaderpublic into local markets (Doan and Higgins 2011; Ghaziani 2014; Gorman-Murray and Nash 2016; Ruting 2008). We conclude this section by observing thatwhile gayborhoods have experienced a certain level of de-gaying, the trend towardviewing gayborhoods as inclusive and gay-friendly places de-emphasizes the self-segregation aspects of gayborhoods that were important to their initial formation(Moss 2017); while gay neighborhoods become less gay, other neighborhoodsbecome more gay.Takeaway message 4. Virtual connections enhance gay neighborhoods.Contrary to the perception that technological change—online presence and virtualconnection through social media (dating and hook-up apps)—has hastened thedecline of gayborhoods by reducing the need for physical presence, we argue thattechnology enhances rather than replaces the social aspects of gay neighborhoods.During the last decade a broad proliferation of location-based smartphone datingand hook-up apps including Grindr, FindHrr, Scruff, and others have replacedInternet dating websites from the 1990s and 2000s, such as Adam to Adam andPlanet Romeo. Unlike online dating sites and newspaper personal ads beforethem, these apps offer geocoding that serves to “decenter placemaking efforts”(Ghaziani 2021, 89). Consequently, remarkable changes may be looming:… LGBTIQ life has been transformed by the virtualization of sexual networks in urbanspace as a result of new technologies. Digital, mobile, and social media allow for instan-taneous contact across the globe, allowing LGBTIQs to connect across geographicalboundaries beyond their immediate (urban) dwelling. At the same time, location-basedservices, in particular dating apps such asGrindr, allowLGBTIQs to identify and connectwith other LGBTIQs within their urban or even rural contexts. (Eeckhout et al. 2021,239)Technology, as a consequence, may transform certain functional aspects of gayneighborhoods and render physical proximity less relevant because physicalaspects of gay neighborhoods now have virtual dimensions for LGBTQ+ connec-tion. The centrifugal pull away from gay neighborhoods may shift as a result(Doan and Atalay 2021), because location within in a gay neighborhood or evenin the same city or country is unnecessary to use hook-up apps to find others.Today, most everyone can be connected digitally, since gay dating and hook-upapps transform “any street, park, bar or home into a queer space by brokeringa meeting between mutually attracted individuals” (Miles 2021, 207). In this24 D. B. Hess and A. Bittermanway, any physical locale can acquire a queer overtone when it is employed as ameeting place relating to LGBTQ+ online/virtual connection (Miles 2021), andtechnology is used creatively by LGBTQ+ people as they inhabit gay spaces otherthan gayborhoods (Wu and Ward 2018). In this way, gay neighborhoods couldemerge as neutral and safe “meeting grounds” for hookups and dating. For Miles(2021), this creates in gayborhoods a “hybrid reality” formed from layered phys-ical place and digital space. Consequently, a gay neighborhood can be createdanyplace, enabled by “pre-screening” of people and places in social apps.Online environments and apps may perhaps facilitate the decline of gay neighbor-hoods, permitting LGBTQ+ people to scatter from gay villages to new residentialsettings across metropolitan space: “queer dating and hook-up apps are variouslyblamed for destroying gay neighborhoods and celebrated for reinvigorating them;dismissed as impediments to queer community by some and hypothesized byothers as virtual sites for new and often liberatory communities of their own”(Miles 2021, 210). Smartphone apps, in this way, could be credited as a leadingfactor in LGBTQ+ deconcentration from gayborhoods. Certainly, the ability toconnect with others for sex and dating lessens the centrality of the former go-togay neighborhoods and venues—shops, bars, restaurants, bookstores, communitycenters—within them.Weargue, however, thatwhile online apps enhancephysical space in gayborhoods,they provide an overlay upon lived physical space but do not replace the lived city.In other words, technology overlaps but does not replace propinquity and physicalpresence. Although LGBTQ+ life “has been transformed by the virtualization ofsexual networks in urban space as a result of new technologies” (Eeckhout et al.2021, 238), the importance of place in gayborhoods is not threatened with erasuresolely because of changes in the way LGBTQ+ people use or engage technology.During the early days of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, gay neighborhoods served asground zero for LGBTQ+ activists to organize and demand change. We empha-size the importance of neighborhoods, yet virtual connections for LGBTQ+communitymembers can transcend neighborhoods and go anywhere—both phys-ically/spatially (global) and temporally. If gayborhoods are indeed in decline asphysical spaces, they now—in the Internet age and beyond—have an “electronicafterglow” that is embodied in smartphone apps and reflected in people’s indi-vidual and collective digital presence (and the legacy of this presence) (Coffin2021).Digital connectivity has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic (Mileset al. 2021). We conclude this section by noting that various generations ofLGBTQ+ individuals engage technological change differently, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further influenced the way nearly everyone engages technology(Miles 2021). Consequently, we expect that people’s response due to coronavirus-related lockdowns will further shift how LGBTQ+ people cope with and embracetechnology vis-a-vis the places in which they reside (Miles et al. 2021) and1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 25frequent. In thisway, gay neighborhoodswill likely—stemming from theCOVID-19 pandemic—again become engines of change for LGBTQ+ communities andbeyond.Takeaway message 5. The disappearance of gay neighborhoods could diminishsafe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals.The perceived decline of gay neighborhoods has produced concern and anxietyamong the LGBTQ+population about possible disregard for the original accomplish-ment of establishing gayborhoods as safe and inclusive urban space for LGBTQ+individuals.Gentrification and hypergentrification may slowly edge gay residents and busi-nesses away from gay neighborhoods (Bitterman 2020; Hess 2019; Moss 2017).With closure or displacement of LGBTQ+ residences, bars, businesses, andservices, the “gayness” of gay neighborhoods can be vulnerable to decline, even-tually resulting in destruction or obsolescence that leads to erasure (Eeckhout et al.2021;Mattson 2019). Anxiety and fear related to this potential erasure exposes thevulnerability that LGBTQ+people experience (Weinke et al. 2021) regarding theircomfort with their place in society. Iconic institutions and venues within populargay neighborhoods—bookstores, bars, nightclubs—are closing, and these placeare important to the identity of people in the LGBTQ+ community and may evenhave been part of “coming out” stories. As the LGBTQ+ population share in gayneighborhoods appears to decline—or as the gayborhoods become more “main-stream” and populated by non-LGBTQ+ people—a foreboding sense of potentialand monumental loss of LGBTQ+ spaces and culture emerges. Gorman-MurrayandNash (2021, 250) explain that “anxiety about (gayborhoods”) possible declinehas grown, particularly with the loss of several iconic businesses, rising rentsand an influx of heterosexuals into the condominium market and entertainmentvenues.”Older generations of LGBTQ+ pioneers helped to build gay neighborhoods assafe spaces unthreatened from the harassment and persecution of a hostile world(Bitterman and Hess 2021). These respites provided fertile ground for an earlygeneration of pioneers to organize, mobilize, and activate a wave of advocacyfor LGBTQ+ recognition and rights. These trailblazing generations shifted thepublic perception of “being gay” away from illegality and dereliction towardtolerance and normalcy. The societal stigma attached to being gay was magni-fied during the HIV/AIDS pandemic—and the adversity experienced by gay menduring (and after) that pandemic—reshaped and fueled a generation of LGBTQ+activists, pioneers, and allies (Bitterman and Hess 2021). Challenging those inpower and the institutions of power was no small effort for these trailblazers. Gayneighborhoods served as the geographic centers of a cross-generational move-ment, and gay neighborhoods remain important to the shared cultural memoryof the struggle for dignity, rights, and civil protections—aspects that undergradLGBTQ+ pride celebrations today—for gay men and lesbian women.26 D. B. Hess and A. BittermanHowever, younger generations that did not directly participate in the struggle forLGBTQ+ rights may not fully grasp the importance of gay neighborhoods forLGBTQ+ culture and lesbian and gay life (Bitterman and Hess 2021). This maysignal a disconnect between older and younger LGBTQ+ generations, especiallyas fluidity in gender expression and sexual orientation shifts LGBTQ+ identityamong the younger generations (Bitterman and Hess 2021). As a result, a lack ofcontinuity and awareness may threaten the existence (Podmore 2021) and lastingvalue of gay neighborhoods (Miller and Bitterman 2021). In the United States, anational effort was started during the Obama administration to identify, memo-rialize, and landmark sites that provide significance to the history of LGBTQ+community (Miller and Bitterman 2021). This important endeavor was intendedto affirm the critical importance and relevance of these sites for generations tocome (Bitterman and Hess 2021). The survival of smaller gay districts (and gaydistricts located in small- and mid-sized cities (Forstie 2008)) is more threat-ened than established gay districts in larger metropolitan areas with critical massin LGBTQ+ communities (Ghaziani 2021) and some locations have informallycommemorated LGBTQ+ significant places within or near gay neighborhoods,as shown in Fig. 1.8.The apparent slow erosion of gay neighborhoods, loss of collective identity, andstruggle to preserve historical achievements creates a cultural stress. LGBTQ+people experience stressors over and above the routine stressors that all peopleencounter, increasing the likelihood that minority group members experiencemental health problems (Weinke et al. 2021). LGBTQ+ people have a numberof resources available to them—typically in or near gay neighborhoods—to helpwith “minority coping” related to the “minority stressors” they experience. Inthis way, gay neighborhoods provide various supports to LGBTQ+ individualsand have a positive impact on the mental health of sexual minority young adults,above and beyond the influence of their individual characteristics (Weinke et al.2021). Although multiple factors appear to contribute to sexual minorities’ poorermental health (Weinke et al. 2021), most researchers believe that the stress causedby sexual stigma and prejudice is the most significant factor, and gay neighbor-hoods can helpmitigate this stress across the lifespan, though younger generationsnot directly participating in the struggle for LGBTQ+ civil rights may be unawareof the importance of community that gay neighborhoods provide and support(Bitterman and Hess 2021).Takeawaymessage 6. Same-sex couples have shifted their residences away fromgay neighborhoods.Members of the LGBTQ+ population are shifting their residences or settling in newpatterns. Gayborhoods have consequently experienced noticeable diffusion since2000, with many LGBTQ+ couples relocating to other neighborhoods.In 2011 themedia began reporting the residential and commercial dispersion fromMontréal’s gay village to other parts of the metropolitan area (Podmore 2021).Generally, gay neighborhoods with a declining population of male couples tend1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 27Fig. 1.8 Signagewelcomes visitors to the Stanley StreetGayQuarter in Liverpool, England (SourceImage courtesy of Daniel Baldwin Hess)28 D. B. Hess and A. Bittermanto be situated in central cities, where housing values are rising, where medianincomes are rising, andwith lower homeownership rates thanother neighborhoods(Podmore 2021). Chapters throughout this volume explain how gay men and gaymale couples historically self-segregated into gay villages, however the trendsince 2000 suggests declining self-segregation in gayborhoods with more same-sex couples spread across all urban neighborhoods (Spring 2021). As gay peopleleave gay neighborhoods, the resulting demographic profile of those who remain(combined with newcomers who replace departing gays and lesbians) is less gaythan it was before (i.e., an overall smaller share of sexual minority identifyingpeople in the population and an overall higher share of non-LGBTQ+ individuals).In the United States, census data suggests that certain new gay neighborhoods—mostly in central cities (and not in suburbs)—sprouted between 2000 and 2010,but they were different in character (i.e., more demographically “average”) fromestablished gay neighborhoods (Spring 2021). Mobility data from the U.S. censussuggests that the key trend driving declining segregation in gayborhoods is anincrease in male same-sex households across other neighborhoods throughoutmetropolitan space (Spring 2021).Asmembers of theLGBTQ+community shift housing locations, evidence of othertypes of LGBTQ-friendly or inclusive neighborhoods is emerging (Bitterman2020; Spring 2021). As established gay neighborhoods deconcentrate, clustersof male same-sex couples [and other LGBTQ+ couples and individuals] emergeelsewhere, so that the original gayborhoods become less isolated and LGBTQ+individuals become more integrated. Again, the phenomenon of gay neighbor-hoods becoming slightly less gay, while other neighborhoods become slightlymore gay, becomes evident as LGBTQ+ people reconcentrate in other spacesaway from gay villages, producing a greater number of gay enclaves while theoriginal gay neighborhoods become less self-segregated.Visual assessment evidence in neighborhoods around Toronto indicate the emer-gence of enclaves of LGBTQ+ people living away from the established gayvillage (Bitterman 2021), supporting similar observations inAtlantawhere greaterintegration has shifted LGBTQ+ life to peripheral parts of the metropolitanregion (Doan and Atalay 2021). Importantly, we note, a spatial diffusion ofLGBTQ+ culture away from gayborhoods does not suggest a complete or pendingdemise of gay neighborhoods; instead, we argue that gay neighborhoods havearrived at a plateau from which continuous and dynamic re-spatializations acrossmetropolitan space (Coffin 2021) and the memorialization of gay neighborhoodsand places within them (Miller and Bitterman 2021) may occur.We draw attention in this takeaway message to our important observation that—although the preceding discussion has relied on, among other scholarship, arecent study of LGBTQ+ residence patterns using U.S. census data (Spring 2021)drawing on previous comparable studies (Gates and Ost 2004)—data collectionrelated to LGBTQ+ individuals, including their presence and activities in gayneighborhoods, is incomplete or is not collected at all. This poses challenges1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 29for elected leaders, advocates, and scholars in tracking LGBTQ+ individuals,couples, and families. Only certain entities collect data about same-sex partner-ships and LGBTQ+ individuals. Sometimes the data collected depends on thepolitical predilections of the administration in power. Frisch (2021) reports thatthe historic record of LGBTQ+ individuals through U.S. census data is troubledand incomplete and has resulted in erasure and marginalization. This disconti-nuity of information provides challenges for researchers, especially in the GlobalSouth and Middle East and in countries where homosexuality remains illegal orstigmatized and where little or no data is collected.Certain methodological challenges are also present. For example, the U.S. censusrelies on census tracts to represent neighborhoods, even though the boundariesof census tracts are arbitrary and do not reflect administrative district or otherelements of urban geography (Spring 2021). Consequently, varying physical defi-nitions of neighborhoods could lead to estimates of demographic and geographicphenomenon—including segregation patterns—that are lower or higher than therealities of characteristics in neighborhoods. These inconsistencies amount tode facto discrimination by omission, ignorance, or willful disregard and createsamong LGBTQ+ individuals an invisible and indiscernible minority hiding in theshadowsof heteronormative life (and reflected in administrative data anddatasets).We register concern with regard to these inequities, which may compound asintegration of LGBTQ+ people continues across urban neighborhoods.Takeaway message 7. Gay neighborhoods, at this point in their stage ofmaturation, have reached a plateau.By 2020, gay neighborhoods may have reached a plateau in their evolution; from thispoint in time and space, there are various trajectories into which gay neighborhoodsmay proceed in the coming years. A plateau, we caution, is an expected part ofan evolutionary process and not necessarily a signal that gay neighborhoods areextinguishing.As people seek to better understand the post-gay, post-binary world in whichwe find ourselves, there is a recognition that gayborhoods have possibly reacheda “pause point” in their evolution. From this position—a plateau or a naturalevolutionary stage—there are various trajectories which the future meaning andform of gayborhoods may follow (2020). While a simple linear model can beused to conceptualize the dissolution of gayborhoods when society has eventuallyreached full acceptance of LGBTQ+ and segregation is unneeded and unwanted,we can more realistically imagine much nuance—provided by the addition ofcomplex centrifugal and centripetal forces that entice LGBTQ+ people and otherpopulation subgroups toward or away from gayborhoods—to the model (Doanand Atalay 2021; Duberman 2018).As LGBTQ+ neighborhoods change and evolve, some current or original gaybor-hoods will be succeeded by or replaced with new LGBTQ+ urban space. Forexample, “micro-communities of LGBT residents will likely arise, constitutedperhaps from ten nearby apartments or ten nearby apartment buildings, rather than30 D. B. Hess and A. Bittermanthe size of ten city blocks, as in the past” (Hess 2019, 234). Demographic subpop-ulations under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, such as older LGBTQ+ adults (Bittermanand Hess 2016a), may settle in gay-friendly apartment complexes or resort-likeLGBTQ+ retirement centers (Hess 2019). Nuanced re-spatialization—perhapstaking forms that we cannot yet imagine—may describe future gayborhoods(Coffin 2021).From a position on this plateau, we pause to contemplate the potential futuretrajectory of LGBTQ+ urban space, and we suggest that it is unwise to fixateon the decline or death of gay neighborhoods but to instead better understandand explore emerging concentrations of LGBTQ+ residents in new formationsacross metropolitan space, especially other central city neighborhoods that havenot long been associated with a LGBTQ+ presence but may acquire one. Gayneighborhoods in cities continue to evolve and may reach “stagnation” points ona plateau: “Oxford Street has continued to decline materially and imaginativelyas the gay village within Sydney, [Australia] while Newtown and the inner westhave continued to solidify as queer neighborhoods” (Gorman-Murray and Nash2021, 256). Similarly, the gay village in Montréal has matured from an enclavefor gaymen to an inclusive space dominated by a queer presence (Podmore 2021).Similar observations have been made with regard to other cities by other authorsin this volume.Takeaway message 8. The evolution and history of gay neighborhoods isempowering to the LGBTQ+ community.While the future meaning and shape of gay neighborhoods is unclear, it is importantto reflect on the profound and formative effect gayborhoods had on gay life andLGBTQ+ culture during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Stemming from this remark-able period of cohesion and maturation, the historic importance of gay neighbor-hoods will continue to influence the afterlife of LGBTQ+urban space. In this way,gay neighborhoods will continue to reflect the struggle for recognition, equality, andcivil rights for sexual minorities for future generations.Prior to the twentieth century, a great deal of repression of gay and lesbian lifeand little acknowledgement occurred of bisexual or trans+ life. Various social andcultural forces converged in the second half of the twentieth century, andLGBTQ+neighborhoods were established and grew and became places from which pridefor sexual minorities emanated and through which the fight for equal rights forLGBTQ+ individuals was waged and has been (fragmentally) won over time (seeFig. 1.9).Now, the physical building blocks of gay neighborhoods—commercial estab-lishments (bars, restaurants, bookstores), services (community centers, healthclinics), and residences—may be removed or displaced due to various urbanforces including neighborhood change, revitalization, and gentrification andsocio-cultural influences (tastes, preferences, and attitudes) and even equal rightslegislation (Bitterman2020;Eeckhout et al. 2021;Hess 2019).However, if gaybor-hoods (or elements of gayborhoods) are at risk or indeed disappearing, then the1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 31Fig. 1.9 A mural at The Molly House in the Canal District in Manchester, England depicts gayand feminist icons (Source Image courtesy of Daniel Baldwin Hess)32 D. B. Hess and A. Bittermanneed to preserve these memory spaces becomes urgent to preserve the placesand document the memories of residents in the neighborhoods and social actionthat occurred there (Miller and Bitterman 2021) especially for future generations(Bitterman and Hess 2021). See Fig. 1.10.Fig. 1.10 The LGBT+ Archives Project of Louisiana is located just outside the French Quarter inNew Orleans (Source Image courtesy of Alex Bitterman)1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 33As we mention in takeaway message 5, gay neighborhoods can be vulnerableto erasure due to urban revitalization and gentrification (Eeckhout et al. 2021).If gay neighborhoods are becoming less gay, declining, or potentially disap-pearing, it seems that they are being reinforced and even replaced by a diasporaof LGBTQ+ cultures across time and space as other neighborhoods become moregay and LGBTQ+ inclusive. Gay neighborhoods possess a legacy and historythat has meaning beyond their current physical life; Coffin (2021) explains that“non-climactic gayborhoods leave “afterglows,” affects that continue to exertgeographic effects in the present and near future” (Coffin 2021, 373) and “agayborhood can have an afterlife even if its physical presence is lost” (Coffin2021, 381). LGBTQ+ neighborhoods can consequently be expected to continueto “exert an influence, albeit an altered one, on the sociospatial dynamics ofurban conurbations (and beyond” (Coffin 2021, 375). The physical presence ofLGBTQ+ urban space can thus be replaced by a “subconscious image” of gayneighborhoods (Coffin 2021). In this way, aspects of gayborhoods live on evenafter aspects of the physical place have been removed:This is because gayborhoods, like most meaningful places, produce intense affectiveexperiences that leave their marks in the minds and bodies of humans, as well as in theheterogeneous bodies that constitute the nonhuman environment. … If a plateau, sucha physical place that can be experienced first-hand, becomes sufficiently intense, suchas a highly concentrated gayborhood that forms the heart of local LGBTQ+ cultures,then it can leave an afterglow that continues to exert an effect through the bodies ofthose that experienced this intensity. Put differently, the plateau describes a place as aphysical-sensual environment within a particular territory, while the afterglow denotesa post-place as an imaginary-symbolic effect that percolates through deterritorializednetworks. (Coffin 2021, 381)1.7 Conclusion: Resurgence and RenaissanceThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, established gay neighborhoods became increas-ingly “less gay,” and more mainstream, while many LGBTQ+ residents moved toother neighborhoods and communities (arguablymaking these neighborhoods “moregay”), while the perception of gay neighborhoods as relevant and meaningful beganto fracture. As gay neighborhoods appear to “decline” through LGBTQ+ populationloss (Spring 2021) and in other ways (Bitterman 2020, Hess 2019), new gay districtsarise in processes of household migration and demographic shifts—spread acrossmetropolitan space—in a pattern of succession and replacement (Doan and Atalay2021; Bitterman 2021; Podmore 2021). Displaced LGBTQ+ residents often re-groupin other nearby locations—a sort of LGBTQ+ diaspora masked by mainstream inte-gration—planting the seeds for the potential genesis of future gay neighborhoods(Bitterman 2021). Gentrification, shifting generational attitudes and social values,increasing use of technology and pandemic are among the many factors that influ-ence the relevance and desirability of gay neighborhoods. Perhaps gentrification(and in some cases, hypergentrification) has run its course. In the early days of the34 D. B. Hess and A. BittermanCOVID-19 pandemic, affluent people fled cites and urban neighborhoods in favor ofgreater space and isolation from others. As the gentrifiers move out, “queerdos” havebegun to return to cities to reclaim their place (Kane 2020), resulting in new typesof neighborhood forms and dynamics. This phenomenon calls into question whetherthe plateau at which we currently find gay neighborhoods portends the beginning ofthe end of gay neighborhoods, or the beginning of a new cycle for gay neighborhoodsor simply part of the evolutionary process. Moreover, this plateau largely relates togay neighborhoods in the Global North. Perhaps gay neighborhoods of a different oralternative sort may emerge as civil rights, recognition, and tolerance shifts acrossthe Global South, evident in countries like India and the Philippines.LGBTQ+ people migrate to new districts when they find safe, inclusive, andconvenient access to everyday services and amenities—especially LGBTQ-friendlybusinesses and services—and now, perhaps more so than before 1990, the pres-ence of services that support LGBTQ+ families including schools, libraries, child-care centers, and family healthcare facilities. Gay neighborhoods appear to be atthe vanguard edge of continual evolution—embodying a type of urban diaspora ormetamorphosis—further evolving and adapting as LGTBQ+ individual and familiesre-sort themselves into new spaces (Andersson 2009). These “seed communities”—formative pockets that are too small yet to be considered proper neighborhoods—are the likely genesis points for future gay settlements that will emerge over time.TheseLGBTQ+micro-districts surface in expected places and unexpected places; theHayes Valley in San Francisco, built partly on reclaimed urban land where a freewaywas removed, is not exactly a gay neighborhood, but a gay-inclusive place populatedby and visited by people connected with the famed Castro. A similar phenomenon isoccurring in theRoncesvalles andParkdale neighborhoods ofToronto,withLGBTQ+people migrating from Toronto’s legendary Church Street gayborhoods find placesthat proudly and outwardly welcome LGBTQ+ individuals (Bitterman 2021). Thepotential reconfiguration of LGBTQ+ communities (physical communities, virtualcommunities, and other communities) is in opposition to an assumption in 2020of urban decline following the COVID-19 pandemic and the stresses—economicdecline, joblessness, a feared urban exodus, feelings of despair—it has caused (Batty2020; Florida et al. 2020).Perhaps “second generation” gay neighborhoods will serve future generationsof LGBTQ+ residents, citizens, families, and visitors by providing similar (andperhaps new, unimagined) functions just as established gay neighborhoods haveserved past generations (Bitterman and Hess 2021). While not all “seed” communi-ties will flourish and some may even be extinguished by external forces, it is likelythat as the needs of LGBTQ+ citizens and families change, so too will the types ofneighborhoods these citizens and families require as gay neighborhoods potentiallyreconfigure for the future. In this way, gay neighborhoods could reconstitute aroundthe archetype reflecting their existence for the previous five decades or in a form thatdoes not yet exist or we cannot yet imagine. Moreover, we anticipate that establishedgay neighborhoods will propagate via an “afterglow” (Coffin 2021) as historicallyrelevant sites become landmarked or memorialized (Miller and Bitterman 2021).1 Who Are the People in Your Gayborhood? … 35Gay neighborhoods have proven themselves resilient to the AIDS/HIV pandemic,economic change, population loss, demographic change, gentrification, and otherforces. Given the evidence offered by chapters in this book and the thematic takeawaymessages enumerated in this chapter, we argue that we are not witness to the “death”or even the uncontrolled decline of gay neighborhoods; instead, we suggest thatgay neighborhoods by 2020 have reached a state of maturity and have ascendedto a plateau in which a decentralized LGBTQ+ populace may provide the catalystfor new forms of community engagement, activism, and relevance. The chapters inthis volume emphasize the pressing need for supporting safe, inclusive, productiveneighborhoods for LGBTQ+ people.ReferencesAldrich R (2004) Homosexuality and the city: an historical overview.

This trendtoward a more even distribution of male same-sex couples across city neighborhoodscalls into question the demographic future of gay neighborhoods. However, it isunclear how exactly male same-sex couples are spatially reorganizing within deseg-regating cities. Multiple processes could be driving declining segregation, includingdeclining shares of same-sex households within gay neighborhoods, the emergenceof gay neighborhoods in new parts of the city, and/or a general dispersal of same-sexcouples to almost all neighborhoods. Moreover, it is unclear what characteristics—like urbanicity, housing values, or racial/ethnic composition—define neighborhoodsthat have gained (or lost) same-sex partners. This chapter uses data from the 2000 and2010 Decennial Censuses to investigate neighborhood-level changes within deseg-regating cities. The small number of increasingly segregated cities are also explored.Results indicate that increasing representation of male same-sex households acrossmost neighborhoods and an expanding number of gay neighborhoods are importantcontributors to the trend of declining segregation. In contrast, the loss of gay neigh-borhoods from a citywas fairly uncommon—most neighborhoods that obtained largeconcentrations of same-sex partners tended to keep those concentrations over time.Finally, the same residential expansion of same-sex households that occurred withindesegregating cities did not occur in cities that experienced increasing segregation.These results have important implications for the spatial organization of same-sexhouseholds into the future.

Springcensus data for the continued study of the geography and segregation of same-sexpartners.Keywords U.S. Census · Same-sex households · Gay neighborhoods · Spatialreorganization2.1 IntroductionSince 2000, Census data have allowed researchers to track the segregation of same-sex couple households from other households. Spring (2013) demonstrated that thesegregation of both male and female same-sex couples from different-sex couplesdeclined within the 100 largest cities in the United States between 2000 and 2010.Some scholars have taken this as evidence that same-sex couples are dispersingout of established “gayborhoods.” However, multiple demographic processes couldbe driving declines in segregation. For several reasons, same-sex couples might bemaking up lower shares of all households in gay neighborhoods, while retaining rela-tively static representations in other parts of the city. Or, same-sex couples might beincreasingly represented in newparts of the city, as they grow in numbers and/ormovefrom other areas. Thus, the fact alone that segregation has declined in many citiesleaves open many unanswered questions about how exactly this pattern emerged.Also important are the characteristics of changing neighborhoods. What featuresdefine neighborhoods that are losing shares of same-sex partners? Urbanicity? Highhousing costs? And what features define neighborhoods that are gaining sharesof same-sex partners? Suburban locations? Affordable housing? Racial and ethnicdiversity?To answer these questions, this chapter takes a closer look at metropolitanstatistical areas (MSAs) with declining segregation of male same-sex householdsand describes the sociodemographic characteristics of neighborhoods within theseMSAs. Using data from the 2000 and 2010 US Censuses, this chapter identifiesneighborhoods that had increasing, decreasing, or static shares of male same-sexhouseholds. Demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic characteristics of theseneighborhoods are then compared. This chapter also investigates changes in gayneighborhoods, including changes in their prevalence and spatial distribution withinMSAs. Demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic characteristics of neighbor-hoods that transitioned to or from a gay neighborhood, or remained unchanged,are also compared. Lastly, this chapter investigates the small number of MSAsthat experienced increasing segregation of male same-sex households and exploresneighborhood changes within these areas as well.Through such descriptions, a better picture of within-MSA changes in the spatialdemography of male same-sex households can emerge, providing clues into thefuture geographies of same-sex partners. At the same time, such descriptions call forus to be critical consumers of census data, as these data are not very inclusive and2 Breaking Down Segregation: Shifting Geographies … 45notoriously error-prone for same-sex partners (DiBennardo and Gates 2014). Thechapter concludes with a look ahead to the 2020 Census, and what it will mean forfuture research on the geography and segregation of same-sex partners.2.2 Data and Methods2.2.1 Decennial Census DataData come from the 2000 and 2010 US Decennial Census Summary File 1, the100% census count of the US population (US Census Bureau 2000, 2010). Censustracts boundaries are used to approximate neighborhoods. Data are standardizedto geographic boundaries from the year 2000 (Geolytics Inc. 2010) to account forany shifts in census tract boundaries over the study time period. Male same-sexpartners are identified in the census data by combining individual responses to twoquestions: the sex of each individual living in the household and their relationshipto the household head. Two males who report an “unmarried partner” relationshipare defined as male same-sex partners. “Unmarried partner” is defined by the censusas a person who was not related to the householder but who had a “close personalrelationship”with them. TheCensusBureau recoded responses of “same-sex spouse”to “unmarried partner” over the study time period.There are several limitations to this census-based definition of same-sex partners.First, the Census did not ask sexual orientation directly, so it can only be inferred forindividuals living with unmarried partners of the same sex. This means the censusdata do not represent the entire LGBTQ population. Second, some same-sex partnersmay have been unwilling to identify themselves on the Census. Census follow-upstudies have assessed the undercount of same-sex partners and have estimated that16–19% of same-sex partners did not identify themselves in Census 2000 (Badgettand Rogers 2003), and 10% of same-sex partners did not identify themselves in 2010(Gates 2010). Third, there were substantial errors in the 2010 Census that resultedin a significant number of different-sex partners being counted as same-sex partners(O’Connell and Feliz 2011). The Census Bureau re-estimated the number of same-sex partners using micro-data level files of respondents’ first names and an indexof the sex commonly associated with their first names (see O’Connell and Feliz2011 for a detailed description of the methodology). Revised counts for 2000 and2010 were released by the Census Bureau at the state level. Using the procedureoutlined by Gates and Cooke (2012), I then apply the state error rates to individualcensus tracts to calculate revised tract estimates. The revised census tract estimatesare used throughout this analysis including in the calculation of segregation scores.Fourth, the present analysis relies on census tracts to represent neighborhoods, eventhough the boundaries of census tracts are somewhat arbitrary.Different definitions ofneighborhoods could lead to segregation estimates that are higher or lower, especiallyif these definitions differ dramatically from census tract boundaries.46 A. Spring2.2.2 Segregation ScoresThis study categorizesMSAs as those that experienced declining or increasing segre-gation of male same-sex partners from different-sex partners (including married andunmarried partners) between 2000 and 2010. I measure segregation with the index ofdissimilarity. The index of dissimilarity compares two groups at a time, and valuesrepresent the percentage (ranging from 0 to 100) of one group needing to changeresidences (in this case, move into a census tract where they are underrepresented)in order to achieve an even distribution (Duncan and Duncan 1955).The index of dissimilarity is statistically independent of the relative size of the twogroups used in its computation, which is particularly important in this study becausedifferent-sex partners greatly outnumber same-sex partners in all MSAs. However,the index can be sensitive if the population of one group is small compared to thenumber of census tracts used in its calculation (Johnson and Farley 1985). To ensurethere is a substantial number of male same-sex partners for analysis, this study islimited to the 100 most populous MSAs.1 Segregation indices cannot be reliablycalculated for smaller MSAs.2.2.3 Gay NeighborhoodsThis study relies on a demographic definition of gay neighborhoods. To determinewhether a census tract is a gay neighborhood, the tract percent of male same-sexhouseholds out of all households is compared to a threshold for the metropolitanarea. The threshold adopted for this analysis is at or above the 90th percentile forpercentmale same-sex households in theMSA in the year 2000.2 Tracts are comparedto the 2000 threshold in 2000 and 2010, to determine whether tracts were a gayneighborhood in 2000 andwhether tracts transitioned into or out of gay neighborhoodstatus by 2010. This threshold is somewhat arbitrary and could just as easily be setat a lower or higher percentile. The 90th percentile is used because it generates alarge enough number of gay neighborhoods to calculate summary statistics, withoutbeing overly inclusive. This purely demographic definition does not encompass thefull identity and broader symbolic meaning of gay neighborhoods; for that I directreaders to other excellent chapters in this volume.1I conducted sub-analyses comparing the 50 most populous MSAs to the next 50 most populousMSAs, and found similar distributions of segregation scores across these groups of MSAs.2If a slightly lower (or higher) percentile is chosen, then slightly more (or less) neighborhoods areclassified as gay neighborhoods. Despite shifts in the number of gay neighborhoods, the contextualchanges within gay neighborhoods observed in Table 2.5 and the differences in shares of gayneighborhoods across desegregating and increasingly-segregated cities observed in Table 2.6 remainsubstantively similar at slightly lower or higher thresholds for gay neighborhoods.2 Breaking Down Segregation: Shifting Geographies … 472.2.4 Other Neighborhood CharacteristicsData on other census tract characteristics are drawn from the 2000 and 2010 USDecennial Census (US Census Bureau 2000, 2010) and the 2005–2009 AmericanCommunity Survey (USCensus Bureau 2009) and are also standardized to year 2000geographies. Of particular interest to this study is the urbanicity of neighborhoods.I define “urban” neighborhoods as those that are inside the principal city(ies) oftheir metropolitan area.3 Neighborhoods outside of a principal city are defined as“suburban.” Other tract variables includemedian home values, share of housing unitsthat are owner-occupied, total population, share of households with own childrenunder 18, share of the population age 25+ with a college degree, median income, andracial-ethnic distributions. All monetary variables are specified in year 2010 dollars,and any comparisons made to the year 2000 are adjusted for inflation.2.2.5 AnalysisI first summarize segregation scores in 2000 and 2010, dividing the sample of MSAsinto those that experienced declining segregation of male same-sex households andthose that experienced increasing segregation. I then take a descriptive look at theneighborhoods within each of those MSA contexts. I describe the share of tractswithin each group of MSAs that experienced declining, increasing, or static sharesof male same-sex partners out of all tract households, and the share of neighbor-hoods that transitioned to or from a gay neighborhood. Then, within each of thoseneighborhood categories, I summarize the sociodemographic characteristics of thoseneighborhoods.2.3 Results2.3.1 Trends in Segregation and Neighborhood ChangeThe dominant pattern in US metropolitan areas is declining segregation of malesame-sex households. Among the 100 largest MSAs in the United States, 96 experi-enced declining levels of segregation between 2000 and 2010 and only 4 experiencedincreasing levels of segregation. Table 2.1 shows the average index of dissimilarityacross these MSAs. In desegregating MSAs, the index of dissimilarity was 61.73 in2000 and 52.10 in 2010, a decline of 9.63 points. In increasingly segregated MSAs,3The largest city in each MSA is designated a “principal city.” Additional cities qualify as principalcities if they meet specific requirements for population size and employment (US Census Bureau2019a). The list of principal cities of metropolitan areas according to Census 2000 definitions wasobtained from the US Census Bureau (1999).48 A.

What is notable about these numbers is that desegregating MSAs started outat higher levels of segregation than did MSAs where segregation increased. In fact,both groups of MSAs end up at similar levels of segregation, with segregation scoresthat are in the low 50s. According to guidelines fromMassey and Denton (1993), theoverall average index of 52.18 is considered in the “moderate” range for segregation.The levels of segregation reported in Table 2.1 are higher than segregation scoresreported in Spring (2013), primarily because Spring (2013) based that assessmenton individual cities (i.e., census-designated places), while the data here are forMSAs. This suggests that the inclusion of the surrounding suburban areas of MSAscontributes to higher segregation scores for male–male households. The differinggeographies of male same-sex households in urban versus suburban areas is animportant point I return to throughout the chapter.Because declining segregation is far and away the dominant trend and only fourMSAs actually experienced increasing segregation, I now turn to more in-depthassessment of desegregating MSAs. Within the context of a desegregating MSA,how have individual neighborhoods changed?Table 2.2 reports changes in neighborhood shares of male same-sex householdsout of all households.Within the context of desegregation, tracts on average increasedtheir shares of male–male households, going from an average of 0.18% male–malehouseholds in 2000 to 0.26%male–male households in 2010.Although these percent-ages are still quite small (they are both less than one percent), the trend that is drivingdeclining segregation appears to be increasing representation of male same-sexhouseholds across most neighborhoods. Indeed, Table 2.2 also shows that more thanhalf of all tracts (57.79%) within the 96 desegregating MSAs had increasing sharesof male–male households. By comparison, 27.93% of tracts experienced decliningshares of male–male households, and 14.27% experienced no change.Another way to assess neighborhood-level change in desegregating MSAs is tocompare demographic changes in gay neighborhoods. Table 2.3 shows how manyneighborhoods met the demographic threshold for a gay neighborhood in 2000 and2010. By definition, about 10% (9.89%) of neighborhoodswere defined as gay neigh-borhoods in 2000 (since the definition is based onmeeting the 90th percentile for tract2 Breaking Down Segregation: Shifting Geographies … 49Table 2.2 Change in tractshares of male–malehouseholds withindesegregating MSAsDesegregating MSAsTract share of male–male households,20000.18%Tract share of male–male households,20100.26%Share of tracts with declining shares ofmale–male households27.93%Share of tracts with increasing shares ofmale–male households57.79%Share of tracts with static shares ofmale–male households14.27%N tracts 39,185N MSAs 96Table 2.3 Transitions of gayneighborhoods withindesegregating MSAs*Desegregating MSAsShare of gay neighborhoods, 2000 9.89%Share of gay neighborhoods, 2010 16.51%Share of tracts by whether gayneighborhood in 2000, 2010Not gay nh (2000), not gay nh(2010)80.30%Not gay nh (2000), gay nh (2010) 9.80%Gay nh (2000), not gay nh (2010) 3.19%Gay nh (2000), gay nh (2010) 6.71%N tracts 39,185N MSAs 96*Gay neighborhoods are defined in each year as tracts that are ator above the 90th percentile for tract share of male–male partnersin the MSA in the year 2000share of male same-sex households in theMSA in 2000). By 2010, 16.51% of neigh-borhoods were defined as gay neighborhoods, suggesting that an expanding numberof gay neighborhoods is another important contributor to declining segregation.Despite this expansion, most neighborhoods (80.30%) were not gay neighbor-hoods in 2000or 2010.However, a fairly substantial number of neighborhoods (9.8%)transitioned to gay neighborhood status by 2010. Of the remaining neighborhoods,3.19% transitioned out of being a gay neighborhood, while 6.71% were gay neigh-borhoods in both time periods. Overall the data in Table 2.3 somewhat challengethe idea that gay neighborhoods are declining or withering away. A small minorityof gay neighborhoods did transition away from having substantial shares of male50 A. Springsame-sex households. But more common was that gay neighborhoods remained gayneighborhoods, and that new gay neighborhoods emerged.2.3.2 Characteristics of Neighborhoods WithinDesegregating CitiesThe previous section demonstrated the divergent pathways of neighborhoods withindesegregating cities. While many neighborhoods have expanded their shares ofmale same-sex households, a few have gone in the other direction, and manyothers have remained unchanged. What are the sociodemographic characteristicsof neighborhoods following each of these trends?Table 2.4 focuses on urbanicity, housing, and other demographic characteristicsof tracts within desegregating MSAs, depending on whether the tracts experienceddeclining, increasing, or static shares ofmale same-sex households. Data are reportedfor 2010. The level and direction of change from 2000 is also reported.Among tracts with declining shares of male same-sex households, the averageshare ofmale–male households out of all householdswas 0.16% in2010, representinga 0.16 percentage point decline from the year 2000. Thismeans that in neighborhoodsthat lost shares of male same-sex partners, shares of male–male partners were onaverage cut in half.About half (50.55%)of these neighborhoodswere located in urbanareas and another half were located in suburban areas (49.45%). Since about 45%of tracts in the sample of MSAs were in urban areas, neighborhoods that lost sharesof male–male households were somewhat overrepresented in urban areas. Theseneighborhoods also represent areas where housing values have grown (+$40,842),median incomes have grown (+$931), and homeownership rates were lower than inother neighborhoods (54.30%).Neighborhoods with increasing shares of male same-sex households seem to haveabsorbed about the same percentage of male–male households that were lost fromdeclining neighborhoods. These neighborhoods nearly doubled their shares of malesame-sex households from 2000 to 2010, and by 2010 had the greatest shares of malesame-sex households compared to other neighborhoods. These neighborhoods wereabout equally distributed between urban and suburban areas. They too had increasinghome values (+$40,121) and were otherwise fairly similar to neighborhoods withdeclining shares of male same-sex partners. These neighborhoods may have offereda few more opportunities for homeownership and had slightly higher rates of collegedegrees and higher median incomes. These neighborhoods also appeared to be lessdiverse than neighborhoods with declining shares of male same-sex partners. Theformer were 61.32% white, while the latter were 53.30% white.Finally, Table 2.4 reveals that neighborhoods with static shares of male same-sexpartners were static because they had nomale–male households in either time period.These tracts were overwhelmingly suburban (77.35%). These tracts also had greaterincreases in home values (+$65,004) than other neighborhoods, and much higher2 Breaking Down Segregation: Shifting Geographies … 51Table 2.4 Characteristics of tracts within desegregating MSAs, by direction of change in the shareof male–male householdsTracts with decliningshares of male–malehouseholdsTracts with increasingshares of male–malehouseholdsTracts with staticshares of male–malehouseholdsMean \u0002 from2000Mean \u0002 from2000Mean \u0002 from2000Tract Characteristics, 2010Share of male–male households%Male–malehouseholds0.16 −0.16 0.38 +0.16 0.00 0.00Urbanicity% Urban 50.55 – 47.97 – 22.65 –% Suburban 49.45 – 52.03 – 77.35 –HousingMedian homevalue ($)267,783 +40,842 268,588 +40,121 266,531 +65,004%Owner-occupiedhomes54.30 −0.50 56.71 −0.75 72.37 −1.35DemographicsTotal population 4614.06 +1055.23 4880.49 +1255.83 5088.11 +605.91% Householdswith children21.54 −1.41 20.72 −2.04 26.64 −11.08% College degrees 27.21 +1.30 30.42 +0.99 31.37 +3.07Median income ($) 55,123 +931 57,914 +276 71,156 −2,627% White,non-Latinx53.30 −0.13 61.32 +0.24 74.94 −4.64% Black,non-Latinx21.21 +0.29 16.35 +0.04 9.05 +0.62% Asian,non-Latinx5.29 +1.44 4.77 +0.88 4.19 +0.93% Latinx, any race 16.92 +2.19 13.70 +1.56 7.87 +1.81% Other race 6.87 +5.77 6.99 +5.49 6.91 +4.09N tracts 10,946 22,646 5,593rates of homeownership (72.37%), more households with children (26.64%), highermedian incomes ($71,156), and were more white (74.94%).

It is also possible to select a slightlyhigher or lower percentile. In that case, while the number of neighborhoods within each category ofgay neighborhood transitions shifts, the relative changes in tract characteristics over time within thesecategories remains similar2 Breaking Down Segregation: Shifting Geographies … 53a gay neighborhood, remained a gay neighborhood, or transitioned one way orthe other. Those that were gay neighborhoods in 2000 and remained gay neigh-borhoods in 2010 had the highest shares of male same-sex households (1.35%)compared to all other neighborhoods. These neighborhoods were very likely to beurban neighborhoods (88.32% urban) and were substantially underrepresented inthe suburbs (11.68% suburban). These neighborhoods also had the highest and mostrapidly increasing home values ($345,420; up $101,483 since 2000), along with thelowest rates of homeownership (42.12%), compared to all other neighborhoods. It isimportant to note that despite high housing costs, these neighborhoods remained gayneighborhoods and even increased their shares of male same-sex households. Theseneighborhoods also had low rates of households with children (13.44%), high ratesof college degrees (44.85%), some of the highest incomes ($57,860), and were notespecially diverse (61.01% white, non-Latinx).The least common neighborhood was one that transitioned from a gay neigh-borhood in 2000 to a non-gay neighborhood in 2010. In these neighborhoods, theaverage tract share of male same-sex households was 0.20% in 2010, down 0.45percentage points from 2000. These were mostly urban neighborhoods (70.54%),but also some suburban (29.46%). These neighborhoods, on average, had lowerhousing values than other neighborhoods ($244,482), the lowest rates of collegedegrees (25.13%), and the lowest median incomes ($46,028), suggesting that theseneighborhoods were perhaps struggling socioeconomically. These neighborhoodswere also the most racially diverse neighborhoods, with higher than average sharesof Black and Latinx residents (27.09 and 21.13%, respectively).Some neighborhoods became gay neighborhoods over the time period. Theseneighborhoods saw the highest increases in shares of male same-sex households(+0.46 percentage points), compared to other neighborhoods. These neighborhoodswere 67.98%urban and 32.02% suburban.When it comes to housing values and otherdemographic characteristics, these neighborhoods tended to be neither the highest norlowest compared to the other neighborhoods. These neighborhoods weremoderate interms of homevalues, rates of homeownership, incomes, and other sociodemographiccharacteristics. This seems to suggest that new gay neighborhoods did represent adeparture from those that were already gay neighborhoods in 2000, in that newgay neighborhoods were more “average” types of neighborhoods (average, that is,demographically).Not surprisingly, those that were never gay neighborhoods had the lowest sharesof male same-sex households (0.13%), compared to all other neighborhoods. Theseneighborhoods were more often in the suburbs (62.34%), but a substantial sharewere also urban (37.66%). These neighborhoods had the highest rates of homeown-ership (61.34%), the highest rates of households with children (23.19%), the highestmedian incomes ($60,600), and the lowest levels of racial diversity (62.15% white),compared to all other neighborhoods. Much like the tracts with zero shares of malesame-sex partners described in Table 2.4, these typically well-off, mostly suburbanneighborhoods have remained relatively closed-off to male same-sex households.54 A. Spring2.3.3 Increasingly Segregated CitiesAs previously shown, the dominant trend among MSAs is declining segregation ofmale same-sex partners. However, among the 100 most populous MSAs, 4 MSAsexperienced increasing segregation. These were Los-Angeles-Long Beach-SantaAna, CA; Stockton, CA;Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL; and Augusta-Richmond County, GA-SC. This section takes a brief look at neighborhood changeswithin these increasingly segregated metropolitan areas.Although only 4MSAs experienced increasing segregation, theseMSAs includedover 4,000 census tracts. Table 2.6 assesseswhether the distribution ofmale same-sexhouseholds across these 4,000+ tracts differed from the average distribution in deseg-regating MSAs. The data indicate that tracts in increasingly segregated MSAs had,on average, greater shares of male–male households than in desegregating MSAs inboth 2000 and 2010. More of the neighborhoods in increasingly segregated MSAshad declining shares of male–male households than in desegregating MSAs (5.65%more),while fewer neighborhoods had increasing shares (1.51% fewer). These differ-ences are fairly modest, but may indicate that in increasingly segregated MSAs therewas a trend of male same-sex households leaving a large number of neighborhoodsto settle (or resettle) in a smaller number of neighborhoods. In other words, while thetrend in desegregating MSAs was toward neighborhood “deconcentration” of malesame-sex partners, the trend in increasingly segregated MSAs seems to be moretoward (re)concentration.The change in gay neighborhoods in increasingly segregatedMSAs follows alongthe same lines. In 2000, desegregating and increasingly segregatedMSAs had similarnumbers of gay neighborhoods. But by 2010, increasingly segregated MSAs hadfewer gay neighborhoods than desegregating MSAs. This is primarily because moreneighborhoods in increasingly segregated cities (2.64% more) remained ‘not gay’ in2000 and 2010.Because this is a summary of only four metropolitan areas, and the MSAs them-selves are very different in terms of geography and socioeconomic conditions, readersare cautioned against reading too much into the data in Table 2.6. Further statisticalsummary of these four MSAs likely would not carry much meaning (which is why Ido not present that here), but further research on increasingly segregated cities couldfollow several important directions. First, it might be interesting to assess what thesecities have in common with cities that only slightly declined in segregation. Theline that separates these types of cities might be very small, and perhaps these citiesas a group are quite distinct from cities that are more rapidly desegregating. Suchcomparisons could be useful for identifying the metropolitan-level conditions thatsupport more rapid, as opposed to more minimal, changes in segregation, since thedominant trend is toward decline anyway. Second, this statistical work should becomplemented by qualitative descriptions of cities with varying contexts of segrega-tion. The four MSAs identified as increasingly segregated might provide interestingand important counterpoints to qualitative research in desegregating cities.2 Breaking Down Segregation: Shifting Geographies … 55Table 2.6 Neighborhood change within increasingly segregated MSAs*Increasingly segregated MSAs Difference from desegregatingMSAsTract share of male–malehouseholds, 20000.24% +0.06Tract share of male–malehouseholds, 20100.35% +0.09Share of tracts with decliningshares of male–malehouseholds33.57% +5.64Share of tracts with increasingshares of male–malehouseholds56.28% −1.51Share of tracts with staticshares of male–malehouseholds;10.15% −4.12Share of gay neighborhoods,2000*9.96% +0.07Share of gay neighborhoods,2010*14.51% −2.00Share of tracts by whether gayneighborhood in 2000, 2010*Not gay nh (2000), not gay nh(2010)82.94% +2.64Not gay nh (2000), gay nh(2010)7.10% −2.70Gay nh (2000), not gay nh(2010)2.55% −0.64Gay nh (2000), gay nh (2010) 7.41% +0.70N tracts 4,197N MSAs 4*Gay neighborhoods are defined in each year as tracts that are at or above the 90th percentile fortract share of male–male partners in the MSA in the year 2000.

In that case, while the share of gay neighborhoods changes withinMSAs,the relative difference in the share of gay neighborhoods between desegregating and increasinglysegregating MSAs remains similar2.4 The Demographic Future of Gay NeighborhoodsWhat do the aforementioned results mean for the demographic future of gay neigh-borhoods?Contrary to somepopular assumptions, gay neighborhoods are not ceasingto exist. However, gay neighborhoods are demographically changing and spatiallyreorganizing, even within the broader context of declining segregation. Underlyingdeclining rates of segregation seems to be the increasing suburbanization of malesame-sex households and gay neighborhoods.56 A. SpringAt the same time, some suburban areas (and some urban areas, to a lesser extent)have remained closed-off to male same-sex households. These tend to be econom-ically vibrant, “child-friendly,” mostly suburban neighborhoods. It will be inter-esting to see if these neighborhoods remain unchanged in the 2020 census. It isprobably unlikely that these neighborhoods will remain isolated from the dominanttrend of increasing male same-sex populations at the neighborhood-level. However,quantitative and qualitative researchers may find it interesting to track how theseneighborhoods change, and how same-sex households fare when they enter theseneighborhoods.2.5 Future Research: Census 2020 and BeyondFuture research on the segregation of same-sex partners depends on the availabilityof high-quality data. The census is a federal product mandated by the constitution,and is arguably the most important and consequential source of data on the USpopulation. One could argue that the accuracy with which the census counts LGBTQpopulations says a lot about society. If the United States wants to strive for equalitybased on gender identity and sexual orientation, it must also strive for accuracy innational data collection efforts. Accurate estimates matter for both practical reasons(e.g., the allocation of funding for community resources) and symbolic reasons (e.g.,the visibility of marginalized communities), which is why there is so much at stakefor getting the estimates right.Due to inaccuracies with Census 2010, Census 2020 moved to a newway to countsame-sex partners. In 2000 and 2010, same-sex partnerships were inferred by cross-referencing the sex of each person and their relationship to the household head. Thismethod was prone to error, because as it was later revealed, a significant number ofindividuals mis-marked their sex and were erroneously counted as same-sex partners(O’Connell and Feliz 2011). The new method asked directly within the relation-ship question whether each person was an “Opposite-sex husband/wife/spouse,” an“Opposite-sex unmarried partner,” a “Same-sex husband/wife/spouse,” or a “Same-sex unmarried partner” (US Census Bureau 2019b). This reframing of the questionshould considerably improve the accuracy of same-sex partner population countsand is a huge step in the right direction.What Census 2020 still lacked was a separate LGBTQ category. Detailed ques-tions that ask directly about sexual orientation and gender identitywould finally allowsingle LGBTQ people to be counted. The US Census Bureau reportedly proposedsuch questions in the lead-up to the 2020 Census (Wang 2018). However, those ques-tions were quickly removed from consideration by the federal administration shortlyafter Trump took office in 2017. In 2018, the “Census EqualityAct”was introduced inthe US Senate, which, if it becomes law, would require sexual orientation and genderidentity questions to be added to the census by 2030 and the American CommunitySurvey by 2020 (Govtrack 2019). According to the bill’s sponsor Senator Kamala2 Breaking Down Segregation: Shifting Geographies … 57Harris, “the spirit of the census is that no one should go uncounted and no one shouldbe invisible” (Govtrack 2019).To obtain accurate data, the Census Bureau not only needs to ask the right ques-tions, it also need to overcome peoples’ concerns about participation.Misinformationabout the census, concerns over confidentiality of responses, and general distrust inthe government all serve as barriers to participation. A number of advocacy organiza-tions are seeking to break through those barriers, encouraging LGBTQ populationsto “get out the count” and “queer the census” (National LGBTQ Task Force 2019).Yet even with 100% participation, the census can still only provide a simplistic,point-in-time snapshot of LGBTQ populations. LGBTQ identities can be complex,in flux, and individualized (Browne 2010); and as such, there will always be somemisrepresentation when the only option is to check a box.Despite its limitations, theUSCensus remains a critical source of data on same-sexhouseholds. Other useful sources of data include large scale social surveys like theGeneral Social Survey4 and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to AdultHealth5—which have continued to fold more LGBTQ people into their samples,and smaller targeted studies like the Williams Institute’s mixed-methods Pathwaysto Justice study6—which focus specifically on LGBTQ people. Such expansion ofqualitative and quantitative data on LGBTQ people will be instrumental in furtheringour understanding of LGBTQ lives. But the Census remains the only data sourcelarge enough in scale to track the geographic segregation of same-sex householdsover time. For scholars interested in how the spatial reorganization of LGBTQ popu-lations impacts LGBTQ communities, such demographic estimates of segregationand change are important for setting the broader context. The need for such researchfurther underscores the need for a non-political, accurate, and inclusive nationalcensus.ReferencesBadgett ML, Rogers MA (2003) Left out of the count: missing same-sex couples in census 2000.Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies (IGLSS), Amherst, MABrowneK (2010) Queer quantification or queer(y)ing quantification: creating lesbian, gay, bisexual,or heterosexual citizens through governmental social research.

Planning for these neighborhoodsrequires data about LGBTQ residential concentration. Some analysts have used USCensus same-sex partner data to make judgments about LGBTQ neighborhoods.Two agency actions make this reliance problematic. The US Census was requiredto enforce the Defense of Marriage Act and reassigned some LGBTQ responses ina heteronormal way. The Census also assigned sex based upon patterns of names.These US Census actions of gay removal and sex assignment to datasets raise ques-tions about the usefulness of the partner dataset. A queer reading of the censusmay give a better representation of neighborhood development and decline. Data aredeveloped for four queer neighborhoods: the West Village in New York City, CenterCity Philadelphia, Midtown Atlanta, and Midtown Kansas City. The results showthat queer attributes of these areas grew to about 1990. Some queer attributes mayhave declined some from their peak. The results raise questions about social surveys,the closet, and the direction of LBGTQ neighborhoods in the twenty-first century.LGBTQ displacement has occurred.Keywords LGBTQ neighborhoods · US Census · Planning · Queer past ·Marriage · Sex ratios · Gentrification · Displacement3.1 IntroductionThe mainstreaming of lesbian and gay culture through the adoption of same-gendermarriage may be changing the nature of lesbian and gay enclaves (Ghaziani 2014).Stories in the press (James 2017) note this changing nature of gay neighborhoodsas bars, clubs and bookstores that cater primarily to a gay and lesbian clienteleclose. These closings are evidence of neighborhood change and displacement. Urbanplanners usually use Census data to measure neighborhood change. Yet the Census,M.

Frischeven in 2020, does not explicitly ask about sexual orientation or gender identity. ThisChapter develops an alternative way of looking at LGBTQ neighborhood changeusing Census data. This allows for the development of a baseline to allow furtherassessment of LGBTQ neighborhood changes. The resulting analysis gives somecontext to the generational rise and relative decline of the gayborhood.Measuring US neighborhood change relies heavily on Census data in the UnitedStates. Since the 1940Census, urban areas of theUnited States have been divided intocensus tracts (Snow 2011). For the last 80 years, urban scholars analyzed changesin population and housing within neighborhoods to the degree that census questionsand definitions defined variables of interest. These variables include age, sex, race,marital status, housing characteristics, household composition, andwork status.Witheach Census, definitions of variables would be modified to reflect necessary changesin proposed outcomes and to reflect changes in social conceptions of subgroupingin work and residential life (Alonso and Starr 1987). The lack of Census questionson LGBTQ variables such as gender and sexual orientation has meant that analysesof LGBTQ neighborhoods and places rely on a combination of other informationsources to determine their location and degree of concentration (Forsyth 2011). Earlyanalyses of gay neighborhoods relied on ethnographic stories of LGBTQ commu-nity members building neighborhood institutions (Castells 1983). Other methods foranalysis included identifying concentrations of LGBTQ institutions and organiza-tions such as bars, businesses and non-profits who were willing to list themselves inLGBTQ guides (Harry 1974; Levine 1979; Wolfe 1992). Historical work has had torely on a combination of oral history and archival material (Chauncey 1995).Withouta national gay rights law, LGBTQ people risk their own livelihoods by being out andcounted as part of a community. Such readings of history have had to rely on theability to read code—implicit expressions of queerness identifiable between the lines(Sedgwick 1990). Throughout most of the twentieth century, the ethics of compul-sory heterosexuality and the closet meant that much evidence of variance may havebeen destroyed to protect reputations (Rich 1993). Thus, it was an exciting advancein urban studies in the late 1990s when the Census began to put together a series oftables on same-sex partnered households (Black et al. 2000). These data might allowa more accurate accounting of residential LGBTQ neighborhoods.Researchers used this dataset. Most famously, Richard Florida’s Creative Class(2002) theory relied on the Census Bureau’s concentration of same-sex partneredhouseholds as a measure of regional tolerance (Florida and Gates 2003). At the sametime that the Creative Class theory was gaining respectability, the Census Bureauwas involved in a process of reassigning lesbian and gay partnered responses asheterosexual responses when constructing these data sets (Simmons and O’Connell2003). The reassigning of responses is gay removal. Evidence about changes ingay neighborhoods based solely on this dataset must account for changes in how theCensus Bureau constructs the dataset (MRFHS 2014).While 25 years of Census dataon same-sex partnered households exists, the 2020 Census does not ask the questionsabout sexual orientation and gender necessary to develop a fuller understanding ofLGBTQ communities and neighborhoods (Doan 2016; FIWG 2016b; Edgar et al.2018; Wang 2018).3 A Queer Reading of the United States Census 63The answer to this lack of data is to do a queer reading of the census. This requiresreading the structured silences within Census data (see Frisch 2002). Census dataand government survey data has been structured around questions of citizenship,representation, and distribution (Alonso and Starr 1987). These structures reflectheteronormative ideals of marriage, households and the nuclear family. Therefore,a queer reading of the Census asks—how would a queer person answer the Censusquestions?Howandwhere doesmy household and the households of LGBTQ friendsand acquaintances show up in the data categories collected? Asking these questionsraises issues about intersectionality, the closet, gender expression, passing, and whatit means to live in and around LGBTQ communities. Such a reading allows foridentifying clusters of LGBTQ individuals and positions LGBTQ neighborhoods incontrast to the question of non-heteronormative neighborhoods.This analysis starts with a quick review of heteronormality and its social enforce-ment by urban development processes and planning. Census questions and theresulting data, must be considered within this context. The next section presentsthe problems of Census data on LGBTQ communities. The most accurate way ofassessing LGBTQ neighborhoods would be to add questions about sexual orientationand gender identity. The earliest we might get an accurate census count of LGBTQcommunities is 2030.Without these data, the queer reading of theCensus proceeds byasking, “how might a person with a non-heteronormative life answer the Census?”Indicators such as sex ratio, and marital status may then identify neighborhoodsoutside heteronormative expectations. The analysis proceeds by illustrating how aqueer reading of the Census might work with examples of four probable “queer”neighborhoods—Midtown in Kansas City; Midtown in Atlanta; the West Village inNew York City and Center City Philadelphia. Such a reading provides evidence ofa decline in queerness—indicating areas of possible displacement by the end of thestudy period. This chapter concludes that full recognition in the public realm requirescounting.3.2 Heteronormativity and Urban DevelopmentWhile different sexual orientations and gender identities have been around forever,themeanings attached to the categories are products of themodern era (D’Emilio andFreedman 2012). Homosexuality and heterosexuality are terms coined by sexologistsof the late nineteenth century and only really attained their modern meanings aroundthe turn of the century. Heterosexuality as a term arose to encompass often unspokenassumptions about normal society. Katz (1995) identifies three basic componentsof heteronormality: that marriage can only be between one man and one woman,that a nuclear family of heterosexual parents is the expected and best site for raisingchildren, and that it is the only site where expression of romantic and sexual pleasureshould be allowed. These assumptions about heteronormality still surround us everyday—who comprises an average family?What gets shownonTV, andwhat is suitablefor kids to see?64 M. FrischFrisch (2002) argues that modern methods of urban planning arose at the sametime as these categories of sexual orientation identity. Urban planning acts to buildand promote heterosexual spaces and places on purpose. The rise of suburbs madeof single-family houses is a part of this heterosexist project as apartment buildingsare seen to threaten sexual and gender norms. The development of LGBTQ neigh-borhoods post-Stonewall must be viewed within the context of systematic powerexpressed through societal pressure and physical environments favoring heteronor-mality as well as the direct powerful legal forms of discrimination. These threatslessened as more people came-out and joined social movements demanding theirrights. Some see the LGBTQ rights movement as one of the most successfultwentieth-century movements for social change (Sullivan 2005; Lakey 2018).Coming out, a successful organizing tactic of LGBTQ politics, is an act of perfor-mance (Butler 1993). When LGBTQ folks choose to be out and publicly expressgender and sexual identity, they act against these cultural norms. LGBTQ rights havebeen achieved because of the millions of people choosing to contradict the assump-tions of heteronormality. Yet, the “closet” functions as a “double bind” (Halperin1995). It is a strategy to protect yourself from the physical violence of hate crimes,and from discrimination at your job. In this sense it gives you agency. It is also thestrategy of received and perceived oppression that restricts what you do (Sedgwick1990). The closeted safe choice is to stay silent. As Foucault (1978) notes, thesesilences have patterns. Finding these structures of individual responses to political,social, and cultural oppression then requires both an understanding of possible incon-sistencies in response, aswell as a view of howheterosexuality is empowered throughlegal and extralegal means. Even same-sex marriage may be seen through this lens.A same-sex marriage of course overturns the hierarchy of sex roles within marriage.Two lesbians together raising kids disorients the assumptions of heterosexuality inthat masculine and feminine roles in parenting may be performed by someone of thesame gender. The arguments for religious freedom in regard to LGBTQ folk are allabout defending the primacy and natural existence of different sex roles (AllianceDefending Freedom 2019). These cases however hover around the discovery that apossible client, customer or patient is LGBTQ. Informationmanagement stillmatters.The normalization of LGBTQ status then requires tolerance, recognition, andeventually acceptance of LGBTQ status. Tolerance might be seen through the earlystages of LGBTQ enclave formation (see Forsyth 2011). Recognition requires someacceptance of standing as a citizen as evidenced by the Supreme Court rulings inthe Lawrence v. Texas (2003), US v. Windsor (2013) and the Obergefell v. Hodges(2015) decisions. Increasing acceptancemay then lead to amore dispersed residentialpattern (Ghaziani 2014). Without LGBTQ places then do we still need LGBTQspaces (Nusser and Anacker 2013, 2015)? If gay neighborhoods are in decline, dowe then need to take action to protect and plan for LGBTQ space? Planning forLGBTQ neighborhoods and communities requires information about individualsand households comprising the community. In theUnited States, the Census providesinitial local data that informs planning analysis.3 A Queer Reading of the United States Census 653.3 The Census, Heteronormativity, and LGBTQPopulationsUS Census questions change every decade to reflect changing notions of Amer-ican citizenship (Anderson 2015). Furthermore, the Bureau of the Census runs andcoordinates other social surveys such as the Current Population Survey in order tocollect information necessary for further implementation of government policies andprograms (Alonso and Starr 1987). The 1990 Census added questions about unmar-ried partners in households (Simmons and O’Connell 2003), however, as the datawas being collected, the assumption was being made that unmarried couples hadto be of a different sex. Responses that were from people in same-sex partnershipshad their responses changed by the Bureau to being a response of a different sex.This was during a health crisis when accurate data about gay men would have savedlives—yet the Census Bureau was actively removing lesbians and gays responsesfrom the Census. With the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, theseacts of gay removal became the policy of the Bureau. A technical note from 2003stated:Same-sex spouse responses were flagged as invalid to comply with the 1996 Federal Defenseof Marriage Act (H.R. 3396) passed by the 104th Congress. This act instructs all federalagencies only to recognize opposite-sex marriages for the purposes of enacting any agencyprograms. In order for Census Bureau data to be consistent with this act and the data require-ments of other federal agencies, same-sex spouse responses were invalidated. The legislationdefines marriage and spouse as follows:… interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, …the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or wife.—Simmons and O’Connell (2003)This policy interfered with how same-sex partner datasets could be developed. If thepartner answering the Census question used the word “spouse” it must be invalid.The Census Bureau was acting as an enforcer of heteronormality. This decisionof course had an impact on the datasets used by Florida and Gates in developingtheir tolerance index (2003). In the 2000 census, if someone listed their partner aspartner they were counted as being in a same-sex unmarried couple. If they saidthey had a spouse—their response was reclassified as “straight.” The tolerance indexthen measured the degree that LGBTQ folks in same-sex partnerships used the term“partner” in answering the census.Howmuch did this process of gay removal impact the same-sex partner database?Later work on the 2010 Census data revealed the degree of gay removal and sexclassification errors in the Census data. Using “uncorrected data” from the full-count, same-sex partnered households who used the term “partner” accounted for0.32% of all households in the year 2000 and 0.47% of households in the 2010 census(O’Connell and Feliz 2011: 5). Same-sex households that used the word “spouse” todescribe their partnership accounted for 0.24% of all households in 2000 and 0.30in 2010. According to counts produced by Census procedures “spouse” householdsaccounted for 43% of these households in 2000 and 41% of households in 2010.66 M. FrischYet, Gates and Steinberger’s (2009) work found that only 16% of unmarried partnerswould answer the census describing their partner as spouse. It turns out that theover count of “spousal” responses in the Census was due to a Census procedureaccounting for non-respondents to the Census. The Census uses the probability thata particular name aligns with a particular sex to assign a sex classification to peoplein non-respondent households (O’Connell and Feliz 2011). Errors due to this sex-assigning name processing led to a 28% over count of same-sex partners in 2010(O’Connell and Feliz 2011: 23). This sex assignment procedure may also produce a“misgendering.”The 2010 Census occurred at a moment when the Defense of Marriage Act wasstill the Federal law, and only Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, NewHampshire and DC had legalized same-sex marriage. More than half the states hadsome sort of state law or constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. The 2010 Censusdefinition of the family maintained that a family required one or more people livingin the same housing unit who are related to the householder by “blood, marriage,and/or adoption.” These criteria have been consistent for 80 years (Pemberton 2015).In the 2010 Censusmany same-sex partnered couples with kids were only consideredto be a family due to their having kids whereas an opposite-sex couple who wasmarried without kids would be considered a family. Once again, heteronormality isthe underlying deciding factor in how the datasets are put together between familiesand households.Federal agencies reacted to the problems with organizing data around same-sexpartners and unmarried couples and the challenges that increasing recognition ofsame-sex partnered relationships made to heteronormal assumptions about marriageand families. In 2010, during the Obama administration, the Office of ManagementandBudget organized the InteragencyWorkingGroup onMeasuringRelationships inFederal Household Surveys to examine issues related to collecting information abouthousehold formation. After reviewing 55 surveys done by various Federal agencies,this task force found a series of measurement issues that could lead to inconsistentresults:1. variation in response categories (for example, more categories and/or differentcategory wording);2. inconsistent measurement of relationship to child;3. infrequent measurement of interrelationship of all household members;4. inconsistent measurement of cohabitation;5. infrequent measurement of sex for all household members; and6. inconsistent inclusion of State of current residence and State where married—(MRFHS 2014: ii).The task group also suggest various ways to improve data gathering:First, question wording should incorporate sex-neutral language wherever possible;Second, Federal surveys should continue working to collect information on intimaterelationships other than opposite-sex marriage:3 A Queer Reading of the United States Census 67Third, Federal agencies should review their current use of editing and processing procedureswith respect to sex, relationship, and marital status;Finally, results from tests and discussions should be widely shared, not only among Federalagencies but also with other interested parties such as academic and policy researchorganizations.—MRFHS (2014: iii)The task group also remarked that the United States v. Windsor (2013) caseoverturning the Defense of Marriage Act would have an impact on how survey dataare processed (MRFHS 2014: 3). The work of this task group then set the stage forpotentially asking about sexual orientation and gender identity in the 2020 Census.While reporting on questions for theCensus and theCurrent Population Survey one ofthese research groups found no “significant issues that would make collecting SOGI(sexual orientation and gender identity) information in the CPS infeasible” (Edgaret al. 2018: 4).Draft lists of questions for the 2020Census including sexual orientationwere initially proposed in 2018 only to be censored by Trump administration officials(Wang 2018). Only recently have Federal agencies begun the work of understandingthe implications of asking questions about gender identity (FIWG 2016a; Holzberget al. 2018).Table 3.1 sorts out the various national estimates of the number of same-sex part-nered households in the United States within the context of all partnered householdswhether married or not. Over the last two decades the number of same-sex partneredhouseholds has more than doubled going from 0.6% of households in 2000 to 1.33%in 2019. Perhaps this is evidence of a rise in homonormativity (Bell and Binnie2004). At the same time, we still do not have population-based numbers for sexualorientation and gender identity. We do not know how many un-partnered peopleconsider themselves LGBTQ. We do not know how transgender and/or genderqueerfolks would answer the “sex”-based questions on the survey; and we do not knowhow many opposite-sex partnered households are made up of LGBTQ folks livingin what looks like a heteronormative household in census terms. Sadly, we must nowwait until 2030 to get population-wide results.3.4 A Queer Reading of the CensusThe previous discussion showed why the distribution of the partnered data may ormay not estimate the relative degree of concentration of LGBTQ folks in a partic-ular neighborhood. Looking back over time can we find variables where residentsanswer Census questions in patterns that show that they are not living in a typicalheteronormal fashion? While Census questions were written with the presumptionof heteronormativity, what if we look for queer patterns instead? When faced with aCensus questionnaire, howmight have a queer person have answered it? For example,gay partners inNewYorkCity often kept their separate apartments. Spacewas alwaysrunning short in New York and if you had access to a rent-stabilized apartment you68 M.

While some housing protec-tions for LGBTQNewYorkers have existed since the early 1990s, same-sexmarriagemakes it easier to guarantee security. In Kansas City, with more LGBTQ repression,queer men and women may have been in opposite-gender marriages in the past.Single LGBTQ folks may have lived in a relatively closeted situation within theirkinship networks in one space and lived out their LGBTQ lives by going out anddating in other spaces and places. Howwill these situations show up in neighborhoodcensus data? A queer reading of the census chooses multiple variables that mightreflect these situations.A concentration of LGBTQ folks would then show up as a concentration of peoplewithout the characteristics of heteronormality. From 1960 to 2000 this would meanpeople of child-rearing age who are not involved in what was counted as marriageat the time—only opposite sex people with a marriage license from the state. Gener-ally, people between the ages of 25 and 54 who are single and/or divorced are notconforming to the societal norm of marriage and procreation during their child-rearing years. TheCensus has been reportingmarital status of people age 15 and older3 A Queer Reading of the United States Census 69and this variable includes counts of single and divorced people by sex. LGBTQneigh-borhoods will therefore have concentrations of these people. With heteronormality,there would be a relative evenness in the sex ratio—the ratio of men to women withinthe same age cohort.As lesbian andgay social connections develop betweenmembersof the same-sex, a lesbian neighborhood may show a higher number of women thanmen while a gay male neighborhood will have the opposite ratio showing highernumbers of men than women. It is important to note that other socio-spatial forcesand institutions may create sex ratio imbalances. For example, mass incarcerationleads to minority neighborhoods with a higher proportion of women. Local mili-tary bases may lead to neighborhoods with higher proportions of men. Furthermore,the census definition of family also reinforces heteronormality by requiring ties byblood and/or marriage. LGBTQ neighborhoods then will have higher proportions ofnon-family households.3.5 Testing the Variables in Four NeighborhoodsThe three variables: the proportion of non-family households, marital status, and sexratio by age cohort were analyzed for four neighborhoods in four different cities:the West Village in New York City, Center City in Philadelphia, Midtown Atlanta,and Midtown Kansas City. Maps detailing the Census Tracts (US Census Bureau2020) encompassing the study areas are shown in Fig. 3.1 for New York, Fig. 3.2for Philadelphia, Fig. 3.3 for Atlanta, and Fig. 3.4 for Kansas City. All of theseneighborhoods were chosen because they housed LGBTQ bars in the early 1990s aslisted in the Damron guide (Damron Co. 1993, see Knopp and Brown 2020 for ananalysis of the impact of these guides). The West Village is the site of the StonewallRiots in 1969. Center City Philadelphia includes both Washington Square that JaneJacobs (1961) called a “pervert park” aswell as Rittenhouse Square andCamac Streetthat were notorious as gay meeting places. Midtown Atlanta was chosen to give anidea of how these variables might work within the South. Midtown in Kansas Citywas chosen in order to capture places where there was a concentration of bars in thepast as well as an effort to develop a lesbian community in the 1970s and early 1980s.All of these areas have also faced development and gentrification pressures since atleast 1980. With these geographies selected, the question becomes, will the selectedvariables show the expected concentrations over time? This would be the period from1960 to 2000 which captures the emergence of the LGBTQ social movements. Thesecond question then becomes, if the variables work as a measure, might changes inthese variables reveal increasing and decreasing levels of concentration? This secondquestion gets at the issue of gentrification and displacement. LGBTQ displacementwould lead to lower levels of these variables appearing sometime in the years 1990–2015.70 M.

At the national level, the percent of non-family householdshas increased in every period. Kansas City, Philadelphia and New York all had threetimes the number of non-family households in 1960, while Atlanta had more thantwice the level of non-family households. By 1970 all four neighborhoods weremade up of a majority of non-family households and by the year 2000, seven outof ten households were non-family households in these four areas. Yet, note thatthe percent of non-family households in the West Village declines in the 1980s andthe percent increase in Midtown Kansas City and the West Village lag behind thenational change from 1980 to the year 2000.MidtownAtlanta had the highest overallgrowth in this variable, while Center City, Philadelphia had the least growth of thefour neighborhoods, yet Center City and the West Village started at a significantlyhigher level.3.7 Never Married by Sex ResultsThe percent of men and women who have never married (single people) is shown inTables 3.3a, b. These results show that there is a difference by sex. Interestingly, thereis a relatively consistent higher percent (5–7%) of men who have never married than3 A Queer Reading of the United States Census 75Table 3.3a Share of men, age 15 and over never married by neighborhood 1960–2000US Atlanta Midtown Kansas CityMidtownPhiladelphiaCenter CityNew York CityWest Village1960* 27.18 33.28 26.25 39.24 41.381970 28.11 37.26 34.41 43.96 47.931980 29.58 53.69 47.67 51.15 61.391990 29.91 60.36 54.19 57.68 60.542000 31.28 61.65 54.85 58.18 62.332010 ACS 35.08 58.71 57.64 57.72 58.392015 ACS 36.29 55.72 60.73 54.27 63.7660–70 change 0.93 3.98 8.16 4.72 6.5370–80 change 1.47 16.43 13.26 7.19 13.4680–90 change 0.33 6.67 6.52 6.53 −0.8590–00 change 1.37 1.29 0.66 0.50 1.7900–10 change 3.80 −2.94 2.79 −0.46 −3.9410–15 change 1.19 −2.99 3.09 −3.45 5.32*Note 1960 percentages calculated with men age 14 and overSource Social Explorer (2019a, b)Table 3.3b Share of women age 15 and over never married by neighborhood 1960–2000US Atlanta Midtown Kansas CityMidtownPhiladelphiaCenter CityNew York City WestVillage1960* 21.61 30.31 26.82 32.35 39.791970 22.08 26.96 30.28 39.23 44.361980 22.49 35.99 37.47 44.70 50.311990 22.75 41.97 42.09 49.22 51.302000 25.09 49.00 46.28 48.22 54.292010 ACS 28.74 46.48 50.77 53.46 57.492015 ACS 30.09 47.58 52.07 52.42 56.1460–70 change 0.47 −3.34 3.46 6.88 4.5770–80 change 0.41 9.03 7.19 5.47 5.9580–90 change 0.26 5.98 4.62 4.52 0.9990–00 change 2.34 7.03 4.19 −1.00 2.9900–10 change 3.65 −2.52 3.49 5.24 3.2010–15 change 1.35 1.10 1.30 −1.04 −1.35*Note 1960 percentages calculated with women age 14 and overSource Social Explorer (2019a, b)76 M. Frischwomen over the almost sixty-year period for the United States. Midtown KansasCity had a lower percentage of men never married than the US average in 1960,but had the highest total growth in net percentage over the time period (See Table3.3a). By 1990 all four neighborhoods had 25% more male singles than the nationalaverage. Midtown Atlanta and Midtown Kansas City had much more growth in thisfactor than Center City and the West Village; but all four neighborhoods had muchhigher growth than the US overall (Table 3.3a). All four neighborhoods had higherlevels of single women than the US at the start of the study period. The West Villagestarted much higher than the other neighborhoods in 1960 and Midtown KansasCity had slightly more single women than single men (Table 3.3b). The net percentgrowth for single men surpasses the percentage for women for the US and all fourneighborhoods for the period, with the neighborhoods having a much higher netdifference. Center City Philadelphia single women total percentage growth comesclosest to the male percentage growth. By the year 2000, single women make uparound 50% of all women in the four neighborhoods. Finally, there was a decline inthe percent of men who were single in the West Village in the 1980s and a declinein the percent of women who were single in Center City, Philadelphia in the 1990s.Apart from Kansas City, the other neighborhoods decline in numbers of single menfrom 2000 to 2010. More recently this decline continues in Midtown Atlanta andCenter City Philadelphia up to 2015.3.8 Divorced by Sex ResultsThe percent of women and men over the age of 15 who listed their marital statusas divorced are shown below in Tables 3.3c, d. In this question, the Census privi-leges being married; no matter if it is the second, third, or fourth marriage. All fourneighborhoods have higher levels of divorced men in 1960 than the United States asa whole and the levels increase in all four neighborhoods to 1980. After 1980, thepercent of divorced men drops in all four neighborhoods even though the percent isrising in the United States. By the year 2000, the level in Center City is less thanthe US average as shown in Table 3.3c. The percent of divorced men and women inthese neighborhoods is higher in Midtown Atlanta and Midtown Kansas City thanit is in Center City Philadelphia or the West Village. If you add the percent of menin the four neighborhoods who are either divorced or single, it accounts for 66%of all men in the four neighborhoods by the years 1990 and 2000. The totals forwomen are generally less, running between 55 and 63%. The net percent growth indivorced men and women lagged behind the growth in the nation for three of the fourneighborhoods with Kansas City being the exception. Note that men have a higherrate of never marrying, but women have a higher rate of being divorced as shownin Tables 3.3a–d. By 2010 all four neighborhoods lag in the net growth of divorcedmen and women compared to the nation.3 A Queer Reading of the United States Census 77Table 3.3c Share of men age 15 and older, divorced, by neighborhood, 1960–2000US Atlanta Midtown Kansas CityMidtownPhiladelphiaCenter CityNew York CityWest Village1960* 1.83 4.78 6.43 4.28 3.381970 2.22 8.28 10.22 5.66 6.131980 4.80 12.54 15.61 8.01 9.441990 6.83 10.78 15.40 7.47 8.882000 8.31 9.95 13.47 6.85 7.522010 ACS 9.46 8.79 12.65 5.63 7.292015 ACS 9.52 7.90 11.14 6.33 5.0960–70 change 0.39 3.50 3.21 1.38 2.7570–80 change 2.60 4.26 5.39 2.35 3.3180–90 change 2.03 −1.76 −0.20 −0.54 −0.5690–00 change 1.48 −0.83 −1.93 −0.62 −1.3600–10 change 1.15 −1.16 −0.82 −1.22 −0.2310–15 change 0.06 −0.89 −1.52 0.70 −2.20*Note 1960 percentages calculated with men age 14 and overSource Social Explorer (2019a, b)Table 3.3d Share of women age 15 and older, divorced, by neighborhood, 1960–2000US Atlanta Midtown Kansas CityMidtownPhiladelphiaCenter CityNew York City WestVillage1960* 2.64 7.88 8.47 3.70 6.031970 3.49 10.44 11.94 5.46 7.691980 6.64 13.88 15.53 8.81 11.881990 8.86 14.19 16.11 9.28 11.912000 10.22 12.90 15.50 9.72 9.652010 ACS 11.99 11.11 14.79 8.72 9.772015 ACS 12.12 12.19 12.54 8.98 8.3960–70 change 0.85 2.56 3.47 1.76 1.6670–80 change 3.15 3.44 3.59 3.35 3.1980–90 change 2.22 0.31 0.58 0.47 0.0390–00 change 1.36 −1.29 −0.61 0.44 −2.2600–10 change 1.77 −1.79 −0.71 −1.00 0.0810–15 change 0.13 1.08 −2.25 0.28 −1.36*Note 1960 percentages calculated with women age 14 and overSource Social Explorer (2019a, b)78 M. Frisch3.9 Sex Ratio of Age 25–54 Cohort ResultsThe sex ratio measures the number of men in the age cohort relative to the number ofwomen. Within a heteronormative model this ratio should be close to one as childrenare always assumed to have a married mother and father living together. A sex ratioof greater than one indicates more men than women in that geography and a sex ratioless than one indicates more women than men. The results for the neighborhoodsare shown in Table 3.4a. First, note that the US ratio has gone from 0.96 to 1.01from 1960 to 2000. In 1960, Midtown Atlanta and Midtown Kansas City had morewomen than men while Center City and the West Village were about average. Theratio rises to hit the peak in 1980 in Midtown Atlanta, Center City and the WestVillage and 1990 in Midtown Kansas City. The ratio increases are quite sharp forMidtown Atlanta and Midtown Kansas City and much more balanced in CenterCity and the West Village. Both Center City and the West Village had significantlesbian and gay male communities in 1960; did these communities concentrate inparticular census tracts within these neighborhoods? Variation of sex ratios withineach neighborhood’s individual tracts is shown in Table 3.4b. This analysis shows amuch, much higher concentration in specific census tracts in the West Village andCenter City in 1960. The highest ratios were in Center City and the West Village in1960. The patterns of highs and lows were different in each place. Midtown Atlantastarted as a woman dominated area in 1960, and only with 1970 did a tract havesignificantly more men. By the peak of sex ratio difference in 1980, all MidtownAtlanta tracts had more men than women, a pattern that continues to a lesser extentTable 3.4a Sex ratio of age 25–54 cohort by neighborhood compared to US 1960–2000US Atlanta Midtown Kansas CityMidtownPhiladelphiaCenter CityNew York CityWest Village1960 0.96 0.80 0.84 0.98 0.941970 0.96 1.10 0.97 1.07 1.061980 0.98 1.47 1.26 1.08 1.261990 0.99 1.46 1.34 1.09 1.172000 1.01 1.27 1.17 1.07 1.012010 0.99 1.40 1.32 1.09 1.022015 ACS 1.00 1.19 1.22 0.94 1.1860–70 change 0.00 0.30 0.13 0.09 0.1270–80 change 0.02 0.37 0.29 0.01 0.1080–90 change 0.01 −0.01 0.08 0.01 −0.0990–00 change 0.02 −0.19 −0.17 −0.02 −0.1600–10 change −0.02 0.23 0.15 0.02 0.0110–15 change 0.01 −0.21 −0.10 −0.15 0.16Source Social Explorer (2019a, b)3 A Queer Reading of the United States Census 79Table 3.4b Sex ratio of age 25–54 cohort variation extremes across neighborhood census tractsAtlantaMidtownKansas CityMidtownPhiladelphiaCenter CityNew York City West Village1960 high 0.92 0.96 5.67 3.171960 low 0.71 0.67 0.78 0.691970 high 1.41 1.28 3.80 1.851970 low 0.86 0.78 0.74 0.751980 high 2.57 1.53 1.82 2.021980 low 1.12 0.95 0.75 1.001990 high 2.03 1.65 2.04 1.561990 low 1.08 1.06 0.74 1.022000 high 1.62 1.42 1.53 1.172000 low 1.06 1.00 0.94 0.972010 high 1.92 1.68 2.52 1.122010 low 1.04 0.98 0.89 0.962015 ACS high 1.93 2.09 1.43 1.252015 ACS low 0.80 0.94 0.66 1.07Source Social Explorer (2019a, b)to this day (Table 3.4b). In Midtown Kansas City, a tract had the highest numberof women per men in 1960 of all four neighborhoods. The peak in the tract-basedsex ratio difference was in 1990 in Kansas City, In Center City Philadelphia, therehave been both male-dominated tracts and female dominated tracts consistently overthe study period. While the Center City sex ratio difference dropped from 1960 to1980, it rose again by 1990, dropped by 2000 and rose by 2010. Finally, the WestVillage had one of the greatest differences in sex ratio in 1960 only to drop to theleast difference after the year 2000.3.10 DiscussionThesemeasures capture relatedways of examining the concentration of folks possiblyleading LGBTQ lives in neighborhoods thought to be LGBTQ friendly in the last 55years. Each of the tables shows how queer lives in the neighborhoods substantiallydiffered from the United States. The direction of the indicators toward concentrationin these factors creates evidence of the rise of LGBTQ community formationwith thebaby-boomer generation forming what we now know as gayborhoods. The neigh-borhoods trend together up until 1990 or 2000 and then the trends on the studiedfactors become more variable across the four neighborhoods. The nuances in thedata trends are also interesting. Midtown Kansas City and Midtown Atlanta bothhad higher proportions of divorced men than Center City Philadelphia and the West80 M. FrischVillage in New York. This possibly reflects stronger enforcement of “compulsoryheterosexuality” in the urban South and the urban Midwest than on the East Coastespecially in the 1970s and 1980s.The reduction in concentration post 1980 may reflect a reduction in the valueof proximity. However, the specificity also smacks of displacement. The 1980s and1990s were the HIV plague years for gaymenwith hundreds of deaths in these neigh-borhoods. Sarah Schulman (2013) calls the losses of this time “the gentrification ofthe mind.” AIDS deaths significantly altered the gender make up of these neighbor-hoods. Each of the neighborhoods had significant new developments that displacedLGBTQ institutions. Starting in the mid-1980s, Midtown Atlanta along Peachtreewas transformed from a low-rise district to a mid-rise and high-rise district (Doanand Higgins 2011). After 1990, Midtown Kansas City replaced a neighborhoodwith gay bars and clubs with Midtown Marketplace housing a Home Depot and aCostco. Center City Philadelphia created the University of the Arts south of CityHall replacing LGBTQ bars. Finally, the West Village underwent multiple transfor-mations as the West Side Highway was transformed into a boulevard and the piersbecame parks. New residential developments and luxury lofts replaced artist studiosand LGBTQ clubs. LGBTQ folks get displaced by these gentrification processes.The peaks in non-family households in these neighborhoods around 1990 may alsoreflect the lesbian and gay baby boom beginning with lesbian couples in the 1990sand gay male couples after the year 2000 (Gates 2013; Gurrentz and Valerio 2019).These households would reduce the number of non-family households, while havinga lesser impact on the sex ratio.3.11 Comparison to Same-Sex Unmarried Partner DataThe changes in the non-family household variable raises the question about howsame-sex partnered households are currently counted in the American CommunitySurvey (ACS). Table 3.1 shows that by 2019 a majority of same-sex partnered house-holds weremarried in the latest Current Population Survey data. How does the flawedsame-sex unmarried partner data in 2000, corrected ACS data for 2010 (2008–20125 Year data) and corrected ACS data for 2015 (2013–2017 5 Year data) compareto the results of these measures? The same-sex partner data confirm that there arerelatively high concentrations of same-sex partners in these four neighborhoods asshown in Table 3.5. The concentration is three to ten times more in these neighbor-hoods than the overall rate for the nation as a whole. These households still make upa small fraction of the households in these neighborhoods. Yet, the queer reading ofthe census analysis showed that these neighborhoods have a majority of householdsthat reject heteronormality in one form or another.3 A Queer Reading of the United States Census 81Table 3.5 Unmarried same-sex partners as a share of all households in the four neighborhoodsUS AtlantaMidtownKansas CityMidtownPhiladelphiaCenter CityNew York CityWest Village2000 0.56 4.54 2.17 1.84 4.032010 ACS 0.25 3.32 2.00 1.72 2.772015 ACS 0.36 2.36 1.96 1.42 3.41Source 2000 Census, 2008–2012 ACS, 2013–2017 ACS as downloaded from Social Explorer(2019a, b)3.12 ConclusionThis analysis took the first step toward a queer reading of the census. Exploratoryfactor analysismight be used to deepen the analysis by uncovering other variables thatcapture the rise of LGBTQ communities. Such an analysis may be able to distinguishunderlying factors that also lead to changes in levels of the selected variables such asthe sex ratio. For example, during the period analyzed in this study,mass incarcerationremoved a significant generation of minority men from their neighborhoods. Thisremoval would show up in terms of low sex ratios for these neighborhoods. Othervariables could be used. The rate of detached single-family homes may be a markerfor heteronormality as fixed by the Euclid V. Ambler decision (Frisch 2002). Smartand Klein’s (2013) findings suggest mass transit use might also be an indicator.Even at their peak, LGBTQ neighborhoods were really just enclaves (seeMarcuse1997). There were always other folk in these neighborhoods. This analysis shows anincrease in concentration and then a flattening out and/or decline in the measures.The declines in concentrations show evidence of queer displacement.With increased social acceptance, along with increased legal rights due to threepositive Supreme Court cases: Lawrence V. Texas (2003), US v.Windsor (2013), andObergefell v. Hodges (2015), LGBTQ folk might not need their own neighborhoodsand enclaves to the same degree as in the past (Kelly et al. 2014). IntersectionalLGBTQ communities may not use space and place in the same ways as stereotypicalwhite gay men (Irazábal and Huerta 2016). Worry about social acceptance for sexualorientation and gender identity may now play less of a role in choosing a place to live(Ghaziani 2014).QueerMillennialsmaynot seek the samequalities in neighborhoodsas LGBTQ Boomers. After the 2016 election, there is evidence of backlash (Miller2019). This backlash has been accompanied by the rise of anti-LGBTQ spaces—health providers, pharmacists, wedding cake bakers, and florists who claim thattheir religious beliefs are being violated by equally serving LGBTQ folks (Melling2018; Green 2019a, b). The “violation” arises in opposition to someone who istruthful, public, and out about their LGBTQ identity which results in further LGBTQdisplacement.While these methods will be necessary to assess LGBTQ neighborhoods in thepast, it is unsettling that sexual orientation and gender identity questions will not beon the 2020 Census. This omission reveals that the Census will still treat gender as82 M. Frisch“sex.” This failure means the “queer reading of the Census” will still be necessaryinto the next decade. Good answers to these questions will be hard to get as longas people can be fired for their answers. Getting the data is a significant part ofrecognition. It also would provide key data that can be used to develop services andinclusive urban plans (Forsyth 2011). The lack of asking the questions, reinforces thenotion that speaking about sexual orientation and gender identity is somehow offen-sive. It indirectly provides support to business establishments and service providerswhosediscriminatory actions towardLGBTQpeople are being increasingly protected(Green 2019b). Full recognition in government services and social surveys would bean important step toward establishing and protecting LGBTQ rights.ReferencesAlliance Defending Freedom (2019) Website.

Existing research in this emerging field of “gayborhood studies”emphasizes macro-structural explanatory variables, including the economy (e.g.,land values, urban governance, growth machine politics, affordability, and gentri-fication), culture (e.g., public opinions, societal acceptance, and assimilation), andtechnology (e.g., geo-coded mobile apps, online dating services). In this chapter, Iuse the residential logics of queer people—why they in their own words say thatthey live in a gay district—to show how gayborhoods acquire their significance onthe streets. By shifting the analytic gaze from abstract concepts to interactions andembodied perceptions on the ground—a “street empirics” as I call it—I challengethe claim that gayborhoods as an urban form are outmoded or obsolete. More gener-ally, my findings caution against adopting an exclusively supra-individual approachin urban studies. The reasons that residents provide for why their neighborhoodsappeal to them showcase the analytic power of the streets for understanding whatplaces mean and why they matter.Keywords Urban sexualities · Technology · Gay neighborhoods · LGBTQ+ safespaces4.1 Introduction: Gayborhood StudiesThe association between sexuality and the city is as established experientially as it isaffirmed in the academy—from sexological counts of sexual practices to thick ethno-graphic descriptions of the moral regions of urban sexual worlds (Kinsey et al. 1948;Park 1915; Park and Burgess 1925; Thomas 1907). Although the spatial expressionsof queerness are a relatively recent object of inquiry, I see foundational works inanthropology (Newton 1993; Rubin 1998; Weston 1995), Black queer studies (NeroA. Ghaziani (B)Amin Ghaziani University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canadae-mail: amin.ghaziani@ubc.ca© The Author(s) 2021A. Bitterman and D. B.

Ghaziani2005), economics (Black et al. 2002), feminist studies (Rupp 2009; Wolfe 1979),geography (Brown 2014; Hubbard 2012; Nash and Gorman-Murray 2014), history(Aldrich 2004; Chauncey 1994; Heap 2003; Kennedy and Davis 1993), sociology(Castells 1983; Laumann et al. 2004), and urban studies (Delany 1999; Fischer 1975)as part of a distinct field of “gayborhood studies” (Ghaziani 2014b, 2015b, 2019c).Research in this area focuses on the properties of urban gay districts, including theirspatial, historical, prototypical, institutional, and comparative features.1 Today, newworks are published at too rapid a rate for me to capture in just one citation (e.g.,Baldor 2018; Bitterman 2020; Callander et al. 2020; Forstie 2019; Stone 2018).The field of gayborhood studies consists of four major streams. One area ofresearch focuses on the origins and ontology of these districts (Compton and Baumle2012). Scholars ask why gayborhoods first formed (Castells and Murphy 1982;Knopp 1997; Lewis 2013), how they have changed over time (Kanai and Kenttamaa-Squires 2015; Rushbrook 2002; Stryker and Van Buskirk 1996), their cultural signif-icance for queer people (Doan and Higgins 2011; Greene 2014; Orne 2017), whythey appeal to heterosexuals (Brodyn and Ghaziani 2018; Ghaziani 2019d), and theirdiverse spatial expressions (Brown-Saracino 2018; Ghaziani 2019a;Whittemore andSmart 2016). Regardless of whether they ask about origins, change, resonance, inter-group dynamics, or spatial variability, scholars who work in this area generallypropose macro-structural arguments. For example, standard scholarly accounts pointto economic forces, especially gentrification, to explain why gayborhoods form andchange (Christafore and Leguizamon 2018; Collins 2004; Ruting 2008). Culturalistsrespond by arguing that gayborhoods are “a spatial response to a historically specificform of oppression” (Lauria and Knopp 1985: 152). When the nature of oppressionchanges, so too should the spatial response (Andersson 2019; Ghaziani 2014b). Asmall but vibrant area in this first group asks how a post-gay turn (Ghaziani 2011)affects these districts (Forbes andUeno 2019; Forstie 2018; Ghaziani 2015a; Hartless2018).A second research stream investigates the organizational profile of gayborhoods.In earlier studies, scholars argued that the institutional elaboration of queer commu-nities made them quasi-ethnic in character and composition (Epstein 1987; Murray1979). This prompted follow-up questions about whether gay districts resembleethnic ghettos (Levine 1979; Wirth 1928) and if gay bars are better conceptual-ized as private (Weightman 1980) or closet-like spaces (Brown 2000). From here,researchers documented the growth of public LGBTQ organizations (Armstrong2002), pride parades (Bruce 2016), and the globalization of queer spaces (Martel2018). Similar to the first stream, those who work in the second also favor analyticapproaches that are abstracted from the streets, including debates about shifting polit-ical logics, theories of field formation, and the interplay between global templatesand local variations of urban sexualities.1There is a separate body of work on rural and suburban sexualities (e.g., Bell and Valentine 1995;Brekhus 2003; Fellows 1996; Forsyth 1997; Gray 2009; Kazyak 2012). We can debate whether tosubsume these ideas under gayborhood studies. Although they sometimes have unique theoreticaldebates, many scholars also offer an anti-urban challenge to queer metronormativity (Halberstam2005; Herring 2010). Gayborhood studies would be incomplete without these critiques.4 Why Gayborhoods Matter: The Street Empirics … 89A third stream focuses on the effects of technology.Geo-codedmobile apps enablesame-sex sexual partner selection to occur with greater ease outside the context ofany one neighborhood. Location-based digital apps facilitate sexual transactions, andusers can construct networks of intimacy across the city (Race 2015) according totheir tastes (Clay 2018) and personal preferences—but researchers find that theseso-called “preferences” are also coded forms of sexual racism (Callander et al. 2016;Han and Choi 2018; Robinson 2015). A common argument is that geo-aware appli-cations like Grindr decenter placemaking efforts (Collins andDrinkwater 2017; Roth2016). One study of seventeen cities found that in every single one, “the virtual gaycommunity was larger than the offline physical community” (Rosser et al. 2008:588). Other researchers use the spatial concentration of men who have sex withother men, and their online activities, to track the spread of HIV and other sexuallytransmitted infections (Card et al. 2018; Salway et al. 2019). These findings have trig-gered debates about the uneven effects of technology (Blackwell et al. 2015). Someresearchers show that people use technology creatively to imagine new spaces awayfrom the gayborhood (Wu and Ward 2017), while others argue that apps reproduceinequalities (Conner 2018).Rather than origins, organizations, and technology, researchers who work ina fourth stream of gayborhood studies document demographic changes (Morales2018; Spring 2013) and consider their effects on community-building and place-making efforts (Brown-Saracino 2011; Casey 2004; Ghaziani and Stillwagon 2018;Renninger 2019). A topic of particular concern is the fate of gay bars. In San Fran-cisco, Mattson (2015) shows that the popularity of gay bars among straight peoplehas nearlywiped them out; their numbers dropped from thirteen to three in just elevenyears. The decline in San Francisco is part of an international pattern. From 2006 to2016, the number of LGBTQ bars, pubs, and nightclubs in London, UK plummetedby 58%, falling from 125 venues to fifty-three (Campkin and Marshall 2017). Thisprompted the mayor to appoint a “night czar” to oversee the capital’s £26.3 billionnighttime economy (Ghaziani 2019b). In the United States, the number of gay barlistings in the Damron Guide fell by 36.6% (Mattson 2019). Researchers have docu-mented similar “structural declines” in France, Denmark, Sweden, Amsterdam, NewZealand, Canada, and Australia (Rosser et al. 2008: 590). Most recently, scholarshave identified the emergence of temporary spaces, called “pop-ups,” as a creativeresponse to bar closures. Pop-ups are ephemeral, yet they provide enduring experi-ences of community and self-exploration (Bailey 2013; Moore 2016; Stillwagon andGhaziani 2019).Table 4.1 reviews the four streams of research in gayborhood studies, focusing onrepresentative questions, major debates, and observational units. All adopt a macro,structural, or otherwise supra-individual lens of analysis and explanation.Although scholars have produced considerable knowledge about gayborhoods, akey oversight remains: what does the gayborhood mean for the people who actu-ally live in it? Neighborhoods are a “basic building block” of cities (Forsyth 2001:343), but people relate to them and form attachments to them based on what they90 A.

By debating macro structural forces like gentrifi-cation, assimilation, technology, and demography, researchers who work in gaybor-hood studies elide matters of meaning, interactions, impressions, and interpretations.Whether a person finds the gayborhood significant—why it matters to them—is not afunction of its statistical properties. A gayborhood is a collection of sentient people.To understand what it means, we need to ask people why they are drawn to it.4.2 Why Do You Live in the Gayborhood?I draw on more than six hundred national media reports about the gayborhood acrossseveral decades of coverage, particularly stories in which a journalist interviewed4 Why Gayborhoods Matter: The Street Empirics … 91local residents, to identify six major reasons why queer people say they live in agay district and what about it appeals to them.2 Non-residential stakeholders make“vicarious” claims on gayborhoods as well (Greene 2014), but these are preciselywhat the concept of vicariousness suggests: proxy experiences that take the placeof, or are imagined as related to, the ones of residents. The patterns of association,interactional styles, and perceptions among the people who actually live in a place,like the gayborhood, provide more valid access to its local knowledges (Geertz1983) and meanings. I use the empirical expressions that residents offer to reflecttheoretically on how urban sexualities acquire their significance on the streets—orwhat I call a “street empirics.”Voting Blocs and Elections. Former San Francisco supervisor Harry Brittfamously asserted that sexuality and space are inextricably linked: “When gays arespatially isolated, they are not gay, because they are invisible” (Castells 1983: 138).Gayborhood residents echo Britt’s intuition by focusing on the political effects ofclustering. One San Franciscan said, “Having a specific neighborhood that politicianscan point to, can go to and shake hands or kiss lesbian babies, has really solidified thegay vote, our political muscle.”3 By organizing themselves into an identifiable votingbloc, LGBTQ people can exert electoral influence. A story from the New York Timesthat covered theCongressional election ofNancyPelosi noted, “The electionTuesdayis being watched as a test of the cohesiveness and political strength of homosexuals.”Voter turnout showed that queer people helped to seat Pelosi, who had “campaignedfrequently in homosexual neighborhoods.” Her campaign manager concluded, “Itappears that homosexual voters contributed to her victory.” Pelosi received 20% ofthe vote in the Castro district.4Former president Bill Clinton used a similar strategy. A story in the New YorkTimesobserved, “Voter-registration tables line gayneighborhoods. In discos, betweenvideos of Madonna and the Pet Shop Boys, images flash on the screen of gay menand lesbians exhorting the crowds to vote. ‘Voting for Our Lives,’ say the signs ingay bars, bookstores and churches.”5 Another article in the same press reported onactivity in San Francisco, where local officials “estimate that 95 percent of eligiblevoters are registered, in large part because of intensive voter-registration drives ingay neighborhoods.”62For more information about this data set, see (Ghaziani 2014b). The public conversation thatit represents includes 27 urban, suburban, and rural locations, and it spans 40 years of coverage(1970 to 2010). For a companion discussion about why straight people say they want to live in agayborhood, see (Ghaziani 2019d).3“S.F.’s Castro District Faces an Identity Crisis,” by Wyatt Buchanan.

New York Times, November 1, 1992, section 4, page 1.92 A. GhazianiThe 2008 presidential race provides an example of the enduring capacity ofgayborhoods to serve as voting blocs. A story in the Windy City Times reported,“Data available on voting in heavily gay precincts suggests the gay vote for Obamawas at an unprecedented high. In the last several presidential elections, the percentageof LGB voters supporting the Democrat has hovered around 70 to 75 percent.” Theratio in the 2008 election was much higher. In Provincetown, 87% of the voterssupported Obama, compared to 11% for [John] McCain. In San Francisco, 85%voted for Obama versus 13% for McCain. In Philadelphia’s gayborhood, 83% ofvoters supported Obama. He also won 89% of the vote in Dupont Circle, 63% ofDallas’s gay neighborhood, and 86% of Chicago’s Boystown.7LGBTQ people are more interested in politics, more interested in public affairs,and more likely to be engaged in civic and political activities than their heterosexualcounterparts (Egan et al. 2008). The examples that I have provided in this sectionsuggest that the queer vote is often a determining factor in elections. During electioncycles, gayborhood residents historically have often worn buttons on their bags toproclaim the power of their vote, and they have organized voter registration driveson the streets as well (Images 4.1 and 4.2).Image 4.1 Voter registration drives in the gayborhood.

Because homosexuality is not universally or unambiguously visibleon the body, queer people encounter unique challenges in finding each other for sex,dating, and mating. Gayborhoods can make things a little easier. The New YorkTimes interviewed residents of Greenwich Village who reflected on what drew themto the neighborhood before it gentrified: “Older residents recall another era, when94 A. Ghazianithe street was paved not with gold, but with gays. That was what put ChristopherStreet on the cultural map, the old-timers say wistfully. ‘It was one big cruisingstreet,’” said one resident who has lived in the neighborhood since the 1960s. Thejournalist added, “Gay men (the area never attracted a large lesbian population)carried the sidewalks as late as 1990, turning the street into a genuine carnival dayand night. The waterfront, once a desolate truck yard, was a 24-hour playground ofsexual trysts and flamboyant acts. By day, nude sunbathers staked out an urban beachon disfigured docks…‘Straight people avoided Christopher Street,’” said the sameresident, because it was “America’s gay Main Street.”8 Residents like these dependon the streets of gayborhoods, which are often shielded from the heterosexual gaze,to connect with each other.Nearly four decades later and across the country, people still appreciate the streetsof gayborhoods for their sexual networking opportunities. An editorial in the Advo-cate reflected on West Hollywood’s twentieth anniversary as “America’s first gaycity” (it was incorporated on November 29, 1984): “I’m not arguing thatWest Holly-wood is a perfect city, or even a gay mecca. But it is a special place…Whatever itsflaws, it was a city that let people be themselves and make their own choices aboutwhom they loved and how,without judgment or condemnation or shame.”9 A reporterfrom the Village Voice summarized a sensibility he heard from residents across thecountry: “Like any identity group, gay men and lesbians want to be with their ownkind. It’s also easier to hook up—for a night or a lifetime.”10 Artistic renderings ofthis theme depict a same-sex couple in traffic lights in the gayborhood (Image 4.3).Safe Spaces. Despite the statistical liberalization of attitudes toward homosexu-ality across the country (Twenge et al. 2015), many queer people find that the streetsof gay neighborhoods feel safer than elsewhere in the city. Bob Witeck, CEO ofWiteck Communications, Inc., a public relations and marketing communicationsfirm that specializes in the queer consumer market, offered an observation based onhis interactions with clients: “‘It’s about whether you can hold your partner’s hand inpublic, whether you’re safe from harassment or physical violence.’”11 Brian Orter, aphotographer and commercial lighting designer who lives in Hell’s Kitchen, agreed.“I remember growing up in the city being gay in the ‘70s and ‘80s, and it was scary.So, I’m not going to go and move into a neighborhood where I am scared. I want tobe near Chelsea and theWest Village, where there are safe, gay people.”12 A reporterfrom theWashington Post compared the gayborhood with Ellis Island: “That’s whatGreenwich Village has always been. A kind of Ellis Island for generations of gay8“Street Fight,” by Denny Lee. New York Times, March 31, 2002, section 14, page 1.9“WeHo, Warts and All,” by John Morgan Wilson.

A reporterfor the Philadelphia Daily News interviewed a high-school senior who “felt likeshe was home yesterday, walking the streets in the Gayborhood during OutFest, thePhilly Pride event held each year on National Coming Out Day. But she’s not ‘athome’ in her house. Her ‘very Christian’ parents are unaware that she’s a lesbian, the17-year-old said. ‘In my area, it’s very conservative—going to these places is veryfreeing because you can be yourself here. It feels like you’re not alone.’”15Safety is a pronounced concern for queer youth of color. A writer for the NewYork Times notes, “For as long as Darnell could remember, the western edge ofChristopher Street, with is rotting piers and dark alleys, had been a refuge for so-called pier kids like him. Black and Latino, and often from poor families that rejectthem for being gay, they are drawn to the street’s bleak fringes by a need to definethemselves through the company of soul mates…‘Where I come from, you can’t beblack and gay,’ said Darnell. ‘So we call this our home.’”16 Twenty-one-year-oldcollege student Antonio Jones felt similarly. A journalist for the Chicago Tribune13“Greenwich Time: On the Stonewall anniversary, a gay tour of Village history,” by Paula Span.Washington Post, June 22, 1994, page D1.14“Gay Businesses Follow Influx of Gay People,” by Marvine Howe.

New York Times, March 31, 2002, section 14, page 1.96 A. Ghazianiobserved, “Young gaymen from the city’s South andWest sides come to Boystown tovisit the Center on Halsted [the LGBTQ community center], whose youth programsmake them feel safe, affirmed, and valued.” Jones told the reporter that “many of theyouth come from communities that historically have been hostile to gays” who then“find in Boystown a refuge. Often, it’s the first time the teens, the majority of whomare black, really can be themselves.”17Image 4.4 shows an ad for a public programming event in Boystown that wasproduced by Honey Pot Performance, an Afro-diasporic feminist collaborative inChicago that uses artistic expressions to examine questions of identity, belonging,community, and difference. Co-sponsored in 2019 by the Chicago Black SocialCulture Map, the Modern Dance Music Archiving Foundation, and the Center onHalsted, the event included community archiving on site, oral histories, and paneldiscussions that celebrated nightlife’s queer roots, reflected on the significance ofpublic events like Black Pride, and explored the importance of iconic spots and“anchor institutions” (Ghaziani 2014a: 383) in the gayborhood.

When gayborhoods were first forming, many people whomoved there saw themselves as members of a minority group who needed to takecare of each other—not just socially but also in an economic sense. Bars, bathhouses,bookstores, and other businesses that targeted a queer niche market emerged toservice the newly visible residents (Ghaziani 2015b). A journalist writing for theAdvocate interviewed Elmwood Hopkins, managing director of Emerging MarketsInc., a consulting firm in Los Angeles. Hopkins remarked on the historical arc ofthe pink economy, offering important lessons for urban planners who try to eitherpreserve or reinvigorate neighborhoods:Most urbanplanners try to revive neighborhoods in a backwardmanner bybuilding affordablehousing and then hoping people move into the area. Instead, he says, restaurants, shops, artstudios, and other services should be there first. Then the residents will come. Gay men andlesbians realized that years ago, he says, when in the 1920s and 1930s they gravitated towardcertain neighborhoods in cities across the United States. Their presence led gay bars andother businesses to open, and then more residents arrived.20The pink economy gained momentum as gayborhoods became more institutionallycomplete. “We’re at a tipping point, with gays coming out in society and business,”said a queer hospitality consultant in San Francisco to the USA Today. “All of asudden, we’ve become a great market for all industries to go after.”21 Peak visibilityarrived on June 2, 2004 when the Greater Philadelphia TourismMarketing Company(GPTMC) launched a multimillion-dollar television campaign to lure lesbian andgay tourists to their city. On a winter afternoon in 2003, in a conference room thatoverlooked the Ben Franklin Bridge, six marketing strategists met and devised acatchy campaign: “Get your history straight and your nightlife gay.” The ad madePhiladelphia “the first destination in the world to produce a gay-themed televisioncommercial.Never before has aU.S. city, resort, or international destinationused tele-vision advertising to invite gay travelers to visit.”22 The Washington Post describedthe ad:‘My dearest beloved,’ the voice-over starts, as a presumably 18th-century fellow writesimpassionedly in the television commercial. ‘How I long to be with you, to see your radiant18https://www.honeypotperformance.org/events/2019/10/19/chicago-black-social-culture-map-queer-nightlife-amp-youth-culture-northside-edition.19For a challenge to the argument that gayborhood streets feel safe for queer people of color, see(Hanhardt 2013).20“There Goes the Gayborhood,” by Fred Kuhr.

A front-page Philadelphia Inquirer article described the effort: “Thetheme is ‘Get your history straight and your nightlife gay.’” The three-year, $900,000effort sought “to integrate Philadelphia’s historical and cultural offerings with gay-specific attractions.”24 The strategyworked; Philadelphia saw a $153 return for everydollar that it spent on its marketing campaign. Bruce Yelk, the Director of PublicRelations, said that the ad took the “City of Brotherly Love” from an unranked posi-tion on Community Marketing’s “Top 10 U.S. Destinations for the LGBT Traveler”list to the number ten spot. Image 4.5 shows several expressions from the campaign.Philadelphia’s success motivated more than 75 cities around the world to adopt queertourism campaigns.25Activism and Protest. An incitement to insurgency requires people to define theirsituation as unjust and to feel optimistic about their prospects for change. This type ofculture work—redefining what a situation means—happens on the ground in specificplaces. Consider an example fromDadeCounty (Miami). Former beauty queen (MissOklahoma, 1958, and second runner-up forMissAmerica, 1959) and recording artist-turned-born-again Christian evangelist mother Anita Bryant became involved in acampaign called “Save Our Children.” Bryant proclaimed that “the recruitment ofour children is absolutely necessary for the survival and growth of homosexuality.”She personalized her message by expressing concern over the wellbeing of her ownchildren: “As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproducechildren; therefore, they must recruit our children.” As part of her campaign and withthe aid of fundamentalist churches and conservative Roman Catholic groups, Bryantdisplayed images from San Francisco’s pride parades and argued that the city was“a cesspool of sexual perversion gone rampant.” Shen then cautioned local voters,“Don’t let Miami become another San Francisco.” Residents found her messagecompelling and voted by a margin of more than 2-to-1 in a referendum to repeal alaw that protected gaymen and lesbians fromdiscrimination in employment, housing,and public accommodation (Ghaziani 2008: 33).The Florida fight unleashed protests across the country, many of which wereorganized in gay neighborhoods. A Washington Post story observed, “A gay causecan quickly become a neighborhood cause. Soon after Anita Bryant’s recent victoryin a Miami homosexual rights referendum, most of the restaurants around Dupont23“Philadelphia Invites Gay Tourists in TV Ad,” by Robert Strauss.Washington Post, July 3, 2004,page A03.24“New Tourism Ads: Come out and visit,” by Marcia Gelbart.

A front-page story in theNew York Times described the power ofgayborhood streets for social movement mobilization efforts: “While the Castro hasbeen the center of amovement, it is also home to ‘an important political constituency.26“The Gay Life at Dupont Circle,” by Robert F. Levey.Washington Post, June 16, 1977, page DC1.See also coverage in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/1977/06/08/archives/miami-votes-2-to-1-to-repeal-law-barring-bias-against-homosexuals.html.100 A. GhazianiImage 4.5 (continued)Image 4.5 (continued)When people were angry about Dan White, they were able to assemble quickly,spilling out of bars [into the streets]…Physical location mattered.’”27 White receiveda lenient sentence of voluntary manslaughter. Outrage in San Francisco’s gay andlesbian community sparked the “White Night riots” on May 21, 1979. Protesters setablaze eleven police cars and smashed the windows of City Hall, holding up placardsthat read, “Did Harvey Milk Die for Nothing?”In the 1980s, queer communities across the United States used gayborhoods torespond to the AIDS crisis. A reporter for the New York Times commented, “Sociol-ogists and demographers alike say the concentration of homosexuals in core neigh-borhoods has grown in the last two decades out of gay political advocacy and the27“Gay Enclaves Face Prospect of Being Passé,” by Patricia Leigh Brown.New York Times, October30, 2007, page A1.4 Why Gayborhoods Matter: The Street Empirics … 101AIDS crisis.”28 A writer for the San Francisco Chronicle added that mobilizationin gay districts helped to lower infection rates: “When AIDS finally was identified,whitemiddle-class gaysmobilized powerfully, and over time their efforts drove downinfection rates in San Francisco’s Castro district.”29In response to escalating anti-gay hate crimes in the 1990s, queer people againused their residential concentration in gayborhoods to redefine their situation asunjust and to respond to it. Spikes in gay bashing and murders “accelerated our plansto do something to take back our streets,” one New Yorker said. Another remarked,“It’s one horror story after another. Every day I hear about a friend or someone Iknow getting hurt.My lover and Iwere almost physically attacked in the East Village.We’re verbally harassed all the time, called ‘dykes’ and ‘queers’ and ‘what’s wrongwith you’…Our message is, ‘we’re bashing back.’”30Christopher Street residents formed a group called the “Pink Panthers,” a neigh-borhood foot patrol who monitored city streets. Writing for the Washington Post,Paula Span remarked on group’s name, logo, and activities:They could have called themselves somethingmore prosaic, neighborhood anti-crime patrolsbeing nothing new, after all…But gay activism, New York-style, requires a certain ironicpanache…The Pink Panthers title, with its echoes both of ‘60s politicization and silver-screen camp, won swift approval. The group’s logo – an inverted pink triangle bearing apaw print – was invented that very night. In the few weeks since, says founder Gerri Wells,about 150 people have volunteered to join the Panthers’ weekend patrols. From midnightuntil 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, armed only with whistles and squawky CB radiosand a series of training sessions, patrols of eight to 10 people in paw-printed black T-shirtsstride through the West Village. They watch; they jot down license plate numbers; they callthe police if they see trouble; they blow whistles to scare off assailants; they intervene toextricate victims.31The Pink Panthers provide “a searing response to the increased violence that hasaccompanied the general increase of gay visibility inAmerica” (Berlant and Freeman1993: 206). Activists appropriated confrontational strategies of the black powermovement—but with a twist: “Dressed in black T-shirts with pink triangles enclosinga black paw print, they move unarmed in groups, linked by walkie-talkies and whis-tles. In choosing a uniform that explicitly marks them as targets, [they identify them-selves] as successors of the Black Power movement” (ibid.). The Panthers cultivatedtheir consciousness, and executed their protest campaigns, on gayborhood streets(Image 4.5).Gayborhoods became a base camp for marriage protests as well. The LGBTQmovement put marriage on its national agenda for the first time in 1987 at its third28“Gay Presence Leads to Revival of Declining Neighborhoods,” by Karen De Witt.

Couples, Inc., a Los Angeles-based organization fighting forlegal recognition of gay partners, organizedTheWedding, a ceremony that celebratedqueer relationships and demanded that their partnerships receive equal legal recog-nition as married heterosexuals (Ghaziani 2008). Three years after the Washingtonmarch, two lesbian couples and one gay male couple in Hawaii applied for marriagelicenses. Like others, they were refused. Unlike others, however, they filed a law suitagainst the state for denying their civil rights. In 1993, the Supreme Court of Hawaiidecided Baehr v. Lewin—a “ruling that roiled America” (Sullivan 1997: 104)—anddeclared that the denial of marriage licenses on the grounds of same-sex applica-tions violated the equal protection clause of the state’s constitution that outlawedsex-based discrimination.Fearing the effects of the ruling, California republican William J. Knight intro-duced a bill that would invalidate “anymarriage contracted outside this state betweenindividuals of the same gender.” The bill passed the Assembly 41 to 33 on January31, 1996. In response, a protest group called the Freedom to Marry Task Force ofNorthern California “collected 1,600 letters in the heart of San Francisco’s largestgay neighborhood, opposingMr. Knight’s bill.” Onemember commented onwhy thegayborhood mattered for their actions: “When we stand there [in the Castro] with theFreedom to Marry banner, people swarm over.”32 These early campaigns motivatedactivists to jump into the fray and organize for marriage equality (see Ghaziani et al.2016 for review).32“Fearing a Toehold for GayMarriages, Conservatives Rush to Bar theDoor,” byDavidW.Dunlap.New York Times, March 6, 1996, page A13.4 Why Gayborhoods Matter: The Street Empirics … 103From Anita Bryant to Dan White, and from the AIDS crisis to hate crimes andmarriage equality—each of these examples shows with particular force how spatialconcentration cultivates political consciousness and protest. All of this happens onthe streets. Building gayborhoods was “inseparable from the development of the gaycommunity as a social movement” (Castells 1983: 157). In today’s climate of greaterlegislative equality, gayborhoods provide an abeyance (Taylor 1989) functionality,allowing queer people to stand on guard and ready to resist any injustices that maycome their way.Community Building. Like attracts like. This is a well-established fact of humanlife, one that sociologists call homophily. Geography is a key precondition forhomophily. “We are more likely to have contact with those who are closer to usin geographic location than those who are distant” (McPherson et al. 2001: 429).These academic insights filter down to the streets of the gayborhood as well. Oneresident from Asbury Park, NJ explained why she moved to the area: “There’s anacceptance here, a feeling of community, and there are a few gathering places forgay and lesbian people.”33 A New Yorker similarly pointed to the social aspects ofseeking community in the city: “This is the only place to be ourselves, to be withpeople who are like ourselves and not be looked down on.”34 A journalist for theVillage Voice offered the same observation: “Like any identity group, gay men andlesbians want to be with their own kind.”35Whereas the social aspects of community building point to the relational bene-fits that gayborhoods provide, the cultural component highlights the symbolic andexpressive aspects of its streets. Regina Quattrochi, the former director of the NewYorkCityAIDSResourceCenter, argues that gayborhoods have always promoted thecelebration of queer cultures: “Even as recently as the early and mid-1980s, I thinkthe Village was symbolic of a sort of celebration of gay culture.”36 TheWashingtonPost playfully compared gayborhoods to Oz:For decades, the gay neighborhoods of San Francisco, NewYork, andWashington embodiedthe promise of change, freedom, friendship, and acceptance. Greeting cards and T-shirts wereemblazoned with the slogan ‘I have a feeling we’re not in Kansas anymore.’ To come out ofthe closet, to move to those gay utopias, was to be swept up by a tornado and dropped intoOz. The black-and-white landscape dissolved into color…Reborn, gay men often find thatold assumptions about family, love, and community fall away as well. In the ‘70s, men oncederided as sissies remade themselves into ‘Castro clones,’ with cowboy boots and button-flyLevi’s, plaid shirts and leather jackets, and studiously well-muscled bodies.3733“Move Over, Fire Island, Here Comes Asbury Park,” by Jill P.

GhazianiWe also hear the importance of community building in debates about whether tomunicipally mark gayborhoods. In 1997, Chicago became the first city in the worldto use tax dollars to formally designate a section of its East Lakeview neighborhoodas “Boystown.” It did so by installing rainbow-colored art deco pylons along NorthHalsted Street (Image 4.7).A local paper published a front-page editorial article that expressed skepticismabout the city’s decision: “Why should a neighborhood have a public sexual desig-nation when sex is the ultimate private act? Why would gay people want to officiallyghettoize themselves when they’ve fought so hard not to be ostracized?” The writerImage 4.7 Rainbow pylonsin Chicago’s gayborhood(Source Photo by GaryBaker. Reprinted withpermission)4 Why Gayborhoods Matter: The Street Empirics … 105Image 4.8 Rainbow streetsigns in Philadelphia (SourcePhoto by J. Smith. Reprintedwith permission from VisitPhiladelphia)interviewed Tracy Baim, who managed local queer periodicals, for answers. In herresponse, Baim combined several themes from this chapter:The city’s plan isn’t about sex, it’s about community. Society has forced us to define ourselvesas a community to protect ourselves…Community has given gays the force to fight againsthate crimes, against job discrimination and housing bias. The gay community has becomefamily for gayswhose families have thrown themout. The city’s plan simplywould recognizethat community, along with the work it has done to turn the neighborhood into a place wherestraight people, along with gays, want to shop, eat and live. Why does the city do it forChinatown? Why does it do it for Greektown? Because it helps bring pride to an area oftown that has traditionally been built by those communities.38Richard Daley, who was mayor at the time, agreed: “I knew from the beginning itwas about fairness—fairness to this community. I am thanking you for what you (theLGBTQ community) have done for North Halsted Street for many, many years.”39A similar conversation happened in Philadelphia ten years later whenMayor JohnF. Street dedicated thirty-six new street signs to celebrate the city’s queer community(Image 4.8).The Philadelphia Daily News remarked on the significance of the street signs:‘Welcome to the ‘Gayborhood.’ A welcoming vibe is what organizers hope to inspire whenvisitors see new street signage that will designate a portion of the Center City District as thecity’s official gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender-sensitive neighborhood…the new streetsigns will feature the traditional GLBT rainbow, or ‘Freedom’ flag underneath the usualstreet signs…‘The signage is an important symbol for this city,’ [said Tami Sortman of the38“Gaytown Enters Gray Area of Community Naming,” by Michael Schmich. Chicago Tribune,August 17, 1997, page 1.39“Gay-Pride Halsted Street Project Ends in Harmony,” by Lola Smallwood. Chicago Tribune,November 15, 1998, page 3.106 A. GhazianiPhiladelphia Gay Tourism caucus]. ‘We can say that we have a neighborhood…Not onlydoes this bring a sense of welcoming to the local community, it’s a symbol to the world.’40The image of gayborhoods as a cultural mecca occurs repeatedly in the nationalmedia. A front-page story in the San Francisco Chronicle from 1996 quoted a Castroresident who said, “I knew I had to get out of Nebraska in 1971. San Francisco was amecca for gay people like me.” A year later, the same press described the Castro as aplace that “drew thousands of gays from all over the country because they believed itwas their own mecca-in-the-making.” By 1999, it declared that the district was “theworld’s gay mecca.”41San Francisco is not alone in its use of the imagery of mecca. Some reportersdescribe Provincetown, MA as “a gay mecca in the summer months,” while NewYorkers add, “To the old-timers, Christopher Street was, and should stay, NewYork’sGay Mecca, where the promise of liberation remains alive.”42In 1994, New York commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.That year, the Washington Post ran a poignant story, worth quoting at length, thatblended Islamic and American images to celebrate its gayborhoods:There will be a constant stream of pilgrims coming to gaze at the brick-and-stucco facadeof the Stonewall over the next few days. Because a police raid turned into a riot there25 years ago, because the patrons of a gay bar did not go gently into a paddy wagon,hundreds of thousandsof peoplewill descendonNewYork for aweekendof commemoration.The neighborhood surrounding the old saloon, a hangout-turned-landmark, will become aninternational mecca, a symbol of gay liberation.But that’s what Greenwich Village has always been. A kind of Ellis Island for generationsof gay men and lesbians, a crucible of gay history since before the Jazz Age, it is America’smost celebrated gay enclave. What the Village offered was a handful of places where gaypeople could reveal themselves: a cafeteria here, a bar there, a park, a bookstore, eventually acommunity center. But what it provided was freedom. ‘It’s a mythic place,’ says Joan Nestle,co-founder of the Lesbian Herstory Archives.Sometime in the 1970s, San Francisco’s Castro district eclipsed the Village as a nationalmecca and a political power base… Other New York neighborhoods have drained awaysome of its functions. The gay middle class has largely decamped for Chelsea, a few blocksuptown, which now boasts blocks of new restaurants, bars and boutiques. The most vibrantlesbian community in the city is across the river in Brooklyn’s Park Slope. And the crowdthat generates performance art, cutting-edge music, fashion and attitude is headquartered inthe East Village. Yet the neighborhood’s hold on the imagination remains powerful. And thisweekend, it will again be at the heart of everything.4340“New Signs Make it Official: We have a ‘Gayborhood,’” by Damon C. Williams.

This is probablywhy people who are seen or see themselves asprimarily homosexual have acceded to their own subculturalization in gay ghettos.”44In this sense, gayborhoods resemble the totems that Durkheim described in his studyof religious life. In both instances, there is a common motivation to seek the sacredand celebrate as its source ourselves and our communities. This type of work—fromsocializing to community building and transcendence—happens on the streets ofgayborhoods as people interact with their neighbors, visitors, and tourists alike.4.3 ConclusionsIn this chapter, I identified six major reasons that queer people have shared withjournalists across the United States about why gayborhoods matter to them. Myfindings show that gay districts provide access to courtship and partnership possibil-ities, influence elections, provide a perception of safer streets, offer access to queerbusinesses and institutions, enable social movement organizing, and are the conduitsof community building. Together, these residential logics provide insights into themotivations, meanings, interpretations, and interactions that uniquely happen on thestreets of gay neighborhoods (Table 4.2).Research in gayborhood studies often assumes that we need to isolatemacro struc-tural factors like the economy (e.g., real estate values), culture (e.g., assimilation),politics (e.g., legislation and public opinion), and technology (e.g., geo-aware appslike Grindr) to study these urban districts. This assumption originates from domi-nant theoretical traditions in urban sociology (e.g., Abrahamson 2005; Castells 1976;Logan andMolotch 1987; Molotch 1976; Orum and Chen 2003; Sassen 2001; Zukin1987), especially the Chicago School (Park 1915; Park and Burgess 1925).A “supra-individual” approach (Sampson 2012: 23) like this, and the assumptionsthat it forces researchers to make, persists in contemporary research about the cityas well. Consider a recent call by Wu (2016: 126) that “urban sociology should beunderstood as the sociology of city.” Bymaking this move, scholars would focus lesson “social problems within an urban context”—like influencing elections, finding asexual or romantic partner, feeling safe, looking for specialty stores or non-profits,mobilizing against real or perceived threats, and desiring the company of similarothers—and instead analyze “the city as an autonomous social unit” (ibid.). Wu’srecommendation is provocative, and productive, but unless we texture our impres-sions of the city with the meaning-making processes that happen on the ground—astreet empirics, as call it—our knowledge will be incomplete. For Wu, the goal is44“Bringing Clarity to an Elusive Reality,” by Joseph Coates.Chicago Tribune, May 2, 1991, page 3.108 A. GhazianiTable 4.2 The street empirics of the gayborhoodResidential logics: Why do you live in thegayborhood?Street empirics: Why do gayborhoods matter?Voting blocs and elections “Having a specific neighborhood that politicianscan point to has really solidified the gay vote,our political muscle”Sex and love “Gay men and lesbians want to be with theirown kind. It’s easier to hook up—for a night or alifetime”Safe spaces “It’s about whether you can hold your partner’shand in public, whether you’re safe fromharassment or physical violence”The pink economy “Restaurants, shops, art studios, and otherservices should be there first. Then the residentswill come”Activism and protest “When AIDS finally was identified, whitemiddle-class gays mobilized powerfully, andover time their efforts drove down infectionrates in San Francisco’s Castro district”Community building “That’s what Greenwich Village has alwaysbeen. A kind of Ellis Island for generations ofgay men and lesbians”“treating the city as the unit of analysis” (ibid.), but this mandate will also abstractour view too far away from the streets.In this chapter, I have called on urbanists to embrace an analytic strategy of streetempirics. Those sidewalks where people walk, talk, and interact with each otherprovide a foundational unit of analysis for scholars who are interested in under-standing what a place means to its residents. By accepting this methodological direc-tive, we can use the reasons that gayborhood residents provide for why they live inthe area, like other residents in other neighborhoods, to explain the significance of aplace.My call for prioritizing street empirics to understand what a neighborhoodmeans—why it matters to the people who live there—enables scholars to thinkbroadly about the interactional and attitudinal mechanisms that produce place char-acters. As an analytic approach, street empirics is methodologically robust. Considerthat I write these words in the middle of a pandemic. Covid-19 has motivated manypeople to recalibrate how and why places influence them. One headline wonderedabout the significance of cities: “Coronavirus may prompt migration out of Amer-ican cities.” Others mused about queer cultures—“Of Pride in Pandemic Times”—and queer spaces: “Can LGBTQ bars survive the Covid-19 pandemic?”45 My data45Migration out of cities: https://theharrispoll.com/coronavirus-may-prompt-migration-out-of-american-cities/; Pride: https://shepherdexpress.com/lgbtq/my-lgbtq-pov/of-pride-in-pandemic-times/;LGBTQbars: https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2020/06/12/can-lgbtq-bars-survive-through-covid-19.html.4 Why Gayborhoods Matter: The Street Empirics … 109predates the pandemic, but I imagine that future researchers can still use streetsempirics to systematically analyze how Covid-19 affected the meanings of urbangay districts. Moments of crisis compel creative responses, and we now have anotherapproach in our toolkit that we can use to advance gayborhood studies.ReferencesAbrahamson M (2005) Urban enclaves: identity and place in the world, 2nd ed.

At thesame time, prevelence and use of the rainbowflag and the rainbowmotif has increasedin areas not usually considered part of recognized gay neighborhoods. This chapterexplores the prevalence and persistence of the display of the rainbowflag and rainbowmotif in nine neighborhoods across Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The visual assessmentof rainbow flag use across these neighborhoods serves as a potential model for exam-ining the rate of spread of rainbow flags and visual rainbowmotif symbols as ameansfor tracking the movement of the LGBTQ+ community across urban neighborhoods.Initial results suggest potential significance of the prevalence and persistence ofthe rainbow flag and the rainbow motif. These include; (1) a possible diaspora ofLGBTQ+ residents from traditionally defined gay neighborhoods to newly emerginggay or LGBTQ-friendly neighborhoods, (2) a newfound inclusivity or pride amongresidents of other neighborhoods, and (3) “rainbow washing” due to overuse of therainbow motif by non-LGBTQ businesses and organizations connected with pridecelebrations. While overuse of the rainbow flag may diminish historically codedmeaning of the rainbow, that well-intentioned use of the rainbow flag is a positiveand welcoming indicator for LGBTQ+ individuals and it may lead to the emergenceof additional LGBTQ-friendly enclaves that, over time, could potentially emerge asnew gay neighborhoods.Keywords Rainbow flag · Rainbow motif · Gay neighborhoods · Place branding ·Toronto · Rainbow washingA.

Bitterman5.1 Rainbow Flag: Visibility, Implication, and MeaningThe rainbow flag has signified safety and community to LGBTQ+ people for fiftyyears. Display of the flag in and around gay neighborhoods has grown continuallyas a result of pride celebrations each summer, but concentrations of the rainbowflag and rainbow motif are beginning to appear in areas outside of established gayneighborhoods. This chapter examines the concentration and persistence of displayof the rainbow flag across nine neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada—one establishedgay neighborhood, one affluent neighborhood to the north, and seven other neighbor-hoods concentrated in theWest end of the city—using the rainbow flag (and rainbowmotif) as a means to visualize the “gayness” or LGBTQ-friendliness of a specificneighborhood, but also as a means to identify the potential emergence of LGBTQ-inclusive neighborhoods and enclaves. This study relies on a planned and coordinatedfield data collection effort across these nine neighborhoods over a three-year periodand charts the growth in use of the rainbow flag over this same period.5.2 A Capsule History of the Rainbow FlagThe rainbow flag was designed in 1970 by gay-rights activist Gilbert Baker in SanFrancisco. San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk suggested that Baker develop asymbol of pride for the LGBTQ+ community as an alternative to the pink trianglewhich was commonly used by the gay community in an effort to reclaim the symbolused to visually brand homosexuals throughout Nazi Germany. For the prototype ofthe initial flag, Baker dyed fabrics of brilliant color that he sewed into a striped banner.Each color had a meaning: hot pink for sexuality, red for life, orange for healing,yellow for the sun, green for nature, turquoise blue for art, indigo for harmony, andviolet for spirit. Baker recounts the moment when his new flag was first raised: “itcompletely astounded me that people just got that this was their flag. It belonged toall of us. I knew right then that this was the most important thing I would ever do—that my whole life was going to be about the rainbow flag” (San Francisco TravelAssociation 2019).Later, the rainbow flag was modified by using a seven stripe-version (red, orange,yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) because fuchsia pink fabric proved too difficultto source (Martel 2018; Albin 2009) and has since been endlessly adapted to visuallydemonstrate inclusivity for all identities under the LGBTQ+ umbrella. ThroughoutSan Francisco the original rainbow flag slowly became recognized throughout the1970s as a symbol of gay community. Following the assassination of San FranciscoMayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978, the flag became arallying symbol for LGBTQ+ individuals and was flown from light poles alongboth sides of Market Street for the 1979 Gay Freedom Day Parade (San FranciscoTravel Association 2019). The rainbow motif was used as the cover of the Paradeprogram the following year, as depicted in Fig. 5.2. The flag was eventually modified5 The Rainbow Connection: A Time-Series … 119into a six-stripe Rainbow Flag and was used to identify gay-friendly homes andbusinesses throughout San Francisco (San Francisco Travel Association 2019) asshown in Fig. 5.1, which became a visual code to LGBTQ+ individuals implying asafe welcoming space under the rainbow banner (Martel 2018). The flag continuesFig. 5.1 The rainbow flag and rainbow motif used as a place brand throughout the Castro in SanFransisco (Source Image by author)120 A. Bittermanto grow in popularity and is ever-changing to include emergent groups that identifywith LGBTQ+ rights.Use of the rainbow flag to signify LGBTQ-friendly space continued, as shownin Fig. 5.3, and use of the flag spread to other gay neighborhoods outside of SanFrancisco. John Stout of West Hollywood litigated in 1988 for the right to displaya rainbow flag on the balcony of his apartment (San Francisco Travel Association2019). Hewon this fight and, as a result, display and popularity of the flag throughoutthe West Hollywood gay neighborhood grew. Similarly, LGBTQ-friendly establish-ments in other gay neighborhoods began to display the rainbow flag (Martel 2018)as a symbol of gay pride and inclusivity and to signify safe spaces for gay people. By1993, the rainbow motif—not simply the flag—was being used at the then-largestLGBTQ+ march on Washington (San Francisco Travel Association 2019), claimingit as the predominant symbol of gay pride and inclusivity.The rainbow flag (and the rainbow motif) are unique in that for much of thepast fifty years, the codified significance of the flag required a degree of “insider”knowledge to understand the meaning signified by display of the flag. While therainbow flag broadcast to LGBTQ+ individuals an open and welcoming invitation(Bitterman and Hess 2016b), for many years, most of straight society did not knowabout the flag or its meaning, and some thought it was simply a colorful banner. Eventoday, some still do (Wareham 2020). The coded significance of the flag is importantto its evolution and adaptation over time.The rainbow flag and motif was also not without detractors in the LGBTQ+community, however. Doan (2015) cites one such case of a self-identified lesbianwoman who wondered why anyone would want to fly a rainbow flag on their homeand thereby advertise their location and potentially make themselves a target for crit-icism or discrimination. Some within the LGBTQ+ community felt that the flag wasostentatious, and some implied the colorful flagwas “tacky” or “too gay” (WeHoVilleStaff 2012). Popularity of the rainbow flag, and its important meaning of inclusionwon over the small criticisms or concerns. Over the past fifty years, the rainbow flaghas become a visual symbol of the struggle for LGBTQ+ inclusion and has been usedto signify specific locations of gay-friendly businesses, homes, and accommodationsacross the world. The rainbow color motif, once a coded signal to LGBTQ+ indi-viduals that they are welcome, included, and safe, (Bitterman and Hess 2016a) hasbecome a widely recognized universal symbol and visual shorthand for LGBTQ+inclusion especially among the LGBTQ+ and allied communities (Bitterman andHess 2016b).5.3 The Rainbow Flag as Place Brand for GayNeighborhoodsThe rainbowflag, an internationally recognized symbol of gay pride, could be consid-ered a place brand. It has been used for about five decades to “brand”LGBTQ+ spaces5 The Rainbow Connection: A Time-Series … 121Fig. 5.2 The rainbowmotif used on the cover of the 1980 San FranciscoGay FreedomDay program(Source Image by author)and neighborhoods. However, unlike most place brands, the flag is no longer specificto any one location, but instead a “type” of location which makes it a highly unusualsort of place brand.The rainbow flag is unique in that its origins are not only grassroots, but it isalso place-agnostic, used to denote connection and acceptance of those under the122 A. Bittermanprotection of the LGBTQ+ umbrella, regardless of location. Developed as a laborof love, the rainbow flag has been widely adopted and modified, and its success isperpetuated by its power to unite marginalized sexual minorities. The rainbow flagassists LGBTQ+ people in proudly expressing sexual orientation or gender identity,and it signifies the places these sexual minorities have struggled to designate ascollective communities safe frompersecution andmarginalization from the dominantgroup. There are few examples of place brandswhich are used to demarcate particularspaces but that also transcend borders. Other rare examples of universally identifiablevisual elements used to denote place include red, white, and blue striped barber polesand the red cross symbol used to denote first aid or medical facilities (Bitterman2008).More typical place brands encompass attitudes and perceptions about specificplaces and are used to promote these locales to visitors and potential residents as wellas to boost civic pride among current citizens. Place brands can be constituted from avariety of elements—a sign, a slogan, a logo, or an advertising campaign—that denoteplace. The iconic Hollywood sign, the IAMsterdam sign and campaign, and the I ♥NY logo and campaign are examples of visual efforts used to brand place (Bitterman2008). Place brands range in type, scale, and application. Typically developed andpromoted by a government, NGO, or corporation, Top-Down place brands tend to beplanned, cohesive, and comprehensive. Controlled by various rules for use for each ofthe visual elements constituting the brand—color, typography, imagery, and scale—Top-Down brands are usually accompanied by a plan for dissemination and foradministering the brand. These rules harmonize consistency in use of the brand acrossa broad range of media and scale in the built environment, which usually includes thedesign of street furniture, maps and kiosks, gateway signage, public transit systems(Hess and Bitterman 2008), wayfinding signage, smaller-scale print advertisements,and brochures, as well as digital applications such as websites and video productions.“Bottom-Up” or grassroots place brands, in contrast, are typically not sanctioned byan authority, but instead evolve in an organic fashion which tends to be spontaneous,decentralized, and fluid. I♥NY is one example of a grassroots place brand (Bitterman2008) and the rainbow flag is another. Despite careful rules for use, very few top-down place brands persist beyond five years. In contrast, many “grassroots” bottom-up place brands persist for many years as they tend to be developed and supportedby and for the people (Bitterman 2008).As the reputation and identity of gay neighborhoods began to solidify and once-secretive marginal spaces of gay life became bustling centers of economic, political,and social revolution residents and businesses in gay neighborhoods proudly andpublicly began to display the rainbow flag (Martel 2018) and motif as shown inFig. 5.3. The rainbow flag—a place brand non-specific to any one city, region, orcountry—became an international symbol of gay pride (Martel 2018) and visuallyis used to delimit the boundaries of gay neighborhoods.5 The Rainbow Connection: A Time-Series … 123Fig. 5.3 Examples of the rainbow flag and motif used to denote inclusive place. At left in NewYork City, at right in Cambridge, Massachusetts (Source Image by author)5.4 The Power of Graphics in the Built EnvironmentGraphics and visual elements—the constituent elements of place brands—are helpfulin influencing behavior and cultivating or reinforcing a sense of community andbelonging. Graphics also convey or signal meaning. Painted elements and color inthe built environment are two of the most common visual elements on which placebrands rely, and these graphic interventions across the built environment demonstratethe subtle power of surrounding graphics. A thin yellow or white line painted alonglanes of travel on a highway is one example of the power of graphics in the builtenvironment. Drivers and passengers in vehicles speed by in close proximity dividedonly by a thin painted line. Drivers have been taught to respect those simple lines,and pedestrians trust that when entering a crosswalk, the line will indicate to passingmotorists the necessity to yield to their presence. Graphic elements—lines, color,logos—hold meaning and importance, even when our reaction to that meaning is sofamiliar it becomes automatic (Bitterman 2008).Paint, color, and lines help humans to delimit space and to physically defineboundaries (Bitterman 2013). In the early 2000s, NYCDepartment of Transportationcommissioner urban planning Janette Sadik-Kahn led an effort to use little more thanpaint and street furniture to radically reorient streetscapes inManhattan fromvehicle-oriented spaces to people-oriented places (Bela 2015). These simple interventionshelped to change the paradigm of urban design simply by using color, paint, and lineto demarcate and suggest community space and separating forms of travel (driving,124 A. Bittermanbicycling, walking). These efforts may have been inspired by similar tactics in gayneighborhoods, which were among some of the first neighborhoods to use paint toproudly designate place by replicating the rainbow flag motif in crosswalks, trashbins, benches, murals, and other decorative applications, proudly identifying eventhe most mundane urban necessities as inclusive, friendly, and welcoming.Visual devices such as color and symbol help to define place (Bitterman 2013).For example, ethnic neighborhoods are often proudly festooned with cultural pridedenoted by festive flags, decorations, and symbols. The decoration of spaces asholidays draw near helps to visually reinforce the excitement of pending festivals.The display of a national or regional flag close to the time of ethnic holidays iscommon in ethnic neighborhoods. These practices are cyclical and occur at specifictimes each year to signify and commemorate specific holidays.Street furniture and visual elements are necessary components of the urban envi-ronment—utility poles, crosswalks, benches, curbstones, and signage of all types(street, traffic, roadway, advertisements)—and are omnipresent, but so common theseimportant elements have become forgettable. Urban street furniture and elements ofthe built environment are part of a visual cacophony that constitutes a typical urbanstreetscape. These public and prevalent elements in the built environment providean empty canvas on which to decorate, and are sometime employ visual elements toidentify the locations and culture of a specific neighborhood (Bitterman 2008).Invisible neighborhoods in plain sight, except to those “in the know,” and oftenlocated in otherwise disused areas of cities, gay neighborhoods were figurativelyand literally on the urban fringe for many years. The gay liberation and freedommovements of the 1970s and 1980s and the more recent gay pride movement pavedthe way for increased civil rights for LGBTQ+ individuals and greater acceptanceamong mainstream society in the 1990s and 2000s, and as a result the vibrant life,lively bars, and shops found among gay neighborhoods became a magnetic drawfor LGBTQ+ visitors. Between the 1970s and the early 2000s, gay neighborhoodsbecame centers of community life, commerce, and leisure for LGBTQ+ individualsand were—like all neighborhoods—in a state of constant change and reinvention.The rainbow flag and the rainbow motif have similarly helped to establish placeand visually delineate the presence and boundaries of gay neighborhoods (Bittermanand Hess 2021; Hess and Bitterman 2021). The rainbow motif is typically displayedas a striped fabric flag, but is sometimes painted onto crosswalks, applied to streetfurniture such as traffic control signs, public seating, trash receptacles, and banners,and incorporated into murals and public art (Hess and Bitterman 2021). Stickersfeaturing the rainbowmotif are often applied to the doors and windows of LGBTQ+-welcoming businesses.Across gay neighborhoods, rainbowflags, painted stripes, andthe rainbow motif have become commonplace on street furniture, murals, and otherinstallations marking the neighborhoods as welcoming spaces for LGBTQ+ visitors(Bitterman and Hess 2016b), and residents. Signs using the rainbow motif typicallyidentify and welcome people to the neighborhood alongside light poles festoonedwith banners that identify the gay neighborhood. The prevalence of the rainbowmotifhelped to brand—as well as identify and demarcate—gay neighborhoods as distinctgay spaces (Hess and Bitterman 2021).5 The Rainbow Connection: A Time-Series … 1255.5 Concentration and Persistence of Rainbow Flags DefineBoundaries of Gay NeighborhoodsDisplay of the rainbowflag, formuch of its use throughout history, had been primarilyconfined to gay neighborhoods, but use of the flag and rainbow motif has morerecently leaked beyond the boundaries of established gay neighborhoods into otherneighborhoods not traditionally associated with outward support of LGBTQ+ resi-dents and visitors and their human rights (Hinrichs 2020; Hess 2019). Over time,in concert with growing mainstream acceptance and increased legal and civil rights,the use of the rainbow motif has become more widely adopted, and now is commonacross LGBTQ-friendly businesses and spaces in many major cities. Observationaldata suggests that the rainbow flag and rainbow motif are now more widely adoptedthan other subcultural references that signify place in the urban environment. Whatdoes this sudden surge in display of the rainbow motif and rainbow flag indicate?The spread of the rainbow flag and rainbow motif in and around cities seems tosuggest a certain level of positivity and support—reflected in inclusivity, tolerance,and safety—associated with certain urban districts (Neville and Henrickson 2010).The prevalence of the rainbow flag in areas of cities not typically considered “gay”may suggest a variety of possible conditions: a diminished importance of more estab-lished gay neighborhoods, newfound pride among previously “quiet” or previouslycloseted members of the LGBTQ+ community, the emergence of new or fledglinggay neighborhoods, or increased support amongmainstreambusinesses and residentsfor LGBTQ+ rights and equality.This study seeks to understand how the concentration of rainbow flags and therainbow motif suggests the existence of a gay neighborhood or a LGBTQ-friendlyneighborhood.A related part of this inquiry examines the persistence of rainbowflagsand explores whether or not they appear only around the time of pride celebrationsrather than year round. Could dense concentrations of displayed rainbow flags inareas of cities not previously thought of as gay neighborhoods indicate potentialemergent gay enclaves or future gay neighborhoods? In this way, the rainbow flagcan be considered a visual indicator of a potentially LGBTQ-friendly enclave orperhaps even an embryonic gay neighborhood.The concentration of display and persistence in display of the rainbow flag are twomeasures that provide a possible means to gauge the physical genus loci, boundaries,and centers of gay neighborhoods. Similarly, rainbow flags can help to identify keyinstitutions within gay neighborhoods. One high-profile measure of the presence ofLGBTQ+ individuals (and their supporters) is the concentration of display of therainbow flag and motif across a defined area. Persistence of display also providesa means to visually track the concentration and spread of LGBTQ+ and LGBTQ-friendly presence throughout gay neighborhoods and areas immediately adjacent.“Rainbowwashing” refers to the appropriation or corporatized use of the rainbowflag for the financial gain of a business (Wired Staff 2018); this practice compromisesthe coded mean of the rainbow flag and rainbow motif. Rainbow washing weakensLGBTQ+ symbology, making the rainbow flag simply LGBTQ-friendly decorationin mainstream space.126 A. BittermanThis study employs a visual assessment method to observe and chart the concen-tration and persistence and implied spread of the rainbow flag across urban spacein Toronto. The purpose is to examine the prevalence and display of rainbow flagsacross urban districts as an indicator of identifiable gay neighborhoods; the methodis further used to explore the possibility of a urban gay diaspora from establishedgay neighborhoods to new neighborhoods across Toronto. This particular assessmentcollected visual data bimonthly along main thoroughfares in neighborhoods acrossToronto over a 3-year period between Autumn 2016 and Autumn 2019. In additionto the Church Street corridor (7) which anchors the established gay neighborhood inToronto (Gorman-Murray and Nash 2021), eight other areas were visually assessed.These include: Queen Street West (3), Queen Street along Bellwoods/Trinity/WestQueenWest (6), and Parkdale neighborhoods along Roncesvalles Avenue and QueenStreet West (2) inWest End; Roncesvalles Avenue in the “Roncy” Village (1); YongeStreet in theCentral BusinessDistrict (8), Bloor Street inYorkville (9),King/Bathurstin Fort York (5), and King West in Liberty Village (4) as shown in Fig. 5.4.Results from this exercise can shed new light on the use of the rainbow flagto designate urban space and on the shifting geographies of gay neighborhoods inToronto. Quantitative data from this study may yield important clues to the “spread”of tolerance, acceptance, and inclusion across Toronto, or itmay underscore a broadersocietal acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals, making the prevalence of rainbow flagsindicative but inconsequential. If indeed rainbow flags are simply residual visualFig. 5.4 Map of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, showing neighborhoods assessed: 1. Roncesvalles,2. Parkdale, 3. Bellwoods/Trinity/West Queen West, 4.

Yonge Street/Central Business District, 9.Bloor/Yorkville (Source Map by author)5 The Rainbow Connection: A Time-Series … 127indicators of broader societal acceptance, then a relative increase in the prominenceof flags would conceivably be found equally across most areas of the city. Onepotential limitation of this visual assessment is that as mainstream recognition andparticularly as use of the rainbow flag grows (especially among large corporateentities around the time of pride celebrations), the risk of rainbow washing becomesmore persistent. Further study will be required to determine consistent correlationand/or discontinuity over time.5.6 Empirical Plan for the Visual Assessment of RainbowFlag DisplayEach “neighborhood” encompassed all building façades visible fromboth sides alonga 1.5 km span of a major arterial road. These important commercial corridors provideimportant shops and amenities—bars, restaurants, cafés, access to public transit, gath-ering spaces—that anchor each neighborhood. During each assessment, the streetswere walked, façades along each thoroughfare were photographed, and the presenceof the any rainbow flag or motif was documented, geotagged, and time stamped.The photographs were assembled in a database and the number of instances talliedfor each neighborhood on each observation day. Each photograph provides a snap-shot of a specific place at a specific time and in series provide visual evidence ofthe emergence, retrenchment, and spread/retreat of the rainbow flag/motif. Theseimages were cataloged and compared over time to quantify both concentration andpersistence of the rainbow flag/motif. The aggregate number of instances for eachneighborhoodwas then compared over time. See Fig. 5.5. Comparing these snapshotsover time provides two important visual assessment indicators. The first is changerelated to seasonality (for example, a change in the number of rainbow flags aroundspecial events, such as pride celebrations). The second is longer-duration insightsabout neighborhood change provided by an increase in visual clues—rainbow flagsand motifs.The visual assessment survey aimed to minimize potential researcher bias whenexamining the data; that is, rainbow flags and motifs are counted as either present ornot. Subjective assessments about the application and expression of the mode (fabricflag, painted mural, graffiti, etc.) were also made but were not used in quantifyingmeasure. Similarly, quality (i.e., rainbow flags faded from the sun or tattered byweather which are no longer impressive) or size (i.e., very small stickers in shopwindows that do not make a large visual impact) was neither measured nor recorded.128 A. BittermanFig. 5.5 Emergence of rainbow motifs in areas not typically identified as gay neighborhoods.Photos on the left are from 2015–16, photos on the right are from 2017–20 (Source Images byauthor)5.7 Observations and FindingsThroughout the study area, the rainbow motif is prominently displayed in thestreetscape environment on various street furniture elements and at various scaleson building façades. Pride event-specific signs and flags on light posts or displayedover the street are clearly part of an organized effort. However, other examples—rainbow-painted benches and access ramps—are more grassroots, individualizedefforts. Other examples of public art and graffiti that supports the LGBTQ+ popula-tion such as rainbow-painted stairs that lead to a neighborhood church or the rainbowmotif storefront are arguably radical.5 The Rainbow Connection: A Time-Series … 129Figure 5.5 shows a small sample of before and after images of facades and streetfurniture from selected locations within the study areas. Over time, the emergence ofrainbowflags/motifs become discernible and the concentration in specific study areasbecomes notable. Figure 5.5 shows the evolution of one façade in the Roncesvallesneighborhood and two façades in the nearby Parkdale neighborhood. The rainbow-painted stairs at the church on Roncesvalles Avenue appeared around the late springor early summer of 2018, and has persisted and been maintained since. The rainbowmotif used into decorate the bench and adorn the entire façade of the nearby buildingon the other side of the road also appeared around pride celebrations in 2017, andhave persisted and been maintained since. Notably, over the period of study, therainbow motif on the Parkdale façade evolved slowly over time from a painted whitefaçade, to a white façade with rainbow stickers in the window, to a white façade withlarge rainbow posters in the window, to a fully painted rainbow façade that can beseen in the image on the lower right.Over the period of study, a steady overall increase is observed in the number ofrainbow flags and rainbow motifs on display in all neighborhoods (except for oneneighborhood, Yorkville). However, the pattern of increase fell into two general cate-gories: steady cumulative increase (Roncesvalles, Parkdale, Bellwoods/Trinity/WestQueen West) and unsteady cumulative increase (Queen West, Yonge Street, ChurchGay Neighborhood, and to a lesser degree Liberty Village and Fort York) as shownin Fig. 5.6.The neighborhoodswith steady cumulative increase in rainbowflagdisplay tendedto be small community-oriented neighborhoods with a saturation of small businessesand adjacent residential density, as shown in Fig. 5.7. Neighborhoods with unsteadycumulative increases tended to be business districts populated by chain merchantsand lower residential density. Community, in part is shaped by participation. Activeparticipation by owner-merchants and those with a vested interest in the immediateneighborhoodmay tend to support neighborhood inclusively and diversitymore than,perhaps, a chain store or corporate entity. Regardless, across both categories, thenumber of rainbow flags and use of the rainbow motif increased especially aroundthe summer months (June, July, and August) in which Toronto holds pride cele-brations. The “halo” effect of lingering flags and rainbow decorations seemed toslowly wane following this summer celebration period before being replaced by falland winter holiday decorations. The pattern of increased display of rainbow flagsleading up to, during, and immediately following pride was repeated year after year.However, the prevalence was significantly more hyperbolic in the unsteady cumu-lative increase neighborhoods and much more predictable in the steady cumulativeincrease neighborhoods, which suggests some degree of rainbow washing as thesharp increase in prevalence of rainbow flags is not matched by a likewise increasein persistence of flags over time.The data in this observational study that suggests an explosion of rainbow motifsnear pride month may suggest that outward display of rainbow motif around pridecelebrations has become lucrative for local businesses. Each year more businessesparticipate than the year before. The unsteady cumulative increase group seems tobe bolstered by businesses that commemorate the celebration of pride using the130 A. BittermanFig. 5.6 Prevalence and persistence of rainbow flags/motifs across nine neighborhoods in Toronto,Ontario, Canada. Numbers correspond to neighborhoods shown in Fig. 4 (Source Chart by author)rainbow flag and motif. These business are likely encouraged by an increase in salesrevenues when the rainbow flag is displayed, therefore the display is repeated againthe following year, resulting in a cumulative overall increase. Other businesses seemto follow suit. The aggregate number of rainbow flags on display for this groupincreases steadily over time. This increase over time could be overt and intentional,or it could simply reflect remnant decorations that are forgotten or unintentionallyleft behind. Perhaps well-intended, the tattered remnants of forgotten examples maybe a result of benign neglect, or may be evidence of a rainbow washing effort tosupport business foot traffic,more than an indication of genuine concern forLGBTQ+inclusivity. For example, as the visual display of the rainbowmotif diminishes in theseneighborhoods, the rainbowflags and decorations are often replacedwith decorations5 The Rainbow Connection: A Time-Series … 131Fig. 5.7 Examples of neighborhood andmerchant participation in displaying the rainbowflag/motif(Source Images by author)132 A. Bittermanfor other holidays like Halloween or Christmas.With this sort of use, the rainbow flagand motif become decorations used to celebrate a holiday in an inclusive manner,rather than a symbol of community acceptance, and this rainbow washing couldeventually change the implicit message of the rainbow flag by diluting the codedmeaning of the flag and its significance—safety and inclusion—to LGBTQ+ people.Neighborhoods with steady cumulative increases, in contrast, do not appear to“bump” as much during summer pride months, but instead demonstrate a month-over-month increase in the numbers of rainbow flags on display. Across these neigh-borhoods, rainbow flags are displayed and then remain visible. Rainbow flags inthese cases are not replaced or removed, but augmented by decorations for subse-quent holidays. The aggregate increase over time in the display of rainbow flagsseems to suggest increasing societal acceptance and a desire to denote support forLGBTQ+ individuals year round, rather than only during a specific festival or prideseason (Hinrichs 2020).5.8 Diaspora as Practical IdentityNeighborhood evolution occurs slowlyover time, andneighborhoods are in a constantstate of change (Hess 2019). Undoubtedly, the elements that constitute a gay neigh-borhood are complex and varied. It is impractical to account for an increase ordecrease number of LGBTQ+ residents/visitors to a particular neighborhood (Frisch2021; Spring 2021) and without reliable population and census data more carefullongitudinal research is needed to determine whether or not this is indeed the case(Ornstein andMcCaskell 2017). Therefore, other datamust be examined to determinethe degree to which a neighborhood can be classified as a “gay neighborhood.” Onesimple way to determine whether or not a neighborhood is welcoming to LGBTQ+residents and visitors is the visual prevalence of the rainbow flag/motif. The degreeto which the rainbow flag/motif is displayed, and the persistence of that displaysend a clear message of safety and inclusion for LGBTQ+ individuals. Prevalenceand persistence can take the form of well-intended rainbow washing. In any case,the general direction indicates one toward greater acceptance and inclusion. Anyincrease in the concentration or persistence of rainbow flags is likely a positiveforward trajectory for LGBTQ+ people.Visible signs and changes are one way that neighborhood evolution becomesperceptible (Ghaziani 2021), especially when these signs reappear in concentra-tion or persist with an increasing frequency. The binary descriptors of gay/straightare beginning to be replaced by multipolar—and inclusive—diversity. Because ofthis change, variants of the rainbow flag are used to denote specific constituenciesencompassed by the LGBTQ+ umbrella, but also may references groups not explic-itly included by the LGBTQ+ acronym. As the gay/straight dichotomy becomesless relevant and as descriptors are replaced by an infinitely more inclusive andfluid gay/straight/queer/cis/metro/solo/non-cis/trans/fluid/+ ordinates, the dynamicsof gay neighborhoods and the display of the rainbow flag and its variants will likely5 The Rainbow Connection: A Time-Series … 133change—and have changed—in response. These shifts do not imply that gay neigh-borhoods are waning or dying but signals a positive paradigmatic shift toward inclu-sivity that celebrates and recognizes everyone. Rainbow flags in and around gayneighborhoods will provide visual evidence—an “afterglow”—at the genesis pointsof inclusivity and acceptance (Coffin 2021).As recently as twenty years ago, an increased concentration and persistence ofrainbowflags—a nascent rainbowdiaspora—would not have been as visually evidentin urban districts outside of gay neighborhoods. For example, Roncesvalles, once anethnic Polish neighborhood on the western edge of Toronto, had not been historicallyknown as unusually inclusive, but is now a bustling urban village that is diverse as it iswelcoming. The Roncesvalles neighborhood visually celebrates its Polish and otherethnic heritages along with a newfound celebration of inclusive LGBTQ+ diversityevident by the prevalence of rainbow flags and motif throughout the neighborhood.Similarly, most other neighborhoods assessed seem to be similarly evolving.5.9 Rainbow Proliferation: Synthesis and ConclusionsThe widespread proliferation of the rainbow flag/motif makes now an opportunemoment to critically examine the display of the rainbow flag/motif in relation todemarcating place and as a potential visual indicator of the diffusion of LGBTQ+individuals away from established gay neighborhoods. The scope of this visualassessment study is limited, but the proof of concept offered by the visual assess-mentmethod described in this chapter that tracks the display of the rainbowflag/motifwhich may help illustrate societal undercurrents and population movements or thechange in broader cultural attitudes across urban space. More consistent and reliablecensus and ethnographic data is needed to adequately correlate the movement ofLGBTQ+ individuals to the display of the rainbow flag in neighborhoods outside ofhistorically defined gay neighborhoods.This study also prompts new questions about the role of the rainbow flag insignaling safety and acceptance to a sexual minority group in a post-binary era,which may alter the inherent meaning—and importance—of the rainbow flag.Whilethe prevalence and increasing use of the rainbow flag may signal greater acceptanceof LGBTQ+ individuals, especially in areas of a city outside of defined gay neigh-borhoods (Bitterman 2020a), increasing use may also indicate that the flag risksbecoming “politically correct” window dressing—rainbow washing—and poten-tially less about pride and belonging. Placing the rainbow flag within a broadercontext of place branding can help to more clearly identify the symbolism of the flagas well as provide a structure to assess the proliferation and spread of the rainbowmotif apart from the physical flag itself. Place branding provides one possible meansto contextualize the meaning inherent (Bitterman 2008) in the concentration andpersistence in display of the rainbow flag. These efforts will help to more clearlydelineate between rainbow washing and the use of the flag as a meaningful signal toLGBTQ+ individuals. Careful future study and may also help to accurately predict134 A. Bittermanthe long-term impacts of using the flag to define the limits of gay neighborhoods andto track the movement and settlement of LGBTQ+ individuals or LGBTQ-friendlyareas across a particular city (Hess and Bitterman 2021).5.10 Takeaway MessagesThis visual assessment study produces five takeaway messages:Takeaway Message 1: Concentration of rainbow flags indicates likely presenceof LGBTQ+ individuals.Avisually discernible concentration of rainbow flags and rainbowmotifs suggestsperhaps greater populations of LGBTQ + or LGBTQ-friendly individuals andimplies perhaps a greater awareness and therefore acceptance of LGBTQ+ indi-viduals across a diverse urban environment. Conversely, the lack of visibility doesnot mean that there are no LGBTQ+ areas; but instead, means that planners mustlook more carefully at neighborhood patterns (Doan 2015). Over time, study andtracking use of the rainbow flag/motif will likely correlate with either populationmotility and/or an increasing integration of LGBTQ+ people into neighborhoods,in effect making these neighborhoods “more gay.”Takeaway Message 2: Overall concentration of rainbow flag/motif increasesaround pride celebrations, which may imply rainbow washing.Use of the rainbow flag/motif increases around the time of annual pride cele-brations, which suggests a dilution of the meaning of the flag through well-intended—but nonetheless not fully authentic—rainbow washing. Display of therainbow flag must certainly be beneficial to businesses, especially around pridecelebrations. This relatively new use of rainbow decorations by large chain storesdoes not alone indicate any specific meaning, but is perhaps a strong indicationthat an increasing number of mainstream businesses and shops actively welcomeLGBTQ+ customers.Takeaway Message 3: Over time, use of the rainbow flag seems to be growingand persistent.The persistence and semi-permanence of the rainbow flag and rainbow motifmay suggest specific intention in the display of the flag as a deliberate choice.Some rainbow flags and rainbowmotifs persist well beyond the pride celebrationsthat occurs annually during the mid-summer, and many of these lingering flagsare prominently visible well through the winter holiday season. Persistence of therainbow flag indicates potentially positive attributes for LGBTQ+ individuals andserves as a reminder thatLGBTQ+people “belong”year round andnot only duringpride celebrations. The most notable evidence to support this notion is simply thatrainbow flags and other rainbow symbols are largely absent elsewhere in Torontoat the time of this study, reinforcing a common perception that outward symbols5 The Rainbow Connection: A Time-Series … 135of gay pride—such as the rainbow flag—“belong” to LGBTQ+ people and areused to identify gay or LGBTQ-friendly neighborhoods.TakeawayMessage 4: Rainbow flag concentration and persistence may indicategay neighborhoods that are focused on populations other than gay men.Perhaps more than a symbol of gay neighborhoods that are fracturing anddispersing, the prevalence of the rainbow flag elsewhere in the city may indi-cate other LGBTQ-friendly neighborhoods that are focused on minority popula-tions other than gay men. The rainbow flag could be a visual indicator that thesecommunities are emerging with pride as enclaves for subgroups that are under theLGBTQ+ umbrella, but are not specifically “gay neighborhoods.”Takeaway Message 5: Meaning associated with the rainbow flag is changingover time.The rainbow flag and rainbow motif denote a broad spectrum of attitudes towarddiversity and inclusion that is the cornerstone of gay pride, much as red heartsdenote love near St. Valentine’s Day. However, the historical importance andmeaning of rainbow symbols run deeper in that the rainbow flag—to LGBTQ+individuals—is a coded representation of safe and welcoming space and suggestsa vital sense of belonging. Widespread use of the rainbow flag may suggest on thepositive side greater mainstream acceptance, tolerance, and equality, however,it may also erode the coded meaning of the rainbow flag through overuse orunintentional appropriation. Additionally, some non-LGBTQ+ individuals mayeven interpret the rainbow flag as a broader symbol of inclusion and diversity—social movements they want to support—and not so much as a marker or codedmessage of the gay civil rights movement. In other words, the original targetedmeaning is now eclipsed by broader notions of inclusivity for everyone, not justLGBTQ+ people.SourcesAlbin T (2009) Under the rainbow: Oral histories of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex andqueer people in Kansas.

StoneAbstract The Spanish Town parade is currently the largest Carnival parade in BatonRouge, Louisianawith hundreds of thousands of attendees dressed in pink costuming,cross-dressing, and wearing pink flamingo paraphernalia. This chapter traces thequeer origins of the Spanish Town parade to the racially integrated bohemian gaybor-hood of Spanish Town in the 1980s. Using interviews, archival research, and partic-ipant observation, I argue that current LGBTQ residents of Baton Rouge, even thosewho have never lived in Spanish Town, claim a vicarious citizenship to the neigh-borhood and parade through an understanding of the queer origins of the parade inthe 1980s and the parade’s beginning in a gayborhood. This vicarious citizenshipis tempered by the heterosexualization of the contemporary Spanish Town parade.Although LGBTQ residents still attend the parade in large numbers, there is moreambivalence about the homophobic imagery in the parade and the consumption ofgay culture by heterosexual parade participants.Keywords Spanishtown · Baton Rouge · Carnival · Pride parade6.1 IntroductionSpanish Town, one of the oldest neighborhoods in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is a smallneighborhood built in 1805 by Canary Islanders who had moved from Spanish-ruledGalvez Town (Isch 2016). The Spanish Town neighborhood is not now nor has itever been an ethnic urban enclave and it has had a complex history of racial segrega-tion and integration. During the 1980s, the Spanish Town neighborhood developed areputation as a bohemian neighborhood and gayborhood and began staging a neigh-borhoodMardiGras parade. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ)people were visible in the neighborhood and parade during this time, with the mostvisible participation being from white gay men. The Spanish Town parade is nowthe largest Carnival parade in Baton Rouge, with hundreds of thousands of attendeesA. L.

Stonedressing in pink costuming, cross-dressing, and wearing pink flamingo parapher-nalia. In the 2010s, the event has retained some of its queer cultural influence, evenas it is predominately organized by white heterosexual men.This chapter traces the queer origins of the Spanish Town parade to the raciallyintegrated bohemian gayborhood of Spanish Town in the 1980s. Although there arecompeting accounts of how the parade began, many LGBTQ residents of BatonRouge describe a narrative of the parade as being started by drag queens in a gaybor-hood. I argue that current LGBTQ residents of Baton Rouge, even those who havenever lived in Spanish Town, claim a vicarious citizenship in the neighborhood andparade through an understanding of the queer origins of the parade in the 1980sand the parade’s beginning in a gayborhood. Greene (2014) has defined vicariouscitizenship as “the exercise of rights and entitlements to community participationemanating from extra-neighborhood, symbolic ties to a neighborhood or locality”(99). This vicarious citizenship is tempered by the heterosexualization of the contem-porary Spanish Town parade. Although LGBTQ residents still attend the parade inlarge numbers, there is more ambivalence about the homophobic imagery in theparade and the consumption of gay culture by heterosexual parade participants.6.2 Consuming Gay CultureThe heterosexualization of the parade and neighborhood is related to the largerprocesses of historic preservation and second-wave gentrification in the neighbor-hood, along with tourism and the growing popularity of the parade, the largest MardiGras parade in Baton Rouge. The heterosexualization of previously gay-focusedevents and spaces is connected to a long history of heterosexuals consuming gayculture as a spectacle. This consumption focuses on the aspects of gay culture mosteasily consumed by heterosexual audiences such as aesthetics, camp, and drag (Stone2016).Many scholars study theway the culture ofmarginalized groups is commodified orviewed as a spectacle (Crary 2001; Debord 2012; Wetherell et al. 2001). InGay NewYork, historian Chauncey (1994) describes the way neighborhoods like the BoweryandHarlemwere a spectacle thatwhite,middle-class observerswould derive pleasurefrom visiting. Visitors can engage in “slumming it,” temporarily participating incultural events sponsored by marginalized groups without said visitors challengingtheir own ideas about that culture. Some festival attendees may still be “tourists”visiting “gay Disneyland,” as part of a long history of heterosexuals consuming theexperience of being in gay spaces, particularly gay bar spaces (Heap 2008; Orne2017). Throughout his work, Boystown, Orne (2017) describes how straight womenparticipating in gay spaces disrupts the sexual energy and culture of these spaces, andgay men often resent the intrusion of these women. In more ambiguous gay spaceslike temporary festival spaces, these processes of slumming it or being a touristmay be more obscure. In these temporary spaces “the deliberate consumption ofqueerness” is complex in places “where queerness is performed and visible but where6 Wearing Pink in Fairy Town: The Heterosexualization … 141it is not always evident who is the consumer and who is the consumed, and wherethe consumer regulates production in ways that are difficult to discern” (Rushbrook2002: 198).Conversely, participation in LGBTQ events by heterosexual participants mayincrease a sense of community for all participants. Sociologists have long observedthat when people come together to enjoy something—whether that be a religiousritual, holiday, or festival—it creates a sense of community (Delanty et al. 2011).Browne articulates that “where celebration moves to imagined connections betweenindividuals, there is a sense of collective partying” (Browne 2007: 75). Collec-tive partying may be a “cultural bridging practice” that temporarily brings togetherdiverse individuals for a common purpose (Braunstein et al. 2014). For example,these LGBTQ events with broad heterosexual attendance may also be a temporaryreprieve from heteronormativity for participants and a challenges to internal homo-phobia or transphobia. Heterosexual participants, in studies of drag show and talkshow viewers, often interrogate and challenge their own understandings of genderand sexuality (Gamson 1998; Rupp and Taylor 2015).6.3 Baton Rouge Mardi Gras and the Spanish Town ParadeA common misconception about Mardi Gras is that the festival is a long weekendof debauchery celebrated in New Orleans in which drunk college students displaytheir breasts to get beads and trinkets during parades. Mardi Gras is celebrated allalong the Gulf Coast, fromGalveston, Texas, to Pensacola, Florida, in both cities andrural areas. The festival is a season—the Carnival season—that runs from the dayof Epiphany in January to Fat Tuesday or the beginning of Lent, which is typicallyin early March. Compared to the extravagant tourist spectacle and traditions of NewOrleans Mardi Gras celebrations, Baton Rouge Mardi Gras parades and balls havealways been considerably smaller in size. A network of private organizations calledkrewes run parades and host private balls that are a central part of the local residents’celebrations of the event. The ritual disrobement (or “boobs for beads”) in the FrenchQuarter of New Orleans is the exception rather than the rule for Carnival parades,most of which prohibit such nudity. Most krewe members who ride in parades throwbeads, candy, and toys to all attendees—children and adults.Baton Rouge has a limited history of parading, and none of the parades reach thescale of the popular New Orleans Carnival parades. Few krewes regularly paradedin the city of Baton Rouge until after World War II (Costello 2017). The SpanishTown parade began in 1981 and has since grown into the largest parade in the city.The Society for the Preservation of Lagniappe in Louisiana (SPLL) was founded inthe 1980s to organize the parade and, later, the Spanish Town Ball. The parade grewso quickly that in 1985 it was protested against by Jimmy Swaggart and his ministryfor questionable material (Hall 2016).From the beginning, the parade themes emphasized the bohemian and tacky styleof the parade. The 1982 parade theme was “Everyman a King”, which was both a142 A. L. Stoneplay on Huey P. Long’s slogan for governor in the 1930s and on the ritual inversionof Carnival, in which the peasant becomes “king for the day.” The most infamousthemewas “Poor Taste is Better ThanNoTaste At All” in 1986, the same year that theplastic pink flamingo was adopted as the symbol of the parade. This theme becamethe kitschy placemaking narrative of the neighborhood, as residents embraced thetackiness of pink flamingo decorations on their lawns (Donlon, n.d.). One intervieweein this study who had lived in the neighborhood for several decades stressed that theflamingo became the symbol of the parade because gay Spanish Town residents oftenput them in their front yards.The Spanish Town parade is definitely the largest Carnival parade in Baton Rougehistory. In the 2010s, newspapers consistently report that over 150,000 attendees eachyear crowd the streets in and around the Spanish Town neighborhood to watch floatsand walking krewes depicting political and social satire. Each float or walking kreweis organized by a “krewe,” a term for private organizations that stage Mardi Grasparades and balls (Kinser 1990). These krewes are typically small groups of tento twenty friends in the Spanish Town parade, with comical names like Krewe ofKonfusion, Krewe of Damnifineaux, BeignYAYS, S’Krewe U, and Krewe of MixedNutz. Someone in the group has access to a truck and flat-bed trailer, which is lavishlydecorated with flashy, tacky decor. Krewes throw traditional Mardi Gras beads anddoubloons to the crowd, along with t-shirts, stuffed animals, candy, and items ofdubious value, such as slices of day-old bread, CDs, and beer bottle tops. The entireparade is coordinated by SPLL, which is part of a 501(c)3 non-profit corporationthat has donated over $500,000 to local charities (Hall 2016).6.4 MethodsThe data in this chapter comes from multiple sources. First, studying the SpanishTown parades was one component of a five-year four-city comparative study ofLGBTQ involvement in urban festivals of the South and Southwest, focusing onLGBTQ belonging and cultural citizenship in these four cities. Mardi Gras in BatonRouge andMobile, Alabama, were the two sites in which I studied LGBTQ Carnivalhistory and current events. All data collection—including interviews and participantobservation research—was approved by the Trinity University Institutional ReviewBoard. In Baton Rouge, I attendedmultiple Carnival masque balls, parades, and otherevents, along with Carnival museum exhibits, archives, and academic presentations.Elsewhere I have written about the Krewe of Apollo of Baton Rouge, a Mardi Graskrewe run by gay men who put on an annual Carnival ball that over one thousandpeople attend (Stone, forthcoming).Most of the research for this chapter comes frommy data collection at the SpanishTown events, where I examined both contemporary practices of the parade and askedparticipants questions about the history of the parade and the Spanish Town neigh-borhood. I attended the Spanish Town parade twice (2014 and 2016). At each paradeI arrived early and walked along the hundreds of floats as they were being queued up6 Wearing Pink in Fairy Town: The Heterosexualization … 143before the parade. I took thousands of pictures of the content on the floats, chattedwith float riders, collected ephemera, and took tours of a few floats. During theparade, I experienced the procession from multiple vantage points, including theexclusive judges’ platform and the informal “gay area” and “family area” of theparade. I talked extensively with dozens of parade attendees about why they wereat the parade, how often they came, and what they enjoyed. I met up with membersof the Krewe of Apollo and attended house parties in the homes of gay men wholived in the neighborhood. These activities allowedme to understand the nuances andcomplexity of a large event like the Spanish Town parade. I also attended the SpanishTownBall (2015), and ameetingwith SpanishTownorganizerswhile they painted theflamingo cut-outs for the annual “flocking” (the placement of pinkwooden flamingosin a Baton Rouge lake).This participant observation work was triangulated with interviews and archivalresearch that I conducted in the summer, outside of Carnival season. These inter-views provided important history and context for Spanish Town events. As partof my broader study on Baton Rouge Mardi Gras, I formally interviewed 21 BatonRouge residents involved in localMardi Gras events, three of whomwere involved asorganizers of early Spanish Town events. Almost all LGBTQ interviewees attendedor participated in Spanish Town events in some way. We informally intervieweddozens of Spanish Town Parade and Ball participants. My research assistant and Ispent an evening having dinner with one Spanish Town krewe of lesbian, bisexual,and queer (LBQ) women, and we informally interviewed members of several otherkrewes during Spanish Town events. I also incidentally interviewed a group of whitegay men in Mobile, Alabama, who annually drive to Baton Rouge to be part ofa Spanish Town parade krewe. These interviews, which provided insight into theperceptions and experiences of the Spanish Town parade, were supplemented withhistorical research on the origins of the parade.We collected archival information on Spanish Town from the Baton Rouge PublicLibrary Archives and the Louisiana State University archives. The LSU archivesincluded surveys of the Spanish Town neighborhood in the 1980s by architecturestudent Thomas Chandler.Below, I use Chandler’s study to illustrate the development of the Spanish Townneighborhood as a bohemian gayborhood in the 1980s and the origins of the SpanishTown Parade during this time (see Fig. 6.1). Then, I compare the origins of the paradewith ethnographic impressions during the 2010s.144 A. L. StoneFig. 6.1 Map of Spanish Town parade6.5 The Bohemian 1980s in Spanish TownThe Spanish Town neighborhood has a complex history of racial segregation andintegration as it developed into a bohemian gayborhood. After Spanish Town wasrazed by Union forces in the Civil War, formerly enslaved Black residents lived inthe neighborhood until it was gentrified in the 1930s by white students and staff ofthe newly built Louisiana State University (LSU) campus nearby. Catholic familiesmoved into the neighborhood in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957, the federal governmentconstructed an interstate highway that ran through Baton Rouge and bisected theSpanish Town neighborhood. The plummeting oil market and white flight related toschool desegregation emptied out Spanish Town in the 1970s (Hall 2016). It was inthe 1970s and 1980s that Spanish Town developed a bohemian reputation, a “healthy6 Wearing Pink in Fairy Town: The Heterosexualization … 145wild streak” as gay men flocked to the neighborhood (Hall 2016). One white seniorcitizen man who we interviewed described the residents of the neighborhood in the1970s and 1980s as, in his words, “fruits without money” (in contrast to what hedescribed as the “fruits with money” who live in the neighborhood now).The work of Chandler (1985) set the groundwork for understanding the 1980s inthe Spanish Town neighborhood. Completed in 1985, his study surveyed residents ofthe Spanish Town neighborhood about their sense of neighborhood as place, alongwith interviewing select residents in depth about their homes and neighborhoods.All of the surveys were archived at Louisiana State University, and the interviewswere described in detail in his master’s thesis. The surveys and interviews provideinsight into how residents of Spanish Town in the early 1980s understood their neigh-borhood, along with signs of how the neighborhood had changed into a bohemiangayborhood. Below, I use responses to this survey to capture the feel of the SpanishTown neighborhood in the 1980s.Many residents described theneighborhoodas eclectic anddiverse in their surveys.White married couple Paula and George described their first Mardi Gras in SpanishTown. This couple described the bohemian feel of the Baton Rouge, Louisiana,neighborhood of Spanish Town in the early 1980s, including groups affiliated withthe Spanish Town Parade (the Merry Minstrels and The Sluts of ’84 who dressed indrag). Aftermoving to the neighborhood amonth earlier, they invited a few neighborsover for the parade and their small gathering turned into a large house party:By the end of the day, we had everybody; I mean we had heterosexuals, homosexuals, dragqueens, blacks, whites, people we had never seen before, The Merry Minstrels, The Slutsof ’84, people in ape suits, Superman, dope smokers out on the back balcony…We had areally wonderful time, and even though we didn’t know any of these people—and some ofthem looked pretty shady—everyone was so well behaved. There was not a mar or a scratchanywhere. We had a great time. (Chandler 1985: 47–48)Costuming is common during parades, so people in ape suits, drag, and dressed asSuperman mingled with each other. Like many other residents, Paula emphasizedthe ways that everyone got along despite their diversity.Oneof themost common themes in these surveyswas describing theSpanishTownneighborhood as tolerant in a distinctly bohemian or counter-culturalway.One youngwhitewomanwho lived in Spanish Townwith her young husband and baby describedSpanish Town as “a neighborhood. It is not a subdivision with people buying starterhomes or whatever. People speak to each other on the street and tourists get lost hereregularly” (Chandler 1985: 67). One interviewee of Chandler’s project describedthat the counterculture had been much stronger in the Spanish Town neighborhoodin the 1970s and had kind of quieted down since then, but another Spanish Townresident wrote on their survey that the neighborhood “possesses more people (thanother areas) who still live in a counter-culture type reality—therefore there’s muchmore tolerance, like color” (Chandler 1985: 84). One young single white womanwrote that “Spanish Town is unique! Just on my block, the consistency is: Black,senior citizens, young couples, young singles, students and people like me, not toforget the gays. The amazing thing is that everyone lives and accepts each other”(Chandler 1985: 139). These descriptions of the counterculture in Spanish Town146 A. L. Stoneparallel understandings of bohemian laxity and openness to diversity in other Amer-ican neighborhoods like Greenwich Village, which had a reputation for toleratingnon-conformity, eccentricity, and “artistic types” (Chauncey 1994: 229).Like Greenwich Village, the tolerance for racial diversity was relative to a historyof racial segregation in Baton Rouge and the neighborhood itself and may have beenlimited. Baton Rouge was the site of the first successful bus boycotts in the 1950s,the model for future civil rights boycotts in Montgomery and Tallahassee (Sinclair1998), but it is currently one of the most racially segregated cities in the South(Yee 2015). The neighborhood had gone through a history of being a predominatelySpanish Canary Islander neighborhood, a battleground for the Civil War, a predom-inately Black neighborhood, a gentrified white professional and Catholic familyneighborhood, an abandoned neighborhood, and then a racially integrated bohemianneighborhood. Black residents of Spanish Town in the 1980s may have been awarethat they were living in a neighborhood that at one time had been a predominatelyBlack neighborhood. One Black resident of Spanish Town recalled that before thebuilding of LSU in 1936 a local road used to be called “Slocum Alley” before itwas called University Walk and that Black doctors and professors lived in the neigh-borhood. The racial integration of Spanish Town neighborhood was a conflictualprocess, as many survey respondents described white flight out of the neighborhood.One single white elderly woman who had lived in the neighborhood for 64 yearswrote that “When they started renting to the Negros, some white folks moved out”(Chandler 1985: 103). When the interstate was built through Spanish Town, somesurvey respondents referenced that the small section of the Spanish Town neighbor-hood across the interstate had a larger number of Black residents. Additionally, likeGreenwich Village, Spanish Town may not have been a safe haven for Black gaymen and women. In Chandler’s surveys, few survey respondents reported that Blackgay men and women were visible in the neighborhood.Chandler’s surveys also provide insight into understanding Spanish Town as agayborhood—a neighborhood with a strong visible presence of gay men and lesbianwomen that are often developed out of economically depressed or racially diverseareas of the city (Ghaziani 2015; Hunter 2015; Knopp 1997; Madden and Ruther2015). In Greenwich Village, the ways that bohemians had forsaken social rolesdeemed appropriate for their class and gender often led to thembeing labeled sexuallynonconforming, and gay people “used the openings created by bohemian culture toexpand their public presence” (Chauncey 1994: 235). This bohemian neighborhoodwas the only legible gayborhood in the city of Baton Rouge in the 1980s. Severalolder interviewees told me that nicknames for the neighborhood in the 1980s, suchas “Fairy Town” and “Fairy Ville”, gestured toward the visibility of white gay menin the neighborhood, particularly with the use of “fairy” imagery (Chauncey 1994).Many survey respondents reported on the presence of gaymen in the neighborhoodas more common in the 1980s than in previous decades. Gay men were connectedin these accounts to the gentrification and development of historical conservation inthe neighborhood, which is consistent with a history of gay men as historic preserva-tionists (Fellows 2005). Neighborhood resident Gill described in his interview withChandler that future changes in Spanish Town centered on a growing gay community:6 Wearing Pink in Fairy Town: The Heterosexualization … 147I think the homosexual element is going to stay big. There’s really no better place for themto go. This is established, it’s quiet, they’re accepted, and there are a lot of ‘em. I don’t thinkthey create the kind of up-tightness in the old people that we did ten years ago…the gaypeople interact with the older people and help them cut their lawns and do a little landscapingfor them. A lot of the landlords love ‘em because when they move into a place it can beshambles, and then when they move out it’s beautiful. (Chandler 1985: 85)Gill’s narrative of gay residents in the neighborhood used images of gay men, partic-ularly white gay men, as beautifying neighborhoods through renovation and histor-ical restoration. Their role in beautifying houses that are “shambles” is a key rolethat gay men play in urban gentrification and the creation of areas of historicalpreservation (Brink 2011; Ghaziani 2015; Hunter 2015; Knopp 1997; Lauria andKnopp 1985; Madden and Ruther 2015). Gill’s tone—referring to the “homosexualelement” and usingmild othering language—also suggests that like racial integrationof Spanish Town, the influx of gay men into the neighborhood did not erase historiesof homophobic attitudes in the neighborhood.A few of Chandler’s surveys and interviews hint at the presence of lesbian womenin the Spanish Town neighborhood as well. Chandler’s detailed interviews includedinsights from women who identified as gay in the Spanish Town neighborhood.Shannon, a 30-year-old white divorced woman, wrote in “gay” in the survey as aresponse to a question about race, gender, and marital status. Shannon lamented thatthe neighborhood is “zoned in such a manner so that we cannot vote as a wholecommunity. Thus our strength is diminished on certain issues that effect [sic] ourcommunity” (Chandler 1985: 91). This survey comment suggests that therewas somesolidarity within the neighborhood—possibly based on sexual orientation—but alsoan inability to turn that solidarity into political action.Spanish Town used to be a big drug area. Then I think it turned into a big gay area, but Idon’t think that’s so true anymore. I know there are a lot of gays here, but I wouldn’t call thisa gay garden by any means. There have been a lot of couples and straight people move in. Ididn’t move here just because I’m gay; I moved here because I love the neighborhood. Gaypeople are so transient…. Of the people who stay here awhile, maybe ten to twenty percentare gay; it’s really hard to say. On this street, I would say about fifty percent of the peopleare gay. If there is a lesbian district in Spanish Town, it would probably be around this street.(Chandler 1985: 94)Shannon lives in a section of Spanish Town that she described as “about fifty percent”gay or a “lesbian district” but not a “gay garden.” Yet she also reported that this gaypopulation is transient, possibly renters like many of the neighborhood residents.However, Shannon’s interview provides insight to the presence of lesbian or queerwomen, a potential “lesbian district” on her street in the neighborhood. Lesbian andqueer women territorialize space differently and rarely form distinct urban neighbor-hoods (Brown-Saracino 2019; Gieseking 2013, 2016; Moore 2015). For example,Japonica Brown-Saracino (2019) argues that queer womenmay be more likely to usediverse urban spaces, such as hair salons, coffee houses, and book stores, than gaybars. Lesbians and queer women may not have the economic power and flexibilityto buy houses in gayborhoods (Moore 2015), and also are more likely to live in rural148 A. L. Stoneareas or small towns than gay men (Brown-Saracino 2019). So, the presence of a“lesbian district” in Spanish Town is noteworthy.The culture of this neighborhood was a staging ground for the development ofa wild Mardi Gras parade. The bohemian enthusiasm for eccentricity, artistry, anddiversity coupled with the presence of young white gay men and lesbian womencontributed to the grassroots development of a neighborhood parade that came outof this neighborhood solidarity.6.6 Spanish Town Parades as Part of Gay Cultural Historyin Baton RougeI was walking through the Spanish Town Ball in 2015, a convention center packedwith hundreds of krewemembers in pink clothing dancing to livemusic, drinking, anddisplaying outrageous table decorations including huge light-up penises. I recognizedone of my connections from the Krewe of Apollo, a tall white gay man named Chrisdressed in a pink tutu and went over to say hello. Chris threw shade at my clothingselection—a sports coat with pink stripes and neon green pants—as being too formaland gestured to his own outfit as a better demonstration of what to wear. “This islike a block party, but inside and for everyone,” he told me. He mentioned that hisaunt is here, along with several cousins, because they ride in krewe floats during theparade. I complained briefly that this ball feels so much straighter than the Kreweof Apollo Ball, reflecting my own feelings of discomfort with the décor that seemedto resemble heterosexual bachelor and bachelorette partying with the predominanceof penis imagery. Chris grabbed me by the arm to pull me closer in a moment ofqueer solidary. “Make no mistake,” he said into my ear, “We started all of this.”Chris asserted in this moment that although the Spanish Town Ball and Parade wasnow heavily influenced by heterosexual participants and culture, the parade had beenstarted by members of the LGBTQ community. By bringing me into his declarative“we”, Chris argued that not only gay men but also people like myself—someone heunderstood to be a lesbian or queer woman—were involved in creating these events.Although Chris has never lived in the Spanish Town neighborhood and was a childwhen the Spanish Town Parade started, he asserted vicarious citizenship over theneighborhood and parade. Chris’s symbolic ties to the Spanish Town neighborhoodthrough his gay identity contributed to his feelings of ownership and pride over thestart of the major Mardi Gras event.Throughout my interviews and fieldnotes, I often heard LGBTQ people in BatonRouge describe the Spanish Town Parade as an event with queer origins that cameout of an established gayborhood. There is not a clear documented history of the startof the Spanish Town Parade, and multiple competing narratives exist about how thefirst parade began. Two of these narratives position the origins of the parade withina history of racial integration and contestation within the neighborhood. One whiteheterosexual male interviewee and Spanish Town resident has loudly claimed that he6 Wearing Pink in Fairy Town: The Heterosexualization … 149and a friend started the parade in the early 1980s by paying a few young Black boysto parade around the neighborhood and pound on cardboard boxes for the two yearsbefore the official start of the Spanish Town parade. When the boys did not reappearafter the second year, he got his flat-bed trailer and towed it around the neighborhoodinstead. Other interviewees described that the parade was planned by two “verycreative”whitemen in the neighborhood, one ofwhomwas an anthropologist. Secondline parades are walking parades (e.g., without floats) that are part of the BlackCarnival tradition (Barrios 2010; Stillman and Villmoare 2010). These two menpurportedly watched videos of second line parades in New Orleans to get inspirationfor the Spanish Town parade. They made up the name of SPLL in order to apply fora parade permit. One male interviewee stressed with a positive and respectful tonehow “very creative” these men were in a manner that may have been signaling theirsexual orientation. These two narratives—that the parade was started by two whitemen paying Black boys or by two white men culturally appropriating Black Carnivaltraditions—position white men in the neighborhood as starting the parade traditionby using Black artistry, labor, and cultural traditions.The most common story from White and Black LGBTQ Baton Rouge residentswas that the parade was part of a gay cultural tradition. The Spanish Town Paradecame to my attention that second day I was doing research in Baton Rouge, when Iattended a local Pride festival. I walked among the tables of organizations, chattingwith people at each table about theBatonRougeLGBTQcommunity andMardiGras.While speaking with a young Black lesbian woman who helps run a local group foryoung Black LGBTQ women, she asserted that she was most likely to attend theSpanish Town Parade or the “pink flamingo parade” to support their friends whoride floats in the parade because it was “our parade.” In a phone interview with awhite older lesbian who lived in Spanish Town and who I spotted at almost everyBaton Rouge Mardi Gras event I attended, she exclaimed that “make no mistake,that parade was started by drag queens in a pickup truck.” Many other intervieweesand informants mentioned the presence of drag and drag queens in the parade as animportant part of the gay cultural history of the event.Other studies of the Spanish Town Parade reference the presence of drag queens atthe early parades in the neighborhood. In an interview with a Spanish Town residentwho recalled the 1981 parade, “I looked outmy apartment window [in Spanish Town]because I heard some music. A couple of drag queens and maybe two vehicles wentby [on the street]. I remember thinking what the hell was that?” (Bowman et al.2007: 299). Many interviewees and informants who went to the 1980s Spanish Townparades referenced the visibility of drag queens, including the walking krewe “TheSluts of ’84,” during those years. In a magazine interview, a longtime Spanish Townresident waxed nostalgic about the drag queens in the 1980s parades:Then there were the drag queens; they would show up in, like, black leather and spiked heels,full beards. And we thought they were great, but they dropped out around ‘86 or something.The Advocate [the Los Angeles-based gay magazine, not the Baton Rouge newspaper] feltthat the parade was getting way too heterosexual for them. (Hall 2016)150 A. L. StoneSome informants described these drag queens as not residents of the neighborhood,rather they lived “who knowswhere” and joined in the parade every year. The descrip-tion of these queens—with black leather, spiked heels, and full beards—captures anerotic, amateur style of drag, as professional drag queens rarely sport full beards.Thevisibility of dragqueens in the 1980swas remarkable for several reasons. First,in the 1980s, drag queens had not yet become familiar to mainstream heterosexualaudiences on shows such as RuPaul’s Drag Race. Drag queens were probably onlyfamiliar to attendees of gay bars. Second, the visibility of drag queens in this BatonRougeMardi Gras parade parallels similar efforts in the 1980s in two other cities withCarnival: New Orleans and Rio de Janeiro. Only a few scholars have documentedgay men’s involvement in city-wide Mardi Gras events, and the only two cities withany information on them are New Orleans and Rio de Janeiro. In both of these citiesin the 1970s and 1980s, gay men asserted their right to cross-dress and performdrag during Carnival events, often in defiance of municipal or statewide laws againstcross-dressing (Carey 2006; Green 1999; Smith 2017). Drag played a symbolic rolein the fight for public space and visibility for the gay community in these cities.Third, drag queens became the symbol of gay visibility in the parade, regardless ofwhether or not the queens in question were residents of the neighborhood, rather thanthemostlywhite gay neighborhood residents whowere associatedwith gentrificationand neighborhood beautification. Likemy informantChris from theKrewe ofApollo,these drag queens from outside the neighborhoodmay have been claiming a vicariouscitizenship to the one visible gayborhood in Baton Rouge by showing up and beingvisible in the parade every year.By marking LGBTQ community members as the originators of the parade, infor-mants could also emphasize the cultural and social contributions of the LGBTQcommunity to Baton Rouge history. This unified community contribution may bepart of establishing cultural citizenship and recognition (Lamont 2018;Rosaldo 1994;Stone 2016) or the right to be both different and respected. Drag definitely repre-sents the ways that LGBTQ culture is different; gay respectability politics embracesneighborhood beautification and restorationmore than drag, which is associated withgender non-conformity and queer radicalism.Additionally, narratives of “we started this” may be emphasized by LGBTQ infor-mants, because the queer origins of the Spanish Town parade are not as obviousanymore. In themagazine interview above, the Spanish Town resident decried the endof drag queen participation due to the parade getting “way too heterosexual.” LGBTQBaton Rouge residents attend the Spanish Town parade and also may claim vicariouscitizenship over the origins of the parade. Many informants also described the paradeas run by heterosexual men who don’t live in the Spanish Town neighborhood, alongwith the parade being homophobic and transphobic at times.6 Wearing Pink in Fairy Town: The Heterosexualization … 1516.7 Homophobia and Queer Culture in the ContemporaryParadeIn 2014, the first year I went to the Spanish Town Parade the theme was “FlamingoDynasty”, a play on the Duck Dynasty reality show set in Northern Louisiana andthe controversy over homophobia in the show. A few weeks before the parade, I metthe organizing committee members while helping them paint large wooden cut-outsof flamingoes bright pink for the annual “flocking” event of attaching the cut-outs ofthe flamingos to posts in a Baton Rouge lake. Baton Rouge Carnival had a traditionof people swimming out to steal the cut-outs and display the flamingos in theirhouses or yards. I was surprised at the time that all the Spanish Town organizersthere were white men who were presumably heterosexual in demeanor and self-presentation. They answered my questions about the parade as a fundraiser and howto best approach conducting research at the parade. Chuck, a white man in his sixtieswho managed the fundraising for the group, flirted with me carelessly, even thoughI had been straight forward that I was a queer person studying LGBTQ involvementin the parade. He slipped me a t-shirt from last year’s parade that his krewe hadmade, remarking that he usually made girls show him their boobs for a t-shirt butwinked as he told me that he would let it pass this time. Chuck outlined the spiritand intention of the parade: to raise money for charity, to have a good time, andto have adult-oriented fun. “Children already have Disneyland,” he remarked. “Noteverything has to be for children.” Although children attend the parade, the adult-oriented ethos of the event evoked queer political resistance to children, family,and respectability (Edelman 2004). He confided in me that there was a section ofthe parade route without alcohol but also an area in the heart of the Spanish Townneighborhood where “boobs for beads” ritual disrobement was permitted. There’sa little bit of something for everyone at Spanish Town, and there is also somethingto insult everyone. The Spanish Town Parade is diverse politically and sexually, anethos that was reflected in many interviews and conversations I had throughout myfieldwork in Spanish Town.Yet my interactions with heterosexual organizers of the parade reflect a combi-nation of heteronormativity and participation in queer culture. Jones, a white manin his forties with a bushy beard, regaled me with stories about his costuming andcross-dressing for the event. Traditionally, attendees and parading krewes wear hotpink accessories and clothing, along with flamingo-related gear. Jones commentedthat he had laid out all his pink clothing and realized he had more pink clothes than“a 10-year-old girl.” He told stories about what he described as “bad cross-dressingby straight men” at the parade and ball. The drag he described reminded me of cross-dressing that is done in fraternity hazing rituals and fundraisers. In my notes on theaesthetic of parade goers, I underlined in bold how often I saw “white middle-agedwomen in ponytails with pink tutus”, “bad white frat-boy drag”, and “white oldermen in pink shirts that said ‘This is Your Girlfriend’s Shirt.’” In her work on Prideparades, Katherine Bruce writes about heterosexual attendees of these parades; that152 A. L. Stonethe parades allow even heterosexual attendees an opportunity to flaunt heteronor-mativity and that “they too challenge this code in the world while at the same timeenjoying a rare break from its restrictions” (Bruce 2016: 186). My first impressionis that the Spanish Town Parade is an opportunity for everyone to wear pink and bea little wild, embracing the bohemian spirit of the earlier days of the Spanish Townparade.Touring theSpanishTownfloats before the parade, I noticed that thefloats includedpolitical and social commentary and often scathing satire that was both supportiveand critical of Duck Dynasty. There was just as much homophobic commentary asthere was LGBTQ-supportive commentary. Many floats supported the homophobicattitudes expressed onDuck Dynasty. These floats were dressed up for duck hunting,covered in camouflage, netting, and palm fronds, and exclaimed statements like “It’sjust my opinion!”, in support of Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson’s anti-gaysentiments that led to the discontinuationof the show.Other floatsweremore blatantlyhomophobic, showing the patriarch with a duck call in his mouth stating “The OnlyThing a Man Should Blow is a Duck Call” (Fig. 6.2). Many more floats mockedthe homophobic attitude of Robertson. Over a dozen floats positioned Robertsonas a gay man, a drag queen, or having sex with a male flamingo (Fig. 6.3). Onefloat titled itself Flamingo(phobic) Dynasty and satirized well-known homophobicpoliticians’ statements by replacing their references to gay men to be ones aboutflamingos (Fig. 6.4). I remembered interviewing two LGBTQ members of BatonRouge community—an older white lesbian and a young white transgender man—who abhorred the parade, suggesting it offered up LGBTQ culture as something tobe mocked and allowed straight people to consume gay culture.Walking through the parade floats, I was immediately aware of the limitations ofthe Spanish Town Parade diversity; almost all the floats were occupied by all-whitekrewes. Less than five krewes had Black participants on their floats and these floatshad exclusively Black participants. This kind of racial segregation in Carnival krewesis startlingly common (Gill 1997), but I was surprised to see how dramatic krewesegregation was at an event so frequently described as bohemian and diverse.Several informants described both the parade and the Spanish Town Ball to meas “everyone having their own party next to each other.” The Spanish Town Paradehas grown and changed significantly since its start as a small gayborhood parade.The parade has become a large community event. From my vantage point on thelofty judges’ platform during one parade, I took a shot of the crowd, a sea of tensof thousands of people wearing pink crammed in the narrow streets of the SpanishTown neighborhood (Fig. 6.5). Walking through the streets of the parade while ittook place, I wandered through blocks of families having a barbeque out on thestreet with their kids, corners that were mostly Black parents with young children,a block of mostly white teenagers making out, and a quiet block that included alarge group of white queer senior women. One area in the heart of the Spanish Townneighborhood was blatantly queer, with drag queens, butch lesbians, and other queerpartiers celebrating together. I wandered in and out of house parties being thrown byneighborhood residents. I could not decide whether this collective partying furtheredor lessened the queer visibility of the parade.6 Wearing Pink in Fairy Town: The Heterosexualization … 153Fig. 6.2 Spanish Town float about Duck Dynasty patriarch (Source Image by author)Thequeer politics of the parade at times seems celebratory and at other times seemsa project consumed by heterosexual participants. Elements of the queer origins ofthe parade are evident in the current event, particularly its anti-family sentiment,cross-dressing, flexibility, and diversity. The continuing ethos of “bad taste” at theevent reflects its bohemian origins. Other scholars have suggested that longtime154 A. L. StoneFig. 6.3 Spanish Town float (Source Image by author)parade organizers and participants “argue that the high exposure [of the parade] hassapped the parade of its queer politics” (Bowman et al. 2007: 300). Throughoutmy fieldnotes I did note the consumption of queer culture and fashion by paradeattendees, particularly the attention given to white gay men who were dressed indrag or outrageous costumes. Drag queens who I interviewed remarked that theyoften got frustrated by being constantly stopped by presumed straight attendees totake group pictures with them.The Spanish Town Parade began in a quiet bohemian neighborhood that was theonly visible gayborhood in the city of Baton Rouge. The small, spontaneous paradeof “drag queens in pickup trucks” started in the 1980s and transformed into thelargest parade during Baton Rouge Mardi Gras. The growth and diversity of theSpanish Town Parade may be linked to the same trends as the decline of gaybor-hoods, the emergence of post-gay culture in which sexual identity is less conse-quential (Ghaziani 2015). Instead, I approach the heterosexualization of the SpanishTown Parades as part of a broader trend of the consumption and appropriation ofgay culture, fitting into studies of bars and other LGBTQ spaces that are transformedby the increased involvement of heterosexual participants (Orne 2017). In the caseof the Spanish Town Parade, the increased participation by heterosexuals did notdiminish the vicarious citizenship that LGBTQ residents of Baton Rouge expressedover the origins of the parade. The contemporary parade also still shows signs ofits queer origins and is widely attended by LGBTQ people. However, the Spanish6 Wearing Pink in Fairy Town: The Heterosexualization … 155Fig. 6.4 Spanish Town Flamingophobic Dynasty float (Source Image by author)Town neighborhood and parade have both dramatically changed since the 1980s. GaySpanish Town residents complained to me about how unaffordable the neighborhood156 A. L. StoneFig. 6.5 Street view of Spanish Town parade crowd (Source Image by author)had become as it became trendy and less connected to its bohemian past. Simi-larly, the contemporary Spanish Town Parade includes a complicated mix of homo-phobic sentiments, heterosexual celebration of temporary gender non-conformity,and heterosexual control over the parade organizing.ReferencesBarrios RE (2010) You found us doing this, this is our way: criminalizing second lines, SuperSunday, and habitus in post-Katrina New Orleans.

City dwellers often reason that with supposed improvements in safetyand social mixing, the “gay ghettos” that form a transitional stage in neighborhoodrevitalization should now become common areas. Yet the capitalist logic that drivesthis thinking often trades the physical threat of exclusion or violence for an existentialone, jeopardizing a distinctive culture that remains valuable in the self-realizationprocess of local queer citizens. This is visible not only in changing demographics, butalso in the production of discourse acrossmultiple levels; language and semiotics helpto constitute neighborhoods, but also to conceptualize them. This chapter examineshow public signs and artifacts reify and sustain three competing narratives of a singlecentral Philadelphia neighborhood in flux: the traditionally queer “Gayborhood” thatdeveloped shortly after World War II, the officially designated “Washington SquareWest,” and the realtor-coined, recently gentrifying “Midtown Village.” I argue thatthe naming and describing of these spaces, and how their associated discourses arereflected by their contents, continues to play a role in the ongoing struggle for queeracceptance. Combining observational data of multimodal public texts (storefronts,flyers, street signs, etc.) and critical discourse analysis within the linguistic/semioticlandscapes paradigm, I present a critique of the presumed inevitability of queererasure here. This is supplemented with a comparison of grassroots, bottom-up, andofficial, top-down documents in various media (maps, brochures, websites, socialmedia, etc.) that perpetuate the different discourses. Ultimately, a change in urbanscenery and how a neighborhood is envisioned only masks the fact that spaces ofqueer expression, marked by their eroding distinctiveness rather than their deviance,are still needed.Keywords Philadelphia · Queer identity · Gay neighborhoods · Pink economy ·GentrificationG.

NiedtEvery year in early October, two street fairs take place in Center City Philadelphia,concentrated along the 13th Street corridor: Midtown Fall Festival and OutFest, thecity’s annual celebration of National ComingOut Day onOctober 11th. On occasion,they occur back to back on the same weekend, each drawing thousands of visitors,the Fall Festival on Saturday and OutFest on Sunday. Though they occupy the samegeographic location, the goals of the organizers and nature of the events are quitedifferent. Midtown Fall Festival is an outgrowth of the local business associationand the many boutiques that have recently sprung up on 13th Street. OutFest, bycontrast, arose from the queer community whose social and cultural life has beenstrongly visible in this part of the city for decades (Manley 2014). Depending onwhich day the visitor arrives, what will they perceive: a celebration of the commercialor of queerness? To the untrained eye, either of the two festivals might be seen asrepresentative of the neighborhood, set against a backdrop of buildings and sensorymedia from which a number of discursive arrangements might be extracted.The cityscape itself suggests who and what to expect within the borders of aneighborhood, their sensory and semiotic elements working together to indicate the“proper” occupants. As with other forms of media, when residents see themselvesand their interests well-represented in the buildings, advertisements, objects, andbodies within the space, they will feel welcome, but within the blocks betweenMarket and Pine, Broad and 11th Streets, there are multiple discourses of belongingoperating simultaneously. The commonly used “Gayborhood” moniker is reflectedin the rainbow signs and crosswalks, flyers and murals, and the display of queernessby individuals, especially in the evenings when patrons flock to the local nightclubsand bars. They announce their identity through dress, makeup, and movement, inways that challenge heteronormative patterns of gendered interaction. Neutrally,the city’s “Washington (Square) West” label (as the area lies west of WashingtonSquare) appears in official signage, connected with other neighborhood names thatline the municipal fabric of Philadelphia. And finally, “Midtown Village” appearsin the promotional materials of the stores that constitute it, part of a cosmopolitan,“Globalese” (Jaworski 2015) register that echoes the area’s gentrification. Implicitin that process is the erasure of queerness, putting the discourses into conflict.In this chapter, I examine the case of this neighborhood in terms of how thedifferent discourses that define it are put forward into the cityscape. I provide exam-ples of semiotic texts that are representative of each of the three conceptualizationsof the space, then discuss how they reflect the demographic, social, and economicchanges occurring there. But from a broader perspective, what are the dynamicsbetween the discourses themselves? Can they occupy the same coterminous space?Because their fundamental values are to some degree incommensurable—the repro-ductive logic of capitalism does not mix well with queer liberation, for example—there is little room for compromise. The underlying tension becomes noticeablewhenobserving how adherents of each perspective use discourse and the built environmentitself to try and elevate their take on the neighborhood above the other two.7 A Tale of Three Villages: Contested Discourses … 1617.1 BackgroundThe meanings of a place are contested and contestable over time, as different groupsattempt to center a given collection of streets, blocks, buildings, etc., on their owninterests and history. Massey (1995) points out that place is a social construct, alocative idea that arises from the presence of, and repeated interactions between, thepeoplewhomovewithin it. On the one hand, the efforts to define a place are groundedin a dynamic form of networked politics (Pierce et al. 2011) wherein both materialrealities of capital and the agency of individuals play a role. On the other, place isa discursive concept that is visibly manifest in the landscape, as different forms ofarchitecture, artifacts, and bodies reinforce (or perhaps challenge) a person’s notionsof what “should” be there. As a blanket concept, urban gentrification provides a clearexample of this duality: cycles of rising rents and taxes forcibly alter a neighborhood’sdemographic makeup, changing the visual semiotics of the cityscape and, in turn,how residents and visitors alike conceptualize it. The process is not an instantaneousone, and elements of a neighborhood’s former character almost always peek throughits current façade, providing a point of reference for what Massey calls the “feelingthat there is or has been some kind of disruption between the past of these placesand at least some elements of their present or their potential future” (Massey 1995:183). Trinch and Snajdr (2017) meanwhile demonstrate that a familiarity with, anddeployment of, the textual and visual indicators of previous landscape(s) can betranslated into a kind of local cultural capital. After all, gentrification is partly cast asa struggle for a neighborhood’s “authentic” self, and even those who profit from itssocioeconomic changes recognize the benefit of calling forth the past. But Massey’suse of the word disruption highlights the anger and bitterness that such change oftenengenders; as symbols of the different, often opposed, stages in a neighborhood’slife, elements of the cityscape can summon these emotions forth, too.Individual cases of gentrification are obviously rather different, but within thecase of gay villages, a fairly regular pattern has been established. Marginalized byheteronormative society, queer folks move into “undesirable” neighborhoods, oftensharing the space with others, e.g., artists, who depend on low rents, and in manycases displacing them (There is also a racial component to consider, as many whitequeers have in turn disrupted communities of color [Valentine 2002]). Over time,the cultural reputation of the neighborhood grows beyond its confines, attractingnewcomers who see an opportunity for development; Philadelphia is no exception.It is important to remember that there has not been a concerted effort to expel queerindividuals here, even though the economic realities have driven away many whodo not fall into the white, cisgendered, male, affluent gay archetype (Those who dohave not been directly marginalized, and many of them patronize bars, restaurants,and shops that are not overtly queer in character). But this shifting conception of theneighborhood poses a more existential threat. There is evidence that environmentsrich with examples of alternative sexuality are beneficial to the mental health ofqueer youth struggling to come to terms with who they are (Wienke et al. 2021); to162 G. Niedterode that is to threaten the well-being of this population. Doan and Higgins (2011)describe queer spaces as a “Foucauldian heterotopia” of possibilities and liberatorypolitics, geographic vessels for the first internal, then performed, process of buildingan identity. They further situate the traditional narrative of gentrification in the morerecent logic of branding. This is to say, heteronormative interests will appropriatequeerness (along with other elements) to position themselves as “cosmopolitan,”while ignoring and usually disenfranchising the actual people behind that label.One common narrative casts queer spaces as “ghettos” not worth defending, sincethey keep heterosexuals from meeting and forming positive social ties with queerindividuals. But this confuses integration with assimilation. Ghaziani (2014) pointsout the cognitive dissonance in this kind of “post-gay thinking,” wherein queernessbecomes both obvious and invisible; same-sex couples are praised for marrying andraising children, yet also for not centering their public identity around the very char-acteristic that separates them. What this suggests is that queerness is only acceptablewhen it is suborned to straightness. The threat arises when the vocal queer popula-tion is displaced and scattered, creating what Ghaziani calls a cultural archipelago;despite many same-sex couples’ success in leading heteronormative lives, he equallycitesmany anecdotes of residents forced out bymiddle- or upper-class straight gentri-fication. True gayborhoods where queer identities are celebrated become so-calledgay-friendly spaces that merely tolerate them.7.2 The Space in QuestionFounded in the late seventeenth century on Lenape land, Philadelphia is one ofthe oldest large cities in the USA, playing a prominent role throughout the historyof the nation. It is commonly known as a “city of neighborhoods,” with over onehundred such spaces—notable for a city with not much more than 100 mi2 of built-up land area. The city’s long history has contributed to the development of individualneighborhoods’ firm borders and distinctive character. As a center for immigrationthroughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it has a diverse demographicmakeup, although there are the usual patterns of racial/ethnic and economic segre-gation that one sees in many US cities (Logan 2013). Within that context, the areaconsidered within this chapter lies in one of the more recently affluent corners ofCenter City (the downtown district). After the economic hardships of the 1980s,revitalization projects transformed the neighborhood, pricing out poorer residents—many of them Philadelphians of color—and marketing it as a destination for visitors.In particular, there have been concerted efforts to draw affluent queer visitors intothe local “pink economy” by highlighting a history of tolerance (Ghaziani, 2021).However, Center City is no longer the sole hub of queer life in the city. An influxof mainstream culture is most noticeable along 13th Street, where new restaurantsand jewelry boutiques crowd out the gay bars and adult stores. Yet the Gayborhoodremains a recognizable name to all, and the rainbow street signs, among other semi-otic markers, remind observers where they are. Interwoven with those two sets of7 A Tale of Three Villages: Contested Discourses … 163indicators are the impersonal arrangements of the City’s municipal maps and touristinfrastructure: directional signs to other neighborhoods and landmarks, bike tourpaths, etc.Any one of those discourses could be used to delimit the neighborhood, dependingon the lens through which one was observing the cityscape. They are coterminous,and the signs of each fall off abruptly at the same borders, though the City’s officialmarkers are similar in form and function to their signage in nearby areas. Despitethis, in key ways the discourses are at odds with each other, the tension between themplaying out in the changeable landscape.7.2.1 GayborhoodThe evolution of Center City, particularly the area bounded by Chestnut, Pine, Broad,and 11th Streets, as a queer space has been a long, organic process echoing that inother cities. Manley (2014) links its growth to several factors. First, in the earlytwentieth century, theatres and performance venues multiplied and spilled over intoburlesque and drag shows in local bars, creating a culturewhere the blurring of genderroles was more acceptable. Second, after Prohibition, many bootleggers became barowners while maintaining their links with organized crime. They also understoodthat an establishment with (still criminalized) queer patrons would be less likelyto call on the police. Skiba (2014) further elaborates the development of the area’stawdry reputation thanks to its growing role as a red-light district; the post-Stonewallopening of local bathhouses exacerbated this perception. And while Philadelphia’ssocial mores were not libertine enough for an open queer culture until the liberationmovement of the 1960s, the city’s carnivalesque Mummers’ Parade had since 1901provided a liminal space for men, at least, to acceptably explore alternative genderpractices (Dubin 1996; Leighton 2012). To the last point, the irony is that histori-cally, the majority of the parade’s participants have been cisgendered, heterosexual,white, working-class men—an intersection of identities commonly assumed to behomophobic.Importantly, there is disagreement among researchers about when the neighbor-hood transitioned from being a place for socialization to a residential area. Stein(2004) shows that as the central district became whiter and younger with lowermarriage rates, the concentration of queer residents was a natural consequence, whileManley argues that the change was driven by convenient proximity to the bars andcruising areas. In the early 90s, the term “Gayborhood” firmly replaced “gay ghetto”(Skiba 2014), with its implications of an active, dynamic community rather than oneexisting at the margins. By the time I began going out in the city as a young adult, thename was in common parlance, and semiotic moments discursively indicating thatthis is a queer space were highly visible in the landscape. The more enduring onesremain: posters at the gay bars, the purple newspaper boxes of Philly Gay News,rainbow street signs, etc., as seen in Fig. 7.1. While other areas of the city havegained their own reputations for alternative expressions of queerness (counterpoints164 G. NiedtFig. 7.1 Fixtures around the Gayborhood (Source Images by author)to Center City’s ever-rising cost of housing and predominantly white, cisgenderedpopulation), the central location of the Gayborhood and its institutions has arguablyallowed it to maintain its predominance.7.2.2 Washington Square WestBeyond the boundaries of the Gayborhood “proper,” Washington Square Westextends from Washington Square at 7th Street to Broad Street, between Market andSouth Streets (See Fig. 7.2). The name reflects the city’s supposed role as a neutralarbiter of space, relying solely on geographical cues to define its districts. It turns upas the proper name for the area on GoogleMaps (albeit with slightly different bound-aries). Kromer (2000) describes how this residential area was intended to have manyof the same cityscape embellishments as its ritzy neighbor Society Hill (a.k.a., Wash-ington Square East): brick paving, streetlamps, green space, etc. However, postwarfederal funding ran out before the City could attend to these blocks, opening the pathfor private investment and purchase of abandoned properties. Perhaps this stuntedprogress toward revitalization contributed to impressions of the neighborhood asseedy or rough around the edges, either improved or worsened (depending on one’sview) by the increasingly visible queer population. Regardless, property values havecontinued to increase under the auspices of the Washington Square West HistoricDistrict, theWashingtonSquareWestCivicAssociation, and other groupswith vestedinterest in the area’s success.Mostly, it seems to be realtors who are interested in using the Washington SquareWest moniker (often abbreviated to Washington West or even WashWest). Walkingthrough this space, one is most likely to see the label on For Sale or For Rent signs,as well as on the City’s directional signs, capped by a stylized portrait of GeorgeWashington as a sort of local logo. These subtle markers in the built environmentare noticeable in passing, even among the more glaring evidence of the other twodiscourses operating in the neighborhood. Putting aside the question of whether anarea’s “official” name should be one that is divorced from its social and cultural life7 A Tale of Three Villages: Contested Discourses … 165Fig. 7.2 Map of Washington Square West area (Source Image by author)and history, it functions as a neutral reference point against which other possibleconstructions of the space can be compared.166 G. Niedt7.2.3 Midtown VillageIn the wake of the 2007–2008 recession, the recently formed Midtown VillageMerchants Association (MVMA) saw an opportunity to acquire and redevelopmultiple properties in the neighborhood, an initiative spearheaded by developer TonyGoldman. The group’s promotional materials refer to him as the “catalyst” for “recre-ating [the] neighborhood,” saying that the merchants brought “renewed vitality aftermany years of decline” (MVMA 2018). While there has been no shortage of newbusinesses opening in the neighborhood, some of them owned and operated by queerindividuals, they are noticeably different in contents, character, and clientele. The sexnovelties shop Danny’s, a fixture on 13th street for decades, now sits among quirkyjewelry shops and upscale restaurants. Many nightlife spots that overtly catered toqueer customers, bars like Woody’s and Sisters, have been replaced and/or becomespaces with a mixed crowd, to the consternation of long-time residents and visitors(Owens and Dent 2017; Spikol 2012). Perhaps because of this friction, the MidtownVillage name has not widely caught on outside of the merchants’ own use. Never-theless, the social, cultural, and economic changes wrought by the expansion of thisalternate commercial landscape reverberate beyond the few blocks of the 13th StreetCorridor where the “Village” is focused.Why is it problematic if Midtown Village merchants choose to deploy differentsemiotic tools to index another kind of identity, which attracts a new audience to theirstores? The main issue is the newer arrivals’ sense of entitlement to dictate the normsof the neighborhood. Owens (2019) recounts an encounter with a straight classmatein line at Voyeur (formally known as “Pure,” a prescient name change) who askedif “this [is] where the fags go,” seeing it as indicative of the heteronormative colo-nization of queer space. The overall acceptance of queerness in mainstream cultureis used as an argument for allowing neighborhoods to become more mixed—but thisdoesn’t entail that queer life should be remarkable within their borders (Ghaziani2014). The introduction of heteronormativity means that those who follow it willalso follow its precept that straightness is the default, and preferable to queerness.MVMA’s website declares that its business owners are “open minded” without spec-ifying how they enact that quality, nor mentioning the queer population at all. Andwhile incidents like the one Owens reports are moments in time with personal reper-cussions, they punctuate the ongoing, low-level reminders in the materiality of thebuilt landscape about the encroaching discourse’s presence. Its associations withmainstream capitalism and majoritarian identity stand at odds with queer observerswho are not affluent, cisgendered, and/or white, leading to conflicting ideas of whatthe neighborhood represents.7 A Tale of Three Villages: Contested Discourses … 1677.3 Discursive MomentsThe role of text and image in establishing the layers of affective geographyis well-established in the literature, especially in the foundational texts ofthe linguistic/semiotic landscapes paradigm (See for example Blommaert 2007;Jaworski and Thurlow 2010; Scollon and Scollon 2003; Shohamy et al. 2010). Thecentral idea of the discipline, which draws heavily from spatial production theories byLefebvre, Tuan, and others, is that public texts that form ameaning-filled semioscapeoffer a glimpse into the sociolinguistic and discursive realities of an area. Each artifactgives visibility and adds weight to discourses about a neighborhood, block, intersec-tion, or even smaller units of space. These accumulate into overall impressions aboutthe character of this or that neighborhood. But it is not simply a numerical questionof which discourse has the most signs; occupants who hold different ideologies andbackgrounds will resonate to different degrees with the array of possible discoursesavailable to unpack from a space. For example, the sex shop Danny’s, with queertrappings regularly featured in its front window, can be perceived as either an inte-gral part of the Gayborhood, a taxpaying business at an address located within theofficial Washington West district, or a lurid eyesore among the boutiques that makeup Midtown Village. Meanwhile, the wine bar next door is simultaneously a symbolof unwanted gentrification, another taxpaying business, or a valued member of thegrowing commercial district. The signs that Scollon and Scollon (2003) refer to astransgressivewith respect to a given discourse only become so in the ideological eyeof a given beholder.This chapter’s purpose is not to determine whether conflict exists between resi-dents from one side or another; mass media articles and social media are evidenceenough of those opinions. Instead, I consider here a number of locations and artifactsfrom the neighborhood in terms of how they fit into the competing discourses. Likecertain branches of geography, linguistic landscape researchers commonly employphotography, urban walking, and ethnographic observation to gather data, tools thatfunction as part of a “place-making” process (Pink 2008). The examples presentedherewere documented during photowalks throughout the area; I attempted to capturea wide variety of signs and objects representative from each of the three discourses.There were hundreds of ready examples to photograph on each outing, but with thequalitative slant of the method, volume is less important than semiotic significance.I must also acknowledge that, as a queer resident of the city and a frequent visitor tothe neighborhood in question, my own experience with the space forms a degree ofbias that can only be acknowleged, not erased.168 G. Niedt7.3.1 Snapshots from the GayborhoodThe buildings and physical objects that signify the Gayborhood show a diversitybuilt up over decades. Mainstream emblems, such as the use of rainbows, mix withthe local to create a cityscape that signifies queerness in a number of ways, eachrequiring a different kind of familiarity with the visual language to recognize thetext (Moriarty 2002). For example, the street scene at the top left in Fig. 7.3 showsone of the smaller, colonial-era side streets nestled in the neighborhood, lined withnineteenth-century houses and a bar flying a queered USA flag. The sign for LatimerStreet shows one of the City’s rainbow stripes designating the intersection as partof the Gayborhood, a convergence between the popular and “official” conceptionsof the neighborhood. Compare these more universal markers with the mural in thetop right, found on the site of the former 12th Street Gym less than a block away.The artwork depicts Gloria Casarez, the City’s first director of LGBT Affairs anda leader in the local community, who passed away from cancer in 2014. WhilePhiladelphia is also known as a city of murals, with thousands of them bedeckingwalls across the city, not many of them in the downtown area feature direct portraitsof local, contemporary figures, especially women of color. The fact that the buildingin question was a popular gym for the gay community before its closure in early2018 adds further weight for passerby who have the local knowledge to fully “read”the mural’s significance.The Gayborhood is also characterized by various types of ephemera that circulatein the space: the flyers and posters advertising drag shows and cabarets on the walloutside Franky Bradley’s (a restaurant and bar that occupies the site of former lesbianbar, Sisters), books arranged in front of Giovanni’s Room (now the oldest LGBTbookstore in the USA), the Bud Light banner aimed at a queer clientele outside thedeli on 12th Street. Following McLuhan’s famous dictum that the medium is themessage, Scollon and Scollon (2003) emphasize the importance of multimodalityin accounting for the meanings of various objects and how they are positioned in aspatial discourse. The mobility of these objects suggests, on the one hand, a kind ofimpermanence and fragility; they can easily be removed or blown away. On the otherhand, such media add a sense of dynamism, change and growth to the landscape andare often the province of those who have less capital to express themselves throughpublic signage. Ephemera reflect a more grassroots, performative, and adaptableethos—qualities that have served residents of the Gayborhood well throughout thedecades—but might cause a viewer to assign the discourse they represent less value.Perhaps the temporary nature of these texts and artifacts in the landscape reflectsanother part of what Midtown Village merchants are referring to when they talkabout the neighborhood’s decline. The Gayborhood has always been flamboyant butnot flashy, libertine but not (neo)liberal. And sexuality is undoubtedly part of thediscourse’s makeup, expressed through adult store signage, cheeky wordplay (suchas Woody’s, one of the most popular local bars), and signs like the Club Phillybathhouse logo in Fig. 7.2 (center right). Even though it is tucked away on anotherside street and the masculine silhouette only hints at the building’s purpose, no7 A Tale of Three Villages: Contested Discourses … 169Fig. 7.3 Indicators of the Gayborhood discourse (Source Images by author)170 G. Niedtdoubt even this display is too noticeable a reminder of the area’s past for some ofthe more straitlaced new residents. Yet the discourse of sex is a necessary item ofsemiotic analysis in any landscape, queer or otherwise (Milani 2014), as it dictatesattitudes toward occupants’ presentation of bodies, their performance of gender, andtheir behavior toward each other. The Gayborhood has historically offered freedomfrom the confines of other, heteronormative interaction orders encountered almosteverywhere else. To efface this aspect in the name of commerce or so-called decencywould be a disservice to the generations of queer residents who wanted not to beforced to define themselves by how they were different.7.3.2 The Skeleton of Washington WestSo much of how the Washington West discourse is expressed relies on linkageswith other neighborhoods—geographically, infrastructurally, semiotically. Scollonand Scollon (2003) categorize city signage as infrastructural when it alludes to thefunctional aspect of the city, which is perhaps the most significant portion of thisdiscourse, exemplified by the signs in the top row of Fig. 7.4. The sign on the leftdirects passerby to locations both within and without the neighborhood, a mix ofcultural sites and generalized commercial areas, while the one on the right providesa map with color-coded districts and distances to points of interest for cyclists. Inneither case is the Gayborhood or Midtown Village alluded to, despite the presenceof their semiotic markers near both signs; instead, on the left, the drawing of GeorgeWashington serves as an echo of the neighborhood’s name and the city’s historicalrole. Functional as it is, the sign still carries an allusion to the discourse in which itis emplaced.Signs of this format can also be found throughout the surrounding neighborhoods,creating a recognizable visual language that indexes Philadelphia writ large, andpositioning Washington West as part of that whole. These blocks become uniquenot because of any historical, cultural, or demographic distinction, but solely bytheir geographic differentiation. The materiality of the official signs is also worthnoting, as the durability of signage can be read as an indicator of its provenance andauthority, or at the very least of sufficient economic capital for a high productionvalue. While there are also some signs in the Gayborhood discourse, and rather morein the Midtown Village discourse, that are crafted frommetal, hard plastic, and otherlong-lastingmaterials, theWashingtonWest discourse notably does not feature paperand cloth ephemera. Even objects created by ostensibly independent groups, such asthe Mural Arts program that coordinates a great deal of tourism for Philadelphia’spublic art, or the Historical Society whose blue plaques are crafted from metal, havethe literal weight of the city’s backing. They cannot be torn down or easily defaced,and they are anchored to the landscape; compare this with the wall of flyers on theside of Franky Bradley’s, or the rainbow flags that eventually tatter.One could make the counterargument that signage such as that seen in the bottomrow is durable and alludes to the queer heritage of the neighborhood; the rainbow7 A Tale of Three Villages: Contested Discourses … 171Fig. 7.4 Snapshots from Washington West (Source Images by author)stripes on street signs are a further concession that could not have happened withoutCity Hall’s blessing. Yet subtle multimodal indicators in their construction and inter-pretation matter; “Washington West” is far more prominent on the health centersign than “LGBTQ” and the formal metal-on-brick apartment sign notes that thecommunity is LGBT friendly. It isn’t that these signals are unwelcome or especially172 G. Niedtproblematic, but they are not exactly the active celebration of queer life character-istic of signage aligned with the Gayborhood. The photograph on the right of themiddle row in Fig. 7.3 directly illustrates the disconnect between the two overlappingspatial discourses. Behind the historical marker for the location of the PhiladelphiaSketch Club is a rainbow flag marking the entrance to Tavern on Camac, one of theoldest gay bars in the city; the Venture Inn, which survived nearly a hundred yearsuntil its closure in 2016, lay a bit farther down the street. Yet these do not qualifyfor historical recognition. Perhaps in time, there will be other historical markersthat memorialize the queer past of the neighborhood, integrated into the sanctioneddiscourse of the city, but for now they remain separate, articulated by two differentlogics of expression.7.3.3 Welcome to Midtown VillageLike the Washington West discourse, producers of signage that reflects the MidtownVillage discourse make much ado about their open-mindedness. However, while theCity has made tacit moves toward at least acknowledging the presence of queer-ness, there is little to back up the claim of tolerance by the merchants along 13thStreet. The textual and visual semiotics of the corridor instead reflect the same preoc-cupations with cosmopolitanism and commerce that one sees in other gentrifyingneighborhoods, both in Philadelphia and elsewhere.The images in the top two rows in Fig. 7.5 are representative of what one seesin the storefronts along 13th Street and its immediate environs. On the shop wall inthe top left, the “story” presented draws on conventions that index upscale shopping:vocabulary (“unique,” “a true boutique experience,” “we are passionate,” etc.), the“established in (year)” marker of authenticity, an array of professionally designedfonts. Next to it, the display of an award for “Best Shopping Experience” in thecity begs the question, according to whom? In the middle row, the jewelry store’sname, Bella Turka, provides an example of the deployment of linguistic codes fortheir cosmopolitan meaning rather than their actual content (Curtin 2014). The Ital-ianate name with its connotations of elevated culture is more important than itstranslation; other shops in the district also feature Italian names, as well as Frenchand Japanese. And then there are connections to other trends, such as (in thiscase) the recently reawakened tiki bar craze sweeping the nation. Capitalist over-tones of these semioscapes, bolstered by materiality—the fashion items in Lou Louand Bella Turka’s windows, the bombastic décor of Tiki—are in keeping with theprimary reason for Midtown Village’s existence: generating profit. But they alsoreflect broader trends in the country’s consumer culture as it reflects patterns ofgentrification. Trinch and Snajdr (2017) demonstrate the subtle affective impact ofbusinesses that embrace these semiotic codes; they connote worldliness and aspi-rations of wealth, but lose their connection to the local. For the resident who canafford to live and/or shop on these increasingly expensive blocks, participation in thelife of the neighborhood in accordance with the Midtown Village discourse requires7 A Tale of Three Villages: Contested Discourses … 173Fig. 7.5 Midtown village moments (Source Images by author)174 G. Niedtbeing a homo economicus, contributing to circuits of capital. Implicitly, if one isn’tshopping, dining out, or otherwise purchasing some kind of experience at a premium,then what are they doing there?Images from the business association’s website drive this point home. On the leftof the bottom row in Fig. 7.4 is an official placard declaring that Midtown Village isa “unique enclave of independent, open-minded boutiques, restaurants, and more.”Leaving aside the question of what makes them unique, the word enclave implies thatthey are surrounded by a city that is not independent or open-minded, that they standalone in a gritty wilderness. In one sense, the merchants assessment of differencerings true: on nearby blocks, there is homelessness, drug use, and other issues thatcity downtowns often face. By closing themselves off from their surroundings ratherthan growing organically from the neighborhood, they do not solve any problems,but instead exacerbate the rising cost of living. The fall festival flyer on the bottomright aligns the Village with corporate sponsorship and heteronormative values (a“Kids Corner”) that stand in contrast to the largely self-constructed community ofthe Gayborhood. Extending Edelman’s (2004) proposition that queer individualshave “no future” (in straight terms) because there is no imperative to have childrenand accumulate for them, they are further shut out if they are not able or willing toparticipate in the logic of these spaces. Or perhaps the open-mindedness touted bythese boutiques certainly extends to queer individuals—but only to those who canafford to be there, and who fit the mold of straight expectations.The underlying problemwith “re-vitalization” in any context is its semantic impli-cation that what came before was broken, low-quality, or unappealing, even whenthere is evidence to the contrary. Discursively, the shopkeepers who espouse theMidtown Village name and ethos have to rely on this narrative in order to justifytheir presence and the erasure of the neighborhood’s previous character. An example:one business on 13th Street distributes postcards telling their story, saying that they“helped transform the once-desolate neighborhood into trendy Midtown Village.”While I was not present for the urban decay of the 1980s, I can vividly recall theearly 2000s in this part of Center City, when there was plenty of activity along the13th Street corridor associated with queer spaces. But the desolation referred to inthis piece of media is relative; certainly, in my adolescence, there was a dearth of thekind of fashion boutiques and expensive restaurants that one is liable to find now.Lurking under the surface is the idea that this lack stands in opposition to trendi-ness, and trendiness is beneficial for the neighborhood. In fact, it is beneficial for theowners of successful brick-and-mortar stores who market themselves to visitors, andperhaps for the visitors themselves who want another location to shop. It is beneficialfor homeowners who are financially stable enough to afford the increase in taxes andreap the rewards of higher property values. Yet there isn’t much overlap betweenthese groups and a queer community that is more concerned with socialization andthe development of identity than with accruing material wealth.When it comes to the semiotic landscape, there is one moment that stands out tome as indicative of the neighborhood’s dynamics and the manifestation of tensionbetween these three discourses. At the intersection of 13th and Locust streets, theepicenter of the club scene in the Gayborhood—there are a dozen bars focused on a7 A Tale of Three Villages: Contested Discourses … 175queer clientele within a two-block radius—the City painted rainbow crosswalks onthe asphalt in 2015. A reflection of the stripes underneath street signs in the area,the gesture served as an official acknowledgment of the local demography, even asqueer folks were being priced out of the area: an alignment between WashingtonWest and the Gayborhood. However, in subsequent years, the crosswalks faded intodull, chipped paint, crisscrossed with utility workers’ marks and riddled with tiretracks, becoming more a symbol of decay than lasting support from the City (Boren2018; see also Fig. 7.6).Although one enterprising local individual took it upon himself to freshen upthe paint in time for Outfest 2019 (Shaw 2019), it is difficult not to interpret thiserosion as a reminder of the City’s priorities with regard to the communities in thearea. The former inhabitants who gave it life have been, if not forgotten, then at leastbrushed off in favor of new, moneyed arrivals. While the latter group has no qualmsabout appropriating the cultural cachet of queerness to further their own goals, localbusinesses must adapt to the new economic realities or fade away. Returning tothe example with which I opened this chapter, when the Midtown Village Festivalwas announced on social media this past autumn, this struggle was more directlyon display. Once again deploying the language of globalized cosmopolitanism, theevent’s Facebook page stated that:Fig. 7.6 13th and Locust, before the temporary touch-up work for Outfest 2019 (Source Image byauthor)176 G. NiedtMidtown Village has a collection of unique, independent, entrepreneurial, open-mindedboutiques, restaurants, lofts, and much more. The Midtown Village Fall Festival attractsthousands of visitors in one day to experience a variety of activities including multiplestages of live entertainment, food and beverage sampling, merchant and vendor displays,crafters, children’s activities, and much more!The immediate response from several users included comments like, “WTH is amidtown village? The gayborhood has a fall festival? Cool” and, “That’s the Gaybor-hood, not Midtown Village. Midtown Village is in Wilkes-Barre.” Statements likethese are a bit tongue-in-cheek, but still illustrate locals’ sense that the Fall Festivaland the business association that runs it represent a threat to the geodiscursive identitythey are so familiar with. Note that once again, “open-minded” is the only possibleallusion to queerness in the description of the festival, and the specific mention of“children’s activities” serves as a subtle reminder of heteronormativity. The promo-tional materials associated with the festival also stand in stark contrast to that usedfor Outfest. The Fall Festival’s visual media, presumably collected from previousyears, showed crowds of mostly white, straight families and couples, drinking beerand browsing tables of wares; as shown in Fig. 7.5, they are also not shy about theircorporate sponsorship. Outfest’s photos, on the other hand, are populated by mostlyyoung people with a variety of gender expressions, queer couples, people of differentraces and ethnicities, cheering and waving flags. The former is a demonstration ofcapital; the latter is a celebration of liberated sexuality (Not that Outfest doesn’t alsohave vendors, but they are not the discursive focus of the event).What is clear from these interactions is that the fight for the soul of the neighbor-hood is not yet over, as various interests attempt to have their discourse come out ontop. Is it possible to have these competing ideas of the area coexist? Arguably, no: byits nature, the capitalism represented by Midtown Village must eventually swallowand assimilate all competition, while the queerness represented by the Gayborhoodis theoretically defined by its resistance and refusal to capitulate to those norms. Thetwo have hitherto managed to occupy the same space, with the moderating influ-ence of the City—permits for events, structural boundaries, laws that have to befollowed—somewhere in between. But as prices continue to rise, the significance ofCenter City as a primary nexus of queer socialization in Philadelphia will continueto erode, a process visible in the changing built environment and visual semiotics ofthe area. At some point, there must be a reckoning that will determine the identityof the neighborhood moving forward.7.4 Further DirectionsDense urban areas often prove to be rich sources of data for research, such that it isimpossible for any single paper to fully delve into all their aspects. This one shouldnot be treated as anything but an opening of critical inquiry into the discourse of theGayborhood, one which could lead to a number of other investigations. I list threepossibilities here.7 A Tale of Three Villages: Contested Discourses … 177First, many of the examples given in this paper reflectmy personal experiencewiththe shifting nature of the neighborhood and the anecdotes of friends and colleagues.While the local newspapers and online media give some more weight to the attitudesthat I have encountered as a resident of the city, formal interviews could illuminate theemotional repercussions of the landscape’s evolution. In linguistic landscape studies,pairing interviews with visual data (see for example Garvin 2010; Modan 2008) is acommonmethod for moving from the quantitative counting of signs to the qualitativeanalysis of what they signify to individuals. In the case of the Gayborhood/MidtownVillage, perhaps the best group to interview would be the business owners, to hearmore about their intentions with respect to how they present themselves in the space.Interviews on the street, vox populi style, could also shed some light on the case;simply asking, “What is this neighborhood called?” while within its bounds mightgive some sense of howdeeply each discourse has penetrated thePhiladelphia psyche.There are also points of connection with media, artifacts, landscapes, and othersemiotic moments outside the boundaries of the zone discussed here. For example,do the City’s official signs in other neighborhoods perform a similar discursive role?Another corridor that has been rapidly gentrifying is East PassyunkAvenue, a handfulof blocks to the Gayborhood’s south. As older Italian American occupants are pricedout and new boutiques open along the length of the street, the same concerns havebeen raised as the City re-brands the area to reflect its changes. Along a different axis,how do the processes occurring in other cities, as indicated in this volume, reflectthose taking place in Philadelphia? No two cities and no two neighborhoods will havethe exact same struggle for the right to determine their “meanings,” but parallels doarise. There is a kind of intertextuality—or perhaps interdiscursivity—that enablescomparisons to be made and lessons to be learned from one case to another, allowingproducers and consumers of the landscape alike to understand the semiotic codes atplay. The “globalese” deployed byMidtown Village would have no effect if it did notrecognizably encode wealth and status to those who read it. While I have providedseveral examples of media items and snapshots of the city in this chapter, there arecountless others to discover, though any researcher must be careful not to exhaust aquestion beyond the point at which it has been answered.Finally, examining a single moment in the evolution of the cityscape, even inthe midst of an identity crisis for the neighborhood, is limited to a relatively staticperspective. A more diachronic (and probably extended) study would account notonly for how the Gayborhood reflects current ideologies, but also the past and likelyfutures. Beyond anecdotes like the one provided by Owens above, oral historiesfrom long-term residents are useful for giving context to the historical developmentof a space. They add a personal dimension to the argument that having the freedomto develop one’s minority identity is invaluable, and shed some light on how theevolution of a neighborhood impacts the evolution of attitudes toward the bodies thatoccupy it. Archival research can further reveal when the identities of spaces weredetermined, and how conversations around themunfolded over time.Again, onemustconsider scale: how did the local discourses about space, gender, and sexuality alignor disalign with those at the regional or national level? And how have discourses ofrace, ethnicity, and class at different levels fit in? As a “majority minority” city with178 G. Niedta liberal slant and a historically strong working class, these aspects are all highlyrelevant to the Philadelphia equation.7.5 ConclusionIn this chapter, I have described and given examples of the three discourses circu-lating in the space traditionally ascribed to Philadelphia’s Gayborhood. Each has itssupporters and detractors, and all are visible in the neighborhood through the use ofsemioticmarkers like signage, ephemera, and the construction of the cityscape.Whilethey are predicated on historical and material realities of the city, these discoursesare connected to other proximate ones, both geographically (elsewhere in Philadel-phia) and conceptually (queer spaces in other cities). They help to produce localizedidentities and patterns of interaction, as well as affective ties among residents to thespace itself, its meanings, and each other.I close by stating that ideally, the presence of multiple discourses should not haveto cause friction. As with other instances of gentrification, if new arrivals wouldrespect the preexisting culture and population, this would mitigate (though not fullycounteract) some of the social effects. The problem for the Gayborhood is whenstraight individuals invite themselves in with no interest in queerness beyond how itcan benefit them and their own ways of being, insisting that they know what’s best.Whether this stems from the idea that separate queer space is no longer necessary ora belief that capital is the cure for all ills, the upshot is that their approach is destinedto ruffle feathers among residents who are more or less content with the way thingsare. The stability of a neighborhood depends in part on the comfort its members feelwith the space where they live, work, play, meet, and celebrate. In order for the queerpopulation of Center City to continue to feel at home, their struggle for recognitionand acceptance over the past decades must not be overridden by those for whom ithas no weight. And in the end, it is the responsibility of these new entrepreneursto ensure that what they bring to the table does not diminish a community that hasalready fought to achieve so much.ReferencesBlommaert J (2007) Sociolinguistic scales.

Assessing HowAreas with High Densities of Same-SexCouples Impact the Mental Healthof Sexual Minority and Majority YoungAdultsChris Wienke, Rachel B. Whaley, and Rick BraatzAbstract Neighborhoods with large concentrations of gay men, lesbians, and othersexual minorities have long served as places where sexual minority young adultsfind self-enhancing resources. Yet, it is unclear whether such neighborhood envi-ronments also confer health benefits. Using data from the National LongitudinalStudy of Adolescent Health, we explored the relationship between the proportionof same-sex couples in neighborhoods and the mental health of sexual minorityand majority young adults, controlling for other neighborhood- and individual-level factors. Results indicate that for sexual minorities, neighborhoods with higherpercentages of same-sex couples are associatedwith lower levels of depression symp-toms and higher levels of self-esteem. Conversely, for heterosexuals, there are nodifferences in health outcomes across neighborhood contexts. Taken together, thefindings highlight the importance of striving for neighborhood-level understandingsof sexual minority young adults and their mental health problems.Keywords Mental health · Gay neighborhoods · LGBTQ+ adolescents · HealthoutcomesC.

Wienke et al.8.1 IntroductionGay neighborhoods have been a familiar part of America’s urban landscape sinceat least World War II. Famed examples during this time include New York’s WestVillage and the Castro in San Francisco, though distinct gay districts also surfacedin places like Buffalo, New York; Worcester, Massachusetts; and Columbia, SouthCarolina (Ghaziani 2014). Even today, despite evidence showing that many historicgay neighborhoods are in decline, there are still numerous residential areas across thecountry where gay men, lesbians, and other sexual minorities are disproportionatelyconcentrated, as indicated by the percentage of households headed by same-sexcouples, a measure based on U.S. Census data (Gates and Ost 2004). These includeareas that continue to have businesses and other institutions that specifically caterto sexual minorities, such as bars, bookstores, sex shops, churches, nonprofits, andcommunity centers, as well as areas that may be better characterized as “queer-friendly” (Gorman-Murray and Waitt 2009), in that heterosexuals tend to dominatethe residential and commercial spaces, but sexual minority residents, businesses, andorganizations are generally welcomed in the neighborhood.Like ethnic neighborhoods, residential areas with relatively large concentrationsof sexual minorities can be understood as places where marginalized people findresources, including protection from discrimination, a sense of community, sharedvalues, and opportunities for social support (Carpiano et al. 2011; LeVay and Nonas1995; Green 2003). In ethnic neighborhoods, such resources often have importanthealth benefits, especially for mental health (Yuan 2008). For example, studies havefound that for some ethnic minority groups, living in areas with high concentrationsof people from similar ethnic backgrounds is associatedwith bettermental health and,on somemeasures, better physical health than living in areaswith low concentrations,even when other neighborhood factors are taken into account (Halpern 1993; PickettandWilkinson2008; Stafford et al. 2010). In this chapterwe considerwhether gay andqueer-friendly neighborhoods may have similar health effects for sexual minorities.In general, sexual minorities are more likely to self-report problems with mentalhealth than other men and women (Meyer 2003). This includes internalizing symp-toms, such as depression and low self-esteem (Marshal et al. 2011; Ueno 2010a).The pattern holds not only for persons who identify as sexual minorities, such as gaymen and lesbians, but also for those who report same-sex attractions and/or behaviors(Ueno 2010a, b). Althoughmultiple factors appear to contribute to sexual minorities’poorer mental health (Ueno 2010b), most researchers believe that the stress causedby sexual stigma and prejudice is the biggest factor (Meyers 2003). To the extentthat “minority stress” is the main culprit, it seems plausible that living in areas wheresexual minority people form a sizable portion of the population will mitigate some ofthe effects, not to mention the degree of stress exposure. Although the health conse-quences of these environments may not close the sizable mental health gap that existsbetween sexual minorities and members of the sexual majority, there may in fact behealth benefits to living in areas where sexual minorities are especially numerous.8 Are “Gay” and “Queer-Friendly” Neighborhoods Healthy? … 183This chapter explores this issue with a focus on young adults, comparing themental health of those who live in neighborhoods with relatively high concentrationsof sexual minorities to that of those who live in neighborhoods with relatively lowconcentrations. Further, because many individuals residing in neighborhoods withrelatively high concentrations of sexual minorities are not themselves sexual minori-ties, we also compare the mental health of sexual minority young adults to that oftheir nonminority, heterosexual peers. In each comparison, we use the proportion ofsame-sex couple households as a proxy measure of sexual minority neighborhoodconcentration. Our data come from a nationally representative sample of young menand women, and our analysis controls for both neighborhood- and individual-levelfactors, including those that may influence neighborhood selection.8.2 BackgroundGay Neighborhoods and Minority Coping. Meyer’s (1995, 2003) minority stressperspective, which is an elaboration of social stress theory, provides a useful theo-retical starting point for thinking about how neighborhoods with higher densitiesof sexual minorities might promote or protect the mental health of sexual minorityyoung adults. According to this perspective, individuals who belong to stigmatizedminority groups have unique, chronic stressors in their lives as a result of theirdisadvantaged social status. Meyer (1995) refers to these unique psychosocial stres-sors as “minority stressors” because they are activated when individuals encounterexperiences that reinforce their minority status, including prejudice events, such asdiscrimination and violence, stigma, including expectations of rejection, and theinternalization of negative societal attitudes. The contention is that these stressors,which are experienced over and above the routine stressors that all people encounter,increase the likelihood that minority group members will experience mental healthdisparities. Although Meyer (1995) had self-identified sexual minorities in mindwhen he first proposed this perspective, similar arguments have been used to explainthe poorer psychological well-being observed among persons with same-sex attrac-tions and/or behaviors (Ueno 2010a, b), as well as that of other minority groups,including women, racial-ethnic minorities, and poor people (Amato and Zuo 1992;Kessler and McLeod 1984; Turner and Avison 2003).This perspective also recognizes that minority individuals have a range of uniqueresources available to them thatmay help to alleviate the impact ofminority stressors.Meyer (1995, 2003) uses the term “minority coping” to describe any group-levelresources that are related to a stigmatized group’s ability to establish self-enhancingstructures and values in the face of stigma. As part of the larger social structure, thesegroup-level resources are potentially available to all minority group members, andthus differ from individual-level resources, which vary from person to person (Meyer2003). From this perspective, the residential clustering found among minority groupmembers can be conceptualized as a collective coping mechanism with possiblehealth promoting and protective effects. This may explain why for certain ethnic184 C. Wienke et al.minority groups, areas of high ethnic density are associated with lower rates ofmental health disparities (Halpern 1993; Stafford et al. 2010). It may be that thosewho reside in such areas are better shielded from exposure to minority stressors andhave more resources to cope with stressors.Much of the scholarly literature describing neighborhoods with relatively largesexual minority populations mirrors Meyer’s conceptual framework, with itsemphasis on minority coping. From early ethnographic accounts of gay and lesbianenclaves to more recent work using U.S. Census data on same-sex partner house-holds, the literature almost uniformly describes these types of neighborhood envi-ronments as “safe spaces” for sexual minorities—meaning, places where they canopenly express their sexuality, find refuge from sexual prejudice, and meet and formrelationships with others without fear (Castells 1983; Frye et al. 2008; Ghaziani2014; Hayslett and Kane 2011; Weston 1995). In theory, such spaces allow indi-viduals who feel constrained by heteronormativity, whether because of their sexualbehavior, attractions, or identity, to experience social environments that challenge theheterosexual status quo. This, in turn, should lessen their likelihood of encounteringstigma and other minority stressors. Feeling included and welcome in such spacesalso may offset the sense of isolation and difference that many same-sex attractedpeople face in everyday heteronormative spaces, such as the workplace or school,and may well improve their self-esteem (Finkelstein and Netherland 2005).Neighborhoods with sizable sexual minority populations also offer greater oppor-tunities for members to develop social networks with one another than what might bepossible elsewhere (Finkelstein and Netherland 2005). In turn, these social networksmay provide the kind of social support and solidarity that they need to adequatelycope with exposure to minority stressors (Ueno 2010b). These social connectionsmay be particularly important for sexual minorities who have little or no familysupport, an experience which is not uncommon among young adults with same-sexdesires and/or behaviors (Needman and Austin 2010). For example, in a qualitativestudy of young people living in sexualminority enclaves,many participants describedtheir social networks as substitutes for family relationships (Valentine and Skelton2003). Also, given the relatively large pool of potential same-sex interested partnersin such neighborhoods, young people may have more opportunities than elsewhereto realize sexual desires and to date and connect romantically, conditions which mayprovide additional coping resources (Finkelstein and Netherland 2005).Finally, many neighborhoods with significant gay and lesbian residential concen-tration have amenities and services that either cater to or are tolerant of sexualminori-ties, as well as social events that celebrate sexual diversity (Levay and Nonas 1995).Having these kinds of institutional resources readily available in the neighborhoodmay reinforce a sense of pride and affirmpeople’s non-normative expressions of sexu-ality. Some areas also may have more tangible health resources, including LGBTQhealth programs, queer-friendly counseling and support services, and educationalworkshops on issues related to gay life, including HIV-prevention (Carpiano et al.2011). In short, because of the greater availability of these types of resources, it isplausible that, when all other relevant factors are controlled, young sexual minorities8 Are “Gay” and “Queer-Friendly” Neighborhoods Healthy? … 185living in their areas will report better mental health outcomes than their peers wholive elsewhere.This is not to say that neighborhoods with substantial sexual minority populationspose no health risks to sexual minority young adults. For example, many neigh-borhoods with high densities of sexual minorities also have high levels of sexualorientation-based hate crimes, a finding which raises questions about the level ofsafety in these locations (Stotzer 2010). In fact, the very visibility of sexual minori-ties in neighborhoods may aid perpetrators in identifying victims. Further, residencein these areas may include exposure to subcultural groups that engage in risky behav-iors, including substance use, heavy drinking, and risky sexual behaviors (Buttramand Kurtz 2012; Carpiano et al. 2011; Green 2003; Kelly et al. 2012). In this respect,sexual minority young adults who live in such neighborhoods may be at greater riskof immersing themselves in a subcultural context that promotes risk taking. Finally,as prior studies show, these neighborhoods are places where young sexual minoritiesmay encounter various forms of social exclusion, including by race, class, and gender(Valentine and Skelton 2003). For example, Green’s (2008) research of a gay enclavein New York City suggests that there may be a collective status order in many gayneighborhoods that strongly favors white men, in addition to those who are young,masculine, and middle-class, As a result, women, nonwhites, and other lower statusresidents may be more vulnerable to poor mental health outcomes (Green 2008).Gay Neighborhoods and Heterosexual Residents. Many individuals residing inneighborhoods with high concentrations of sexual minorities are not themselvessexual minorities. In fact, in most instances, nonminority heterosexuals constitutethe majority of the neighborhood population (Carpiano et al. 2011). Further, manyhistorically gay neighborhoods, such as the Castro in San Francisco andWest Holly-wood, California, are undergoing demographic change. Soaring property taxes andrents have driven many sexual minorities out of these areas, while many straightprofessionals and their families have moved in and replaced them (Ghaziani 2014). Itis unclear how these types of environments, if at all, influence the lives of nonminorityheterosexuals.There has been some research on the experiences of straight women in gay-identified venues, such as bars and clubs (Casey 2004; Skeggs 1999). According tothis work, these spaces may benefit women by providing them a measure of protec-tion from “the constant male gaze present in heterosexual space,” which can objectifythem in potentially threatening ways (Skeggs 1999: 225). On the other hand, hetero-sexuals may encounter risks, as they are not always welcomed by gay and lesbianpatrons; nor do they have the same protections and privileges they experience in othercontexts, where heterosexuality is generally assumed and institutionally enforced(Casey 2004). It should also be noted that in historically homophobic societies likethe U.S., at least some straight individuals may feel uncomfortable being in areaswhere sexual minorities are relatively numerous. In short, it may be expected thatfor heterosexual young adults, living in neighborhoods with relatively high concen-trations of sexual minorities will have weak or no effects on their mental health, orpossibly even a negative association.186 C. Wienke et al.8.3 MethodData. The current study uses The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health(Add Health), conducted by the University of North Carolina’s Population Center.The Add Health data rely on a national longitudinal stratified random sample ofadolescents enrolled in school beginning when respondents were in grades 7–12,with the first wave collected in 1995 (Tourangeau and Shin 1999). Subsequent waveswere collected in 1996, 2002, 2008, and 2016–2018. The third wave, collected in2002 when respondents were young adults, provides the dependent measures for ouranalyses. Advantages of this data set include a very large nationally representativesample, which is particularly necessary for this project as it allows for the identifica-tion of a sufficient number of sexual minorities. The data also provide information onneighborhood (i.e., Census tracts) characteristics by linking respondents’ addressesto Census data.The final sample (N = 13,888) used in these analyseswas restricted to respondentswho had valid weights, valid data in the neighborhood characteristics used, and validdata on all of the dependent measures. In the final sample, 13% (f = 1875) ofrespondents are classified as sexual minority young adults, 47% of respondents aremale, 18% are Latino/Hispanic, 21% are non-Hispanic Black, 1% non-HispanicNative American, 7% non-Hispanic Asian American, and about 52% non-HispanicWhite. The average age is 22 years old and ranges from 18 to 28.Dependent Variables. All dependentmeasures are from theWave III data. The firstmental health outcome examined is a measure of “self-esteem.” This 4-item scaleis comprised of items asking respondents how much they agree with the followingstatements as representative of the past 7 days: I have many good qualities, I havea lot to be proud of, I like myself just the way I am, I have been doing things right.Responses on individual items, ranging from 1 = strongly agree to 5 = stronglydisagree, were reverse coded so that higher scores indicate higher levels of self-esteem and then averaged (range: 1–5; M = 4.2, SD = 0.6, α = 0.79). The secondindicator of mental health is an index of “depressive symptoms,” comprised of 9items asking respondents how often certain things were true in the past week (e.g.,couldn’t shake off the blues, felt too tired to do things, felt sad, were bothered bythings that usually don’t bother you, etc.). Responses on individual items, rangingfrom 0= never or rarely to 3=most or all of the time, were averaged (reverse codedwhen necessary) so that higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms(range: 0–3; M = 0.5, SD = 0.4, α = 0.81).Wave I versions of the dependent measures were included in regression modelsto control for initial levels. Including the lagged measures of the dependent variablesmeans that regression coefficients should be interpreted as effects on (or multivariateassociations with) change in self-esteem and depression symptoms.Focal Independent Variables. One of the two main predictors of interest in thisstudy is whether or not respondents are “sexual minority young adults” (SMYA).In the most general sense, a sexual minority is an individual who has experiencewith same-sex sexuality, whether at the level of attraction, behavior, or identity. Theterm reflects the fact that regardless of how one self-identifies, any experience with8 Are “Gay” and “Queer-Friendly” Neighborhoods Healthy? … 187same-sex sexuality violates societal norms prescribing exclusive heterosexuality,thereby making that person a sexual minority (Diamond 2008). For this study, weuse 3 measures of sexual minority status. (1) Respondents can indicate that they self-identify as 100%heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, bisexual, mostly homosexual, or100%homosexual. Respondents answering something other than 100%heterosexualwere classified as SMYA. (2) If respondents were currently involved in or had beeninvolved in a sexual or romantic relationship since Wave II, they were asked the sexof their partner. If the partner was of the same sex, they were classified as SMYA. (3)Respondents were also asked if they had ever been romantically attracted to a male,and separately, to a female. If they answered “yes” in regard to the same sex, theywere classified as SMYA.The other focal predictor for this study is the extent to which respondents live inneighborhoods with a relatively high concentration of sexual minorities. To ascertainthis information, we use a U.S. Census measure of the proportion of same-sex couplehouseholds in a neighborhood (i.e., Census tract). Respondents live in neighborhoodsthat range from0 to 0.19 (19%) same-sex partner headedhouseholds,with the averagerespondent living in a neighborhood that is 0.0058 (SD = 0.008) same-sex partnerheaded households (0.58%). In our sample, 53.1% live in neighborhoods with nosame-sex couple households, 46.9% live in neighborhoods with at least 1% same-sexcouple households (with 38.9% living in tractswith 1%), 8% in neighborhoodswith atleast 2% same-sex couple households (with 6.3% living in tracts with 2%), and 1.7%live in neighborhoods with 3% or more. If these percentages seem low, it is becausewe are using a proxy measure of sexual minority neighborhood concentration. TheCensus does not ask about sexual orientationdirectly, so it leaves out sexualminoritieswithout partners, those who do not live with their partners, and those unwilling toreport living with a same-sex partner. This results in a likely underestimation ofthe proportion of sexual minorities in neighborhoods. On the other hand, accordingto the 2010 Census, same-sex partner households account for just over half of onepercent of all households in the U.S. (Kolko 2012). Thus, even a neighborhood withjust 3% same-sex couple households is nearly 6 times the national average. In fact, aneighborhood with a concentration of sexual minorities of that size would be on parwith other, more researched types of neighborhood concentration, including ethnicconcentration (Spring 2013).Other Neighborhood-Level Predictors. The proportion of same-sex couple house-holds in a neighborhood may be associated with other neighborhood characteristicsthat influence mental health. Thus, we used Census measures to control for othersignificant neighborhood characteristics that may be associated with the proportionof same-sexhouseholds. Followingprecedent (Carpiano et al. 2011),wemeasured therelative concentration of neighborhood economic disadvantage with a “concentrateddisadvantage” index by using a weighted factor score variable based on the propor-tion of the population over age 16 who are unemployed, the proportion receivingpublic assistance, the proportion over age 25 without a high school diploma, and theproportion living below the poverty level. Further, to assess the relative rate of resi-dential turnover, we created the variable “residential instability,” which indicates thepercentage of the population that has moved in the last 5 years. To ease interpretation188 C. Wienke et al.of regression coefficients, we collapsed the percentage of those who had moved intodeciles (1 = 0 to 9.9%, 2 = 10 to 19.9%, etc.). We also included a measure of thepercentage of residents who reside in an urban area (in each tract), collapsed intodeciles.Concurrent Individual-Level Predictors. We also included several Wave IIIindividual-level measures. One variable was the respondents’ relationship status—that is, whether or not they are “currently in a relationship.” Other variables werecreated in lieu of more conventional socioeconomic status variables. As others havenoted (Booth et al. 2012), there are unique challenges involved in measuring thesocioeconomic status of young adults. To crudely capture their financial status, weincluded a dummy coded variable indicating whether or not the respondent receivesany public assistance. To measure economic potential, we included a dummy codedvariable indicating that the respondent attained at least a junior college degree. Wealso include a variable coded 1 if the respondent lives with a parent and 0 if no parentfigure is recorded in the household roster, because while many were independent intheir twenties some were still living with a parent, which could impact mental health.Finally, because we are essentially examining change in self-esteem and depressionsymptoms between adolescence and young adulthood, we include a dummy codedcontrol for whether or not the respondent moved (0) or still lives in the same houseas indicated in Wave I.Other individual-level factors were included simply as demographic controls.These controls include age, sex (dummy coded into Male = 1 if male; Male =0 if female); and a dummy set measuring racial/ethnic identity. Hispanic or Latinoancestry was coded 1 if respondents indicated such and 0 if not; Latino ethnicity tookcoding priority as respondents could identify with any racial group. Most respon-dents identified with one racial group (non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic NativeAmerican, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic White). Those who identified asmulti-racial were subsequently asked which single category best defined them.Selection Factors. We also included several controls for possible selection intoneighborhoods with varying concentrations of same-sex couple households. Specif-ically, we considered factors that may be important in determining whether or notsexual minority young adults choose to reside in neighborhoods with higher densi-ties of other sexual minorities. In our study, young adults aged 18 to 28 may havetransitioned between Wave I and Wave III from a home with a parental figure toone without. Using data from the parent interview at Wave I, we measured whetherthe responding parent was employed or not (1 = employed) and whether or notthe responding parent received any public assistance (1 = received assistance). Ameasure of the frequency of parental alcohol use is included and ranges from 1 “noalcohol use” to 6 “nearly every day.” To tap into parental concerns about their resi-dence, we include the parent’s perception of how crime ridden their neighborhoodwas on a scale of 1 “no problem” to 3 “big problem.” We also include a proxy forfamily of origin’s economic potential that is the average educational attainment ofthe responding parent and their spouse (if no spouse, we used the parent’s educa-tion alone). Parental educational attainment was coded 1 “no formal schooling or8th grade and less” to 6 “professional training beyond 4 year university.” Finally,8 Are “Gay” and “Queer-Friendly” Neighborhoods Healthy? … 189using the youth’s Wave I report, we include a measure of positive parental rela-tionship. This index is the average of three items regarding the how frequently theparent-youth relationship is warm and loving, how satisfied the youth is with the waythey communicate, and their overall satisfaction with the parent-youth relationship.Reverse coded items were scored so that higher scores indicate greater agreement(warmer relationship) where 1 was “strongly disagree” and 5 was “strongly agree.”For most respondents this index taps their relationship with mothers. If data on themother was missing, data on the father-respondent relationship were utilized.We also included a Wave III measure of the incidence of violent victimizations inthe last year, as it may influence residence choice. It is also associatedwith our depen-dent measures (see for example, Meyer 1995; Ueno 2010b). Violent victimization isa summed index of 6 items tapping the number of different incidents experienced,including whether someone pulled a gun on the respondent, someone pulled a knifeon them, someone shot them, someone stabbed them, someone beat them up withoutrobbing them, and someone beat them up and robbed them. Respondents who said“don’t know” to individual items were assigned the mode of no for those items whichmay result in an undercount of victimizations while respondents with missing datawere omitted. The final index ranges from 0 to 6; on average respondents experienced0.13 different incidents (SD = 0.54).Analytical Strategy. Descriptive, bivariate, and regression analyses using OLS(ordinary least squares) are presented. Given the complexity of the data’s samplingmethod, all appropriate sample and individual-level weights are used in all analyses(weights for strata, cluster, and individuals). Stata 13 was used to run the regres-sion analyses. We first estimated equations for the total sample and include a productterm for concentration of same-sex headed households centered at its mean (which isessentially 0) and sexual minority young adult status and all other variables. Subse-quently, we estimated separate equations for sexual minority and sexual majorityyoung adults. To determine if coefficients are significantly different across equationsby SMYA status, we re-estimated equations for the full sample and included productterms for SMYA status and all other variables in the model. Significant product terms(where t values are significantly larger than by chance) indicate that the coefficientsdisplayed in the separate equations are significantly different from each other; thesedifferences are noted in Table 8.3 with bold (p < 0.05) and bolded italicized font (p< 0.01). This method produces results similar to z-tests for the equality of regressioncoefficients across equations (Paternoster et al. 1998). Lagged levels of the outcomemeasures, initial levels during adolescence, are included in the model allowing us tofocus upon change in depression, self-esteem, logged drug use, and logged excessivedrinking.8.4 ResultsTable 8.1 presents the sample characteristics, as well as compares sexual minorityand sexual majority young adults in terms of those characteristics.

Our data shows that SMYA have significantly higherlevels of depressive symptoms and significantly lower levels of self-esteem (seeTable 8.1). The patterns we see when the respondents were in their 20s also appearto have existed in adolescence. SMYA reported significantly higher depression andsignificantly lower self-esteem at Wave 1.In our sample, sexual minority and sexual majority young adults are equally likelyto be in a current relationship (59%), have at least a two-year college degree (19%),and be on public assistance (15% and 13%, respectively). SMYA are less likely thantheir sexualmajority peers to still livewith a parent and aremore likely to havemovedsince Wave I. They are also significantly more likely to live in urban neighborhoodsandneighborhoodswhere there ismore populationmobility butwhere there is slightlyless concentrated disadvantage.In our sample, sexual minority young adults are significantly and substantiallymore likely to be female (70%) than sexual majority young adults (50%). Thisis consistent with other research which shows that young women are more likelythan young men to report same-sex attractions and same-sex behaviors (Diamond2008; Ueno 2010a, b). SMYA report a slightly lower average for positive maternalrelationship. Their parents self-reported slightly higher levels of alcohol use atWave I and levels of educational attainment.

Sexual minorities report a greater increase indepression symptoms and lower self-esteem, net all other variables. The product termfor sexual minority young adult status and proportion same-sex headed householdssuggests a differential effect of the latter for sexual minority and sexual majorityyoung adults in the case of depression symptoms and self-esteem. We explore thisdifference and others in separate equations for sexual minority and sexual majorityyoung adults in Table 8.3.Our primary interest was in the association between the proportion of same-sexheaded households and our 2 outcome measures. As seen in Table 8.3, neighbor-hood concentration of same-sex headed households significantly decreases depres-sive symptoms for sexual minority young adults and significantly increases self-esteem for sexual minority young adults, net adolescent levels of depression andself-esteem and the effects of all other variables. A one unit increase in the propor-tion of households headed by same-sex couples decreases depressive symptoms by3.2 for sexual minority young adults and has no effect for sexual majority youngadults. The difference in these two coefficients is statistically significant (t = 2.22,p < 0.05). A one unit increase in the proportion of households headed by same-sex couples increases self-esteem for sexual minority young adults by 6.1 and isnot significantly related to self-esteem for sexual majority young adults. Again thisdifference across equations is statistically significant according to the full samplemodel with all SMYA interactions included.194 C.

While prior studies have shown that sexual minority young adults experiencepoorer mental health than their sexual majority peers, including higher levels ofinternalizing symptoms, such as depression and low self-esteem (Marshal et al. 2011;Ueno 2010a), our study finds that this relationship may depend on the characteristicsof the neighborhood environments in which they live. Specifically, the proportion ofsame-sex partner households in a neighborhood appears to influence the degree towhich sexual minorities, but not heterosexuals, report poorer mental health, over andabove the influence other neighborhood- and individual-level factors.Our analysis shows that for sexual minority young adults, living in neighborhoodswith higher concentrations of same-sex couples is associated with significantly bettermental health outcomes than living in neighborhoods with lower concentrations ofsame-sex couples. Specifically, we found that those who live in areas with higherdensities of sexual minorities have lower rates of depression symptoms and higherlevels of self-esteem. Conversely, for heterosexual young adults, we found no asso-ciation between the proportion of same-sex couples in a neighborhood and mentalhealth outcomes. Thus, it appears that only sexualminorities are advantaged by livingin neighborhoods where same-sex couples are more densely concentrated.Neighborhood selection factors, such as the respondents’ past experiences withvictimization, their level of parental support, parental perceptions of neighborhoodcrime, and their parents’ financial status, cannot account for the lower rates of depres-sion symptoms and higher rates of self-esteem found among sexual minority young196 C. Wienke et al.adults who live in neighborhoods with heavier concentrations of same-sex couples.Nor can other individual-level factors, such as race-ethnicity, education, or therespondents’ relationship status. This suggest that there is something about the neigh-borhood environment, rather than characteristics of the individuals, that explainswhysexual minorities living in neighborhoods with higher levels of same-sex couplesreport better mental health. Given that we controlled for other neighborhood-levelfactors, including the relative concentration of economic disadvantage, it seems likelythat the presence of other sexual minorities in and of itself is the driving protectivefactor.Why might living in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of same-sexpartner households lead to better mental health outcomes among sexual minorityyoung adults? Although we cannot definitely answer this question based on the dataused in this study, our results are consistent with the assumptions of the minoritystress perspective, with its emphasis on minority coping (Meyer 1995, 2003). Thisperspective asserts that while sexual minorities have unique stressors in their livesas a result of their disadvantaged social status, they also have unique resources tocope with stressors, including potentially protective and health promoting neighbor-hood environments. As is the case in some ethnic minority neighborhoods (Staffordet al. 2010; Yuan 2008), neighborhoods with relatively large concentrations of sexualminorities may function protectively to generate resiliency in the face of minoritystress, with potentially positive consequences for mental health. Sexual minorityyoung adults who live in such neighborhoods may be better shielded from exposureto minority stressors, such as discrimination and violence, and have more resourcesto deal with stressors, such as social and institutional support. The implication isthat sexual minorities who choose to live in neighborhoods with large numbers ofother sexual minorities are not just acting out their personal preferences; they alsomay be seeking the health benefits that these neighborhoods confer (Valentine andSkelton 2003). Then again, even if some sexual minorities choose to live in suchneighborhoods for other reasons, such as economic or cultural, they may still reaphealth benefits by virtue of their proximity.This is not to say that neighborhoods with substantial sexual minority populationspose no health risks to sexualminority young adults. As prior studies have shown, gayand queer-friendly neighborhoods also may be places where young sexual minori-ties may encounter antigay violence, subcultural norms that promote risky behav-iors, including substance use, heavy drinking, and risky sexual behaviors, as wellas various forms of social exclusion, including by race, class, and gender (Buttramand Kurtz 2012; Carpiano et al. 2011; Green 2008; Kelly et al. 2012; Stotzer 2010;Valentine and Skelton 2003).Yet, whatever risks young people may face in thesekinds of neighborhoods, they do not appear to have a negative effect on their levelof depression symptoms or self-esteem. In this regard, the risks of living in areaswith higher than average sexual minority populations do not outweigh the benefits,at least not for sexual minority young adults.8 Are “Gay” and “Queer-Friendly” Neighborhoods Healthy? … 1978.6 Limitations and ConclusionThis study involved several limitations. First, for practical reasons related to dataavailability, we determined the proportion of the neighborhood population that iscomposed of sexual minorities using a census-driven measure of the percentage ofsame-sex partner households. This is a crude proxy that measures sexual minoritypopulation concentration indirectly, as it leaves out sexual minorities without part-ners, those who do not live with their partners, and, as in the case of all surveys,those unwilling to identify themselves. Unfortunately, the Census only collects dataon the residential patterns of same-sex partner households, resulting in a significantunderestimation of the presence of sexual minorities in any given neighborhood.On the other hand, while the Census may not be ideal, the fact that it significantlyunderestimates the extent of sexual minority neighborhood concentration gives usgreater confidence that the neighborhood effects we did find in this study are robust.Second, while our sample included a sizeable number of sexual minority youngadults (n=1875), the subsample living in neighborhoodswith relatively high concen-trations of same-sex partner households was quite small. Small sample size reducesstatistical power and makes it difficult to detect group differences in the popula-tion. Further, sample size limitations precluded us from exploring other potentialvariations among sexual minorities, including by gender, racial-ethnicity, and class.Whenpossible, futurework should consider how sexuality intersectswith other socialstatuses. Studies also need to consider if variations exist among sexual minoritiesdepending on their sexual identity. Not all young people with same-sex attractionsor behaviors adopt a sexual minority identity, such as “gay” or “bisexual,” and theremay be differences in neighborhood effects between those who do and do not.Third, the age range of our sample was restricted to 18- to 28-year-olds. Thus,while the findings presented here may generalize to this particular age group, itremains to be seen whether the same effects will be found in older populations. Wealso dealt with a single age cohort. Neighborhoods with higher concentrations ofsexual minorities may have different effects on different cohorts, including futurecohorts. For example, there is some evidence that historic gay neighborhoods are onthe decline (Ghaziani 2014). If so, this may alter their impact on the mental healthof sexual minorities in the future.Finally, despite our attempts to control for potential selection effects, we cannotbe certain of the causal direction between neighborhood residence andmental health.Although we believe that it is more plausible that neighborhood contexts influ-ence mental health, it is also possible that these associations reflect the selection ofpersons into neighborhoods based on other characteristics related to mental health.For example, with respect to sexual minority young adults, it is possible that healthiersexual minorities are “selected into” neighborhoods with higher densities of same-sex headed households, while their less healthy peers are “selected out.” On the otherhand, the reverse could also be operating, which would have significant implicationsfor thinking about the health effects of high-density sexual minority neighborhoods.While we were able to control for whether the respondents moved between Waves198 C. Wienke et al.I and III, we could not track when Wave III depressive symptoms and self-esteemscores started vis-à-vis the move to the Wave III residence.Despite these limitations, our study provides suggestive evidence that gay andqueer friendly neighborhoods—i.e., residential tracts with relatively large concen-trations of sexual minority residents—have a positive impact on the mental healthof sexual minority young adults, above and beyond the influence of their individualcharacteristics. Our study thus underscores the importance of striving for contex-tual understandings at the neighborhood level of sexual minorities and their mentalhealth problems. Future work should consider exploring the mechanisms underlyingthe protective association between neighborhoods with relatively high concentra-tions of same-sex couples and mental health, and if the mechanisms at work in theseareas are similar to those found in ethnic minority neighborhoods.ReferencesAmato PR, Zuo J (1992) Rural poverty, urban poverty, and psychological well-being.

One way in which location-basedmedia are refiguring previously taken-for-granted spatial traditions is via GPS-enabled online dating and hook-up apps. For sexual minorities, these apps can recon-figure any street, park, bar, or home into a queer space through a potential meetingbetweenmutually attracted individuals, butwhat does this signify for already-existingqueer spaces? This chapter examines how smartphone apps including Grindr, Tinder,and Blued synthesize online queer encounter with offline physical space to create anew hybrid terrain predicated on availability, connection, and encounter. It is also aterrain that can sidestep established gay neighborhoods entirely. I explore how thishybridization impacts on older, physically rooted gay neighborhoods and the role thatthese neighborhoods have traditionally played in brokering social and sexual connec-tion for sexual minorities. Few would deny that location-based apps have come toplay a valuable role in multiplying opportunities for sexual minorities. However, thestratospheric rise of these technologies also provokes questions about their impacton embodied encounter, queer community, and a sense of place. A decade on fromGrindr’s release, this chapter evaluates the impact of location-based media on gayspaces and reflects on what the increasing hybridization of online and offline spacesfor same-sex encounter might mean for queer lives of the future.Keywords Technology · Geography · Hybridization · Space · Location-basedmedia · CoronavirusS.

Miles9.1 IntroductionLet’s go outside (let’s go outside),In the moonshineTake me to the places that I love bestGeorge Michael, Outside (1998)In October 1998, mere months after his arrest for ‘engaging in a lewd sex act’ withanother man in a Los Angeles park, singer George Michael released the hit single‘Outside’, a musical celebration of sex in public. ‘I think I’m done with the sofa/Ithink I’m done with the hall/I think I’m done with the kitchen table, baby’, the singersuggests, before confessing: ‘You see I think about it all the time, 24/7’. The songconcludes with a knowing wink to other cruisers: ‘Keep on funkin’, just keep onfunkin”. As a musical riposte to heteronormativity, the message was clear: queer lifeis best lived outside.Two decades later, queer life is happening rather more inside, and when it comesto gay neighborhoodsmorewidely, things are changing fast. Developments inmobiledigital technologies over the past decade are refiguring previously taken-for-grantedspatial traditions in today’s towns and cities in ways that incorporate online spacesmore than ever before. One way in which this shift is occurring is via online dating,sex, and hook-up apps. The US digital dating app market alone is worth nearly$1 billion (Clement 2020), with disproportionately high LGBTQ subscription: 65%of same-sex couples now meet their partner online rather than in person, against39% of heterosexual couples (Rosenfeld et al. 2019). Location-based media—thatis, products that utilize the GPS location-sensing technologies offered by today’ssmartphones1—now comprise the dominant platform for partner seeking across theglobal North. Male-male offerings including Grindr, Hornet, Scruff, and Blued, andfemale-female platforms including HER and Lex, as well as more mainstream appsincreasingly utilized for same-sex searching such as Tinder and Badoo, have provenpopular for both socialization and sexual encounter (Ahlm 2017; Ferris and Duguay2020; Mearns 2020; Miles 2018).Same-sex partner-seeking platforms, of which Grindr is the (in)famous marketleaderwith users in 234 countriesworldwide (Grindr 2020), have enjoyedparticularlyhigh adoption by gay, bisexual, and other men who seek sex with men. Membershipof these platforms has become the norm not just throughout wealthy cities in NorthAmerica and Europe, but also surprisingly widely around the world, including withinsociopolitical cultures popularly perceived to be sexually conservative (Dasgupta2017; Miao and Chan 2020) and economically marginalized settings in the globalSouth (Birnholtz et al. 2020; Bryan 2019). This rapid and widespread shift to online,smartphone-enabled partner-seeking generates significant implications for offlinegay neighborhoods, compounded by the economic impact of the 2020–21 coron-avirus pandemic on what are, in many cities, already struggling queer commercial1Variously called locative media, Location-Based Social Apps (LBSAs) and People NearbyApplications (PNAs).9 Let’s (not) Go Outside: Grindr, Hybrid Space … 205and community venues. For the LGBTQ app user, Grindr or Scruff or HER canreconfigure any street, park, bar, or home into a queer space by brokering a meetingbetween mutually attracted individuals. What, then, might this signify for already-existing queer spaces? Or to put it another way: what does a gay neighborhood looklike today when any bar can constitute a gay bar for those meeting through location-based platforms? And how might this technologically hybridized route to encountershape gay neighborhoods of the future?For the purpose of this chapter I define hybridization as the layering, synthe-sizing, or collapsing of digital and physical realities. The result is a hybrid reality,landscape, or place, in this scenario for navigation by the dating app user seeking tomake contact with a new partner(s). This chapter calls upon ideas of technologicalhybridization to explore how dating and hook-up apps synthesize online queer spacesof connection with offline, in-person meetings between interested parties—in whatfollows, primarily men, given their disproportionately high subscription to location-based apps.2 I also explore possible impacts of this hybridized encounter on older,physically rooted gay neighborhoods, and I reflect on future scenarios for online andoffline neighborhoods in a post-coronavirus pandemic urban landscape. Few woulddeny that GPS-enabled apps have come to play a significant role in multiplyingopportunities for sexual minorities; however, their unprecedented rise in popularityequally provokes questions about their impact on embodied encounter, communityand a spatially oriented sense of place.When it comes to research, debates percolatingaround online self-presentation in queer technology use are nowwell-established (seefor example Anderson et al. 2018; Bonner-Thompson 2017; Callander et al. 2015;Conner 2019; Miles 2019), but sustained examination of the lived, applied reali-ties for these technology users in a digitally ‘enhanced’ but demonstrably physicalcontext are still relatively limited. This chapter offers just one approach to how wemight think about the changing relations between gay neighborhoods, communities,and mobile technologies.Before going any further, there is a point here that needs to be emphasizedregarding technological change. The location-based media landscape is continu-ally evolving, and industry behemoths such as Grindr and Tinder that dominatetoday may in the near future be replaced by competitors, which will themselves bereplaced over time by yet newer upstart platforms. Technological research is char-acterized by seemingly ever-changing developments, but the wider analyses offeredin this chapter of how contemporary digital platforms impact on gay neighborhoodswill hold true for technologies of the future, much as the patterns I explore here them-selves echo interactions with desktop programs of the 1990s, from Yahoo listservsto Gaydar and PlanetRomeo, seen at the time as pioneering technological offerings(Miles 2018; Mowlabocus 2010). Understanding today’s platforms and how theyfunction for users usefully informs exploration of related (and indeed seeminglyunrelated) technologies of the present and future, even as the products themselves2Though see for example Duguay (2019) for queer women’s’ experiences of ‘scarcity’ in geospatialpartner-seeking.206 S. Mileschange. Indeed, the growing ‘digital turn’ in urban geography (Ash et al. 2018; Barnset al. 2017; Datta 2018; Engin et al. 2020; Kitchin 2014) strongly suggests that tech-nological processes will become ever more dominant in our epistemological andempirical studies of urban life.9.2 Situating Sexualities, Cities, and TechnologiesUnderstandings of space as a conventional cartography have been superseded in thelast quarter-century bymore humanistic and relational interpretations of space as flex-ible, multiple, and continually produced (Harvey 1989; Lefebvre 2004; Thrift 2006).Spaces are also sites of political, cultural and social negotiations and re-negotiationsbetween groups and individuals. The development of these more contested socialconstructions of space have allowed critics to explore the exclusionary spaces andsegregated spaces that have so often characterized queer urban life, from the social—and therefore spatial—primacy granted to heterosexual family life (Edelman 2004)to the red-light zones to which queer life has often been relegated. Excluded or unde-sirable spaces have played host to countless gay neighborhoods, liminal zones, orinformal settlements wherein sexual minorities have built alliances and communi-ties with each other as well as with other marginalized groups (Berlant and Warner1998; Brown 2009; Hartal 2017; Irazábal and Huerta 2016; Orne 2017; Ross andSullivan 2012). The diversifying populations of these gay neighborhoods meant thatthey became ‘centres of community that welcomed “the other”’ (Bitterman 2020:100), whether defined as such by socioeconomic status, ethnicity, class, health, orintersections of these identities. Thus, even as contemporary understandings of the‘gayborhood’ increasingly pivot on capitalist endeavor, exclusionary wealth, andhomonormativity, there exists a queerer history of these same spaces as represen-tative of the physical manifestations of normative hegemonic forces that work todecenter minorities, and by association their practices, in public spaces. Or to put ita different way: even the most commodified present-day gayborhoods have grownfrom more radical roots.Certainly, while cities have constituted—and continue to constitute—spaces ofsexual possibility, they are also sites upon which ‘sexuality is most intensely scru-tinised’ (Hubbard 2011: xiv). Given a history of surveillance, criminalization andhomophobia and transphobia, sexual minorities have long had to negotiate and navi-gate both private and public spaces in complex and often subversive or dissidentways.As chapters elsewhere in this volume demonstrate (Eeckhout et al. 2021; Ghaziani2021; Stone 2021), gay neighborhoods have developed over time as the spatial,generally urban manifestation of networks of sociability and solidarity between non-heterosexuals (Aldrich 2004; Gieseking 2020). Fewwould disagreewith the idea thatthe city holds a particular cachet as a sexually stimulating environment (Bech 1997);within this environment, an historical synchronicity between urban terrain, sex, andsexuality, from cruising to commercial venues, still dominates today (Fig. 9.1).9 Let’s (not) Go Outside: Grindr, Hybrid Space … 207Fig. 9.1 Urban streetscape at night (Source Guillame Jailleton for Unsplash (2017). Used withpermission)To this distinctive history of place-making, technological hybridization has cometo play a growing role in everyday queer life. Technology has become deeply incor-porated into our lived environment. With an estimated 4.4 billion internet usersworldwide (Kemp 2019), the internet has for many become ‘part of everyday lifeand sexuality’ (Johansson 2007: 118), and for many LGBTQ populations, includinga sizeable proportion of gay, bisexual and other MSM, the integration of mobile andcontinuously connected internet into daily life has come to dominate sexuality andsexual practices. In the recent past, virtual worldswere considered distinct from ‘real’spaces, but as technology has progressed in sophistication and portability, hybridiza-tion has developed as a more sustained relationship between the two entities. Tech-nological hybridization challenges the assumption that digital space is predicatedon transcending borders, boundaries, and geography to an ‘Othered’ cyberspace.Instead, it offers an overlaying of physical environments with virtual connectivityand virtual and/or hybrid environments. The relationship between virtual and mate-rial worlds has become so intertwined as to now rarely be conceptualized as separatein any meaningful sense (see Barns et al. 2017; Kitchin and Dodge 2011; Farman2012; Miles 2017). As Robyn Longhurst (2013: 667) argues: ‘people conduct theirpersonal, familial, and emotional lives in a myriad of ways in a variety of differentspaces. Bodies and spaces—cyber and ‘real’—are entangled’. These circulationsgenerate pertinent questions about the way that we practice online life and whatthat looks like embedded in physical experience. Location-based media apps such208 S. Milesas Grindr and Tinder offer a useful case study to witness some of these circulationsin practice.9.3 Location-Based Dating Apps and Their Hybrid QueerSpacesCentral to the growth of digital-physical hybridization is the use of mobile phones,which are now the dominant platform for online connectivity worldwide (Clement2019; O’Dea 2020). Contrary to anxieties raised by scholars including ZygmuntBauman (2003) and Sherry Turkle (2011) regarding the negative implications ofmobile virtual (un)reality on face-to-face communication, the reality borne out bytechnology users’ experiences seems to paint a significantly more relaxed picture.App users tend not to ‘escape’ or stop attending to their physical proximate environ-ment due to their online connection(s); on the contrary, these location-based mediafiguratively overlay a user’s embodied reality with virtual connections with otherpeople and places (see for example De Falco 2019; Gordon and de Souza e Silva2011; Miles 2017; Race 2015).3 If we recognize the ability of the internet as a brokerfor embodied connections, the threat of unintentionally disconnecting from localterritory is neutalized. Space again finds potential as something that can be prac-ticed, imagined, and differently figured for each of its inhabitants, and this equallyimpacts on a physical sense of place. Whether this re-mediation of space and placevia technology holds when it comes to a gay or queer neighborhood is less easilyassumed, not least because ideas of what a gay neighborhood is, and its conceptualparameters, may actually be differently defined by different location-based mediausers, with conflicting attitudes and ambivalences (Miles 2017). Meanwhile, paralleldebates permeate popular contemporarydiscourse: queer dating andhook-up apps arevariously blamed for destroying gay neighborhoods and celebrated for reinvigoratingthem; dismissed as impediments to queer community by some and hypothesized byothers as virtual sites for new and liberatory communities. Talking with users soonreveals that there are as many diverse attitudes to these apps as there are productsthemselves.The major attraction of apps such as Grindr, Hornet, and Blued that dominateonline socialization for male-male encounter is their GPS mapping function. Thisfeature pinpoints a user’s physical coordinates in order to filter potential matchesby proximity, with the aim of expediting localized physical encounters developedfrom online introductions. By displaying a visual grid (Grindr) or shuffled carddeck (Tinder) of potential matches for sex, relationships, and dating ordered bydistance (see Figs. 9.2 and 9.3), these platforms streamline the process ofmeeting andallow the user to filter extensively for desired characteristics in any potential match:3This can hold in reverse, too: today’s smartphones contribute to an embodied experience withinonline space(s) from which they can influence a user’s affective, physical realm.9 Let’s (not) Go Outside: Grindr, Hybrid Space … 209Fig. 9.2 Grindr application (Source Grindr (2020). Used with permission)Fig. 9.3 Tinder application (Source Tinder (2020). Used with permission)210 S. Milesincluding, controversially, ethnicity and HIV status4 (Conner 2019; Lim et al. 2020;Shield 2018). In fact, visiting a town center, new neighborhood, or high street forthe first time and loading the Grindr app makes for a curiously postmodern pasticheof cruising, parsing as it does the likeminded from the uninterested (Miles 2018).But these apps also mark a departure from the spontaneity of traditional ‘analog’cruising. Dating apps allow the user to filter potential matches by age, body type(‘bear’,5 ‘jock’, ‘geek’, ‘mature’), and distance before even an online introduction,let alone a physical encounter. These are algorithmically gifted digital matchmakers,and their filtering abilities are staggering.Queer men have long used subcultural codes, from fashion items like a singleearring or colored handkerchiefs, to language and slang such as Polari, to assist inidentifying each other in public. Now this peer identification is expedited throughdigital algorithms in users’ pockets and executed in real-time. Kane Race (2015:271) captures the distinctive qualities of the spaces created by this location-basedtechnologywhenhe argues that apps are ‘participating in the construction of a specificsphere of sociability and amiable acquaintance among men in urban centers thatprioritizes sex as a principle mechanism for connection and sociability’. Indeed,it is not unreasonable to suggest that these apps influence how users conceive ofurban spaces and how they navigate for social or sexual opportunities in ways thatecho traditional histories of flâneurie or homoerotic cruising in themetropolis (Turner2003;Delany 1999), whether in terms of an initial shared gaze of interest or traversingthe district or neighborhood in search of brief physical sexual contact. By opening upsupposedly ‘straight’ sites for queer encounter, these apps thwart the heteronormativestatus quo that often undergirds public urban space. Even themost intimidating sportsbar can play host to a same-sex encounter, if the 4G reception allows. App users canthus use the technology in their hands to queer dominant norms in ways that can feelnovel and refreshing when outside of established gay neighborhoods.However,while this queer overlay of otherwise heterosexual space is inmanywayswelcome for its capacity for opening up new spaces and places for non-heterosexualencounter, it inevitably lessens the centrality of what were formerly go-to queervenues and neighborhoods. It is certainly worth thinking about ‘how gay men expe-rience the division between dating apps and other online gay venues, and moreover,the division among user groups clustered around different dating apps’ (Wu andWard 2017: 8). It is also pertinent to consider which sexual minorities are most ableto capitalize on the potential of digital platforms for their partner seeking. As recentscholarship demonstrates, lesbian and queerer online partner-seeking networks sufferfrom some of the same marginalization as their physical counterpart spaces (Ferrisand Duguay 2020; Duguay 2019; Murray and Ankerson 2016).4In June 2020, days into U.S. and then international Black Lives Matter protests, Grindr announcedit would be removing its ethnicity filter in all versions of its app (Hern 2020).5Commonly referring to hairier, larger-bodied or more homomasculine men, but subjectively inter-preted; as Yoel Roth (2014: 2122) argues, ‘defining these terms any more precisely than as sexualstereotypes is a task best left to the imaginations of individual users’.9 Let’s (not) Go Outside: Grindr, Hybrid Space … 211In addition to these inequalities, perhaps the yet more urgent need is to get abetter grasp on how app users experience the division between dating apps and offlinevenues.More than their novel disruption of ostensibly heterosexual (and heterosexist)physical spaces with their virtual matchmaking abilities, these apps offer users thechance to find partners without needing to be physically rooted in any kind of gayneighborhood at all. David Harvey’s (1989) theory of time-space compression isusually applied to contemporary global flows, but if we conceptualize the city asa huge space to be processed and queer nightlife, for example, as a ‘portion’ oftime, location-based apps compress the two variables so that from one spot on anight out the app user can survey thousands of meters in radius, and do so in mereseconds. This expert hybridization process not only matches interested partners andexpedites physical meetings but also accelerates external factors in the privatizationof queer space. Now any bar or restaurant can be a site for a first date; any home,hotel, or park can be a site for a sexual encounter. These spaces need not be gay barsor gay neighborhoods or gay saunas, because the obstacle of ascertaining mutualinterest in a potential encounter has already been tackled and successfully overcomevia the online scoping undertaken. Spaces with ‘gay inscriptions, both physical orsymbolic, are not necessarily required’ (Visser 2013: 273). What is generated is asmall gay neighborhood (indeed so small as to be in most cases dyadic, involvingonly (but not always) two people), with an entirely different ‘sense of place’. Weturn now to consider the impact of these impromptu, digitally hybridized spaces onalready-existing gay neighborhoods.9.4 The Ambiguous Impact of Location-Based Mediaon Existing GayborhoodsLocation-based media are by no means the first digital intervention into physicalsame-sex encounter, not least because they echo partner-seeking apparatus popularlyutilized in the 1990s via desktop listservs and static websites. Yet location-basedmedia do seem to capture both the critical and cultural imagination when it comesto considering their impact on the health of gay neighborhoods. We have seen thatdating and hook-up apps combine online queer encounterswith offline physical spaceto synthesize a new hybrid terrain predicated on availability, connection, and eroticencounter. This is also a terrain that can sidestep established gay neighborhoodsentirely. Consequently, the role that these neighborhoods have traditionally playedin brokering social and sexual connection for sexual minorities is nullified. Whatthen might this mean for gay neighborhoods and their value for same-sex encounter?The first thing to consider is that cybersexual encounters are not always corpore-alized. Contact brokered online may stay online (Miles 2019), and there is no reasonwhy these virtual connections cannot be richly fulfilling in and of themselves—emotionally, sexually, platonically, or politically. However, where cybersexual prac-tices are converted to in-person meetings, whether pre-arranged or spontaneously,212 S. Milesapp users are increasingly meeting in private spaces, usually the home (Giraud 2016;Koch and Miles 2020). In the process, they sidestep certain risks generated by same-sex public meeting: anything from being harassed by passersby on a date to beingbothered by police or security staff when cruising in public. Apps also negate thehistorical necessity of visiting queer entertainment venues to find and network withpotential partners. This spatial shift at the hands of locative technology plays intowhat Michael Warner (1999: 153) had previously warned was a wider tendency to a‘politics of privatization’, whereby mainstream social norms operate to restrict queerpublics, either via assimilation to the norm or by pushing these publics out of sightaltogether: in other words, play it ‘straight’ and keep your kinky business at home.Unfortunately, the role of location-based media in compounding this kind of spatialprivatization seems to suggest a capitulation to the heteronormative status quo ratherthan a generative queering of existing exclusionary spaces.What this sidestepping of gay neighborhoods in turn means for the home is alsoworth considering. Private space provides a freedom that is often not tenable inpublic, and this is thrown into yet sharper relief in the context of a global health crisis.The staggering impact of the 2020-21 coronavirus pandemic has hugely restrictedphysical interpersonal interactions (Fig. 9.4), but where encounters have happened,they invariably occur in the private space of home and conversely less than ever inpublic commercial venues, which in many countries were shut down as a result ofthe virus’ spread—in some cases indefinitely. Even physical cruising is reconfigured,Fig. 9.4 UK Government electric billboard campaign, London. Coronavirus: Stay home for yourfamily (2020) (Source Image by author)9 Let’s (not) Go Outside: Grindr, Hybrid Space … 213shifting frommeetings in known physical areas to online introductions and meetingsin the home. The results are mixed: cruising through location-based apps sidestepspotentially embarrassing false starts with non-queer subjects, but it also reducesserendipity (Miles 2018). By making physical meet-ups premeditated, with partnercharacteristics a known (and filtered) quantity, the chance of chance meeting onthe street is drastically reduced. This process engineers out the unpredictability anddiversity of potential street-level encounters in an embodied context. Indeed, whilethe domestication of formerly public encounters invites new forms of queer intimacyin the home, it extirpates the more positive elements of a gay neighborhood—a senseof community, a sense of collective safety, and for some, even a way of life.Clearly, the ongoing diffusion of queer individuals from distinct ‘gay villages’ tomore scattered residential zones, and correlative decreases in LGBTQ commercialand community venues in cities of the global north (Gorman-Murray and Nash 2014;Kanai and Kenttamaa-Squires 2015; Mattson 2019; Podmore 2021; Whittemore andSmart 2016), may be attributable at least in part to location-based media (Collinsand Drinkwater 2016; Gorman-Murray and Nash 2016; Roth 2016). The ability ofdigital technology to facilitate cybersexual encounter, hook-ups, and longer-termrelationships online ab initio certainly seems to contribute to wider processes ofchange—whether displacement, movement, or deconcentration—of queer physicalmeeting-places in many cities of the global North. This is not to say that gay neigh-borhoods exist only to service partner-seeking, given that they perform a wide rangeof holistic and community roles. However, it is to say that partner-seeking is a not-insignificant part of the offering. Collins and Drinkwater (2016: 2) are unequivocalin their assessment that the ‘ubiquity of friend and partner search apps on smart-phones have reduced the demand for, and thus rendered seemingly redundant, mostsmaller gay districts’. Nevertheless, they rightly caution against jumping to conclu-sions or making assumptions about the extent to which these apps are responsible forqueer deconcentration. A more balanced (or ambiguous, depending on one’s ideo-logical position) interpretation is that gay neighborhoods are not declining so muchas shifting and changing, reflecting the organic (and often contested) status of thesespaces more generally (Hess and Bitterman 2021; Doan and Atalay 2021; Ghaziani2015; Hess 2019; Miles 2017; Renninger 2018). Perhaps spatial diffusions of queerculture away from gayborhoods ‘does not signal a destructive de-spatialization butrather a more dynamic series of ongoing re-spatializations across a multitude ofspaces’ (Bitterman 2020: 99). Further, while online sex and dating technologies mayimpact queer commercial venues, wider economic forces are more likely to havedriven these urban changes (see Campkin and Marshall 2017; Lewis 2016; Mattson2019, among others). Nevertheless, location-based technology has undoubtedly hadan impact. As Hubbard et al. (2016: 568) argue:While the significance of new technologies and the profusion of sexual content online caneasily be overstated, there has clearly been something important happening here, with someof the traditional boundaries between private and public, intimate and shared, suburban andurban being inverted.214 S. MilesBecause location-based media allow almost any space to constitute a queer space viatheir ‘plugged-in’ hybrid qualities, the primacy of existing urban venues such as gaybars for queer encounter is reduced. The question then becomes whether the attrac-tion of the aforementioned commercial venues, along with community venues, queerresidential clusters, and gayborhoods more widely is reduced. If technology usersstop occupying these spaces (as restrictive or ‘homonormative’6 as such spaces maybe) in favor of online or private physical spaces, these queer spacesmay diminish. Forgay neighborhoods already undergoing deconcentration, the combination of neolib-eral gentrification, acute economic shocks, location-based technology—and now thecoronavirus pandemic—may foment a perfect storm for unmitigated decline. Withit may well come the loss of more-than-concrete queer publics.9.5 Conclusion: Space for Co-Existence?The exploration of contemporary digital media in this chapter is undertaken in thehope of providing more widely transferable ideas about spaces, communities, andtechnologies, and how these interact when it comes to gay neighborhoods in the nearand more distant future. By better understanding the impact of location-based mediaon space and embodiment, we canmake valuable inferences about a range of sexuali-ties, practices, andurban environments. This chapter has exploredhow location-basedtechnologies specifically impact queer male social and sexual encounters and queerphysical spaces. It has argued that rather than displacing physical gay neighborhoodsin a straightforward way, digital technologies hybridize online and offline encoun-ters, imbuing any given physical locale with a potential queer connection while at thesame time decentralizing the primacy of older, established gay neighborhoods. In thisprocess, questions that arise about the centrality and durability of gay neighborhoodsare valuable and deserve consideration. It may be true that for George Michael andothers, it was the broadly defined ‘outside’—of the house, of the workplace, even of‘the closet’—that offered the best freedom for gay expression (and indeed gay sex),but many decades of community building, queer commerce, and in some cities evenurban planning have helped to develop physically defined gay neighborhoods witha wealth of attractions and minority protections. The loss of these hard-fought for,hard-won places and spaces seem inconceivable.Yet looking forward, might there be space for partner-seeking apps and traditionalgay neighborhoods? If so, success seems based on a conceptual shift from physicalspace as the de rigueur site for sexual encounter to somethingmore of a holistic envi-ronment of safety and community. Certainly, case studies in a range of different citiessuggest that gay neighborhoods are in flux, but that the outcomes need not be nega-tively assumed (Eeckhout et al. 2021; Ghaziani 2021; Coffin 2021; Podmore 2021).If today represents a ‘transitional stage toward a post-gay, post-binary-identity era’6‘Homonormativity’ Duggan (2003) describes a depoliticized gay culture that valorizes domesticityand consumption, in the process sustaining heterosexual dominance in society.9 Let’s (not) Go Outside: Grindr, Hybrid Space … 215(Hess 2019: 230), that is not to say that gayborhoods, however they are manifested,will not retain relevance as sites for community and safety for years to come—justthat how they are manifested remains up for debate.Relatedly, in the same way that paying greater attention to the formation of inner-city neighborhoods beyond the gay village which are increasingly associated withLGBTQ populations proves generative (Podmore 2021), appreciating and exploringthe hybrid bricolage of online and offline queer life separate to its potential negativeimpact on bricks and mortar is also generative. For example, London’s Soho, withits long history of vice and permissiveness (Andersson 2009) historically functionedas the UK’s pre-eminent gay district, as a place in which gay identities are narratedand performed. Yet its booming tourism and rapidly rising property costs as a conse-quence of lucrative real-estate investment have diluted its queer presence in recentdecades. Interviews with app users in Soho find that the cultural capital of a histori-cally queer urban environment like Soho is conceptualized as a symbolic space of thepast rather than a lived reality for many app users choosing to meet partners in localvenues, ‘straight’ venues, or in their own homes (Miles 2017). This shift is reflectedstateside, by Jen Jack Gieseking’s study of lesbian and queer New York City (2020)and by Amy Stone’s (2020) case study of the heterosexualization of Baton Rouge’sSpanishtown, where consumption of historically gay culture by heterosexual paradeparticipants generates an ambivalence about the space for LGBTQ citizens even asthey participate in its festivities. In London’s Soho, app users’ emotional (and erotic)attachment to gay neighborhoods has not necessarily diminished so much as shiftedinto a space of queer social opportunities, and more ambivalently received inter-national tourism (Miles 2017); yet in the faltering economic and touristic recoverywrought by the 2020–21 coronavirus pandemic, this shift may not be a bad thing.Meanwhile, Renninger (2018: 1737) finds that while app users seem cognizant ofspace and place in their app-facilitated encounters, ‘the use of these apps createsan attitude toward space that does not unblinkingly equate Grindr’s purpose withthose of gay bars (and gayborhoods)’. Such a position suggests that apps such asGrindr overlap in purpose with these physical spaces, but not overwhelmingly so.There may therefore be space for both to exist in combination. Finally, Collins andDrinkwater (2016: 11) predict that ‘sexual and social community will, in effect,primarily reside in the online world but physically occupy mainstream social spaceswhenever required’, but that occupation of mainstream social spaces may itself beimbuedwith awelcome queerness. These scenarios demonstrate hybrid potentialitiesfor gay neighborhoods that may look and feel different to what has come before, yethave much to offer queer technology users and non-users alike.There may be also room for a reconceptualization of what constitutes publicspace for app users. A conceptual shift seems to be occurring that moves gay andbisexual public spaces to domestic spaces of home, ostensibly at the hands of popularlocation-based apps that expedite and privatize the social or sexual encounter (Kochand Miles 2020). But perhaps we can rethink the encounters brokered by location-based media as not necessarily ‘private’ and not a wholesale rejection of ‘public’, butrather as a mixing of the two spheres. Public and private are not, after all, absolutecategories (see Blunt and Sheringham 2019; Sheller and Urry 2003). In the sameway216 S. Milesthat Ghaziani (2021: 87) challenges claims that ‘gayborhoods as an urban form areoutmoded or obsolete’, I would argue that by thinking more flexibly about howhomes operate as spaces for queer encounter, hybridization can be conceptualizedas a process that synthesizes not just digital and physical realms but also publicand private spaces, recognizing in the process the increasingly blurred boundariesbetween these previously oppositional planes. Who is to say that the private homecannot constitute a gay neighborhood of sorts? It may be rather different from SanFrancisco’sMissionDistrict orMadrid’s Chueca barrio, but that is not to say it cannotoffer its own attractions.Finally, we might think more flexibly about a post-gayborhood world. In a globalcontext in which whole societies are still reeling from the impact of the coronaviruspandemic, the idea of gay neighborhoods as ‘post-places’ (Coffin 2021) feels posi-tively funereal, but as Coffin argues (Coffin 2021: 373), ‘individuals and collectivesmay still be inspired by the memories, representations, and imaginaries previouslyprovided by these erstwhile places.’ We are still absorbing the full impact of coro-navirus on queer communities and on commercial venues which depend on closecontact, in-person interaction and intimate socializing, but it may well prove to bethe case that the ‘scene’ in many cities remains either temporarily or permanentlymuted. In such a scenario, digital technologies will offer a much-needed resourcefor queer encounter, for a strikingly wide range of users and communities. It seemslikely that we will be met with a whole range of different spatial and conceptualconfigurations: the fresh air and ‘Outside’ of the George Michael pop song, and the‘inside’ indoor life of a coronavirus lockdown; the ‘online’ space of a dating app andthe ‘offline’ life of a gay bar—or all of these together, remixed and reformulated.ReferencesAhlmJ (2017)Respectable promiscuity: digital cruising in an era of queer liberalism.Sex20(3):364–379Aldrich R (2014) Homosexuality and the city: an historical overview.

Although Antwerphas come to be represented as the “gay capital” of Flanders, it never developed a full-fledged gay neighborhood in the Anglo-American tradition of the concept.

Its tripartite structure isshaped by the specific heuristic conditions set by it. Because the larger historicalcontext for the investigated subject remains to be written, the chapter first undertakesa substantial and panoramic survey of the emergence of gay nightlife in Antwerpduring the early half of the twentieth century. This provides the framework neededfor a more detailed analysis in the second part, which zooms in on an area in theimmediate vicinity of the Central Station and takes as its emblematic focus one suffi-ciently long-term and iconic gay bar, called Café Strange.

Eeckhout et al.10.1 IntroductionThis chapter proposes to investigate what historiographers would call the “long twen-tieth century” of lesbian and gay neighborhoods in the specific context of Antwerp,the largest city inFlanders (the northern,Dutch-speakingpart ofBelgium).1 AlthoughAntwerp has come to be represented as the “gay capital” of Flanders, we will showthat it never developed a full-fledged gay neighborhood in the Anglo-American tradi-tion of the concept—that is, a neighborhood characterized by the historical clusteringof a wide range of urban functions for sexual minorities (social, cultural, residen-tial, sexual, commercial, with service and hospitality industries as well as entertain-ment venues). As in several otherWestern European nations (and many non-Westerncountries besides), the clustering of sexual minorities in Antwerp has been limitedlargely to the economic, social, and cultural business of (nightlife) entertainment,with lesbian and gay meeting places historically concentrating in particular neigh-borhoods that, moreover, have shifted over time and dissipated again. This patternis a familiar one from the history of modern sexual identity formation. As the iden-tity of modern-day “homosexuals” came to be shaped and solidified (roughly asof the second half of the nineteenth century), people who identified increasingly asmembers of this demographic created private, semi-public, and publicmeeting spacesfor themselves, starting in larger cities such as Berlin and New York (Beachy 2014;Chauncey 1995). Bars and clubs became the principal spaces for escaping from socialnorms and invisibility, as well as for exploring same-sex attraction and alternativegender expressions. While the emergence of the same kind of venues in Antwerp isthus characterized by social and material parameters that, at a sufficiently high levelof abstraction, apply to many other cities in Western Europe (and, again, beyond),the more fine-grained analysis we intend to offer will inevitably reveal geographic,social, and cultural specificities for which a more detailed understanding of both theAntwerp and the Belgian contexts is necessary.A few aspects of this culturally specific context may be worth highlighting inadvance. Whereas in the following discussion we will automatically resort to theterm “neighborhood” as an established concept in the field of urban studies that iscrucial to a volume such as this, we will frequently alternate it with the less stronglyconnoted term “area.” This will be mainly to avoid habitual associations with thenotion of a neighborhood simply being projected onto the terrain we are discussing.For various historical, sociopolitical, economic, and cultural reasons, the social andmaterial granularity of Belgian cities is quite different from what is to be found inmost North-American (and a lot of English-speakingCommonwealth) cities. Belgianurban neighborhoods tend to be more finely grained and mixed, more complex intheir stratifications and less homogeneous, and as a result do not invite the samestrong sense of individuality and identity as do many of the iconic neighborhoods in1Throughout this chapter, we will use the shorthand terms “lesbian and gay” or merely “gay” asthey seem best suited to serve as historical umbrella terms for the core identity categories analyzedacross the period under discussion, even if they are anachronistic when applied to the period beforethe 1970s and too limitative for the twenty-first century.10 A Gay Neighborhood or Merely a Temporary Cluster … 223the English-speaking world, which are underwritten by a more outspoken logic ofdemarcation and differentiation. A basically historical, midsize city such asAntwerp,moreover, is defined by a relatively small core that allows for a close mixing offunctions. This means, among other things, that different parts of the city are easyto reach, whether on foot, by bicycle, or through public or private transportation.A self-chosen, not-economically enforced residential clustering of one segment ofthe population in one specific area—lesbians and gays in our historical shorthanddescription—has thus never seemed as necessary or enticing as in much bigger citiesabroad.To this should be added a larger cultural context: Flanders as a whole is a denselypopulated region inwhich especially the triangle Antwerp-Ghent-Brussels has some-times been described, in comparative international terms, as a single extended conur-bation (GUST 1999: 32–38; Albrechts and Lievois 2004). For a complex combina-tion of historical, sociopolitical, economic, and cultural reasons again, Flemings havetended to be lessmobile in their residential careers than citizens inmost othermodernnations; to this day, they still frequently prefer to stick to the area where they wereborn. This cultural pattern is so deeply ingrained that it applies even to lesbians andgays in the days of massive anti-homosexual hostility in rural Flanders, when onewould have expected a great many of them to engage in the same kind of “reversediaspora” (Sinfield 1996: 281) to central cities that has been historically character-istic of sexual and gender minorities in other countries. Throughout the period underdiscussion, in fact, a large number of Flemish lesbians and gays continued to live intheir immediate native areas and simply commuted into a city such as Antwerp fortheir nightlife entertainment (Vincke et al. 2006). Thus, as a rule, the users of thegay-specific facilities we will be describing were arriving from anywhere in the cityor, as it turns out, beyond. They did not build most of their lives around a specific,recognizably gay neighborhood, but made occasional use of the clusters of bars thatover time became available in Antwerp.Before we are able to embark on the following narrative and analysis, it is alsonecessary to reflect methodologically on how our investigation is shaped (bothenabled and restricted) by its heuristic conditions. Belgium is a small country frac-tured still further by the cultural divide between its two main linguistic communities(French- and Dutch-speaking). The scale limit has notable repercussions for theacademic availability of empirical data. Among other things, the country has notdeveloped a viable market for academic publications catering to the niche interestof sexual and gender minorities. Partly as a result, no truly encompassing history ofsuch minorities has been published so far, whether for the country as a whole or forthe region of Flanders, even though a number of attempts at presenting capita selectafrom this history have recently been made (Borghs 2015; Dupont 2015; Dupont et al.2017; Hellinck 2002). It should come as no surprise, then, that Antwerp’s lesbian andgay history remains to bewritten. Because none of the current chapter’s three authors,moreover, are themselves trained historians (they are, respectively, a literary scholarspecializing in American literature, a musicologist, and a media scholar), what thiscase study is about to present constitutes a first gathering of available data that shouldideally be followed up by more extensive historiographical research. Some of the224 B. Eeckhout et al.source materials for the following evocation will be, in fact, non-academic; theyconsist of archival findings by the second coauthor as part of his research project onmusical cultures in Antwerp2; some of the informal interviews he conducted in thiscontext; the cultural experience and knowledge of all three authors as participatoryobservers in Flemish/Antwerp society; and the authors’ wider reading in variousdisciplinary fields and relevant publications.The tripartite structure assumed by our case study is shaped by these conditions.Because the larger context for our subject remains to be written, it will be necessary,first, to undertake a relatively substantial and panoramic survey of the emergenceof gay nightlife in Antwerp during the early half of the twentieth century. This willprovide the framework needed for a more detailed analysis in the second part, whichwill zoom in on an area in the immediate vicinity of the Central Station and willtake as its emblematic focus one sufficiently long-term and iconic gay bar, calledCafé Strange. Finally, we will zoom out again to sketch how even such a limited gaynightlife cluster in Antwerp has evaporated again in the course of the twenty-firstcentury, leaving a landscape that is hard to map and largely virtual.10.2 The Emergence of a Gay Bar Culture in AntwerpWhile generally same-sex sexuality was severely punished from the Middle Agesuntil the French Revolution in the region currently known as Belgium (Dupont et al.2017; Hofman 2017; Roelens 2018), in 1795 the same region became a part ofFrance, where “sodomy” was subsequently removed from the penal code. Neitherthe French penal code of 1810 that was adopted in Belgium after the country’sindependence in 1830 nor the Belgian penal code of 1867 prohibited homosexualacts between consenting adults in private, although public displays of homosexualinterest and desire could be prosecuted for “assaults on honor and public decency”(Vanhaelewyn 2008: 248). This implies that for much of the nineteenth and twentiethcenturies, Belgian homosexuals were not as strongly persecuted as in many otherEuropean countries, though the fact that they were not actively oppressed by theState may also have slowed down lesbian and gay identity formation and socialactivism, especially in the largely Dutch-speaking and devoutly Catholic Flanders,where a conservative social value system persisted well into the second half of thetwentieth century (Dupont et al. 2017). Throughout this period, same-sex sexualitywas not publicly acknowledged, let alone socially accepted. Partly as a result, gaylife remained very much underground and has become hard to retrace from officialsources frequently used by historiographers in other countries, such as police files(Dupont 2015).Indeed, the most important source of information that we have about everydaylesbian and gay life in the early to mid-twentieth century consists of a number of2Some 70 LGBT and feminist commercial and political magazines published in Flanders between1960 and 2010 as well as a collection of ca. 1000 flyers of events in the city.10 A Gay Neighborhood or Merely a Temporary Cluster … 225autobiographies and oral history interviews with lesbians and gays.3 These tell usthat same-sex attraction and sexuality were nearly invisible within Belgian societyat large and, as a result, barely existed as concepts or possible realities in the mindsof most citizens. The topic was hardly ever brought up in families, schools, or themedia, and received but little attention in medical and psychiatric circles. If Flemingsever heard allusions being made to homosexuality at all, it would have been innegative terms. For those experiencing same-sex desire, this meant that many couldnot name their feelings in the first place, felt abnormal, sinful, and/or perverse, andconsidered it much safer to remain silent about their sexual orientation. At most,they would look for answers in books, secretly visited a doctor, or searched aroundin anonymous urban environments until they found bars where it seemed possibleto meet like-minded people. If they came to have sexual or romantic relations at all,it was behind closed doors or in transient urban spaces that made sexual cruisingmaterially possible. With very few exceptions, they would refrain from disclosingtheir sexual orientation to family, friends, neighbors, and/or colleagues, nor did theyassume a positive identity label for themselves; the coded language used by and forthem would be characterized by a strategic vagueness and imprecision: they were“like that,” “for the women,” or “for the men,” or “belonged to the family.”Although invisibility and silence thus reigned supreme in mainstream Flemishsociety, from the early twentieth century onwards some form of gay subculturedid start to emerge tentatively in out-of-the-way pockets, and it was Antwerp, inparticular, that began to develop something that might qualify as a gay nightlife(Hellinck 2002: 6). For those who could find their way to them, the semi-publicspaces of a handful of bars came to offer a haven where patrons could be more atease, meet other lesbians and gays, explore non-normative gender expressions, makefriends, and find lovers. In Antwerp, the epicenter of this budding gay subculture wassituated in the so-called Skippers Quarter (Schipperskwartier), which bordered onthe harbor.4 The location is no coincidence: it was arguably the city’s least Flemishand most transient space characterized by constant transnational flows of goods andpeople. The natural geography of the river Scheldt, whose extended estuary connectsAntwerp to the North Sea, had allowed the city to become for several centuriesEurope’s prime inland port. From the moment the river’s quays were straightenedin 1885, the Skippers Quarter became a defining neighborhood in the city (Lampo2002). It acquired its distinct, bustling character from the fact that it was closest towhere freighters docked andwhere, amongother things, theRedStarLine transportedhundreds of thousands of travelers to and from the US in the decades around the turnof the twentieth century. A large number of businesses flourished in this quarter,including cafés and temporary lodgings for sailors and travelers, as well as venues3This account is based on David and Meyntjens (2009), Kegels (2006, 2008), Van den Heuvel(2009) and Winters (2011).4The name is translated differently in different sources, e.g., as Sailors’ Quarter in Loopmans andVan Den Broeck 2011. Since the antiquated Dutch word schipper does not quite overlap with themore recent term sailor, and since the English word skipper is precisely derived from the Dutchschipper, we have chosen to remain close to the Dutch original by translating the area as SkippersQuarter.226 B. Eeckhout et al.for prostitution (Lampo 2011). Loopmans and Van Den Broeck (2011) have in facttraced the roots for such typical harbor prostitution much further back in history,calling the area one of the oldest red-light districts in Europe, whose origins lie inthe fifteenth century.It is here, near the river and the harbor, that Antwerp’s gay nightlife most probablyfirst took shape. According to Armand Everaert, the owner of Café Strange (to whichwe will turn in a moment), at least the ill-reputed neighborhood of the SkippersQuarter, with its red-light district, guaranteed a modicum of anonymity (Hellinck2015). Not only situated at the geographical margins of the city, the neighborhoodalso occupied a social position at the margins of respectable mainstream society.By the same token, it could offer a refuge and free port for non-normative formsof sexuality and gender expression. Yet, while we may be certain that same-sexsexual practices took place there, it is not so clear whether the area already witnesseda minimally organized form of homosexual subculture during the late nineteenthcentury, and if so, whether this was then integrated in the established business ofheterosexual prostitution. In his semi-autobiographical novel of 1888, La NouvelleCarthage, the Francophone Flemish writer Georges Eekhoud at one point describesa “crystal palace” (palais de crystal) in the red-light district of Antwerp. The interior,which is evoked as a cave full of mirrors, is described in detail, and the descriptionsuggests that the writer’s inspiration was the renowned luxury brothel in the SkippersQuarter called Crystal Palace (Min 2011: 214–215). Eekhoud, who was a brave earlyvoice in the literary description of same-sex desire, probably visited the place, andin his novel he suggests that “all stages of debauchery” took place there. Yet hisdescription leaves unclear whether this also involved same-sex practices.For the early half of the twentieth century, there is evidence, at least, that dragperformances had begun to take place in the Skippers Quarter. Thus, a woman by thename of Bertha (born in 1916) remembers that a friend took her to a transvestite barat the age of sixteen (David and Meyntjens 2009: 24). Perhaps they visited a “bingecafé,” where the staff—mostly women and/or men in drag—tried to tempt the maleclientele to drink as much as possible (De Graef 1973). One such place was Danny’sBar, a notorious sailors’ bar mentioned in the anonymous folk poem “One Hell ofa Pub Crawl!” as a venue where the “she” appears to be very much a man.5 Boththe owner, going by the nickname of “den Daan” (Danny Boy), and his male staffwere dressed as women, and they took it upon them to seduce the sailors into binginguncontrollably. When “Marie,” one of Daan’s male staff members, later took overthe bar, he and his wife continued to work as transvestites (Kegels 2008).On the online forum “YO! Liverpool,” a former sailor by the name of BrianDaley reminisces about his own later, postwar experiences at Danny’s Bar.6 At therecommendation of a few older sailors, Brian and two of his friends visited the barto “lose their cherries.” His testimony, dated March 2008, is worth quoting at some5See http://www.merchant-navy.net/forum/poetry-and-ballads/29047-hell-pub-crawl.html, lastaccessed 18 June 2019.6See http://www.yoliverpool.com/forum/showthread.php?5415-Hullo-Old-Home&p=125649&highlight=Danny%27s+Bar#post125649, last accessed 2 January 2020.10 A Gay Neighborhood or Merely a Temporary Cluster … 227length (with corrected punctuation for the sake of readability) because it allows usto immerse ourselves in this bygone world:There it was! Danny’s Bar, the bright green neon lighting the way to heaven. It was onlyabout 8.00 p.m. and the streets were not yet crowded; we entered the bar and were almostblinded by the lights and mirrors, chrome and dark mahogany and brass. The most beautifulwomen that I had seen this side of the silver screen sat at the tables around the bar. There wereno men in there, just us three boys. There was a Lana Turner lookalike in an off-the-shouldergown, her pale skin and generous bosom thrusting at the front of her dress; there was JanePowell, and Rhonda Fleming too. The guys had been telling the truth; and they wanted tosit with us!! Oh heaven, this surely was Fiddlers Green. So there we were, a lady by each ofour sides and they were buying our drinks. Somebody put a record on the jukebox and Lanatook my hand and led me to the floor. She took a firm hold of me, pressing her body intomine; should I kiss her? Her perfume and the feel of her bosom thrusting into my chest hadmy hormones running wild. Her husky continental accent, sounding like Marlene Dietrich,had my trousers near at bursting point; she knew [this] and whispered into my ear. “Youwant to make love, Dollink?” she asked, rasping her five o’clock shadow against my virginalcheek. AAAARRGH!!!!! Lanawas a Laddie, not a lady.We threemade our discovery almostsimultaneously; as we shot to the door, we could hear Danny laughing his head off. “Goodnight, Darlings,” he cried after us.Brian’s adventure was apparently part of a tradition built up over the years. By wayof a joke, older sailors would recommend Danny’s Bar to inexperienced newcomers;sometimes they would join them to watch the results. A few years after Brian’s firstexperience, it was his turn to initiate two younger fellow-sailors, Eddy and Terry. In afollow-up recollection, posted in November 2008,7 Brian explains how this missionwent awry when his drink was drugged and he woke up in bed with a “lady.”As these anecdotes illustrate, clients were frequently made to get drunk, some-times drugged, in order to make them spend as muchmoney as possible and even endup in bed with one of the “girls” (Kegels 2008). For sailors, a visit to Danny’s Barcould be a hazing ritual, though in some cases it may have served as a site of sexualand gender exploration as well. Jack De Graef (1973: 104–105) describes the storyof a man who spent the evening and night with a professional transvestite, and wasbrought home the next day by taxi—broke, tired, and with memory problems. Whileundressing him, his wife discovered he was wearing women’s panties (Fig. 10.1).The gay clientele of the Skippers Quarter steadily grew; on the eve of the SecondWorldWar, the neighborhood had apparently acquired a distinctly gay connotation tothose in the know. By then, among other changes, the Crystal Palace brothel had beentransformed into a gay bar (Kegels 2008; Min 2011). In the postwar years, however,the bars where lesbian and gay patrons could meet up started to spread beyond theSkippers Quarter. Though a few of these opened in the historical center, in the areaaround theCathedral andCityHall,most of the newvenues sprang up in the area closeto theCentral Station, the grandly sculpted railroad terminal for commuters to the eastof the city center. These were in general small operations; the most famous amongthem were called Shakespeare (in the historical center) and Café Strange, Fortunia,Week-End, and La Ronde near the train station. Since most of such bars were a clear7See http://www.yoliverpool.com/forum/showthread.php?5415-Hullo-Old-Home&p=155101&highlight=Dannys#post155101, last accessed 2 January 2020.228 B. Eeckhout et al.(a) (b)Fig. 10.1 The invisible gay history of the Skippers Quarter: where for most of the twentieth centuryDanny’s Bar used to be (until the mid-1990s), today a stretch of new-built residential houses and abrasserie are to be found (left), and in the historically narrow alley where the Crystal Palace used tobe (until the building collapsed in the 1960s), bland architecture now reigns supreme (right) (SourceImages by Bart Eeckhout, April 2020)distance from the Skippers Quarter, they attracted a different clientele, though somesailors and sex workers would visit the nearest one, Shakespeare, until the 1960s(David and Meyntjens 2009: 143–144). There was a gender difference in patrons aswell. Whereas Shakespeare had a female bartender, Jackie, and attracted a mostlyfemale crowd, the bars near the train station hadmale bartenders and clientele: “DikkePiet” (Fat Pete) was the gay bartender of Fortunia, “Miss Banaan” (Miss Banana)served atWeek-End, and the drag queen “Eddy”/“Edith” at La Ronde (Winters 2011:56–58; Kegels 2008: 37–38, 64, 89–90).As of the 1950s, the names of suchnewbarsmore often contained coded referencesto homosexual culture. Older bars’ names in the Skippers Quarter that had alreadybeen in operation before they attracted a gay clientele would sometimes refer to theharbor location (De Lichttoren [The Lighthouse]), to a region (Café Normandie),the bar’s owner (Danny’s Bar), or the venue’s interior design (Crystal Palace). Ofthese, only Pigalle had a sexual connotation, because it conjured up the Parisianneighborhood around Place Pigalle in Montmartre, famous for its sexual and eroticnightlife (including the iconic Moulin Rouge cabaret). The newer bars springing upin other Antwerp neighborhoods occasionally sported more allusive if ambiguousnames that carried various overtones for insiders. For instance, “Shakespeare” evokedboth the world-famous playwright (whose love sonnets, some connoisseurs began10 A Gay Neighborhood or Merely a Temporary Cluster … 229to realize, principally courted a mysterious young man) and a Dutch lesbian andgay organization by the same name. When one of the gay bars in the vicinity ofthe station, Week-End, changed owners in the late 1950s, it was renamed as La Vieen Rose (Pink Life), thereby alluding not only to the eponymous song by EdithPiaf, the French singer who was then becoming a cult diva among homosexuals,but also to the growing symbolism of the color pink, which, under the influence ofAmerican clothes manufacturers, had come to be reserved almost exclusively foryoung girls and thus carried a strong feminine connotation (Paoletti 2012). The bar’sconspicuously gendered name, in combination with its location, signaled its statusto a gay clientele.Meanwhile, the older bars in the Skippers Quarter began to be closed, at firstslowly in the 1960s, when the streets behind the City Hall were renovated, and moredrastically in the mid-eighties, when much of the neighborhood was modernized bytown planners, and its former occupants, particularly sex workers, were pushed tothe north, away from the backstreets bordering on the historical center and towardthe modern harbor and docks (Loopmans and Van Den Broeck 2011). It is there thata new generation of larger gay-friendly bars and clubs came to take root, such asHessenhuis (opened in 1993) and Red & Blue (opened in 1998). As before, suchslight geographic displacements were relevant only to the location of bars and clubs,because the local lesbian and gay population as a rule had not sought to move intoany of these neighborhoods and had not set up a community life, service sector, orcultural industry in them (Fig. 10.2).10.3 The Paradigmatic Case History of Café Strangein the Central Station AreaSo far, we have limited ourselves largely to a bird’s-eye view of the permutations oftwentieth-century gay nightlife in Antwerp as it originated in the Skippers Quarterand, in the second half of the century, moved to additional neighborhoods. From itsearly roots in an environment of cultural marginality, clandestine behavior, drunkensailors, and ambiguously gendered sex workers, such nightlife was gradually trans-planted to a somewhat less ill-reputed (if still predominantly working-class and tran-sient) neighborhood near the city’sCentral Station.Café Strange offers a fine exampleto elaborate this move in some architectural and social detail. Because of the venue’slongevity, moreover (it still survives), it presents a sufficiently extended case studythat allows us to ponder the twenty-first-century decline of gay bar life in Antwerpas well.In 1955, a gay-friendly bar in the Dambruggestraat, a street located near thepopular neighborhood Seefhoek, was reopened by the gay couple Bruno and Julien(Kegels 2008: 112–113). The bar was renamed “Café Strange” (in English), clearlyto act as a magnet on patrons who at the time were still often dismissed as “queer”in the anglophone world and did not yet have a language of collective pride as230 B. Eeckhout et al.Fig. 10.2 The Hessenhuis, built in 1564, belongs to Antwerp’s historical patrimony. After reno-vation in 1975 it reopened as a temporary exhibition space. Since 1993 it has also been housing agay(-friendly) café/club catering to a younger crowd (Source Image by Bart Eeckhout, April 2020)a sexual minority. At the time, the epicenter of gay life was probably still in theSkippers Quarter, yet by then the Dambruggestraat also happened to host the gay barFortunia, and the street was conveniently within walking distance from the station,with its daily crowd of national commuters and international travelers, as well as oneof the largest and most notorious public toilets (in front of the station), where menwere known to hook up and/or have sex with other men (Kegels 2008: 75–79).Like Shakespeare, Café Strange was one of the local pioneers when it came toalluding to the kind of patrons it targeted, and the nature of the bar, through itsvery name. In response to the wider Flemish culture of secrecy about homosexu-ality, however, the name was still vaguely suggestive rather than explicit. In additionto the bar’s name and location, prospective patrons were actively canvassed in duecourse through advertisements in publicly little-known subculturalmedia, such as themember magazine of BVSR, the Belgian Association for Sexual Justice (BelgischeVereniging voor Sexuele Rechtvaardigheid), one of the first Belgian LGBT asso-ciations, founded in 1965. At the same time, the owners had to remain discreteand safeguard the privacy of their patrons. In accordance with customs at the time,curtains were used to prevent passersby from looking in through the windows, andpatrons had to knock or ring a bell to get in, as the entrance door was frequentlyclosed. Like many other such bars, Café Strange sported a separate porch at the10 A Gay Neighborhood or Merely a Temporary Cluster … 231entrance, whose purpose was to avoid patrons making themselves too visible whenthey entered and exited. This architectural idiosyncrasy survives today, as the bar stillhas three entrance doors: one in the front, which is unlocked only when the ownerarrives, and two in a porch providing access either to the bar or to the apartmentsabove. According to the current proprietor, Armand, the first gay owners, Bruno andJulien, made a great effort to change the place when they bought it, and it is likelythey replaced the main entrance to adapt the bar to the desires of patrons.Café Strange first opened as “Brasserie Strange,” which in the Belgian contextimplies that both food and drinks were served. As it became increasingly popularover the years, the owners were forced to enlarge the main room. The interior waschanged oncemore when additional gay bars and discos opened in the neighborhood.Bruno and Julien gave Café Strange a look that was similar to such competitors, bothby adding a large buffet at the end of the room, close to the courtyard, and by movingseats against the wall to provide enough space for dancing. One visitor from thoseyears recalls it as a nice place with friendly staff (Kegels 2008: 66, 112). Even so,by the end of the 1970s, Café Strange faced a series of difficulties. After Bruno haddied, his partner Julien took over from 1977 to 1979, but he got himself involvedin dubious relationships that ended dramatically by his getting killed (Daems 2010:4). By then, the international gay travelers’ guide Spartacus was warning its readersabout the presence of rent boys mixing among the mostly elderly gay men.8 In 1980,after undertaking some minor renovations, another gay couple took over, Armandand Roger. Their purpose was to carry on the tradition of Café Strange as a gay bar.They painted the building’s façade pink and added a drawing of a sexy sailor as asymbol, thereby referencing gay culture and erotica more openly. Inside, picturesof semi-naked and naked men were hung on the walls. The new owners moved thelarge buffet to the front and added two couches there. Several gay bars, again, hadthis kind of set-up. Among other things, it allowed the owner or bartender to openthe door quickly when someone was waiting outside, or to keep an eye on patronswalking in when the door was open. At the same time, those who were sitting on thecouches had a practical way of checking out whoever came in (Fig. 10.3).9The new owners, who were experienced entrepreneurs, continued to promote thebusiness as a bar as well as a discotheque with room to dance, but they were lookingto attract more customers as well. Instead of sticking to the traditional jukebox, theyacquired a professional DJ set with turntable, hired DJs to ensure that a continuousflow of music was being played during parties, bought new recordings on a regularbasis, and advertised in both national and international LGBT media—for instance,in the much-read Dutch Gay Krant and international guides such as Spartacus.Furthermore, they produced a magazine called Antwerp Gay Plan with informationabout gay leisure in the city and personal stories, among other things.Their approach was successful. The place developed the reputation of being atonce modern, popular, and low-key (De Bie 2012; Everaert 2014). The atmosphere8See, e.g., the 1979 edition of the Spartacus International Gay Guide, p. 53.9This information is based on an interview with Armand, conducted by the second author on 27January 2014.232 B. Eeckhout et al.Fig. 10.3 Café Strange in the Dambruggestraat. The salmon-colored façade has lost much of itsformer pink glamor. Note the old-fashioned device behind the window that lights up to signal thatthe bar is open (Source Image by Bart Eeckhout, April 2020)10 A Gay Neighborhood or Merely a Temporary Cluster … 233seems to have been unpretentious and folksy, in accordance with the baseline ofthe ads the bar placed at the time: “casual, happily free, cosy” (“losjes, vrij en blij,gezellig”; De Homokrant 1982, ed. 9, p. 27). Armand and Roger frequently threwparties to celebrate special occasions and traditions, such as their birthdays, carnival,Saint Nicholas Day, New Year’s Eve, and Easter. These tended to follow lightlyscripted formats that usually involved dressing up to a theme (e.g., prostitution, operaand operetta, the fifties), with the best-dressed visitors receiving at times remarkablyexpensive prizes. For instance, a flyer announcing the carnival ball for 1982 promisesto winners a flight to Athens, a weekend to Amsterdam or Paris, or a dinner in anAntwerp restaurant, among other things. The announcement further mentions theowners’ wish that patrons participate in the occasion with no holds barred: “thecrazier the better,” it says.Besides themeparties, thereweremore regular andordinaryevents, such as “tea dances” (thé dansants) on Sundays, when, according to a 1985ad in the Flemish gay newspaper De Homokrant, a DJ would play “golden hits, filmmusic, and popcorn oldies” (ed. 2, p. 31). The majority of visitors to Café Strangeappear to have been gay, lesbian, or bisexual, although national and internationalgay guides show that the demographic shifted over the years, from a relatively widerrange in age and gender during the 1980s to a crowd of mostly gay men during the1990s, and then morphing into a mix of gay and gay-friendly patrons a decade later.The bar stayed financially quite profitable until the 1990s, when the number ofpatrons began to dwindle. While Café Strange is still open at the time of writing(in 2020), most other gay bars in the area (and a good many cafés in general acrossthe city) have closed. In an interview he gave in 2010, Armand claims that thenumber of gay bars in the Van Schoonhovenstraat, the main artery in the neighbor-hood, had by then already declined from 23 to three or four (Daems 2010: 5).10Once again, the sense of a “gay neighborhood” had always been limited to a clusterof bars, by and large, although for a while this area close to the train station didcontain a few community-oriented gay venues, too. The most important of these wasthe GOC (Gespreks- en Onthaalcentrum), one of the first Flemish LGBT associa-tions, founded in 1968 under a blandly incommunicative name (“Conversation andReception Center”) borrowed from the earliest stages of the LGBT movement inthe Netherlands.11 The GOC had a bar of its own in the Dambruggestraat, and asArmand recalls, whenever the organization’s bar closed at 1 a.m., a good many of10Archive research by the second author allows us to estimate the number of bars in the VanSchoonhovenstraat per decade. Although the last period, 2000–2010, suggests a thriving bar scene,these were mostly new bars which closed after a year or two.Until 1960: 2.1960–1969: 5.1970–1979: 22.1980–1989: 35.1990–1999: 24.2000–2010: 23.11See http://www.holebipioniers.be/geschiedenis/de-eerste-stappen-naar-buiten, last accessed on 3January 2020.234 B. Eeckhout et al.the patrons and staff tended to cross the street to extend the night at Café Strange(Daems 2010: 4).10.4 The Decline of Gay Bar Life in AntwerpThere are many different reasons why commercial gay bar life in the area to the northofAntwerp’sCentral Station started to decline toward the end of the twentieth centuryuntil it has by now—two decades into the twenty-first century—all but disappeared.Some of these reasons are common to a logic that has characterized Western citiesaround the turn of the millennium in general; others are part of an even larger, globaldynamic; only a handful seem to demand the same attention to specific and localplayers as we needed for painting the preceding portrait of twentieth-century bar lifein the city.We would nevertheless like to start this concluding section by taking the finalcategory of reasons first, because we need it to understand the transition in suffi-cient detail. First of all, as the LGBTIQ movement in Flanders started to organizeitself better (roughly as of the 1980s), it became effectively a growing competitorfor the small commercial bars in central cities: a multiplying number of activistand community-building grassroots organizations, which also improved quickly atprofessionalizing their activities, depended heavily on the income they generatedby organizing popular parties in bigger venues on a regular basis. For many youngLGBTs interested in socializing on a larger scale and outside of commercial enter-prises, these became the primary nightlife entertainment where they came togetherand built their networks of friends. As a result, the small bars in the station area wereincreasingly left behind with an aging clientele in the habit of hopping over to theirfavorite bars, whether during weekends or on ordinary weekdays. From the 1990sonwards, moreover, a second type of competitor appeared on the scene, this timecommercial. A handful of gay-friendly mega clubs, commercial party formats, andmainstream mixed bars, such as Hessenhuis and Red & Blue (both located in theredeveloped part of town to the north of the Skippers Quarter), made sure to expandtheir business by seeking to seize a big part of the pie of LGBT leisure culture.Particularly the younger crowd came to expect more spectacle than the small barswere able to offer, a tendency Armand and Roger explicitly deplored in a publishedinterview: “It used to be enough that you opened the door and people came floodingin, whereas nowadays they grow tired of everything so soon. Things have to getmore and more extravagant” (see Hellinck 2015: 16). As the couple of aging barowners observed, this has had an atrophying effect on the cross-class (and cross-age)tradition of the local gay bar culture: “Back in the old days everybody was sittingtogether, intellectuals or not. You found yourself sitting next to a doctor or a lawyer,no matter: you were gay and you were being regarded as gay. Whereas nowadayssuch mixing is frowned upon: ‘Oh, but he’s only a laborer in the harbor.’ That’s thementality that dominates today, more and more so” (Hellinck 2015: 16). To theserising pressures from outside players should be added more internal pressures in the10 A Gay Neighborhood or Merely a Temporary Cluster … 235form of the overall decline both of the area where the gay bars were clustered andof the quality of encounters inside the bars. National and international LGBT mediahad begun to report on a growing sense of unsafety and physical decay, especially inthe main artery of the Van Schoonhovenstraat, which was said to be crime-ridden.“Rue de Vaseline” (Vaseline Street), as it was commonly nicknamed in gay circles,had gradually gained a sleazy reputation (Fig. 10.4).With economic competition thus coming from two sides—one activist, onecommercial—and the reputation of the area and its gay venues becoming ever moredubious, the bars in the station area came to seem old-fashioned, uneventful, sleazy,and unsafe, with dire consequences for their commercial viability. Nearly all of themwent out of business as a result. This leaves us with a very different urban landscapetoday: the parties thrown by noncommercial players have in turn all but disappearedagain (the mainstream Flemish LGBTIQ movement is now heavily subsidized andsports its own Rainbow House with a daily bar in a completely different part of thecity, so that grassroots parties nowadays tend to be limited to the small, more radical,self-styled queer movement that has recently emerged), while the bigger commercialplayers are so few and intrinsically such self-sufficient institutions with their ownFig. 10.4 The final stretch of the Van Schoonhovenstraat in the direction of Antwerp’s monumentalCentral Station. Several of the buildings on the left used to house the gay bars that gave the streetits nickname of Vaseline Street and that have since gone out of business (Source Image by BartEeckhout, April 2020)236 B. Eeckhout et al.internal business logic that they cannot be said to build a recognizable spatial clusterin the city anymore.An additional contextualizing paragraph on gentrification may be in order here aswell, even if we include it so as to nuance its importance to our particular case study.Although Antwerp went through a process of modernist urban planning in the periodafter the Second World War, which also affected the Skippers Quarter (Loopmansand Van Den Broeck 2011), the streets harboring the gay bars near the train stationremained largely untouched by it (Loopmans 2008). And while from 1983 onwards,after a decade of mostly economic crisis in the 1970s, urban planning in the cityreceived a new impetus, again this focused on other areas of Antwerp, particularlythose near the waterfront and the historical center. It was only by the 1990s, in fact,that a new phase of urban planning focused on the “livability” of poorer, inner-cityneighborhoods. This slow and partial makeover gradually included the area to thenorth of the Central Station to which the cluster of gay bars belongs (Loopmans2008). Yet even then, the actual material effects of such city-planned upgradingseem to postdate, by and large, the demise of the local world of gay bars, which wasmore driven by the logic described in the previous paragraphs than by any form ofcity planning or gentrification pushing the bars out of business.All of these micro-changes on the ground within the city of Antwerp should obvi-ously be framed again in a larger cultural context—that of the relatively quick shiftin attitudes toward sexual and gender minorities within Western European societiesoverall, a shift that has arguably been even faster in Belgium (and especially Flan-ders) than in most of its neighboring countries. From being a deeply conservative,largely Catholic country, Belgium has leaped to the forefront of LGBTIQ rightsin Europe in just a few decades’ time, currently outranking all of its neighbors.12This evolution has been most outspoken in Flanders, where the extent of secular-ization has made for the starkest historical contrast and the LGBTIQ movementhas been particularly successful at organizing itself and exerting political influence.Especially as of the 1990s, sexual and gender minorities have become much morevisible in the Flemish media and public life, thereby both stimulating and reflectingincreasing social acceptance by the wider population. In these quickly transformingcircumstances, the relatively exclusive, niche-specific, semi-public spaces of lesbianand gay bars that promised a safe haven in a largely hostile environment lost theirraison d’être faster than anyone would have expected a few decades ago. In recentyears, even center-right political coalitions that have seized power in Antwerp haveembraced their LGBTIQ population and gone out of their way to market the entirecity, rather than any particular part of it, as a gay-friendly tourist destination. Evenordinary zebra crossings have now been painted in rainbow colors.Finally, at the global level, LGBTIQ life has been transformed by the virtualizationof sexual networks in urban space as a result of new technologies. Digital,mobile, andsocial media allow for instantaneous contact across the globe, allowing LGBTIQs to12See Borghs and Eeckhout (2010), Eeckhout and Paternotte (2011); and the annual Rainbow Mapof Europe drawn up by ILGA-Europe, where for nearly a decade now Belgium has ranked aroundsecond place in all of Europe (https://rainbow-europe.org/country-ranking).10 A Gay Neighborhood or Merely a Temporary Cluster … 237connect across geographical boundaries beyond their immediate (urban) dwelling.At the same time, location-based services, in particular dating apps such as Grindr,allow LGBTIQs to identify and connect with other LGBTIQs within their urban oreven rural contexts. Both tendencies, combined, have further eroded the need forseparate LGBTIQ spaces as a way to get in touch with other LGBTIQ people andthe appeal of a city like Antwerp as a magnet for LGBTIQ people.ReferencesAlbrechts L, Lievois G (2004) The Flemish diamond: urban network in the making?

NashAbstract This chapter argues that the historical geographies of Toronto’s Churchand Wellesley Street district and Sydney’s Oxford Street gay villages are importantin understanding ongoing contemporary transformations in both locations. LGBTand queer communities as well as mainstream interests argue that these gay villagesare in some form of “decline” for various social, political, and economic reasons.Given their similar histories and geographies, our analysis considers how these histor-ical geographies have both enabled and constrained how the respective gay villagesrespond to these challenges, opening up and closing down particular possibilitiesfor alternative (and relational) geographies. While there are a number of ways toconsider these historical geographies, we focus on three factors for analysis: post-WorldWar II planning policies, the emergence of “city of neighborhoods” discourses,and the positioning of gay villages within neoliberal processes of commodificationand consumerism. We conclude that these distinctive historical geographies offer acogent set of understandings by providing suggestive explanations for how Toronto’sand Sydney’s gendered and sexual landscapes are being reorganized in distinctiveways, and offer some wider implications for urban planning and policy.Keywords Toronto, Canada · Sydney, Austrlia · Neighborhood · Gayborhood ·Urban Change · Urban Planning11.1 IntroductionIn this chapter,we examine the historical geographies of the now iconic gayvillages inToronto’s Church andWellesley Street district and Sydney’s Oxford Street.We arguethat a comparative historical geography approach provides insights into complexA.

Nashand multidimensional processes fomenting an ongoing and distinctive reordering ofgendered and sexual landscapes occurring in both Toronto and Sydney. In doingso, we contribute to the ongoing debates about the nature, characteristics, andimplications of the shifting fortunes of some traditional gay villages in the GlobalNorth.We begin by discussing geographical scholarship on the emergence of gay villagesin the Global North with an emphasis on contemporary literature detailing theperceived “decline” of some longstanding gay villages, including those in Torontoand Sydney. We also explain why a comparative historical geography of Toronto andSydney is insightful.We then present the distinctive historical geographies underpin-ning the emergence of each city’s gay neighborhoods in the post-WorldWar II period,discussing convergences anddivergences. The concluding discussion underscores thedifferences and draws on our historical geographical analysis to pose questions abouttheir future. Throughout, the acronym LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans) refers toidentities grouped together to reflect collective interests and community as genderedand sexual minorities, while queer denotes a contemporary moment when some indi-viduals reject a gendered and sexual specificity but still position themselves withinnon-normative gender and sexual understandings—a positioning reflected in recenturban changes.11.2 Historical Geographies of Gay Villages: Segregationand IntegrationA substantial body of scholarship examines the emergence and development of gayvillages in the Global North in the period following World War II. This researchhighlights the dominant role that gay men (mainly white and middle-class) playedin the development and growth of gay villages, initially through their appropriationof places for safety and support to their use of these neighborhoods for political,social, and economic security and activism (Castells 1983; Chauncey 1994; Doanand Higgins 2011; Gorman-Murray andWaitt 2009; Knopp 1990; Lewis 2012; Nash2006). Simultaneously, lesbians and queer women also inhabited urban locations andneighborhoods and utilized gay village spaces, albeit in distinctive and less visibleways (Adler and Brenner 1992; Nast 2002; Podmore 2001, 2013; Rothenberg 1995;Valentine 1993, 1996). Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, these districts increas-ingly engaged in local politics, consolidating their presence and creating communitythrough economic development, the provision of services, and political activismaround rights protections. The HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s helped cement villagesas hubs of LGBT life, and in places such as Toronto and Sydney they provided coreservices including hospice care, outreach, health education, and counseling services(Kinsman 1996; Warner 2002; Willett 2000a; Wotherspoon 1991).In the 1980s, gay villages were increasingly caught up in broader urban socialand economic processes that saw them incorporated, through the neoliberal policy11 Recovering the Gay Village: A Comparative … 241initiatives of the entrepreneurial city, into increasingly commodified and consum-able urban landscapes (Bell and Binnie 2002; Binnie 2000; Binnie and Skeggs 2004;Visser 2008). Currently, both Toronto and Sydney represent their respective villagesas examples of their tolerance and openness to diversity. This incorporation intomainstream urban life has prompted some scholars to argue that the assimilation ofsome LGBT people into mainstream life both reflects and reinforces LGBT “neolib-eral sexual politics” that privilege those gendered and sexual minorities who arewilling to participate in normative, middle-class, consumer society within monog-amous married coupledom (Brown 2008; Duggan 2003; Richardson 2005). Thisframing of a “homonormative politic” has prompted some to argue that we cannotunderstand this to be a universal or monolithic result and that we need to attend tothe “difference, unevenness and geographical specificity” of gendered and sexualrelations in the gay village and beyond (Brown 2009: 1498).As recent scholarship suggests, contemporary gay villages, including those inToronto and Sydney, are experiencing forms of “degaying” within broader political,social, and economic processes at work in many Global North cities (Collins 2004;Ruting 2008; Gorman-Murray and Waitt 2009; Nash 2013a; Visser 2013). Part ofthis process is the commodification of gay villages as tourist venues, as well asshopping and entertainment districts, which has attracted awide variety of consumersand businesses not necessarily identifying as LGBT. Many LGBT venues are nowpopular with heterosexuals while other social spaces such as bars and restaurants arebecoming more mixed or have lost their queer sensibility entirely. In both Canadaand Australia, legislative and social recognition of LGBT people has resulted in theirincreasing visibility in a broad range of locations beyond the gay village in placesunderstood to be “gay friendly.”Whilemany argue this newvisibility is only availableto certain normatively gendered and sexualized gays and lesbians, others suggestthese spatial changes reflect greater acceptance of sexual and gendered difference, aswell as a growing social cohesion across a wide variety of neighborhoods (Ghaziani2021; Gorman-Murray and Waitt 2009; Nash 2013a; Visser 2013). Nevertheless,as scholars argue, while some gays and lesbians are able to fully integrate into themainstream, others continue to be marginalized as “queer,” that is, as those livingoutside of the homonormative lifestyles supported by legislative and social change(Binnie 2004; Ghaziani 2011; see also Duggan 2003; Richardson 2005).The literature also suggests that gay villages are in decline because of increasedinternet and social media use (Miles 2021), allowing LGBT and queer individuals tofind other like-minded individuals without the need for expressly LGBT and queerspaces such as gay villages (Miles 2021; Mowlabocus 2010; Nash and Gorman-Murray 2019a; Usher and Morrison 2010). Some LGBT and queer people, partic-ularly youth, perceive the gay village as reflective of older generations’ histories,sensibilities, and lifestyles (Nash 2013a; Sullivan 2005). These locations are arguablyof little interest to newer generations, who are able to experience a wider varietyof locations, identities, and subjectivities, and who are less interested, perhaps, insubscribing to essentialized gay and lesbian identities associated with gay villages.242 A. Gorman-Murray and C. J. NashBoth Toronto and Sydney include well-established gay villages, which over thelast thirty years have been fully integrated into the fabric of each city’s downtowncore. Toronto’s gay village emerged in the late 1970s and is presently centered onthe intersection of Church and Wellesley Streets, one block east of Yonge Street(Fig. 11.1), Toronto’s main downtown thoroughfare (Kinsman 1996; Warner 2002;Nash 2006). Today, the village remains the hub of gay social, economic, and politicallife with its collection of iconic bars (Fig. 11.2), restaurants, bathhouses, convenienceFig. 11.1 Map of Church-Wellesley Village, Toronto (Source Map by Authors)11 Recovering the Gay Village: A Comparative … 243Fig. 11.2 Church Street, Toronto (Source “Toronto Church St” by ed and eddie is licensed underCC BY-SA 2.0)stores, restaurants, and boutique shops, serving a substantial LGBT population inthe surrounding residential neighborhood (Fig. 11.3). Sydney’s gay village, popu-larly called Oxford Street, is adjacent to the Central Business District (CBD) in theinner east (Fig. 11.4). Nightlife, leisure, and commercial activities are focused alongOxford Street between College Street and Taylor Square (presently), comprisingbars, clubs, cafes, sex shops, and other retailers, while there is a congregation ofLGBT venues, community facilities (social and health services), and residents in thesurrounding suburbs of Darlinghurst, Surry Hills, Paddington, and Potts Point.At the present time, both Oxford Street and the Church andWellesley villages areundergoing some form of metamorphosis. In both cities there is considerable debateover the exact nature and underlying causes of these changes, whether they can beunderstood as positive or negative, and whether LGBT and queer political organi-zations should be actively engaged in guiding or directing these transformations.Given that both villages and related events, such as Pride andMardi Gras, are used todemonstrate their city’s cosmopolitanism and competitiveness, mainstream interests,including local municipal councils and LGBT organizations, are concerned about thepotential fate of their gay neighborhoods. To understand the nature and framing ofthese debates, we argue that it is important to understand each of these village’shistorical geographies.Historical geographies offer insights into current processes, providing insights intothe “how” and the “why” of current developments. Referring to the development ofgay commercial districts, Camilla Bassi (2006: 215) argues, “each locale possessesits own peculiar historical and social processes, the outcome of which is by no means244 A. Gorman-Murray and C. J. NashFig. 11.3 519 Church Street Community Centre, Toronto (Source 519 Church Street CommunityCentre Toronto by Neal Jennings is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0)certain.” Both Toronto and Sydney are world cities and major gateways for immigra-tion and settlement (Bunting and Filion 2000; Desfor et al. 2006; Filion 1996; Sewell1993). While it is beyond the scope of this chapter to lay out in detail the similaritiesbetween Toronto’s and Sydney’s gay village development, we would argue that ourown work documents the notably similar political, economic, and social histories ofthe ongoing development of gay villages in Toronto and Sydney (Gorman-Murrayand Nash 2014, 2017; Nash and Gorman-Murray 2014; Nash 2006, 2013a). LGBTand queer political and social activism within discrete national contexts has beenmarkedly similar but with varying and distinctive differences (Tremblay, Paternotteand Johnson 2011).In the following sections, we consider their respective historical geographiesthrough three specific themes—post World War II planning policies, the emergenceof “city of neighborhoods” discourses, and the positioning of gay villages withinneoliberal processes of commodification and consumerism.11 Recovering the Gay Village: A Comparative … 245Fig. 11.4 Map of Sydney’s LGBT neighborhoods: the Inner East, centred on Oxford Street,Darlinghurst, and the Inner West, centred on King Street, Newtown (Source Maps by Authors)246 A. Gorman-Murray and C. J. Nash11.3 Historical Geographies of Sexuality in TorontoThis section examines the intertwined histories of Toronto’s shifting urban planningpolicies and the changing fortunes of what has become Toronto’s “traditional” gayvillage. As one of Canada’s major cities, Toronto’s population increased substan-tially in the late 1930s as the country geared up for war, and then again during thewar efforts in the 1940s (Sewell 1993). Toronto’s downtown core, centered aroundYonge Street from south of Bloor Street to Front Street, gained considerable noto-riety, dotted with massage parlors, strip joints, discount stores, and an assortmentof bars and restaurants, populated with those considered to have unsavory reputa-tions and appetites. In keeping with the histories of other North American LGBTneighborhoods, Toronto’s post-war homosexual population clustered in and aroundthese less desirable areas, able to live relatively open lives among other marginalizedgroups in the Bloor and Church Street district (Egan 1998).In the post-World War II period, City of Toronto planning policies were directedlargely toward the inner suburbs surrounding the city of Toronto. Such efforts weredriven by a deep desire to return to pre-war norms about the heterosexual family andchildren. Developers and planners stressed the notion that raising a family requiredsingle family homeownership,with greater indoor and outdoor space (Bunting, Filionand Walker 2010; Hernandez, Robinson and Larson 2010). Governments directlyintervened to encourage such developments through the provision of subsidizedschools, hospitals, housing, and the construction of roads andmajor arterial highways(Bunting, Filion and Walker 2010).In Toronto, the boom in the suburban developments undermined inner-city neigh-borhoods as the middle and upper classes moved to the suburbs, encouraging theconstruction of major roadways through older downtown neighborhoods. Inner-cityhousing stockdeclined as larger homeswere converted tomultiple-unit rentals, along-side its physical deterioration, which supported planning initiatives for urban renewaland the demolition of older housing stock for public housing (Miron 1993). Toronto’sgays and lesbians were unlikely to live in the newly developing suburbs, therebyencouraging many to live and work in the downtown core where their proclivitiesweremore likely to be tolerated.Canadian cities (includingToronto) also experiencedsubstantial immigration in the 1950s and 1960s, which supported the refurbishmentof inner-city housing stock as ethnic minorities began to concentrate in recognizabledistricts or territories.By the early 1970s, Toronto experienced local social movements pushing backagainst the state and promoting vibrant low-rise, eclectic inner-city neighborhoods(Searle and Filion 2010; Sewell 1993; Walks 2008). As the city embraced theseideas, the downtown experienced “a wave of heritage protection and the begin-nings of inner-city gentrification in the early 1970s” (Lynch and Ley 2010: 330).Neighborhood preservationist movements were particularly successful in pushingback against development, prompting a shift in Canadian planning perspectives toone that increasingly regarded the downtown core as an important hub for regional11 Recovering the Gay Village: A Comparative … 247economic health, the provision of goods and services, and a center for social andcultural life (Hernandez, Robinson and Larson 2010).11.3.1 A Nascent Gay Village: Toronto in the 1970sThe partial decriminalization of homosexuality in 1969 opened up possibilities formore public activism. LGBT political and social organizations were founded indowntown Toronto in the early 1970s. The Community Homophile Association ofToronto (CHAT) established a community center, cafe, and library in the ChurchStreet area. CHATbelieved such spaceswould bring together and politicize local gaysand lesbians by providing alternative spaces alongside the bars and bathhouses (Nash2006). Clashes with anti-gay activists, including Anita Bryant and local pastor KenCampbell, as well as organizing against police harassment of bathhouses, fosteredfurther political activism geared toward defending homosexual commercial estab-lishments. By the end of the 1970s, gay and lesbian activists fully recognized theChurch and Wellesley Street area as a gay neighborhood and called for its defense,not only by gays and lesbians but also by the localmunicipal council. In 1980, GeorgeHislop ran as the first openly gay candidate for City Council.In the background, the election of a City of Toronto “reform” council in 1969prompted calls to endmajor urban renewal projects and to protect and preserve inner-city neighborhoods. As a result of postmodern strategies of place-making (Lynch andLey 2010: 311), ethnocultural neighborhoods were no longer perceived as temporarylocations from which to aspire to assimilation but as stable and supportive commu-nities contributing to the vibrancy of city life. Taken together, the new urban socialmovements, the development of stable ethnic enclaves, and the growing gay andlesbian rights movement encouraged an understanding of the Church and WellesleyStreet neighborhood as one worth protecting as a legitimate political and socialterritory for gays and lesbians to participate in city life (Nash 2006).Simultaneously, awider shift in perceptions about urban life sawgrowing numbersof single women, single men, and childless couples enjoyed downtown residentiallifestyles, fueling incipient gentrification (Bitterman 2021). Scholars have docu-mented the important role that gay men and lesbians played as early gentrifiers inmarginal locations in Toronto, including the impact of gay men in the Cabbagetownneighborhood adjacent to the nascent gay village in the early 1970s (Bouthillette1994).11.3.2 Neoliberalism and Toronto’s Gay VillageIn the 1990s, Canadian cities, including Toronto, experienced increasing financialstrain as the Ontario provincial and federal governments began shifting the costsof welfare and social programs, and infrastructure repair and management, to local248 A. Gorman-Murray and C. J. Nashmunicipalities. In response, cities increasingly employed more entrepreneurial, self-promotional approaches to attract new economic development. Neoliberal ideologiesunderpinned cities’ endeavors to market themselves through the creation of placeidentities, edgy architecture, urban design, and cultural spectacle (Lynch and Ley2010). City authorities understood the importance of “place-making” in creating apositive city image, making them magnets for employment, industry, and tourism.By the early 2000s, Toronto’s gay village (as with other gay villages in NorthAmerica, Europe and Australia) was fully incorporated into the fabric of the post-industrial entrepreneurial city that knitted together commodified, consumer-basedneighborhoods with downtown urban lifestyles (Binnie and Skeggs 2004; Nash2013a, b). In amanner similar to other locations in the Global North, the gay village’sincorporation into commodified urban landscapes is a reflection in part of the aspira-tions of some gay men and lesbians for inclusion in a neoliberal politics that resultsin the privileging of some gay men and lesbians who desire to live within middleclass, gender-normative, monogamous coupledom—a form of homonormalization(Duggan 2003).11.3.3 Toronto’s Village TodayToday, Toronto’s village is unequivocally included as one of the distinctive inner-cityneighborhoods in the city’s marketing and tourism activities. But recently, anxietyabout its possible decline has grown, particularly with the loss of several iconic busi-nesses, rising rents, and an influx of heterosexuals into the condominium marketand entertainment venues. There are also claims that younger queers view the gayvillage as a relic of the past or a location that was never particularly welcomingof certain groups (Nash 2013b). Simultaneously, legislative and social advances,including human rights protections and same-sex marriage, mean that LGBT peopleare increasingly visible across a variety of locations. Other Torontonian neighbor-hoods supporting queer communities include Parkdale (“Queer West”), BrocktonVillage, Roncesvalles, and Leslieville. Our research suggests that rather than under-standing changing gendered and sexual landscapes as manifestations of decline, it ismore suitable to understand them as shifting relational geographies between neigh-borhoods, manifesting broader queer visibility and greater social cohesion (Nash andGorman-Murray 2014).Recently, the village has been presented with an opportunity for self-reflectionin the wake of Toronto’s successful bids for World Pride, held Spring 2014, and thePan-American Games, held Summer 2015. Preparing for these events provided thelocal LGBT business community with an opportunity to undertake more long-rangeplanning around the future of the gay village and its role in LGBT and queer life.The Church andWellesley Village Business Improvement Association (BIA) wascreated in 2002.BIAspool funds from local businesses to undertake projects designedto “improve, beautify and maintain public lands in the BIA and promote the area forbusiness and shopping” (Government of Ontario 2001: 204). The BIA formed a close11 Recovering the Gay Village: A Comparative … 249association with the LGBT community, and following the successful World Prideand PanAm bids, the BIA and LGBT activists, with the support of Councilor KristynWong-Tam, launched a planning study to determine the future direction of the gayvillage. Partly as a result of the planning study, the BIA undertook several initiativesto preserve the long-term economic viability of the village as a tourist attraction,including renovatingCawartha Park, commissioning amural representingLGBT life,and opening “temporary parklets” along Church Street (Nash and Gorman-Murray2019b).Although the process is ongoing, it is possible to see the institution of particularnarratives about the centrality and importance of the village for LGBT and queerpeople. This means, in part, a re-visioning of the village as a “place of arrival andreturn,” as a place for people to come out, and as a place for LGBT and queer peopleto gather for political and social protest.11.4 Historical Geographies of Sexuality in SydneyWe now discuss historical geographies of sexuality in Sydney, with attention to theemergence, development, and decline of the gay village around Oxford Street. Thisdiscussion picks up the three foundational themes—planning, neighborhood, andneoliberalism—and elicits Sydney’s similarities and differences in comparison withToronto, suggesting how and why these villages are developing in distinctive ways.Sydney is the oldest city in modern Australia, founded in 1788when the colony (laterstate) of New SouthWales (NSW) was established, and is Australia’s primary globalcity. The immediate post-World War II era was a period of sustained population andeconomic growth. As part of the post-war rebuilding, federal and state governments’plans for economic and social development relied on policies encouraging populationgrowth through natural increase and state-sponsored immigration. These policieswere implicitly heteronormative, encouraging sexual and social reproduction throughnuclear family units, realized in a “baby boom.”Such heteronormative policy was explicit in urban planning processes and prac-tices in Sydney (Gorman-Murray 2011; Prior 2008). Increased population meant aneed for increased housing, and state and private housing organizations, financialinstitutions, and land developers geared new suburban estates and “home packages”toward heterosexual nuclear families (Game and Pringle 1979; Johnson 2000).Whilethe expanding Sydney suburbs were planned as sites of heteronormative family life,the inner city was seen as undesirable for residential development and more suited toindustrial and commercial activities. In contrast with “familial” suburbia, nighttimeinner-city Sydney was imagined as a site of vice and immorality, best seen in theclubs, prostitution, and crime associated with the red-light district in the inner eastsuburb of King’s Cross (Johnson 2000; Dunn 2011).It was in such liminal inner-city spaces that Sydney’s gay and lesbian subculturesemerged, which historians suggest were more concentrated and visible than in otherAustralian cities (Wotherspoon 1991). However, the sites of that subculture—clubs,250 A. Gorman-Murray and C. J. Nashbars, cafes, baths—were transient, underground venues that shifted across Sydney’sinner city, from the CBD to East Sydney, King’s Cross, and Paddington, liable tosocial retribution and police raids (Wotherspoon 1991). However, the late 1960sbrought public homosexual rights claims and murmurings of social acceptance insome liberal quarters, enabling enhanced visibility in the name of social and legalchange (Willett 2000b). In the late 1960s a cluster of more visible gay clubs (e.g.,Ivy’s Birdcage, Capriccio’s) settled on Oxford Street, and “from the early 1970s itwas theOxfordStreet area that became the focus for gay venues” (Wotherspoon 1991:19). Amidst the mobile, relational geographies of the post-war period, the confluenceof rights, politics, incremental social change, and an incipient geographical anchorprovided the material foundation for a gay village in Sydney, centered on OxfordStreet, eventually known by that same moniker (Fig. 11.5).Fig. 11.5 Oxford Street, Darlinghurst, Sydney, 2019 (Source Image by Andrew Gorman-Murray)11 Recovering the Gay Village: A Comparative … 25111.4.1 Consolidation of a Gay Neighborhood: Sydneyin the 1970s to the 1990sThe consolidation of Oxford Street as a gay area occurred quickly, with fractionsof the gay community inspired by gay neighborhoods emerging in San Francisco’sCastro and Los Angeles’s West Hollywood (Wotherspoon 1991). Building on thefoundation of the successful late 1960s bars, there was a rapid emergence of venuesaround Oxford Street, which became a locus for clubs, bars, baths, sex-on-premisesvenues, and bookshops. The clustering generated a “gravitational effect,” drawinga gay residential population to the surrounding suburbs Darlinghurst, Surry Hills,Paddington, and Potts Point (Fig. 11.4). Of course, gay men and lesbians had livedin the inner city earlier, given the relatively cheap cost of accommodation in theseundesirable areas, but the late 1960s saw the beginning of inner-city housing gentri-fication. Within a short period, a discrete geographical area had emerged as a site of“gay identity” in both commercial and residential terms (Knopp 1998). As Wother-spoon (1991: 193) argues, “there was now a definite area where the new ‘gay’ mancould feel at home, in territory that was clearly stamped in his image.” The villageconsolidated further across the 1970s and 1980s. During these decades, gay pressoffices proliferated; gay rights groups relocated to the neighborhood; health servicesaimed at gay clientele moved in (GPs, dentists, counselors, and HIV/AIDS services);and services for gay youth (Twenty10) or religious gays (Metropolitan CommunityChurch) were established (Ruting 2008).Oxford Street’s development has entailed successes and failures. One of the fail-ings of its ad hoc consolidation was the attention of services to gay men and thedisplacement of lesbian services and residents. With gentrification, lesbians, oftenwith less financial means than gay men, were priced out of the housing market,while services aimed at lesbians and other queer women were similarly affectedby increasing commercial rents. This contributed to the development of a discretelesbian residential and service neighborhood during the 1980s in the inner westsuburb Leichhardt (Murphy and Watson 1997; Nash and Gorman-Murray 2015).Women’s health services, lesbian counseling services, women’s refuges, women’sand lesbians’ social and business clubs, and lesbian residents began to congregatein the suburb, earning it the moniker “Dykehardt.” However, this was also a lossto Oxford Street and its local sexual and gender diversity, which remains largelyassociated with gay men.The consolidation ofOxford Street as “gay territory” also yielded distinct benefits.The spatial concentration of gay commerce, organizations, and residents providedpolitical strength for securing rights claims—a “concentrated voice” that impelledNSW anti-discrimination laws (1982) and the decriminalization of homosexuality(1984). Parallel with such changes in NSWparliament, a geographical hub for LGBTcommunity organizations and leadership (and commercial and sex venues, and resi-dents) allowed for a coordinated, joint response from the state and the gay commu-nity to HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s, generating one of the most effective responsesglobally, targeting safer sex messages at the gay community, keeping infection rates252 A. Gorman-Murray and C. J. Nashrelatively low (c. 14/100,000 people cf. 167/100,000 in the United States) (Willett2011). The local government (City of Sydney Council) and representatives for theNSW electorate have consistently championed LGBT causes.The neighborhood has been an economic success too, highlighted by the SydneyGay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival, a month-long LGBT festival incorporating afamous parade along Oxford Street, dance parties, a film festival, and cultural andsporting events. The parade has been held annually since 1978, initiated as a localresponse supporting Stonewall Day. Since then, the Mardi Gras Festival has becomean international tourist event supported by the NSW government and the City ofSydney Council, earning up to A$90 million per annum (Waitt and Markwell 2006).11.4.2 An End to Village Life in Sydney?Yet the early twenty-first century has witnessed stories of the Oxford Street’s declinein the LGBT and mainstream press, the closure of iconic venues and the move-ment of many LGBT organizations elsewhere in the inner city, alongside the notableincrease in “straight” nightclubs (Gorman-Murray 2006; Ruting 2008; Reynolds2007, 2009). Researchers suggest several reasons for this decline as a gay locale,including increasing straight residents (and venues) due to the “cultural cache” ofthe gay village; rising rents pricing out gay residents and businesses; and onlinenetworks, reducing the need for a spatial concentration of social venues. The commer-cial strip has shifted toward a nightlife focus, with a preponderance of nightclubsand a diminishing number of cafes, restaurants, and retail outlets.This decline has been challenged for diverse political and economic reasons.Middle-aged and older men, and generations of activists, remember Oxford Streetas a site of political developments, coming out and social life, and seek to hold ontothis well-known territory for themselves and future generations. The City of SydneyCouncil seeks to sustain the political and economic success of Oxford Street, incor-porating it into its neoliberal “city-marketing” strategy—the “City of Villages”—asan internationally renowned “gay village.” To this end, the City of Sydney Councilhas instituted a series of strategies and plans aimed at reducing the problems facingthe gay village and recuperating its perceived gay character (Reynolds 2009). Theseinclude the establishment of “safe space” along the street and initiatives to re-occupythe street with “daytime” creative enterprises by offering low-rent or rent-free shopfronts to artists and pop-up stores. These neoliberal strategies attempt to rebuild abroader local commercial base, enticing citizen-consumers back.The perceived decline in Oxford Street since the early 2000s has been matchedby the development of another LGBT neighborhood in Sydney’s inner west,centered on King Street, Newtown (Fig. 11.6), with a residential spread intothe surrounding suburbs of Camperdown, Erskineville, Enmore, St. Peters, andMarrickville (Fig. 11.4), which has been proffered by the LGBT media and localresidents as a new LGBT heartland of Sydney (Gorman-Murray 2006; Gorman-Murray and Waitt 2009). There are increasing LGBT and LGBT-friendly venues11 Recovering the Gay Village: A Comparative … 253Fig. 11.6 King Street, Newtown, Sydney, 2020, with The Bank Hotel flying LGBT flags (righthand side of the street) (Source Image by Andrew Gorman-Murray)(e.g., The Imperial, Newtown, and Bank Hotels), while several LGBT organizationshave moved in (e.g., Twenty10, the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations,a Metropolitan Community Church congregation, and the Gay and Lesbian Coun-selling Service). Significantly, there are venues and organizations that cater for theLBT in LGBT. The area is home to The Gender Centre, the key NSW advocacyservice for trans and genderqueer rights. Much of Sydney’s lesbian social scene canbe found in local venues (e.g., The Imperial, Bank, and Sly Fox hotels).While Oxford Street is typically understood as a gay male space, Newtown andthe inner west are seen to provide a home for a broader sexual and gender demo-graphic, including lesbians, queer women, and trans people. The Australian Census2011 found that the ten suburbs with the highest concentration of male and femalesame-sex coupleswere in inner-city Sydney, butwhilemale couples aremost concen-trated in Darlinghurst, Surry Hills, and Potts Point in the inner east, female couples254 A. Gorman-Murray and C. J. Nashare concentrated in Newtown, St. Peters, Enmore, Erskineville, and Marrickvillein the inner west, alongside still significant concentrations of male couples. Thecombination of residential concentrations of female and male couples, as well as acongregation of LGBT commercial venues and organizational services since 2000,indicates the presence of a LGBT neighborhood in Sydney’s inner west. While somesuggest that this challenges the continuance of Oxford Street, others contend that theinner west caters to a different LGBT demographic—one perhaps more inclusive ofsexual and gender diversity than the “traditional” gay (male) ghetto.11.5 Thoughts on Historical Legacies and the Futureof the Gay VillageWe argue that the distinct historical geographies of the Church-Wellesley andOxfordStreet gay villages help to position each differently within the urban fabric of, respec-tively, Toronto and Sydney. These different historical geographies and urban lega-cies enable (perhaps) divergent futures. Toronto’s Church-Wellesley village nowfinds itself in a more hopeful set of circumstances in terms of determining its futurevis-à-vis Sydney’s Oxford Street. The use of the “ethnic” model of territorial iden-tity in Church-Wellesley village arguably benefitted from an earlier recognition andincorporation of “other” ethnic differences in processes of political inclusion, culturalheritage, andurbanplanning than inSydney.Thevillage’s location, initiallymarginal,benefitted from being close to Yonge Street when the city began rejecting urbanrenewal planning and instead embraced inner-city preservation.The drive to preserve heritage, difference, and unique neighborhoods emergedmuch later in Sydney, not taking hold until the 1990s. Since then, in Sydney aswell as Toronto, the local city councils have incorporated their “gay villages” into“city of neighborhoods” discourses, aimed at boosting initiatives around creativeindustries, marketing, and tourism by commodifying the diversity, cosmopolitanism,and lifestyle of the inner city. But there has been a difference here between Torontoand Sydney, arguably resulting from the earlier recognition of Church-Wellesley asa unique neighborhood. Even as the City of Sydney Council rolled out its “City ofVillages” campaign in the early 2000s, Oxford Street was not identified as the onlygay village in Sydney. Already by the early 2000s, the City of Sydneywas identifyingNewtown andErskineville, which liewithin its jurisdictional boundaries, as other gayspaces in the inner city alongside Oxford Street. Since that time, Oxford Street hascontinued to decline materially and imaginatively as the gay village within Sydney,while Newtown and the inner west have continued to solidify as queer neighborhoods(Gorman-Murray and Nash 2014, 2017; Gorman-Murray and Waitt 2009).As a result of the different political and territorial legacies of Church-Wellesleyand Oxford Street, it seems that late 2000s discourses about the deterioration of gayvillages arguably promoted debates about the preservation and future of Church-Wellesley before it reached the state of decline being experienced by Oxford Street.11 Recovering the Gay Village: A Comparative … 255Indeed, the village evinces a strong institutional base in the form of 519 Church, theBIA, and a lesbian-identified city councilor dedicated to the economic and socialhealth of the area. These institutions are taking advantage of high-profile events suchasWorld Pride and the PanAmGames for self-reflection and to “rebuild” the territoryand identity of the village as central in the lives of new generations of LGBT andqueer people. This is not to say that such attempts have not beenmade around OxfordStreet. However, we have suggested, the particular historical geography of OxfordStreet has yielded specific pressures and fewer opportunities to stabilize its territoryand identity.For instance, there are some quite geographical issues concerning the locationand physical affordance of Oxford Street and its connection with Sydney’s down-town core. The Church-Wellesley Village is located downtown, and has benefittedfrom being in Toronto’s core, near the Eaton Centre, iconic Maple Leaf Gardens,refurbished Dundas Square, and Ryerson University, a location central to urbanregeneration schemes. Oxford Street, however, is one suburb east of Sydney’s CBDand separated by parkland, a seemingly minor difference but consequential for itsintegration in urban change. The significant regeneration of Sydney’s CBD that hastaken place since the 1980s has focused on the northern (Circular Quay, The Rocks)andwestern sides (DarlingHarbour, Barangaroo) of the city core, with the east (HydePark, East Sydney, and Oxford Street) receiving less attention. Oxford Street itself isnot a place for sightseeing and daytime leisure vis-à-vis refurbished Circular Quay,Darling Harbour, Barangaroo, and The Rocks.The changes in Oxford Street’s business profile, its disconnection from the CBD,and the movement of the city’s core toward the west, while not “causing” thedevelopment of Newtown as a queer neighborhood, have arguably helped facili-tate changing LGBT spaces and networks. In Toronto, however, given its specifichistorical geographies and affordances, the Church-Wellesley village seems to beregrouping and rebranding with some success, partly due to current opportunitieswith local businesses and politicians who are committed to the village and takingadvantage of upcoming hallmark events. The Church-Wellesley village arrives atthis point in time with similar pressures as Oxford Street in terms of rising rents,changing demographics, and the use of social media apps leading to a downturn inclientele (Miles 2021). Yet it is also quite differently incorporated into the urbanfabric—both the downtown core and other neighborhoods—enabling opportunitiesto proactively write a narrative in response to changes and draw on resources tostabilize itself. While there are alternative neighborhoods emerging, such as QueerWest and Leslieville, they are not materialized in the relational geographies of LGBTlandscapes in the way Newtown has become embedded as a queer neighborhood inSydney, with a distinct profile connected with but contesting Oxford Street.256 A. Gorman-Murray and C. J. Nash11.6 Concluding Remarks: Wider Implications for UrbanPlanning and PolicyWhat implications might these historical geographies have for urban planners andlocal governments? On the one hand, the mutable geographies of LGBT and queerspaces might prompt a call for “remembering” and “fixing” certain sites (venues,neighborhoods) “identified” as LGBT or queer. On the other hand, this same muta-bility should also alert planners and policy-makers to the reality that LGBT and queerlives and spaces cannot be readily “fixed” in place. Arguably, part of the geographicalheritage of these communities is their mobility—even if this is, at the same time,the result of physical constraints on social marginality. This means that planners andpolicy-makers must be aware of at least two important realizations. First, LGBT andqueer communities are diverse, not singular, encompassing differences of gender,ethnicity, generation, class, etc., all of which need to be attended to in planning andpolicy to meet the wide needs and aspirations of these communities. Second, it is notonly “identified” LGBT and queer places that must accommodate sexual and genderdiversity: all spaces need to be inclusive of LGBT and queer lives.We see these two dimensions of planning—acknowledging specific geographicalheritage and building broad spatial inclusion—as complementary. Remembering(possibly reclaiming) significant LGBT and queer urban spaces provides importantmoorings for these communities in the face of mutable geographies. But it is equallyimportant to be cognizant of how urban spaces are constantly reconfigured andutilized in differentways in response to shifting gender and sexual subjectivities. Thisbehooves planners and policy-makers to develop sensitivity to the changing spatialimperatives of LGBT and queer people, and to accommodate these mobile lives inplanning to ensure the ongoing strength and sustainability of these communities.Acknowledgment This chapter originated as an article in the open-access journalHistorical Geog-raphy (2015, 43: 84–105), which has been substantially re-worked for publication in this editedvolume.

Doan and Ozlem AtalayAbstract Many gay villages (or “gayborhoods”) arose in the wake of the gay liber-ation movement attracted a good deal of academic research within the last 40 years.Unfortunately, this hyper focus on certain spaces often populated by white gay menhas frequently eclipsed research on other types of LGBTQ areas as well as othergeographies beyond the global north. This chapter aims to address this gap, takingan ordinary cities perspective (Robinson, 2006) and asking how we can developmodels that are conceptually useful for understanding the life of a more diversearray of LGBTQ spaces across the globe. To answer this question we avoid linearmodels of change by developing a new model based on a conceptual frameworkderived from physics: centripetal and centrifugal forces. The advantage of this modelis its explicit recognition of the ways that social, economic, and political forces andtheir manifestations influence queer spaces. We use two cases from relatively under-studied regions; Atlanta and Istanbul to illustrate the utility of this framework. The“in-betweenness” of these cities, linking south and north as well as west and east,makes them a haven for queers and others fleeing the conservative surroundings inthe search for more attractive and welcoming places for marginalized LGBTQ indi-viduals. This chapter draws on the authors’ lived experiences, prior research, andadditional interviews to conduct a relational reading of queer spaces with emphasison the ways that LGBTQ people circulate and congregate in a wider range of urbanareas. This comparative strategy and relational reading of queer spaces expands thenarrow focus from normalized narratives of gayborhoods to a broader “analysis ofthe heterogeneity and multiplicity of metropolitan modernities” (Roy 2009, p. 821)of queer spaces.Co-editors Alex Bitterman, Alfred State University of New York, USADaniel Baldwin Hess, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, USAThe Life and Afterlife of Gay Neighborhoods: Resurgence and RenaissanceP.

AtalayKeywords Queer spaces · Gayborhoods · Atlanta · Istanbul · Centripetal andcentrifugal forces12.1 IntroductionThe most iconic gay villages (or “gayborhoods”) that arose in the wake of the gayliberation movement have attracted the lion’s share of academic research; other (seefor example the introduction to this volume that cites Greenwich Village, NY, WestHollywood in Los Angeles, South Beach in Miami, Dupont Circle in Washington,DC, and the Castro in San Francisco as well as Oxford Street in London, Churchand Wellesley in Toronto, le Marais in Paris, and the Schöneberg District in Berlin).Other LGBTQ neighborhoods in smaller cities both in the West as well as mostcities in the Global South have received much less attention. Furthermore, lesbianshave not received equal attention (cf. Valentine 1993; Podmore 2006), and trans-gender individuals even less (cf. Namaste 2000; Doan 2007; Nash 2010). In addi-tion, the overwhelming whiteness of these large metropolitan neighborhoods hasbeen noted widely (Nero 2005; Greene 2014). In order to study the life and afterlifeof a more diverse array of LGBTQ spaces, in this chapter we take an “ordinary cities”perspective as suggested by Robinson (2006), by adopting an explicitly post-colonialapproach and arguing “that there is potential for learning from the experiences andaccounts of urban life in even quite different cities” (Robinson 2006: 41).We have selected two cities, Atlanta and Istanbul, from relatively under-studiedregions that provide us with opportunities to explore differences in the ways LGBTQpeople find safety in urban areas, one city with a clearly defined gay neighborhoodand the other without. One city happens to be located in the American South and theother forms a physical bridge between Europe and Asia. Both cities are surroundedby wide areas that are not at all welcoming of LGBTQ people and have served ashubs that attract a variety of LGBTQ individuals from across their respective regions.In this chapter we use evidence from these two cities derived from the authors’ livedexperiences, prior research, and additional interviews to develop amore generalizableapproach that incorporates the range of forces that influence the rise and decline (Lifeand afterlife) of LGBTQ spaces, including gay villages. We utilize a frameworkderived from basic physics concepts, centripetal and centrifugal forces, followinga long tradition in social sciences of “borrowing” from other disciplines that hasyielded key urban theory concepts such as the gravity model and the friction ofdistance.Both of our chosen cities, Atlanta and Istanbul, share a cosmopolitan urban imag-inary rooted in their intersectional geographies. Atlanta is an historically “southern”city, sometimes called the epitome of the New South. Its modern growth has beenfueled by many northern transplants, making it a complex city blending elements ofboth the American North and South. Istanbul is physically located on the BosphorusStrait that separates Europe from Asia, providing a setting that merges Europe (theWest) with the Middle East and Asia (the East or the Orient). The “in-betweenness”12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 263of these cities linking south and north as well as west and east makes them a havenfor queers and others fleeing the conservative surroundings in the search for moreattractive and welcoming places for marginalized LGBTQ individuals. In addition,these cities share a multicultural and ethnically diverse population base. As such, this“northern-southern” city and this “western-eastern” city provide a useful relationalreading of queer spaces with emphasis on the ways that LGBTQ people circulate andcongregate in a wider range of urban areas. This comparative strategy utilized in arelational reading of queer spaces expands the narrow focus from normalized narra-tives of gayborhoods to a broader “analysis of the heterogeneity and multiplicity ofmetropolitan modernities” (Roy 2009: 821) of queer spaces.12.2 Centripetal and Centrifugal ForcesCase-based economic descriptions of gayborhoods in large metropolitan areas havebeen used to elaborate linear “models” that suggest gay villages progress frommarginal areas to emergent neighborhoods, which then expand and diversify, andfinally are re-integrated into society (Collins 2004). However, other scholars havesuggested that the integration stage marking the decline of traditional gayborhoodsmight be linked to a “post gay” (Ghaziani 2014) or “post mo” (Nash 2013) iden-tity that has shifted the fundamental chemistry of queer spaces. Other scholars havesuggested that the symbolic value of queer spaces remains extremely salient. Forexample, Lewis (2015) described the ways that many gay men can no longer affordto live in Dupont Circle, the traditional gay area of Washington DC, but still returnto the bars and shops of the area to find community. Similarly, Greene (2014) usedthe concept of “vicarious citizenship” to explain how certain LGBT populationscontinue to find gay neighborhoods symbolically essential to their sense of iden-tity and community despite evidence signaling the decline of these spaces (Greene2014: 103). More recently, Ghaziani proposed a more expansive notion of culturalarchipelagos (2019), incorporating a spatial plurality that better reflects a broaderrange of queer spaces. In a similar vein, Doan (2019) argued that a planetary systemsmodel might capture the ways in which gay villages serve as “mini suns” aroundwhich LGBTQ individuals orbit.This chapter builds on this prior work by emphasizing the way the LGBTQ peopleare both drawn to and pushed away fromqueer urban spaces.Wepropose a conceptualframework that identifies both centering (centripetal) and decentering (centrifugal)forces that operate at a variety of scales from the individual to the neighborhood, cityand national levels. It is the interplay between these broader socio-political influencesthat creates a unique signature for each LGBTQ space analyzed, providing for amore generalizable approach that might apply across different sizes of cities, variouscultural and ethnic areas, and a wider array of geographies.In general, centripetal forces (see Fig. 12.1) exert inward pressure to a centralpoint or area. In the case of gayborhoods, these “forces” attract LGBTQ people andbusinesses toward the center. These “forces” might include a more progressive and264 P. L. Doan and O. AtalayFig. 12.1 Centripetal forces (Source Diagram by authors)tolerant reputation of a city drawing LGBTQ individuals from a wider regional areathat is less accepting, i.e., Kath Weston’s (1995) “Get thee to a big city” conceptor pulling people to a particular neighborhood that is more welcoming than otherparts of a city or wider region. The longing for safe space where queer people canexpress their identities and love for their partners openly is also a very powerfuldraw. In addition, there are cultural dimensions that influence the ways that indi-viduals conceptualize themselves in terms of identity, belonging, experiences ofmarginalization, and religion that may influence their ability to express agency in theface of these forces (Butcher and Maclean 2018).The availability of affordable rental opportunities and/or residential investmentproperties also invites new residents to move in, contributing to a critical mass ofqueer people. Bars, bookstores, and other opportunities for socializing also pullqueer folks toward the center. Finally, a sense of “place” and an interesting builtenvironment also can serve as attractors.However, to fully understand the life and afterlife of gayborhoods, we must alsoconsider those centrifugal forces (see Fig. 12.2) that cause LGBTQ people to moveaway from the center. The rising cost of housing makes it harder (if not impossible)for new queer residents to settle in established gayborhoods. In addition, in the after-math of the dissolution of same sex marriages/partnerships either through divorce orthrough the death of one partner (especially relevant in the aftermath of HIV), moreexpensive housing can make it impossible for one or both partners to financiallyremain in the existing queer space. Changes in the overall atmosphere of the builtenvironment due to large-scale redevelopment can alter the urban fabric in ways thatincrease isolation, reduce the sense of safety, and the feeling of belonging in theneighborhood. A component of this change is the increasing presence of non-queerfolks and families who may not understand or approve of some of the more overtly12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 265Fig. 12.2 Centrifugal forces (Source Diagram by authors)queer aspects of life in the gayborhood (Pride parades, late nights at gay bars, publicdisplays of affection, etc.).We use two disparate cases to illustrate the utility of this framework. The caseof Atlanta in the American Southeast represents a more typical story of gayborhooddevelopment in its Midtown neighborhood. We supplement this experience with theless well-studied case of Istanbul, representing a different geographic, social, andpolitical context.12.3 Midtown, AtlantaThe city of Atlanta provides a set of fascinating contrasts as the birthplace of bothMargaret Mitchell and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Mitchell’s 1936 novel Gone withtheWind depicts the complex lives of white society during and after the CivilWar andis still revered by some people who mourn the loss of a southern identity idealizingScarlett O’Hara and her not so idyllic life on Tara Plantation. At the same timeKing’sgravesite and the adjacent Ebenezer Baptist Church where he preached are now apowerfulmuseum thatmemorializes his life and the struggles of other blackAtlantansin the civil rights movement. Atlanta has evolved into a city of contrasts where “twolargely separate cities: a mostly white north side of town, where economic activityis vigorous and expanding, and a mostly black south side” that is divided betweenthe very poor and a thriving black middle class (Keating 2001: 8) (Fig. 12.3).Midtown is located just north of downtown at the southern edge of the mostlywhite northern parts of Atlanta. Although Midtown attracted gay men as early as thelate 1950s for cruising at the public library and in nearby Piedmont Park (Howard1997), it wasn’t until white elites abandoned this neighborhood in favor of more266 P. L. Doan and O. AtalayFig. 12.3 Sketch map of Midtown, Atlanta (Source Map by authors)modern suburbs (Kruse 2005), that gay men began moving into what had become avery sketchy area. The neighborhood was “largely restored by gays” who moved inand began fixing up some of the area’s Craftsman Style homes (Pendered 2003). Agay bookstore, Outwrite Books, and a number of gay bars opened in the vicinity andhelped to create a burgeoning gay community. By the 1990s Midtown was widelyrecognized as the center of gay life in Atlanta and nearby Piedmont Park was the12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 267Fig. 12.4 Typical craftsman bungalow in Midtown, Atlanta (Source Image by authors)location for gay Pride events, becoming a focal point that attracted LGBTQ peoplefrom across the Deep South (Fig. 12.4).12.3.1 Centripetal Forces in the Atlanta CaseAtlanta is located in the middle of the region called the Bible Belt known for itsconservative family values and high levels of intolerance for LGBTQ individuals.Charley Brown, the hostess of a fabulous drag show at the now shuttered Backstreetnightclub in Atlanta, used to divide the south into two zones, inside the Atlantabeltway (I-285) and outside the perimeter (OTP). The OTP region was often the buttof her jokes as the home of tractor pulls and rural intolerance. This harsh attitudeencouraged many queer folks from across the southeast to leave home and seek theanonymity of the big city inAtlantawhere theydiscoveredoneof themost progressivelocations in a region stretching from New Orleans to Miami Beach (Lewis 2006).This powerful inwardmigrationwas part of the regional centripetal force that spurredthe development of Atlanta’s Midtown.[T]he strong presence of evangelicals appears to create a climate in which Southernersoppose lesbian andgay rightsmore strongly thandemographically, religiously, andpoliticallycomparable Americans in the rest of the country. (Lewis and Galope 2014: 293) (Fig. 12.5)268 P. L. Doan and O. AtalayFig. 12.5 Backstreet Nightclub in Midtown, Atlanta (Source Image by authors)Yet Atlanta also attracted some transplants from theNorth, although some of thesemigrants struggled to understand its complexity. In one interview a lesbian couplenoted that stereotypes of the South as a home to rednecks must be carefully temperedby Atlanta’s unique atmosphere.….. when we first moved here, there were people who would come in from rural Georgia,to come into the big city to do errands that they needed to do… let’s put it this way. I grewup in Connecticut. Whatever anybody tells you, we got rednecks. They are a whole lot morethreatening, and not nearly as polite as the rednecks in Georgia. (interview with a lesbian,Nancy)Yeah, rednecks may beat you up here, but they’ll be polite with you until they do? I thinkit’s…I think it’s a Southern thing,… And the longer I live in the South, the more realize12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 269I don’t understand the South, not having grown up here. (interview with Nancy’s partnerEvelyn)Furthermore, the relatively tolerant attitude of city officials to the gay bar sceneenabled an attractive cluster of gay bars and clubs to emerge, creating a centripetalforce that drew LGBTQ people to the neighborhood and city. In 1966 Atlanta had 6gay bars (Lewis 2006: 6), but over the next three decades many other venues opened(notable gay attractants were Backstreet, the Armory, WETBar, Burkhart’s, Blake’son the Park, Bulldogs, and the Metro video bar). Lesbian bars also were located inthe Midtown area, first the Other Side and subsequently My Sister’s Room. Othergay bathhouses and gay-oriented businesses located in the Midtown and the adjacentCheshire Bridge area also appealed to both new residents and visitors from the widerregion (Fig. 12.6).12.3.2 Centrifugal Forces in the Atlanta CaseIn recent years rising rents and pressure from city government to rein in the exuberantlate-night life of the area causedmany gay clubs to close, paving the way for the rede-velopment of the Peachtree Street corridor (Doan and Higgins 2011). For example,during the 1990s as many as 17 establishments were located in Midtown, but by2011 there were only four LGBT businesses remaining (Adriaenssens 2011). Theseprominent bar closures contributed to the centrifugal forces that shifted gay resi-dential areas away from Midtown into more peripheral areas, such as East Atlanta,Decatur, and East Point.In 2012 the Outwrite Bookstore and Coffeeshop located at 10th and Piedmontwas sold by its owner. This iconic queer bookstore was a visible symbol of the queercommunity in Atlanta, and the owner of the store is clear that his decision to closethe bookstore was closely tied to the closing of the key gay bars.As the clubs closed, there were less people out on the street at night, making it, in someways,feel less safe. At the Outwrite, we could see a sharp decline in LGBT tourists who wouldcome to Atlanta on the weekend. Where the nightlife had been a major attraction to visitors,it now became less appealing and many of those tourists stopped visiting or shortened theirtrips.(Interview with Philip Rafshoon, March 2013, cited in Doan 2014) (Fig. 12.7)As Midtown redeveloped and more heterosexual neighbors began moving in, therewas significant resistance to the crowds and noise associated with gay bars, as wellas the very presence of their same sex patrons. Some of the social and culturalchanges brought by development included: new attitudes toward LGBTQ venuesand less tolerance for same sex partners. For instance, a member of the MidtownPonce Security Alliance (MPSA) indicated to a news reporter in 2004 that he would“do what he can to ensure Backstreet remains closed” (Henry 2004).270 P. L. Doan and O. AtalayFig. 12.6 Bulldogs in Midtown, Atlanta (Source Image by authors)Finally, rapid increases in population in Midtown created an excess of demandfor housing over its supply. While new housing investment is continuing, much ofthe new housing is in modern apartments and condominiums that are not nearly asaffordable as the older housing stock, especially for younger, more visibly queer,and ethnically diverse LGBTQ people.12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 271Fig. 12.7 Outwrite Bookstore in Midtown, Atlanta (Source Image by authors)272 P. L. Doan and O. AtalayWhen I moved in…. prices on my street were between, I’d say for a single family house, alow of 130 and a high of 200 and now on the same street, you have a low of 450 thousand anda high of 1.2 million. So that completely changes the type of person who can afford to buyin the neighborhood. It takes it from being just your average middle-class person, to being apartner in a law firm, a partner in an accounting firm, which…. (Interview with Roger, gayresident of Midtown)One effect of this intensification of gentrification has been that many of those whocan’t afford Midtown have begun seeking community in other areas. The followingquote fromone lesbian interviewee,Nancy, reflects the difficulties of finding housing.We ended up in Poncey Highlands, and then moved away for two years, and then movedback, and lived in Decatur…. there weren’t simple apartments that we could afford, so westarted looking…broadening our scope a little…. when we lived in Poncey Highlands, it wasa fairly transitional neighborhood at the time. And by the time we got back, I don’t know thatwe could have afforded anything in that area… So then we moved further out, to Decatur.(Interview with Nancy)Another lesbian couple Tamara and Katrina also had difficulty finding housing intheir price range, finally considered the suburbs outside the perimeter (OTP). Karenshared that “we have been experimenting with a little farther out, but I don’t want toget too far out. We looked at, what was it, Vernon, Marietta…. Roswell” (Interviewwith Karen).The current situation inMidtown reflects thismixture of centripetal and centrifugalforces. Although the residential character of Midtown has changed, with housingprices making it difficult for younger and poorer LGBT people to live there, severaliconic bars remain in Midtown and there is still a distinct gay vibe in a number ofrestaurants.Midtown’s 10th andPiedmont intersection remains the virtual heart of theLGBT community in Atlanta, a place where a more dispersed LGBTQ communitygathers to mourn or celebrate events in the wider political and social arena (Doan2019).12.4 Beyoglu, Istanbul, TurkeyIstanbul’s status as the place where East meets West has contributed to its predom-inant position within Turkey’s urban hierarchy. Its cosmopolitan character alongwith its respected education and abundant employment opportunities have alwaysattracted people from outer provinces. Beyoglu’s location at the center of Istanbulhas made it an attractive neighborhood with a welcoming orientation toward manycultures including LGBTQ individuals from across Turkey. Over the last 40 yearstwo sub-districts of Beyoglu, Cihangir and Tarlabasi, were especially notable fortheir affordable housing, diverse employment options, and multiple entertainmentvenues that attracted many people considered outcasts (Adaman and Keyder 2005;Selek 2001; Zengin 2014). The relatively permissive spaces of Beyoglu enabledLGBTQ individuals to carve out a space within which to live and work within the12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 273broader context of a patriarchal and conservative society (Arat and Nunez 2017;Engin and Pals 2018; Ozbay 2015; Selen 2012). The neighborhood’s narrow backstreets, parks, inexpensive bars, always popular hammams (bathhouses) as well asnumerous movie theaters provided many opportunities for interaction for queer andgender nonconforming populations. In addition, homes owned or rented by queerindividuals providedvenues for all-night parties aswell as solidaritymeetings (Atalayand Doan 2019a) (Fig. 12.8).The unique character of Beyoglu makes it difficult to compare to typical gaybor-hoods such as the Castro or Greenwich Village, since Beyoglu is not dominated bygay men. More precisely, Beyoglu presents a thought provoking case of an inclusiveand ephemeral queer space whose fluidity makes it less visible to outsiders (Erol2018; Gocer 2011). Yet, the queer spaces in the district have been challenged bychanges in the socio-economic conditions and the built environment over the pastFig. 12.8 Sketch map of Beyoglu and Kadikoy, Istanbul (Source Image by authors)274 P. L. Doan and O. Atalay30 years. To understand the particularities of these changes, we analyze the influenceof “centripetal and centrifugal forces” as they shape the lives of the queer community(Figs. 12.9 and 10.10).Fig. 12.9 Back streets of Beyoglu (Source Image by authors)12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 275Fig. 12.10 Stairs to Cihangir, Beyoglu (Source Image by authors)276 P. L. Doan and O. Atalay12.4.1 Centripetal Forces in the Istanbul CaseAlthough Article 10 of the Turkish Constitution promotes the idea of equality, sexualorientation and gender identity are not explicitly listed as protected classes (Engin2015; Muedini 2018). Not surprisingly, the lack of legal protection means the humanrights of LGBTQ individuals are often violated, especially in the areas of freedom ofassociation, employment, and housing (Muedini 2018). In addition, the religious andconservative identity of the nation is aligned with heteronormative values, therebymarginalizing same sex sexualities and gender nonconforming identities. The depthof the resistance to same sex sexuality is illustrated by the Turkish responses totwo worldwide surveys. In 2012 the World Values Survey Association found that85.4% of the Turkish participants said they would not want homosexuals as neigh-bors (World Values Survey 2012). Another study by the Pew Research Center (2013)found that 78%ofTurkish respondents felt that homosexuality should not be acceptedby society. The widespread nature of these attitudes creates a hostile environment atthe national level that drives LGBTQ individuals to search for welcoming spaces,though some settle for spaceswhich are at least “tolerant.” Given this atmosphere, thecosmopolitan identity of Istanbul provides a more welcoming approach comparedto other areas in Turkey (Atalay and Doan 2019a, 2019b).Istanbul’s diversity and the anonymity that comes with its large size attracts notonly LGBTQ individuals from across the country, but also from other nearby coun-tries. War, civil unrest, harsh discrimination as well as the death penalty for homo-sexuality in other Middle Eastern and African countries push LGBTQ individuals toseek sanctuary in Turkey (ERA-LGBTI, Turkey 2017).1 However, even in Istanbulnot all neighborhoods are welcoming, creating pressures for LGBTQ individuals tocluster. For example, in some traditional neighborhoods the high levels of mutualsurveillancewhere everybody knows everyone else’s business through the practice of“neighboring” (komsuluk) (Mills 2007) makes life difficult for anyone who disruptsexpected gender behaviors. These broader factors increase the importance of spacesfound in Beyoglu, Istanbul that are more welcoming of LGBTQ people. Istanbul’sBeyoglu district provides a variety of opportunities for the LGBTQ community tosettle down, socialize, and/or work in the district (Atalay and Doan 2019a; Gocer2011; Selek 2001). Furthermore, Pride Parades held on Istiklal Street in the heart ofthe area also attract LGBTQ individuals fromacross the country. Several intervieweesdescribed this process as follows:I have always lived in Istanbul. I did not move from another city or anything. But, I knew Ihad to move from where I was living. I knew the neighborhood I was living in [in Istanbul]would not bear with me; with my appearance. I would not be able to be myself…Even justmy presence…So, of course it was Beyoglu where I found myself next.1Istanbul is one of the very first stops for refugees from elsewhere in the Middle East, but is usuallyonly a temporary one because Turkey does not provide asylum status to non-European refugeeswho must be resettled in a third country. Until these refugees are resettled permanently, they aresupposed to stay in smaller urban areas designated as satellite cities in central Anatolia wherethey often experience harassment and violence from relatively conservative local communities(UNHCR (nd), Practice of Satellite Cities).12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 277Fig. 12.11 A home with a rainbow umbrella in Cihangir, Beyoglu (Source Image by authors)(From interview with Semra)Our associations were there. Beyoglu did not belong to anybody, any group or any nation.Nobody, no nation, not even Turks could dominate the area. It had so many immigrants,ethnic groups, a mix of people from different backgrounds. Not having an identity was away of having identity for Beyoglu. So, it was an area for us where we as LGBTQs, queers,lubunyas, lesbians, gays, trans could breathe relatively comfortably compared to the otherplaces. This is it.(From interview with Ayse cited in Atalay & Doan, 2019a) (Fig. 12.11)Beyoglu is a place where othered people can live. It has been the place of artists and allothered people from the beginning. Cihangir and Tarlabasi embraced the TTs (transvestitesand transsexuals)2 30 years ago just like they do today.(From interview with Demet by Turan 2011)2TTs is short for “transvestites and transsexuals” as used by interviewees.278 P. L. Doan and O. AtalayAnd yet even in Beyoglu there is a constant struggle for survival. The LGBTQfriendly restaurants, bars, and night clubs that attract LGBTQ people are often tran-sient, such as Club 14 (closed down), Club 20 (closed down), Prive (name and themanagement changed), 5. Kat (still operating), China Club (closed down) in 1990s;and Bigudi, Sahika, Gizli Bahce, Mentha, Anahit Sahne in 2000s. The struggleto claim space by these bars and clubs is mirrored by similar efforts by humanrights, LGBTQ, and feminist organizations such as LambdaIstanbul (relocated fromthe district), the Human Rights Association (IHD), SPOD, and Amargi. Even resi-dents attracted by the affordable housing, tolerant neighbors, andmulticultural naturestruggled with visibility.…while looking for a home and negotiating with real estate agencies or homeowners, youwould not want, for sure, your sexual orientation to be known by them. I would not revealmy sexual orientation to be known by my neighbor, my grocery store…So, we were notliving openly as lesbian individuals. I never kissed on the street, never held the hand of mygirlfriend. I was constantly keeping myself under my own surveillance and control.(From interview with Emel cited in Atalay and Doan 2019a)12.4.2 Centrifugal Forces in the Istanbul CaseThe imposition of renewed police enforcement empowered by ultra-nationalist andconservative groups in the 1990s in Cihangir (Selek 2001; Zengin 2014) is a clearexample of centrifugal forces operating on the queer spaces of Beyoglu. Prior to thisperiod many transgendered individuals had found safety in a cluster of group resi-dences where they supported themselves through sex work activities (Selek 2001).However, in the 1990s their homes were raided by the police who succeeded indispersing this marginalized community. The very centripetal forces which drovetransgender individuals together, later operated as centrifugal forces and scatteredthe community across the city into more dangerous waters. This dispersal was part ofa broader “cleansing” process by the “Cihangir Neighborhood Beautification Asso-ciation” that aimed to make the neighborhood more attractive for middle class andupper-class gentrification (Atalay and Doan 2019b; Zengin 2014) by pushing thetransgendered community out of Cihangir.Purtelas, Sormagir (now Basbug Street) and Ulker Street were our hangouts. The fascist atti-tudes of the Beyoglu Beautification Association and the Cihangir Beautification Associationtowards us should not be overlooked when life in these streets is discussed. They were theones who brought Suleyman the Hose (Suleyman Ulusoy aka Hortum Suleyman, dubbed theHose because he used hoses to beat trans people), they all collaborated with the state backthen.(From interview with Sevval by Turan 2011)The residential space opened by the displacement of the trans community enabledfurther real estate speculations and the renovation of existing residential and commer-cial units in a traditional gentrification process. Nevertheless, the district retainssome of its “tolerant” residents, queer friendly but not overtly visible bars and cafes,12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 279enabling the neighborhood to continue to play a central role for the LGBTQ commu-nity. Middle and upper middle-class individuals can still reside in the district, butother less fortunate and poorer LGBTQ people must play the role of “vicarious citi-zens” (Greene 2014), visiting the neighborhood to socialize at its relatively tolerantvenues.More recently, the inflammatory rhetoric adopted by President Erdogan and theIslamist Justice and Development Party (AKP hereafter) reinforced more conser-vative values across Turkey (Cindoglu and Unal 2017; Yasar 2019). This changein mindset is highlighted by the change in responses over time to one of the ques-tions of Pew Research Survey about “whether homosexuality should be accepted bysociety.” In 2002, 22% were in favor of acceptance, but this declined to 14% in 2007and 9% in 2013, reflecting a more oppressive and intolerant society, exacerbatingthe centrifugal forces on the queer community.Another manifestation of this government attitude is its influence on urban plan-ning decisions to encourage dramatic changes in the built environment, altering thecharacter of Beyoglu. In particular, the government’s 2005 release of its “Law for theProtection of Deteriorated Historic and Cultural Heritage through Renewal and Re-use” (Law 5366, hereafter the Renewal Law) stimulated a wave of redevelopment inthis area (Islam and Sakizlioglu 2015). The effect of the Renewal Law as a centrifugalforce on both queer establishments and the wider community can be clearly identi-fied in Tarlabasi another sub-district of Beygolu. This neighborhood’s long-standingimportance for the LGBTQ community has been undermined by a bitter state-ledgentrification process, resulting in the displacement of low-income groups includingminorities andmarginalized groups such as the Kurds, African immigrants, and transindividuals. Properties in the district deteriorated for many years until the rent gappotential of the area reached its maximum and a redevelopment process was initiatedat the prompting of government officials. Using the Renewal Law, Tarlabasi and sixother sub-districts of Beyoglu were declared urban renewal areas in 2006 (TarlabasiRenewal Project, n.d.). As a result of the public–private partnership project devel-oped in the area, many local residents were displaced in favor of new developmentstargeting upper-class luxury condo and office clients. Today, Tarlabasi is on the vergeof losing its critical role particularly for the transgendered community.A brand-new TarlabasiAt the heart of Istanbul and its storied pastA glittering lifestyle awaits, exclusively for youModern streets, fashionable cafes, and restaurantsConcept streets and world-famous brands(From the website of Tarlabasi Renewal Project, Taksim360). (Fig 12.12)The neoliberal restructuring of Beyoglu under the governance of AKP is a part of thegovernment’s attempt to change the social and cultural make-up of the area through“social engineering” (Yasar 2019). The centrifugal impacts of these changesmade thedistrict more appealing to conservative and international tourists and distinctly lessappealing to LGBTQ people. The intensity of these redevelopment initiatives also280 P. L. Doan and O. AtalayFig. 12.12 Tarlabasi Renewal Project, Beyoglu (Source Image by authors)reduced the multicultural welcome to anybody who wished to enjoy the nightlife ofthe district, sit on its sidewalks until the early morning, or who chose the area as theircommunal living place. One Turkish urban planning scholar, Murat Cemal Yalcintandescribed the real intent behind the urban renewal programs as a desire “to suppressdissident cultures that had been flourishing in and around Beyoglu’s various streetsand local establishments…” (Yalcintan 2012 cited in Yasar 2019: 52).The demolition of a movie theatre (in Beyoglu) was required and legitimized with the factthat it was one of the scenes of homosexuality and public sex.(From the interview with Mucella Yapici3 conducted by KAOS GL4 in Gocer 2011, no pagenumber cited in Atalay and Doan 2019b: 116).Another example of the government’s effort to suppress the dissident cultures andvoices in Beyoglu is the planned change to turn the existing Gezi Park in Beyoglu, awell-known cruising ground adjacent to Taksim Square and one of the few remainingopen spaces in Istanbul, into a shopping mall based on a replica of Ottoman Barracks(Erol 2018). The Gezi Protests started as a demonstration to protest this decisionand soon turned into a wider resistance against the ongoing authoritarian regime.During the Gezi Protests in 2013 and the following year, Pride parades witnessed3Mucella Yapici is the secretary general of Environmental Impact Assessment Department of theUnion of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects.4One of the LGBTQ organizations in Turkey.12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 281record attendances due to a solidarity synergy, acting as a renewed centripetal force.However the visibility of this movement also caught the attention of the governmentand the resulting overt suppression became a centrifugal force.Although the multicultural diversity of Beyoglu was targeted by government andreal estate developers for a neoliberal restructuring process, the area still preservesits critical role for the LGBTQ community. Pride parades (although officially bannedsince 2015) are still held on Istiklal Street which remains the heart of the district. Anumber of queer friendly bars and cafes at a variety of affordability options providethe opportunity for the LGBTQcommunity to socialize.While there is not a completecultural or political displacement yet (Hyra 2015), the changing character of thedistrict continues to act as a centrifugal force pushing the LGBTQ community tosearch for other “friendly” places where they can carve out their spaces such asBesiktas and Kadikoy.512.5 DiscussionTo better understand the queer afterlife of gayborhoods, we need to expand our under-standing of the ways in which gayborhoods (and other queer spaces) form and re-form. The linear model suggested by Collins (2004) uses a narrowly economicmodelto describe a possible end point of a gayborhood as it is integrated into heteronorma-tive society; perhaps this imagined afterlife of a gayborhood occasionally happens,but this is clearly not the case in all gayborhoods and especially not true in a globalsense. Our model of centripetal and centrifugal forces aims to improve our under-standing of the ways that LGBTQ spaces evolve and change in a more dynamiccontext, suggesting a different understanding of the “afterlife” of gayborhoods. Inplace of the linearity of gay village growth this chapter has emphasized that LGBTQpeople create spaces with varying degrees of openness or visibility depending onthe influence of the centripetal and centrifugal forces. This focus on the complexinterplay of forces that influence queer decision-making can be applied to a widervariety of “ordinary” cities that reflect an array of political and cultural contexts atdifferent scales. This approach urges us to look at the diverse ways that communitiesare formed and may be reformed in the future at different visibility levels. In effectwe are arguing for a queering of the unilinear model that seeks to “transform thematerial relations of oppression…[and] harness the productive power of represen-tation and discourse to produce social space through performance and parody thatexplode the restrictive, oppressive grammar of binaries” (Foucault 1977 as cited inDerickson 2009: 4).5Kadikoy is a municipality on the Asian side of Istanbul where queer spaces have started to emergeday by day. It appears that the emergence of these alternate queer spaces is a result of the centrifugalforces gaining power in Beyoglu and pushing the LGBTQ community to seek for alternatives.LGBTQ individuals living or socializing in Kadikoy also show tremendous efforts to be includedin the city and planning decisions. Kadikoy municipality also acts toward building a gender andLGBTQ inclusive planning process.282 P. L. Doan and O. AtalayIn the Atlanta case understanding the forces driving young queer people awayfrom Midtown might prompt different policy measures to reinvigorate Midtown asa neighborhood welcoming a diverse and often queer population. For example, thelack of affordable housing as well as behavior by recent Midtown residents sendsmessages to visibly queer individuals and especially those of color that they are notwelcome (Doan 2014) and may be driving away the very people that will ensure thatMidtown continues to be vibrant. Rainbow crosswalks are unlikely to be sufficient toarrest this trend. Efforts to ensure that a diverse housing stock is maintained (ratherthan redeveloped into expensive condos) and investments in community buildingefforts to address lingering homophobia may be more effective.Applying this framework to Beyoglu yields other insights. If we looked for theafterlife of a gay village in Turkey, we would be trying to find something that neveractually existed (gayborhood). Yet, in Turkey and many other locales, queer spacesoften occur in ways that may be visible only to the queer community itself. Whilesome others may be aware of such spaces, they may not be noticed by the intol-erant representatives of authority. And yet these places are also influenced by thecentrifugal forces such as rapidly rising rents that may make it harder to queerwelcoming establishments to thrive as well as help queer people to find housing.This framework emphasizes a focus not on the birth and death of spaces, but ratherdiffering degrees of existence. Our duty as scholars is to recognize and differentiatethese types of spaces in order to identify the complex mixture of forces that helpedto create and sustain them.Understanding these underlying conditions and the role they are playing in shapingqueer spaces in different contexts may enable interventions to transcend the hege-monic constructs of heterosexist urban planning with its focus on the use of orderand efficiency as tools of oppression by the state (Yiftachel 1998; Foucault 1980),resulting in the exclusion of marginalized communities (Doan 2011, 2015; Frisch2002; Yiftachel 1998). Instead of planning models that celebrate and fixate on the“city beautiful,” it is important to broaden our vision and recognize that what is acentripetal force to “heteronormativity” can be a centrifugal force to queer individ-uals whomay thrive in the anonymous interstices of urban life. Similarly, an LGBTQinclusive planning process should support the forces that act as centripetal for thecommunity and not undermine them with needless beautification projects. This kindof recognition may open new possibilities for broader empowerment of the full rangeof the LGBTQ community and the spaces they crave.12 After the Life of LGBTQ Spaces: Learning … 283ReferencesAdaman F, Keyder C (2005) Poverty and social exclusion in the slum areas of large cities in Turkey.Report for the European Commission, employment, social affairs and equal opportunitiesAdriaenssens Z (2011) Mapping the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in Atlanta.Atlanta: Unpublished Master’s paper for the School of City and Regional Planning, GeorgiaInstitute of Technology.

PodmoreAbstract Research onLGBTQneighbourhood formation in the urbanWest suggeststhat new patterns of community and identity are reshaping the queer inner-city and itsgeographies.As gay village districts “decline” or are “de-gayed” and newgenerations“dis-identify” with the urban ideals that once informed their production, LGBTQsubcultures are producing varied alternatives in other inner-city neighbourhoods.Beyond the contours of ethno-racialization and social class, generational interpre-tations of LGBTQ urbanism—subcultural ideals regarding the relationship betweensexual and gender identity and its expression in urban space—are central to theproduction of such new inner-city LGBTQ subcultural sites. This chapter providesa qualitative case study Montréal’s of Mile End, an inner-city neighbourhood that,by the early 2010s, was touted as the centre of the city’s emerging queer subculture.Drawing on a sample of young-adult (22 to 30 years) LGBTQ-identifiedMile Enders(n= 40), it examines generational shifts in perceptions of sexual and gender identity,queer community and neighbourhoods. The chapter concludes with a discussion ofthe implications of queer Mile End for theorizing the contemporary queer inner-city.Keywords Montréal · Quebec · Canada · Generations · Generational change ·LGBTQ identity · Gay neighborhoods13.1 IntroductionIn 2011, theMontréal mainstreammedia began announcing changes to local LGBTQ(lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans andqueer) geographies.Oneheadline read, “Thegay andlesbian community is no longer confined to the gay village” (Bélisle 2011) (author’stranslation). According to the article, Montréal was exhibiting “a new openness” toLGBTQ visibility, proof of which was an increase in small rainbow flags appearingin the windows of businesses throughout the metropolitan area.

Podmorepresence were especially notable in Mile End, an inner-city neighbourhood under-going culture-led development, gentrification and increased “place-making” by a newgeneration of queer-identified young adults (Fig. 13.1). “Queer Mile End” began toreceive media coverage and was promoted as the city’s new queer neighbourhood.The national LGBTQ publication Xtra! titled an article on Mile End “Out of theMontréal Village and into the world” (McCarthy 2011) suggesting that it repre-sented the liberation of LGBTQ populations from the sexual “ghetto” of the city’sgay village [theVillage]. But the press also implied that therewas an important differ-ence between the queerMile End subculture and themoremainstreamLGBTQ spaceof the Village. The lesbian publication Entre elles pronounced “The Mile End, theheart of queer life” (Giraud 2011) (author’s translation). The press further linkedMileFig. 13.1 Map of Mile-End and other eastern inner-city Montreal neighbourhoods (Source Mapby Author)13 Far Beyond the Gay Village: LGBTQ Urbanism … 291End’s young queer subculture to its well-established reputation for hipsters, foodierestaurants and the city’s alternative music scene. Xtra!, for example, proclaimedthat Mile End distinctively combined “a dash of gay and hip” (Wallberg 2012).The emergence of new and alternate LGBTQ inner-city neighbourhoods thatqueer Mile End represents is not unique. From Paris to Sydney, research over thepast decades shows a decline, de-gaying, displacement and disidentification withgay villages throughout the urban West (Brown 2014; Collins 2004; Collins andDrinkwater 2017; Doan and Higgins 2011; Ghaziani 2014; Giraud 2014; Gorman-Murray and Nash 2017; Nash and Gorman-Murray 2014; Ruting 2008). A corre-sponding decentralization of same-sex households to other inner-city and towardssuburban areas is increasingly demonstrated by macro-scale studies (Compton andBaumle 2012; Goldie 2018; Forrest et al. 2019; Hayslett and Kane 2011; Smartand Whittemore 2017; Spring 2013). As Ghaziani (2019: 7) proposes, today’sLGBTQ urban geographies form “cultural archipelagos,” interconnected “clustersfor specific subgroups” in more peripheral inner-city and inner-suburban areas.Qualitative case studies detail the varied places in the LGBTQ urban archipelagothrough the place-based specificities of outer boroughs such as New York City’sQueens or Brooklyn (Gieseking 2016; Martinez 2015), Sydney, Australia’s NewTown inner suburb (Gorman-Murray andWaitt 2009) and alternative inner-city areassuch as London, England’s “cosmopolitan post-gay Spitalfields” (Brown 2006), orin Toronto, Canada’s Parkdale neighbourhood (Nash 2013a, b). Gorman-MurrayandWaitt (2009) characterize such alternatives to the gay village as “queer-friendly”neighbourhoods, areas where a queer presence, while not dominant, is apparent andwelcome. Akin to Brown-Saracino’s (2011: 361) “ambient community,” such neigh-bourhoods provide a sense of “belonging and connection” shaped through interac-tions “among heterogeneous proximate individuals” that share similar dispositions,tastes and activities across sexual differences.This chapter extends this literature through a case study of Montréal’s queer MileEnd from the perspective of the LGBTQ young adults that shaped and participatedin its subculture in the 2010s. Drawing on interviews with young LGBTQ-identifiedadults (under 30 years of age) (n= 40)who lived inMile End and adjacent neighbour-hoods in 2013, it examines the building of a distinctively queer generational habituswithin Montréal’s inner-city. It is argued that queer subcultural districts such as MileEnd represent a spatial shift far beyond the gay village: less a diffuse dispersal ofLGBTQ residents from gay villages, they are formed through a generational rejectionof established versions of LGBTQ urbanism—subcultural ideals regarding the rela-tionship between sexual and gender identity and its expression in urban space. Thesegenerational shifts in understandings of LGBTQ identity, community and neigh-bourhood potentially offer insight into the greying of gay villages (Bitterman andHess 2016) as some young adult subcultures “disidentify” with gay village spacesand explicitly create and promote alternatives (Nash 2013a, b). Mile End’s young,queer-identified subculture reproduces a distinct queer habitus, a set of class-baseddispositions that shape aesthetic ideals and afford cultural capital (Bourdieu 1991).Applied to urbanism, this habitus rejects the rainbow flag commercial visibility and292 J. A. Podmoregender binary definitions of sexuality in the gay village while promoting a subter-raneanqueer ideal that values anti-normativegender and sexual identities, communityinclusion and urban diversity. The chapter’s conclusion reflects on the specificitiesof queer Mile End’s class, age and linguistic formulation, and considers the insightsthat this LGBTQ cluster offers to the study of queer-friendly neighbourhoods.13.2 MethodologyThe research profiled in this chapter is drawn from a larger project on Queer MileEnd that used snowball sampling and in-depth qualitative interviewing to accessand understand the subculture’s perceptions and experiences (Atkinson and Flint2001). The interviews were conducted by a team of four LGBTQ-identified grad-uate students (two trans-men, one queer woman and one gay man) who developedthe sample through their personal networks. The interviews were conducted in 2013when the student researchers were between 23 and 32 years of age and either living inor frequenting the queer spaces in Mile End. Due to their involvement with the queerMile End subculture, they were enlisted to define the neighbourhood and developthe questionnaire. Forty qualitative interviews of approximately one hour in lengthwere conducted and transcribed. Participants also completed a socio-demographicprofile self-identifying their sexual, gender, ethnic, racial, linguistic and social-classaffiliations as well as their regional and national origins. The interviews addressedtheir identities, migration trajectories and neighbourhood histories; perceptions ofother LGBTQ generations,Montréal LGBTQ scenes and neighbourhoods; and expe-riences of the gay village and Mile End neighbourhoods. Participants were asked todescribe Mile End, its queer scene and spaces, and to discuss its queer-friendlycharacteristics.Snowball sampling mitigated problems of recruiting a younger “hidden” subcul-ture for the primary researcher (aged 47 years in 2013) (Browne 2005), but the“double insider status” of the field researchers produced a remarkably homoge-neous sample (Adriansen and Madsen 2009) in terms of social class, language,“race”, occupation and nationality. The age range of the sample was between 22and 30 years with an average of 26.2 years. Most participants identified as white(70.0%), raised in middle/upper-middle-class households (57.5%) elsewhere withinCanada (60.0%), speaking English as their primary language (90.0%) and attendinguniversity or having recently completed a university degree (90.0%). The sample wasmore heterogeneous in its sexual and gender identities, ethnicities and geographicalorigins. Only 22.5% were raised in Montréal, the majority having migrated fromcities and towns across Canada (50.0%). Within the parameters of contemporaryqueer subcultures, their definitions of gender and sexual identity were wide-ranging.The next two sections analyze queer identity and urbanism from the perspective ofyoungMileEnders beginningwith an exploration of their sexual and gender identitiesfollowed by perceptions of Montréal’s gay village and Mile End neighbourhoods.13 Far Beyond the Gay Village: LGBTQ Urbanism … 29313.3 Generation QueerQueer cultural and LGBTQ youth studies note generational shifts in LGBTQ identityand youthful innovation and fluidity regarding gender and sexual identities (Driver2008; Halberstam 2003; Plummer 2010). Regardless of how they personally iden-tified, Queer Mile Enders were aware of queer politics which had reemerged inMontréal in the early 2000s (Hogan2005) andwas linguistically imported intoFrencharound 2010 (Laprade 2014). The profile data revealed the participants’ distinctpatterns of the gender and sexual identities (Table 13.1). In terms of gender, thelargest group identified as “women” or “female” (47.5%) followed by “men” or“male” (37.5%), “genderqueer” (androgynous, genderqueer, neutral or non-binary)(12.5%) and trans (trans, transgender and transsexual) (2.5%). In terms of sexuality,the majority identified as queer (57.5%) while the rest were divided between thosewho exclusively identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual (22.5%) and those who iden-tified as “queer” and lesbian, gay or bisexual (17.5%). When cross tabulated, thesestatistics revealed that those who identified as “women”, “genderqueer” or “trans”were the most likely to identify sexually as “queer”; those identifying as men wereless likely to identify with queer (53.3% did not) primarily choosing a gender binarysexual identities such as gay, MSM (men who have sex with men but do not identifyas gay) or bisexual.This gender difference in sexual identity was also reflected in the qualitativeinterviews. Few participants who identified as gay men also identified as queer(33.3%) while a majority of those who identified as women, described their sexu-ality as “queer” (73.9%). However, as this quote from Ève reveals, the links betweengender and sexuality for women-identified participants were complex:Table 13.1 Self-identified categories of sexual orientation and gender identityWoman,Female,FeminineMan, Male,MasculineTrans,Transgender,TranssexualAndrogynous,Genderqueer,NeutralTotalExclusivelyqueer1789.5%73.9%16.7%4.3%1100.0%4.3%480.0%17.4%23(57.5%)100.0%Exclusively lesbian,gay or bisexual15.2%11.1%853.3%88.9%00.0%0.0%00.0%0.0%9 (22.5%)100.0%Queer and lesbian,gay or bisexual15.2%14.2%533.3%71.4%00.0%0.0%120.0%14.3%7 (17.5%)100.0%Questioning 00.0%0.0%16.7%100.0%00.0%0.0%00.0%0.0%1 (2.5%)100.0%Total 19 (47.5%)100.0%15 (37.5%)100.0%1 (2.5%)100.0%5 (12.5%)100.0%40(100.0%)294 J. A. PodmoreWell, a woman because it is my sex and that is completely fine with me. A lesbian. I wouldsay queer, but right now, I don’t feel like I’m part of the queer community in Montréalbecause the queer community around me is more Anglophone and sometimes I feel like Idon’t really connect with queer Anglophones. I sometimes feel like I’m not included likeI do with other lesbians that I know who are Francophones. They might say that they arequeer too, but I feel more like a lesbian, but not like the lesbians in the Village who like toplay hockey. I don’t feel like I connect with them either. I would say I am between queerand lesbian. (Ève, Francophone, woman, queer/lesbian, 26 years)As this quotation illustrates, the idea of “queer” identity is strongly associated byFrancophones (78.4% of the Montréal population in 2016) with Anglo-AmericanLGBTQ culture. Moreover, Ève describes a binary between sexual identity, languageand urban space where the Mile End is the domain of young queer Anglophones andthe Village is the territory of older Francophone gays and lesbians.Since queer was such an important form of identification, participants were askedwhat it means to them. Many said that they identified with its power to contestheteropatriarchal norms. For Rudy, queer permits the integration of diverse sexualpractices (including polyamory and pansexuality) with gender diversity (such asgenderqueer or non-binary), but its power also lies in its opposition to norms: “Well,I feel like my sexuality can generally be described in opposition to hetero-dominantnorms” (Rudy, Anglophone, genderqueer, queer, 30 years). Savannah made a similarargument regarding why she identifies as queer:Queer signifies for me my own relationship with my gender identity which is more fluid thanthose I know who aren’t queer. So, I think that my identity as queer is in some ways a formof alterity. (Savannah, Anglophone/Francophone, woman, queer, 22 years)A desire for a term representing amore fluid sexual identity was another reason givenfor identifying with queer rather than lesbian or gay. This was particularly the casefor those who also identified as women. The power of queer’s fluidity was evidentin Jo’s reflections on her public identity presentation:I say I am a lesbian to people because that’s what they know of sexuality. Either you are astraight or a gay. So, to them, I’m gay, but I don’t identify as gay. I identify as queer, wheremy sexuality is constantly in rethink. (Jo, Francophone, woman, queer, 30 years)The second major reason for choosing queer was its inclusivity of varied genderidentities.Mer said: “… for the last 13/12 years ofmy life I identified as a lesbian/gay,but for the last couple of years… I’d love to say I am a queer because I feel it’s a moreinclusive term” (Mer, Francophone, woman, queer/lesbian, 30 years). In contrast, thecategory lesbian was especially unpopular (only chosen by 10.4%) because it wasperceived as creating essentialist boundaries of gender around sexuality, producingexclusions for trans people, but also for those who practiced polyamory, or whoidentified as genderqueer or pansexual.Many participants distinguished between queer and gay and lesbian identitiesin intergenerational terms. When asked how their generation differs from previousones, many said that older generations do not understand nor identify with the wordqueer:13 Far Beyond the Gay Village: LGBTQ Urbanism … 295Older people don’t even know the word queer. Well, they know what queer means, but theydon’t know. They’d rather call themselves gay, you know, bisexual, lesbian… Some of themdo have a lot of queer politics, but don’t have the words for it. (Rue, Anglophone, man, queer,25 years)Older LGBTQswere depicted not only as beingmore comfortablewith binary config-urations of gender, but also as being more invested in these categories to define them-selves (i.e. as gays and lesbians or as trans-men and -women). Horatio echoed thissentiment regarding older trans women:There’s a lot of older trans women I know …, they have different idea of gender than I doand it’s kind of a clash … they’re very into like if you’re a boy or girl and for them being awoman is really important and good for them. But for me I don’t really identify that way.(Horatio, Anglophone, transfeminine, queer, 28 years)Alexandra represented these differences regarding gender identity as a specificchange initiated by her generation and even associates them with progress:The main thing for me seems to be, just that we’re advancing more on gender stuff. So, it’sboth being more committed to being inclusive on trans issues and like, people who aren’ttrans being aware of the issues or trying to be allies and stuff. And also, femme visibilityis coming up too. So, that’s again around gender presentation. Yeah, just like less binary, Ithink it’s getting less binary all the time. That’s really nice. (Alexandra, Anglophone, woman,queer, 25 years)13.4 Divergent LGBTQ UrbanismsThe queerMile End subculture defines itself through several interpretations of genderand sexual identity including anti-normativity, sexual fluidity and non-binary gender.It is also produced through generational contrasts with its predecessors. This sectioncompares queer Mile Enders’ perceptions of the gay village and Mile End to furtherunderstand how this generational subculture is constructed relationally in urban spaceby opposing two types of LGBTQ urbanism: (1) the fixed, gender-bound and visibleidentities in the Village; and (2) the fluid and secondary sexual and gender identitiesthat are celebrated within the framework of neighbourhood diversity in Mile End.While the questionnaire had many lines of inquiry regarding each neighbourhood,the focus here is on responses regarding the identities associated with each neigh-bourhood and the comparison of their meanings for LGBTQ identity, communityand spaces in Montréal.13.4.1 The Gay VillageMontréal’s gay village lies on the eastern edge of Montréal’s downtown core. Itbegan to develop as both a gayborhood in the early 1980s and, by the mid-1990s,was promoted as such by various levels of government and the media (Hinrichs296 J. A. Podmore2011). Its business improvement association has also played an important role inpromoting and branding the area with decorations such as the pink balls that hangover its pedestrianized main street every summer (Podmore 2015) (Fig. 13.2). Themost “visible” LGBTQ space in the city, theVillagewas a common point of referencefor all participants whether they were describing their own residential histories orintergenerational differences in the meaning of queer. However, the questionnairedid have specific questions about perceptions and experiences of the Village. Thesequestions included how often, when and why participants frequented it, what theyliked and did not like about it, and who it was for. It is worth noting that mostparticipants reported that they “rarely” frequented the Village. Many also saw it asa space from their past, a place they frequented when they were young or had firstarrived in Montréal. It was also associated with “coming-out” and early quests forLGBTQ community.Important themes emerged in response to the question “who is the gay villagefor?” First, the participants unanimously identified it as a place for gay men. AsAlexandra observed: “Well, the Village seems to me to be pretty obviously centredaround gay cis-men… there are just a lot of stores and a lot of the bars and everything.It’s very obviously catered to that market” (Alexandra, Anglophone, woman, queer,25 years). Second, participants associated the village with older generations. Kylesaid: “I think it is for the older generation, I think that’s who keeps it going. Oldergenerations, 40s and50s, that’s the backboneof theVillage, not the younggeneration”(Kyle, Anglophone, man, gay, 29 years). Third, most said that the Village was forgender binary people. As Marie-Claire observed, the Village belongs to “… peopleFig. 13.2 Festivalization and pedestrianization ofMontreal’s gay village (Source Image byAuthor)13 Far Beyond the Gay Village: LGBTQ Urbanism … 297who identify as gay, female or male, people who identify as being ‘born this way’”(Marie-Claire, Francophone, woman, queer/lesbian, 30 years). Rue also made thedistinction between queers and gays and lesbians in the Village: “… the Village isnot for queer people. The Village is for gays and lesbians” (Rue, Anglophone, man,queer, 25 years).The Village was primarily seen as a site of homonormativity due to its white-ness, police surveillance, commercialism and tourism. Homonormativity refers tothe assimilation of LGBTQ people into mainstream heterosexual society and thepromotion of a depoliticized LGBTQ culture that is anchored in consumption(Duggan 2002). The following comments from three of the participants representthis interpretation of the Village:It just seems like it’s just a very different scene. I just have this image of being sort of likeeither lesbians or gay men which is neither of the things that I identify as. It seems reallymore commercialized… It seems sort of like the epitome of what white gay capitalist cultureis. (Tabatha, allophone, woman, queer, 28 years)I mean, I guess there’s kind of like a dominant gay male culture that dominates that space.That’s kind of my sense of it. It’s like a mainstream gay culture that is kind of ubiquitousin at least Canada and the States and various other places. It’s just it’s a certain kind ofmainstream. It’s like if gay culture could be mainstream. It’s like this particular brand of gaymale culture that I find very normative in many ways. (Theo, Anglophone, man, queer/gay,23 years)I feel like the Village is friendly to a specific type of queer. Not only to a specific type ofqueer, but a person who wouldn’t be as active or supportive of the queer movement. Themost predominant or visible members, or successful members of joining the hetero majority,of being accepted by the hetero majority, is the Village. (Zachary, Anglophone, man, gay,25 years)Village homonormativity did not simply lead to disidentification but was furtherunderscored by a sense of exclusion. Indeed, the Village was often described as anunwelcoming place for those that queer cultures perceive themselves as working toinclude such as trans and genderqueer people, young queers and queers of colour.For Rue, it was not only that the Village was primarily made in the image of gaymen,but also that “… for female-identified people, like bars, I don’t know, it’s just notvery welcoming, you know? Like, definitely not very welcoming for trans people,definitely not very welcoming for people who just like don’t fit in any sort of genderbox” (Rue, Anglophone, man, queer, 25 years). Confirming earlier work by Doan(2007), trans participants voicedmixed feelings about theVillage. Although it housesmany trans community support and activist groups, participants expressed a senseof exclusion and even feelings of hatred from gay men in the Village. For example,Robin described it as a transphobic space:As a trans-woman, I don’t like the Village that much… the only people who actually wouldcall me tranny or would feel like totally fine doing that would be like gay men in the Village,and they would like shout it, you know? Whereas, … even for like transphobic dudes on thestreets, they wouldn’t think to call me that necessarily. (Robin, Anglophone, woman, queer,28 years)A sense of exclusion also stemmed from its commercialism and the ways that thepolice survey its public spaces. Young, queer and alternative in appearance, queer298 J. A. PodmoreMile Enders are not a key clientele targeted by gay village entrepreneurs. Jean said:“I’m just not welcomed there as someone who’s not a tourist and as someone wholooks probablymore like the homeless kids than like the rich suits whowant to like goto the bathhouses, you know?” (Jean, Anglophone, genderqueer, queer, 26 years).Queer women, on the other hand, were ambivalent about the Village’s commer-cialism. They often said that there was nothing there to attract them because thetarget market was gay men. While many went there occasionally, they noted that theVillage’s social order, revolving around hook ups and saunas, excluded anyone whowas not a cis-gendered gay man.As Village outsiders, participants also saw this area as lacking a sense of commu-nity and being rather too commercial and tourist oriented. Village commodificationof LGBTQ identities contrasted with the queer urban ideals that oppose commer-cialism and value community-based productions of space. Thus, the Village wascontrasted with the more communal productions of queer spaces in Mile End. Forexample, Rue said that the Village is “… kind of focused around money and lessso on community”. Comparing it to Mile End, he said that he would be surprised ifthere was a pay-as-you-can or fundraiser event in the Village and drew the followingconclusion:That area’s not about community and that’s like what I would definitely associate as a bigcomponent of what queerness, in its political aspect, means to me is community, and that’swhy I never go down there because to me it’s like, you know, exactly what I said, it’s likea bunch of ignorant straight cis people that just happen to have gay sex. (Rue, Anglophone,man, queer, 25 years)The tourist orientation of the Village was also repelled queer Mile Enders.“Tourists”—LGBTQ tourists from elsewhere and non-LGBTQ consumers both localand visiting—were considered integral to the Village’s commodification of LGBTQidentities. Savannah even said that Village tourism transformed LGBTQ people intoa consumer spectacle:I’d say the Village attracts LGBTQ tourists and also non-LGBTQ tourists. I feel like it’s oneof those things that’s still in tourism books and whatever as, like, “this is where the gays are.You can come see the gays in their natural habitat.” (Savannah, Anglophone/Francophone,woman, queer, 22 years)Its commodification and tourist promotion also rendered theVillage “too accessible”,suggesting that there was a lack of cultural capital associated with frequenting thisdesignated LGBTQ area. Auguste, for example, implied that the Village is “… basi-cally more men-oriented and old people go there or people from outside of Montréalwho don’t know the community.Well, they do know it, but it’s more touristic”.Whenasked to clarify, she said: “It’s more advertised… You go a little bit further into theMile End and Pop Montréal with all the artistic stuff … there’s another community,it’s more underground” (August, Allophone, woman, lesbian, 22 years).13 Far Beyond the Gay Village: LGBTQ Urbanism … 29913.4.2 Queer Mile EndMile End is located two kilometers directly to the North of the Village. It was atwentieth-century immigrant “gateway” community and is today celebrated for the“cosmopolitanism”of its public spaces and as a centre of cultural production (Bedford2015; Germain and Radice 2006; Rantisi and Leslie 2010). One of a few districtswith a historic concentration of lesbian households, it has housed the city’s few queercommercial spaces (Royal Phoenix Bar and Le Cagibi Café) and been the centrefor ephemeral queer events. Thus, an LGBTQ presence in its main commercialstreetscapes has never been highly visible (Fig. 13.3). About 40% of the samplelived within Mile End while another 50% lived in the two neighbourhoods on itsnorthern boundaries (Rosemont-Petite-Patrie and Parc-Extension) or to the East andWest of the area (Le PlateauMont-Royal and Outremont). Another 10% lived furthernorth in the Villeray District. While those who lived within Mile End’s boundariesdetailed their daily lives in the neighbourhood, all participants were asked about theirperceptions and experiences of the area as well as its queer-friendly attributes. Forthose who lived slightly outside of its boundaries, it was the centre of their queersubcultural lives, a zone that they frequented often and where they had dense socialnetworks.To define the queer Mile End subculture more clearly, participants were asked todescribe whowas involved in its production. Their responses were extremely similar.Fig. 13.3 Mile End commercial streetscape (Source Image by Author)300 J. A. PodmoreFirst, queer Mile End was composed of young, white queers who were primarilyAnglophone and middle-to-upper-middle-class. As Ève described it:I would say that it is basically Anglophone and young. It includes a lot of trans people…It’s very artsy, like students and young professionals but not entrepreneurs… So, I wouldn’tsay it’s like high class, or rich kids, but their parents are rich, and they became queer orwhatever… . (Ève, Francophone, woman, queer/lesbian, 26 years) (author’s translation)Jake also said that the queer scene in Mile End is “… very Anglo. I mean I knowlike a lot of Anglo quote-unquote radical queers that live in this neighbourhood”(Jake, Anglophone, transmasculine, bisexual, 26 years). He also observed that thereare “… a lot of like hipster music scene queers and art queers and whatever. Like,just a very hip, Anglo, queer scene” (Jake, Anglophone, transmasculine, bisexual, 26years). Second, like Jake, participants often spoke of the blurring of the boundariesbetween queer and hipster. Ashley’s comments provide an example: “It’s sort of likethe hipster queer. It’s the cool queer. I don’t know. It’s trendy to be queer in the MileEnd” (Ashley, Allophone, woman, queer, 28 years). Thirdly, in contrast with the gaymen who predominate in the Village, they said that the queer Mile End communitywas based in a community of queer women who were trans-inclusive. ForMer, queerMile End is “… mostly girls, females who have a non-normative sexuality. I’m notgoing to call them lesbians because they wouldn’t identify necessarily as that, justas queer” (Mer, Francophone, woman, queer/lesbian, 30 years). David made similarobservations:I would say that there are more queer women and I would say trans people who identify asgenderqueer or as like non-gender binary in the Mile End than in the Village. There are defi-nitely a lot of trans people in the Village, but usually people who identify differently and haveaccess to different types of analyses about trans-ness. (David, Anglophone/Francophone,man, gay/queer, 23 years)In summary, queerMile Endwas defined as the opposite of theVillage: it is young andcool, one part queer and one part hipster; it is based in a community of queer womenwho embrace trans-inclusion; it is predominantly Anglophone; and, according toqueer Mile Enders themselves, it is populated primarily by those with high levels ofeducation which brings elevated levels of social and cultural capital.When asked if the Mile End is queer, most said yes, but with the caveat that it isnot exclusively queer because many populations make a place for themselves in thisneighbourhood. Those who replied affirmatively gave the following explanations:(1) many young queers live in Mile End; (2) it is the primary location for queersubcultural events (fundraiser parties and dances); and (3) it houses the city’s only“queer” businesses (Cagibi Café and Phoenix Bar). Thus, Léo said:I think in a general way yes, it is, because most of the queer events that I went to were locatedin the Mile End. And I think that those people do a lot of things in that space. There are alot of queer-friendly spaces in the Mile End. So, I do believe in a general way that we couldsay that. (Léo, Allophone, man, gay, 26 years)Sukie was more hesitant, refusing to state that the neighbourhood itself is queer. Shestated, “I guess so? A lot of queer people live there. I guess it is queerish, where13 Far Beyond the Gay Village: LGBTQ Urbanism … 301the most queer people live, ish. But, is it itself queer? I don’t think so” (Sukie,Francophone, woman, gay/queer, 23 years). Many participants subscribed to thisinterpretation of Mile End as a shared neighbourhood that is diverse and inclusive.According to Marc:I’d say that it’s a queerer neighbourhood, but it’s so much more than a queer neighbourhood.I think there’s a big element of that, but I’d say it’s artistic, it’s inclusive, it’s ethnicallydiverse as well more than queer, but it’s queerer for sure. (Samuel, Francophone, man, gay,26 years)Diversity and respect for diversity—often represented by the presence of the HasidicJewish community that occupies the streets in the western portion of Mile End—was a neighbourhood characteristic valued by the participants. As the urban studiesliterature on gentrification suggests, Queer Mile Enders share this urban ideal withother members of the new urban middle-class in inner-city areas of the urban West(e.g. Brown-Saracino 2009; De Oliver 2016; Tissot 2014; Zukin 2008).While ethno-cultural, socio-economic and sexual diversity signaled “inclusion”in Mile End, the presence of other overlapping alternative youth cultures was alsodefinitive of its queer potential. Participants often pointed out that they were notthe neighborhood’s only youth subculture and that the boundaries between queer,hipster and creative youth subcultures was not always clear. As Dvora pointed out,the queer aesthetic has been “… adopted by non-queer people... so you can’t alwaystell. So, like the line between queerness and hipness is like blurry…” (Dvora, Anglo-phone, genderqueer, queer, 23 years).Many others noted that the boundaries betweenhipsters and queers were blurred rendering all young people in Mile End as queer.As Nancy remarked:I think everyone in theMile End gets read as queer. I think it’s interesting, but I also think it’sa bit much. Because, you know, the hipster aesthetic, the queer aesthetic, one can always getthem confused you know. So, I think people get read as queer, but maybe you don’t identifythat way. So, I think there’s a hypervisibility that’s not real. (Nancy, Allophone, woman,queer, 26 years)Nancy described this hypervisibility as an illusion that perhaps made the Mile Endappear more queer-friendly than its reality. But many participants ascribed advan-tages to inhabiting spaces where the boundaries between queer and non-queer youngadults were fluid. Some noted that because the sexual identity of hipster men wasambiguous, their presence could evacuate the area of the hegemonic norms ofmasculinity that might exist elsewhere. Moreover, young hipster men, even if hetero-sexual, were interpreted as being always-already progressive because of their youth.According to Adrienne: “You know, I feel like people who seek the Mile End arepeople who want to belong to this scene that is progressive and not the old way”.According to her, one aspect of this progressivism was that in the beginning “…hipster men … they like probably looked gay” (Adrienne, Anglophone, woman,queer, 23 years). Therefore, the disruptions in mainstream masculinity signaled bythe male hipster aesthetic marked Mile End as a non-heteronormative area. Partici-pants also perceived that sexual diversity was not an issue for other people of theirgeneration. Therefore, sharing the neighbourhood with other “progressive” young302 J. A. Podmoreadults further rendered Mile End more welcoming for young queers. As an example,Archibald said that he liked it “… because Mile End is not like a defined gay neigh-bourhood at all, in the way that the Gay Village is a gay neighbourhood… but there’sa lot of young gay people, and just kind of very young accepting people, who aren’tgay of course there” (Archibald, Anglophone, man, gay, 25 years).At the heart of this argument is the idea that sharing space with hipsters serves todisrupt heterosexual norms and to recode the area’s spaces as progressive, creativeand open. This blurring of the embodied aesthetics of young populations was accom-panied by a sexual indeterminacy surrounding the neighborhood’s public and semi-public spaces. Jake found it difficult to distinguish between queer and hipster spaces:“It’s like a bit of a hipster neighbourhood.Whether it’s queer…? I think there’s a lot ofqueer events that happen there, but I think there’s like a lot of venues generally there,but whether they’re like queer or not, you know?” (Jake, Anglophone, transmascu-line, bisexual, 26 years). Violet said, “…what’s unique aboutMile End is that there’sa bunch of places that are not explicitly queer but have a ton of queer staff workingthere that queer people feel comfortable going” (Violet, Anglophone, woman, queer,28 years). These included bars, restaurants and cafés that were owned by queers orplaces she described as being, “…maybe not queer-owned, but queer-populated”. Inits less visible and subtle queer presence and its patterns of integration across sexualdifferences, Mile End is represented as an archetypal queer-friendly neighbourhood(Gorman-Murray and Waitt 2009). Its version of LGBTQ urbanism is also distinctfrom that of the Village. Jaimie, for example, described her understanding of thisversion of urbanism: “I think that the idea of space in theMile End for queers is morelike inhabiting and not needing to necessarily identity-label yourself or like only beassociating with gays or lesbians or whatever” (Jaimie, Anglophone, woman, queer,29 years). For her, queer urbanism inMile End was “Less rainbow flags kind of styleand like being able to live more of an integrated daily life” (Jaimie, Anglophone,woman, queer, 29 years).13.5 ConclusionThis chapter extends the portrait of LGBTQ neighbourhoods forming outside ofgay villages and underscores the specific generational shifts that Montréal’s queerMile End represented in the early 2010s. Since that time, the neighbourhood hasbeen evacuated of its queer subcultures and businesses as gentrification has driventhem northwards into adjacent neighbourhoods. However, for a time, another formof LGBTQ urbanism emerged here that was distinctly queer within Montréal andcontrasted with the territorial ideal and gender binary identities of Montréal’s gayvillage. Primarily inhabited by Anglo young adults from middle and upper-middle-class families, the version of LGBTQ urbanism that Mile End represents is basedin ideals of inclusion regarding sexual identity and more complex understandingsof gender beyond sex binaries. These ideals of community and identity translateinto a form of urbanism that celebrates non-commercial understandings of LGBTQ13 Far Beyond the Gay Village: LGBTQ Urbanism … 303community, exceeding gender and sexual identity, and an overlapping with otheryouth subcultures laid upon the backdrop of Mile End’s ethno-cultural diversity.This form of LGBTQ urbanism is distinct fromwith the late-twentieth century ethnicenclave as a model that territorializes LGBTQ identities and practices in gay villages(Nash 2006; Ghaziani 2019).While unique within Montréal, queer Mile End’s urbanism parallels many of theobservations in the urban studies literature on the changing geographies of the queercity, but it also challenges them. Confirming Ghaziani’s (2019: 12) argument thatthe city’s many LGBTQ cultural archipelagos “exist in a productive tension withgay spaces like the gayborhood”, queer Mile End is not unrelated to Montréal’s gayvillage. Rather, distinction among queer Mile Enders is acquired through a “with-ingroup”, class-based, generational contrast with the city’s more touristic, commer-cial, accessible and mainstream LGBTQ space. But the example of queer Mile Endalso indicates that the boundaries between the two are harder than the more fluidvision Ghaziani (2019) has for the islands of the archipelago. This aspect of theproduction of queer identities in Mile End suggests that much more attention shouldbe paid to the boundaries surrounding “queer-friendly” neighbourhoods. As Giraud(2012) argues, queer Mile End is much less accessible than Montréal’s gay villagefor young people of other social classes. Social class and other factors (in this caselanguage) create an “ambient community” signaling shared values from which tobuild cross-subcultural and generational commonalities beyond gender and sexuality.Queer Mile Enders ultimately felt greater affinity for other Mile End youth subcul-tures than they did for LGBTQ subcultures elsewhere. Following their class-basedhabitus, they embracedmany of the principles of “hipster urbanism” (rejectingmain-stream consumption, celebrating neighbourhood authenticity and cosmopolitanism,and surrounding themselves by cultural production) (Cowen 2006; Le Grand 2018;Hubbard 2016) rather than the sexual identarianism and communitarianism that oncemade the gay village. While not conclusive, these findings suggest that much greaterattention to alternate neighbourhood formation processes is needed to capture thecontemporary reshaping of the queer city after the gay village.Acknowledgements The author would like to thank the student researchers and the participants.This research was supported by grants from Quebec’s Fonds des recherche—Société et Culture(FRQSC) and Concordia University’s Part-time Faculty Association (CUPFA).ReferencesAdriansen HK, Madsen LM (2009) Studying the making of geographical knowledge: theimplications of insider interviews.

We theorize that LGBTQ+individuals may identify with two generational cohorts—one defined by birth yearand a second related to “coming of age” as a sexual minority. A case study exam-ining the lifespan of four LGBTQ+ celebrity personalities demonstrates the conceptof generational layering. We argue “generational layering” affects various aspectsof LGBTQ+ life, including connection to place as reflected in attitudes of LGBTQ+people regarding gay neighborhoods. The chapter concludes with five takeawaymessages that clarify the relationship between LGTBQ+ people, the generationalcohorts to which they belong and with which they identify, and the attitudes ofvarious LGBTQ+ generational cohorts toward gay neighborhoods.Keywords Gay neighborhoods · Gay studies · Gayborhoods · Generations ·Generational theory · Greatest Generation · Baby boomers · Generation X ·Millennials · Generation Z · LGBTQ+14.1 IntroductionGenerations give structure to society.

HessLGBTQ+ people have been impacted by generational values and expectationsandmore recently have begun to engage generational identity differently than hetero-sexual peers. LGBTQ+ individuals do not always “fit” into the paradigm of their birthgeneration in the same way that heterosexual individuals do. As societies advancefrom one generation to the next, one measure of progress made toward equal civilrights can be seen in the changes in the attitudes and perceptions of LGBTQ+ people.Typically, behaviors and values of each successive heteronormative generation reflectbroadly-held opinions and behaviors of that generational birth cohort, including atti-tudes and views regarding LGBTQ+ people and lifestyle. These prevailing opinionsundoubtedly influence LGBTQ+ people. We argue in this chapter, however, thatLGBTQ+ generations do not operate solely in concert with their “birth” generation.Instead, LGBTQ+ individuals are dually influenced both by the heteronormativebirth generation in which they are born and by the LGBTQ+ generation during whichthey “come of age,” which is related to “coming out” and forming a personal iden-tity as an LGBTQ+ sexual minority. This “layering” or “dual-lens” through whichpeople prescribe a generational label recognizes the multivariate attributes that shapegenerational behaviors and beliefs and overall worldview for LGBTQ+ individuals.In this chapter, we examine the generational saeculum of the past century and therelationship of each successive generation to the birth cohorts of the entire century.Just as the behaviors, attitudes, and values of each heteronormative generation areclearly defined, we argue that similar—but different— parallels can be claimed forLGBTQ+ generational cohorts. Throughout, we develop a broad overview of birthgenerations and LGBTQ+ generations as a model for how generational theory mightbe applied specifically for LGBTQ+ individuals and LGBTQ+ generational cohorts,in that the experience for LGBTQ+ is arguably different and shaped by “coming ofage” more so than for heterosexual people. Our aim is not to oversimplify or stereo-type, but to construct a general guide to frame one potential perspective to betterunderstand the homonormative experience in a heteronormative world. Through thisrefreshed understanding, we examine comparative cases that describe the biogra-phies, general behaviors, and generational locus of four well-known gay men as ameans to explore how individuals born in a particular birth generation may experi-ence vastly different experiences in life due to the LGBTQ+ generation with whichthey identify. This comparison provides a basis for better understanding broader soci-etal forces that shape the evolution of gay neighborhoods throughout the twentiethcentury and into the twenty-first century along with observations about the perceiveddecline or plateau of gay neighborhoods.14.2 A Brief Overview of Generational CohortsA generation encompasses a cohort of people born over a defined two-decade span.Strauss and Howe (1991, 1998) describe a social generation as the aggregate of allpeople born over—approximately—a span of twenty years. Generations are identi-fied (from first birth year to last) by grouping cohorts of this length that share specific14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 309criteria. Therefore, an individual’s birth generation is typically defined by the yearof birth, and members of a birth generation share an “age location in history.” Thatis, members of the generation encounter key historical events and social trends occu-pying the same life phase. In this way, members of a generation are shaped in lastingways by the significant world events they encounter as children and young adults.They share certain common beliefs and behaviors. Aware of the experiences andtraits shared with their peers, members of a generation also share a sense of commonperceived membership in that generation (Strauss and Howe 1991).Generations are often influenced by formative events—war, famine, naturaldisaster, pandemic, economic upheaval, political unrest, etc.—that shape the behav-iors of the individuals within that generation. Put another way; people become prod-ucts of their time. For example, those born in the twenty years following the conclu-sion of World War II belong to the “Baby Boom” Generation and their lives wereshaped by the end of the war, reconstruction efforts, and a shifting economic andgeopolitical landscape. This generational worldview is a perspective through whichlife is framed over the lifespan. Just as people age independently, generations agein kind. Events throughout a generational lifecycle are signaled by benchmark yearsthat correspond to the individual lifecycles of generational members. For example,the year the first of the cohort turns 18 years old, and the year the last of the cohortturns 18 years old, as shown in Fig. 14.1, signals the beginning of “adulthood” forthat generation. This sliding scale of significant benchmarks frames the coming ofage for a particular generation, which can intersect with significant world events thatshape the values and impact the long-term outlook for that generation, as shown inFig. 14.2. These events are important in that they influence not only human behaviorsbut also individual outlook and expectations throughout a lifespan.A particular generation of people (born over a 20-year span) does not exist in isola-tion; each generation has interactions with the preceding and subsequent generations.Fig. 14.1 Generational cohorts between 1900–2100 (Source Graphic by authors)310 A. Bitterman and D. B. HessFig. 14.2 Generational cohorts and significant events for theLGBTQ+community (SourceGraphicby authors)Generations are organized in a series of four consecutive generations to comprisea “saeculum” which spans approximately 80 years, or roughly the duration of anaverage human lifespan, encompassing: childhood, young adulthood, midlife, andold age as shown in Fig. 14.1 (Strauss and Howe 1991). Strauss and Howe (1998)note that broad generational patterns—archetypes among the saeculum—and histor-ical events curiously appear to repeat in a relatively regular fashion over a lifespanand bear influence on the course of human history.Like all human beings, LGBTQ+ individuals belong to a generational cohortaccording to their birth year. However, we argue that some LGBTQ+ individualsalso identify with a second generational cohort, corresponding to the time of theircoming of age. Whereas a birth year assignment to a generation assumes heteronor-mative behaviors across a person’s lifespan, coming of age (which can occur atany point over the lifespan) has sometimes greater importance than birth on howan LGBTQ+ individual expresses sexual orientation and identity, given the socialinfluences and societal norms of that specific point in time. Therefore, LGBTQ+individuals belong to a birth generation and may also belong to a separate parallelLGBTQ+ generation based on the year the LGBTQ+ individual began to identifyas a sexual minority. However, we argue LGBTQ+ generations can also be delim-ited, distinct from broader heteronormative generational birth cohorts. As shown inFig. 14.3, the homonormative experience is shaped as a summation of the values,experiences, and events that shape a birth generation plus the values, experiences,and events that impact that person relative to their coming of age as an LGBTQ+14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 311Fig. 14.3 LGBTQ+ individuals often identify with two generations: one defined by birth year anda second related to “coming of age” as a sexual minority. The birth generation worldview is overlainby an additional LGBTQ+ generational worldview (Source Graphic by authors)individual. Because the coming of age or “coming out” moment may occur at anypoint along the continuum of the lifespan (as demonstrated by the Warhol, Hudson,Capote, Vidal case study below), the corresponding generational worldview for mostLGBTQ+ people is better defined by their coming of age than only by their birth.14.3 The Contemporary Heteronormative Saeculumand Events that Shaped the WorldThe analysis contained within this chapter encompasses six generations that span theend of one saeculum, the entirety of another saeculum, and the advent of a third. Thisperiod stretches across a four-century span from the very late 1890s to the 2100s.312 A. Bitterman and D. B. HessThese six generations correspondwith the time inwhich gayneighborhoods emerged,formed, matured, and plateaued (Hess and Bitterman 2021) and also encompass afuture unknown at present.Heteronormative birth generations are relevant to gay neighborhoods but in abroader, more encompassing manner than homonormative LGBTQ+ generations.General observations about the relationship of birth generations in relation to gayneighborhoods include:• The Greatest Generation comprises individuals born between 1901 and about1927, and many in this generation experiencedWorldWar I as children. Membersof this generation experienced the Great Depression as early adults, and manyparticipated in World War II. Freedom of gender expression or sexual orientationoutside of the defined societal norm was highly unusual, and most LGBTQ+individuals were closeted during this period (Chauncey 1995).• The Silent Generation includes those born between the late 1920s and the mid1940s and is the last generation of the Great Power Saeculum (the span of gener-ations from 1860 to 1945) (Strauss and Howe 1998). Many in this generationexperienced World War II or the immediate effects of the war as children. Littlefreedom or tolerance to express gender or sexual orientation outside of the definedsocietal norm defined this period (Chauncey 1995). However, the emergence of asecretive gay “code”—language, slang, and styles of dress—for identifying otherLGBTQ+ individuals began to emerge as a discernible subculture, especially intheatrical and circus professions (Baker 2020).• The Baby Boom Generation comprises people born after World War II, fromapproximately 1945 to 1960, and is thefirst generation of theMillennial Saeculum,which spans from1945 to the present.Many in this generation experienced the riseof the Atomic Age, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War. They partic-ipated in the social revolution of the 1960s that gave rise to broader rights forwomen (Gencarelli 2014) and steadily increasing tolerance for LGBTQ+ indi-viduals, at least across Europe and North America. The sexual revolution andliberation of the 1960s loosened the social constraint on the expression of sexualorientation and gender identity, especially for LGBTQ+ individuals (Drasin et al.2008). Though it was tolerated, homosexuality remained illegal in most jurisdic-tions through this period, and gay neighborhoods began to form in large cities asescapes from persecution and harassment (Lewis 2012).• Generation X is composed of people born between the early 1960s and the early1980s. Most in this generation experienced the Cold War, the birth of homecomputing, and the increasing digitalization of media. Some people in this gener-ation were on the front lines of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the early 1980s,while others watched as the HIV/AIDS pandemic devastated the LGBTQ+ popu-lation (Rosenfeld et al. 2012). During this time, LGBTQ+ characters began toappear on mainstream television, and laws prohibiting homosexuality in mostWestern societies were repealed or abolished. Gay neighborhoods became sitesof organizing and activism for dignity and equality and against the systemic14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 313discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals in the wake of the HIV/AIDSpandemic.• The Millennial Generation includes those born between the mid 1980s and theearly 2000s. Unlike previous generations, the social structure of the millennialgeneration focuses on flexibility, digital connection, and less association withinstitutions (Drake 2014). Millennials also witnessed as children the terror attacksof September 11, 2011, and throughout this period mass violence and terrorattacks—including the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the Columbine HighSchool shooting in 1999, the Paris terror attacks in 2015, the Tokyo subway sarinattack in 1995, and the London Westminster terror attack in 2018—became moreprevalent and many among this consequently generation experienced anxiety andfears regarding personal safety (Alexander Agati 2012). “Helicopter Parenting,”a byproduct of the anxiety caused by a rise in perceived threats surroundingMillennials, increased the likelihood of overprotective parents and decreased theability for children and young people to play outdoors unsupervised (Woolleyand Griffin 2015). Millennials were also the first generation to begin to disregardnotions of binary gender and destigmatize same-sex relationships (Jones et al.2014); this was an essential step in increasing civil rights and protections forLGBTQ+ individuals. The resultant plateau in gay neighborhoods may partly beattributed to the arrested development of this generation in which young adultslive with parents longer (Tomaszczyk and Worth 2020; Bleemer et al. 2014) andan increased generational propensity to speak with parents about sexuality andsexual identity (Drumm et al. 2020).• Generation Z includes individuals born from approximately 2005 to the present.Generation Z will be the last generation of the Millennial Saeculum. During thisperiod, civil rights and legal protections for LGBTQ+ individuals and same-sexmarriage became increasingly prevalent (Jones et al. 2014) in Europe, Australia,North America, and parts of South America. However, homosexuality during thisperiod remains illegal across much of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, andcivil rights and protections for LGBTQ+ individuals are few. Violence againstLGBTQ+ individuals has reemerged in countries like Chechnya and Russia andrenewed discrimination against LGBTQ+ people has resurfaced in countries likePoland.The relationship of gayneighborhoods toGenerationZ remains unclear, asthe oldestmembers of the generation are still too young to be living independently.Nevertheless, if trends with Millennials are an indication, then movement amongyounger people, in general, may begin to steadily decrease, which could impactthe longer-term sustainability of gay neighborhoods.14.4 Exploring LGBTQ+ Generations: Through the Eyesof Warhol, Vidal, Capote & HudsonExamining the lives of celebrities and well-known LGBTQ+ individuals offers a lensto summarize and illustrate typical behaviors and attitudes that have been formative in314 A. Bitterman and D. B. Hessshaping gay culture and the LGBTQ+ collective identity. Here we examine four well-known twentieth-century American personalities as a means to better understand thedifferences between LGBTQ+ individuals within the same generational cohort. Byexamining the events in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals, we can better understandthe formative factors that helped to support and shape gay neighborhoods.AndyWarhol,GoreVidal, TrumanCapote, andRockHudson (see Figs. 14.4, 14.5,14.6 and 14.7) were born during a four-year period, and all weremembers of the samebirth generation. Despite the close proximity of their birth years, these men—andespecially their LGBTQ+ identities—were, in effect, generations apart. As noted, thesocial values and mores of a LGBTQ+ generation are not necessarily in alignmentwith the societal values and mores of a corresponding birth generation. In this case,the discontinuity between the birth generation to which each man belonged andthe period during which their coming of age with regard to their LGBTQ+ identityoccurred was shaped not only by the values, behaviors, and mores of their birthgeneration but also overlaid by the generation to which they “came of age” as a gayman and a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Exploring the lives of these fourmen helps illustrate the differences between LGBTQ+ generational behaviors andthe dissonance between what we term LGBTQ+ generational cohorts in contrast tobirth generational cohorts (Figs. 14.4, 14.5, 14.6 and 14.7).Gore Vidal (1999, 2012) and Rock Hudson (Oppenheimer and Vitek 1987) wereboth born in 1925, and Truman Capote was born in 1924 (Long 2008; Dunphy 1987).All were members of the “Greatest Generation” of individuals born between 1901and 1927. Each of themen is nowknown to have been gay.However, each came of ageat different times, and they chose to publicly assert their homosexuality at a differenttime, influencing the manner by which they engaged their sexual orientation andexpression. Capote was openly homosexual and had same-sex lovers from an earlyage (Long 2008). His dress and behavior—partly what underpinned his unique brandof celebrity (Long 2008; Dunphy 1987)—was less stereotypically masculine thaneither Hudson or Vidal. Capote was atypical of his heteronormative birth generation.His coming of age occurred early in life, which places his behavior, the outwardexpression of gender identity, and sexual orientation in a much more contemporarytimeframe closer in behavior to a member of Generation X (people born about fiftyyears after Capote).In contrast, Vidal did not publicly acknowledge his sexual orientation or genderexpression, and much later in life vaguely identified first as bisexual (1999), and lateras homosexual (Kaplan 2013). Though born of the samegeneration asCapote,Vidal’sbehaviors were quiet (2012), his gender expression was comparatively cis, and hestayed consistent in behavior and presentation throughout his early life. However,he became slightly less guarded about his sexual orientation and more “out” as hegrew older. Vidal was a typical member of his birth generation. Still, over time,his behaviors and attitudes became more distinctive and in line with an LGBTQ+member of the Baby Boom Generation—quiet and perhaps conflicted, but open tosharing his sexual orientation to those “in the know.”For the better part of his life,Hudson did not publicly address his sexual orientation(Griffin 2020) but was a cis man and was straight acting in public. Moreover, Hudson14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 315Fig. 14.4 TrumanCapote (SourcePhoto byCarlVanVechten. Courtesy of:VanCechtenCollection,U.S. Library of Congress)316 A. Bitterman and D. B.

Hudson was one of the firstmajor celebrities to be diagnosedwithHIV/AIDS, and his coming out was implied defacto when he publicly revealed his HIV/AIDS diagnosis in July 1985 (OppenheimerandVitek 1987).Hudsonwas born amember of theGreatestGeneration and remained14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 317Fig. 14.6 1952 Publicity photo of Rock Hudson from Has Anybody Seen My Gal? (Source Imagecourtesy of Universal Pictures)both a birth member and an LGBTQ+ member of that generation for the entirety ofhis life.Each of these three men, born within a year of one another, belonged to thesame birth generation. Still, each chose to express his gender and sexual orientationdifferently, effectively coming of age with their LGBTQ+ identity at various pointsthroughout their lifespan. Their behaviors, outward expression of gender, and degree318 A. Bitterman and D. B. HessFig. 14.7 Gore Vidal (Source Photo by Carl Van Vechten. Image courtesy of: Van CechtenCollection, U.S. Library of Congress)14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 319of comfort with identifying as LGBTQ+ varied depending more on their LGBTQ+generation than their birth generation.As with Capote, Vidal, and Hudson, a desire or lack of desire to congregate andbe associated with other LGBTQ+ individuals in public impacted the emergenceand subsequent development of gay neighborhoods. Initially, gay neighborhoodswere populated by astereotypical individuals who did not “fit” into the predominantheteronormative society or were persecuted for their behaviors or beliefs. Capote is aprime example of such an LGBTQ+ individual, and throughout his lifetime, he wasahead of his time in being both publicly and privately “out.” Capote, arguably lesscis than either Hudson or Vidal, frequented gay establishments and was regularlyseen about town in gay neighborhoods in New York. Initially, during this time, gayneighborhoods were mostly the domain of “sissies,” “fairies,” or “queers” (GordonandMeyer 2007). Other LGBTQ+ individuals avoided gay neighborhoods either outof contempt or fear of public association with LGBTQ+ people or the denigrative“queer” label that was connected to those who frequented or lived in gay neighbor-hoods. Over time, however, gay neighborhoods diversified and became less homo-geneous, and this diversity helped achieve freedom of association beyond the stereo-type. Other LGBTQ+ individuals, perhaps less comfortable with being stereotypedas “fairies” or “sissies” (Fone 2000), began to participate in the vibrant LGBTQ+life the gay neighborhoods enshrined (Hanhardt 2013).Another contemporary of Hudson, Vidal, and Capote—and a member of thegreatest generation—is Andy Warhol. Born in 1928, Warhol defied all conventions,especially those related to gender identity and sexual orientation. Though he identi-fied as homosexual, details regarding his relationships remain mostly unclear, eventoday (Gopnik and Halstead 2020). Throughout his career,Warhol was unique in thathe completely disregarded any societal label for himself or others. Between the 1960sand the 1980s (throughout the latter part of his career),Warhol interacted socially andcomfortably with a diverse spectrum of personalities (Gopnik and Halstead 2020;Koestenbaum 2015) including the überwealthy, celebrities, up-byand-coming stars,starving artists, and homeless Bohemians. Warhol also located his studio within ornearby various gay neighborhoods inManhattan. In thisway,Warhol’s liberal attitudemirrored attitudes in gay neighborhoods as home to not only LGBTQ+ individualsbut as inclusive, accessible, and permissive neighborhoods where economic statusbecame less important than creative energy, potential, and persona.Warhol, however, was a formative and formidable force in the shaping of gayneighborhoods, first as voyeur and then as provocateur and later as an observer andunintentional historian of sorts. Throughout his diaries, Warhol referred to evolvingLGBTQ+ urban spaces, especially in and around New York City, as gay neighbor-hoods began to become performative and public but safe places for LGBTQ+ people.In 1977, Warhol reflected on his daily life in New York City: “we walked around theVillage. In the old days you could go over there on a Sunday and nobody would bearound, but now it’s gay gay gay as far as the eye can see—dykes and leather barswith the names right out there in broad daylight—the Ramrod-type places” (Warholand Hackett 1989: 51). Later, Warhol reflected on his time in New Hope, Pennsyl-vania, noting that it was “90 percent gay. We went to a place called Ramona’s and a320 A. Bitterman and D. B. Hessdrag queen served us and people were drinking at 2:00 pm. Gay old guys. It was toogay for me, it drove me crazy. Like a time warp. A gay hotel-motel. The drag queenlooked like Rupert’smother with the blonde beehive. She had on pants but a four-inchleather belt really tightening in her waist…Then, we went to places run by gay sonsand fat mothers. Antiques places” (Warhol and Hackett 1989: 718). Warhol’s diaryprovides insight into the constellation of characters that participated in creating thegay neighborhoods of New York through the 60s, 70s, and 80s.Despite his fascination with gay places and his high-profile interjection into gayneighborhoods, Warhol—despite his sexual identity—viewed himself as an outsideror observer (Koestenbaum 2015). “Gay” referred to other people, but in his mind,“gay” did not refer to him. The complexities of his self-identity, sexual orientation,and sexual expression were in ways well in advance of the time in which he lived.In this way, Warhol and his obsession with celebrity and cultural “influencers” andbroad acceptance and documented fascination with others (Gopnik and Halstead2020) defied his birth generation. His attitudes and behaviors are closer toMillennialbehaviors than to his birth generation. However, regarding his own outward sexualidentity, Warhol was very much typical of his birth generation—closer in behavior toVidal andHudson in viewing homosexuality as outside of his own experience, despitehis engagement in same-sex relationships. The complexity of his coming of age in atime when homosexuality was illegal, mixed with his fascination with celebrity andoutlandishness, sparked a curiosity in Warhol that helped to shape and support theculture of gay neighborhoods in New York City in the 1960s through the 1980s asinclusive and creative spaces. Through his art and signature publication Interviewmagazine, Warhol helped normalize same-sex relationships and LGBTQ+ cultureand construct a public face and voice for his followers—subsequent generations ofLGBTQ+ individuals. He provided for his followers and for successive generationsof LGBTQ+ people a type of freedom that he himself seemed reluctant to engage.14.5 The Homonormative Saeculum and the Eventsthat Shaped a Century of LGBTQ+ CultureThe experience for LGBTQ+ people—framed by the understanding and treatment ofLGBTQ+ individuals reflected in the values of mainstream society—is often quitedifferent from that of non LGBTQ+ people. Various degrees of implicit or explicitdiscrimination have existed (and continue to exist) for LGBTQ+ people. Attemptsby LGBTQ+ individuals to “fit in” to—or find safe space among—heteronormativesociety vary based on birth generation and other factors. In heteronormative society,an individual is influenced by the events of the world, but in homonormative society,the formula is compound. Individuals are shaped by the events of the world, layeredby fear or apprehension about how LGBTQ+ people are treated (or mistreated) bysociety at large and the perception (or observation) of how LGBTQ+ people are14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 321received by an individual’s immediate social circle. Therefore, clarifying the expe-rience of a “gay generation” could also shed light on the attitudes and behaviors ofLGBTQ+ individuals and even the degree to which LGBTQ+ engage gay neighbor-hoods and gay space.We propose appending the heteronormative generational namespopularized by Strauss and Howe to better incorporate LGBTQ+ experiences asfollows:• The SilentGeneration—or the “ClosetedGeneration”—gaymen cameof age justbefore, during, and immediately after World War II and lived in a world in whichthere was intense social pressure to conform to gender stereotypes. For many gaymen, the choice to outwardly identify as gay was not an option, and doing someant risking stigmatization, harassment or shunning (Bergling 2004). For thisgeneration, gay—for men—equated with feminine characteristics—suggestiveof the “lesser” sex—and the pejorative taunts “fairy” and “sissy” were used todenigrate the masculinity of gay men. Homosexual relations for this generationwere illegal, and being discovered or “outed” as a homosexual could bluntly enda career and ruin social standing. The social stigma against gay men was strong,and few gay and queer men willingly chose to endure pressure or harassment.Consequently, few gay men chose to be “out” during this era. Those that didoften fled to larger cities like New York and San Francisco. To avoid persecutionand harassment by the police, these early pioneers further gravitated within theselargemetropolitan areas to themargins of central cities—abandoned and forgottenneighborhoods populated by those that heteronormative society has labeled socialoutcasts and criminals—that became some of the first recognizable gay neighbor-hoods. These neighborhoods were diverse, inclusive, and tolerant. Residents ofthese early gay neighborhoods banded together to protect each other and fightagainst a sometimes oppressive social culture.• LGBTQ + individuals born during the Baby Boom Generation—the “Libera-tion Generation.” Gay men from this generation matured during the 1960s and1970s. Many more outwardly expressed their sexual orientation (compared to theprevious generation), though being clandestinely gay but still “in the closet” wascommon (Morrow 2001). High profile gay men hid their sexual orientation forfear of being “outed.” Remnants of the social stigma and shame prevalent duringthe previous generation persisted. However, the social turmoil of the late 1960sled to a broad social and sexual revolution in the 1970s (Troiden andGoode 1980).The Homosexuals, was a 1967 documentary produced and aired by CBS andhosted by Mike Wallace who framed homosexuality as an illness. Wallace inter-viewed guests who supported this claim and further edited the interviews to rein-forced his supposition that homosexuality was a deviant illness. One retrospectivereview of the program noted The Homosexuals was “the single most destructivehour of antigay propaganda” in American history (Besen 2003: 227). The show“not only had a devastating effect on public opinion but also was a nuclear bombdropped on the psyches of gay and lesbian Americans, who, prior to this show,had never been represented as a group on national television” (Besen 2003: 201).322 A. Bitterman and D. B. HessHowever, by the late 1970s, gay men began to appear in popular mainstreamculture. On television, Lance Loud in The Loud Family and Billy Crystal in Soaphelped to introducemainstreamaudiences to gay characters, not asDisney villains,deviant criminals, or effeminate stereotypes, but as “normal” individuals. Despitevibrant private lives, many high-profile gay men, such as Andy Warhol, livedduring this time “quietly” (i.e., publicly “in the closet”). Soon the “gay liberation”movement began. These contemporaneous social movements were consideredprogressive and permissive. Free love, equal rights, and expanded civil rightshelped to buoy rights for LGBTQ+ individuals. Despite the tumultuous transition,the winds of change had begun to blow for the LGBTQ+ community during thisperiod (Duberman 2019).• Generation X—the “Out” Generation. The experience of Generation X wasmarkedly different than previous generations with regard to homosexuality. Bythe 1980s, mainstream acceptance of homosexuality was beginning to grow—slowly—but social pressure against homosexuality remained. Gay slurs becamepart of typical teenage slang, but somemembers of this generation braved societaldisdain and disapproval and chose to live publicly as gay men or lesbian women.Theywere bolstered by the experiences of those from previous generations as theybegan to shed the cultural shame that encouraged LGBTQ+ individuals to stayin the closet, and they relished in the outcomes of the gay liberation movementas gay and lesbian individuals and their allies began to celebrate “gay freedom.”During this time, LGBTQ+ individuals tentatively began to find a collective voice,however mainstream heteronormative attitudes prevailed. Systemically and incomparison to today, bullying was more common and more tolerated; the notionof learning to “stand up for yourself” in the face of adversity was prevalent, andgender stereotyping was only starting to be examined.Additionally, LGBTQ+ members of Generation X were thunderstruck by theemergence of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals wasframed in part by a sympathetic mainstream public disappointed and outraged by alack of government acknowledgment and response and a blithe refusal to confrontsuffering brought about in the early days of the AIDS pandemic. Rock Hudson, ahigh-profile Hollywood heartthrob famous in the 1950s and 1960s, publicly revealedhis HIV positive status and complications from AIDS (Griffin 2020; Oppenheimerand Vitek 1987). This news was met with icy silence by his longtime friends, then-President RonaldReagan and First LadyNancyReagan.As “safe sex” became a topicintroduced to most high schoolers in health education courses, so too was—for thefirst time in any sanctioned capacity—the implication of homosexuality. High-profileefforts such as AIDSCoalition to Unleash Power (ACTUP), BroadwayCares/EquityFights AIDS, and the AIDSMemorial Quilt Project helped to forge public awarenessof the societal and institutional marginalization of homosexuality and the necessityto address the AIDS pandemic with facts and not with fear. At the same time, otherorganizations fought to denigrate LGBTQ+ individuals and against funding to finda cure for AIDS.14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 323GenerationX took notice ofmembers of theGreatestGeneration andSilentGener-ation as they struggled—often publicly—to reconcile the conflicting values of theirgenerations: to acknowledge homosexuals as productive members of society whileadmitting that previous treatment of LGBTQ+ people may have been unkind orimmoral.In contrast to previous times when popular cultural references implied shameor deviance related to homosexuality, many of the cultural touchpoints for Genera-tion X viewed homosexuality as a “normal” part of society, suggesting an openingfor the acceptance of LGBTQ+ people. During the formative years of developmentfor Generation X, psychologists and mental health professionals debated clinicallynormalizing homosexuality. As recently as 1968, the APA listed homosexuality asa mental disorder. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) asked allmembers attending its convention to vote on whether they believed homosexualityto be a mental disorder: 5,854 psychiatrists voted to remove homosexuality fromthe list of mental disorders, and 3,810 voted to retain it. The APA compromised,removing homosexuality from the list but replacing it with the label “sexual orienta-tion disturbance” for people “in conflict with” their sexual orientation. In 1987, theAPA removed homosexuality as a classified mental disorder (Burton 2015; Mayesand Horowitz 2005; McCommon 2006; Rissmiller and Rissmiller 2006).Simultaneously, the evolution and quasi-normalization of homosexuality playedout for Generation X in popular culture. Pedro Zamora, who was both gay and HIV+,became one of the first openly gay reality television stars. He appeared on The RealWorld, then a wildly popular show and generational touchpoint which aired onMTV.Zamora introduced Generation X to being gay, out, and proud of it. Shortly after,Ellen DeGeneres made television and social history in 1997 when both she and thecharacter sheplayed inher eponymous television showcameout as a lesbian.Changesin societal norms, reflected in popular culture, aided mainstream and heteronorma-tive audiences to better understand LGBTQ+ individuals as compassionate humanbeings and not as stereotyped gay caricatures. By the early 2000s, LGBTQ+ culturehad begun to fuse into mainstream culture—still relegated to an unequal place, butproudly present at the table (Johnston 2017). During this generational period, gayliberation had advanced to gay freedom and eventually became gay pride.• The Millennial Generation—the “Proud Generation” are those born between themid-1980s and the early 2000s and followed Generation X. LGBTQ+ individualsin this cohort and came of age at the beginning of the new millennium were lessconcerned with previously entrenched stigmas and stereotypes (MetLife MatureMarket Institute 2010). Members of the Millennial Generation were more likelyto be “out and proud” and socially more accepted than previous generations.Homosexuality became increasingly more accepted by heteronormative societyduring the period as this generation came of age, culminating in the legalization ofsame-sex marriage in Canada in 2005, Sweden in 2009, and the United Kingdomin 2013; in theUnited States, legalization of same-sexmarriage first occurred stateby state, but eventually the U. S. Supreme Court decision inObergefell v. Hodges(2015) legalized same-sex marriage nationwide (Hart-Brinson 2018). However,324 A. Bitterman and D. B. Hessin sharp contrast to members of the Silent Generation, Greatest Generation, BabyBoom Generation, and Generation X, LGBTQ+ Millennials have had far fewersocietal roadblocks to express their gender orientation and sexual orientation andare more likely than members of previous generations to describe fluidity orchanges in sexual orientation over time (Vaccaro 2009). Further, they have comeof age during a time of political correctness and comparatively low tolerance ofbehaviors that fuel stigma and division—bullying, racism, and sexism. Becauseof the lesser exposure to social friction for LGBTQ+ members of the MillennialGeneration, may LGTBQ+ gays and lesbians are understood bymembers of othergenerations to be blithely unaware of the persecution, harassment, and strugglesendured by predecessor LGBTQ+ individuals. In this way, LGBTQ+Millennialsare seen by others to take for granted their equalities and freedoms, which werefought for by LGBTQ+ people who came before them.• Generation Z—the “Fluent Generation”— The newest generation, GenerationZ, completes the present saeculum and includes those born between 2005 throughtoday. The behaviors, values, and perspectives of Generation Z are different fromthose of preceding generations (Archer 2012), shaped in part by the connec-tivity provided by digital technologies (Mowlabocus 2016) and the ability toform and participate in virtual communities using social media (MetLife MatureMarket Institute 2010). Generation Z came of age in a period of expanding rightsfor LGBTQ+ individuals punctuated by landmark legal cases such as the U.S.Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County, in which the Court held that TitleVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination(Jurva 2020) on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Today, theseyoung people are likely to find amore open space for discussing their sexual orien-tationwith family, parents, andmentors at a young age (Dean 2014). Furthermore,they will find greater acceptance as they explore various paths related to sexualorientation and sexual identity. They are unlikely to be subjected to the samedegree of heteronormative social stigma of generations past related to status as asexual minority person.14.6 The Intersection of LGBTQ+ Generational Cohortsand Gay NeighborhoodsWhy is place so important for young gay people? During a “coming out” or “comingof age” related to sexual identity, many people leave an oppressive place in whichthey find themselves which may include separating from family, siblings, or parents.Many people explore their sexual identity as teenagers or college-age students andthen move to a new place to begin their adult life. Place, in this way, becomes vital inself-selecting community and expressing personal values along with sexual identity.For LGBTQ+ people, this transition may be especially important as young people14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 325Fig. 14.8 LGBTQ+ generations and neighborhood change (Source: Graphic by authors)transition from parental and familial control to making their own decisions in adult-hood, which underscores the layering for LGBTQ+ individuals of birth generationand “coming of age” generation.The energy young adults bring to gay neighborhoods is the consistent (Bitterman2020a). This energy is also the constituent that frames LGBTQ+ generations,which helped to shape the gay neighborhoods in existence today. The desire amongLGBTQ+ individuals to live in a community such as those foundwithin gay neighbor-hoods has been consistently evolving and changing over the past five generations, andthe influx of young adults from each LGBTQ+ generation, along with their energyand ideas helps to sustain gay neighborhoods for the next generation, as shown inFig. 14.8.While the popularity of specific neighborhoods may wax and wane with genera-tional attitudes and values, the overall trajectory has been an upward one. In Fig. 14.8,the presentmoment is depicted as a plateau. The stewardship and forwardmomentumof gay neighborhoods has consistently been in the care of members of the previousgeneration who have “come of age” and then handed down to younger membersof subsequent generations. This graphic suggests that gay neighborhoods began toemerge following World War II, fueled by the Greatest Generation members as theyreturned from fightingWorldWar II (Chauncey 1995). Substantial growth continuedthrough the 1950s and 1960s as members of the Silent LGBTQ+ generation cameof age and again through the 1970s as members of the Boomer Generation came ofage. The period from the 1960s to the 1980s is often referred to as “the great gaymigration,” when many LGBTQ+ individuals moved to cities to establish their lives.The baby boomers fueled a period of sharp growth in gay neighborhoods duringthe 1980s and 1990s before LGBTQ+ members of Generation X had come of age.Growth continued until about 2000 as LGBTQ+ members of Generation X came ofage, but has plateaued since LGBTQ+ members of the Millennial generation havestarted to come of age.326 A. Bitterman and D. B. HessBirth generation attitudes persist throughout a person’s lifespan, and values—theembodiment of these attitudes—are typically formed early in adult development. ForLGBTQ+ individuals, these valuesmay shift or be overlaid by values of the LGBTQ+generation to which they later belong.While societal mores change over time, gener-ations provide constant frames of reference, and a “worldview” that remains tetheredto a generational cohort. The case study of Hudson, Capote, Warhol, and Vidal illus-trates the disassociation between birth generation and LGBTQ+ generations. Thedifference for most LGBTQ+ people is that the product is typically more complexandmultifaceted as the generational touchpoint is rooted in a heteronormative society.The complexity of gay identity during the middle to later twentieth century—borne of generations influenced by social values and cultural mores instilled in theirparents by their parents a century before—resulted in a conflicted state of exis-tence for gay neighborhoods during their emergent and formative years. Those whofrequented, inhabited, and visited gay neighborhoods balanced a personal disassoci-ationwith their LGBTQ+ status, persistent cultural judgment and shame, and a desirefor discretion with the freedom to express their true feelings through cautious partic-ipation and permissiveness. Older generations of LGBTQ+ pioneers helped buildgay neighborhoods as safe spaces unthreatened by the harassment and persecutionof a hostile world (Bitterman and Hess 2021). These respites provided fertile groundfor a first generation of pioneers to organize, mobilize, and activate a wave of advo-cacy for LGBTQ+ recognition and rights. These trailblazing generations shifted thepublic perception of “being gay” away from illegality and dereliction toward toler-ance and normalcy. The societal stigma attached to being gay was magnified duringthe HIV/AIDS pandemic—and the adversity experienced by gay men during (andafter) that pandemic—shaped a generation of LGBTQ+ activists, pioneers, and allies(Bitterman and Hess 2021). Challenging those in power and the institutions of powerwas no small effort for these trailblazers.Gayneighborhoods served as the geographiccenters of a cross-generational movement, and gay neighborhoods remain essentialto the shared cultural memory of the struggle for dignity, rights, and civil protec-tions for LGBTQ+ individuals. These hard-won aspects underpin LGBTQ+ pridecelebrations today. The uneasy balance of identity and gay neighborhoods commonamong the Greatest Generation was quickly torn apart by Baby Boom leaders ingay neighborhoods during the HIV/AIDS crisis. The stigma and pretense quicklyevaporated to ensure survival. However, as later generations came to more broadlytolerate LGBTQ+ individuals, the judgment and stigma of LGBTQ+ individualsdid not immediately dissipate. Gay neighborhoods during this period from 1980to 2000 provided a respite for LGBTQ+ people—and especially gay men—fromheteronormative standards and judgment based on the associated expectations.Gay men from three generational cohorts—the Silent Generation, the GreatestGeneration (like Warhol, Vidal, Hudson, and Capote) and Generation X—were partof the “great gay migration” to cities in the 1960s through the 1980s (Weston 1995).People from marginalized groups could feel more comfortable, more accepted, andfreer in large urban centers. After they migrated to large urban centers, they foundthemselves settling in gayborhoods: businesses—especially bars, restaurants, and14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 327cafes—catered to this captive audience. While most gay neighborhoods have histor-ically been welcoming and inclusive to nearly everyone, the majority of gay neigh-borhoods were predominantly home to gay men. At the same time, the bars, cafes,and businesses supported a broader constituency under the LGBTQ+ umbrella (and,later, non-LGBTQ+ people). Lesbian women and other LGBTQ+ individuals tendedto live elsewhere, and some viewed gay neighborhoods as gay “male” space. Forexample, bars and nightlife provide one example of the differences in inclusive andexclusive LGBTQ+ space common in the near past.Until about 20 years ago, most LGBTQ-friendly bars tended to cater to one shadeof people beneath the LGBTQ+ umbrella. The target market became part of the iden-tity of the bar (“lipstick” lesbianwomen, “twink” [i.e., young] gaymen, “bears,” etc.).While welcoming, in general, lesbian bars were not frequented by gay men; lesbianwomen also did not typically frequent gay bars, and so on. However, gay bars becameincreasingly “gay-friendly” by actively welcoming allies and friends of the LGTBQ+community. In this way, the bars became less exclusive andmore inclusive (and todaymost welcome everyone—including those who do not identify as LGBTQ+) but arenotably “less gay.” This specific division common among bars in gay neighborhoodsoriginally meant that the many stripes of the LGBTQ+ community had individualspace within a larger shared domain: the gay neighborhood. Similar observationscould be made about cafes, restaurants, and shops in gay neighborhoods.A loss of regular neighborhood bars has reduced social mixing opportunitiesamong LGBTQ+ people from various generations (Bitterman and Hess 2021; Eeck-hout et al. 2021).While previous generations of gaymen preferred to socialize in barsvisited strictly by gay men, those attending parties in gay neighborhoods today seekinclusive “gay-friendly” dances and events (Eeckhout et al. 2021): “the relativelyexclusive, niche-specific, semi-public spaces of lesbian and gay bars that promised asafe haven in a largely hostile environment lost their raison d’être faster than anyonewould have expected a few decades ago” (Eeckhout et al. 2021, 238). These changesin how LGBTQ+ individuals socialize in gay neighborhoods underscores broadersocietal shifts among younger generations (Bitterman and Hess 2021).Between 2000 and 2020, some gay neighborhoods have appeared to plateau inpopularity and use. The reasons for this perceived plateau aremany and explored else-where throughout this book (Hess and Bitterman 2021). One notable shift is youngermembers of the Millennial and Z generations (who participated less directly in thestruggle for LGBTQ+ rights) may not fully grasp the importance of gay neighbor-hoods on LGBTQ+ culture and lesbian and gay life (Bitterman and Hess 2021) andmay have a lesser propensity to engage in the community offered by gay neighbor-hoods. This may signal an emerging shift or potential disconnect between older andyounger LGBTQ+ generations, especially as fluidity in gender expression and sexualorientation shifts LGBTQ+ identity among the younger generations (Bitterman andHess 2021). Effectively, for younger generations, makingmainstream and heteronor-mative neighborhoods “more gay” is more desirable than simply gravitating toexisting gay neighborhoods. The result is that gay neighborhoods, as members oflater generations, begin to pull away and become “less gay.”328 A. Bitterman and D. B. HessWith these shifts, some anxiety has arisen among the denizens of LGBTQ+ neigh-borhoods about the perceived demise of the incidental physical importance of thesespaces, which may have interrupted the continuity among LGBTQ+ generationalcohorts and accentuated the disconnects between various groups under the LGBTQ+umbrella (Bitterman and Hess 2021). The closure of gay bars, emerging virtual gayspaces, and changes in the character of gay neighborhoods are reminders that asthese places transition from being home to generations rooted in the struggle, toplaygrounds of generations benefitting from that struggle, now may be a criticaltime to examine the present plateau in the trajectory of gay neighborhoods (Coffin2021). These younger individuals may view gayborhoods as relics of the past ormay find gay neighborhoods not to be welcoming in ways that match contemporarysensitivities toward inclusivity (Bitterman and Hess 2021).Gay neighborhoods provide one means for examining generational evolution andchange, and perhaps most acutely reflect a discontinuity between value and theneed/desire for shared place. Gay neighborhoods also provide a physical locationfor capturing LGBTQ+ cultural history and provide community support for organi-zations that capture and commemorate this history. Memory is short from generationto generation in relaying shared experience and collective history. Despite claimingto be motivated by the struggles of past generations (Hall-Kennedy 2020), membersof more recent LGBTQ+ generations often are unaware of specific details of thestruggles and challenges encountered by previous generations, partly because these(typically) oral history details remain largely unrecorded and the places associatedwith the historical record are usually not fully documented or commemorated (Millerand Bitterman 2021). Unrecorded, the resultant collective wisdom forged by bandingtogether as a community to overcome shared challenges risks being lost as momentspass into history. Over time, this transition away from an instigating problem maycause youngerLGBTQ+ individuals to take for granted the freedoms, acceptance, andrights hard-won by previous generations of LGBTQ+ people (Bitterman and Hess2021). This discontinuity can shift behaviors and the focus of immediate importancefrom one generation to the next and contribute to a loss of community and perceptionof relevance for gay neighborhoods.A lack of continuity and awareness may threaten the existence (Podmore 2021)and the lasting value of gay neighborhoods (Miller and Bitterman 2021). In theUnited States, a national effort was started during the Obama administration to iden-tify, memorialize, and landmark sites that provide significance to the history of theLGBTQ+ community (Miller and Bitterman 2021). This important endeavor wasintended to affirm the critical importance and relevance of these sites for genera-tions to come (Bitterman and Hess 2021). The survival of smaller gay districts (andgay districts located in small- and mid-sized cities) is more threatened than estab-lished gay districts in larger metropolitan areas (Ghaziani 2021), and some loca-tions have informally commemorated LGBTQ+ significant places within or neargay neighborhoods.14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 32914.7 Future Possibilities for Gay NeighborhoodsThe perspectives regarding gayborhoods among successive generations of LGBTQ+residents is changing. Attitudinal perspectives among generations are one significantfactor in shifting demand for gayborhoods among LGTBQ+ groups. We believe thatthe inter-relation of these factors both shapes and reshapes the lived experiencefor LGBTQ+ people in neighborhoods and cities. As the stigma associated withidentification with groups under the LGBTQ+ umbrella decreases universally, theneed/desire for living in places underscored by segregation and self-isolation mayalso change.The physical building blocks of gay neighborhoods—commercial establishments(bars, restaurants, bookstores), services (community centers, health clinics), andresidences—may be removed or displaced due to various urban forces includingneighborhood change, revitalization, gentrification, socio-cultural influences (tastes,preferences, and attitudes), and even equal rights legislation (Bitterman 2020a; Eeck-hout et al. 2021; Hess 2019, Hess and Bitterman 2021). However, if gayborhoods(or elements of gayborhoods) are at risk of or indeed disappearing, then the need topreserve these memory spaces becomes urgent so that the social action that occurredthere is documented, (Miller and Bitterman 2021) especially for future generations.Today, many LGBTQ+ individuals—especially younger groups of individuals—embrace a broadly inclusive definition of sexual orientation and find little value inlabels such as “gay,” “lesbian,” “transgender,” and other sexual minorities (Podmore2021). These younger individuals may view gayborhoods as relics of the past or mayfind gay neighborhoods not to be welcoming in ways that match contemporary sensi-tivities toward inclusivity (Bitterman andHess 2021). Similarly, the older residents ingayborhoods are often less comfortable with the sexual diversity that younger peopleeasily accept or the sexual fluidity they may practice. It can be difficult to distinguishbetween queer and hipster (Podmore 2021), and the hipster aesthetic marks gaybor-hoods as distinctly non-heteronormative space. For non-LGBTQ+ individuals, “theidea that sharing space with hipsters serves to disrupt heterosexual norms and torecode the spaces as progressive, creative and open” (Podmore 2021, 304) under-scores the generational shift with regard to gay neighborhoods. This is not a newphenomenon, as illustrated by the example of how Andy Warhol engaged the gayneighborhoods of New York and the various types of individuals that found a senseof belonging there.Sexual fluidity among later generations shifts the generational perspective of gayneighborhoods (Bitterman and Hess 2021). Among those traditionally not foundbeneath the LGBTQ+ umbrella, gender fluidity and diversity of gender expres-sion—long conflated with “being gay”—has become more clearly articulated andis becoming more socially accepted. Shifting perceptions of gender, gender identityand fluidity, and gender expression—paralleling the rise of “gay-friendly” culture—have given a broader mainstream voice to queer culture (Seidman 1994). We nowlive in a post-binary multi-polar world, and this change is reflected in neighborhoodsand places (Hess 2019).330 A. Bitterman and D. B. HessOne example of the shifting language surrounding LGBTQ+ identity is thefamiliar amalgamation of words that reference homosexuality as a cultural touch-point, which are becoming increasingly common. For example, “metrosexual”—astraight male with grooming or fashion-conscious characteristics typically associ-ated with gay men—is one example of this cross-over. Similarly, a “lumbersexual”is a homosexual with specific “butch” characteristics (manner or dress) reminiscentof a lumberjack. “Cuomosexuals” are those individuals who appreciate the effortsof New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo, especially in fighting the COVID-19pandemic (Miles et al. 2021). In contrast to the “de-gaying” of gay neighborhoods,this shift could be considered the “gaying” of heteronormative society.The increased precision of language to describe LGBTQ+ individuals repre-sents significant changes in worldview and perspective led by later generations whoembrace less prescriptive and less rigid descriptors related to gender and sexual orien-tation. Observing the more recent blurring of differentiation between queer cultureand hipster culture in the gay village of Montréal. Podmore (2021, 303) argues that“the boundaries between hipsters and queers were blurred rendering all young peoplein Mile-End as queer.” As generational thinking related to the expression of iden-tity changes, this will likely alter gay neighborhoods and, indeed, all neighborhoods(Bitterman and Hess 2021), though the long-term effects of these changes remainunclear.Perhaps “second generation” gay neighborhoods will serve future cohorts ofLGBTQ+ residents, citizens, families, and visitors by providing similar (and perhapsnew, unimagined) functions just as established gay neighborhoods have served pastgenerations (Bitterman and Hess 2021). While not all “seed” communities willflourish and external forces may even extinguish some, it is likely that as the needsof LGBTQ+ citizens and families change, so too do the types of neighborhoodsthese citizens and families require as gay neighborhoods potentially reconfigure forthe future. In this way, gay neighborhoods could reconstitute around the archetype,reflecting their existence for the previous five decades or in a form that does notyet exist. Moreover, we anticipate that established gay neighborhoods will prop-agate via an “afterglow” (Coffin 2021) as historically relevant sites become land-marked or memorialized (Miller and Bitterman 2021). We expect to see new typesof gay communities emerge in the future, especially as the Baby Boom Genera-tion and Generation X (and subsequent generations) age into retirement (Hess 2019;Bitterman and Hess 2021). However, these neighborhoods may be different thanthose we know today.14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 33114.8 Synthesis and Conclusion: Connections for LGBTQ+People Across Generational CohortsTo conclude this chapter, we synthesize the material presented to develop five take-away messages. The takeaway messages underscore a layered approach to inter-rogating generational theory related to LGBTQ+ individuals and experiences ingay neighborhoods. We aim to enlarge scholarship about gaps between generationalidentity for LGBTQ+ people since traditional generational theory has seldom beenapplied to LGBTQ+ people or communities.In particular, we seek to extract from a considerably detailed investigation ofthe most recent six generations, a more nuanced understanding of how LGBTQ+members of various generational cohorts view the nation of segregated gay neighbor-hoods and how they have (or have not) contributed to sustaining gay neighborhoodsto bestow them on subsequent generations of LGBTQ+ people.14.9 Takeaway MessagesTakeaway Message 1: Generational Worldview Shapes Gay NeighborhoodsDifferent generations of LGBTQ+ individuals view and value gay neighborhoodsdifferently.Members of LGBTQ+ generational cohorts can be identified according to atypical 20-year span. We argue that the process of achieving societal acceptanceand winning civil rights may be different for each of the constituents under theLGBTQ+ umbrella and that LGBTQ+ people experience “layered generations”based on their birth year and time when they came of age.Throughout their evolution, gay neighborhoods have been nurtured and sustainedby LGBTQ+members of earlier generations (as shown in Fig. 14.8) for the gener-ation that follows. Interest in gay neighborhoods, however, has begun to decreaseamong younger Millennials. We attribute this decline partly to different gener-ational pressures—threats of terrorism, violence, and a general lack of a senseof collective safety—that have shaped lifestyle attitudes for this generation ofyoung adults. In contrast to previous generations, manyMillennials remain closerto home and retain close relationships with parents and family members. AsLGBTQ+ members of earlier generations encounter less social resistance to theirLGBTQ+ identification or expression of sexual orientation, members of latergenerations may view gayborhoods as relics of the past or may find gay neighbor-hoods not to be welcoming in ways that match contemporary sensitivities towardinclusivity (Bitterman and Hess 2021).Takeaway Message 2: Gentrification May Be Killing Gay NeighborhoodsGay neighborhoods are waning as older residents are selling or moving, andLGBTQ+ people from younger generations are not replacing them.332 A. Bitterman and D. B. HessThis observation may be more related to real estate cost and the value placedon homeownership among members of the Millennial generation than about thevalue of LGBTQ-supportive community. As noted, generational differences inhomeownership and living at home with parents longer is more common amongMillennials than among previous generations (Bleemer et al. 2014).Gay neighborhoods were in their evolutionary infancy during the Baby BoomGeneration and Generation X periods, and property was inexpensive during thisearly period. However, urban real estate demand has changed over time as gayneighborhoods have gentrified or hypergentrified (Moss 2017). Often, LGBTQ+individuals that belong to earlier generations simply cannot afford to live in estab-lished gay neighborhoods, and living independently is often not a priority for thosein earlier generations.Members of later generations also appear to be more comfortable discussing theirgender identity and orientation with parents, family, and friends. The need to “runaway” or physically re-locate to a gay neighborhood to find acceptance may bewaning, but by staying behind in heteronormative neighborhoods, these youngindividuals may (perhaps unknowingly) be making these neighborhoods “moregay.”TakeawayMessage 3:MoreRecentGenerationalCohorts EmbraceTechnology,and This Imperils Gay NeighborhoodsTechnology allows later LGBTQ+ generations to create virtual communities and hasdecreased the demand for and interest in gay neighborhoods.Technology, perhaps more than any other factor, defines the generational divide.It has enabled a younger generation to socialize in a manner different from theirelders. However, technology has also provided opportunities formembers of oldergenerations to stay connected.While technology is often cited as a potential reasonfor the possible decline of interest in gay neighborhoods among younger LGBTQ+individuals, this assessment is shortsighted because technology has also enabledmany older LGBTQ+ individuals to remain connected despite advanced age.For example, LGBTQ+ members of earlier generational cohorts may appreciatethe nightlife that gay neighborhoods provide, but younger LGBTQ individualsalso frequent gay bars, restaurants, and other gay neighborhood establishmentstechnology in hand. For one generation, the attraction is place-driven, for anotherit may be place, driven by technology.Millennials and subsequent generations may place a different value on livingamongLGBTQ+communitymembers in a gay neighborhood because technologylets them live anywhere and still actively communicate with the peoplewithwhichthey desire to associate. We note that various generations of LGBTQ+ individualsengage technological change differently, and the COVID-19 pandemic has furtherinfluenced the way nearly everyone engages technology (Miles 2021; Miles et al.2021).14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 333Takeaway Message 4: Heteronormative Neighborhoods Become “More Gay”While Gay Neighborhoods Become “Less Gay”Millennials and later generations seem more comfortable disregarding societalexpectations and constraints and less comfortable self -segregating into gay neigh-borhoods.Over the years and as the generations progressed, some LGBTQ+ individualsleft gay neighborhoods, forced out in part by increasing housing costs related togentrification and hypergentrification. To remain viable, many gay bars, restau-rants, cafes, shops, and other gay-oriented establishments in gay neighborhoodsadapted and welcomed people from more diverse groups (including straightpeople), making those neighborhoods “less gay.” At the same time, mainstreambars, clubs, shops, and restaurants across the broader city began to more overtlywelcome LGBTQ+ individuals making those neighborhoods “more gay.” Asnoted, Millennials typically experience less resistance than previous genera-tions in expressing their sexual orientation and identity. They may be makingheteronormative neighborhoods “more gay” without being aware that they aredoing so.Takeaway Message 5: Enhanced Civil Rights for Later Generations Stifle theNeed for Gay NeighborhoodsGreater societal acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals makes more recent generationsless likely to live in gay neighborhoods. There is consequently a view that many gayneighborhoods have lost their authenticity.Younger LGBTQ+ individuals from more recent generational cohorts have comeof age in a time when being gay is broadly accepted throughout mainstreamculture, and LGBTQ+ individuals enjoy greater recognition and enhanced civilrights and legal protections. As a result, the desire to purposely isolate with likepeople for protection in specific geographiclocations has seemingly diminished.Millennials—whether LGBTQ+ or not—are likely to behave more uniformlyregarding housing preferences and choices about neighborhoods and cities fortheir residential location (Nash 2013). These observations suggest broader societalshifts, not necessarily a diminished demand for or interest in gay neighborhoods(Fig. 14.9).Most gay neighborhoods were, for many years, centered around gay bars andnightlife that provided gathering space for sexual minorities. Gay neighborhoodshave historically provided a degree of insulation from police brutality, hate-fueledviolence, and harassment, especially among those misunderstood or ostracized bythe mainstream. However, as LGBTQ+ individuals enjoy greater civil rights andlegal protections, social stigma related to identifying as LGBTQ+ has decreased.Compared to generations past, younger LGBTQ+ individuals tend to enjoy agreater degree of familial support when identifying as a sexual minority. Culturalshame associated with LGBTQ+ status in the Silent and Greatest Generationshas diminished and has been replaced for subsequent generations by pride. Thesechanges are markedly generational.334 A. Bitterman and D. B. HessFig. 14.9 People of all ages—and from several generational cohorts—find common ground inthe Church Street neighborhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Source Image courtesy of RobertModzelewski)14 Understanding Generation Gaps in LGBTQ+ Communities … 335Significantly, with the legal right of same-sex couples to marry, the gay familymodel has transformed. For example, a gay baby boomer likely has a somewhatdifferent nuclear family make-up than a millennial gay man may have or maywish to have. A more traditional family structure (two married adults with chil-dren) is becoming more common in LGBTQ+ communities, and this may serveto change the flavor of gay neighborhoods as LGBTQ+ families seek amenities(such as daycare, schools, and family-centered medical care) that were not tradi-tionally associated with gayborhoods. However, this shift does not mean that gayneighborhoods are dead or dying. LGBTQ+ individuals recognize gay neigh-borhoods as the center of gay culture and will often socialize and celebrate inthese locations. Meanwhile, the need to seek refuge in an urban gay neighbor-hood has diminished because LGBTQ+ individuals continue to proudly fight forequality and civil rights, ensuring that smaller cities and towns are more inclusiveof LGBTQ+ people as residential settlements everywhere become “more gay”through a diffusion of formerly concentrated LGBTQ+ communities.ReferencesArcher B (2012) The end of gay: (and the death of heterosexuality).

Evidence demonstrates that the preservation of historic sites allowsfor future generations to benefit from intangibles related to community and identity.However, the LGBTQ+ community has been unable to gain benefits that place-based,historic sites can provide, due to an inability to commemorate spaces that have shapedLGBTQ+ history in significant ways. This chapter explores the disparities betweenthe preservation and commemoration of significant LGBTQ+ spaces and the amountof funding distributed to these sites. As of 2016, LGBTQ+ sites comprised only 0.08percent of the 2,500 U.S. National Historic Landmarks and 0.005 percent of themorethan 90,000 places listed in the National Register of Historic Places. This represen-tation is well short of the share of American adults that identify as LGBTQ+ , whichin 2017 was approximately five percent of the United States population. In 2010 theAdministration of President Barack Obama launched the LGBTQHeritage Initiativeunder the National Historic Landmarks Program. This effort underscored a broadercommitment to include historically underrepresented groups, including LGBTQ+individuals. As a result, LGBTQ+ communities became eligible to receive fundingfor projects through the Underrepresented Community Grant Program. An analysisof the distribution of Underrepresented Community Grant Program funds revealedthat the LGBTQ+ community receives considerably less funding compared to otherunderrepresented communities. The findings from this study suggest that there is stilla significant amount of work that remains to be done to integrate LGBTQ+ historiesinto historic preservation programs that exist at various levels of programming (local,state, and federal).Keywords Historic preservation · Place-based identity · UnderrepresentedCommunity Grant · National Park Service · LGBTQ+ heritageC.

Bitterman15.1 Generations of Gay HistoryGay spaces across the United States are steeped in important and ephemeral history.However, the stories of these spaces—and the people that lived the struggle togain LGBTQ+ rights—are largely unrecorded, undocumented, and are not centrallycollected or archived beyond Wikipedia entries and oral histories. Many gay placesand gay neighborhoods have no formal means of recognition or historic protectionsuch as those that are available to other classifications of landmarks from state orfederal agencies. The pioneering generation that gave rise to the LGBTQ+ rightsmovement is aging and the time to capture the unprecedented—and largely undoc-umented—history of their efforts and struggle is endangered. As this generation ofLGBTQ+ elders ages and eventually passes on, the detailed histories, documents,and stories of this courageous generation will be lost and will become unavailable forfuture scholarly analysis or review (Bitterman and Hess 2016; Bitterman and Hess2021). With this loss, aspects of the history of the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights inthe United States stands a chance of becoming lost, forever, in the shuffle of history.It is vital that all groups are equally represented in their ability to memorialize andpreserve their own histories and culture as part of a broader cultural context. While“people survive the loss of places that support their identity,” (Mayes 2018) theseplaces take on a greater meaning. The phrase “many times, these places survive inmemory,” (Mayes 2018) suggests a type of “afterglow” which “denotes a post-placeas an imaginary-symbolic effect that percolates through deterritorialized networks”(Coffin 2021). In this way, “the continued presence of old places helps us know whowe are and who we may become in the future” (Mayes 2018).Late in the Obama administration (2014–2017) a United States Federal effort,through the National Park Service as part of the U.S. Department of the Interior—endeavored to identify, commemorate, and landmark sites that were significant tothe LGBTQ+ struggle for civil rights across the United States—began to see someunrecognized work start to gain traction (U.S. Department of the Interior 2014a).This effort built upon an emerging heritage effort that began in the 1960s throughlegislation focusing on the preservation of significant sites in the built environmentof special historic value. However, in the years following the Obama administrationstewardship, the Federal effort to identify, landmark, and protect LGBTQ+ heritagesites has been de-prioritized at the Federal level. As discussed later in this chapter,certain U.S. states, such as New York, have stepped into fill the post-Obama Federalvoid by identifying, commemorating, and protecting LGBTQ+ heritage sites withinstate boundaries.Efforts to commemorate and landmark significant LGBTQ+ sites become part ofthe history and ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ civil rights. These civil rights havehistorically been explicitly denied by both government and society (National ParkService 2019b; Garretson 2018). LGBTQ+ spaces, though important to LGBTQ+people, belong to everyone and are part of a diverse and rich history, extendingbeyond the specific history of LGBTQ+ individuals. Evidence demonstrates that thepreservation of historic sites allows for future generations to benefit from intangibles15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 341related to community and identity (Mayes 2018). Historic sites allow for people todefine who they are, to identify a sense of self, and to feel as though they belong to awelcoming community or a distinct effort or movement (Wood 1999; Mayes 2018;Zinn 2014).The preservation of historically significant sites extends beyond maintaining oldbuildings or installing commemorative plaques at important sites. Historically signif-icant LGBTQ+ sites have the ability to impact generations of people, their identity,and their lives by providing LGBTQ+ individuals and others with a source of inspira-tion and motivation (Bitterman and Hess 2021; Hess and Bitterman 2021). However,the LGBTQ+ community has been unable to gain the intangible benefits that place-based, historic sites can provide, due to an inability of the LGBTQ+ communityto memorialize and commemorate spaces that have been significant to shaping itshistory. In this way, the preservation of historic LGBTQ+ sites is more significantthan just the physicality of place. The importance of preserving significant LGBTQ+sites and the benefits of place-based history are explained by LaFrank (2020), theNewYork State Parks & Sites Historian for the NewYork State Historic PreservationOffice:This is helping real people to appreciate not only their history, but to appreciate and lovethemselves, to accept themselves, to find community with other people like themselves, andjust to be themselves. In other words, to erase all of the old hiding and shame, and I don’twant to go so far as to say it, but I think it saved people’s lives. It seems to me that this goesway beyond preservation. Preserving people and preserving communities is just not the sameas putting a plaque on an old house, not that I’m against that, I’ve hung my share of plaques.But it provides a more expansive view of history that benefits all of us. And so, the ideaof expanding history to include everybody’s story and everybody’s history. It helps peopleto validate their own lives, appreciate their own lives, and appreciate each other. (LaFrank2020)In thinking about moving forward, it is necessary to understand the importance foreveryone, regardless of how they identify, to be seen.The effort to preserve and commemorate sites significant to LGBTQ+ history hasbeen ongoing for nearly fifty years. In 1995, urban historian and architect DoloresHayden hoped for an expansive social history of place that included ethnicity andgender, and that would be transformative, “redefining the mainstream experience,and making visible some of its forgotten parts” (Hayden 1997: xi–xii). In increasingthe use of Federal funding to support historic preservation, Hayden finds a mandatefor a more expansive history by referring to Gans (Gans 1975: 33) “private citizensare of course entitled to save their own past, but when preservation becomes a publicact, supported with public funds, it must attend to everyone’s past.” This includesthe past of LGBTQ+ people, whose lives and experiences have in some cases, beenactively erased (National Park Service 2019b: 02-12-13).Hayden andGans argue thatif preservation is a public act, supported by public funding, then preservation shouldbe attentive towards everyone’s past. However, if this is indeed the case, then whydoes funding seem to be limited and only minimally allocated to LGBTQ+ sites, yetother types of heritage sites receive more funding for nominations to be written andsites to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places or as a National Historic342 C. Miller and A. BittermanLandmark? We argue that the commemoration of historically significant LGBTQ+sites encompasses a degree of importance beyond simply preserving history throughthe stories of the sites themselves, but that preservation and commemoration becomesa way to recognize people through the process of celebrating place. However, whenthat celebration and commemoration of those sites remain untold or systemicallysilenced, the history does not remain unknown, but rather acts as a method of socialexclusion and oppression.15.1.1 Violence and CommemorationThe United States is home to more than 1,000 battlefields from the French & IndianWar, the War of 1812, The American Revolution, and the American Civil War(Civil War Sites Advisory Commission 1993; Gossett and Mitchell 2007).1 Manybattlefields commemorate the violent evolution of the fight for equality, recognition,and freedom of every American citizen. The preservation of these battlefields ismaintained by various government agencies across the United States.Violence and conflict similarly punctuate the LGBTQ+ struggle for recognitionand equality (Hanhardt 2013). Sadly,many of the sites that could and arguably shouldbe commemorated in the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights have dark or violent histories.These places are the battlefields upon which struggles for civil rights were fought.The suffering of many valiant LGBTQ+ individuals made possible the freedoms andlegal protections enjoyed today. None of these sites are presently commemorated orsupported by government agencies, except for perhaps one of the most known, TheStonewall Inn in New York City, which was the site of groundbreaking riots duringthe late 1960s that spilled out into the streets (Duberman 2019) and spurred a helpedinitiate significant gay rights movements during a period of sexual liberation (Carteret al. 1999).2Other sites of violence towards LGBTQ+ individuals include:• The UpStairs Lounge, a gay bar located in the French Quarter of New Orleans,Louisiana, was site to one of the most horrific arson attacks on June 24,1973, resulting in the deaths of 32 people (University of New Orleans HistoryDepartment 2012).1Sites that are associated with wars fought on American soil have been identified, surveyed, andassessed through the American Battlefield Preservation Program (ABPP) established by the Secre-tary of the Interior in 1991. The Civil War Sites Advisory Commission, which was establishedby Congress in 1990, has identified 384 principal Civil War battlefields (Civil War Sites AdvisoryCommission 1993). The National Park Service has identified and documented 677 significant sitesassociated with the War of 1812 and the Revolutionary War (Gossett and Mitchell 2007).2One of the requirements for sites to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places is the“50-year rule.” This standard demonstrates chronological boundaries that have been constructed bythe United States Secretary of the Interior to filter out newer sites that have not reached “historicalsignificance” (Sprinkle Jr. 2007).15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 343• A desolate site on Snowy View Road in Laramie, Wyoming where 21-year-oldMatthew Shepard was the victim of one of the most notorious U.S. hate crimescentered around homophobia. Shepard was viciously beaten, tortured, and left todie by convicted murderers Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, who wereaided and enabled by Chasity Vera Pasley and Kristen Leann Price, all of whomwere in their early 20s (Sheerin 2018).• And more recently, the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando which was the location of thesecond-worst mass shooting by a single gunman in United States history on June12, 2016, resulted in the deaths of 49 people and the injury of 53 others (Beckett2016).Violence toward LGBTQ+ people has occurred in various places. Many of thesesites remain unidentified and potentially unknown for those who were too young, notborn, or unaware of events as they happened. Immediately following tragic events, thepublic often demonstrates support by setting up makeshift of temporary memorialsthat sometimes persist for years; however, the effort to have these sites commem-orated and preserved—officially—especially at a state and national level has beenchallenging. This effort is important in order to remember the lives—and the indi-viduals—that were lost. Landmarking and commemorating these sites ensures thatthe memory of those who lost their lives in the battle for LGBTQ+ rights are notforgotten. While meaning and importance of the sites endures for generations tocome, the remembrance of these tragedies helps to avoid similar acts of violence in thefuture. However, commemorating sites of LGBTQ+ violence and struggle remainsa challenge, as the United States government spends significantly more resources tocommemorate and maintain battlefields than LGBTQ+ sites, which comparativelyreceive precious little funding or support.15.2 Significant LGBTQ+ SitesThe commemoration of LBGTQ + sites is an important component of the broaderAmerican historical narrative, and is vital for the LGBTQ+ community to identify asignificant role in its shared history as well as to educate others about the strugglefor LGBTQ+ rights and freedoms. A statement from the co-founders of the NYCLGBT Historic Sites Project highlights the importance of place-based identity andthe preservation of physical sites associated with LGBTQ+ history:We’re interested in tangible heritage and what that means and the interpretation of it. But theintangible benefits for people are profound. For instance, a kid coming out or who is afraidto go to a Pride March can read about these places in the privacy of their own home, onthe computer or on a mobile device. This information gives access to people that otherwisewould not be able, for various reasons, to go and see these sites, or to explore their ownhistories. If I was that kid, it would have helped knowing that there is this rich history. It’snot just that Stonewall was a riot and there was a gay movement that resulted. You are able tolook at New York in a different way and really understand your connection to it emotionallyand historically. That is profound. (Dolkart and Lustbader 2020)344 C. Miller and A. BittermanElsewhere in this book, scholars explain how gay places matter (Ghaziani 2021, Hessand Bitterman 2021), and we argue in this chapter that historically significant gayplaces also matter. Physical historic sites encourage place-based and in situ recogni-tion, tourism, and commemoration by allowing individuals to find deeper connectionsand feel a sense of belonging and identity that they might not otherwise experience.This is especially the case with minority groups, including sexual minorities underthe LGBTQ+umbrella.Whenminority groups are able to feel connected to a physicalspace, these sites then have the potential to become places of community, acceptance,and belonging.The cultural significance of LGBTQ+ sites varies. Some LGBTQ+ historic sitesare buildings or locations, such as the Stonewall Inn. In other instances, the sites areslightly larger and encompass neighborhoods or parts of neighborhoods with a prox-imity to or concentration of historically significant LGBTQ+sites, such asGreenwichVillage in NewYork City, which surrounds Christopher Street. Occasionally, the siteis an entire historically significant neighborhood, like the Castro district in San Fran-cisco. Each of these types of site offers a unique degree of importance to the broaderLGBTQ+ historical narrative and intersects a still larger contextual American histor-ical narrative. For example, lessons learned about sexual health safety from gayneighborhoods during the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the 1980s spread quickly acrossgay neighborhoods throughout the United States and then more slowly into main-streamAmerican society (Bitterman and Hess 2021; Hess and Bitterman 2021). Thisincubation and transference is important for remembrance and commemoration, notonly for LGBTQ+ individuals, but for a broader and inclusive cultural heritage andpublic health history.As noted, many historically significant LGBTQ+ sites are located in or near gayneighborhoods. A sense of place and pride in place becomes more significant, espe-cially as gay neighborhoods experience “de-gaying” due to gentrification and demo-graphic change (Bitterman and Hess 2021; Hess 2019, Spring 2021). Supporting thecommemoration of places steeped in LGBTQ+ history—private residences, bars,cafes, or parks—enables these places to become places of community celebrationand focal points for gay neighborhoods to strengthen or potentially for new gayneighborhoods to emerge (Kinahan and Ruther 2020).15.2.1 LGBTQ+ Heritage InitiativeThe United States National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 established the preser-vation of historic and archaeological sites within the United States, resulting in thecreation of various entities managed by the National Park Service: National Registerof Historic Places (NRHP or NR), the National Historic Landmarks (NHL) list, and15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 345State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPO) (U.S. Department of the Interior 1966).3Through these programs, the United States government commemorates varioussignificant heritage sites that represent and reflect the diverse American population(National Park Service 2019c). However, LGBTQ+ individuals are largely under-represented by these efforts. Place-based programs orchestrated by the U.S. NationalPark Service are significant to the narrative of United States history and Americanpeople and culture, but fall well short of representing all people and narratives. Toameliorate this shortfall, the LGBTQHeritage Initiative programwas enacted in 2014by the National Park Service for a number of minority communities that are under-represented in the National Register of Historic Places and the National HistoricLandmarks listings, including: African American, American Latina/Latino, AsianAmerican and Pacific Islander, Disabled, Indigenous People, Women, and LGBTQ+individuals. Through this effort, the National Park Service has begun to take actionto tell “the history of all Americans in all of its diversity and complexity” (NationalPark Service 2019d:1). At present, LGBTQ+ sites make up only 0.08 percent ofthe 2,500 National Historic Landmarks and 0.005 percent of the more than 90,000places on the National Register of Historic Places as of 2016 (National Park Service2019b). This representation is well short of the share of American adults that identifyas LGBTQ+, which in 2017 was approximately 5 percent (Newport 2018).15.2.2 Protecting American LGBTQ+ HeritageIn November 1999, the United States Congress enacted the National Park SystemNew Area Study Act of 2000 which directed the U.S. Secretary of the Interior toconduct a series of special resource studies.4 The Civil Rights Framework for Iden-tifying Significant Sites, completed in 2002 and revised in 2008, lays out a planfor studies to focus specifically on civil rights sites at a multi-state level, leading toa call for projects that would address the underrepresentation of certain groups inthe National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmarks programs(Fig. 15.1) (National Park Service 2008, 2019b).In 2010, the Administration of President Barack Obama launched the Lesbian,Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Heritage Initiative under theNational Historic Landmarks Program (U.S. Office of the Press Secretary 2016) andby so doing, underscored a broader commitment to include historically underrep-resented groups, including LGBTQ+ individuals and communities. The four goalsof the LGBTQ Heritage Initiative include (1) increasing listings in the NationalRegister of Historic Places, (2) identifying, documenting, and nominating National3The National Register of Historic Places recognizes historical significance at local, state, andnational levels while the National Historic Landmark program acknowledges exceptional nationalsignificance (National Park Service 2019b).4TheNewAreaStudyAct of 2000 (S. 1349) fallswithinPublicLaw106-113,AppendixC, “NationalPark Service Studies Act of 1999”.346 C. Miller and A. BittermanFig. 15.1 Cover of “Civil Rights inAmerica:AFramework for Identifying Significant Sites.”Coverof the report features a number of groups which are underrepresented in NRHP and NHL programs,including Barbara Gittings and Randy Wicker in picket line outside Independence Hall, Philadel-phia, PA, July 4, 1966, carrying a sign that says “Homosexuals should be judged as individuals”(Source National Park Service, 2008, public domain image)15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 347Historic Landmarks associated with LGBTQ+ heritage, (3) engaging the communityto identify additional sites associated with LGBTQ+ history and heritage, and (4) toencourage National Park Service units to interpret associated stories (National ParkService 2019b: 02-6).Increasing the number of listings of LGBTQ+-associated properties in theNational Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmarks facilitatespreservation of the significant stories of many of these sites and properties. Not onlywill this initiative help to identify new sites, but this effort will also support the docu-mentation and nomination of other LGBTQ+ significant sites. In addition, sites thatmay already be listed have the opportunity to “come out” as LGBTQ+ sites and havethe stories of these places publicly unveiled and enriched through community recog-nition. This will allow for more LGBTQ+-associated histories to be revealed andshared, and by so doing, allow for more places to hold meaningful connections forall people, thereby increasing the capacity for place-based identity of LGBTQ+ indi-viduals. Additionally, the LGBTQ Heritage Initiative also aims to engage scholarsand LGBTQ+ community members who can work to identify possible sites associ-ated with LGBTQ+ heritage and history. This effort will lead to the nomination ofproperties for various levels of recognition and preservation at the local, state, andnational level.Community involvement engages not only professional historic preservationistsand academics, but also those involved with making history at these sites, as wellas armchair historians, champions, and activists in uncovering the untold or lesser-known stories of the LGBTQ-significance of these sites. This inclusive approachallows citizens to shape who gets to tell the story and history of a community orplace.Ultimately the initiative attempts to encourage theNational ParkService and allaffiliated agencies at the local, state, and national level to begin to interpret LGBTQ+stories that are associated with the sites that already are maintained, preserved, andprotected. Even if LGBTQ+ history is not yet formally documented, the groupswho oversee these places are encouraged to begin to research and disseminate thesestories at relevant sites using various approaches including, tours, didactic signage,pamphlets, and other educational materials.Memorializing, commemorating, and preserving LGBTQ+ sites is not only vitalto the education and celebration of the LGBTQ+ community, but also creates aphysical relation to and experience in places for people to make distinct connectionsto history. Memorializing LGBTQ+ spaces creates tangible, visceral experienceswith place-based history that can provide people with connections to an identity, amoment, and a story. LGBTQ+ historic spaces should not be considered differentlythan other historically significant sites, and thus should be considered on the sameterms and eligible for equal funding and support.348 C. Miller and A. Bitterman15.2.3 Aim of Landmarks DedicationAlthough the original preservation act became law in 1966—44 years prior to theLGBTQHeritage Initiative—the collective public voice of the LGBTQ+ communitywas, at that time, still emerging, gaining acceptance, and struggling for equality. Then,the fledgling and emergent LGBTQ+ community was thus unable to collectivelydevote time and energy into identifying and preserving places that were historicallysignificant or meaningful as they struggled to gain a collective voice and unified iden-tity. Even though gay places were listed on the National Register of Historic Placesand the National Historic Landmark lists after the National Historic PreservationAct of 1966, the explicit connection to LGBTQ+ heritage was almost always left outof inventory and nomination efforts (National Park Service 2019b). Oftentimes, theconnection to LGBTQ+ heritage and historywas never explicitly written in inventoryand nomination documents, but rather only carried out through local knowledge ofthe site and oral storytelling on site tours or didactic signage on-site. For this reason,many of the current efforts to commemorate LGBTQ+ places are not necessarilyto write nominations to nominate new sites, but rather to explicitly memorialize theLGBTQ+ connections in already-nominated or listed sites.The LGBTQ Heritage Initiative was expanded in 2014 to include a new themestudy to identify places and events associated with LGBTQ+ Americans that wouldbe included in the National Register of Historic Places and listed as National HistoricLandmarks (U.S. Department of the Interior 2014a). As mainstream acceptanceof LGBTQ+ individuals continues to grow, and as expression of sexual orienta-tion and gender representation has diversified in recent years, the resulting increasein public support for LGBTQ+ rights and civil liberties has enabled bolder andinclusive heritage efforts. Likewise, the body of LGBTQ+ scholarship continuesto increase, providing critical support and information necessary to commemorateLGBTQ+ spaces. Sites that were previously not celebrated for their prominenceand significance in LGBTQ+ culture and history have lately been designated as“lavender landmarks” (National Park Service 2019b) and by June 2016, ten placeswere included on the National Register of Historic Places or have been designatedas National Historic Landmarks because of their association with or significance toLGBTQ+ history (National Park Service Service 2019b: 02-7). These sites includethe Stonewall National Monument (New York City, NY); Dr. Franklin E. KamenyResidence (Washington, DC); James Merrill House (Stonington, CT); CarringtonHouse (Fire Island Pines, NY); Cherry Grove Community House & Theater (CherryGrove, NY); The Henry Gerber House (Chicago, IL); Bayard Rustin Residence(New York, NY); Julius’ Bar (New York, NY); Edificio Comunidad de Orgullo Gayde Puerto Rico (AKAPride House; AKACasa Orgullo) (San Juan, Puerto Rico); andthe Furies Collective House (Washington, D.C.). Though efforts in the struggle forLGBTQ+ rights has occurred for decades, the efforts to identify, commemorate, andlandmark LGBTQ+ historically significant sites has begun only relatively recently(Fig. 15.2). This delay is explained by LaFrank (2020), the New York State Parks &Sites Historian for the New York State Historic Preservation Office:15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 349Fig. 15.2 Timeline showing progression of LGBTQ+preserved sites. The sites listed in the timelineare those that are either on the NRHP or NHL, intentionally designated for their importance as ahistorically significant LGBTQ site (Source Timeline by authors)350 C. Miller and A. BittermanI think it parallels what was happening in society. It took a long time for LGBTQ rights. Firstwe had “don’t ask, don’t tell” during Clinton and then we gradually had same sex marriage.And whether we like it or not, these things take a long time; society takes a while to acceptthings like this and for people to become understanding and get used to it. (LaFrank 2020)15.2.4 Initial Results of the LGBTQ Heritage InitiativeOne of the early outcomes of the LGBTQ Heritage Initiative was the creation ofa national map of places across the country significant to LGBTQ+ history andheritage (Fig. 15.3). This map is part of an ongoing crowd-sourced exercise in whichthe public is encouraged by the LGBTQ Heritage Initiative and the National ParkService to contribute specific sites to the inclusive narrative of the LGBTQ+ commu-nity (National Park Service 2019e). While initiated as part of the LGBTQ HeritageInitiative, this map is maintained as a joint effort of the National Park Service, Quist,and the Rainbow Heritage Network. A number of sites appear on this map thatwere previously nominated for being historically significant (based on National ParkFig. 15.3 Map created using HistoryPin.org as a part of the NPS LGBTQ Heritage Initiative,part of an ongoing project in which people are asked to contribute to this inclusive story of theLGBTQ community in order to support an inclusive history (Source National Park Service, Quist,and Rainbow Heritage Network, 2015, pubic domain image)15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 351Service criteria for theNationalRegister ofHistoric Places orNationalHistoric Land-mark listings),5 however, the relevance of these sites as LGBTQ+-specific historicalsites was mostly omitted on original nomination forms.The LGBTQ+mapping project helps tomake LGBTQ+ heritage and historymorevisible. The grassroots, bottom-up approach to collecting significant history is partof LGBTQ+ heritage that has allowed for inclusion and connectivity in the processof making America’s history more inclusive. As of 2020 the LGBTQ+ mappingproject has listed 1,161 sites (National Park Service, Quist, and Rainbow HeritageNetwork 2016) and collects additional information about existing sites that havebeen previously listed, as well as information about potential sites that have notyet been identified. The novel, collective, and contributory method for assemblinginformation ensures broad access to a thorough, inclusive history about LGBTQ+places and ensures the history and importance of these places is not lost (NationalPark Service 2019a).Another significant advancement stemming from the LGBTQ Heritage Initia-tive was the publication of a 1,262-page theme study by the National Park Servicethat documents the national LGBTQ+ experience (Fig. 15.4) in 2016. This docu-ment represents the first account of the LGBTQ+ community in the history ofthe United States (National Park Service 2019b) by the U.S. Federal Government.This 2016 LGBTQ theme study utilized a new methodology—compared to that ofprevious theme studies—to effectively illustrate the degree to which the LGBTQ+community has been underrepresented in the National Register of Historic Placesand National Historic Landmark programs. The 2016 LGBTQ theme study utilizedseveral methodological approaches including “modeling the telling of LGBTQhistory using place; a commitment to community, including being accessible anduseful and in recognizing many LGBTQ communities in the United States; theimportance of multiple voices; the need to acknowledge and respect identity; and theinclusion of difficult and painful histories” (National Park Service 2019b: 02-22-23).Typically, theme studies include previously listed places to illustrate how the prop-erties associated with the theme meet program requirements. In the case of the 2016LGBTQ theme study, however, this method proved to be ineffective because so few(only about ten) LGBTQ-inclusive sites were listed. The 2016 LGBTQ theme studymodels and demonstrates ways in which LGBTQ+ history could be recounted byusing place-based examples and providing information on how to link those historieswith National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmark programguidelines and requirements for the future listing of properties (National Park Service2019b).The 2016 LGBTQ theme study is organized into six sections (Introduction,Preserving LGBTQ History, Inclusive Stories, Themes, Places, and Legacy) andemphasizes central nature of the LGBTQ+ dynamic histories and experiences. Thestudy aims to connect the complex, multi-polar, intersectional histories of LGBTQ+5Specific details about NPS criteria for National Register of Historic Places listings (National ParkService Cultural Resources 1990) and National Historic Landmarks listings (National Park ServiceCultural Resources 1999).352 C.

BittermanFig. 15.4 Cover of “LGBTQ America: A Theme Study of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender,and Queer History,” a 1,262-page, multi-chapter report published in 2016 as part of the LGBTQHeritage Initiative (Source National Park Service 2019b, public domain image)15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 353communities to that of the broader United States history. Through the six in-depthsections, this theme study makes clear connections to broader American history,places, and landscapes throughout the country in ways that the LGBTQ+ commu-nity had previously been excluded. The manner by which the theme study beginsto illustrate connections that had not been explicit in the past makes the comple-tion and publication of the 2016 LGBTQ theme study an important first step towardincreasing the number of sites that commemorate and celebrate LGBTQ+ historyand heritage, increasing visibility and inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community. Thisinitial step, made possible by funding from the United States government, was asuccess which has gained much-needed traction and momentum for the LGBTQ+community toward a collective effort to uncover and tell the histories and experiencesof LGBTQ+ Americans.The significant work accomplished as a result of the 2016 LGBTQ theme studyand the effort to have LGBTQ+ sites intentionally listed in the National Register ofHistoric Places and National Historic Landmarks—for the reason of being signif-icant to LGBTQ+ history—is not just thanks to the people directly working onthese projects, but also to decades of tireless advocacy by the LGBTQ+ community,activists, and allies. These steps to make historic preservation more accessible, equi-table, and inclusive has resulted in the greater visibility and awareness of LGBTQ+untold histories through historic sites and structures, museums, interpretive sites, andcity streets.15.3 Current Status of the Preservation of LGBTQ+ SitesDespite important advances and structural support, according to the National ParkService Heritage data (2014–2019), no grant programs funded through the LGBTQHeritage Initiative currently support the research and/or preservation of individualLGBTQ+ historic sites (National Park Service 2019a). This arrangement differsfrom other historic preservation efforts in that some other preservation initiatives andprograms provide dedicated funding set aside for specific initiatives and programs.That is not to imply that LGBTQ+ sites cannot apply for awards from other, moregeneric pools of funding, but the means by which funding is available to protect,commemorate, and memorialize LGBTQ+ sites remains opaque. While sources offunding for LGBTQ+ sites do exist, the regulations and procedures for obtainingfunding are unusually cumbersome. For example, one extra burden required bymany of these funding sources is that the site is already listed as a National HistoricLandmark or is already included in the National Register of Historic Places, each alaborious effort in their own right. Some funding sources which remain available forLGBTQ+ historic sites outside of Federal programs include state and local govern-ments, private foundations, historic tax credits, historic trusts, and the National Trustfor Historic Preservation (National Park Service 2019a).Efforts to incorporate historically underrepresented groups in the NationalRegister of Historic Places and National Historic Landmark listings have been made354 C. Miller and A. Bittermanby the United States Congress by providing funding available to states through theUnderrepresentedCommunity (URC)Grant Program (National Park Service 2020b).Managed by the National Park Service and funded by the Historic Preservation Fund(HPF)6, the Underrepresented Community Grant Program was created to provideresources to traditionally underrepresentedgroups in theNationalRegister ofHistoricPlaces for projects including surveys and inventories of historic properties associ-ated with these communities (National Park Service 2019a, 2020b). The Under-represented Community Grant program guidelines indicate, “grants are awardedthrough a competitive process and do not require non-Federal match. Eligible appli-cants are limited to State Historic Preservation offices, Federally Recognized Tribes,Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian Organizations, and Certified Local Govern-ments” (National Park Service 2020b). Theoretically, these funds could be used bystate offices of historic preservation and other governmental agencies to protect andmemorialize LGBTQ+ sites.In each of the fiscal years 2014 through 2019, Congress appropriated $500,000for grants that provided funding for surveys, inventories, and the designation ofproperties associated with underrepresented communities in the National Registerof Historic Places and National Historic Landmark listings (National Park Service2014; U.S. Department of the Interior 2014b).7 See Fig. 15.5. The UnderrepresentedCommunity Grant Program made available a total of $750,000 in grant fundingfor the 2020 fiscal year. This grant program has provided funding to 75 projectsover the past six years (from 2014 to 2019) across 34 states (Table 15.1).8 A widerange of agencies have received funding from this grant program including, statedepartments and preservation offices, municipalities, indigenous tribes and villages,historic and archeological districts, and historical societies. The grant award perproject has ranged from $3,847 to $72,000 with projects being awarded an averageof $40,979 (the median project award was $43,158).9Since the beginning of the Underrepresented Community Grant Program in2014, approximately 10–18 projects have been awarded funding each year. Under-represented communities receiving funding for heritage projects over the past sixyears include LGBTQ+, African American, Indigenous communities, AmericanLatina/Latino, Asian American, and Pacific Islander, and Women. Table 15.2 andFig. 15.6 provide a summary of the number of projects each underrepresentedcommunity has received along with the total funding dollars per year per categoryand since the Underrepresented Community Grant began in 2014.6The Historic Preservation Tax Fund is not supported with tax dollars, but rather supported byrevenue from Federal oil leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (National Park Service 2020b).7Three projects in 2015 and one project in 2017 that listed multiple Underrepresented CommunityCategories. These are noted in italicized text.8Included in the 34 states is theDistrict of Columbia and the Federated States ofMicronesiaNationalGovernment.9The 2019 dataset for the Underrepresented Community Grant Program did not include the indi-vidual monetary awards distributed for each project, thus these values are calculated using thefigures from 2014 to 2018.15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 355Fig. 15.5 Number of Underrepresented Community Grants awarded per state from 2014 to 2019(Source Map by authors)Based on the analysis presented in Table 15.2 and Fig. 15.6, the LGBTQ+ commu-nity receives considerably less funding, both in terms of the number of projects (7.9percent of the total number of projects funded since 2014) as well as the amount offunding (8.4 percent of total available funding since 2014). In fact, all other commu-nities (except projects related to women) received more funding than the LGBTQ+group. It should also be noted that four of the 6.2 total projects related to LGBTQ+heritage have been part of a four-phase project forNewYorkCity (comprising over 50percent of the funding awarded to LGBTQ+ projects; approximately $125,000 out ofthe total $211,000). This is not to imply that funding is not necessarily being approvedfor projects related to the LGBTQ+ community, as the lack of projects funded couldbe related to a lack of applications for funding. However, anecdotal data implies thatindeed, LGBTQ+ projects do indeed receive considerably less funding, despite anotable number of applications.15.3.1 Constancy of ApplicationLGBTQ+-significant places and gay neighborhoods are now considered “worthpreserving” due to a heightened awareness as a result of increased media coverage356 C.

Therefore itis sensible to expect an increase in the rate in which sites are being intentionallylisted as LGBTQ+ sites. However, data indicates that rate of LGBTQ+ listingsin the National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmarks hasremained steady since the original effort to identify, commemorate, and landmarkthese sites during the Obama administration. While funding for the preservationof historically significant LGBTQ+ sites has continued—but has not increased—during the Trump administration (Dolkart and Lustbader 2020; Chibbaro Jr andLou 2018; LaFrank 2020), the outcome of these funding efforts remains uncertain.15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 361Table15.2TablesummarizingtheUnderrepresentedCommunity(URC)GrantAwardeesforeachunderrepresentedcommunityineachyearfrom2014to2019.Thetablealsoprovidesthetotalnumberofprojectsawardedanddollarsawardedforeachunderrepresentedcommunityfrom2014to2019SummaryofUnderrepresentedCommunity(URC)grantawardees(2014–2019)UnderrepresentedCommunityTotalperYearTotalSinceURCGrantBegan201420152016201720182019#USD#USD#USD#USD#USD#USD#USDLGBTQ+274,9990.211,000299,99900125,0001n/a6.2210,998AfricanAmerican3112,7882.95127,8474138,5253.5121,6005181,8936n/a24.45682,653Indigenous4180,7103.25152,153298,5186233,2704170,6926n/a25.25835,343AmericanLatina/Latino264,4531.257,0003112,9582.5114,360136,0001n/a10.7384,771AsianAmericanandPacificIslander267,0501.95126,000150,0000040,0003n/a8.95283,0501Women000.4526,00000130,500146,4151n/a3.45102,915362 C.

BittermanFig. 15.6 Total number of Underrepresented Community (URC)Grant projects awarded per under-represented community from 2014 to 2019 (top) and the total monetary URC Grant funds awardedper underrepresented community from 2014 to 2018 (bottom) (Source Graphs by authors)While funding through the Underrepresented Community Grant has continued andeven increased in order to fund more projects focused on preserving the heritage ofunderrepresented communities, muchwork remains for the preservation of LGBTQ+sites.Evidence of remaining work is evident through the sharp differences in levelsof funding and number of LGBTQ+ projects that have been awarded Underrepre-sented Community Grants compared to the much higher number of projects andmore sizable grant amounts awarded to projects for other underrepresented commu-nities. Whether it is due to systemic de-prioritizing LGBTQ+ projects, applicationbarriers for the nomination of LGBTQ+ sites, a low likelihood of acceptance, orthe fact that there is simply not enough capacity at the grassroots level to work onthese projects, the share of historically significant LGBTQ+ sites commemorated isunderwhelming. Considering thatmany of the significant LGBTQ+ sites are places ofviolence—just like the numerous battlefields that are meticulously preserved acrossthe United States—the amount of funding for LGBTQ+ sites is notably less to thatprovided for the preservation and commemoration of battlefields. Specifically, theAmerican Battlefield Preservation Planning (ABPP) Grant (which is just one of the15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 363many Federal funding sources for battlefields) has provided over $23 million since1996 towards preserving significant sites associated with wars on American soil(National Park Service 2020a), where efforts to commemorate, preserve, or memo-rialize LGBTQ+ sites under the Underrepresented Community Grant program (theonly Federal funding source currently available for LGBTQ+ sites) is one-tenth ofone percent of that level of support.15.4 The Future of Preserving the PastMirroring the fight for LGBTQ+ rights and equality, the process for preservinghistoric and culturally significant LGBTQ+ sites faces many systemic challenges.Though positive improvements have been made to the funding and protections ofLGBTQ+ sites, an opportunity for more significant progress remains. Thus, cele-bration of the LGBTQ+ communities and assistance in educating the public aboutthe ongoing campaign for LGBTQ+ rights and equality resides in the political viewsand persuasions of those in power. For now, it seems, a quiet effort to commemorateLGBTQ+ sites, begun under the Obama administration, has escaped budget cuts andscrutiny by the Trump administration.Despite the obvious inequities in the process of preserving LGBTQ+ sites ofhistorical significance, the effective bottom-up collaboration and grassroots approachled by local communities, groups, and organizations is notable to ensure the preser-vation and commemoration of LGBTQ+ sites. LGBTQ+ communities across theUnited States have shown leadership by beginning to identify sites that representhistoric and iconic value and are worthy of preservation (National Park Service2019b). An example of a successful bottom-up approach is the NewYork City LGBTHistoric Sites Project (Fig. 15.7), which has identified specific properties and loca-tions within the New York City metropolitan area that are significant in the strugglefor LGBTQ+ rights. The rich stories of these places were largely undocumentedat the time the original National Register of Historic Places inventory and nomina-tion forms were completed (Dolkart et al. 2015). The map provides public accessto a valuable and continually updated resource that enhances the existing landmarkstatus in a way that is specific to LGBTQ+ history (Dolkart et al. 2015). The NewYork City LGBT Historic Sites Project provides numerous interactive maps thatallow for people to explore this history through various themes and walking toursin order to work towards educating and inspiring future LGBTQ+ generations aboutthe community’s contributions to American history and the struggles it has enduredand overcome. The NewYork City LGBTHistoric Sites Project provides an exampleof a comprehensive project that could serve as a model for similar projects in othercities.Another similar grassroots effort advocating for the preservation and landmarkingof historically significant LGBTQ+ sites is the RainbowHeritage Network (NationalPark Service 2019b; Rainbow Heritage Network 2015). The Rainbow HeritageNetwork is a national organization dedicated to the preservation and recognition of364 C. Miller and A. BittermanFig. 15.7 Map created by NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project, a scholarly initiative that beganin August 2015 as a way to provide the public with a resource in which they can broaden theirknowledge of LGBThistory (SourceDolkart, AndrewS.,KenLustbader, Jay Shockley, andAmandaDavis. 2015)LGBTQ+ sites, history, and heritage. This group provides opportunities to network,advocate for sites, construct and maintain archives, discuss preservation initiatives,and receive assistance with building connections between repositories and donors ofhistorical material (Rainbow Heritage Network 2015). The efforts put forth by theRainbow Heritage Network have allowed for several smaller grassroots groups toconnect through the compilation of a comprehensive directory in addition to orga-nizing a list of resources intended to support local preservation advocacy efforts atvarious levels and regions throughout the country.Unfortunately, bottom-up, grassroots approaches to preservation of LGBTQ+spaces and neighborhoods have certain limitations. Using grassroots processes forcommemorating historically significant LGBTQ+ places involves not just under-standing and interpreting historical sites, but doing so within the context of amarginalized, statistically invisible, silenced LGBTQ+ population (Frisch 2021;Hess and Bitterman 2021). Therefore, much of the work that must be completedinvolves amending existing nominations for the National Register of Historic Placesand ensuring that LGBTQ+ history is included in future nominations and ensuringapplicants are aware of the ability to seek project funding based on LGBTQ+ histor-ical status or significance. Changing the manner by which LGBTQ+ sites could be15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 365listed as historic sites will involve proper education on how to properly amend andcomplete nominations to include the complete and uninhibited history, not simplythe history that people believe will be accepted by the National Park Service and thegeneral public. Unfortunately, reviewing all of the previously submitted nominationson the National Register of Historic Places and National Historic Landmark listingsto see what sites might have omitted ties to LGBTQ+ histories is a huge undertaking.This effort will require both a substantial investment of time and significant resourcesto fund the work that needs to be completed.The burden and expense of identifying and landmarking LGBTQ+ significantsites, buildings, and neighborhoods with either the existing National Register ofHistoric Places or National Historic Landmark program is initiated and performedlocally, thus resulting in a time lag between site identification and the site receivinglandmark status. Delays and time lags can expose the nomination and designationprocess to political pressure. The process of landmarking a site, regardless of level(local, state, or federal) is costly and lengthy, thus emphasizing the need for LGBTQ+community members, allies, and advocates to become educated with the nominationprocess and develop skills necessary to assist with preparing landmark nominations.These supporters must be willing to remain connected to the process for a longduration. The development of relevant skills is vital to the progress of incorporatingLGBTQ+ histories into previous and future nominations. Since anyone can prepareand submit nomination forms, the review of draft nominations by state and federalhistoric preservation office staff is vital tomaintaining quality control. Unfortunately,administration of these programs have been chronically understaffed (National ParkService 2019b) which compounds barriers to securing funding for LGBTQ+ sites.Broadening the scope of those who are able to share their knowledge regardingLGBTQ+ contexts and histories, and ensuring that there is engagement of LGBTQ+expertise during the review process, will allow for the increased contribution andvisibility of historically significant gay places.While various steps are being taken simultaneously at local, state, and nationallevels, several steps can be addressed in order to ensure that LGBTQ+ sites areappropriately celebrated and commemorated so that future generations may connectwith these important heritage touchpoints and histories, including:• Encourage LGBTQ+ groups to apply for funding and educate grassroots enti-ties on how to engage the application process. Because other types of projects(i.e., historic preservation projects receiving tax credits) tend to be more lucrativecommercial undertakings, historic preservationists tend to focus more on thesetypes of nominations rather than cultural or heritage projects.• Ensure written nominations (National Historic Landmarks or National Registerof Historic Places) focus equally on site history and physical attributes of sites.The preservation of significant sites is not just about the site looking “historicallypretty.”366 C. Miller and A. Bitterman• Encourage the integration of LGBTQ+history into school curriculums and preser-vation survey work. This is often challenging, especially if a historic preser-vationist is not completely familiar with a site and is apt to overlook “untoldhistories.”• Focus efforts on recording oral histories before the aging LGBTQ+ populationsare gone forever.• Encourage more professional organizations, like businesses, corporations, andinstitutions, to be more receptive to putting forward LGBTQ+ preservation andcommemmoration initiatives as priorities.• Incorporate LGBTQ+ heritage more into the daily work of preservationists,educate the public about LGBTQ+ history when appropriate on tours, andintegrate LGBTQ+ stories into projects and written nominations.• Expand the celebration of LGBTQ+ history and heritage beyond the months ofJune (LGBTQ+ Pride Month) and October (LGBTQ+ History Month) in theUnited States.• Utilize new communication tools through social media to repackage otherwisestatic historic documents and nominations to relate history and heritage to peopletoday.While a consistent effort towards commemorating historically significant gayplaces has been made, a significant amount of work remains to incorporate andintegrate LGBTQ+ histories into the various historic preservation programs at alllevels of programming (local, state, and federal).15.5 Takeaway MessagesThe analysis in this chapter of work being done to commemorate and preservehistorically significant LGBTQ+ sites produces the following three takeawaymessages:Takeaway message 1. Creativity should be used in understanding and applyingnomination criteria to LGBTQ+ spaces; the Stonewall nomination utilized theframework in which battlefield nominations are written.One of the ways in which more LGBTQ+ histories can be incorporated intoNational Register and National Historic Landmark nominations—and in historicpreservation work more generally—is through employing more creative ways bywhich significant LGBTQ+ places are situated and contextualized in historicalnarrative. Often for preservationists the propensity to disregard buildings or sitesthat are not “architecturally rich” or “aesthetically pleasing” becomes evident inthe nomination process that too often focuses on the physicality of a structureduring its period of significance. This is not to say, however, that sites that areno longer extant should not be nominated, but rather culturally rich sites shouldbe considered with a different perspective, similar to how the nomination for15 Commemorating Historically Significant … 367Stonewall ingeniously utilized a framework typically used to write and nominatebattlefields. This creative approach better captures the historical significance in thestruggle for LGBTQ+ rights and produced a successful nomination. Just as with abattlefield nomination, the Stonewall nomination described different stagings andmovement of the two sides (in this case police and LGBTQ+ protesters). Addi-tionally, the authors interviewed numerous people andwove together a descriptiveaccount of how the uprising occurred in such a way that the written nominationdocument left a reader with little doubt that the site was historically significant(Carter et al. 1999).Takeaway message 2. Funding is available for commemorating and preservingLGBTQ+ sites, however, the mechanism to apply for funding is not widelydisseminated among smaller groups or organizations.Although funding for the nomination of sites to be listed on the National RegisterofHistoric Places and asNationalHistoric Landmarks is available, themechanismto apply for funding is unfortunately not widely publicized in amanner that allowsfor those who do not work in the field of preservation to learn about the avail-ability of funding, the funding cycle, or how to apply. While there are LGBTQ+groups that may be interested in applying for preservation funds to commemo-rate historically significant places of LGBTQ+ heritage, the application processremains an unwieldy task that requires significant time and resources. The processof researching and preparing nominations is not simple, and completing the appli-cation process is fully dependent on the work of preservationists, professionals,activists, and engaged community members, ideally with oversight and assistancefrom state historic preservation offices. State historic preservation offices havebecome inundated with projects that are more profitable for developers, includingpreservation projects receiving tax credits, and these typically take precedence.A common perception among state historic preservation office officials is thatthe time to work on process civil rights projects—such as nominations for sitesrelated to and significant for the LGBTQ+ community—is sparse.Takeaway message 3. LGBTQ+ organizations are applying for funding andwant to landmark significant LGBTQ+ places.Moving forward with commemorating historically significant gay places, it isimportant now more than ever to raise public awareness about the LGBTQ+community’s contributions throughout the history of the United States and alsoimportant to draw attention to the struggles LGBTQ+ individuals have enduredto advance the fight for equality, civil rights, and acceptance. The preservation ofhistorically significant LGBTQ+ sites endeavors to make the invisible visible sothat future generations are able to learn, commemorate, and celebrate LGBTQ+community and heritage.368 C.

Academic studies tend to focus on the new livesthat are being led beyond the gayborhood and the diminished distinctiveness of theterritories left behind (e.g. Ghaziani 2014). In contrast, this chapter explores thepossibility that gayborhoods can continue to influence sociospatial dynamics, evenafter their physical presence has diminished or disappeared altogether. Individualsand collectives may still be inspired by the memories, representations, and imag-inaries previously provided by these erstwhile places. Indeed, the metaphor of anon-heteronormative diaspora relies on an ‘origin’ from which a cultural networkhas dispersed. In this sense gayborhoods can continue to function as post-places,as symbolic anchors of identity that operate even if they no longer exist in a mate-rial form, even if they are used simply as markers of ‘how far the diaspora hascome’. The proposition that gayborhoods are becoming post-places could be morefully theorized in a number of ways, but the approach here is to adapt Deleuze andGuattari’s (1987: 22) notion of plateaus, which denote a “region of intensities whosedevelopment avoids any orientation towards a culmination point or external end”.From this perspective gayborhoods are not spatial phenomena that reach a climax ofconcentration and then disappear through dissipation. Instead, they can be describedas becoming more intense and concrete in the latter half of the twentieth centurybefore gradually fading after the new millennium as they disperse gradually into adiaspora as memories, habits, and so forth. Put another way, non-climactic gaybor-hoods leave ‘afterglows’, affects that continue to exert geographical effects in thepresent and near future. This conceptualization is consequential for theory, practice,and political activism, and ends the main body of this edited volume on a moreambitious note.Keywords Deleuze · Guattari · Place · Plateau · Afterglow · Assemblage ·LGBTQ+J.

Coffin16.1 IntroductionThe sexualization of space, the spatialization of sexuality, and the relations of bothto gender identities and gendered spaces; taken together, these phenomena representa complex area of inquiry that has inspired decades of scholarship across academicdisciplines.1 Looming large in these literatures are gayborhoods, concentrationsof people, practices, and places that are associated with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,Trans*, Queer, and other non-heteronormative (LGBTQ+)2 cultures. Gayborhoodsare typically dominated by commercial environments (such as bars) and events (likePride festivals), often attracting the attention ofmainstreambrands (ofwhich there aretoo many to enumerate), so it is unsurprising that marketing scholars and consumerresearchers have taken an especial interest in these districts (see Coffin et al. 2016).However, recent discussions have focused on the decline, and even disappearance,of gayborhoods as LGBTQ+ people no longer need spaces of (self-) segregation inan era of increasing societal acceptance (Ghaziani 2014, 2015) and deterritorializingtechnologies like dating applications for smartphones (Miles 2021). Yet, academicresearch suggests that the spatial diffusion of LGBTQ+ cultures away from gaybor-hoods does not signal a destructive de-spatialization but rather a more dynamic seriesof ongoing re-spatializations across a multitude of spaces (Bitterman 2020), manyof which are peripatetic, ephemeral, and inconspicuous to varying degrees (Visconti2008). It appears that the sociospatial dynamism of sexuality and gender appears tobe in a “transitional stage toward a post-gay, post-binary-identity era” (Hess 2019:230), in which the future of gayborhoods becomes more, rather than less, interestingfor researchers of all kinds.Many chapters in this edited volume have noted how gayborhoods have changedin the past and how they are continuing to change in the present, explicating theirever-changing role as places with personal and political significance. None of thesechapters can provide a definitive prediction about the future of gayborhoods, notleast because each is shaped by cultural, political, and infrastructural conditions that“are often unique to each place and must be investigated thoughtfully and care-fully” (Bitterman 2020: 99). As so pertinently pointed out by Visser (2013: 269),“current Western theory is not only insufficient to explain gay spatial realities inthe Western/Northern context itself, but it totally ignores (and is irrelevant to) the1I hesitate to invoke the term ‘interdisciplinary’ here. Many authors develop their arguments withintheir own scholarly silos and most multi-author edited volumes anchor themselves within particularacademic arenas (e.g. DeLamater and Plante 2015). I do not present this observation as a criticism—disciplinary depth can be just as valuable as anti-disciplinary aggregation. However, to mymind thepresent volume is perhaps one of the first to be truly inter-disciplinary in its ambition to assembleauthors from all sorts of scholarly backgrounds.2Negotiations regarding the correct nomenclature for non-normative sexualities and genders areongoing among academics and non-academics (Ghaziani 2011). In this chapter I follow Coffinet al. (2019) in adopting LGBTQ+ as an acronym that carefully counterbalances succinctness andinclusiveness. However, I urge my contemporary readership to watch this space keenly. Futurereaders are likely to find LGBTQ+ outmoded, just as using ‘gay’ as an overarching term seemssomewhat awkward (to me, at least) at the present time.16 Plateaus and Afterglows: Theorizing the Afterlives … 373majority gay population located in very different and diverse settings elsewhere”.For example, Eeckhout et al. (2021) demonstrate how Antwerp, a typically North-Westerly cultural context, did not develop a gayborhood in the North American senseof the term.The conditions that constitute gayborhoods are also subject to change. Forinstance, the narrative of decline and disappearance is predicated on the assumptionofwidespread social liberalization, a trendwhich iswell-evidencedbut not inexorable(Pinker 2018). In recent years this historical trend has been challenged by the riseof populist politics and cultural xenophobia in the ostensibly ‘post-gay’ developedworld, as well as regressions elsewhere (Coffin et al. 2019). Acknowledging thesecontingencies, this chapter cannot aspire to a sweeping theorization of gayborhoodsand their future; rather, I adopt the more humble ambition of providing an alternativeline of thinking that may help scholars to sidestep the dualism of ‘decline’ versus‘endurance’ that implicitly underpins much of the existing literature (Coffin et al.2016).This alternative line of thinking is encapsulated in the concept of the ‘post-place’,which denotes howadisappearing gayborhood (or other physical locale) can continueto exert an influence, albeit an altered one, on the sociospatial dynamics of urbanconurbations (and beyond). To help develop a more sophisticated conceptualizationof post-places, I turn to the post-phenomenological perspectives provided by GillesDeleuze and Félix Guattari, drawing particularly from their anti-climactic notions ofplateaus and afterglows. Theorizing post-places may be useful for scholars interestedin gayborhoods as a substantive topic area, butmay also be transferredmore generallyto any instance where emplaced materiality gives way to more virtual and imaginedforms of spatial affect, such as Hadrian’s Wall and other ruinous sites (e.g. Warnabyet al. 2010; Warnaby and Medway 2017).16.2 The Phenomenology of PlaceBefore developing my own Deleuzoguattarian lines of thinking, it is worthwhileoutlining the phenomenological precepts of the place concept in order to prefacethe post-phenomenological positions that follow. The phenomenological point ofdeparture is the importance of experience and the concomitant delineation betweenspace and place (Cresswell 2004, 2013). From a phenomenological perspectivespace denotes meaningless material arrangements, while place describes meaningfulmanipulations ofmateriality intomeaningful three-dimensional forms (Visconti et al.2010). Stated succinctly, place is “a meaningful location” (Cresswell 2004: 7). Suchphenomenological thinking has greatly influenced the study of gayborhoods andother LGBTQ+ sites, albeit often implicitly. Sexuality and gender become salientwhen space becomes place, as meaningless environments become meaningful loca-tions inflected by cultural connotations and sociosymbolic segregations. After yearsof research there persists a prevalent “notion that if space is not made gay or lesbian,then itmust be straight”, such that “straight space [...] becomes the underlying framewith which we work: the space that gays subvert and the place that lesbians cohabit”374 J. Coffin(Bell et al. 1994: 32). Even when theorizations treat space as asexual and gender-less, because it lacks humanity,3 they tend to be tacitly heteronormative in postu-lating that space is sexualized or gendered only by conspicuous material symbolsand symbolic practices of LGBTQ+ identity (Kates 2002; Rosenbaum2005;Visconti2008).Thanks to the phenomenological presuppositions, LGBTQ+ cultures have beeninformed by an underlying sociospatial dialectic of in/visibility, at least up untilthe turn of the millennium (Keating and McGloughlin 2005; Ghaziani 2015). Theapparent decline and disappearance of gayborhoods in the years hence is partlyexplicable by the shift towards more subtle signals of sexuality (Brown 2006;Ghaziani 2014). However, this shift to subtlety also reflects a post-binary moodwithin non-normative cultures (Ghaziani 2011; Hess 2019), which arguably chal-lenges the ocularcentric conceptualizations of conventional phenomenology and itsheteronormative distinction between invisible straight-space and visible LGBTQ+places. Instead of conflating phenomenology with observable markers of identity, itmay help to return to the origins of the term as a philosophy of experience (Thompsonet al. 1989). As the links between visible symbolism and felt subjectivity dissolve,a particular place is defined via subjective experience, rather than through symbol-ically communicative objects or actions. This encourages scholars to adopt a moresensitive approach to theorizing the dynamics between sexuality, gender, space, andplace. For instance, Ghaziani (2021) argues that urban scholars should listen moreclosely to LGBTQ+ people, whose street-level experiences may facilitate a morenuanced understanding of gayborhoods than the ‘supra-individual’ patterns providedby demographers. In a similar vein, the minutiae of everyday experience may helpto highlight how gayborhoods may become more than just physical places, as longas the phenomenology of experience is understood in a less conventional (but alsomore traditional) sense.16.3 Post-Phenomenological PerspectivesDespite the scholarly successes of phenomenological thinking, not all geographersor geographically-inclined academics presume phenomenological precepts. Manyadopt different philosophical positions to advance alternative accounts of sociospa-tial phenomena, such as neo-Marxism (Soja 1980; Lefebvre 1991; Harvey 2005)or Thrift’s (2008) Non-Representational Theory (NRT), emphasizing how spatialarrangements can influence social phenomena without needing to be consciously3Thus, this heteronormativity is also anthropocentric. Animals and plants have sexualized andgendered characteristics as well as territorial and spatial configurations. Is it such a stretch ofthe imagination to consider how these might also entwine? The vital materialism of Deleuze andGuattari, which builds on the earlier philosophical precedents of Spinoza and Nietzsche, positsthat desires and (re)productive tendencies are found in everything from rocks to rainwater. Suchphilosophical positions could afford explorations of unfamiliar topologies that anthropocentricassumptions presently preclude (see Coffin, 2021).16 Plateaus and Afterglows: Theorizing the Afterlives … 375recognized as places (Coffin and Chatzidakis 2021). Given that these alternativeapproaches de-centre the theoretical primacy of human experience, they can begrouped together under the heuristic heading of post-phenomenology, which retainsthe phenomenological interest in experience but jettisons the figure of “a fullyformed subjectivity ‘in control’”, meaning that “experience is not individualized into‘whole’ and coherent subjects, but rather presents a fractured sense of subjectivity”(Hietanen and Sihvonen 2020: 2). This term also encompasses the array of assem-blage approaches that abound across social theory. The appellation of assemblage hasmany sources in social theory (Marcus and Saka 2006), but as a theoretical tool it wasmost extensively developed by Deleuze and Guattari (1983, 1986, 1987), becominga way of conceptualizing “the world as constituted from more or less temporaryamalgamations of heterogeneous material and semiotic elements, amongst whichcapacities and actions emerge not as properties of individual elements, but throughthe relationships established between them” (Canniford and Bajde 2016: 1). Accord-ingly, an assemblage approach can be used to conceptualize geographies as multi-scalar arrangements of relational activities (Anderson and McFarlane 2011; McFar-lane and Anderson 2011; Allen 2011), or topologies (Cresswell 2013). As noted byCanniford et al. (2018: 235), “from an assemblage perspective, space is constructedfrom distributed entanglements […] in this view, spaces and the actions that occurthere can be seen to be constructed from a broader network of things than initialappearances might warrant”. Nash and Gorman-Murray (2017) proposed that theconcept of assemblage could enable scholars to account for the diverse and dynamicgeographies of contemporary LGBTQ+ cultures, but the application of this approachremains limited.The assemblage is not the only concept that Deleuze and Guattari developed. Asnoted by Roffe (2016: 42–43), “further resources exist in their account that may yetbe put to work”. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari worked together on a number oftexts including Anti-Oedipus, Kafka: Towards a Minor Literature, and A ThousandPlateaus. Much like Michel Foucault, their contemporary and Deleuze’s colleague,these authors are scholarly superstars who are often cited in passing by academicswho have not necessarily read the original texts but rather engaged with them at adistance via secondary sources. This is perhaps partly due to their discursive style,which is “at times formidably difficult” (Roffe 2016: 42), “owingmore to poetry thanprose” (Coffin 2019: 2). Their writings draw from a range of sources and address aplethora of topics, adopting a non-linear structure that seeks to put their ‘rhizomatic’philosophy into practice. Yet a consistent theme in their work is an attempt to explainreality in terms of open-ended and open-to-change ‘becomings’ that blur and blendbodies of various kinds into machinic systems (Coffin 2019; Hietanen et al. 2019).Deleuze and Guattari constructed a cadre of concepts to crystalize their complexand changeable ontological outlook. Although the assemblage4 is one of the more4It is worth noting here that the term assemblage is actually anAnglophone translation of the originalFrench term agencement, and that the appropriateness of this translation is contested (Phillips 2006;376 J. Coffinfamous of these concepts, the plateau represents another that may be productive forscholars interested in LGBTQ+ topologies.16.4 Plateaus and AfterglowsDespite its eponymous status, the notion of the plateau is not developed extensivelyas a concept within the pages of A Thousand Plateaus. Rather it operates more asa performative device. In the ‘Author’s Note’ at the start of the book, Deleuze andGuattari (1988) explain that all of the chapters are ‘plateaus’ that can be read inany order, except the conclusion which should be read last. Aside from this earlyexegesis, the plateau is only deployed a smattering of times within the remainingpages. However, Deleuze and Guattari are said to have supported imaginativeinterpretations of their work (Roffe 2016; Price and Epp 2016; Botez and Hietanen2017), espousing what I have previously described as a “critical-creative spirit”(Coffin 2019: 8).5 When introducing his Deleuzoguattarian-inspired ‘assemblagetheory’, Manuel DeLanda (2006: 3) noted that “the relatively few places dedicatedto assemblage theory in the work of Deleuze [and Guattari]… hardly amount to afully-fledged theory”. Instead, DeLanda (2006: 4) used his own conceptual creativityto draw these theoretical fragments together with resources from other sources,stating “readers who feel that the theory developed here is not strictly speakingDeleuze’s own are welcome to call it ‘neo-assemblage theory’, ‘assemblage theory2.0’, or some other name”. In a similar vein, I will draw inspiration from Deleuzeand Guattari but define the nebulous notion of the plateau in my own terms,reworking it and the attendant concept of the afterglow into rhetorical resources aptfor application to the study of erstwhile gayborhoods and other post-places.Deleuze and Guattari (1988: 21) describe how “a plateau is always in the middle,not at the beginning or the end”. In terms of geology, a walkermust ascend or descendalong some other plane in order to reach the flat surface of a particular plateau.Metaphorically, this means that the term can imply changes in speed and orien-tation, as well as embeddedness within wider geographical and historical features(Fig. 16.1). They add an anthropological association when they argue that “GregoryBateson uses the word ‘plateau’ to designate something very special: a continuous,self-vibrating region of intensitieswhose development avoids anyorientation towardsLaw 2009; Roffe 2016). Some, like Hietanen and Andéhn (2018: 552), prefer to use agencement asthis is more suggestive of “the intertwined nature of all forces in such emergent events, rather than‘assemblage’, which connotes a more technical notion designating an arrangement of objects”.5The ‘critical’ is crucial here: it means thinking critically in the sense of questioning conventionsand other taken-for-granted ways of thinking, feeling, acting, and becoming; however, it also meansthinking critically of Deleuzoguattarian interpretations, and not treating Deleuze and Guattari’slicence of creativity as a kind of hyper-relativism masquerading as pragmatism (i.e. ‘my interpreta-tion works within the context of this paper, so it cannot be criticised’). Buchanan (2015: 383) arguesthat Deleuze and Guattari wanted concepts to have “cutting edges”, so different interpretations ofDeleuzoguattarian thinking can (and should) be evaluated.16 Plateaus and Afterglows: Theorizing the Afterlives … 377Fig. 16.1 A geological plateau (Source Image by author)a culmination point or external end” (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988: 21–22). Unlikethe climax of a mountain peak or the nadir of the valley floor, a plateau is flat in alldirections and does not culminate in anything except more of the same, unless onechanges orientation and leaves the plateau via one of many sloped vectors. Refer-encing Bateson’s work with Balinese sexual culture, Deleuze and Guattari associateplateaus with intense experiences that do not result in orgasmic release but ratherongoing sensations. This contrasts sharply with the Western model of sexuality, aswell as the Western model of thought and action generally. “It is a regrettable char-acteristic of the Western mind”, Deleuze and Guattari (1988: 22) write, “to relateexpressions and actions to exterior or transcendent ends, instead of evaluating themon a plane of consistency on the basis of their intrinsic value”. In the broadest sense,then, plateaus refer to phenomena that have their own logics or arrangements, but arealso embeddedor interconnected intowider topologies, and thus affect the trajectoriesof those who pass across their planes.The concept of the plateau can be applied to study places in ways that appreciateidentity and relationality while avoiding linearity and teleology. The rise and declineof gayborhoods can be thought of as a linear narrative (Coffin et al. 2016), andone that emphasizes the goal-driven or ‘teleological’ activities of conscious place-makers. In contrast, Deleuzoguattarian thinking is open to the non-linear messinessof unexpected ruptures and connections by non-conscious forces that do not have anyparticular objective or orientation (Hietanen et al. 2019). It is post-phenomenologicalin the sense that it treats the experience of place as an ephemeral ‘becoming’ thatemerges from the machinic entanglements of heterogeneous entities (Coffin 2019).378 J. CoffinSuch becomings may be ephemeral, but their effects can be carried to other timesand places in alternative forms, as when the direct experience of a place becomes amemory then applied to products and services (Brunk et al. 2018;Andéhn et al. 2019).Deleuze andGuattari (1988: 22) put thismore poetically, writing that “lines leave oneplateau and proceed to another like columns of tiny ants”. Thus, the place-as-plateauconcept emphasizes the entanglement of geographical phenomena in ways that maynot be foregrounded as prominently by the place-as-meaningful-location conceptu-alization (c.f. Cresswell 2004). Relationality is something that is often overlooked orleft implicit in studies of spatiality (Coffin et al. 2016), except in cases where placesare explicitly defined as ‘other’ (Foucault 1986; Chatzidakis et al. 2012; Roux et al.2018), or when relationships to place are presented as proxies to interpersonal rela-tionships (Debendetti et al. 2014; Rosenbaum et al. 2017). Drawing inspiration fromDeleuze and Guattari, relational ontologies have become increasingly popular ingeography (Massey 2005; Murdoch 2006) and marketing (Giovanardi and Lucarelli2018; Canniford et al. 2018), representing a response to this theoretical tendencyto elide sociospatial interconnectivity in favour of more isolated conceptualizations(Cresswell 2013). Plateaus build on this precedent.The related notion of the afterglow does not come directly from Deleuze andGuattari but rather via Brian Massumi, a philosopher who also served as the Englishlanguage translator of A Thousand Plateaus. In his translator’s foreword Massumi(1987, p.xiv) writes that “in Deleuze and Guattari, a plateau is reached when circum-stances combine to bring an activity to a pitch of intensity that is not automaticallydissipated in a climax”. This description accords with the arguments made in theprevious two paragraphs, but Massumi (1987, p.xiv) adds that “the heightening ofenergies is sustained long enough to leave an afterimage of its dynamism that can bereactivated or injected into other activities”. This is akin to the optical illusions thatcan be created by looking at a white surface after staring at certain brightly colouredimages for several seconds (Fig. 16.2). Although this idea of an afterimage is onlybriefly mentioned, I feel it has much merit in helping to understand gayborhoods aspost-places. It means that the relational effects of a place-plateau may linger, even ifthe physical location disappears, as long as the experience of that place is sufficientlyintense to leave enduring marks, or ‘afterimages’. In turn, these afterimages allowa place to ‘live on’ as a post-place, moving from the visible marks considered byconventional phenomenological thought to the less visible, but indelible and influ-ential, marks recognized by post-phenomenological thinking. As detailed below, theterm ‘afterimage’ may be used to describe consciously recalled memories, but alsopreconscious habits, unconscious associations, and non-conscious environmentalprocesses. Given that many of these phenomena are non-visual, I propose that theterm afterglow as an alternative to the ocularcentric ‘afterimage’. Some glowsmay bevisually apprehended but others keenly felt, and the term afterglow has associationsapposite for scholars of sexuality and gender. Regardless of terminology, the crucialconsequence of the afterimage or afterglow is identical—both terms refer to affec-tive intensities whose energies are redirected into other forms and flows rather thanreleased in a climatic cessation. It is this fading-out and fading-into that engendersthe notion of a post-place, to which I presently turn.16 Plateaus and Afterglows: Theorizing the Afterlives … 379Fig. 16.2 An example of a high contrast image that can create optical afterglows (Source Imageby author)16.5 Post-Placing GayborhoodsFrom a phenomenological perspective a gayborhood is an area of urban space thatbecomes meaningfully differentiated as an LGBTQ+ place, with perceptions andpractices (re)producing geographical arrangements within its perimeter that do notnecessarily pertain elsewhere, at least not with as much potency. A gayborhood isborn as it becomes distinctively LGBTQ+ and declines or ‘dies’ as its physical orimagined differences dissolve. However, from a post-phenomenological perspectivea gayborhood can have an afterlife even if its physical presence is lost. This is becausegayborhoods, likemostmeaningful places, produce intense affective experiences thatleave their marks in the minds and bodies of humans, as well as in the heterogeneousbodies that constitute the non-human environment. Deleuze and Guattari (1987: 80)stress that “we may take the word ‘body’ in its broadest sense”. Bodies of water,political bodies, and bodies of knowledge all count in this broader definition ofembodiment, as do the bodies of city streets and urban squares. If a plateau becomessufficiently intense, as a physical place that can be experienced first-hand, then itcan leave an afterglow that continues to exert an effect through the bodies of thosethat experienced this intensity. The plateau describes a place as a physical-sensualenvironment within a particular territory, while the afterglow denotes a post-place asan imaginary-symbolic effect that percolates through deterritorialized networks.How might afterglows continue to affect bodies and perpetuate the afterlife ofa post-place? At a conscious level, people may compare contemporary sites withinan LGBTQ+ diaspora to their memories of the erstwhile gayborhood. Stone (2021)380 J. Coffinshows that events like the Spanish Town Parade can link LGBTQ+ people ‘vicar-iously’ to a sense of place and community, even one that no longer exists in aspatially concentrated form. In terms of plateaus and afterglows, this vicariousnessmay be analysed as a form of afterglow that percolates through parades and otherevents, indirectly linking a (post-) place to a wider diaspora. Even if a physicalgayborhood persists, it may be influential more as an afterglow than as a physicalplace, and this afterglow may take on a greater importance in the urban fabric asthe gayborhood evolves or dissolves. Interestingly, Stone’s account of the SpanishTown Parade highlights how heterosexual and even homophobic influences havebegun to corrupt the contemporary manifestations of this non-normative event,thus suggesting that positively charged afterglows from the past may be dilutedor distorted by competing influences in the present. Similarly, the identity of a placeitself may become palimpsestic as the afterglows of previous incarnations competewith present-day interpretations and attempted re-appropriations in the near future.This topological layering of competing influences is vividly demonstrated in the caseof Philadelphia (Niedt 2021), while the contribution by Podmore (2021) suggests thatLGBTQ+ places across a conurbation are defined by dynamic dis/identificationswitha contested centrally located gayborhood.A comparative analysis of gayborhoods with different historical and geographicaltrajectories, such as that conducted by Gorman-Murray and Nash (2020), suggeststhat while such places provide opportunities for community, belonging, and identity,they also constrain the emergence of other possible topologies. Thus, the declineof a gayborhood may actually be liberating for those subjectivities that have beenlargely occluded by the homonormative gayborhoods of the past (Frisch 2021), byrebalancing the centripetal and centrifugal forces within a particular milieu (Doanand Atalay 2021). If afterglows persist, then the limiting effects of gayborhoodsmay diminish without losing all of the positive effects that they used to provide.If so, it is also important for scholars to analyse instances where the afterglows ofpost-places fail to carry effects that were once engendered in the erstwhile physicalplace. Wienke et al. (2020) demonstrate how districts with a higher concentration ofsame-sex couples (i.e. gayborhoods) can reduce rates of depression and increase self-esteem. It is unlikely that such mental health benefits can be recreated by afterglowsalone. Some, such as memories, may even make people feel worse, suggesting thatafterglows may even reverse or invert the powers of a particular physical place.Then again, afterglows like habits may be able to carry across some of the positiveaffect from a place into a post-placed diaspora. Such speculations are best put to theempirical test.Plateaus and afterglows add to a discursive repertoire which already aboundswith metaphoric attempts to capture the ambulance, ambiguity, and ambivalenceof contemporary LGBTQ+ topologies. The notion of a diaspora, so eloquentlyemployed by Bitterman (2020), makes little sense without a ‘home’ or central placefrom which a culture has dispersed. Analogously, the globally diffuse Jewish popu-lation would not be described as a diaspora without the notion of a physical placefrom which the Jewish culture emerged. The Jewish analogy also highlights how16 Plateaus and Afterglows: Theorizing the Afterlives … 381the idea of a homeland is not simply an academic reference point to define a dias-pora but also an affectively-charged afterglow that lingers in the hearts and minds ofdeterritorialized cultures, even after many centuries. Such afterglows can also inspireaction at the individual and collective level, as illustrated by the social movement tore-establish the Jewish homeland in the state of Israel. In the case of LGBTQ+ dias-poras, empirical research suggests that opinions may vary about whether the declineof gayborhoods should be lamented, celebrated, or some mixture of the two (Coffinet al. 2016; Ghaziani 2014), yet the identity of these diasporas are all affected by theafterimage of their lost local gayborhood. Subjects socialized into topologies that didnot develop a clearly demarcated gayborhood—for example those in Italy (Visconti2008) and Taiwan (Hsieh and Wu 2011)—may not ascribe to a diasporic logic.In contrast to the diaspora, Doan (2019: 5) provides a planetary metaphor, writingof gayborhoods as “mini suns around which LGBTQ individuals orbit, some closer,some further away”. What happens when the physical place disappears, no longerexerting its influence on individuals?One possibility is that gayborhoodswhich “burntoo brightly may run out of fuel”, eventually exploding and then becoming ‘blackholes’ (Doan 2019: 5). This might be one way of interpreting Manchester’s GayVillage, as a slow-motion supernova manifest in bankrupt LGBTQ+ businesses anda black hole of boarded-up premises (Fig. 16.3). The slow diffusion designated byplateaus provides an alternative account to such climatic and cataclysmic concep-tualizations, with gayborhood enterprises becoming untenable only because manyFig. 16.3 Closed premises in Manchester’s Gay Village (Source Image by author)382 J. Coffinother spaces become ‘friendly’ (Rosenbaum 2005) or ‘post-gay’ (Brown 2006). Inthe case of Manchester it appears that the city center ‘gayborhood’ is less of a blackhole and more of a white dwarf, diminishing physically but not quite losing its influ-ence. Ghaziani (2014) has written about the physicality of disappearing gayborhoodsremaining as historicalmarkers, but the nuanceddynamics of howgayborhoods lingeras afterglows could benefit from further analysis and theorization.The plateau comes closest to the analogy of archipelagos proposed by Ghaziani(2019), especially asDeleuzoguattarian thinking redirects scholarly attention to influ-ences “beneath the surface of salience” (Coffin2019: 2), and thus considers thefigura-tive landmass connecting islands beneath the waters. Put less figuratively, afterglowscan also analyse and account for unconscious influences. A consciously perceivedimage in the individual mind or collective imagination may inspire action, but so toocan an indelible and inarticulable mark left by an affective intensity. In marketingtheory there has been a (re)turn to the psychoanalytic argument that some, if notmost,of human subjectivity is unconsciously determined (Cluley and Desmond 2015).Such an appreciation might also be applied to afterglows, which may subtly shapesociospatial responses in ways that are difficult to pinpoint. Inmy own researchmanyparticipants described Manchester’s Gay Village as an undesirable place in terms ofatmosphere and service, yet they still felt a desire to visit and patronize this district forreasons that they could not articulate. This may necessitate a more psychoanalytic, orpost-phenomenological, approach to analysis (Cluley and Desmond 2015; Hietanenand Sihvonen 2020). Posthuman sensibilities may also be advantageous, insofar asafterglows may also leave their marks in unconscious arrangements of non-humans.Geo-tagging photographs, writing customer reviews, or searching for a location onsmartphone maps are all lingering records, even when physical places are lost. Thesemay shape the results of internet searches and contribute to the ongoing performa-tivity of marketing systems (Cluley and Brown 2015), which are increasingly auto-mated in the post-marketing project of hyper-relevance (Darmody and Zwick 2020).These electronic afterglows may also affect the physical landscape by influencingurban planning, especially given that the prevailing penchant for ‘smart cities’ insiststhat all decisions should be based on big data rather than creative design (Fleming2020). Here organic afterglows, such as the malleable memories of a place, mayactually reduce resistance to capitalist logics of accumulation (Brunk et al. 2018),thus augmenting the electronic afterglows of data-driven urban development. Asshown by Miles (2021), Grindr and other technologies create hybrid sociospatialarrangements that disrupt traditional, ‘low-tech’, theorizations of sexuality, gender,space, and place. Future research will need to carefully consider the complex config-urations of human and non-human afterglows, and quickly; in Manchester’s GayVillage developments are already well underway (Fig. 16.4), and well on their wayto erasing the gayborhood without much local resistance.On the topic of future research, there are plenty of theoretical, practical, andpolitical questions that invite further exploration. How affectively intense does agayborhood (or other place) need to be in order to generate an afterglowing post-place?Do all places leave an afterglow, or is it only those that reach a certain thresholdof affective intensity? If the latter, is there a typical threshold that affect needs to16 Plateaus and Afterglows: Theorizing the Afterlives … 383Fig. 16.4 A new development in Manchester’s Gay Village (Source Image by author)reach or does this vary greatly between contexts? Deleuze and Guattari (1987) writeof singularities as events that lead to a qualitative change in an assemblage, a kindof ‘tipping point’ that is distinct from other changes. A simple example is that ofheating water, with each incremental increase having little effect except that whichtips over a ‘boiling point’ and transforms liquid water into steam (DeLanda and384 J. CoffinHarman 2017). In terms of places, it may be that only those that ‘boil over’ intospectacular experiences, powerful protests, or some other atypical threshold mayleave afterglows. The Stonewall Inn Riots represent a case-in-point: the riots werea cultural watershed that set in motion many affects and actions, and the place isnow a site of pilgrimage for many LGBTQ+ people (see Ghaziani 2015). It is likelythat the Stonewall will remain as a post-place even if the physical site is closeddown, but other raided bars, which “failed to achieve the mythic status of Stonewall”(Armstrong and Crage 2006: 725), may not leave a lingering afterglow of affect.Practical questions for non-academic stakeholders also abound. Should townplan-ners, place marketers, and policy-makers attempt to anticipate post-places whendesigning places? Should they seek to nurture afterglows as valuable urban assetswhen gayborhoods and other once-significant spaces are displaced by gentrifica-tion? Or, are afterglows dangerous sources of attachment and resistance that shouldbe avoided by those who wish capitalist accumulation and alteration to advanceunabated? Place marketing studies of historical sites certainly suggest that after-glows can be valuable (Warnaby et al. 2010), but in vibrant places like cities after-glows may act as undesirable attachments that place branding consultants needto expunge (Warnaby and Medway 2013). Here one can observe how practicalquestions should provoke political considerations also. Who gets to decide whichplaces should become post-places? Who benefits from afterglows and who losesout? Might afterglows become a post-rationalization for allowing important placesto decline, presented as a salve for sociospatial refugees? For instance, selling cities ascosmopolitan and accepting may suggest that certain groups, such as trans* people,no longer need gayborhoods as safe spaces, especially in an era of digitalization.However, such narratives elide the enduring inequalities of access and assimilation(Coffin et al. 2016), and may be promoted by powerful actors intent on replacingLGBTQ+ community spaces with more profitable real estate. More often than not,the political, practical, and theoretical effects of afterglows will form ambiguousadmixtures that are difficult to disentangle.16.6 Conclusion: Beyond the Gayborhood in Space, Time,and Scholarship?The notion of places as plateaus that leave post-phenomenological afterglows is onethat extends the influence of a particular place beyond its geographical boundaries toa cultural diaspora that exists across wider urban, suburban, and rural geographies.This chapter applied such ideas to the case of gayborhoods, but they might also beappropriate when analysing a range of other (post-) places. These notions extend thepower of place across space but also time, beyond the ostensible ‘death’ of a placeas a physical site that can be visited and experienced in the phenomenological first-hand. While phenomenology focuses on the physical and representational aspects ofplaces-as-environments, the post-phenomenological approach developed here maybe applied also to places that are physically diminished, such as ruins (e.g. Warnabyet al. 2010;Warnaby andMedway 2017), or those that are replaced by less distinctive16 Plateaus and Afterglows: Theorizing the Afterlives … 385Fig. 16.5 A photograph from the Manchaster Pride Parade (Source Image by author)forms, such as the Powerscourt shoppingmall inDublin (Maclaran andBrown 2005).Such places live on in their afterglow, as memories, digital traces, and the collectiveimagination of culture. As plateaus and afterglows represent conceptual tools thatcan be transferred to other research areas, it might be argued that the emergenceand evolution of LGBTQ+ topologies should not be considered a discrete topic of386 J. Coffininterest for a niche group of scholars. Instead, wemight be more ambitious and arguethat gayborhoods are actually acute cases of broader processes that can be of generalinterest to geographers, sociologists, consumer researchers, and others. The livesand afterlives of gayborhoods are not simply stories of sexual and gender minorities,but a narrative structure that speaks to aspects of the universal human condition likeacceptance, community, identity, change, and love (Fig. 16.5).6ReferencesAllen J (2011) Powerful assemblage.

Some of these shifts havecalled into question the role of physical places for face-to-face gatherings, includingthose used by LGBTQ+ people. Such open questions are a key concern for a book ongayborhoods, so this chapter engages in three analytic tasks to provide preliminaryreflections on how pandemics problematize places. While acknowledging a range ofthreats and challenges that the pandemic poses to the future of LGBTQ+ spaces, thischapter focuses on the potential opportunities and unexpected benefits that COVID-19 can create, running counter to more pessimistic predictions that abound in populardiscourse. First, the chapter contextualizes how the COVID-19 pandemic is remi-niscent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, allowing the gayborhood to be well-equippedto respond with grassroots activism, particularly in the face of government inactionor apathy. Second, the chapter explores trends that can ensure the future vitality ofLGBTQ+ spaces, including (i) the potential of mutual aid networks, (ii) the power ofinstitutional anchors in LGBTQ+ placemaking efforts, (iii) urban changes related tohomesteading and population shifts, (iv) innovations in the interior design of phys-ical spaces, and (v) opportunities to enhance social connections through augmentedvirtual engagements.

Third, the cognitive schemas of lockdowns, re-closeting, and digitalscapesare identified as unique expressions of the shifting spatialities of sexuality in post-pandemic urban space. The chapter concludes by arguing that place will still matterfor LGBTQ+ people in a post-COVID-19 era, albeit with alteredmeanings andmate-rial expressions. The socio-spatial consequences of the novel coronavirus will be aconfluence of positive and negative developments, and while some will be reversedas soon as an effective vaccine is found, others will linger indelibly in bodies and thebuilt environment for years to come.Keywords AIDS · Coronavirus · COVID-19 · Gayborhoods · Gayneighborhoods · HIV · LGBTQ+ · Pandemic · Public health17.1 Introduction: Once More, Without Human Contact?In the midst of the coronavirus epidemic, we are all bombarded… by calls not to touch othersbut to isolate ourselves, to maintain a proper corporeal distance. (Žižek 2020: 1)During a global pandemic where people are implored to remain spatially distanced,are physical places of co-presence still viable for LGBTQ+ communities? Are theyimportant in an era of virtual meetings and online dates? How has the significanceof gay neighborhoods changed with the novel coronavirus as a backdrop? These arevital questions for an edited volume that has sought to demonstrate that “gayhor-hoods matter.” Several chapters have looked at LGBTQ+ districts in the past andthe present, as well as speculating about their possible futures, yet they were writtenbefore COVID-19 spread across the globe and transformed our social, economic,and geographical realities in ways hitherto unfathomable. A critical reader mightconclude that some of the preceding chapters require a reorientation to accommo-date post-COVID-19 realities. In this epilogue, five contributors convene to articulatea vision that acknowledges the need to reconceptualize gayborhoods. Ultimately, weargue that places will still matter in the post-pandemic urban landscape. Far fromsignaling the death knell of LGBTQ+ spaces and places, the collective experiencewith COVID-19 demonstrates the enduring appeal provided by urban areas of phys-ical proximity (see Fig. 17.1). Quarantine measures and the “new normal” of techno-logically mediated meetings have threatened the economic viability of gayborhoods,but absence, especially an enforced one, makes the heart grow fonder—and thus asecond wave of place attachments and localized activism present a viable future aswell (see Fig. 17.2).While this chapter can only speculate about the post-pandemic realities ofLGBTQ+ people and places, we predict that the socio-spatial consequences of thecoronavirus will be a confluence of positive and negative developments. While someof these will be reversed as soon as an effective vaccine is found, others will lingerin our bodies and in the built environment (see Fig. 17.3). For instance, the call tomaintain physical distance is not so different from the injunction on intimate contact17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 395Fig. 17.1 Greenwich Village is one of the key centers of LGBTQ+ life in New York City (SourceImage by Anne Hanavan)396 S. Miles et al.Fig. 17.2 Pavement tables permit spatial distancing for customers at the famed Stonewall Inn inGreenwich Village in New York City (Source Image by Anne Hanavan)imposed by the arrival of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s. For many LGBTQ+ people, thecurrent situation is reminiscent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic; even those too youngto have experienced it first hand still grew up in its cultural shadows (Bitterman2020b). This prior experience is productive—the gayborhood is uniquely equippedto respondwith grassroots activism, particularly in the face of government inaction orapathy—but it is also potentially problematic, as it may trigger negative memories oftrauma, encourage individualistic withdrawal from human contact, or provide histor-ical models that delimit reimagining what LGBTQ+ geographies could become. Onthis last point, while there are certainly parallels between the two pandemics, thereare also significant differences. Digital technology, for example, may encourageLGBTQ+ communities to diffuse, rather than to gather together in gayborhoods asthey did during the HIV/AIDS pandemic (Coffin 2021; Miles 2021).The remainder of this chapter proceeds as follows. First, we articulate the analyticparameters of the current pandemic. In this discussion, we define COVID-19 as a“glocal” phenomenon, one with transnational as well as local expressions and impli-cations. This property of the pandemic is important to understand before we canconsider how it might affect the meanings of the gayborhood and other types ofLGBTQ+ spaces. Next, we review a range of empirical transformations and trends.We seek to maintain a balanced tone in our discussion, considering the threats andchallenges that COVID-19 poses alongside opportunities and unexpected benefits17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 397Fig. 17.3 Residents and visitors in gayborhoods everywhere (in Chicago) follow COVID-19regulations including wearing masks and practicing spatial distancing (Source Image by WilliamIvancic)398 S. Miles et al.for the future of LGBTQ+ urban spaces. Based on this discussion, we propose thatacademics, activists, and other stakeholders should reconsider the guiding metaphorof “the gayborhood” and instead conceptualize LGBTQ+ geographies in moreinnovative and expansive ways.17.2 Do Places Matter? Empirical Trends for the Futureof LGBTQ+ SpacesIt is limiting to viewCOVID-19 as a uniformly destructive force for gayborhoods andother types of LGBTQ+ spaces. In this section, we highlight the unexpected opportu-nities that a pandemic can generate for urban sexual communities. Five trends strikeus as promising, even in moments of widespread uncertainty, for ensuring the vitalityof LGBTQ+ spaces: (1) the power of mutual aid networks, (2) the power of institu-tional anchors in placemaking efforts, (3) urban change related to homesteading andpopulation shifts, (4) innovations in the architecture and interior design of physicalspaces, and (5) opportunities to enhance social connection through augmented virtualengagements. Together, these themes can refocus conversations about the effects ofpandemics away from assumptions of demise and community dilution to emergentempirical realities of reconstitution and community resilience (see Fig. 17.4).(1) LGBTQ+ individuals and organizations can participate in “mutual aidnetworks” to respond to the current public health crisis, particularly by drawingon community-specific knowledge and experience related to the HIV/ AIDSpandemic.The HIV/AIDS pandemic strengthened LGBTQ+ spaces by creating a consol-idated urban network which activists used to tackle the ravages of the disease.Similarly, queer communities may once again self-organize by using gaybor-hoods as a base to disseminate information or distribute face masks and otherPersonal ProtectiveEquipment (PPE).LGBTQ+communities andorganizationsleveraged their collective expertise and resources to respond to the HIV/AIDSpandemic by reducing stigma, encouraging widespread testing, and negotiatingbetter access to treatment (Ghaziani 2008).Despite thiswell-documented histor-ical example, present-day governments and policy makers have generally over-looked the potential benefits such as grassroots collective activitieswhen consid-ering their responses to COVID-19. For instance, the UK government chose tobuild centralized laboratories to process tests and rejected an offer to createa complementary network of smaller local providers (BBC 2020a).1,2 Thereremain opportunities for authority figures to work with grassroots organizers,1Sir Paul Nurse, the chief executive of the Francis Crick research institute, described the proposedapproach using the analogy of the Dunkirk evacuation in World War.2The government has put some big boats, destroyers in place. That’s a bit more cumbersome to getworking and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well.17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 399Fig. 17.4 Community organization and non-profit services adapted to meet COVID-19-relatedregulations, including the DC Center for LGBT Community in Washington, DC (Source Image byElizabeth R. June)400 S. Miles et al.not least because the latter can generate a sense of ownership of health outcomesby (and for) local populations (Marston et al. 2020).The potential for action by mutual aid networks within communities, aidedby mobile digital technologies, peer-to-peer communication, and a healthydose of campaigning and activism—all independent of centralized or formal-ized networks—is already evident in the response to COVID-19 (Butler 2020;Villadiego 2020). The businesses and residents in gayborhoods could buildsimilar movements, attracting external supporters (e.g., visitors and govern-ments) to create a grassroots response to COVID-19 with their gayboorhoodat the center. In an acceptance speech in June 2019 for the Isabelle StevensonTony Award for her outstanding service to the LGBTQ+ community, the Amer-ican actress Judith Light explained that gay men, lesbians, and their allieshave a great deal of knowledge about the AIDS pandemic, which they canpass along to other groups and future generations (Bitterman and Hess 2021).She characterized LGBTQ+ people as a “community of leadership.” It is ourhope that by engaging in their leadership capacity and working together co-operatively—through gayborhood meetings to plan community events, throughguerrilla or grassroots advertising campaigns for gay community venues, orthrough exchanging skills and sharing resources—LGBTQ+ communities cancapitalize on the strength of their local spaces and sense of communal wellbeing.(2) New types of LGBTQ+ institutional anchors may develop within and outsidegayborhoods in response to the pandemic, fostering novel commercial outletsand community spaces.A second unexpected opportunity is that COVID-19 may augment the roleof “institutional anchors” (Ghaziani 2014a), distinctive facilities that providesalient markers of urban sexualities (Ghaziani 2021). Consider the recent caseof the Little Gay Shop in East Austin, Texas. As recent transplants from NewYork City, owners Justin Galicz and Kirt Reynolds wanted to open a queercommunity space that was not centered on alcohol and partying.When you enterthis little shipping container on Airport Boulevard, you will find all manner ofqueer paraphernalia, including t-shirts, pins, patches, books, and magazines.This can be considered an institutional anchor because it provides a place thatallows local residents, tourists, and other actors to engage with queer culture,reproducing it through their experiences and enactments.Galicz and Reynolds encounteredmedia reports which suggested that LGBTQ+bars, from Austin to New York City, have closed at greater rates as cases ofCOVID-19 surged. Music festivals, like South by Southwest in Austin, havealso been canceled. In light of these challenges posed by the pandemic, theduo realized that a community space like theirs is more important than ever.“They [artists] are people that either freelance or they rely solely on pop-upsand markets and fairs and all of these different types of events to make theirliving,” Galicz remarked in an interview with The Austin Chronicle. “With allof those being canceled or postponed, we felt a responsibility to help them inanywaywaywe can.” The owners routinely share their proceedswith local queer17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 401artistic and political charities.3 By extending research on the enduring effectsof anchor institutions in the context of assimilation, we argue that new anchorsare forming which can provide financial support, cultural offerings, and socialopportunities in a pandemic. Unlike other kinds of businesses or organizations,institutional anchors are totems of communal life that represent distinct ways oflife. These places, like the Little Gay Shop, can survive even while some barsshutter.(3) In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, LGBTQ+ groups may migrate fromgayborhoods to other mobilities and settlement patterns.A number of media headlines, such as “Coronavirus may prompt migration outof American cities” and “Americans flee cities for the suburbs,” suggest that thepandemic has induced a major demographic shift.4 But is this shift temporary,or will it have longer lasting effects? In the US, this outbound migration is mostpronounced in New York City, where an estimated 5% of the population leftthe city for a period of time (see Fig. 17.5).5 Some headed to vacation homes,while others sought solace with extended family in the suburbs.6,7 The callto shelter in place and a nearly universal mandate to work from home haveled some to “predict doom for America’s biggest cities,” while others fear “anurban ice age.”8 Even larger migrations have been seen elsewhere in the world,often with more dramatic and disastrous effects. For example, in India the lossof income caused by lockdown forced millions of migrant workers to returnto their villages; with transport systems overwhelmed, this reverse migrationinvolved people walking hundreds of miles, with some dying from exhaustionor due to accidents on the road (BBC 2020b). Many countries have attemptedto mitigate the socioeconomic effects of these mass movements. In the UK,the government is trying to encourage workers to return to the office (BBC2020c), effectively attempting to “thaw” the urban economy of restaurants andother services catering to these workers and their clients. However, Florida(2020) predicts that the pandemic will accelerate an attraction to the suburbsfor families, while pushing young people and businesses into more peripheral,and thus affordable, urban areas.9 See Fig. 17.6.3https://www.statesman.com/entertainmentlife/20200720/little-gay-shop-opens-in-east-austin-with-art-books-and-big-dreams; https://www.austinchronicle.com/columns/2020-07-31/qmmunity-the-best-little-gay-shop-in-austin/.4https://fortune.com/2020/07/17/people-leaving-cities-coronavirus-data-population-millennials-marriage-families-housing-real-estate-suburbs/.5https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/16/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-moving-leaving.html.6https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/pandemic-cities-moving-remote-work/613069/.7https://www.zillow.com/research/2020-urb-suburb-market-report-27712/.8https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/pandemic-cities-moving-remote-work/613069/.9https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-07-02/how-coronavirus-will-reshape-u-s-cities.402 S. Miles et al.Fig. 17.5 Restaurants and bars in gay neighborhoods closed temporarily and adapted to COVID-19safety precautions (Source Image by Anne Hanavan)17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 403Fig. 17.6 LGBTQ+ neighborhoods serve an important function in mid-sized cities, such as theAllentown neighborhood in Buffalo, New York (Source Image by Alex Bitterman)Although some manifestations of this outward migration are contoured bywealth, like vacation homes, sexuality seems to be a more prominent deter-minant than class here. These fears are reminiscent of critiques of gayborhoodstudies for their metronormative emphasis (Halberstam 2005). Not all LGBTQ+people live in cities, and their collective engagement is not exclusively urban.Indeed, scholars have documented diverse spatial expressions and placemakingefforts in peri-urban (Forsyth 1997), suburban (Brekhus 2003; Tongson 2011),and rural environments (Bell and Valentine 1995; Gray 2009), along with ordi-nary cities (Robinson 2006; G Brown 2008) those in the Global South (Brownet al. 2010).All of these sites are captured by the imagery of cultural archipelagos(Ghaziani 2019a).Overlaying pandemic-related population shifts onto scholarly critiques of thegayborhood reveals the power of an expansive analytic gaze that reaches beyondcity-center locations. In short: we must shift our focus from urban settlementsto wider mobilities (Nash and Gorman-Murray 2014; Hess 2019; Bitterman2020a). As an example, Bain and Podmore (2020) use Surrey and New West-minster, peripheral metropolitan locations outside the Vancouver urban core,to show how placemaking is a function of resource landscapes (e.g., commer-cial infrastructure and gathering spaces that residents can use to organize socialactivities), political opportunity structures (e.g., institutional, policy, planning,404 S. Miles et al.and funding frameworks), and inter-organizational relations (e.g., informational,financial, and interpersonal networks). Settlements in places like Surrey andNew Westminster may be characterized by less territoriality than downtownVancouver, and they may lack the critical mass to support the type of insti-tutional density that characterizes the gayborhood, but queer visibility is stillundeniable. One respondent assertedwith optimism: “that’swhat’s unique aboutNewWestminster. We don’t have a village. The whole community is our inclu-sive village” (Bain and Podmore 2020: 11). In Surrey, NY, which has fewerresources and less political support for LGBTQ+ people, “a fragmented andsporadic solidarity” has emerged among its comparatively smaller group ofLGBTQ+ residents. In common, the two locales show the importance of usingmore imaginative measurement protocols to assess placemaking efforts beyondthe downtown core of major cities.(4) Pandemics can induce innovations in the configuration and design of interiorspaces, which can revive the importance of LGBTQ+ spaces, especially bars,without compromising public health protocols and safety procedures.For more than a decade—long before COVID-19 appeared—gays bars havebeen closing. As many as 37% of gay bars in the US shuttered from 2007 to2019 (Mattson 2019). Between 2006 and 2016, 58% of LGBTQ+ bars, pubs,and nightclubs in London shut down as well (Campkin and Marshall 2017;Ghaziani 2019b). These multi-national findings require us to separate questionsabout the sustainability of gay bars in general from the specific effects posedby a pandemic. For example, researchers have shown that there were more gaybars operating during the height of the AIDS pandemic than there are today,even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the temporary closures thatCOVID-19has induced can (and in some instances alreadyhave) becomeperma-nent failures, there are still more than 800 gay bars open across 46 US states.10The wisdom here is to focus on an ethos of survival and adaptability—but thequestion is how to do it.During the early months of the pandemic, states and municipalities across theUS implemented measures to enforce “social” or “physical distancing,” a publichealth initiative that has proven to reduce the rate of transmission for respiratoryviruses (Lipton and Steinhauer 2020; see Figs. 17.7 and 17.8). By mid-March2020,more than half ofUS states issued closure orders for their bars.As the virusspread, some countries, like Spain, Iran, Argentina, Brazil, India, Germany, andItaly placed their citizens on lockdown, a requirement which forced people to“stay home” or “shelter in place.” These measures created a crisis for LGBTQ+communities. Would the novel coronavirus “permanently damage or reshape”urban sexual cultures?11 “LGBTQ venues are our own churches. It’s where weform and nurture our community and the individuals within that,” said JohnSizzle, a Drag DJ who co-owns The Glory, a queer bar in East London. “Our10https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/05/gay-bars-struggling-reopen-coronavirus.html.11https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/06/how-quarantine-reshaping-queer-nightlife/612865/.17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 405Fig. 17.7 Gay bars, like this one in the Church Street neighborhood of Toronto, added pavementmarkings requiring patrons to practice spatial distancing in compliance with COVID-19-relatedregulations (Source Image by Rob Modzelewski)406 S. Miles et al.Fig. 17.8 Retail and commercial outlets in the Church Street neighborhood in Toronto remindcustomers to follow safety measures for the COVID-19 pandemic (Source Image by RobModzelewski)long-term future is not clear at all.” With voluntary and enforced lockdownsheltering measures in place, many LGBTQ+ establishments were operatingat significantly reduced capacity. This threatened the ability of owners to paytheir rent, utilities, and payroll. “We’ll die!” exclaimed Joaquin Pena, owner ofMadrid gay bar Marta Carino.12 What does the case of Covid-19 teach us aboutthe mechanisms of LGBTQ+ creative resilience?Interior design is a key theme that has enabled bar owners to survive plagues andpandemic.Andersson (2009) shows howgay bars in London’s Soho gayborhoodexpressed an aesthetic that was designed to counter their stigma as “contami-nated” by virtue of their association with AIDS. The result was a very particularlook: clean chromed surfaces, “clean” and “hygienic” white walls, minimalistfurniture, and youthful “pretty boy” bartenders who projected an image of goodhealth. This aesthetic, which was “profoundly shaped by AIDS” (Andersson2019: 2994), diffused to gay bars around the world. The style might read todayas “homonormative,” to borrow Andersson’s critique. By tracing its historicalorigins, however, we can appreciate how then, like today, gay bar owners haveused synergies between architecture, interior design, and urban space (Campkin12https://nationalpost.com/pmn/entertainment-pmn/well-die-gay-bars-risk-coronavirus-collapse.17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 4072007) as a mechanism of creative resilience and adaptive community buildingin a pandemic.The Pumpjack in Vancouver provides a contemporary example. As lockdownrestrictions eased in British Columbia, some LGBTQ+ establishments consid-ered the possibility of re-opening. According to the protocols established byWorkSafeBC, bars and nightclubs were allowed to do so provided they followedcertain safety procedures. Pumpjack was among the first gay pubs—in thegayborhood, no less—to reopen in June2020.The staff receivedpersonal protec-tive equipment, which ensured that guests were served by someone wearing amaskor a face shield. The owner also installedPlexiglas around the bar, along thewindows in the front that face the street, and in between the booths. “It’s going tobe a new experience,” said Byron Cooke, the general manager. This sentiment ofcautious optimism was shared by bar owners across Canada. Dean Odorico, thegeneral manager of gay bar Woody’s in Toronto, added, “The gay communityhas already lived through a health crisis with AIDS and it brought the commu-nity together and it made it a lot stronger…People at the time thought it was theend of days and it definitely wasn’t…The gay community is so resilient.”13(5) The COVID-19 pandemic offers new possibilities—available to wider audi-ences—for establishing virtual communities, not only to replace but alsoenhance previous ways of connecting.The final generative effect related to the COVID-19 pandemic is a reimag-ining of the possibilities of the virtual: what it is, how it works, and who feelsincluded within it. In August 2020, Global News published the following head-line: “The showmust go on(line): Vancouver hosts virtual parade amid COVID-19.”14 Rather than canceling Pride, as some cities did, the Vancouver PrideSociety (VPS) announced that it would shift its celebrations to a series of onlineevents (see Fig. 17.9). “Pride can’t be cancelled,” the non-profit organizationdeclared –“only re-imagined.”Organizersworked tirelessly, andquickly to iden-tify creative alternatives to in-person events. InMay, VPS issued a press release:“Vancouver Pride 2020 will go ahead as a virtual reimagining!”15 The releaseoutlined a week-long events lineup for the newly dubbed “Virtual Pride 2020.”Highlights included aVirtual Pride Parade, a dedicated day of queer weddings atcity hall, and a public (again virtual) disco. VPS also agreed to issue refunds tothose who needed themmost, and they agreed to pay trans, two-spirit, and queerartists, performers, and musicians as they transitioned their events into a digitalspace. In a public statement, VPS expressed gratitude, and a generative spirit:“We are so thankful for our Pride family and partners, and for your continuedsupport as we now shift towards creating a different kind of Pride celebration– but one which continues to celebrate diversity and bring us together when weneed it most.”16 On the day of the event, British Columbia Premier John Horgan13https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/qj4bgx/queer-nightlife-will-find-a-way-through-covid-19.14https://globalnews.ca/news/7246594/coronavirus-vancouver-virtual-pride-parade/.15https://www.insidevancouver.ca/2020/05/19/vancouver-pride-2020-will-be-virtual/.16https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/vancouver-pride-parade-cancelled-virtual.408 S. Miles et al.Fig. 17.9 Many LGBTQ+ celebrations in 2020 switched from in-person to virtual events, includethe Pride event in Buffalo, New York (Source Buffalo Pride Week, used with permission)tweeted photos of himself at previous parades and wrote, “missing celebrating#VancouverPride in person. But Pride cannot be cancelled.”17Cities like London, Denver, and Dublin also held virtual Pride events duringthe summer of 2020. This prompted the New York Times to publish an offi-cial “2020 Virtual Pride Guide.” The journalist Maya Salam, noted, “LGBTQPride events will look and feel very different this year, but many are still on– online.”18 Salam acknowledged that “in the era of the coronavirus, travelingand gathering are not options for many. But that should not hinder the spiritand mission of Pride: to remind community members and allies that they arenot alone, but part of a greater push for equality, and to elevate the voices andcauses central to LGBTQ+ people and other marginalized groups.” The global17https://www.citynews1130.com/2020/08/02/vancouver-pride-virtual-parade/.18https://www.nytimes.com/article/gay-pride-2020-events-online.html.17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 409reimagining of Pride—and its inherent symbolism—demonstrates with partic-ular force the resilience of urban queer communities in a worldwide crisis.Whether a virtual pride celebration can capture the same spirit as its physicalmanifestation remains up for debate. Certainly a crowded, enthusiastic, oftensweaty in-person parade becomes impossible, while other elements are compro-mised or reconfigured, with varying degrees of success. These elements, so keyto a physical pride celebration, were no doubt in many cases poorly replicatedonline in this uncertain year. However, if we recognize alternative potentialsof online pride celebrations—whether inclusivity, accessibility, or creativity, ofdifferent community members—then there may yet prove to be a generativefuture for online and hybrid gayborhood community events. See Fig. 17.10.17.3 Concluding Remarks: Beyond the Master Metaphorof the Gayborhood?This edited volume has focused on the past, present, and possible futures of gaybor-hoods. One critique of the prefix “gay” as a descriptor for these urban areas isthat it overemphasizes gay male experience, while potentially erasing others in the“LGBTQ+” acronym. The reasons for strategically retaining “gay” were noted inthe first chapter of this book (Hess and Bitterman 2021), but what garners less crit-ical questioning is the latter part of the “gayborhood” portmanteau. In a strict sense,neighborhood denotes a spatial concentration of people and organizations whosefeatures contribute to group identity. However, the term also connotes collectivity,togetherness, and many other qualities that are favorably regarded in most culturalcontexts. Accordingly, deploying the term “gayborhood” gathers a positive charge,and its potential decline or disappearance is tacitly treated as a negative develop-ment. Yet, while the term “neighborhood” certainly directs attention toward certainphenomena, it also delimits other understandings from emerging. This is problem-atic during a paradigm-shifting event such as a global pandemic. What if somethingnew—something different and as of yet unnamed—is being formed that we cannotadequately capture, or properly consider, by our conventional cognitive schemasabout LGBTQ+ urban spaces and places? Is it possible that “the gayborhood” is nolonger the most appropriate archetype for discussions about LGBTQ+ spatiality ina post-COVID-19 era?Spatial metaphors abound in studies of sexuality and gender. Take “the closet,”a concept interrogated by Sedgwick (1990) and also immediately recognizableto LGBTQ+ people and heterosexuals alike. The closet creates an internal spacewith connotations of claustrophobia and containment, but also safety and comfort,depending on the circumstances (Pantazopolous and Bettany 2010). For years theemphasis was on the negative, with the assumption that everyone wants to “comeout” if they can (Cass 1979). Yet, familiarity with a restrained space like the closetmight help in the era of COVID-19. After all, what is home quarantine if not a largercloset?410 S. Miles et al.Fig. 17.10 In-person Pride events occurred during summer 2020 in certain cities, including thisone in New York City, despite the COVID-19 pandemic (Source Image by Anne Hanavan)17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 411The relationship between the closet and lockdowns may actually be closer thaninitially conceived. National and local lockdowns have been used to slow the trans-mission of COVID-19. Although the specifics vary, lockdowns usually involverestricting movements and activities (see Fig. 17.11). In extreme cases, people areFig. 17.11 In LGBTQ+ neighborhoods, residents and visitors complied with the safety precautionsrequired by the COVID-19 pandemic (Source Image by Elizabeth R. June)412 S. Miles et al.Fig. 17.12 Retail and commercial outlets in gay neighborhoods adapted to COVID-19-relatedregulations (Source Image by Rob Modzelewski)locked down at home or in another domesticated space (e.g., a hotel room), withcommercial premises closed and access to public places constricted. See Fig. 17.12.Evidently, lockdowns have a huge impact on the viability and vitality of most non-residential sites including, as noted above, gayborhoods. Most commentators mayconclude that lockdowns are a temporary phenomenon, soon to be resigned to theannals of history as a peculiar feature of 2020. However, as lockdowns continuedinto 2021, and if they are reinstated in response to future pandemics, they likely willemerge as a new socio-spatial archetype in the collective consciousness. By this wemean that lockdowns might form a way of thinking about social and spatial relation-ships that transcends particular historical and geographical contexts, just as the term“ghetto” has left its origins in Venice to be applied to a variety of contexts (Ghaziani2015; Coffin et al. 2016). Might young LGBTQ+ people grow up thinking of theirdynamic coming out experiences as varying degrees of lockdown, rather than timespent in a closet?Then again, those who have yet to disclose their non-heteronormative identitymay be under increased scrutiny when they are sharing a small space with signifi-cant others for extended periods of time. Lockdown conditions may make the closetmore claustrophobic than ever (see Fig. 17.13). Since the outset of the pandemic,acute mental distress and suicidal ideation has been alarmingly high for adolescents17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 413Fig. 17.13 Even with safety precautions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, LGBTQ+neighborhoods can provide a welcoming space for everyone (Source Image by Rob Modzelewski)414 S. Miles et al.and young people, but for LGBTQ+ youth who are forced to move from the rela-tive freedom that schools, colleges and houseshares offered back to their childhoodhomes, mental health is drastically affected. “Re-closeting” their sexuality—to tran-sition from visibility to invisibility and silence once again—to their families, whomay be conservative, unaccepting, vehemently opposed to the individual’s sexu-ality or indeed unaware of it, is incredibly distressing (Batty 2020a, b; Dasgupta2020; LGBT Foundation 2020; Kneale and Bacares 2020). The conceptual upshot ofthis is that lockdown may need to be reconceptualized. It is not simply a temporaryphenomenon but perhaps an emergent frame that shapes the experiences of LGBTQ+people. As such it warrants further consideration as a complement to, if not evolutionof, the closet concept.Living alone may alleviate the claustrophobia of (re-)closeted lockdown, butbrings with it the potential for isolation, loneliness, and withdrawal. One solu-tion is to escape into online spaces, which leads to a second spatial metaphor thatis commonplace in contemporary discussions. In material terms, the Internet is acomplex network of cables, satellites, and mobile devices. Figuratively, however,it is a series of sites that one can visit, explore, and inhabit for a time. Considerterms like internet forum, online marketplace, and virtual waiting room. Space is thefoundational, albeit often implicit, figure of thinking for digitally mediated subjec-tivity (Miles 2021). Might the over-spatialization of internet interactivity precludealternative understandings of how electronic technologies enfold into physical real-ities (Coffin 2021)? For example, smartphones suggest that the internet is no longera separate topology of virtual spaces but rather another layer of spatiality overlainunevenly onto physical topographies (Šimůnková 2019). Devices are tracked in real-time and also real space, with dating applications often organizing users by distance,and customer reviews allowing photographs and descriptions to be viewed before aphysical place is encountered in the flesh.19 Thus, technology not only generates newspaces in the imagination (e.g., purely virtual fora), but it also distorts physical spatialexperiences (i.e. decreasing the possibility of “direct” or unmediated experience ofplace). What term can replace the dichotomy between offline and online space? Wepropose the term topology, which invokes a sense of space defined by its dynamicrelations rather than fixed physical or abstract features (Cresswell 2013).Topologies link back to lockdowns, insofar as technology also allows people tocommunicate online and then meet in physical locations. During times of lockdown,peoplemaymeet at each other’s homes, but in less restrictive phases peoplemaymeetin public places or commercial premises. Technologies certainly facilitate clandestinepractices such as cruising in public parks, which are affectively charged with asense of danger during a pandemic, but also allow any commercial site to become atemporary LGBTQ+meeting place. If socio-spatial relationships becomemore fluid,thanks to the interaction of technological affordances and lockdown restrictions, thenperhaps topology is the most appropriate trope through which to think about the19Asone illustrative speculation:will gaybars andotherLGBTQ+commercial environments receivea crowd-sourced “cleanliness” or “hygiene” rating and, if so, how might the added business costsand consumer concerns shape the ongoing viability of those already struggling to survive?17 After/Lives: Insights from the COVID-19 … 415future of LGBTQ+ cultures. Certainly the flexible and fleeting metaphor of topologyshould be complemented by other concepts. For instance, while many sites maybe fleetingly “queered” the term “archipelago” remains apt to describe the morestable landscape of regularly used and explicitly identified LGBTQ+ sites (Ghaziani2019a). Similarly, terms like circuit (Ghaziani and Cook 2005), scene (Ridge et al.1997; Taylor 2010) and pop-up (Stillwagon and Ghaziani 2019) may be useful todescribe particular topological formations for LGBTQ+ people. Indeed, we celebratemetaphorical multiplicity, as it may draw attention to a greater range of differencesbetween non-heterosexual people. However, we propose that topology is particularlyproductive as an agnostic or umbrella term, insofar as it can also be transferred beyondthe specific context of post-pandemic queer spatiality. In doing so, it can articulate theunique contingencies of queer topologies but also their connections to the shiftingspatialities of BAME topologies, feminist topologies, religious topologies, and thelike. Thus, it is apposite to conclude this chapter, and the edited volume, with apregnant proposition: the life and afterlives of gayborhoods is the conception ofplural queer topologies.ReferencesAndersson J (2009) East end localism and urban decay: Shoreditch’s re-emerging gay scene.

    "abstract": "This open access book examines the significance of gay neighborhoods (or ‘gayborhoods’) from critical periods of formation during the gay liberation and freedom movements of the 1960s and 1970s, to proven durability through the HIV/AIDS pandemic during the 1980s and 1990s, to a mature plateau since 2000. The book provides a framework for contemplating the future form and function of gay neighborhoods. Social and cultural shifts within gay neighborhoods are used as a framework for understanding the decades-long struggle for LGBTQ+ rights and equality. Resulting from gentrification, weakening social stigma, and enhanced rights for LGBTQ+ people, gay neighborhoods have recently become “less gay,” following a 50-year period of resilience. Meanwhile, other neighborhoods are becoming “more gay,” due to changing preferences of LGBTQ+ individuals and a propensity for LGBTQ+ families to form community in areas away from established gayborhoods. The current ‘plateau’ in the evolution of gay neighborhoods is characterized by generational differences—between Baby Boom pioneers and Millennials who favour broad inclusivity—signaling various possible trajectories for the future ‘afterlife’ of these important LGBTQ+ urban spaces. The complicating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic provides a point of comparison for lessons learned from gay neighborhoods and the LGBTQ+ community that bravely endured the onset of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. This book will be of interest to students and scholars in various disciplines—including sociology, social work, anthropology, gender and sexuality, LGTBQ+ and queer studies, as well as urban geography, architecture, and city planning—and to policymakers and advocates concerned with LGBTQ+ rights and social justice",
