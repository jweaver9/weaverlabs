CLAYTON COUNTY Anastasia E. Lacina*  The U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Bostock v. Clayton County expanded Title VII’s coverage of victims of sex discrimination in employment by interpreting the statute to also protect LGBTQ+ employees who were discriminated against because of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.  Although Bostock only applies precedentially to Title VII, the long and interwoven history of state antidiscrimination statutes shows that the ruling may reach beyond federal law. This Note examines state court cases that have considered whether to apply Bostock’s reasoning to the interpretation of state antidiscrimination statutes.  Furthermore, this Note argues in favor of a path forward in state courts for expanding LGBTQ+ legal protections.  The textualist reasoning of Bostock’s opinion—whether perceived or actual—should be highly persuasive to state court jurists, especially those in conservative states, which are more likely to have textualist judges.  Adopting Bostock at the state level has the potential to expand crucial legal rights and protections for millions of LGBTQ+ people.

Major initiatives practically guarantee them . . . .  [T]he limits of the drafters’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law’s demands.1 In 2018, Amanda Sims, an employee of Tarrant County in Fort Worth, Texas, came out as a lesbian to her supervisor of three years.2  The story that followed is one that is familiar to many LGBTQ+ people.  First, she began to receive explicitly hostile treatment from her supervisor.3  Then, her employer unexpectedly audited her for improper spending, which revealed no impropriety.4  After she reported suspected employment discrimination to a city commission on human relations, Sims was placed on administrative leave.5  Finally, in July 2019, Sims was fired for what she alleged were pretextual reasons.6  When Sims sued her employer in Texas state court, she   1.

Clayton County11 that federal law protected LGBTQ+ people from employment discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.12  Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,13 covered employers are prohibited from discriminating against their employees “because of . . . sex.”14  Focusing almost solely on the text of Title VII,15 Justice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, crafted a unique legal opinion, which held that Title VII’s prohibition of sex discrimination also prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.16 In the time since Bostock, many courts at both the federal and state levels have grappled with the consequences of the decision.17  Bostock’s interpretive holding only applies precedentially to Title VII, which regulates only certain types of employers and employees.18  But state antidiscrimination laws can provide stronger protections by covering more employees and offering broader remedies to claimants.19  Additionally, it was unclear whether Bostock’s reasoning could apply to nonemployment antidiscrimination statutes, on either the state or federal level.20  Thus, claims like Amanda Sims’s—which was brought under state antidiscrimination laws—were placed in legal limbo.21  If the Bostock decision influences state courts’ interpretations of state law, it could expand legal protections for   7.

Although state courts have addressed Bostock’s applicability to nonemployment antidiscrimination statutory provisions, see infra Parts II.B–C, this Note often uses state and federal employment law as representative of antidiscrimination law as a whole.  Scholarship in this area is often focused on employment law. See, e.g., sources cited infra notes 25, 32, 54.  21. See, e.g., Supplemental Brief of Appellant at 5, Love v. Young, 320 So. 3d 259 (Fla.

Part II assesses how state courts have applied or not applied Bostock to state antidiscrimination statutes that are analogous to Title VII.  Part III lays out arguments for both sides of the issue that state courts now face:  whether to apply Bostock’s reasoning to their own state antidiscrimination laws.  Finally, Part IV argues in favor of Bostock’s applicability to state antidiscrimination statutes. I.  ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAW:  A PATCHWORK QUILT The Bostock decision rests on decades of judicial precedent and statutory civil rights law,23 and it cannot be fully understood without an examination of those historical developments.  Part I.A discusses the history of federal antidiscrimination law, with a focus on the Civil Rights Act of 196424 (“1964 Act”).  Part I.B examines state antidiscrimination laws, as well as the current state landscape for LGBTQ+ legal protections.  Part I.C examines the Bostock opinion in depth and situates it within the current political and legal context. A.  A History of Federal Antidiscrimination Law Statutory antidiscrimination law is a relatively recent phenomenon in the United States.25  Despite the Civil War amendments26 and Reconstruction laws27 during the mid-nineteenth century, the modern statutory framework for federal antidiscrimination law began with the 1964 Act.28  The 1964 Act and its amendments prohibit discrimination “because of” race, color, religion, national origin, and sex in federally funded education29 (Title IX) and private employment30 (Title VII).  The 1964 Act also prohibits discrimination in public accommodations because of race, color, religion,   22. CHRISTY MALLORY ET AL., LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR LGBT PEOPLE AFTER BOSTOCK V.

For example, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 196734 expanded Title VII employment protections to age discrimination,35 whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act of 199036 expanded both employment and public accommodation protections to people with disabilities.37  As a result, antidiscrimination law on the federal level is somewhat fractured and scattered across a variety of statutory provisions.38 Sexual orientation and gender identity are not explicitly named protected characteristics under the 1964 Act or its amendments.39  Congress has not yet passed any amendments or comprehensive statutes to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination.40  Consequently, most progress on LGBTQ+ civil rights at the federal level has come from federal courts, especially the Supreme Court.41  For example, in Romer v. Evans,42 the Court struck down a discriminatory state constitutional amendment,43 holding that the   31. Id. § 2000a(a).  32. See Sandra F.

The Current State Law Landscape Since the nation’s founding, states have had the power to regulate sexual and marital relationships.46  In 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage when the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that its state constitution guaranteed same-sex couples the right to marry.47  In the years that followed, other states exhibited both backlash and progress:  while at least ten states also legalized same-sex marriage, over thirty states passed laws or constitutional amendments prohibiting it.48  After same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide,49 LGBTQ+ activists shifted their focus to address other areas of law, such as conversion therapy,50 transgender health-care coverage,51 and antidiscrimination statutes.52 Currently, all fifty states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have at least one sex discrimination statute on the books.53  Forty-seven states prohibit private employment discrimination on the basis of sex,54 forty-five states prohibit sex discrimination in public accommodations,55 and forty-nine states prohibit sex discrimination in housing.56  In contrast, only twenty-one states have full protections for LGBTQ+ people—based on sexual orientation and gender identity—in employment, public   44.

Laws against sodomy and buggery existed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries but were rarely enforced in the United States. Id.

For example, many state employment statutes do not mirror Title VII’s two-part structure, which distinguishes between disparate treatment and disparate impact claims.71  As discussed, state statutes are often simpler in language and structure than their scattered federal counterparts.72  State statutes may also employ slightly different causality language:  for instance, “on the grounds of” instead of “because of,”73 or “gender” instead of “sex.”74 State antidiscrimination laws can also be more friendly to plaintiffs and claimants than federal law.75  To use employment law as an example, Title VII generally only applies to employers with more than fifteen employees who have worked there for at least twenty weeks.76  In comparison, many states’ employment statutes apply to much more of the workforce.77  For instance, New York’s employment discrimination statute applies to every employer in the state.78  In addition, damages for successful plaintiffs under Title VII are capped at $50,000 for small businesses and $300,000 for the largest corporations.79  Many states, in contrast, provide uncapped   68.

Clayton County.98 In Bostock, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that Title VII’s prohibition against sex discrimination includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.99  Writing for the majority, Justice Gorsuch used well-known tools of statutory interpretation100 to analyze the relevant provision of Title VII: It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.101 The Court construed “because of” to refer to a traditional but-for causation test:  “If the employer intentionally relies in part on an individual employee’s   89.

The two individuals are, to the employer’s mind, materially identical in all respects, except that one is a man and the other a woman.  If the employer fires the male employee for no reason other than the fact he is attracted to men, the employer discriminates against him for traits or actions it tolerates in his female colleague.103 The same principle applied for transgender employees:  if an employer has two otherwise identical women—one assigned female at birth and one assigned male at birth—and fires the employee assigned male at birth, then the employer intentionally discriminated against that employee because of her sex.104 For the Court, sexual orientation and gender identity are “inextricably bound up with sex.”105  Thus, sex does not have to be the primary or sole reason for discrimination but just one of many but-for causes.106  The Court pointed to several Title VII precedents to support this reasoning.107  For example, the Court pointed to Phillips v. Martin Marietta Corp.,108 in which the Court had ruled that an employer who rejected female applicants with young children, but accepted male applicants with young children, violated Title VII’s prohibition against sex discrimination.109  Although the employer may have based its decision primarily on a separate criterion—the presence of young children—the employee’s sex was nevertheless a but-for cause of the discriminatory conduct.110  By analogy, even if a discriminatory employer is motivated by the sex to which the employee is attracted, it does not erase the fact that the employer also discriminated because of the employee’s sex.111   102. Bostock, 140 S. Ct. at 1741.  The Court noted that both parties disputed whether the term “sex” in Title VII referred solely to biological characteristics (the employers’ view) or whether it also included gender roles and norms (the employees’ view).

The majority disregarded the employers’ claim that the decision would “sweep beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws,” saying that “none of these other laws are before us . . . today.”120  Justice Alito, in his dissent, also identified over   112.

STATE COURT EXPANSION OF BOSTOCK State courts are bound by Bostock’s interpretation of Title VII, just as federal courts are.125  However, despite early speculation,126 it was unclear whether states would defer to the Supreme Court and choose to apply Bostock’s reasoning to areas of state law127—and if so, whether they would limit Bostock’s application to employment law.  Almost two years since Bostock, several states with statutory provisions against sex discrimination—but not against sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination—have encountered the issue of how to apply Bostock’s reasoning to state law.128  State courts have encountered the issue not only in employment discrimination cases but also in public accommodation and ethnic-intimidation cases.129   121.

Specifically, it surveys the five state cases that have addressed the issue of whether Bostock’s reasoning should apply to state antidiscrimination statutes.  Part II.A addresses two employment discrimination cases from Texas and Ohio.  Part II.B discusses two public accommodations cases from Florida and Michigan.  Finally, Part II.C considers one case involving an ethnic-intimidation criminal statute from Michigan. A.  Employment Discrimination Cases Texas was one of the first states to address Bostock’s applicability in a state law context.  Texas’s state antidiscrimination statute—the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act130 (TCHRA)—provides, in part, that “[a]n employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of . . . sex . . . the employer . . . discriminates . . . against an individual [in the terms of employment].”131  The TCHRA explicitly states that the purpose of the law is, inter alia, to “provide for the execution of the policies of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”132 In February 2020, Amanda Sims sued her employer under the Texas state constitution for firing her because of her sexual orientation.133  She did not make a claim under the TCHRA, which both parties agreed did not prohibit sexual orientation discrimination.134  But while her case was on appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Bostock.135  Eventually, in Tarrant County College District v. Sims,136 the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit of Texas at Dallas held that the TCHRA’s prohibition against sex discrimination also prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, “[i]n light of Bostock.”137  The court reasoned that since no Texas state court had weighed in on the issue of whether the TCHRA covered LGBTQ+ discrimination, it would look to analogous federal law for guidance.138  The court noted that both Title VII and the TCHRA prohibited employment discrimination “because of . . . sex.”139  After analyzing Bostock’s reasoning,140 the court concluded that it “must follow Bostock” in order to “reconcile and conform the TCHRA with federal anti-discrimination”   130.

The court specifically quoted an excerpt from Bostock emphasizing the importance of the text of Title VII:  “When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it’s no contest.  Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.” Id. at 329 (quoting Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1737 (2020)). 2022] SMALL GESTURES AND UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES 2407 laws.141  In reaching the conclusion that it “must” conform with Bostock, the court emphasized the purpose of the TCHRA—to “coordinate and conform” with federal antidiscrimination laws—and precedent from the Texas Supreme Court, which had looked to federal courts for guidance when the TCHRA and Title VII had similar language.142 In another case, an Ohio state court recognized, in dicta, the potential applicability of Bostock to Ohio state law.143  Ohio’s antidiscrimination statute has language almost identical to both Texas’s law and Title VII:  Ohio also prohibits discrimination in employment “because of . . . sex.”144  In Nance v. Lima Auto Mall, Inc.,145 the Court of Appeals for the Third Appellate District of Ohio upheld a trial court’s dismissal of a claim under Ohio’s antidiscrimination statute for lack of facts to sustain a claim.146  However, in dicta, the court addressed the applicability of Bostock to Ohio’s antidiscrimination law.147  Citing Ohio case law asserting that federal antidiscrimination law is generally applicable when interpreting Ohio state antidiscrimination law,148 the court stated that a claim of sexual orientation discrimination in Ohio “could potentially have a basis in law under Bostock.”149 B.  Public Accommodations Cases Although Bostock itself is limited to employment discrimination under Title VII, some courts—both state and federal—have applied Bostock’s reasoning to other areas of antidiscrimination law with similar statutory schemes.150  One of these areas is discrimination in public accommodations, which is regulated on the federal level by Title II of the 1964 Act.151 The Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992152 (FCRA) prohibits, in part, discrimination in places of public accommodation “on the ground of . . . sex.”153  In Love v. Young,154 the First District Court of Appeal of Florida declined to address the issue of whether the FCRA also prohibits   141. Id. (emphasis added).  142. See id. at 328.  143. Nance v.

Bilbrey argued in favor of Bostock’s applicability to the FCRA, even in public accommodations cases.159  Judge Bilbrey cited opinions from the Florida Commission on Human Relations160 (FCHR), the purpose of the FCRA,161 and Florida case law162 to show that applying Bostock to the FCRA was consistent with Florida law.163  Although the plurality dismissed the dissent’s reasoning as dicta,164 Judge Bilbrey also noted that because of the fractured nature of the panel’s plurality opinion, Love establishes no binding precedent in Florida.165 In Michigan, the Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act166 (ELCRA) forbids the denial of the “full and equal enjoyment of . . . public service because of . . . sex.”167  Like in Title VII, “sex” is not defined in the ELCRA, so Michigan courts have interpreted its meaning over the past forty years.168  In Barbour v.

Michigan Department of Civil Rights,173 the court assessed whether the Michigan Department of Civil Rights’s Interpretive Statement 2018-1, which construed the ELCRA’s prohibition against sex discrimination to include both sexual orientation and gender identity,174 was valid under Michigan law.175  Under Barbour, the court concluded that its interpretation regarding sexual orientation was invalid, although it left open the possibility that Barbour was “no longer valid” in light of Bostock.176  The Rouch World court also concluded, however, that gender identity discrimination was properly included under the ELCRA.177  In reaching that conclusion, the court noted that the Michigan Supreme Court—in remanding a related case, People v. Rogers178—had ordered the lower court to reconsider their decision in light of Bostock.179  Thus, because of the Michigan Supreme Court’s directive in Rogers, the Rouch World court followed Bostock’s reasoning in its own case and held that gender identity discrimination was included under the ELCRA.180  After the trial court’s decision in Rouch World, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights appealed directly to the Michigan Supreme Court on the issue of whether the ELCRA applied to discrimination based on sexual orientation—essentially asking the court to overturn Barbour.181  The Michigan Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal.182   170.

Ethnic-Intimidation Cases Before Rouch World, another Michigan court weighed in on Bostock’s applicability to state law for an ethnic-intimidation statute that prohibited intimidation or harassment of another person because of, inter alia, their “gender.”183  In Rogers, the defendant allegedly harassed a transgender woman because of her gender identity and threatened her with a gun.184  The defendant was charged under an ethnic-intimidation statute,185 which prohibited crimes motivated by animus “because of . . . gender.”186  Both the Michigan trial court and intermediate appellate court187 originally held that the statute did not include crimes motivated by animus against transgender people,188 but on appeal, the Michigan Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of Bostock.189  On remand, the appellate court reversed, interpreting the ethnic-intimidation statute in line with Bostock.190 Although the Michigan appellate court interpreted “gender” to include transgender status, it also specified that Bostock “does not control the outcome of this case,” although it should be afforded “respectful consideration.”191  Ultimately, the court interpreted “gender” as synonymous with “sex” as the term was used at the time of enactment.192  Thus, the defendant’s alleged conduct was covered by the statute because “were it not for the complainant’s biological sex (male), defendant would not have harassed and intimidated her.”193 III.  TO APPLY OR NOT TO APPLY:  THE DEBATE IN STATE COURTS In the aftermath of Bostock, state courts have employed the decision’s reasoning to analogous state antidiscrimination laws to varying degrees.

Furthermore, the court noted: [Federal] precedent cannot be allowed to rewrite Michigan law.  The persuasiveness of federal precedent can only be considered after the statutory differences between Michigan and federal law have been fully assessed, and, of course, even when this has been done and language in state statutes is compared to similar language in federal statutes, federal precedent remains only as persuasive as the quality of its analysis.

Id. 2022] SMALL GESTURES AND UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES 2411 doing so, these courts have grappled with issues of statutory interpretation, principles of federalism, and public policy.194  This part discusses the main justifications for and against applying Bostock to state antidiscrimination laws.  Some arguments are primarily derived from scholarly commentary about state antidiscrimination law in general,195 whereas others come from Bostock’s majority and dissenting opinions. A.  Bostock Is Applicable to State Statutes Three state courts that have addressed the issue of Bostock’s applicability have concluded that state antidiscrimination statutes should be interpreted in line with federal law.196  This section addresses three main reasons—articulated by both scholars and state courts—for why federal and state antidiscrimination law should be consistent in this area.  Part III.A.1 examines the intentions of state legislatures.  Part III.A.2 discusses the persuasiveness of the textualist roots of Bostock.  Finally, Part III.A.3 addresses reasons of public policy, including uniformity in the law. 1.  The Intentions of State Legislatures The intent of a legislature, especially when explicitly stated in the statutory text, has often been considered persuasive for courts interpreting that statute.197  Although some states passed antidiscrimination statutes before the 1964 Act,198 the concept of antidiscrimination laws—particularly ones that address sex-based discrimination—was a relatively new phenomenon in the 1960s.199  After federal antidiscrimination statutes were passed, similar statutes flooded the states.200  State statutes that explicitly require “forced consistency” with federal law are relatively rare.201  However, the historical link and dialogue between federal and state antidiscrimination law can be a strong indicator of state legislative intent.202  The 1964 Act and the state statutes that preceded it follow a common federalist trend:  “Sometimes,   194. See infra Parts III.A–B.  195. Because much of the scholarship in this area is focused on employment law, this part will frequently use employment law as representative of antidiscrimination law in general.

Goldfarb, supra note 200, at 90.  204. See infra note 206 and accompanying text.  205. For these purposes, “identical language” means that the state statute includes the key interpretive language that the Bostock Court relied on:  “because of,” “sex,” and “discrimination.”  The fourteen states are as follows:  Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wyoming.

Textualism and Strengthening the Link Between Title VII and Similarly Worded Statutes Textualism—the judicial theory of primarily or solely analyzing the text to interpret a statute—has become the core of modern statutory interpretation.211  Justice Kagan once famously said, “[W]e’re all textualists now.”212  Textualism purports to offer a “politically neutral” method of statutory interpretation by focusing only on the text of the statute.213  However, textualism continues to be associated with a conservative judicial ideology typically espoused by conservative judges.214 The self-proclaimed textualist nature of Bostock’s reasoning may be compelling for state courts, especially in more conservative states.  In the majority opinion, Justice Gorsuch focused almost solely on the text of Title VII,215 as well as Title VII case law.216  Almost the entire analysis rested on four words in the statute:  “because of,” “sex,” and “discrimination.”217  Technically, Justice Gorsuch’s reasoning in Bostock could apply to any analogous statute with identical language.218  There was very little in the opinion that was specific to Title VII itself or to Title VII federal case law.219  Consequently, Bostock may be particularly relevant and applicable to state statutes with wording identical to Title VII. For example, Texas’s, Ohio’s, and Michigan’s statutes have identical language when it comes to those four words.220  The Tarrant County court specifically identified the similarity between Title VII and the Texas antidiscrimination statute as a reason for applying Bostock.221  The Rouch World court in Michigan also identified Title VII as a provision “analogous”   210.

Uniformity and Certainty as Compelling Legal Interests Public policy arguments for uniformity and federal deference may also play a role in state courts’ decision-making.225  Some scholars maintain that reputational concerns for state judges argue in favor of deferring to federal courts, even when interpreting state law.226  In addition, state courts have often stated that uniformity in antidiscrimination law—on both the federal and state levels—is a compelling reason to defer to federal law.227  Not only can uniformity reduce uncertainty for potential plaintiffs and defendants,228 but it also eases the burden on state and federal judges, who are often interpreting state law concurrently.229  With their much larger caseload,230 it is far easier for state courts to look to federal precedent for guidance than to interpret state law completely independently.231  Furthermore, there is also a sense that civil rights, in particular, is an area of the law where states should follow the federal government’s lead,232 especially given the history of U.S. civil rights law233:  “If a right is fundamental to our national conception of justice, it must not disappear or diminish as one crosses state lines.”234 As an example of this concern for uniformity, in Rouch World, the Michigan court implied that inconsistency in Michigan public accommodations law was detrimental to the state.235  Under Barbour—the pre-Bostock state precedent—“sex” does not include sexual orientation in   222.

With Barbour’s reasoning based on decades-old statutory interpretation and Rouch World’s reasoning based on analogous federal law, there is now doubt in Michigan as to how LGBTQ+ people are treated under the ELCRA.238  In light of this, the Rouch World court cast doubt on the validity of the Barbour precedent after Bostock.239 B.  Bostock Is Irrelevant to State Law Alternatively, some argue that Bostock’s reasoning is inapplicable when interpreting state antidiscrimination laws.  One of the primary arguments in favor of this position is the federalist principle of state independence from the federal government.240  In addition, some courts may not find the textualist reasoning of Bostock compelling.241  Part III.B.1 addresses the argument that states should independently interpret their own statutes in accordance with federalist principles.  Part III.B.2 discusses the flaws in Bostock’s textualism and addresses how these flaws could make the decision’s reasoning less compelling to state courts. 1.  Federalism and the Independence of the States Federalism is the concept of separation of powers between the federal government and state governments.242  With some exceptions,243 state legislatures and courts are the ultimate determiners of state law.244  Although a sense of deference to federal law among state judges is strong,245 the sense of independence from federal courts is probably equally as strong.246   236.

In People v. Rogers, the Michigan appellate court initially rejected the usefulness of Bostock and federal law in general when interpreting Michigan state law.259  Although the appellate court reversed on remand to be consistent with Bostock,260 the court clarified that federal precedent could not rewrite Michigan law.261  They were bound by precedent from the Michigan Supreme Court, and in analyzing Michigan law, they determined that Bostock “[did] not control the outcome of th[e] case.”262 The power of states to enact and interpret their own laws, independent of federal law, is an important characteristic of American democracy.263  It is partially due to this independence—as well as the efforts of LGBTQ+ activists—that same-sex marriage was legalized first throughout the states and then nationwide.264  State sovereignty is a basic tenet of the dynamic between the national government, states, and their citizens.265  For this reason, the federalist argument may be compelling to state judges interpreting state antidiscrimination laws. 2.  The Flawed Textualism of Bostock Some scholars also argue that Bostock’s reasoning is not as textualist as the majority claimed.266  For instance, Professor Marc Spindelman posits that extratextual federal precedent on Title VII played a significant role in Bostock’s reasoning,267 making it potentially inapplicable to other statutes.268  Although Bostock’s logic may justify the possibility of interpreting Title VII to include anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, some critics argue that it does not adequately justify its interpretive choice that Title VII   258.

App. Aug. 5, 2021) (noting the differences between Title VII and the Michigan statute at issue). 2418 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 90 must be interpreted that way.269  Instead, Bostock implicitly relied on several extratextual sources, including federal Title VII case law and the Supreme Court’s constitutional law jurisprudence on LGBTQ+ issues.270 For instance, the Bostock Court cited to several other Title VII cases that held that sexual harassment and discrimination based on motherhood both violate Title VII.271  These precedents are not binding on state antidiscrimination laws, and may not even be persuasive, since some state laws have separate statutory provisions forbidding sexual harassment and discrimination based on parenthood.272 In addition, Professor Spindelman argues that the Bostock Court was heavily influenced by the Supreme Court’s line of constitutional law cases on LGBTQ+ issues,273 from Romer to Obergefell v. Hodges.274  In interpreting Title VII, he argues, the Bostock Court “affirms that principles of constitutional justice, as they have developed, remain principles of legal justice, too.”275  The Bostock Court extracted the constitutional principle of LGBTQ+ equality under the law—evident from its own precedents over the past forty years—and applied it to a federal statute.276  These constitutional norms and principles are binding on states, but they cannot be explicitly found in a textualist approach to interpreting Title VII.  Thus, state courts interpreting similarly worded state statutes may find Bostock’s reasoning to be unpersuasive because of these extratextual factors at play in the decision. IV.  A PATH FORWARD FOR STATE COURTS AFTER BOSTOCK As time passes, more state courts will begin to grapple with the issue of Bostock’s applicability to their own antidiscrimination statutes.277  These state courts will be faced with differing statutes, with diverse histories and varying judicial precedent.  Despite these distinctions, however, Bostock offers a powerful basis for state courts to expand protections for LGBTQ+ Americans beyond what federal law may provide. This part argues that state courts should apply Bostock’s reasoning when interpreting state antidiscrimination statutes, which would extend significant protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.  Part IV.A argues that Bostock’s reasoning should be compelling to state judges specifically because of its textualist identity.  Part IV.B rebuts the contention that principles of   269.

See supra Part II. 2022] SMALL GESTURES AND UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES 2419 federalism should outweigh Bostock’s influence on state courts.  Finally, Part IV.C acknowledges the limitations of using Bostock as a basis for sexual orientation and gender identity antidiscrimination law, but nevertheless concludes that the practical benefits of expanding LGBTQ+ rights far outweigh the disadvantages. A.  The Persuasiveness of Bostock in the Age of Textualism Many states, because of legal history and legislative intent, have antidiscrimination statutes with wording very similar, if not identical, to their federal counterparts.278  The common textual differences between federal and state statutes—mainly the “omnibus” structure of state law compared to scattered federal laws,279 as well as the number of characteristics protected280—are irrelevant to the core of Bostock’s textualist reasoning.  In examining the text of Title VII, the Bostock Court’s analysis focused almost solely on the framework of four words:  “because of,” “sex,” and “discrimination.”281  Although Bostock is admittedly influenced by statutory and constitutional precedent,282 the binary logic of the decision remains:  if an employer has two otherwise identical employees—one male and one female, who are both married to men—and the employer fires the male employee—but not the female employee—because of his sexual orientation, then that employer has technically discriminated against the male employee because of that employee’s sex.283  This reasoning would apply to any statute with the phrase “because of . . . sex.”284  It may be formalistic, literalist, or even “wooden,”285 but for judges in an age of textualism, it is nevertheless compelling,286 especially since many state statutes have similar, if not identical, language.287 State courts that (1) are interpreting statutes with key language identical to Title VII288 and that (2) have some signal from the state legislature or a higher court about using federal law for guidance289 should especially adopt Bostock as a gloss on their own antidiscrimination statutes.  In these states, the   278. See supra notes 85–86 and accompanying text.  279. See supra notes 61–62 and accompanying text.  280. See supra note 65 and accompanying text.  281.

Despite Justice Alito’s objections in his dissent,293 Bostock not only presents itself as a textualist opinion294 but also has been largely depicted as such in political and legal discourse.295  Justice Gorsuch has been characterized, either positively or negatively, as Justice Antonin Scalia’s textualist successor on an already conservative Supreme Court.296  His authorship of a decision that was a significant victory for progressive LGBTQ+ activists297 should be compelling in and of itself to state courts, especially courts in states without explicit LGBTQ+ antidiscrimination protections, which tend to be more conservative.298  Conservative state courts may be hesitant to interpret a statute to include antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ people,299 especially with such vigorous dissents from other conservative textualists like Justice Alito.300  But ultimately, these dissents fall flat by invoking traditionally anti-textualist methods of statutory interpretation, such as historical congressional intent.301  On the other hand, Bostock successfully assuages textualist fears by repeatedly stating that a court should only be concerned with the law as it is.302  By using a conservative tool of statutory interpretation to produce a progressive and   290.

Federalist Principles Should Not Limit States’ Abilities to Adopt Federal Law Proponents of federalism argue that states’ interpretations of state laws should be independent from federal law to preserve the historic sovereignty of the states,305 encourage innovation in the law,306 and reflect political differences between different states.307  But these arguments are inapplicable to the current political climate, as well as the issue of LGBTQ+ discrimination. First and foremost, explicit statutory text—as well as the historical and linguistic links between state and federal antidiscrimination statutes—often demonstrates a legislative intent to mirror Title VII.308  Examining legislative intent, whether derived through the text of the statute or through legislative history, is an accepted method of statutory interpretation.309  Because many state antidiscrimination statutes were passed pursuant to the 1964 Act, the statutes are intentionally worded very similarly.310  Some state legislatures, like Texas’s, included an explicit directive to interpret their state statutes in line with federal law.311  Now that Bostock has expanded the coverage of Title VII, state courts with statutory provisions like Texas’s should interpret their statutes in line with the decision.  In fact, it would be disregarding the will of the state legislature not to do so. In addition, state courts following Bostock as a matter of statutory interpretation do not violate federalist doctrines such as the anti-commandeering principle.312  The anti-commandeering principle forbids the federal government from “commandeering” state governments and actors to impose federal law.313  However, the anti-commandeering principle does not normally apply to state courts because the U.S. Constitution specifically requires state courts to enforce federal law.314    303. For example, two state courts that have explicitly adopted Bostock’s reasoning quoted explicitly textualist excerpts from Bostock. See Tarrant County, 621 S.W.3d at 329 (quoting an excerpt from Bostock focusing on textualist interpretation); Rouch World, LLC v. Mich. Dep’t of C.R., No. 20-000145-MZ, slip op. at 6 (Mich. Ct. Cl.

VI, cl. 2. 2422 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 90 Furthermore, Bostock does not command state courts to interpret state statutory uses of “sex” to include sexual orientation and gender identity, nor is there any precedential effect.315  State courts are free to disagree, as the Florida court in Love did.316 Furthermore, while it is true that the adoption of Bostock’s reasoning by state courts may not produce a “dialogue” between federal and state governments on LGBTQ+ antidiscrimination law,317 this lack of dialogue would not stifle innovation among the states.  With the current gridlock in Congress, the proposed federal Equality Act318—which would, among other things, codify Bostock’s holding in statutory federal law—is not close to becoming law.319  Any federal statutory protections for LGBTQ+ people are probably far in the future.  With Congress silent on this issue, the primary battleground for LGBTQ+ civil rights will continue to be in federal320 and state courts,321 as well as in state and local legislatures,322 just as the same-sex marriage movement played out.323  Achieving uniformity between federal and state antidiscrimination laws by adopting Bostock in state courts is a crucial step toward legal equality,324 and it does not erase the dialogue between the states regarding the details of antidiscrimination laws, such as remedies and procedural mechanisms.325  State antidiscrimination statutes have meaningful differences in how they address and remedy discrimination claims,326 and these differences can continue to foster an innovative dialogue about antidiscrimination law among the states.327 C.

This leaves LGBTQ+ employees with uncertainty in the law and doubt as to whether their employers can discriminate against them.331  Reducing uncertainty in civil rights law is particularly important because it eases the burden on minorities and other vulnerable groups332 who may already believe that they are protected from employment discrimination in all instances because of Bostock.333  Furthermore, now that all same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marriage, antidiscrimination protections are particularly important for LGBTQ+ people to resolve the “post-Obergefell paradox”334—mainly that “a gay person could be legally married in any of the fifty states on Saturday and fired from her job because of that marriage on Monday.”335 The benefits of expanding Bostock to state antidiscrimination statutes are significant.336  There are an estimated 3.6 million LGBTQ+ adults who would gain further employment protections under state law expansions.337  And an estimated 4.3 million LGBTQ+ people over the age of thirteen would gain protections in public accommodations.338  Bostock is admittedly an imperfect opinion:  its legal reasoning can feel “wooden” and overly literalist.339  Furthermore, some feminist scholars have criticized Bostock for failing to reckon with more inclusive legal theories, such as sex stereotyping,340 and for focusing more on textualist statutory interpretation   329.

And the implications of Bostock for both federal and state law are extensive. The five state court cases that have been litigated since June 2020 demonstrate that Bostock’s persuasiveness may spread beyond what the Supreme Court itself may have foreseen or intended.  Although Bostock expanded employment protections for millions of LGBTQ+ adults, 3.6 million working people are still unprotected from employment discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.351  While many state legislatures may continue to avoid the issue of LGBTQ+ civil rights, state courts must pick up the baton; Bostock, with its textualist principles and judicial authority, gives them a path to expanding LGBTQ+ legal equality.   349.

    "abstract": "The U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Bostock v. Clayton County expanded Title VII’s coverage of victims of sex discrimination in employment by interpreting the statute to also protect LGBTQ+ employees who were discriminated against because of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Although Bostock only applies precedentially to Title VII, the long and interwoven history of state antidiscrimination statutes shows that the ruling may reach beyond federal law. This Note examines state court cases that have considered whether to apply Bostock’s reasoning to the interpretation of state antidiscrimination statutes. Furthermore, this Note argues in favor of a path forward in state courts for expanding LGBTQ+ legal protections. The textualist reasoning of Bostock’s opinion—whether perceived or actual—should be highly persuasive to state court jurists, especially those in conservative states, which are more likely to have textualist judges. Adopting Bostock at the state level has the potential to expand crucial legal rights and protections for millions of LGBTQ+ people",
