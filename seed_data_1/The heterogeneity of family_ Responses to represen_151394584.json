It explores how LGBTQ parents respond to media 6 representations of families like theirs, and build narratives of family identity from limited 7 cultural resources. Media, encompassing a range of cultural representational resources, 8 including advertisements, television, books and films, produces specific knowledges about 9 LGBTQ families. Participants argued that popular entertainment media (including Modern 10 Family) offered a limited range of representations of LGBTQ parents and concretizes 11 knowledge about the shape of families. I argue that available representations fail to 12 acknowledge the diversity of non-heterosexual family forms and that this representational 13 gap results in socio-cultural invisibility. I explore the responses LGBTQ parents had to such 14 gaps and how they negotiated, or rejected representational meanings in order to consolidate 15 new narratives of family. 16 Keywords: 17 LGBTQ parents, parenting, media representation, culture, identity, family diversity, 18 qualitative, queer reading, LGBTQ issues.  19 Responses to representational invisibility  Introduction 20 The role of representation 21 Media is a core constituent of identity (Kellner, 2011). It is through a complex and 22 ongoing process of refusals, re-articulations and identifications with representation, that we 23 can craft a sense of self (Driver, 2007). Cultural representations, their restriction, availability, 24 and circulation “have real consequences for real people” (Dyer, 2002a, p.3) as they try to 25 craft stable lives and access socio-cultural legitimation. It is in this context that this research 26 is located: focusing as it does on the interaction between available media representations and 27 the experiences of ordinary people in building social and family lives. 28 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) people have been historically 29 marginalised through the censorship of representation and the use of legislation to restrict the 30 circulation of images and narratives of the legitimacy of non-heterosexual identity. In the UK 31 for example, until 2003 Section 28 prohibited local authorities from “intentionally 32 promot[ing] homosexuality or publish[ing] material with the intention of promoting 33 homosexuality” and from “teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of 34 homosexuality as a pretended family relationship” (Local Government Act 1988: chapter 9, 35 section 28). A book for children which represented a child with two gay fathers, Jenny lives 36 with Eric and Martin (1983), was decried as the tipping point of increasing circulation of 37 media which both represented and legitimated lesbian and gay relationships and was a key 38 prompt for the introduction of this legislation (Robinson, 2007, p.171). Both LGBTQ people 39 and their families were deemed an unsuitable topic for children to encounter. The availability 40 of media representations remains strongly tied to the politicised project of constituting and 41 publicly articulating stable identities for LGBTQ people (Dyer, 1990, p.286; Gross, 2001; 42 Muñoz, 1999). Examining LGBTQ people’s relationships to and use of media, therefore 43 offers a productive way to make sense of their experiences of constituting, sharing, and 44 Responses to representational invisibility  transforming family identities in a socio-political context which recently refused the 45 legitimacy of such work. This project of transformation and narrative making is strongly tied 46 to cultural representation (Driver, 2007; Hall, 1996; Gomillion and Giuliano, 2011).  47 In a media-saturated culture, representation offers a way to locate ourselves in the 48 social world (Silverstone, 2007) and a route by which we might stake a claim in social 49 discourses and the process meaning-making. Representation, whether through restriction or 50 diversification, generates different possibilities in people’s lives. This article asks what 51 possibilities of identity-narrative production and recognition in culture are created or 52 foreclosed for LGBTQ parents and their families. 53 The representation of LGBTQ-parented families 54 Visibility for LGBTQ parents’ identities and families has been increasing for more 55 than two decades (Clark, 1995; Doty and Gove, 1997; Gross, 1994; Shugart, 2003), however, 56 the meanings and uses of the available representations are less clear-cut (Phelan, 1993; 57 Walters, 2012). Walters (2012) has described the current trend in LGBTQ representation as 58 one of “banal inclusion normalisation, assimilation, everyday unremarkable queerness but 59 also, of course, continued abjection” (p.918). Whilst LGBTQ people may be able to find 60 increasing number of images which ostensibly represent them, the diversity of lives and 61 identities which are depicted is limited. Further, representational visibility has increased 62 unevenly for the different identities under the LGBTQ banner (Barker et al, 2008; Dyer, 63 2002b; Clark, 1995; Gross, 1994; Halberstam, 2005; Weeks, 1977).  64 In this context of changing visibility and representational prominence, the experiences 65 of LGBTQ people who parent and collaboratively produce narratives of family identity out of 66 available cultural resources, remain underexamined. In particular, existing research does not 67 indicate how LGBTQ parents locate their families within a media culture which does not 68 Responses to representational invisibility  equally represent the identities of those people involved in parenting, or routinely 69 acknowledge the validity of non-heterosexual family arrangements. 70 This article offers a way to understand the ongoing work of LGBTQ parents, who are 71 embedded in a media culture, as they shape and stabilise non-heterosexual family narratives. 72 This research aims to illuminate how the heterogeneous experience of family is revealed and 73 validated within what participants described in 2013/2014 as a narrow representational 74 context. To achieve this, I explore the available meanings and narratives offered in the 75 contemporary media productions which directly address, or allow scope for storytelling by, 76 LGBTQ parents. Using data from qualitative interviews, I detail the experiences of LGBTQ 77 parents in finding themselves in media, and report their work to produce and stabilise 78 narratives which affirm family validity, and recognise their family diversity.  79 Methods 80 Participants 81 This article draws on qualitative data collected during in-person, semi-structured 82 interviews with 30 LGBTQ parents, which were conducted during 2013 and 2014. The 83 participant criteria sought the following: people who were over 18, self-identify as lesbian, 84 gay, bisexual, pansexual, intersex, trans, genderqueer, non-binary, or queer, and a parent 85 living in the UK.  Participant recruitment was restricted to those living in the UK given the 86 culturally specific nature of media representation and reception (Silverstone, 2007). 87 Participants were recruited through LGBTQ studies mailing lists, community organisations, 88 community radio, personal networks, and Twitter. 89 Despite a flexible approach to recruitment, with a combination of snowball and 90 purposive sampling, the sample referred to here is largely homogenous. Only eight 91 participants described their class in another way than middle-class and all participants, except 92 one, described themselves as white. Participant ages ranged from 26-56 years and included 93 Responses to representational invisibility  British, Welsh, Scottish, Irish, European and American people, all of whom were living in 94 Scotland or England at the time of our interview.  Children of participants ranged in age from 95 5 months to 27 years old. Six participants identified as gay, 7 as bisexual, 12 as lesbian, 1 96 used the terms both lesbian and queer, and 4 identified as queer, non-heterosexual, or 97 “heterosexual with a bisexual past” (Sarah). The sample included 4 participants who 98 described themselves as poly (or ‘polyamorous’, see Sheff, 2014), and 4 participants who 99 identified themselves as trans. 100 The sample was not representative, nor was it intended to be.  There is sparse data on 101 the number of people in the UK with non-heterosexual identities and even less on how many 102 of those people parent. This study, therefore does not represent all LGBTQ people, or even all 103 LGBTQ parents; achieving this, Weston (1997) has explained, is impossible for a “population 104 [which] is not only partially hidden or closeted but also lacks consensus as to the criteria for 105 membership” (p.9). Rather, this study is a glimpse at the lives, experiences, and media 106 interactions of a given group of people who are diverse in some respects (age, location, 107 nationality, life experience) and homogenous in others (race, class). 108 The interview and analysis 109 Interviews were conducted in person and there were no restrictions on how many 110 people could take part in each interview; a number of participants chose to be interviewed 111 with their partner. In total I conducted 7 ‘couple’ interviews with 14 people (including one 112 participant’s non-parent heterosexual partner, whose responses are not included here), and 17 113 individual interviews. Conducting interviews with two people present provided an 114 opportunity for “insights into the practice of knowledge production” within these families 115 (Cameron, 2005, p.117) as participants jointly explored their perspectives on their family and 116 its place in a wider social context.  117 Responses to representational invisibility  Participants were interviewed in a range of locations. Sin (2003) has noted that being 118 able to receive researchers in one’s home indicates a degree of economic and social capital 119 and insisting on this location may therefore exclude some from participation. Participants 120 were therefore invited to select a space which they felt most comfortable in.  Those 121 participants with young children most frequently chose to be interviewed at home as they 122 could attend to childcare whilst we spoke. In all, 12 interviews were conducted in 123 participant’s homes, 7 in café-bars or coffee shops, 3 in workplaces, 1 in a hotel, and 1 in a 124 community centre.  Interviews lasted between 45 minutes, and 2 hours 30 minutes. 125 Interviews were semi-structured with a small set of core questions regarding family 126 narrative (who is in your family? What story about your family do you invite your children to 127 tell?), media usage (what media do you like and dislike? What media represents families like 128 yours?), and how decisions about family narratives were made (have you used any parenting 129 guides or resources? How did you make decisions about what to call the adults who parent in 130 your family?).  Participants were briefed that ‘media’ could encompass a broad range of 131 sources from broadcast, to community and online productions; television; film; radio; books; 132 magazines; blogs; music; or anything else they felt constituted ‘media’. Demographic data 133 was collected verbally, at the end of interviews. 134 Interviews were audio recorded on a digital Dictaphone, stored electronically on a 135 secure hard drive under randomly assigned pseudonyms, and later transcribed verbatim. At 136 the point of transcription identifying information, such as detail on workplaces and schools 137 were removed, and names of family members and pets were replaced with pseudonyms.  138 All interviews were coded in Nvivo. Nvivo allows data to be coded at multiple top-139 level ‘nodes’ representing key themes and further coded to sub-category ‘nodes’ within each 140 theme.  Informed by a discourse analysis approach to identifying significant content, those 141 topics or issues which were repeatedly commented on, or those which were discussed at 142 Responses to representational invisibility  length in multiple interviews were designated as having “worth and validity” (Waitt, 2005, 143 p.182) and formed ‘top level’ nodes. Repetitions of prominent phrases, ideas, and meanings 144 in the data were noted and used to establish which themes were most significant within the 145 data (Hannam, 2002; Smith, 1995). This article deals with the two most prominent themes: 146 lack of representation and feelings of invisibility.   147 The media examples discussed here were all identified by participants.  These named 148 texts were given both in response to questions which directed participants to list their 149 favourite and least favourite media, and in more wide ranging discussions on the type of 150 representation which participants found useful or valuable. Once identified from the 151 interview data, each text was viewed multiple times to identify particularly salient features of 152 the content, with reference to the key characteristics which participants suggested it 153 contained.  In subsequent viewings, I reflected on how these features contributed to the 154 overall narrative or discursive meaning of the text (Riggs, 2014, p.160). Analysis of the 155 meanings and discourses available in the media texts is offered here in order to situate 156 participant responses to representation, and to facilitate reflection on the role these texts 157 played in shaping and supporting the narratives participants offered of their families (Kress, 158 1996; Thompson, 1988, pp.12-13).  159 Language 160 This work aims to acknowledge and represent the complex and multi-faceted 161 experiences of LGBTQ parents in the UK today. With this in mind, I note that the available 162 language to describe relationships tends toward a division of couples into either 163 ‘heterosexual’ or ‘same-sex’ pairings. These terms both collapse gender and sex, and allow 164 no room to acknowledge non-heterosexual identities of individuals in different gender 165 couples. Additionally, same-sex is increasingly used interchangeably with ‘gay’ or 166 ‘homosexual’ (see Bingham, 2014, for example) and this risks erasing the non-binary, 167 Responses to representational invisibility  multiple, and non-homosexual attractions of bisexual, queer, and non-heterosexual parents 168 who are in same-sex or same-gender relationships. In the interests of clarity, I chose to refer 169 to couples who are in relationships with someone who describes their gender in the same way 170 as them, as being a ‘homogendered’ couple; and to describe couples whose gender identities 171 are different as a ‘heterogendered’ couple.  172 Finally, I note that I did not ask participants if they were cisgender but I did actively 173 recruit trans participants. Cisgender describes people whose gender identity is the same as the 174 one they were assigned at birth. It forms a counterpoint to transgender, which describes 175 people whose gender identity differs from the one they were assigned at birth. In order to 176 most accurately represent individuals’ identities, I use trans and cisgender only in relation to 177 participants who explicitly described themselves with reference to those terms. 178 Findings 179 The two key themes which I will explore mirror the findings of previous research on LGBTQ 180 people’s responses to media representation (Barker et al, 2008; Halberstam, 2005; Pallotta-181 Chiarolli and Lubowitz, 2003). Namely that certain identities remain proportionally 182 underrepresented in mainstream cultural images (theme 1) and that this representational 183 homogeneity results in feelings of cultural and social invisibility (theme 2).  These two 184 themes offer an insight into the prompts and challenges LGBTQ parents experience in 185 producing culturally intelligible family narratives in the media landscape of 2013/2014.  186 Theme 1: Limited representations in mainstream media sources 187 Participants felt strongly that there was a limited scope of representation for LGBTQ-188 headed families in the contemporary media landscape.  They had forceful criticism for the 189 different ways they felt representations which ostensibly addressed people like them, failed to 190 equally validate or represent their experiences.  191 Responses to representational invisibility  The ‘anti-lesbian thing’: Good gay men and the refusal to acknowledge the value 192 of lesbian parenting.  In response to prompts to tell me about the media they enjoyed as a 193 family and media which they felt represented families like theirs, over half of all the 194 participants I spoke with identified American sitcom, Modern Family. Modern Family, which 195 first aired in 2009, follows the lives of 3 generations of the Pritchett family living across three 196 households. Presented in a ‘mocumentary’ style, it includes a gay couple – Mitchell and 197 Cameron – who parent their adopted daughter Lily. 198 Modern Family was commonly watched collectively by a participant’s whole family 199 and was deemed by participants to contain broadly positive representations of non-200 heterosexual parents. However, participants were not uncritical of the way in which this 201 representation was constructed. Darren, a father to two children, whom he co-parented with 202 his ex-partner and two lesbian women said: 203 there’s an anti-lesbian thing sometimes [in Modern Family], which I think is 204 uncomfortable for me, when I’m watching with the kids. Sometimes it feels like – 205 their Mums are lesbians – so I think interestingly in a supposedly inclusive [show], 206 actually what gets marginalised is lesbian parenthood and lesbians as a group.” 207 (Darren, gay man) 208 To understand the context of Darren’s stated discomfort, it is useful to examine the 209 themes present in the sole Modern Family episode to prominently feature lesbian characters: 210 ‘Schooled’ (Levitan and O’Shannon, 2012). In the episode, gay couple Cam and Mitchell are 211 called into their daughter Lily’s school to meet with the principal after Lily fought with 212 Connor, the son of lesbian couple, Pam and Susan. The moment Cam and Mitchell discover 213 that Connor’s parents are lesbians their demeanour immediately changes; they exclaim in 214 horror “lesbians!” Pam and Susan are portrayed as aggressive through their explosive 215 entrance, their confrontational introduction (Pam exclaims: “whoever made our son cry has 216 Responses to representational invisibility  messed with the wrong Moms!”) and signalled as non-feminine by their utilitarian style of 217 dress. In their antagonistic exchange with these women, Cam and Mitchell go on to imply 218 that Pam and Susan, like all lesbians, are incapable of maintaining a welcoming home 219 (Levitan and O’Shannon, 2012).  220 Whilst Modern Family is a comedy, and Cam and Mitchell’s disdain for lesbians is 221 dramatized as an opportunity for comedic conflict, the meanings of such representation which 222 insists on an antagonistic and oppositional relationship between lesbians and gay men 223 exceeds the boundaries of the show, as Darren’s uneasiness attested. Although Modern 224 Family broadly offers celebration and legitimation of gay men parenting (Cavalcante, 2015), 225 it does this by marginalising and abjecting lesbians and gay women who take on the same 226 roles. In the confessional-style segment to camera in the ’Schooled' episode, Cam and 227 Mitchell explain their aversion to lesbians; characterising them as fundamentally estranged 228 from gay men because of both their gender, and their sexual desire for women. As gay men 229 (or sexual outsiders) parenting, Cam and Mitchell are potentially threatening to the dominant 230 order but, through the resignification of lesbians as the “constitutive outside”, the show 231 consolidates the mainstream inclusion of, and the (presumed heterosexual) audience’s 232 identification with, gay men (Hall, 1996). Cam and Mitchell’s description of their ‘natural’ 233 solidarities with heterosexual women and straight men offers the audience an assurance that 234 accepting gay male parents does not mean all the structures of hetero-patriarchal power must 235 be undone (Rothmann, 2013, p. 68. Rich, 1980). Indeed, through the assurance of their 236 fraternity with straight men and women, Cam and Mitchell’s non-heterosexuality is 237 constituted as benign and their style of parenting is ‘normalised’ by their expression of 238 distance from the “uncontainable” lesbian mothers (Riggs, 2011, p.298). Gay men are 239 positioned as allies of patriarchy, champions of heteronormativity (Shugart, 2003), whilst 240 lesbians’ capacity to parent well is dismissed off-hand. This representation therefore offered 241 Responses to representational invisibility  an implicit denial of the parenting arrangement which Darren had with his children’s mothers 242 and rendered his family unimaginable within the representational language of the show. 243 Femmes only: Invisibility of gender non-conforming women. In addition to 244 participants arguing that gay men parenting are preferentially represented (as in Modern 245 Family), a number of the lesbian, bi and queer women interviewed also suggested there were 246 further gendered inequalities in the media representations they referred to. 247 Ivy spoke passionately about the type of femininity on show when women were 248 represented in the media. Speaking about the advertising choices made by a buggy 249 manufacturer, she expressed her frustration at what she felt was an implicit denial by the 250 company that their advertised products could appeal to her, a non-heterosexual women with 251 little interest in traditional femininity: 252 I was quite irritated by Phil and Teds […] because Phil and Ted’s pushchairs actually 253 appeal to lesbians, they are off-road pushchairs, you can go hiking, and they’re 254 missing a fucking trick! […] they’ve marketed to gay men. Gay men parenting are 255 much more of a minority than lesbian parents and I think lesbian parents still get 256 marginalised in that way and they get kind of forgotten about […] I don’t know if I 257 feel represented myself […] if they’d done an ad with a lesbian couple going hiking, 258 with a Phil and Ted’s pushchair, I’d have been like ‘hey! That’s me!’ because that’s 259 why I got that fucking pushchair, not because I want to go hiking, but because it 260 appeals to me. I’m not prissy and I like functional. (Ivy, lesbian woman) 261 Ivy described a desire to see both lesbians, and non-traditional femininities represented in 262 buggy advertising, and for the buggy to be sold for the qualities she valued in it; that it is a 263 functional, robust tool to fit her active and practical lifestyle.  264 In the advertising for Phil and Teds which Ivy referred to, immaculately turned out, 265 femme women in urban environments jump for joy, with lipsticked-smiles, as they push their 266 Responses to representational invisibility  buggies in colour-coordinated outfits. Similarly slick, groomed men in fashionable outfits 267 dote on children sitting in buggies dubbed ‘travel systems’ which come in colours such as 268 ‘noir’ and ‘graphite’ (see Phil and Teds, 2017). These glamourous bodies engage with stylish 269 products which promise effortless, luxury childcare; offering a link from “off-road” and 270 “functional” buggies to a lifestyle which “transcends the banalities of femininity” (Skeggs, 271 1997, p.111) and the mundane tasks associated with childcare and motherhood. By contrast, 272 the practical and ‘functional’ marketing Ivy wished for, would serve to reinforce bodily 273 labour. Butch or non-femme bodies that may visually indicate lesbian subjectivity (in a way 274 these images of hyper-femme women and metrosexual men do not) are thus associated with 275 toil and cannot be deployed to signal aspirational lifestyles and products. Ivy was explicit in 276 arguing that this representational inequality in images of women and lesbians parenting 277 needed to change: “there’s an awful lot of butch lesbians having kids and they are beautiful 278 people too, I think that [representational invisibility] needs to be redressed really.” (Ivy, 279 lesbian woman).  280 Other women also commented on the way in which they felt media only offered 281 representations of women who conformed to traditional femininities. Talking about what she 282 felt this meant for trans women’s cultural visibility, Sarah said: 283 Paris [Lees – a trans woman, activist, and journalist] is young and beautiful and 284 consequently he [sic] can get on to television whereas I couldn’t, and there are many 285 far more prominent trans women than me in Britain who also would never be on 286 television because they’re not good looking enough. (Sarah, trans woman) 287 Available representations of both trans and cis women in mainstream media are 288 defined by narratives and images which affirm traditional femininity as ideal, and restrict the 289 possibility of increasing cultural visibility of and knowledge about women who do not fit this 290 model. This has particular significance for non-heterosexual women who parent, who may 291 Responses to representational invisibility  only find mainstream representation if their gender performance conforms to these narrow 292 possibilities; something both Ivy and Sarah expressed in their comments.  293 The two-parent model: The disappearing of co-parents and lone-parents. Moving 294 beyond evaluation of the differences in the way in which lesbians are represented compared 295 to gay men parenting, participants also offered reflections on which models of family 296 arrangement were privileged in representations. A lack of representations of families beyond 297 the two-parent model, which acknowledge co-parenting arrangements, was a frequent point 298 of discussion.  299 Seb was a step-parent to two children and was in a homogendered relationship with 300 the children’s father, who in turn co-parented with a lesbian couple. He reflected on the 301 images and narratives of LGBTQ family which had dominated news media during the 302 campaign for civil partnerships: 303 to gain that equality there almost had to be a lot of [representation about] the 304 significance of a civil partnerships […] but I think one of the secondary effects of that 305 is that it’s almost narrowed the idea of family down to couples. Which in a way kind 306 of, it can be about, but then you try to expand on that or do something that’s leftfield 307 of that, or a bit different and there isn’t any visibility of that […] it’s quite 308 deterministic now whereas if you go back before that, the idea of LGBT families […] 309 felt like it could be a bit more creative.” (Seb, gay man) 310 Seb lamented how these dominant narratives on the arrangement of LGBTQ families limited 311 the possibility to imagine different ways to arrange parenting and queer relationships. But he 312 also went on, in common with other parents I spoke with, to highlight how such 313 representations prevented him from achieving recognition and comprehension for the non-314 dyadic parenting arrangements of his family:  315 Responses to representational invisibility  People really struggle to understand the set up because there isn’t any point of 316 reference for it. [I have to tell them that] co-parenting isn’t to do with sexual 317 relationships, that it isn’t to do with previous relationships, isn’t to do with people 318 being infertile, isn’t to do with adopting, there isn’t much representation of that or any 319 points of reference for that. (Seb, gay man) 320 Lynne was a lone parent who had conceived through self-insemination and initially 321 co-parented with a male heterosexual friend. Like Seb, Lynne reported that disbelief and 322 misunderstanding were common when her daughter, Zoë, attempted to tell people the story of 323 her family: “She sometimes finds it difficult when people don’t quite get it – I think their 324 assumption is ‘have you got this quite right Zoë?’” (Lynne, bisexual woman).  325 Lynne described how she had put a great deal of energy into seeking out media which 326 represented parents and families like hers, in order to make herself and her family 327 “recognizable” subjects (Butler, 2004). Despite this undertaking, she found that the majority 328 of resources for LGBTQ parented families presented parenting dyads. Books including King 329 and King (2002), If I Had 100 Mummies (2007), And Tango Makes Three (2005), and 330 Mommy, Mama and Me (2009) were widely cited by participants as offering representations 331 of ‘families like ours’ for their children, but these texts continued to privilege a two parent 332 model. Such dyadic images offered little help for parents like Seb and Lynne who sought 333 material to support their narratives of family, and make the arrangement of their families 334 comprehensible to the people they and their children encountered.  335 Theme 2: Feeling invisible in culture and society  336 Participants were united in their belief that the various representational restrictions 337 and narrow range of cultural narratives available resulted in feelings of invisibility. In 338 addition to a lack of diversity in media images, they detailed how their individual 339 circumstances and identities complicated the potential to be identified as non-heterosexual, 340 Responses to representational invisibility  and limited the possibility of finding representations to identify with. Mary and Paul, a 341 heterogendered couple, spoke about how their poly identities inflected their sense of 342 invisibility. Paul described his perception of how his family was misread: \"when we're just 343 out and about with just [son] James [it] looks like a straight, monogamous, het[erosexual] 344 relationship, you know?\" (Paul, bisexual man). Similarly, Charlie, a bisexual woman in a 345 heterogendered, poly relationship, lamented that “pregnancy and childbirth and so on are 346 horribly heteronormative” and concluded that such ‘heteronormative’ associations 347 compounded “the normal bisexual problem, which is of invisibility” (Charlie, bisexual 348 woman). Participants suggested that their apparent conformity to heterosexual models of 349 parenting and families meant their non-heterosexual identities were “invisibilised” (Pallotta-350 Chiarolli and Lubowitz, 2003 p.56). The parents I spoke to said that a lack of cultural 351 supports by which they might be known and recognised made this invisibility difficult to 352 challenge or change.  353 Julia, a lone parent to one daughter, suggested that for her such cultural support would 354 transform her interactions with other, heterosexual, parents at her daughter’s playgroup:  355 I feel like [having] someone to identify with – [being able to say:] ‘yeah that’s pretty 356 much how it is for me’ – you know, would make me feel a bit less ‘the only one’ at 357 the playgroup, as the only person that doesn’t fit into the norm. (Julia, queer woman) 358 Julia’s wish for people “to identify with” echoes Valentine’s (1993) summary of the 359 strategies employed by lesbians in heterosexual environments, who “consciously seek out 360 other gay people…to affirm their own identity and right to be there” (p. 244).  361 There were two key elements which resulted from this sense of needing to resolve 362 feelings of cultural invisibility in order to “affirm their…right to be there” (Valentine, 1993: 363 244) which are explored in detail below. Firstly, there was a sense of pressure on, and 364 instability in family narratives. Secondly, participants appeared to feel prompted to generate 365 Responses to representational invisibility  creative responses to media representation in order to heal or mitigate this sense of pressure 366 or instability. 367 Pressures of invisibility: Difficulties sustaining non-heterosexual family 368 narratives at home. Jelena and Hannah were a homogendered couple. Hannah had one 369 daughter with a gay male friend, George, when she was single. After beginning her 370 relationship with Jelena, Hannah had a second daughter, again with George as father. Hannah 371 and Jelena co-parented both girls with George. George was also in a homogendered 372 relationship, although his partner was not involved in parenting decisions. Jelena and Hannah 373 told me about the occasionally painful interactions Jelena had with their daughters, Lexi and 374 Becca, who indicated an ambivalence about Jelena’s role in the family: 375 Jelena: They’ve got the Sylvanians, the little [animal toy] families. When they were 376 playing one day they said ‘oh that’s a Mum, that’s a Dad’ I said ‘where is the Jelena 377 then?’ 378 Hannah: Their games are still quite mummy-daddy-baby. 379 Jelena: But I’ve had that conversation with them both and they try, they say ‘ok, well this 380 is a Jelena’ and sometimes they say ‘we do! Sometimes we do play Mummy and Jelena’ 381 and I say ‘no. Not often enough!’ […] again I got upset sometimes and Lexi had done 382 some drawings ‘there’s Mummy, there’s Daddy, and me and my sister gone on holiday’ I 383 said ‘how often has that been the case? Never. There is either just Mummy and Daddy 384 and Joe [Daddy’s partner], or two of you, or all of us’ […] so again, it’s a bit personal. 385 Hannah: It doesn’t get much more personal than that. How you are seen by your kids, 386 how you are valued within the family, it’s highly, highly emotive.  387 (Hannah and Jelena, lesbian women) 388 Responses to representational invisibility  The dominance of the nuclear family narrative within mainstream media provided a source of 389 resistance to the narrative of family which Jelena and Hannah offer, and this is indicated in 390 the preferred model the girls reproduced in their play. Lexi and Becca had reshaped their 391 experience to fit a heterosexual mould. In Lexi and Becca’s play, the biological father was 392 reoriented in the centre of their family, replacing the space and role which Jelena would have 393 taken and, as Hannah presented it, generating a highly charged emotional exchange in which 394 Jelena had to push the girls to reinvest her in their family. Whilst parents can offer different 395 family narratives, the narrative of the heterosexual nuclear family was so culturally 396 significant (Nelson, 2006, p.16) that it repeatedly reasserted itself within the homes of these 397 non-heterosexual families. 398 Talking family through media: Finding ways to locate families in culture. It is 399 notable that parents explicitly stated that feeling invisible, and experiencing significant 400 emotional pressures in narrating family, as above, were not new or unexpected experiences. 401 When I asked if a sense of invisibility weighed heavily upon her and her partner, Ivy said: “I 402 think feeling alienated is just a way of life for most gay people. It’s just something you 403 become very used to, you don’t really even realise it.” (Ivy, lesbian woman). I suggest this 404 expectation or feeling that it is “a way of life” is indicative of a “border existence,” where 405 subjects do not comfortably or neatly fit into existing categories (Pallotta-Chiarolli and 406 Lubowitz, 2003: 74). Pallotta-Chiarolli and Lubowitz (2003) suggested that experiencing 407 such alienation and marginal subjectivity does, however, “open up space for 408 experimentation” (p.74). The parents I spoke to responded to emotional pressure and 409 alienation by experimenting with [re]reading representation, placing their families in dialogue 410 with different types of media images, and attempting to establish a place in the cultural 411 imaginary. 412 Responses to representational invisibility  Lynne described how she prompted and pushed her daughter to consider identities 413 which were not visible: 414 you could have a story book about a single parent and they might be bisexual but it’s 415 not stated. I think I would sometimes say those sort of things to Zoë […] things like 416 ‘that person, who knows? They might be bisexual, they might have a trans history, we 417 don’t know do we?’ It’s not explicit but it might be in there. So sometimes books 418 were – probably it’s not been in the author’s mind – but I would put it in there. 419 (Lynne, bisexual woman) 420 In this way, the specific representational needs of Lynne’s family could be drawn from pre-421 existing representational resources. Her practice of prompting and questioning functioned on 422 two levels, both highlighting to her daughter the invisibility of certain identities, and 423 emphasising the sameness of their family to these narratives by inserting identities like hers 424 into the gaps in the text.  425 Other parents cited texts including Lilo and Stitch (Spencer, 2002) (a film which tells 426 the story of Lilo, her adult sister Nani, and their journey to forming a new family with an 427 alien named Stitch, after their parents die), and The Gruffalo’s Child (Donaldson and 428 Scheffler, 2005) (a picture book which narrates the adventures of the apparently lone-parent 429 Gruffalo and his son) as resources which allowed space for this type of reading. These 430 parents sought to draw parallels between these culturally legitimated, but flexible images (see 431 Jenkins, 2006), and their unique family arrangements and values. 432 For Mary and Paul, a heterogendered couple who had poly relationships, texts which 433 offered flexible representations of gender, reproduction, and family provided a foundation for 434 building their narrative of family. The Clangers was a popular choice for both them and son 435 James. They spoke to me about the episode ‘The Egg’ (Postgate, 1970). In it, the Clangers, a 436 diminutive mouse-like race who live on a small moon, rally around their friend the Soup 437 Responses to representational invisibility  Dragon to help create a Baby Soup Dragon and ensure she is “no longer the only Soup 438 Dragon in the universe” (Postgate, 1970). In our interview, Mary spoke about a lesbian friend 439 she had supported through pregnancy and birth, and continued to support as a lone parent. 440 Mary also had another partner, Matthew, who lived with her and Paul. Mary clarified that 441 whilst Matthew did not take on a parenting role towards James, he did support her and Paul in 442 caring for their child. The multiple and flexible relations which constituted Mary and Paul’s 443 family, and their friends’ families, found representation in The Clangers, which cheerfully 444 narrated a community-centred family analogous to the one which James was being raised in. 445 Like Susan Driver’s (2007) ‘queer girls’, Mary and Paul’s reading of this popular text offers 446 the possibility of meaning-making which is “convoluted” and multiple (Driver, 2007, p.13). 447 Engaging with The Clangers in their family-activities therefore helped open space for family 448 identity to be constituted through unclear and obtuse narratives of formation; something 449 which corresponded with Mary and Paul’s stated wish to model expanded notions of family, 450 relationship arrangements, and families of choice. 451 Some parents I spoke to narrated their similarity to images that relied on more 452 traditional parenting-dyads, I suggest this is a strategy for achieving recognition and stability 453 for their family stories. Martha and Paige, a homogendered couple, who co-parented with a 454 homogendered male couple, described their response to children’s books which limited 455 images to two-parent families: 456 I realised that anything we read, most books obviously have Mommy and Daddy but 457 she has Mommies and Daddies so it’s actually not a problem, um, I mean the book 458 we’re talking about, the page says ‘some kids have two mommies and some have two 459 daddies’ and I always say to her ‘and you have two mommies and two daddies!’ 460 (Paige, lesbian woman, participant’s emphasis) 461 Responses to representational invisibility  However, for Lynne and some other parents this approach did not fully address their wish for 462 easy recognition of their identities and the intentionally chosen shape of their families. By 463 using images of family which rely on the idea that non-heterosexual family-difference is 464 identifiable exclusively through cues of homogendered relationships (“some kids have two 465 mommies”), parents unwittingly reinforced to their children a notion that families can be 466 easily categorised into ‘heterosexual’ or ‘same-sex’, and that identities do not expand beyond 467 what can be signalled by a romantic-dyadic relationship. Poaching from media which is so 468 heavily tied to dominant binary heterosexual or same-gender couple narratives of family can 469 mean that parents are no closer to making their bisexual or non-monosexual identities visible. 470 Reflecting on this, Lynne said: 471 It’s not all about same-sex relationships, it’s not [even] just about relationships, how 472 do you show images of people who are single and bisexual? You take a picture of me, 473 who would know? So I think it’s really hard to find and depict visually. (Lynne, 474 bisexual woman) 475 Participant’s comments indicated that they felt strategies of representation which 476 visually signal inclusion of non-heterosexual parents would always fail to fully represent 477 some parents. Within this context, the work many participants reported doing to mitigate 478 representational restrictions and invisibility of their family, was of limited success. 479 Discussion 480 The LGBTQ parents who participated in this study felt that the scope of media and 481 cultural images which represented non-heterosexual families was severely limited. This lack 482 of representational diversity generated discomfort and frustration for parents.  Returning to 483 Darren, who identified Modern Family’s portrayal of lesbians as ‘uncomfortable’, it is 484 possible to see how even comedic representations can have wide reaching impacts on the 485 experience of family and the possibility to celebrate and affirm LGBTQ people’s suitability 486 Responses to representational invisibility  and desirability as parents. Representation can thus enact a symbolic violence on LGBTQ 487 people denying validation and recognition of life patterns through the use of specific types of 488 characterisation (Gross 1994, p.143). In the case of Modern Family, it was not only lesbians 489 who were marginalised by this representation, but also any GBTQ person who shared a 490 connection with lesbian women. 491 Similarly, Ivy and Sarah’s comments about their feelings of cultural invisibility as 492 women who perform non-traditional femininities, pointed to a degree of representational 493 invisibility which amounts to symbolic annihilation of butch women in mainstream media 494 (Gross, 1994, p.143).  For these women, and the various parents whose families expanded 495 beyond a two-parent model, representational invisibility placed them in “nonplaces [sic] 496 where recognition…proves precarious if not elusive, in spite of one’s best efforts to be a 497 subject in some recognizable sense” (Butler, 2004, p.108). 498 These findings are in contrast to various studies which cautiously point to an 499 expansion of the “lexicon of legitimation” (Butler, 2004, p.108) and cultural normalisation of 500 families headed by LGBTQ parents (GLAAD, 2015; Schacher, Auerbach & Silverstein, 501 2005; Walters, 2012; Warner, 1999). This study indicates the importance of continued 502 scrutiny for the emergence of new hierarchies of insider/outsider, preferred/other in cultural 503 representations.  As Seb argued in his comments, the debate accompanying the changes in 504 UK law to allow same-sex marriage in 2013 (Marriage [Same Sex Couples] Act 2013) offer 505 one example of the way in which the arrangement of a two-parent non-heterosexual family 506 may be concretized both in the cultural imaginary and in legislation.  507 Even whilst media “limits what can be said” about any identity, it also “makes saying 508 possible” (Dyer, 1990, p.1). Without mainstream cultural narratives of non-heterosexual 509 families which affirm and represent family heterogeneity, the possibility of speaking about 510 Responses to representational invisibility  these families, and accessing legislative change which recognises and protects different types 511 of family, is significantly restricted.   512 The lack of media representations depicting diverse non-heterosexual families 513 generated emotional stress. Meanings which circulated in media spilled out into homes and 514 the interactions these parents had with their children, as Jelena and Hannah’s comments 515 detailed. Participants in this study reported investing an enormous amount of ongoing 516 emotional energy to help resolve the resulting cultural invisibility and alleviate symbolic 517 annihilation. This was significant as it was in addition to any work they had done to stabilise 518 their individual identities as non-heterosexual people. They worked to orientate their children 519 within their family, and to locate their families within a media culture that did not offer 520 significant recognition for either multi-parent or non-heterosexual families. Participants’ 521 work illuminates two key elements of contemporary life within a media saturated culture.  522 Firstly, it points to the impossibility of stepping outside of representation (Abel, 2007). 523 Instead, LGBTQ parents must commit to transforming representations and finding spaces in 524 the cultural lexicon, through which they can enable recognition and validation for families 525 like theirs. Secondly, it evidences the central role of media in producing ourselves as social 526 and cultural subjects, and the active participation with, and critique of media which subjects 527 must maintain, and expand, when negotiating new collective identities.  528 This second point was well illustrated by both Lynne’s, and Mary and Paul’s family 529 media-engagement and practices of narrative making. They offered their children examples 530 of how to find alternative, evolving, and open-ended narratives of family within mainstream 531 and conventional representations, but also modelled how to respond to representation. These 532 parents employ skills honed as LGBTQ youths in a heteronormative culture – the skills of 533 queer reading (Driver, 2007; Liming, 2007) – to reclaim and repurpose the content of 534 representations in support of collective, family identities. Parents’ knowledge of the potential 535 Responses to representational invisibility  of queer[ed] practices of reading to help [re]locate them in a heterosexist culture is leveraged 536 as a strategy which can be used by their whole family to respond to, and redeploy, the narrow 537 media representations which they saw. As families, they worked reflexively and discursively 538 with mainstream media representations to achieve meaningful identification, and to signal to 539 their children the culturally-validated location of their families.  540 Passing on the skills of critical queer reading is part of the everyday maintenance and 541 production of these families and marks them as a formation distinct from the rigidly 542 structured, authorised, images of family which circulate in culture. Teaching, repeating, and 543 reinforcing these critical responses is an integral part of what these families mean. LGBTQ-544 headed families are reflexive, participatory, and continuously created and stabilised through 545 discursive practices. The reflexive discourses of LGBTQ-led families contrasts with 546 traditional, dyadic, nuclear family identity-building which, although still involving reflexive 547 narrative practices, draws on a much narrower range of meanings and sources, and can 548 comfortably be legitimated through pre-established discourses. 549 Conclusion 550  This study has highlighted the significant degree to which the representations that 551 circulate through the mainstream media and cultural productions of the UK shape the 552 experiences of non-heterosexual families. Whilst participants agreed there were an increasing 553 number of images and representations of non-heterosexual family, they repeatedly 554 highlighted the lack of diversity in these images. When the messages and meanings of these 555 images were set against participants’ individual family-identity narratives there was a 556 disjuncture between the types of family arrangements which were represented and culturally-557 known, and their lived experience of forming family as LGBTQ people. In particular, 558 participants repeatedly attributed feelings of cultural invisibility, ongoing social-dislocation 559 or exclusion, and experiences of family conflict to this representational lack. 560 Responses to representational invisibility   Attempts by these LGBTQ parents to heal representational invisibility through 561 strategies of queer reading and creative use of mainstream media texts were of limited 562 success. Participants who had co-parenting arrangements, non-dyadic romantic relationships, 563 and non-monosexual identities continued to report feelings of cultural invisibility and 564 lamented the ongoing emotional labour required from them to alleviate the associated 565 pressures. 566  For future research, this study points to the importance of acknowledging identities 567 beyond gay men and lesbians in research on non-heterosexual lives. Exploring connections 568 between groups under the LGBTQ banner is especially instructive when considering the way 569 representation facilitates different family narratives even as lesbian and gay subjectivities are 570 increasingly represented by mainstream media. Secondly, responses of participants to media 571 representations indicated that media not only contributes to the ordering of everyday life 572 (Silverstone, 2007) but is also central in [dis]allowing the production of [stabilising] family 573 narratives.  Media which offers diverse representations of social groups, and represents these 574 various subjectivities as equally valuable and legitimate, are urgently needed.  Such 575 representations facilitate LGBTQ people to speak their experiences and families, open 576 dialogue with their children about family identity, and provide a foundation on which 577 narratives of location and connection can be built, ultimately providing families with a sense 578 of fitting or being ‘in place’. 579 References 580 Abel, M.

    "abstract": "This article draws on qualitative research data collected in semi-structured interviews conducted during 2013 and 2014 with 30 lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer (LGBTQ) parents living in England and Scotland. It explores how LGBTQ parents respond to media representations of families like theirs, and build narratives of family identity from limited cultural resources. Media, encompassing a range of cultural representational resources, including advertisements, television, books and films, produces specific knowledges about LGBTQ families. Participants argued that popular entertainment media (including Modern Family) offered a limited range of representations of LGBTQ parents and concretizes knowledge about the shape of families. I argue that available representations fail to acknowledge the diversity of non-heterosexual family forms and that this representational gap results in socio-cultural invisibility. I explore the responses LGBTQ parents had to such gaps and how they negotiated, or rejected representational meanings in order to consolidate new narratives of family",
