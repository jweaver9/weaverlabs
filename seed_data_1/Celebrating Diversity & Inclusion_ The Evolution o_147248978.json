Living in a world that denies you the freedom to express your \ngender identities in nonviolent ways is a burden I can never fully understand. We cisgenders \nhave it easy, since we internalize our own biases of gender into forceful means of morality and \nstigma. Playing an important role in online strategy and social media with the Human Rights \nCampaign in the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, I have personally experienced the struggles and \nsuccesses of the LGBTQ community in 2015, as well as what it means to be an activist. What is \npossible depends on what we believe is possible, and the Internet has a lot to do with that. I now \ninvite you to read the rest of my thesis, either in chapters or in its entirety.  \n3 \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nI apologize in advance for failing to personally acknowledge every single person that has \npositively impacted my life, but I thank you all nonetheless for supporting me both personally \nand professionally. I would especially like to thank my immediate family and close friends for \nsupporting me in my transition as queer to the LGBTQ community. I would also like to \nespecially thank the University Writing Center (UWC) here at Texas A&M University—College \nStation for guiding me in becoming a better writer. I was able to make mistakes and learn from \nthem so that I could continue to grow as both a writer and a person. Now, it is with great \nappreciation that I recognize certain faculty members at Texas A&M University—College \nStation that have had a direct impact on the educational value of my thesis, including Dr. April \nKinkead, Dr. Margaret Ezell, and Dr. Shari Kendall. To Dr. April Kinkead, thank you for \nencouraging me to try different things. Rhetoric had always interested me, but it wasn’t until I \ntook your Rhetoric of Style class that I was able to express my voice in unique ways that \nculminated in a challenging multimedia project that I was able to spearhead from the ground up. \nTo Dr. Margaret Ezell, thank you for acting as a sounding board for my papers. I learned how to \nuse two minds, instead of one, in order to achieve my goals. And finally, to Dr. Shari Kendall, \nthank you for serving as my thesis advisor. Indeed, you took a chance on me and my fluid ideas \nwhen I approached you out of the blue in April 2015. When you accepted the request to be my \nthesis advisor, I just knew I couldn’t let you down! I hope that my contribution really gets people \nthinking about embracing PGPs through the interconnectedness between language, people, and \nthe Internet.  \n \n4 \n \nNOMENCLATURE \n \nLGBTQ Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer \nMTF  Male-to-Female (describing Transgender Women) \nFTM  Female-to-Male (describing Transgender Men) \nPGP  Preferred Gender Pronoun \n5 \n \nCHAPTER I \nINTRODUCTION \n \nIntroduction \nWhen the Supreme Court of the United States guaranteed the right to marry for same-sex couples \nin Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015, the issue of integrating the LGBTQ community into \nsociety was propelled into the national spotlight. While many same-sex partners, many of whom \nidentify as cisgender (those who identify with the sex they were assigned at birth), are able to  \nenjoy the tangible and psychological benefits of the ruling, the transgender and genderqueer \ncommunities continue to wait on a Supreme Court ruling in which they are able to celebrate with \nas much fervor.  \n \nIn his descriptions of microaggressions, Nadal explains how discrimination can manifest itself in \nsubtle ways through language. One important stepping stone for achieving equality for the \ntransgender and genderqueer communities is Preferred Gender Pronouns (PGPs), including \ngender-neutral pronouns and pronoun introductions. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary \nto educate society about pronoun usage and to convince them to embrace pronoun introductions. \nTherefore, this thesis will present an analysis of xxxx on college websites to assess how effective \nthese sites are in educating students and others about gender-neutral pronoun usage and pronoun \nintroductions.  \n \nIn the remainder of this chapter, I describe Nadal’s eight microaggressions and provide an \noutline for the thesis.  After describing my methodology in Chapter II, subsequent chapters \n6 \n \ndiscuss the histories and challenges of integrating gender-neutral pronouns into the English \nvernacular, explore the physical and virtual spaces in which gender-neutral pronouns are used, \nespecially as introductions; examine Internet slang in virtual spaces in order to suggest the \nInternet as a medium of linguistic transformation that can affect physical spaces as well; and \npresent an analysis of LGBT-inclusivity by looking at data collected from college websites.  \n \nMicroaggressions \nIt is first important to understand the main challenges that the LGBTQ community faces. In a \nsociety that favors the majority over the minority, many obstacles present themselves for the \nminority constituency. For example, many minority groups are often excluded from social circles \nbecause of differences in speaking, dressing, and even being. In the case of LGBTQ \ncommunities, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression serve as stigmas that \nprevent non-LGBTQ communities from fully appreciating intersectionality, or the intersecting \nsocial identities and related systems of oppression, domination or discrimination. In fact, many \npeople within the LGBTQ community already face scrutiny and disregard for how they are \nsituated to the world. These offenses are what Kevin Nadal describes as “microaggressions.” \n \nMicroaggressions help us understand how discrimination can manifest itself in subtle ways. \nOften times, microaggressions occur in commonplace settings, like school and work; the catch is \nthat we often don’t notice that we’re discriminating because of our assumptions of what the \nLGBT experience is about. In Nadal’s book, That’s So Gay: Microaggressions and the Lesbian, \nGay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community, he discusses the literature on discrimination and \nmicroaggressions toward the LGBT community, outlining several ways in which people \n7 \n \nlinguistically discriminate against LGBT people. Nadal’s theoretical taxonomy1 on sexual \norientation and gender identity microaggressions “cited eight distinct categories of \nmicroaggressions that may target LGBT people” (Nadal 46). Furthermore, Nadal discusses each \nof the eight categories of microaggressions in two chapters, both of which discuss all eight \nmicroaggressions; however, he divides the chapters as such to discuss the unique circumstances \nthat Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual people face versus those that Transgender people face. While \nNadal recognizes the distinct experiences between gender identity and sexual orientation, \namalgamating lesbians, gays, and bisexuals into one category can also be problematic in terms of \nwhat one considers to be the lesbian experience, the gay experience, or the bisexual experience; \nhowever, for the purposes of discussion, I will explain them as they are dichotomized by Nadal. \nEach theme will first present an overview of the microagression. Then, each will explain two \nexamples from the LGB community and one example from the Transgender community \nrespectively.2 \n \n1. Use of heterosexist or transphobic terminology \n                                                 \n1 Nadal provides the following disclaimer in the construction of his taxonomy: “We were consciously aware that we \ndid not have any transgender people on this task force and that all three of us identified as cisgender. We also \nrecognized that we did not represent a completely diverse group of racial and ethnic backgrounds because each of us \nwas either Latino or Filipina/o. Thus, we consulted with our personal and professional networks—which included \ntransgender people (both male-to-female, or MTF, transgender people and female-to-male, or FTM, transgender \npeople), other LGBT people of color, LGBT White Americans, bisexuals, and others—to create a comprehensive \nlist of microaggressions experienced by LGBT people” (Nadal 46). \n2 Because Nadal does not use three distinct examples to provide lesbians, gays, and bisexuals a proper lens for their \nunique situations, I will not be able to examine each microaggression as it relates to the every situation that the LGB \ncommunity faces. However, one can use the other communities’ experiences and apply the ideas to one’s own \nsituation. \n8 \n \nThis first theme is “characterized by experiences in which LGB people are called derogatory \nnames or teased with cruel words. It also includes heterosexist remarks that are made directly to, \nor around, the LGB individual. Sometimes such language is used intentionally to berate or offend \nan LGB person; at other times people may not even realize they are using homophobic language \nbecause it is part of their everyday speech” (Nadal 54).  \n \n1.1. “That’s so gay” [LGB] \nNadal uses the example of Vince Vaughn using the phrase, “that’s so gay,” in the movie, The \nDilemma. Consequently, Vince Vaughn received criticisms for his remarks, but he did not send a \nformal apology to the LGBT community because he denied any intention of insulting gay people \n(Read 10 – Nadal 55). While Vaughn did not initially go out of the way to offend the LGBT \ncommunity, this instance speaks largely of the misunderstanding between society and the LGBT \ncommunity, like the misuse of the word “fag” or “dyke,” since it often reflects biases of LGB \npeople as “bad, weak, or inferior” (Nadal 55). \n \n1.2. “Faggy” [LGB] \nNadal’s next example references the heterosexist language used by Kurt against Finn in the hit \ntelevision show, Glee (Murphy, Falchuk, & Brennan 2010 – Nadal 55). It is important to note \nthat Kurt is a heterosexual, cisgender man and Finn is a homosexual, cisgender man. Finn \nproceeds to make remarks about the Kurt’s redecoration as “faggy.” After being called out on his \nlanguage by his father, Finn contends that he was using the word, “faggy,” to describe Kurt’s \nblanket, not Kurt himself. However, Kurt’s use of the word, “faggy,” is still heterosexist, even if \n9 \n \nit was unintentional, since the word has different associations for the LGBT community in \ncontrast to the non-LGBT community. \n \n1.3. “Shemale” [Transgender] \nNadal recounts the experience of one transgender woman: “I was walking one time to the post \noffice and I had just recently had my lips done and a little five-year-old kid said, ‘Daddy, daddy. \nHey daddy, that’s a shemale.’ So he never referred to me as a man. He referred to me as . . . a \nshemale (Nadal, Skolnik et al., 2012, p. 65)” (Nadal 85). In this instance, the transgender \nwoman, though we know little about her operational status (whether she is a transsexual), incurs \nshaming from even a young child. The text suggests that the transgender woman was \ncomfortable being referred to as a man, rather than what seems like both a man and a woman. \n \n2. Endorsement of heteronormative or gender normative culture and behaviors \nThis second type of microaggression “occurs when one conveys a message that heterosexuality \nis normal while homosexuality or bisexuality is abnormal, wrong, or unnatural” (Nadal 57). \n \n2.1. “Normal” [LGB] \nOn The Microaggressions Project blog, Nadal discussed the example of a slide that normalized \nheterosexism. The creator of the PowerPoint was actually presenting at a suicide prevention \nworkshop at a college campus, when the following text appeared on a slide: “LGBT people are \nsix times more likely to attempt suicide than normal people” (Nadal 57). Although the slide \nattempts to be LGBT-inclusive, it really marginalizes the LGBT community because they are \ncompared to “normal” people, which suggests that the LGBT community is “abnormal.” \n10 \n \n \n2.2. “Proper” [LGB] \nThe second example refers to instances in the movie, But I’m a Cheerleader. In the movie, \nteenage boys and girls, suspected of being homosexual, are sent to a camp in order to be taught \nthe “proper” way of acting as heterosexuals (Peterson & Babbit, 1999 – Nadal 57). Much like the \nprevious example, the use of the word “proper” suggests that homosexuality is “improper.” \n \n2.3. “My son isn’t putting on dresses!” [Transgender] \nThe example given refers to an episode on ABC’s The View in 2007, in which one of the co- \nhosts, Sherri Shepherd, bursts out: “Not in my house! Not in my house! Not in my house! My \nson isn’t putting on dresses! Girls wear dresses! When he’s 18, he can do what he wants, but not \nin my house!” (Nadal 87). Besides the repetitive declarations of authority, Shepherd is actually \nencouraging transgender people to remain with their genders assigned at birth. \n \n3. Assumption of universal LGBT experience \nThis third category occurs “when one assumes that all LGB individuals are the same. One way \nthat this may manifest is through the presumption that all lesbians have identical experiences, all \ngay men have identical experiences, or all bisexuals have identical experiences” (Nadal 60). \n \n3.1. “Come on, you’re gay! You can’t play football!” [LGB] \nThis statement was made by someone popular on the football team. After approaching a friend \nabout trying out for the football team, the victim received the following response: “Come on, \nyou’re gay! You can’t play football” (Nadal 60). The person on the football team assumes that \n11 \n \nall gay men like feminine activities and that football is masculine. This suggests there are certain \ngender roles that people should fulfill based on their sexual orientation and biological sex. \n \n3.2. “[Bisexual people] will have sex with anyone who is available to them” [LGB] \nThis example is cited as a stereotype from gays, lesbians, and heterosexuals. The following \nstereotype was brought to light by a bisexual woman, the author of Bi Lives: Bisexual Women \nTell Their Stories: “[Bisexual people] will have sex with anyone who is available to them” \n(Nadal 60). Not only does the stereotype assume a universal experience for bisexuals, but it also \ncharacterizes bisexuals as promiscuous. \n \n3.3. “against God’s will” [Transgender] \nOften it is assumed that LGBT people could not possibly be religious or spiritual because they \nare “choosing” something that others believe to be “against God’s will.” In the movie \nTransamerica, one of the characters, Toby, alludes to “the notion that transgender people could \nnot be Christian. In response, Bree (the protagonist) replies, “My body may be a work-in-\nprogress, but there is nothing wrong with my soul,” thus affirming that “transgender people are \njust as moral and good as anyone else” (Nadal 90). \n \n4. Exoticization \nThe fourth topic is “evident when LGB individuals are viewed as a form of entertainment or \nobjectified because of their sexual orientation or identity” (Nadal 61). \n \n4.1. “[you’re living a] fantastic and fabulous [lifestyle]” [LGB] \n12 \n \nIn Nadal’s studies, one gay male discussed the discomfort that he experienced from being \nobjectified as a fantasy projection. Friends in his life assumed “[you’re living a] fantastic and \nfabulous [lifestyle]” if you’re gay (Nadal 62). What this suggests is two-fold: a universal \nexperience for gay people and objectification for being gay. The former was discussed in the \nprevious section, but the latter perpetuates a dehumanization of gay people. \n \n4.2. “I’m more wary of being objectified by men than by women” [LGB] \nIn Nadal’s reference to Bi Lives, many participants presented frustrations with the way many \npeople, especially heterosexual men, see bisexual women as sexual objects. In fact, one \nparticipant confessed that “I’m more wary of being objectified by men than by women” (Nadal \n62). Thus, bisexual women face the constant pressure to conform to the idea that they are a form \nof entertainment for people, particularly for heterosexual men. \n \n4.3. “tokens” [Transgender] \nTransgender people may be “viewed as ‘tokens’ : token girlfriends, token boyfriends, or even \ntoken friends.” As one participant reported, “Even if they don’t even like you, just because \nyou’re a tranny, they want you in their collection” (Nadal 91). \n \n5. Discomfort with/disapproval of LGBT experience \nFifth is the microaggression that “consists of instances in which a heterosexual person, whether \naware or unaware, shows her or his displeasure of or apprehension toward nonheterosexual \npeople” (Nadal 63). \n \n13 \n \n5.1. “Save Our Children” [LGB] \nIn the 1970s, Anita Bryant created a Christian group called “Save Our Children” to combat gay \nrights laws; in fact, she “publically campaigned against any state legislation that protected the \nrights of gay and lesbian people, stating that LGB people were immoral and would corrupt or \nabuse children” (Nadal 63). \n \n5.2. “Whoa” [LGB] \nOne lesbian participant from Nadal’s studies experienced disapproval from passengers on a train \nfrom her girlfriend kissing her. This type of disapproval stemmed from a shocked face, which the \nparticipant describes as kind of like “Whoa” (Nadal 63). \n \n5.3. “Hi [said avoidantly]” [Transgender] \nNadal explains that avoidant behaviors may demonstrate discomfort or lack of acceptance even \nwithout hurtful or discriminatory language. One participant described this experience: \nI was in school and was getting to know this gentleman. I didn’t feel comfortable \nin telling him that I was transgender because I wasn’t too sure how I [felt] with \nhim yet. There was this girl in my class who I had thought she knew I was \ntransgender because we go to the gym together. She tried to question my gender \nand she [also] found out I was talking to that gentleman. One day, \nI happened to walk down the same block as he was and he moved to the left and I \nkept moving forward. He waved ‘hi’ but it was like he was ashamed, like I was a \ndisease. I was definitely hurt. In the end, I found out she told him that I was a \nman. (Nadal 92)” (92). \n14 \n \n \n6. Denial of the reality of heterosexism or transphobia \nThe sixth microaggression occurs when “individuals deny the occurrence of heterosexism; \nsometimes this can occur when someone denies that she or he is homophobic, whereas at other \ntimes people can deny that heterosexism exists at all. For example, when LGB people confront \nperpetrators on their microaggressive behavior, the perpetrator can sometimes react defensively \nand assert that his or her intention was not to be offensive. Some LGB people may appreciate an \nexplanation, but others may believe that the individual is merely creating excuses instead of \nadmitting fault” (Nadal 68). \n \n6.1. “No, no, I was saying you’re funny, and you’re cute, and you dress nice” [LGB] \nAnother participant from Nadal’s studies, a gay male, received a comment from a woman one \nnight about his looks and likened him to the character, Jack, from Will and Grace. The \nparticipant responded, “Ma’am, no offense, but that’s actually not a compliment,” to which the \nwoman contended, “No, no, I was saying you’re funny, and you’re cute and you dress nice” \n(Nadal 69). Instead of apologizing for offending or stereotyping him, the woman exacerbated the \nsituation. In this instance, the woman did not recognize her own biases towards gay men. \n \n6.2. “Oh, it’s usually his fault” [LGB] \nBecause many marginalized groups, such as LGB people do not report discrimination out of fear \nfor how others react, LGB people can continue to be discriminated against. For example, Lisa \nRivero, the mother of a gay son, reached out to school officials about other children bullying her \n15 \n \nchild. However, school officials have dismissed her son’s problem as “oh, it’s usually his fault” \n(Nadal 69). \n \n6.3. “You should really be more tolerant of people who don’t get it” [Transgender] \n“‘I don’t know why you’re so upset about this. You should really be more tolerant of people who \ndon’t get it.’ This type of statement can be invalidating to the transgender person who \nexperiences such bias and discrimination on a regular basis. A cisgender person does not know \nwhat it is like to be transgender; neither does she or he know what transphobic discrimination \nfeels like. Thus, when invalidating a trans person’s experiences, cisgender people communicate \nthat trans people’s perceptions are unworthy or irrational” (Nadal 95).  \n \n7. Assumption of sexual pathology/abnormality \nThis seventh theme pertains to a microaggression that is evident when “heterosexuals believe \nthat LGB individuals are sexually promiscuous or sexually deviant. Sometimes these can take the \nform of comments and statements that are meant to be hurtful and demeaning” (Nadal 66). \n \n7.1. “AIDS Kills Fags” [LGB] \n“When Christian fundamentalist protestors hold up signs at LGB events, like ‘AIDS Kills Fags,’ \nit is clear that they are intending to offend the LGB people who see them or hear them” (Nadal \n66).   \n \n7.2. “Oh, since you’re bisexual and you might try to come on to me” [LGB] \n16 \n \nOne bisexual study participant shared that she lost some friends because of her sexuality, stating \nsomething along the lines of, “Oh, since you’re bisexual and you might try to come on to me” \n(qtd. in Nadal 68). This stereotype—that a lesbian or bisexual woman would automatically hit on \nor sexually assault a heterosexual person—implies a bias that LGB women do not have any \ncontrol of their sexual urges or desires, but it also is insulting because it suggests that these \nwomen would be attracted to any other woman, regardless of physical attractiveness level, \npersonality, or other characteristics” (Nadal 68). \n \n7.3. “I touched that person!” [Transgender] \n“Another transgender woman shared an encounter in which an emergency medical technician \n(EMT) accidentally came in contact with her blood: ‘She said, ‘I have kids, I can’t believe this. \nOh my God. I touched that person! I touched that person’s blood. I touched that person’s blood’” \n(qtd. in Nadal 94). Although this EMT encounters blood on a regular basis, her strongly negative \nreaction to this transgendered woman’s blood “may exemplify her bias toward transgender \npeople or her specific stereotype that transgender people would have HIV/AIDS” (Nadal 94).  \n \n8. Denial of individual heterosexism \nThe eighth and final theme alludes to microaggressions that occur through the various \ninstitutions that are created by society. \n \n8.1. “[Schools]” [LGB] \nNadal includes one student’s comment about physical affection in schools:  \n17 \n \nI remember I had a guy friend—he kissed another guy, he just kissed a guy and \nthey gave him detention, they would give detention at any moment like doing \nanything with the person of the same sex and then they would say, “You know, \nyou should keep that to yourself because parents will complain, students will \ncomplain” and I’m like “Why would they complain[,] it’s not like I’m doing \nanything to them” and they’re like, “No, it’s wrong, you shouldn’t do it because it \nmakes other people uncomfortable.” It actually bothered me because why can’t I \nbe myself, you know, it shouldn’t be a problem. If other people can have \nboyfriends you know . . . really promiscuous people making out in the hallway, \nyou’re trying to get to class and . . . they just keep doing whatever they’re doing \non the lockers and everything but if I was to hold hands with my girlfriend it \nwould be like “What are you doing?” (qtd. in Nadal 71) \n \n8.2. “[Government]” [LGB] \nMicroaggressions also occur within the military:  \nI was in the Army and they have the . . . “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” rule. Well, \nyou’re there and you feel like freakin’ terrified if anybody found out that you \nwere that way. So that really pissed me the hell off. So, I just kind of kept to \nmyself, you know. I mean, if at some point I develop a close knit relationship with \none of my battle buddies, then I’m pretty much need to shut up and keep your \nmouth like this [gesture of zipping lip] and just don’t let it get out there (qtd. in \nNadal 71). \n \n18 \n \n8.3. “[Public Restrooms]” [Transgender] \nOne transgender male participant shared this dilemma: “When I use the bathroom, I tend to \nwithdraw and use the handicap bathroom. People are always looking at me like . . . \nTheir perception of me is like ‘Just use the male bathroom.’ And I’m thinking . . . do I wanna \nengage with my male co-workers who might freak out? Or if I want to use the women’s \nbathroom . . . what that brings up for women and seeing my presence in there” (qtd. in Nadal 98).  \n \nDescription of the chapters \nBecause these microaggressions are rooted in power and privilege, I recommend an approach to \nequalizing the distribution of power by extending privileges to the LGBT community. One such \nway is by adopting pronoun introductions, which are the gender pronouns people prefer to be \ncalled by and established when introducing themselves. For example, a transgender woman may \nintroduce her pronouns as she/her/hers despite being biologically male. While this may shock \nsome people, pronoun introductions are used in order to create safe spaces for those who don’t \nfeel that the labels society gives them are adequate.  \n \nUsed almost exclusively by the LGBT community in the past century, pronoun introductions are \nnow becoming increasingly used and accepted. However, the merits of pronoun introductions are \ncriticized largely on the grounds that they are impractical in the sense that language doesn’t \nchange overnight. It takes years for new words to enter into the English vernacular; furthermore, \nit takes even longer to introduce new pronouns—take, for example, the longstanding history of \nthe perpetually sexist ‘he’ pronoun. In order to understand this concept, I will provide a review \n19 \n \nof the history of gendered pronouns and gender-neutral pronouns in Chapter III: A Survey of \nEnglish Pronouns, the Internet, and Spaces.  \n \nNext, it will also be useful to discuss a couple of other Internet dialects of English. Due to the \noverwhelming popularity of Internet phenomena, such as cat memes and communication \nbetween video-gamers, discussing two of Internet’s most popular dialects will provide a good \nfoundation for understanding the capacity of digital spaces to create change. Therefore, I will \ndiscuss LOLSpeak and LeetSpeak in Chapter III: A Survey of English Pronouns, the Internet, \nand Spaces.  \n \nAfter these two sections, it will be easier to evaluate the effectiveness of using pronoun \nintroductions in digital spaces. Since physical spaces and digital spaces are simply different \nenvironments where communication takes place, examples will be discussed in order to ensure \nan effective understanding of the similarities and differences between them. Ultimately, \nhowever, I stress the importance of utilizing digital spaces to create change in physical spaces. \nThese topics will be discussed in Chapter III: A Survey of English Pronouns, the Internet, and \nSpaces.   \n \nOnce those three chapters have been discussed, it is necessary to analyze the data I collected in \nChapter IV: Analysis.  \n \n20 \n \nCHAPTER II \nMETHODOLOGY \n \nFor my research, I collected data from thirty schools’ LGBT or diversity resource pages on the \ntopic of pronoun introductions in order to identify trends on various aspects of Preferred Gender \nPronouns (PGPs). Specifically, I am interested in how rhetorically effective these pages are in \ncommunicating the concept to users. Thus, I designed five questions to score universities from a \nscale of 0 to 5 and each question being worth 0 or 1 point. They are as follows: \n \n1) Importance: “Did the page explain how PGPs help genderqueer and transgender communities \nfeel comfortable?”  \n2) Pronouns Binary: “Did the page draw a distinction between gendered pronouns and non-\ngendered pronouns?”  \n3) Examples: “Did the page provide examples of gendered pronouns, non-gendered pronouns, or \nboth?”  \n4) Misgendering: “Did the page explain what to do if you or someone else ascribed the wrong \ngender pronoun to an individual, otherwise known as ‘misgendering?’” \n5) More Information: “Did the page provide further information about getting involved or \nshowing support for pronoun introductions, whether it be providing a link to the school’s LGBT \nresource center website or a downloadable PDF resource from nonprofit organization working to \nachieve this end?”  \n \n21 \n \nDrawing from Kevin Nadal’s Microaggressions and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and \nTransgender Community, I approached the creation for these questions with the end goal for \nusers to create change in digital spaces and physical spaces. What I mean by change is affecting \nsociety by increasing support for PGPs and fostering more gender-fluid, LGBT-inclusive spaces \n \nRationale for question 1: Any resource promoting a culture’s customs needs to explain why it \nexists; therefore, this question serves to imbue the user with a sense of motivation for \nunderstanding genderqueer and transgenderqueer communities.  \nRationale for question 2: In discussing PGPs, it is necessary for users to understand the \ndifference between gendered pronouns and non-gendered pronouns. Doing so will reduce \nconfusion as to why some people identify with a certain gender, thus validating the experience \nfor everyone. If people understand the differences between gendered pronouns and non-gendered \npronouns, then they will be more likely to recognize how people want to identify, thereby \nmitigating the oppression of gender-strict roles.  \nRationale for question 3: In learning a new concept, it helps to have examples. Recognizing what \nthey look like in text is helpful for recognizing them when they are actually used, whether in \nphysical spaces or digital spaces.  \nRationale for question 4: People make mistakes; that’s why it’s important to encourage growth \nand mitigate stigma. Simply explaining what to do in a misgendering situation will help users \nbecome accustomed to using PGPs as a sign of respect and help those reading about such \nsituations recognize when they need to ask about PGPs.  \n22 \n \nRationale for question 5: Because information about a concept does not necessarily put it into \npractice, it is necessary to provide further information for people to get involved. This way, the \nlearning never stops, and general tolerance for PGPs will gain traction.   \n \nAs for the selection of schools in higher education, I selected thirty different colleges in the U.S \nby searching for “Preferred Gender Pronouns Colleges” as keywords in Google’s Search Engine. \nI selected the first sixteen Public Universities, the first seven Liberal Arts Colleges, and the first \nseven Private Universities that provided information about PGPs.  \n \nAll the websites and their contents were accessed on Friday, January 15, 2016. Schools may have \nchanged the content of their websites after this date. The list of schools and the URLs that I used \nto access each website appear in Appendix A. Some URLs lead to separate pages on PGPs, \nwhereas others lead to pages that provide information about PGPs within the schools’ online \nLGBT Resource Centers. \n \nI hypothesize, first, that Private Universities and Liberal Arts Colleges would have higher overall \nscores than Public Universities, since Private Universities and Liberal Arts Colleges generally \npay more attention to students’ learning and well-being. Second, I also expect that all three \ncategories would do well in two questions: Question 1) Importance: “Did the page explain how \nPGPs help genderqueer and transgender communities feel comfortable?” and Question 3) \nExamples: “Did the page provide examples of gendered pronouns, non-gendered pronouns, or \nboth?” This is because significance and examples are common sense in the U.S. If you want to \n23 \n \nprove a point, explain your position and why it matters to your audience; then, provide and \nelaborate on examples to further your argument.   \n \nThird, since Public Universities have generally large student populations and promote a “system-\nlike” approach to interacting with students, I feel that scores will be relatively lower than their \ncounterparts, due largely in part to Public Universities overlooking the details of PGPs. I \nspeculate that Public Universities would want to show some sort of acknowledgement for \ntransgender and genderqueer communities, but I do not believe most will go through the effort of \nmaking PGPs something that other students should go out of their way to learn. Specifically, I \nfeel that Public Universities wouldn’t focus as much on Question 2) Pronouns Binary: “Did the \npage draw a distinction between gendered pronouns and non-gendered pronouns?”;  Question 4) \nMisgendering: “Did the page explain what to do if you or someone else ascribed the wrong \ngender pronoun to an individual, otherwise known as ‘misgendering?’”; and Question 5) More \nInformation: “Did the page provide further information about getting involved or showing \nsupport for pronoun introductions, whether it be providing a link to the school’s LGBT resource \ncenter website or a downloadable PDF resource from a nonprofit organization working to \nachieve this end?” This is because there isn’t really an incentive for Public Universities to go \nabove and beyond for promoting a small subculture that is the LGBT community. I believe that \nstudents who enroll in Liberal Arts Colleges and Private Universities are more likely to have \nliberal views, which would encourage them to support the LGBT community. \n \n24 \n \nThis analysis does not necessarily comment on how diverse and inclusive the college is towards \nthe LGBTQ community; rather, it seeks to analyze the rhetorical effectiveness of each college’s \nPGPs approach.  \n \nEach answer is worth 1 point if the answer is yes, and 0 points if the answer is no to the five \nquestions. Therefore, the scores can range from 0 to 5. The higher the score, the more effectively \nPGPs should impact the immediate communities in creating a more diverse and inclusive \nenvironment for transgender and genderqueer communities.  \n25 \n \nCHAPTER III \nA SURVEY OF ENGLISH PRONOUNS, THE INTERNET, AND SPACES \n \nIntroduction \nThe Internet plays a large role in shaping language. The dissemination of information allows \nideas to gain traction quicker and deeper. While it is a place for people to become educated about \npronouns, it is also a place where people can learn to use the Internet to promote minority status \n(e.g. a transgender woman may not feel as comfortable telling people in person, but the Internet \nallows them (through video, written text, etc.) to express themselves more easily and safely). In \nthis chapter, I first explain the history and use of pronouns in the English language. Then, I \ndiscuss two examples of Internet slang: LOLSpeak and LeetSpeak.  \n \nGendered pronouns \nThe English language has become increasingly scrutinized for its bias of gender. That’s why \nmany people cite inherently biased pronoun use as a source of inequality. The source of this \ninequality stems from what scholars call “gender performativity.”: “the performance and \ninterpretation of gender identity” (Mooney 109). Mooney explains, \n[T]here are certain expectations of people according to biological sex. Very often, \nhowever, in reality people don’t always conform to those expectations. The \ngender norms in a society generate conventions that people are judged against. It \nis of course possible not to conform to these gender expectations, but there are \noften consequences for the individuals who do this.” (Mooney 109)  \n26 \n \nThus, the complex differences between masculine pronouns and female pronouns relating to the \nway they are used and how they are associated do, in fact, bear strong implications on how sexes \ntreat themselves and each other. Therefore, this section will explore the history of gendered \npronoun use in the English language in order to demonstrate how language evolves over time. \n \nThird person singular pronouns in English have been an issue for decades. Feminist linguists and \nothers brought attention to the sexism of the masculine generic during the women’s movement of \nthe 1960’s and 1970’s (e.g. Bodine; Kramer, Thorne, and Henley). According to Martyna, the \ngeneric masculine is problematic because it encourages a male rather than neutral interpretation, \nwhich excludes females (487). It may also be ambiguous and misleading. For example, a \nsociology text reported, \"The more education an individual attains, the better his occupation is \nlikely to be, and the more money he is likely to earn”; however, the statement was accurate only \nfor males (488).   \n \nLinguists and others have also examined pronoun use amongst transgendered individuals in  \nEnglish and other languages, such as Hindi (Hall); however, this topic has received much less \nattention than the masculine generic even though the selection of third person singular pronouns \nis a fundamental issue for many transgender and genderqueer individuals. In her analysis of \nfemale-to-male, or \"transmasculine,” individuals, Saltzburg identifies pronouns as playing an \nimportant role in transgendered individuals’ formation and presentation of their identities as they \ntransition from female to male, along with clothing and their choice of a personal name (72). \n \n27 \n \nAnother issue is that “each episode of LGBT victimization, such as physical or verbal \nharassment or abuse, increases the likelihood of self-harming behavior by 2.5 times on average” \n(IMPACT). Furthermore, “LGB youth are 4 times more likely, and questioning youth are 3 times \nmore likely, to attempt suicide as their straight peers” (CDC). Thus, relatively high suicide rates, \nespecially for LGB youth are another reason that PGPs deserve more attention, since they help \npromote a safe space for expression and exploration.  \n \nIn general, people should use the individual’s preferred gender pronoun (PGP).  This is a good \nidea because it validates that person’s experiences and it shows respect for difference. This is \nakin to the idea of not judging people based on their weight, age, ethnicity, and disabilities. \nBecause society gives us these labels, it often times can mold us to have a negative perception of \nourselves; therefore, by using an individual’s PGP, one can help people define themselves more \npositively.  \n \nThere are four cases that are relevant in our discussion of English pronouns, which include: \nnominative, accusative, genitive, and dative respectively. I will list examples in the conventional \norder : 1st person singular, 2nd person singular, 3rd person masculine, 3rd person feminine, 3rd \nperson neuter, 1st person plural, 2nd person plural, and 3rd person plural. \n \nThe nominative case refers to subject words; in other words, the word in the nominative case is \nthe one doing the action (e.g. I, you, he, she, it, we, you, they). In Old English, the nominatives \nwere ic, þu, he, heo, hit, we, ge, hie. As you can see in the 3rd person masculine and 3rd person \nfeminine, there is one extra letter added from the 3rd person masculine in order to create the 3rd \n28 \n \nperson feminine. Can this minute addition, which probably served a practical function in terms of \ncommunication, be attributed to sexist ideology that was perpetuated into the language? Before \nwe can find out, we should explore the other three cases.  \n \nSecond, the accusative case refers to object words.  The most common use emerges from what a \nverb confers action to. Take, for example, the sentence: We ate the food—in this instance, food \nwould be accusative. Thus, our accusative pronouns list includes: me, you, him, her, it, us, you, \nthem. In Old English, the accusatives were me, þe, hine, hie, hit, us, eow, hie.3 In contrast to the \naforementioned suspicion that adding an extra letter from the masculine form to the feminine \nform was an attempt to institute patriarchy, it does not seem so likely now that we can see that \nthe masculine form in this instance actually takes on an additional letter from the feminine form.  \n \nThe third case to be discussed is the genitive, or what we call the “possessive.” This case, as you \nmay expect, denotes possession. For example, She broke his bones, Mike’s feet smell, The girl’s \ndress was pretty, Their game was fun. The genitives in these sentences respectively follow: his, \nMike’s, girl’s, their. Therefore, genitive pronouns include: my, your, his, her, its, our, your, their. \nIn Old English, the genitives were min, þin, his, hire, his, ure, eower, hira.  \n \nThe fourth and final case to be discussed is the dative case, which generally indicates the noun to \nwhich something is given. If we assume the object of the sentence is ‘ball’, then the sentence, I \npassed the ball to Sally, makes ‘Sally’ dative; I took the ball from Sally also makes ‘Sally’ \ndative. While the dative case has other uses as well, they’re less common, and will not be \n                                                 \n3 The pronouns þec and mec were used in poetry.  \n29 \n \ndiscussed further. In Old English, dative pronouns included: me, þe, him, hire, him, us, eow, \nhim; whereas, in modern English, the datives are the same as the accusatives: me, you, him, her, \nit, us, you, them. \n \n \n Third Personal Singular Pronouns \n Nominative Accusative Genitive  \n she   her  her  \n he  him  his \n \nSome pronouns introduced for transgender and genderqueer individuals are ‘ze’ and ‘hir’. ‘Ze’ \nreplaces ‘she’ and ‘he’ and is pronounced like “zee”. It is sometimes spelled as ‘zie’ or ‘xe’. \n‘Hir’ replaces ‘her’, ‘him’, and ‘his’ and is pronounced like “here.” Another set of gender-neutral \npronouns include ‘e’, ‘em’, and ‘eir’ as nominative, accusative, and genitive respectively.  \n \n Other Suggested Forms for Third Person Singular \n Nominative Accusative Genitive  \n they  them  their  \n ze  hir  hir \n e  em  eir \n \nYou should avoid using ‘it’ or ‘he-she’ to refer to any human. \n \nAs explained by Bodine, the use of “singular ‘they’” is considered to be a new phenomenon in \n30 \n \nEnglish and has been labeled as grammatically incorrect. However, ‘they’ has been used as a \nsingular by great writers and in spoken English since the 1300s. For example, Shakespeare wrote \nin Much Ado About Nothing, “God send everyone their heart's desire!” (III.1). Grammarians \nbegan prohibiting this construction in the late nineteenth century when they created many \narbitrary prescriptive rules based on Latin, which has nothing to do with English, and without \naccurate knowledge about the structure of language (Pinker). Prescriptivists may argue that \nsingular ‘they’ doesn’t agree in number with an antecedent, but if the masculine generic is used \nwhen referring to females, it doesn’t agree in gender.  \n \nPauwels and Winter find that Australian classroom teachers are increasingly adopting gender-\ninclusive alternatives to generic ‘he’ “with a clear preference for and tolerance of singular ‘they’ \nin their own and their students’ writing” (128). \n \nThere is a great deal of resistance against the use of singular ‘they’; however, there is even more \nresistance to the introduction of new pronouns. For example, last year, University of Tennessee \nPresident Joe DiPietro removed a newsletter article advocating the use of gender neutral \npronouns such as \"ze\" for \"he\" and \"she\" from the Diversity and Inclusion's website. The issue \nwas scheduled for a senate hearing (Sher). The result was that the University of Tennessee at \nKnoxville had to reassign $8 million from the University of Tennessee budget to its extension \nschools in Martin and Chattanooga (Sher). Consequently, the University of Tennessee’s Office \nof Diversity and Inclusion already receives no federal funding, so this is a huge setback.   \n \n31 \n \nInternet slang \nThe internet has provided a space for transgendered people from disparate parts of the world to \ncome together. As web inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, observes in his biographical account, \nWeaving the Web, “The Web is more a social creation than a technical one . . . to help people \nwork together” (qtd. in Cystal). Crystal states, “The Web is no longer only a purveyor of \ninformation. It has become a communicative tool” (204).  \n \nThe internet has proven itself to be a site in which new forms of language may rapidly develop \nand take hold.  Internet slang is a primary example; I want to specifically discuss LOLSpeak and \nLeetSpeak.  \n \nWith the growth and use of the Internet in recent years, Internet slang is being increasingly \naccepted as an extension of the English language. Often, the linguistic properties of these new \nInternet trends develop in online communities; in fact, this phenomenon does not only limit itself \nto the English language: “The linguistic consequences of evolving a medium in which the whole \nworld participates – at least in principle, once their countries’ infrastructure and internal \neconomy allow them to gain access – are also bound to be far-reaching” (Crystal 5). While the \nsubject of discussion is on the English language, I just wanted to point out that it could have \nhappened with any language; however, English happened to be the primary language of users, \nand, as Crystal points out, “it is still largely in the hands of the better-off citizens of the \ndeveloped countries” (5).4  \n                                                 \n4 It is important to note that Crystal’s Language and the Internet was written in 2001, and there have been many \nchanges from then to 2015. Smart phones, for instance, have enabled people from less developed countries to utilize \nthe Internet, decreasing the percentage of users whose primary language is English. \n32 \n \n \nThe medium of the internet itself promotes language change due to the evolution of \ntechnological developments, which puts “users under constant pressure to adapt their language to \nthe demands of new contexts, and giving them fresh opportunities to interact in novel ways” \nbecause “people “adapt language to meet the needs of new situations, which is at the heart of \nlinguistic evolution (Crystal 224). One reason that new forms of language may develop is \nbecause “much of the native-speaker usage in chatgroups and virtual worlds is non-standard, \noften ludic and highly deviant…. The bending and breaking of rules… is a hallmark of ludic \nlinguistic behavior” (224).   \n \n“Language being such a sensitive index of social change, it would be surprising indeed if such a \nradically innovative phenomenon did not have a corresponding impact on the way we \ncommunicate. And so it can be argued. Language is at the heart of the Internet, for Net activity is \ninteractivity” (Crystal 237). As Naughton observes in his history of the internet, “The Net is \nreally a system which links together a vast number of computers and the people who use them” \n(qtd. in Crystal 237).  \n \n“I view each of the Netspeak situations as an area of huge potential enrichment for individual \nlanguages. The English experience… is one of remarkable diversity and creativity. There is no \nindication, in any of the areas I have examined, of Netspeak replacing or threatening already \nexisting varieties. On the contrary, the arrival of new, informal, even bizarre forms of language \nextends the range of our sensitivity to linguistic contrasts. Formal language, and other kinds of \ninformal language, are seen in a new light, by virtue of the existence of Netspeak. An analogy \n33 \n \nwith clothing helps make this point. I remember once owning a very formal shirt and another I \nused for informal occasions. Then I was given a grotesque creation that I was assured was the \nlatest cool trend in informality; and certainly, the effect was to make my previously informal \nshirt look really somewhat staid. The new shirt had not destroyed my sense of the value of a \nformal vs. informal contrast in dress behaviour; it simply extended it. I was sartorially enriched, \nwith more options available to me. I see the arrival of Netspeak as similarly enriching the range \nof communicative options available to us. And the Internet is going to record this linguistic \ndiversity more fully and accurately than was ever possible before” (Crystal 241-242).  \n \n1 LOLSpeak \nThe relationship between language malleability and the Internet is exemplified by the creation of \na new Internet slang that has emerged in the online cat-loving community: LOLSpeak. Lefler \ncharacterizes LOLSpeak as “an internet dialect of English that is used in conjunction with \nimages of cats, [and] exhibits distinctive variations and patterns which differ from those of \nstandard English” vii). Indeed, this dialect is interesting in that it serves to anthropomorphize \n(think Winnie the Pooh, Peter the Rabbit, and so on) such mischievous animals as cats. Thus, the \nhuman traits ascribed to cats, helps create the impression of intelligibility, through which humans \ncan understand and enjoy the humor.  \n \nIn order to discuss the relationship between language malleability and the Internet, it is important \nto start, “The first three letters of the word Lolspeak represent of the acronym L.O.L, for “laugh \nout loud.” Thus, the name characterizes the contents as humorous. Lolspeak began with images \n(also known as macros) of cats accompanied by text, usually referred to as captions. The cats \n34 \n \ndisplayed in this online forum are known as Lolcats, the feline creatures who use or are talked \nabout in Lolspeak, in a small section of the internet, but recognition has extended far beyond the \ninternet and into the pop culture world. The Lolcat phenomenon is interesting because of the \ninnovative language play (with the text superimposed onto the cat macros) created mostly by \nnative English speakers whose intentions, it seems, were to make amusing text for funny cat \npictures to evoke positive reactions in others. However, in the process of doing so, they also \ncreated a unique form of English, that I analyze here as a distinctive dialect of English, whose \ndevelopment shows how dialects are formed. The Lolcat phenomenon has become a full-blown \ninternet community that has sculpted the rules of this new dialect of English, and is influencing \nspoken language by its growing popularity” (Lefler 1).  \n \nLefler argues against the prescriptivist belief that “nonstandard English degrades the language \nand language skills,” citing Crystal and Baron, who “frequently mention that Netspeak, \ntextspeak, and other variations of English are positive influences on language,” and other \nresearchers (Baron “Digital Media”; Baron “Alphabet to Email”; Bolaños and Posteguillo; \nLabov) (Lefler 6). Baron’s article, “Are Digital Media Changing Language?” is “designed to \nneutralize such statements (2009:42-46). In this article, she acknowledges that digital media are \nplaying a role in changing language. She explains why this is, and how language change is a \ngood thing” (Lefler 6).  \n \n“Yet, while Lolspeak is widely recognized and available, it is important to remember there \nis a specific culture that goes along with it, as articulated by my colleague: “Even though we’re \nin a global society, we still communicate in isolated cultural communities of our choosing. We \n35 \n \nchoose to evolve language to create our own community. It’s a bonding technique, in my \nopinion” (Harrington-Burns “Cultural Anthropology” 2011).” (Lefler 59).  \n \n2 LeetSpeak \nAnother Internet slang that has become popular, especially in gaming communities, is \nLeetSpeak, or 13375p34k (in LeetSpeak terms), which originally arose from hackers. This type \nof slang uses ASCII characters in place of Latinate characters, so that the ASCII characters \nquasi-resemble what the characters should look like if it were written in the Latin script. “The \ninternet is often referred to as ―the information superhighway. Information can be spread \namong a large group of people in only a matter of seconds. This allowed the slang to be spread \nvery quickly among internet communities” (Flamand 1).  \n \nThe ability of the Internet to disseminate info can be demonstrated by “the use of Leetspeak on \nmessage boards and IRC channels, caused the slang to spread to a larger group of people. As the \noriginal purpose of the slang was to hide messages, Leetspeak is often with good reason \nconsidered to be incomprehensible by outsiders. Because of the increasing popularity of the \nslang, this group of outsiders is becoming smaller and smaller. Ironically, this could become the \nslang‘s death. Some original leetspeakers do not like the spreading of the slang, which was \nsupposed to be part of their private subculture. Other leetspeakers, however, continue to play \nwith language and keep on pushing the limits of legibility. The term ―Leet can either refer to \nthe language or the subculture. The increasing popularity of Leetspeak also caused some \nresentment among Internet users” (Flamand 19).  \n \n36 \n \nSpaces \n1 Physical safe spaces \nA “safe space” is a place where anyone is allowed to fully express themselves without the fear of \nfeeling unsafe on account of race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender \nexpression, cultural background, religious affiliation, age, or disability. Thus, “physical safe \nspaces” refer to safe spaces that are physical in nature; in other words, what we encounter in \nreality, rather than virtually via technology.5  \n \nThe exact origin of the term, “safe space,” is not unanimous; however, most attribute it to the \nwomen's movement, where it implies “a certain license to speak and act freely, form collective \nstrength, and generate strategies for resistance...a means rather than an end and not only a \nphysical space but also a space created by the coming together of women searching for \ncommunity\" (Kenney 24). The first safe spaces were gay bars and consciousness raising groups. \n \nIn 1989 Gay & Lesbian Urban Explorers (GLUE) developed a safe spaces program. During their \nevents including diversity-training sessions and antihomophobia workshops, they passed out \nmagnets with an inverted pink triangle, \"ACT UP's...symbol\", surrounded by a green circle to, \n\"symbolize universal acceptance,\" and asked, \"allies to display the magnets to show support for \ngay rights and to designate their work spaces free from homophobia\" (Raeburn 209).  \n \nOver the years, physical safe spaces have become increasingly popular and effective. At the \nUniversity of Missouri, for instance, “A drunken white student disrupts an African American \n                                                 \n5 Virtual safe spaces will be discussed in a later section of this chapter.  \n37 \n \nstudent group, the Legion of Black Collegians, preparing for homecoming activities and uses a \nracial slur when they asked him to leave.” Not only did this individual disrupt our rehearsal, but \nwe were also made victims of blatant racism in a space that we should be made to feel safe” \n(Pearson).  \n \nEven at the prestigious Yale University, there is conflict over which spaces should be kept safe \nand not transgressed: “The Yale lecturer whose email about Halloween costumes exposed long-\nsimmering racial tensions on this Ivy League campus has decided to stop teaching at the \nuniversity” (Stanley-Becker).  \n \nMany LGBT organizations and progress organizations of the like tend to promote the use of \nPGPs.  \n \n2 Virtual safe spaces \nVirtual spaces are often criticized for being echo chambers. South Park actually lampooned this \nidea of forced consensus by having Cartman sing about having a “safe space” free from \ncriticism, which inadvertently destroys a man named Reality who threatens the space.  \n \nChat rooms, like those at the TrevorProject, for example, allow anonymous users to enter a \nvirtual safe space through synchronous messaging. Online communities often create a space for \ntheir interests through media like forums and Youtube channels.  \n38 \n \nCHAPTER IV \nANALYSIS \n \nIntroduction \nIn Chapter II: Methodology, I mentioned that I wanted to collect data from LGBT resource \ncenters at institutions of higher learning to determine how well they support the transgendered \nand genderqueer communities, specifically in terms of Preferred Gender Pronouns (PGPs). Now \nthat we have gone through the chapters necessary to understand the research’s context and \nsignificance, it is now time to analyze the data and draw conclusions. I accessed each of the \nschools’ LGBT or diversity resource pages that pertain to the topic of pronouns either through a \nURL to a page devoted to PGPs or tied with schools’ LGBT Resource Centers somehow. Also, it \nis important to note that because I accessed these URLs on one given day, some of the \ninformation that was made available to me may not have been readily available to someone who \naccessed it before or after that given date. Nevertheless, the data is still useful in measuring \neffectiveness at a given point in time.  \n \nIn order to measure the effectiveness of each resource, I used five questions to evaluate the \nrhetorical effectiveness of each school’s resource. Using Boolean values of ‘0’ and ‘1’ for ‘no’ \nand ‘yes’ to the questions respectively, I summed the five inputs (each is valued at 0 or 1) in \norder to reach a score of 0 to 5 for each school. These scores represent a spectrum from not very \neffective to very effective. The questions follow:  \n \n39 \n \n1) Importance: “Did the page explain how PGPs help genderqueer and transgender communities \nfeel comfortable?”  \n2) Pronouns Binary: “Did the page draw a distinction between gendered pronouns and non-\ngendered pronouns?”  \n3) Examples: “Did the page provide examples of gendered pronouns, non-gendered pronouns, or \nboth?”  \n4) Misgendering: “Did the page explain what to do if you or someone else ascribed the wrong \ngender pronoun to an individual, otherwise known as ‘misgendering?’” \n5) More Information: “Did the page provide further information about getting involved or \nshowing support for pronoun introductions, whether it be providing a link to the school’s LGBT \nresource center website or a downloadable PDF resource from nonprofit organization working to \nachieve this end?”  \n \nIn order to reflect the diversity of school systems, my sample consists of three categories: Liberal \nArts Colleges (7), Public Universities (16), and Private Universities (7). What I expected to find \nwas that Liberal Arts Colleges and Private Universities would score higher overall than Public \nUniversities. Also, I hypothesized that all three categories of schools would score well on \nquestions 1 and 3; however, I felt that Liberal Arts Colleges and Private Universities would score \nhigher than Public Universities for questions 2, 4, and 5. \n \n40 \n \nAnalysis \n1.

In decimal form, this would translate as follows: high (0.8 –1.0), middle (0.6), \nand low (0 – 0.4). There were twelve schools that scored high (63%), nine schools that scored in \nthe middle (30%), and nine schools that scored low (30%).  \n \n1.2 Questions 1 & 3 \nQuantitatively, the averages demonstrate that questions 1 and 3 received the highest scores \n(0.667), which suggests that my hypothesis was correct that all three categories of schools \ntogether would score well on these two questions, and my reasoning could therefore be justified: \nthat U.S. institutions of higher learning stress explaining why something is important and \nsupplying that point with examples in order to communicate effectively.  \n \n1.3 Question 2 \nFor question 2, the average of 0.6 means that 3 out of every 5 schools listed distinguished \nbetween gendered pronouns and gender-neutral pronouns on their web pages. Furthermore, the \naverage of .5625 for Public Universities confirms that my hypothesis was also correct in saying \nthat there would be less of a focus on describing the differences between gendered pronouns and \ngender-neutral pronouns.  \n \n42 \n \n1.4 Question 4 \nQuestion 4 had the lowest overall average, tallying at 0.533; that’s just a little more than 1 out of \nevery 2 colleges addressing the “misgendering” dilemma.  \n \n1.5 Question 5 \nQuestion 5’s overall average was 0.633, which was the third highest overall average score among \nthe five questions. This suggests that after questions 1 and 3, question 5 was recorded the most. \nIn terms of providing more resources for users, I think that schools in general are doing a good \njob with accessibility; however, it can certainly be better, as discussed later.  \n \nAlthough only one link is necessary for receiving a point for this answer,  \nCornell University went above and beyond by listing six different sources, including: \nhttp://nonbinary.org/wiki/Gender_neutral_language and \nhttp://genderqueerid.com/post/46526429887/selected-links-on-non-binary-gender-in-japan.  \n \nOverall, there were no patterns in which one point on a question would lead to another point on a \ndifferent question except for questions 1 and 3. What this suggests is that my methodology of \nscoring schools was effective because it was comprehensive (i.e. one question wasn’t related to \nthe other question insofar as basically answering the same question).  \n \n43 \n \n2 Results by School Type \n \nTable 2: Liberal Arts Colleges by Scores Received \n \n \nIn Table 2, we see that the averages for questions 1 & 4 were higher than those in the pool of All \nUniversities: .714 compared to 0.667 for question 1 on importance, .571 compared to 0.533 for \nquestion 4 on misgendering; as a result, averages for questions 2, 3, & 5 were lower than those in \nthe pool of All Universities. Even more interesting is that the total average for Liberal Arts \nColleges is actually lower than the total average for all schools combined (0.6 vs. 0.62).  \n \nCollege Name Importance Binary Examples Misgendering More Info Totals\n*(1) Carleton Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) N N *3\n*(2) Sarah Lawrence N N N N N *0\n*(3) Grand Valley State N Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) N *3\n*(4) Middlebury Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) *5\n*(5) Williams Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) *5\n*(6) Pomona Y (+1) N N N Y (+1) *2\n*(7) Bates Y (+1) N N Y (+1) Y (+1) *3\nAverage 0.714 0.571 0.571 0.571 0.571 0.6\n44 \n \nTable 3: Public Universities by Scores Received \n \n \nIn Table 3, we find that the averages for questions 1 & 3 were higher than those in the pool of \nAll Universities; consequently, averages for questions 2, 4, & 5 were lower than those in the pool \nof All Universities. Indeed, the total averages for Public Universities is still lower than those of \nAll Universities (0.613 vs. 0.62); however, the total averages for Public Universities was higher \nthan those of Liberal Arts Colleges (0.613 v. 0.6). What this suggests it that the total averages for \nPrivate Universities should be higher than those of All Universities, since this is the last category \nleft. Furthermore, the data collected from Public Universities surprised me in that I thought \nPublic Universities would fare the worst in terms of scores. While it is significant that the total \naverages of Public Universities was higher than those of Liberal Arts Colleges, it is important to \nconsider that the averages were essentially the same at about 61% versus 60% for Public \nUniversities and Liberal Arts Colleges respectively.  \nCollege Name Significance Binary Examples Misgendering More Info Totals\n**(8) UW--Milwaukee Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) *5\n**(9) TAMU--College Station N N N N N *0\n**(10) UT--Knoxville N N N N N *0\n**(11) UNC--Chapel Hill Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) N *4\n**(12) UW--Madison Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) *5\n**(13) CCSU Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) *5\n**(14) University of Oregon Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) N N *3\n**(15) Ohio University Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) *5\n**(16) SJSU Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) N N *3\n**(17) University of Utah Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) *5\n**(18) UC--Berkeley Y (+1) N Y (+1) N Y (+1) *3\n**(19) UC--Davis N N Y (+1) N N *1\n**(20) Penn State University Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) *5\n**(21) UC--San Diego N N N N Y (+1) *1\n**(22) Michigan State Y (+1) N N Y (+1) Y (+1) *3\n**(23) University of Vermont N N N N Y (+1) *1\nAverages 0.6875 0.5625 0.6875 0.5 0.625 0.613\n45 \n \n \nTable 4: Private Universities by Scores Received \n \n \nIn Table 4, we discover that the Private University averages for questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 were \nhigher than those in the pool of All Universities; as a result, averages for question 1 were lower \nthan those in the pool of All Universities. As expected, Private Universities had higher total \naverages than those of All Universities (0.657 vs. 62). In terms of understanding why question 1 \nscored lower in Private Universities, I think that Private Universities, which are generally more \nprestigious, assume that their student bodies don’t need to be explained why PGPs are \nsignificant, since most of those student bodies are more culturally sensitive anyway.  \n \nDiscussion \nOverall, 63% of these thirty institutions of higher education received high scores for rhetorical \neffectiveness, 30% received low scores, with the other 30% in the middle. This is not to say that \nschools that received a low score (0-2) did not have other useful LGBT resources; however, their \nresources on PGPs were not very effective or useful \nAs I hypothesized, the schools as a whole were most successful in explaining how PGPs help \ngenderqueer and transgender communities feel comfortable (question 1) and providing examples \nCollege Name Significance Pronouns Binary Examples Misgendering More Info Totals\n**(24) MIT N Y (+1) Y (+1) N N *2\n**(25) Harvard N Y (+1) Y (+1) N Y (+1) *3\n**(26) American Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) N *4\n**(27) Cornell Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) *5\n**(28) Tufts N N N Y (+1) Y (+1) *2\n**(29) Vanderbilt Y (+1) Y (+1) Y (+1) N Y (+1) *4\n**(30) Northwestern Y (+1) N N Y (+1) Y (+1) *3\nAverages 0.5714 0.7143 0.7143 0.5714 0.7143 0.657\n46 \n \nof pronouns to support their explanations (question 3). The motivations they provide for using \nPGPs also warrant them including information about PGPs in the first place, so this is not too \nsurprising; and the use of examples make their explanations more effective.  \nThe University of Oregon, for example, offers the following explanation: “We offer a chance for \neveryone to state their pronouns because UO is a place of respect, and doing this is just one of \nthe ways that we try to create spaces that are welcoming and safe for all of our Ducks (or \neveryone). We try not to make any assumptions about the people that are here.” The University \nof Oregon clearly explains that PGPs help create spaces for respect. This university offers the \nfollowing examples (question 3): “What are pronouns? (He, him, his/ She, her, hers/ they, them, \ntheirs/ ze, hir, hirs/ cos, cos, cos, etc.) Why don’t we say ‘masculine pronouns’ or ‘feminine \npronouns?’ (or boy or girl pronouns?) Because it forces people into a prescribed gender identity \nthat they may not fit into.”  \n \nOnly three out of five schools (0.6) addressed the gender binary even though gender is \nfundamental to the issue of PGPs. Private Universities were most successful in addressing this \ndistinction (.7143) with Public Universities (.5625) and Liberal Arts Colleges (.571) lagging \nbehind. \n \nAs an example, Carleton College offers the following explanation about the gender binary: \n“Many other individuals, however, do not identify within the gender binary, causing traditional \nassumptions about gender to be irrelevant or incorrect.” What makes awarding this point easier is \nif the word, “binary,” is actually used; this is good because it goes a step further, rather than \nundercutting the message. \n47 \n \nI speculate that this might be the case because students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds \nare more likely to attend private universities and are also more likely to have more liberal views.  \n \nMy hypothesis was correct for question 4 about the sites including ways of handling \nmisgendering situations because Public Universities had an average of 0.5 for this question, \nwhich is lower than the overall average. This would point to the fact that Public Universities \ndon’t have to deal with these social justice issues to the point that “misgendered” students would \ndemand action to be taken to improve the gender culture.  \n \nTake, for example, American University’s explanation on “misgendering”: “If you make a \nmistake: Mistakes happen! If you use the wrong pronoun, apologize and correct it, and then \nmove on.” There was more explanation, but this is really all that is necessary to receive credit for  \nquestion 4. The important thing was to emphasize apologizing and learning from that mistake.  \n \nMost of the schools (0.633) provided ways to get more information either by providing \ninformation through, for example, links to the school’s LGBT resource center website or to \nresources from nonprofit organizations (question 5). Although I hypothesized that Public \nUniversities would fare poorest, it was the Liberal Arts Colleges who came in last with scores of \n0.625 and 0.571, respectively. Private Universities outshone the others at 0.7143 Perhaps Private \nUniversities have more of an incentive to support the transgendered community or perhaps their \nstudents are more liberal in general.  \n \n48 \n \nTypically, most schools would answer question 3 by using “he, him, his, she, her, hers” as \ngendered pronouns and “they, them, theirs, ze, hir, hirs” as gender-neutral pronouns. There was \nnot much debate over what constituted gendered pronouns; instead, many schools differed in \nwhat they put for gender-neutral pronouns outside of “they, them, theirs, ze, hir, hirs,” including \n“ey, em, eirs, xe, xem, xers.” \n \nTables 2, 3, and 4 show that Liberal Arts Colleges scored lower at (.6) than Private Universities \n(0.657) and Public Universities (0.613).This could suggest a contradiction to my hypothesis, \nwhich predicted that Liberal Arts Colleges and Private Universities would score higher than \nPublic Universities; however, the fact that Liberal Arts Colleges scored lower in total average \nthan All Universities suggests that at least one of the two other pools should have scored higher \nin total averages than the pool with All Universities. Therefore, my hypothesis was not \nsupported.  \n \nIn terms of overall progress, 70% of schools scored in the middle or high range (12 schools \nscored high and 9 schools scored middle for a total of 21 schools out of the 30 total schools). The \ndata from these thirty schools suggests that, if an LGBT resource center includes information \nabout PGPs, which means they are aware of the issue, then they are effectively communicating \nthe importance of PGPs.  \n \nQualitatively, the schools answered or did not answer the questions in the same way. Therefore, \nit was necessary for me to make evaluations as I went along. For example, I had to make a lot of \njudgments for question 5) More Information: “Did the page provide further information about \n49 \n \ngetting involved or showing support for pronoun introductions, whether it be providing a link to \nthe school’s LGBT resource center website or a downloadable PDF resource from nonprofit \norganization working to achieve this end?” What I was looking for was a digital way that pages \ndemonstrated a need for further learning. In many cases, this could be easily achieved by simply \nhaving a link to more LGBT resources. However, in some cases, a link to the school’s home \nwebsite or other non-related articles did not tell me that the school understood the importance \ncontinuing the education of inclusive genderqueer and transgender community.  \n \nIn terms of accessibility, therefore, many schools need to make their resources more user-\nfriendly. Some schools could have easily gotten a point for question 5; however, I made the \nassumption that users don’t have time to look through various pages. Instead, they prefer one \npage with content and links. One really effective way schools could have made resources more \naccessible was by having their LGBT resource centers release them to the public. This way, the \nLGBT resource center addresses would allow users to know where to inquire further. The \nUniversity of Wisconsin—Madison, for example, placed its address at the bottom left-hand \ncorner of the PGPs pamphlet online. One less effective way schools attempted to make their \ninformation accessible was by having only certain departments of the school release the \ninformation. This way is ineffective because it does not reach the whole university, as would an \nLGBT resource center; in other words, the information distributed in those classrooms is only \nexclusive to those taking the class. In fact, the University of North Carolina—Chapel Hill did \nthis by having only their Writing Center release information on PGPs. Had this school also \nreleased information on PGPs through the LGBT Resource Center, then students would be able \nto find its address and obtain more opportunities to learn. While good, the Writing Center alone \n50 \n \nwill not help students access information; the information about PGPs is limited and therefore \nfinite. Students won’t bother learning about transgender and genderqueer communities more than \nwhat they read from the Writing Center’s page. Thus, this may increase stereotypes and deter \nkeeping up with changes in PGPs and the LGBTQ community.  \n \nUpon further analysis, my study is certainly helpful in understanding quantitatively the rhetorical \neffectiveness of web pages from various school websites; however, there may been a few flaws \nin my research methodology.  \n \nFirst, my use of web pages doesn’t necessarily allow other researchers to see the same \ninformation as I. This lack of continuity speaks largely about the difficulty in analyzing \ninformation that is constantly changing (i.e. the Web). However, that is the nature of this \nmedium. \n \nSecond, my randomized sample may have been influenced by my previous queries using \nGoogle’s Search Engine. Since Google’s Search Engine algorithm is constantly changing to meet \nusers’ needs, the validity of “randomness” is called into question.  \n \nThird, my sample size of 16 for Public Universities may not have been appropriate relative to the \nsample sizes of 7 for both Liberal Arts Colleges and Private Universities. Future studies could \nconduct research with a more equitable distribution that don’t necessarily limit themselves to \ntypes of colleges, but expand to include other significant factors, such as geography, student \npopulation, and religious affiliation.  \n51 \n \n \nFourthly, the scoring aspect of my methods was highly subjective. Since, web pages are \nconstantly changing, it is important to conduct future studies with the user’s comprehension and \ncall to action in mind. Additionally, my understanding of rhetorical effectiveness is influenced \nby academia and my own perceptions of what is effective. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate \nquestions that reduce as much bias as possible.  \n52 \n \nCHAPTER V \nCONCLUSION \n \nIntroduction \nAlthough many people believe that the LGBTQ community is a homogenous group, \nintersectionality may affect the cohesion of the group: “there is discrimination between the men \nand the women, the cisgender and the transgender, the monosexuals and the bisexuals, the White \npeople and the people of color, the able-bodied and people with disabilities, the older and the \nyounger, and the list goes on” (Nadal 189). Therefore, as Nadal alludes to, the LGBTQ \ncommunity needs to recognize its individual powers and privileges in order to avoid acting as an \noppressor or microaggressor. One way to maintain cohesion is for cisgenders and transgenders \nalike to utilize pronoun introductions in order to establish respect for people’s preferred gender \npronouns, both in physical spaces and virtual spaces. Because the places where we are socialized \nare becoming increasingly diverse, it is important to keep in mind the different avenues we have \ntoday at our disposal, both physical and virtual.   \n \nWhile young LGBTQ communities today may take for granted the blood, sweat, and tears of \nprevious trailblazers, it is important to not overlook the impact that various activists have had in \nshaping the increasingly tolerant society that America is pushing towards today. In fact, Nadal \nmentions, “Because we now live in a world in which many of us have much more privilege and \nequality and in which many of us feel safe going out at night and loving whomever we choose, it \ncan be easy to be complacent” (189-190). This thesis responds to Nadal’s admonition not to be \ncomplacent by advocating for the inclusion of transgender and genderqueer communities post-\n53 \n \nObergefell v. Hodges. Because this decision was considered a victory for same-sex couples, \nmany constituents in the LGB community were able to sit on their laurels; however, the \ntransgender community is still calling out for help, and we, as the LGBTQ community, need to \nanswer the call. The power of validating a transgender person’s gender identity is often \noverlooked as a simple custom in the LGBTQ community; but in reality, the respect we show the \ntransgender community helps us foster respect for those that are different from us, many of \nwhom comprise other minority communities. If all of society were to adopt this behavior, we \nmay be able to eradicate wars, hate crimes, and other atrocities and injustices that stem from \nprejudice.  \n \nMy analysis of Preferred Gender Pronoun (PGP) resources on college websites demonstrated that \nhigher education in the United States is headed in the right direction. While the scores weren’t \nperfect, I expect that schools will begin to take PGPs more seriously in the future. This is due to \nthe increasing pressure being placed on privileged groups of creating safe spaces for minority \ngroups.  \n \nThe various multimedia channels that are emerging on the Internet are a crucial site for educating \nthe public about PGPs to aid in eliminating prejudice against the transgender and genderqueer \ncommunities. With the rapid transformation of the Internet and its applications, users are still \nincreasing in number, especially in the United States, where the population using the Internet \nincreased by 7% over the course of only one year, from 2013 to 2014. As a result, the total \nnumber of Internet users in the U.S. in 2014 totaled 279,834,232, whereas the total population \nnumbered at 322,583,006; thus, the total percentage of Americans using the Internet in 2014 hit \n54 \n \nabout 87% (“Internet Users”). That represents roughly six out of seven Americans who are using \nthe Internet, and are thereby exposed to the landscape that has the potential to fully embrace the \nidea of pronoun introductions.  \n \nRecommendations for non-LGBTQ communities \nIn this section, I build upon Nadal’s recommendations for alleviating microagressesions by \nsuggesting recommendations for how to address PGPs in the five non-LGBTQ audiences that \nNadal identifies: families, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods and communities, and \ngovernment.  \n \nFirst, families need to understand their role in promoting PGPs. “Families are where children \nfirst learn about their values and where they initially start to develop their personalities. Families \nare also where they receive their first messages about anything that is different (e.g., race, \nreligion, gender, sexual orientation), and these messages may in turn have an impact on their \nvalues and personalities” (Nadal 177). Therefore, it is important for parents to communicate with \ntheir children the complex issues of diversity and difference, especially at an early age. This \nearly childhood development is crucial in shaping the children when they become adults.  \n \nNadal also advocates for families to familiarize themselves with this subculture in order to \nmitigate fears. He states, “One last recommendation for families is to normalize the experiences \nof LGBT people. Instead of treating them as an outside group, perhaps getting to know more \nabout LGBT history, LGBT communities, and LGBT experiences can help someone to feel more \ncomfortable with LGBT people instead of viewing them as the ‘other’” (Nadal 179-180). Nadal \n55 \n \nalso draws on a study that found that “the more educated heterosexual people were and the more \nexposure they had to LGBT people (e.g., having friends who are gay and lesbian), the more \nlikely they were to be allies” (179-180). Thus, it helps to socialize with the perspective of \nlearning more about the LGBTQ community.  \n \nNadal’s comments on both the influence of parents and the normalization of LGBT experiences \nsuggest that people should be proactive in organically creating relationships with the LGBT \ncommunity in order to form a genuine view, rather than a contrived view stemming from \nexoticization in the media. It follows, then, that asking people what their PGPs are, whether they \nare part of the LGBTQ community or not, will go a long way in fostering a positive environment \nfor the LGBTQ community, especially transgender and genderqueer communities. For example, \nwhen a parent inquires a child’s friend, James—assuming James is old enough to have a working \nknowledge of PGPs—about PGPs, James is freed from the stress of conforming to gender roles, \nor is at least aware that this is an issue.  \n \nSecond, in schools, educators need to consider the “programs and pedagogies they’re teaching \nand promoting” to ensure that LGBT students feel included (Nadal 181). Drawing on Fine and \nMcClelland, Nadal observes that programs such as the federal education campaign, “Abstinence \nOnly Until Marriage,” may enforce heteronormativity when interpreted as sexuality being \nacceptable only in the context of heterosexual marriage, resulting in “heterosexual and cisgender \nstudents feeling normalized, while LGBT students learn that they are different or inferior.” These \nperceptions may lead to “heterosexist bullying and harassment that occurs in hallways and \nclassrooms” (Nadal 181).   \n56 \n \n \nNadal recommends a website called Understanding Prejudice for its helpful list of “Tips for \nElementary School Teachers” to help them “create a safe environment to promote diversity and \nminimize microaggressions” (181). His abbreviated list includes the following: \n1. Creating an inclusive environment (e.g., ensuring that classroom posters, \npictures, books, music, toys, dolls, and other materials are diverse in terms of \nrace, ethnicity, gender, age, family situations, disabilities, and so on); \n2. Integrating children’s own experiences (e.g., avoiding a ‘tourist approach’ to \nmulticulturalism that limits diversity to holidays, special events, and history \nmonths); \n3. Addressing children’s questions and concerns (e.g., directly answering \ndiversity-related questions rather than side-stepping the question or changing the \ntopic); and \n4. dealing with discriminatory behavior (e.g., explicitly stating that you will not \ntolerate racial, ethnic, religious, sexual, or other offensive jokes, slurs, or \nbehaviors, and explain why. (Nadal 181-182) \n \nThe aforementioned recommendations by Understanding Prejudice seem like they would be \neffective, but I want to address the issue of being too broad. I pose the situation where the school \nis located in a very homogenous area of town, where the whole population happens to be \ncisgender heterosexuals. The teacher who is to adopt these four principles may inadvertently not \nbe creating an authentically multicultural environment, since many students may not understand \ntheir discriminatory behavior because everyone’s worldview is situated so similarly. In this case, \n57 \n \nI think it would be important to introduce the idea of PGPs, even if no one identifies as \ntransgender or genderqueer because it serves as a constant reminder of the cultural limitations \nwithin that geographic area.   \n \nThird, the workplace needs to have better policies to promote a safe environment for the LGBTQ \ncommunity. Nadal states, “Workplaces are sites where microaggressions occur frequently. One \nof the difficulties here is that many factors may influence the ways in which microaggressions \nmanifest and the ways in which people react” (183). There two main reasons as to why this could \nbe the case. “First, because of the power dynamics between employers and employees and \ncoworkers, it may be difficult to confront microaggressions…Second, because microaggressions \nare so subtle and innocuous, it can be difficult for an individual to “prove” that they were \nexposed to a microaggression” (183).  \n \nThus, Nadal offers some correctives for employers. He asserts, “Perhaps the most important \nthing is to integrate education about microaggressions into multicultural competence training \nmodels in all workplace settings and other institutions (183). Nadal also brings up the issue of \ndiversity trainings, which often exclude sexual orientation and gender identity. Thus, he offers \nthe training modules instead. \n \nAt work, PGPs should be used on the first day of an employee’s job, or at least when coworkers \ncan get to meet the employee. This should establish a person’s PGPs before microaggressions \noccur. It is also necessary to periodically ask if that person’s PGPs have changed, as sometimes \nthis may occur due to various circumstances (e.g. sex change operation).  \n58 \n \n \nFinally, neighborhoods and communities are an important places to create an LGBTQ-inclusive \nenvironment. These can include public spaces (e.g., shopping malls, restaurants, public parks), \nreligious institutions (e.g., mosques, temples, churches), and other organizations (e.g., sports \nleagues, community centers)” (Nadal 185).  Nadal continues, “Many of the microaggressions \nthat occur in these settings may be those types of incidents that are spontaneous and that people \ndo not know how to react to immediately” (185). Thus, this highlights the different \ncircumstances for reacting as compared to that of families and workplaces.  \n \nIt is therefore necessary to set rules about PGPs as soon as possible. The sooner that a \nneighborhood or community recognizes its diverse population, the sooner it can change its \nbehavior to accommodate the new community. Furthermore, it increases the respect people in \nthese communities have for each other. If ‘misgendering’ does occur, Nadal suggests \nacknowledging the microaggression as soon as possible and then comforting the victim.  \n \nFinally, the government can help by promoting active citizenship. Nadal states, “My final set of \nrecommendations is for changes in government and policies” (186). He mentions four main \nrecommendations: emphasizing common ground; describing concrete harms; telling your \npersonal stories; and providing a historical context.  \n \nIn regards to PGPs, the government should focus on Nadal’s third recommendation of telling \nyour personal stories. This way, citizens can connect emotionally to the cause, which makes the \nuse of PGPs an even nobler act of courage.  \n59 \n \n \nFuture research \nBecause stigma is hard to measure at any point in time, it is difficult to predict how tolerant \npeople will be of the LGBTQ community at any point in the future. However, I recommend that \nstudies both outside and inside the discipline of English examine what is taking place in the \nvarious multimedia channels that are emerging. By focusing on the user experience, both \nscholars and practitioners may be able to find trends in the changing English language, \nparticularly with respect to gender-neutral pronouns. Therefore, the more awareness and \npracticability that studies of this nature will receive, the more society will erase the stigma \nassociated with the LGBTQ community. The transgender community, especially, deserves our \nutmost respect and action at this juncture in time. \n \n  \n60 \n \nWORKS CITED \n \nCDC.

    "abstract": "When the Supreme Court of the United States guaranteed the right to marry for same-sex couples in Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, 2015, the issue of integrating the LGBTQ community into society was propelled into the national spotlight. While many same-sex partners, many of whom identify as cisgender (those who identify with the sex they were assigned at birth), are able to  enjoy the tangible and psychological benefits of the ruling, the transgender and genderqueer communities continue to wait on a Supreme Court ruling in which they are able to celebrate with as much fervor. Thus, the acceptance of gender-neutral pronouns has become an important stepping stone for achieving equality for the transgender and genderqueer communities. In order to achieve this goal, it is important to determine how to convince society of embracing the concept of pronoun introductions. Therefore, this thesis will be analyzing trends in the use of gender-neutral pronouns in the English language, since gender-neutral pronouns help break down systems inherent in language in order to form new ones. I will first discuss the histories and challenges of integrating gender-neutral pronouns into the English vernacular. Then, I will explore the physical and virtual spaces in which gender-neutral pronouns are used, especially as introductions. Finally, I will examine Internet slang in virtual spaces in order to suggest the Internet as a medium of linguistic transformation that can affect physical spaces as well",
