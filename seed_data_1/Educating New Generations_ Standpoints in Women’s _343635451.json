Therefore, followingthe historical path of gender studies (GS) and women’s studies(WS), this article explores the current feminist and gender dis-course in order to catch a glimpse of what will be needed to fillthis gap. To clarify which women’s and gender studies stand-points are taught to new generations in Italy, lexicometric andcorrespondence analysis were performed on the descriptions ofuniversities courses teaching WS and GS perspectives. Althoughthe international spread of these two perspectives in academia isstill wide, the results indicate a consistent lack of these courses inItalian institutions of higher education and, moreover, separateviewpoints associated with the two perspectives.KEYWORDSGender and women’sstudies; LGBTQ studies;Italian academia; Italianfeminism; lexicometricanalysisWhereas non-recurring workshops or training courses on LGBTQ+ topics can befound inside and outside the formal Italian academic frameworks, the onlyuniversity course on related themes, Storia dell’omosessualità (History of homo-sexuality) held at University of Turin, first started in 2017 (Willan, 2017). Thisundergraduate-level class is currently the only one that allows Italian universitystudents to have access to masculinities, LGBTQ+ and sexual orientation contentwithin a formal university framework. However, it should not be surprising that inItaly, one of the latest European countries to recognize same-sex couples, LGBTQ+ are not included in academic curricula, reflecting both a national political andcultural situation of stasis in relation to these topics, and an international resis-tance to integrate gender equality perspectives into the university programs(Cassese, Bos, & Duncan, 2012; Verge, Ferrer-Fons, & González, 2018). Apartfrom one publication covering from ancient times to the post–World War IIperiod (Dall’Orto, 2015), up till now an extensive historiography on the Italianhistory of homosexuality from the protagonist’s point of view is still missingCONTACT Marta Prandelli marta.prandelli@gmail.com FISPPA Department, University of Padua, viaMelchiorre Cesarotti 10/12, Padova 35123, Italy.JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITYhttps://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2019.1582219© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC(Benadusi, 2007; Scaramella, 2016). As a matter of fact, although young research-ers and scholars are increasingly paying attention in order to fill this lack, “whatseems to fail in the Italian environment is perhaps the institutional awareness”(Scaramella, 2016, p. 3), which, along with a traditional reluctance to addresssexuality and the topic’s innate complex multidisciplinary area of competence,contributed to determine this Italian delay. Following the historical path of genderstudies and women’s studies,1 this article will explore the current feminist andgender discourse in order to catch a glimpse of what will be needed to fill this gap.First, for the purpose of tracing the cultural, historical, and political processes thatfailed to provide a favorable foundation for the advance of LGBTQ+ studies andthe spread of women’s and gender studies inside Italian academia, the history ofnational feminist movements and LGBT standpoints will be outlined, since theissues addressed and their subsequent greater diffusion played a crucial role inshaping the current scenario. Second, a text analysis of the Italian universitycourses focused on gender and women’s studies will be presented in order toanalyze the manifest and underlying related topics currently taught to new gen-erations in Italy and, in wider terms, to investigate the different views that stillshape the Italian academic situation on thematter.More broadly, the investigationof students’ access to gender and women’s perspectives will allow us to outline ifand how young citizens understand the intersections between gender, sexualidentity, ethnicity, race, and class and, consequently, how Italian youth’s proble-matize and contest gender norms, models, and stereotypes (Verge et al., 2018).Feminism in Italy: A historical perspectiveWhile the spread of the feminist thought in Europe had been extensive, theItalian context was less permeable. The impact of the Suffragettes’movements ofthe First Wave (1848–1918), pursuing legal recognition and economic equalitythrough the calling for the right to vote and equal education, remained con-strained within the borders of United States and United Kingdom, as well as tothe heterosexual, cultured, and upper-middle-class women they were speakingto (Cavarero & Restaino, 2002). An actual literature on First Wave movementsin Italy cannot in fact be identified (Giozza, 2017; Tarnopolsky, 2011), despitea law supporting women’s suffrage introduced in parliament in 1922. Themassive—but systematically marginalized—participation of women in the dif-ferent national political contexts (e.g., political groups, trade unions, studentmovements) started to diminish after the settlement of the fascist regime.Stripped of their freedom, womenwere only allowed to cover the role of mothersand wives, as contraception and abortion became prohibited and their mobility,personal correspondence, and social conduct were legally subjected to thehusband. Additionally, “the persecution of any behavior that did not conformto state-imposed rules, [was] the basic instrument that fascism implemented inits attempt to completely regenerate Italian society” (Benadusi, Dingee, &2 M. PRANDELLI ET AL.Pudney, 2012, p. 111). Although no explicit law declared homosexuality asa crime, the dictatorship took strong actions against the “vice,” affirming thatItalians were too virile to be homosexual (Dall’Orto, 1999) and proclaiminghomosexual behavior punishable as public indecency (Royal Decree 773/1931).Consequently, anyone could be condemned for indecent behavior or solicita-tion, two crimes and terms that had acquired a very broad meaning during theregime. Whether the person was actually homosexual or not did not reallymatter; the accusation and the practice of homosexuality became a commondeterrent for attacking political adversaries, when needed to eradicate an oppos-ing radical voice or to dismiss, threaten, or blackmail thorny public figures(Benadusi et al., 2012). In this scenario, the first attempts to createa movement for gay freedom in Italy were actually put in place by Aldo Mieli,founder of the journal Rassegna di studi sessuali in 1922. However, after a fewyears of struggle to preserve the journal, he was forced to emigrate (Dall’Orto,1988), as many radical supporters of women’s rights did during those years,leaving behind their political projects.At the end of the war, formal equality between the sexes (Art. 3) as well as themoral and legal equality of the spouses were first recognized in the Constitution,yet most forms of legal discrimination were not debated until the followingdecades. Starting from the 1970s, the emergence of the Second Wave movement,mostly in Europe and United States, shifted the feminist agenda on women’ssubjectivity and on the maintenance of a subordinate position—domestic laborand role of caring especially—to which neither the legal regulation nor theprogressivemovements were able to cope with (Davis, 1981). After a first commonseparatist approach, linked to the diffusion of the practices (Cavarero & Restaino,2002), the spread of different directions of thought became more evident (Offen,1988). In North America authors began to consider the multiplicity and fragmen-tation of different forms of oppression against identities not conforming to theheterosexual wealthy, cultured White male ideal prototype: ranging from lesbian-ism and “deviant” sexuality matter (Rich, 1980; Rubin, 1984), through the debateon gender and ethnicity (Davis, 1981; Hooks, 1981; Lorde, 1984), to the origin ofqueer studies (Butler, 1990, 1993; De Lauretis, 1999). Moreover, Stonewall riots in1969, the rise of the LGBTQ+ movement, the Black Panther party inception in1966 and the Black rights movement activism contributed to an ever-changingfeminist debate during a 30-year period, leading to continuously expanding theconversation on different topics. During the same years in France, the theory ofsexual difference became established. Starting from the work of Irigaray (1974),the French authors focused on the criticism and the deconstruction of psycho-analysis, deemed to be responsible for the alleged natural inferiority of women.The Second Wave experience in Italy, on the other hand, was character-ized mainly by the foundation of the first feminist groups emphasizingwomen’s difference, more than equality, in order to emancipate them frommen’s dominion. As a consequence, these groups promoted women’sJOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY 3estrangement from traditional politics, harshly criticizing an establishedmodel of hierarchization and distribution of power grounded in a sociallyshared androcentric premise according to which the res publica is supposedto be men’s dominion. The pursuit of the peculiar feminine differencethrough the individual accounts, however, clashed with the specific narrativeof lesbian subjectivity. Whereas the encounter of these collectives withlesbian women brought, on the one hand, new forms of expression anddifferent awareness, on the other it has raised numerous issues leading toa breakdown. This fracture caused a division between feminists and lesbiansinto distinct political movements (Mercandino, 2013), losing the chance tostart a narration of the Italian homosexual point of view, in tune witha reality grounded in the grassroots experience. This detachment is to beconsidered even more relevant as these women shared a common anti-patriarchal, anti-capitalist, and anti-fascist foundation (Danna, 2010) andsince the lack of willingness to debate the sexualized experience was clearlydeclared: “being a community of women was an extraordinary experience,the greatest discovery of which was that there was an intense eroticism. It wasnot lesbianism, but sexuality not imprisoned in male desire” (Libreria delledonne di Milano, 1987).The establishment of the Società delle Storiche and Società delle Letterate in1989 and 1995, and of the Libreria delle Donne (founded in 1975), can beconsidered particularly relevant mainly for their original training and divul-ging intent, formally linked to history, literature, and philosophy. WhileSocietà delle Storiche aims to promote historical, educational and documen-tary research in the field of women and gender history, Società delle Letterateaspires to produce, disseminate and spread female knowledge; whereasLiberia delle Donne is a feminist group cherishing women’s difference,nurtured by the practice of relationship and the attention given to poetry,literature, and philosophy. Libreria is the place where politics is discussedand conceived differently. This group prefers to use the “start from oneself”politics, considered as a careful consideration on one’s own experience. It isfrom this theoretical and practical standpoint that Muraro and Cavarero2founded the philosophical community of Diotima in 1983. In retrospect, theessentialist current has had great resonance in Italy, starting in particularfrom Gilligan’s psychological studies on the “female morality” (1982, 1989,1992) and psychoanalytical studies by Irigaray (1974, 1977, 1984). Theperspective that states an innate quality of femininity was taken by Diotimaand spread nationally along with the view of an irreducible natural differencebetween man and woman. This consideration also seems to be sustained byCatholicism, as Pope Benedict XVI in 2004 (Ratzinger & Amato, 2004) tookup what was previously declared by the Sacred Congregation for CatholicEducation (1983) and Pope John Paul II (1988, 1995), reiterating the idea4 M. PRANDELLI ET AL.that women are naturally and essentially devoted to love and care, ina specific and irreducible way.Meanwhile, the 10 years’ span between the 1960s and 1970s was also char-acterized by the emergence of the first LGBT groups, finally able to expressthemselves, once one of the major Italian political forces—Christian DemocraticParty—was no longer able to oppose these groups’ attempts to freely associate.At the same time, sexual liberation groups, such as the pioneering group Fuori!,planned to develop an autonomous revolutionary political subjectivity in orderto achieve public visibility (Cavarocchi, 2010). The importance placed on thecounter-cultural, ludic, and irreverent movement, and the attention to body andsexuality, promoted the development of new LGBT groups, culminating in the“Three Days Against Repression” Conference held in Bologna in 1977.In the following years, part of Italian feminism became established ingovernment institutions, and its co-optation led to the almost total disap-pearance of generations of activists and to the rejection of the term feministby many young people (Biglia, 2006). However, writing the history of Italianfeminism continued to be complicated: “compared to what has been pub-lished and is being published about the women’s movement in otherEuropean countries […] the Italian production of the 1990s has been andis, in fact, non-existent” (Di Cori, 2004, p. 104). On the other hand, duringthe 1980s the LGBT movement started to advocate for the legalization ofhomosexuality and the granting of protection rights as a symbolic startingpoint for changing the collective mindset (Rossi Barilli, 1999), findinga strong opposition in the representatives of the Christian DemocraticParty, who sought to defend the “traditional family.” At the end of thedecade, the political instability obstructed the debate on gender-relatedviolence, sexual assault, and LGBT rights. While the path toward the promo-tion of women’s rights in Italy has reached important milestones in the last60 years, the national recognition of LGBTQ+ rights has only just begun. Thefight to introduce legislation that would protect the LGBTQ+ communityagainst discrimination and homophobic violence has led to the adoption ofa few specific regional regulations. An attempt to extend the main legislativeinstrument that the Italian legal system offers for the repression of hatecrimes—the Mancino law (2015/1993)—to homophobia and transphobia isstill ongoing. The proposal was approved by the lower house of the ItalianParliament in September 2013 and is still to be discussed by the Senate. Onthe other hand, the legal recognition of civil unions and cohabitationbetween same-sex couples was promulgated only in 2016.3In relation to the academic path, even though Italian stances can be consideredconsistent with themes and claims that characterized the standpoints of SecondWave internationally, the development of contents linked to the queer and theThird Wave movements have assumed peculiar and atypical characteristics inItaly. First, women’s studies courses were introduced belatedly,4 and, second, newJOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY 5theories, epistemologies, and research methodologies are still not wholly acceptedor established in the country (Cori, 2013). Moreover, still today the tendency is toconsider feminist and gender issues as an exclusively female field,5 and the absenceof shared languages and definitions has led to a confused situation, especiallywhen “gender studies” and “women’s studies” labels are used in an arbitrarymanner, depending on the theoretical and political positions of the lecturers(Cori, 2013; Nussbaum, 1997). Indeed, the academic preference for the termgender might be due to the recall of an apparent scientific rigor, if compared tothe more provocative “feminist/women studies” (Taronna, 2004), which led DiCori to declare that teaching gender studies “under disguise” is the legacy of a longItalian tradition started in the 1970s (2013).Finally, it seems that the current and future Italian situation of genderstudies and women’s studies is also linked to student’s motivation to parti-cipate: “what worries the most is the decline in interest of first cycle degreestudents for feminist or gender issues” (Giorgio, Chemello, Crivelli, & Wood,2010, p. 258). Chemello also confirmed this matter, adding that to manyPaduan university students the existence of gender studies, but also offeminism and women’s literature, is a real discovery. This tendency is alsocorroborated outside the Italian academic context, as highlighted by Spoorand Lehmiller’s recent study (2014) showing that students are generally moreinterested in taking gender-titled courses than women-titled courses, andunderlining the mainly female interest around these topics.The Italian spot: Good practices and social initiativesRecent years seemed to be more positively oriented, as attempts to main-stream women’s, gender, and LGBTQI+ perspectives in lower and higherlevels of education have been pursued by various national efforts that were,however, poorly implemented or failed to reach the desired effect. Indeed, theItalian government has attempted to include a gender perspective in thedifferent levels of education, aiming at aligning the country with the equiva-lent European policies. The 2004 proposition to introduce advanced gradu-ate-level courses of “Women, Politics, and Institutions” into 35 Italianuniversities is emblematic (Magaraggia & Leone, 2010). Although this wasthe most massive attempt to create a shared background among the expertsof the subject, 10 years later the majority of these courses are not active.Furthermore, it is still not possible to offer homogeneous programs in genderand women’s studies6 among the different levels of education, includinguniversities, allowing the retention of a partial vision on the subjects.Other attempts to introduce a gender perspective specifically in primary andhigh school have instead led tomore complex consequences. A series of bookletswere written by the A.T. Beck Institute on the UNAR7 mandate to implementspecific teaching modules for preventing and contrasting homophobia and6 M. PRANDELLI ET AL.homophobic bullying in schools, adopting a scientific, not ideological, perspec-tive (A.T. Beck Institute, 2014). The booklets have never been used in schoolsand are currently available only on the A.T. Beck Institute Web site, as theministry suspended their employment following the public accusation of carry-ing out a “homosexualist” propaganda aimed at manipulating children andadolescents. Although these publications were prompted by the need to bringinto the schools the debate on gender violence, violence against children, childpornography, and all forms of bullying, including homophobic and transphobicones (Montano, 2014), the media campaign, promoted primarily by theEpiscopal Conference of Italy (CEI), conveyed the message that the introductionof gender studies in the compulsory educational years could be interpreted asa “persecutory strategy against the family, an attack aimed at deconstructing theperson and, therefore, society” (Bagnasco, 2014).Alongside this serious episode of obstruction against national antidiscri-mination policies, numerous initiatives were disseminated by minoritygroups tied to the Catholic environment, starting from the homosexualitycure promoted by the Lot Group, to the “anti-gender” material distributed byreligious high school teachers, affirming that “being gay is a psychologicalproblem” and that the opening to gay rights is the prelude of polygamy andpedophilia (Marzano, 2015). Considering the state of gender and women’sstudies, the reaction of the academic contexts before such situations has beentepid and not very incisive. While there still is no legitimation of gender andwomen’s studies within universities, structured courses dedicated to genderstudies and women’s studies and LGBTQI+ issues are missing, and attemptsto inform through educational texts, such as Marzano’s (2015), are welcomedwith controversy and boycotting attitudes. Moreover, it seems that an aca-demic position on these topics is late in coming, leaving the Italian publicwithout an academic point of view on the matter.Aims and methodsThis research was developed thanks to a broader project involving Italy, Spain,and the UK, aimed at exploring the state of the art of university educationregarding feminist epistemology and methodology and gender studies.8 Startingfrom this joint research, the authors decided to deepen the theme in the Italiancontext by settingmore definite objects. The very first aim of this research was toexplore the occurrence of university courses on gender and women’s studies inItaly, paying specific attention to epistemology and methodology courses.Starting from this purpose, this article intends to investigate the matter in themost recent years, aiming, in particular, to (1) underline how women’s andgender studies are presented to today’s students in higher levels of education,and (2) compare the descriptors of the courses held in the two interdisciplinaryfields to examine if they are similarly or differently conveyed.JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY 7The initial research was focused on finding how gender studies and women’sstudies are framed inside the Italian higher education system. Italian universityprograms are mainly divided in two cycles.9 The first one corresponds to under-graduate degree programs, lasting three years and providing studentsa preliminary education on a subject. The second cycle lasts two years, corre-sponding to master’s degree programs, where a first-cycle degree or comparableforeign degree is required in order to access. These programs provide studentswith higher theoretical and practical preparation. Specific trainings, such asarchitecture, law, construction engineering/architecture, pharmacy, veterinary,and primary education are based on a single-cycle program lasting five years, orsix years in the case of dentistry or medicine and surgery. Undergraduate andmaster’s degree programs sharing common topics and objectives are grouped intoso-called Classi di laurea (classes of degree). A series of requirements are set foreach class, allowing universities to choose different teaching and practical activitiesprovided that they respect the national requirements and a set number of CreditiFormativi Universitari (CFU or ECTS).10 Additionally, each discipline of theItalian university system is formally coded into one of the 367 Settori ScientificoDisciplinari (SSD; scientific disciplinary sectors), and they are regulated by theItalian Ministry of Education and grouped into 188 Settori Concorsuali (sectors),88 Macrosettori (macro-sectors), and 14 Aree (areas).11 Gender studies andwomen’s studies are not considered specific SSD, whereas only a gender-relatedfocus can be found in the description of three SSDs included in the area ofhistorical, philosophical, educational, and psychological sciences (M-STO/01Medieval History; M-STO/02 Modern History; M-STO/04 ContemporaryHistory) and one SSD related to the area of economical and statistical sciences(SECS-S/05 Social Statistics). In addition, no class of degree is exclusively related towomen’s studies or gender studies, while the development of a gender-sensitiveperspective is mentioned among the educational objectives of six first-cycleprograms and 11 second-cycle programs (Table 1), confirming previous research(Antonelli, Sarra, & Sorrentino, 2013). It is therefore clear that one of the mainreasons for the absence of specific programs or courses majoring in gender studiesand women’s studies is the lack of a formal disciplinary area or class of degree.Starting from this understanding of the Italian university system, the firsttwo authors looked for undergraduate and master’s courses and programsfocused on gender and women’s studies. The search for relevant material wasconducted online, first by looking for Italian programs started in the2014–2015 and 2015–2016 academic years in both public and privateItalian universities. The very same parameters were subsequently used tofocus the research on gender studies and women’s studies undergraduate andmaster’s-level courses held in all the Italian university programs.Specific research keys were set through brainstorming between the first andthe second author, leading to two lists of words, both in Italian and in English,related to the research paradigm (metodologia, methodology, method*,8 M. PRANDELLI ET AL.epistempology, epistemol*, ontology, ontol*) and the broad topic (gender;genere, difference, differenza, donn*, wom*, fem*).12 The keywords were initi-ally used to conduct extensive research through the Google search engine, andthe results were then refined using specialized Web sites (Osservatorio delladifferenza, iaph Italy, Società delle Storiche, and Milly Villa Center), nationalinstitutional databases (Almalaurea, Cineca and Cestor), and the educationaloffer section of university Web sites. As a result, one master’s degree programand 69 courses (14 undergraduate and 55 master’s) presenting a semanticreference to gender/women’s studies were found. The reliability of these resultswas guaranteed by the employment of institutional Web sites (e.g., Cineca,Almalaurea) linked to the Italian Ministry of Education database. However,this initial exploration was based mainly on the titles of the courses, possiblyleaving other courses addressing gender studies and women’s studies issues outof the results. It is important to underline some preliminary aspects: only 24 outof 91 public and private Italian universities13 offer gender studies and women’sstudies related courses, and the University of Bologna by itself offers 30 of the 69courses. This high number is certainly influenced by the presence in thisuniversity of GEMMA, the only master’s degree program in women’s andgender studies in Italy, and the first one in Europe. GEMMA includes 18 ofthe 69 resulting courses on language and literature (12), history (4), sociology(1), and law (1). Formally, GEMMA is part of the master’s degree program inmodern, comparative, and postcolonial literature. This element, along with thedisciplinary areas of the 69 courses, underlines that the academic viewpoint ongender studies and women’s studies is currently framed in the language andliterature area of knowledge (Table 2), hence confirming that literature still is themain mean used to teach these topics.Table 1.

The course descriptions have been chosen not only because they are thecourse presentation, but also because a description holds the main topics andmethods that lecturers refer to during classes, and its examination can revealboth the explicit and underlying themes related to the course. In order toconduct a coherent analysis of the texts, specific inclusion criteria were set.Specifically, 52 of the 69 course descriptions were included, followinga selection based on language,14 uniqueness, and presence of an actualdescription.Analysis procedure and resultsThe set of all the course descriptions (text corpus) was initially exploredusing the Lexical and Textual Automatic Treatment for Content Analysis(TaLTaC2) software to highlight the text content and to analyze the lexico-metric characteristics of the corpus and evaluate its adequacy for the analysis.The first step of this analysis consisted in the corpus normalization15 and ina subsequent assessment of its lexicometric characteristics. Once it wasconfirmed that the resultant characteristics (Table 3) were acceptable(Tuzzi, 2003), we conducted a manual selection of the most informativesequences of words, producing a list containing multi-words and sequencesof words that were later used to conduct a basic lexicalization16 procedure.Following this preparatory phase, we could proceed with the two mainanalyses of the corpus.Table 2.

PRANDELLI ET AL.Analysis of the distinctive lexiconThe analysis of the lexicon started with the identification of the main seg-ments, using TaLTaC2 software (Bolasco, 2010), which subsequently allowedus to reduce synonyms and to fix the inclusion frequencies threshold, usingSpad software (Lebart, Morineau, Becue, & Haeusler, 1989). This processpermitted us to highlight words showing a high probability of being overusedin relation to a specific variable. In this case, the analysis was conducted onthe lexicon characteristics of the two fields of studies taken into account:women’s and gender studies (two modalities). The lexical (or thematic)profile of each of these variables was therefore analyzed, and, as a result, itwas possible to extrapolate those words that are under- or overrepresented ina specific variable if compared to the whole corpus. In order to fulfill thepurposes of the current research and to be able to address properly theresearch questions, only overused lexicon was examined.17The application of this procedure offers further support in the criticalreading of a text, since the investigation of the distinctive words allowsresearchers to examine the profile of each category related to the corpus,starting from a probabilistic hypothesis of equidistribution of the forms inthe text.18 While conducting this research, it seemed useful to determine thethematic references represented in the two groups of courses, mainly becausethis type of analysis can be used to distinguish otherwise hardly perceptibledifferences, allowing an interaction between extra-text variables with thetextual ones, therefore going beyond a simple sequential reading of the text.The following results are divided by the two disciplinary fields of studytaken into account (Table 4). In the first approach, the one concerning thevocabulary used in the descriptions of women’s studies courses, the lexiconappears to refer to historical, juridical, and literary aspects. The historical sideconcerns not only a general and generic attention to the temporal context ofreference (civilization, memory, XX century, war), but also the precise evolu-tion of women’s movements, which were conducted by women, aimed atenhancing the feminine and, especially in Italy, based on the use of actualpractices, as previously outlined, in order to enhance comparison betweenexperiences (e.g., personal events, forms of knowledge, emotions). The jur-idical aspects of the lexicon, on the other hand, are linked both to theinformal forms of feminist activism, such as the public demonstrations forwomen’s rights recognition (war, rights), and to the subsequent developmentof policies and practices designed to change the legal framework, on the basisof the support offered mostly by international law, which provide legalinstruments to protect certain social groups, rather than national emanations,which have been proven to be fallacious in several occasions. Finally, asextensively highlighted in the introductory part of this article, a major aspectof women’s studies is reconfirmed to be that of literature, the field that hasJOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY 11mostly endorsed the way of feminist thought in Italy, through the establish-ment of groups of women that have used writing and the women’s voice asa way to convey a message of equality or detachment from the masculine(writers, novel, literary text, literature).The core aspects emerging from the analysis of gender studies coursedescriptions are the ones linked to a cultural and social identity, allowingus to frame the descriptions in two main themes: the first one concerningsexuality and the second one regarding gender and gender*.19 Both of thesetopics led to the entrance of the gender studies discourse into the politicalenvironment (debate, institutions, politicization) and the individual and col-lective sociocultural context (media, socials, cultural, kinship, socialization,educational, family, kinship anthropology). Lastly, references to literature andphilosophy (semiotics, text, science) can be found even in the gender studiescourse descriptions.Correspondence analysisIn line with the aim of the research, a second investigation was conducted toidentify the underlying dimensions between the texts and to grasp the core“networks of meaning” (Nencini, Sarrica, Romaioli, & Contarello, 2008,p. 286). Correspondence analysis allows us to identify dimensions underlyingthe data that summarize the multiple relationships between the originalvariables and the words of the corpus. These dimensions are called “factors,”while the original variables are “active variables.” Factors are synthesisTable 4.

Spad software was used to identify underlyingthematic categories and the implicit references used by lecturers to articulatewomen’s and gender studies in an academic context. For this second analysis,the nine disciplinary areas of the courses were used as original variables.Through the analysis of simple correspondences, performed using thewords × disciplines matrix (dimensions 2861 × 9), it was possible to highlightand consider the first factor, which explains 13.95% of the total inertia, andthe second factor, explaining 13.37% of total inertia.The first factor, related to the disciplinary areas of sociology, educationalsciences, and languages and literature, is defined by different aspects thatmainly concern the question of women and the female world. The secondfactor, instead, moves away from the philosophical question of the feministidentity path to carry out the gaze in favor of the educational and sociologicalside, represented by the media world (cinema, film) and the cultural andfamily aspects that have characterized the Italian scenario in the debatebetween sexuality, gender, and genres (Table 5).A deeper analysis of the factors allowed a more detailed interpretation thanksto the examination of each factor’s constitutive elements (Table 6). Factor 1 canbe explained using the opposition betweenmovement and activism. The positivesemi-axis is defined by the discipline area of language and literature and bywords that can be related to the concept of movement. Whereas literature hasbeen the main means through which feminist movements were able to spread inItaly, attention toward history analysis, literature, and feminine knowledge can beseen as a form of intellectual engagement, a “movement” based on and safe-guarded by the group, where individuals share experiences and interests towardthe cultural involvement, promoting group actions based on structures andstrategies that may help oppressed groups to join together to face differentchallenges (Glasberg & Shannon, 2010). Equally, the negative semi-axis of thefactor, defined by educational sciences and sociology disciplines, was labeled“activism,” referring to all the forms of sociological and educational efforts thatare moved by the need to conquer a form of recognition (rights, gender) throughthe acknowledgment of different perspectives.Similarly, the poles of Factor 2 oppose forms of “progressive knowledge”(education, processes, and science on the negative semi-axis), to the ones relatedto a more “reflective knowledge,” based on a feminist view that is grounded ondifferences and is aimed to understand and analyze contexts. Whereas specificattention is paid to different ways of achieving knowledge, it is important tounderline that Factor 2 is defined by the disciplines of educational sciences onthe positive semi-axis and by law and sociology on the negative semi-axis;therefore, the main aim of this factor seems to be the reaching of a form ofunderstanding that helps to educate individuals and society.JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY 13Table5.Factor1and2(wordsdisciplinarysectors),contributionsofthevariable“Disciplinarysectors.”FactorDisciplinarysectorCoordinatesAbsolutecontributionRelativeContributionWordsCoordinatesAbsolutecontributionRelativeContributionFirst,inertia=13.95%Pedagogy−0.6018.100.24Languageandliterature0.8447.700.67Sociology−1.2014.320.160.59Second,inertia=13.37Law−0.690.20.65Pedagogy0.7327.900.35Sociology−0.400.10.4814 M.

More broadly, gender and women’s studiesexploration is here intended also as a means to explore how issues related tosex, sexuality, sexual orientation, and similar identity-based academic fieldsare disseminated and discussed inside Italian academia.The results showed varied aspects and trajectories. First, this researchconfirmed an unbalanced distribution of gender studies and women’s studiescourses in the diverse disciplines starting from the initial analyses of theItalian university system, which underlined a lack of generalized disciplinaryopenness in adopting a gender perspective, while the attachment to thosedisciplines that have facilitated Italian feminism is still strong. On the onehand, there is a lack of gender studies and women’s studies courses in theeconomic, sports, and medical and surgical fields, despite the fact that thenational university system establishes a specific indication of gender-sensitivetraining in these areas (Table 1). More broadly, the widespread absence ofgender studies and women’s studies courses in diverse disciplines is alsomanifest in those fields that are internationally recognized for the employ-ment of gender, women’s, and LGBTQ+ studies, such as psychology, butwhich are not recognized as such by the SSDs description provided by theItalian university system. On the other hand, most of the courses fall withinthe language and literature field, maintaining a stable thematic link withthose first Italian institutions openly directed at feminist teaching (Societàdelle storiche and Società delle letterate). However, the courses are largely heldat the University of Bologna mainly as part of the GEMMA master’s pro-gram. The fact that an international master’s program influences the resultsto such an extent is an important detail and could point out that theinternational frame is currently the only way to establish and maintaina degree course solely dedicated to women’s and/or gender studies in Italy.Second, the two fields of interdisciplinary studies are only apparentlyseparated. In fact, results suggest that, while adopting different lexical voca-bularies, the areas of interest and the underlying themes remain the same inboth gender and women’s studies, just as approaches, aims, and perspectives.However, it is interesting to underline that sexuality emerges only in thelexicon of gender studies courses, showing a deviance in the gender studiesand women’s studies common path mainly traced by literature. Followingthis hint, the lexicon in gender studies courses presents references to politicaland sociocultural contexts, giving a dynamic image, if compared to the moreestablished historical, juridical, and literary focus of the lexicon used in16 M. PRANDELLI ET AL.women’s studies courses. This characterization is also confirmed by theanalysis of the correspondence, where the first factor reflects such coreduplicity, as the underlying issues support the link between the enduringsaliency of the traditional standpoints related to a cultured historical move-ment and those forms of activism based on social recognition of diverseidentities. Coherently, the second factor enriches the characterization ofgender studies and women’s studies courses subtext, on the basis of therelation between two connected forms of knowledge, characterized by differ-ent shades of meaning. While progressive knowledge is connected to thetraditional advancement path followed by sciences in order to advance anddevelop their areas of expertise, reflective knowledge is related to forms ofdeep and considered understanding, through the employment of specificlenses, here feminism and difference.Lastly, when looking at gender studies and women’s studies courses’common aspects, it is interesting to note that sociology contributes to explainboth the observed factors (negative semi-axis), underlining the strong linkbetween the interdisciplinary fields of academic study, such as women’s andgender studies, and the sociocultural context in which they are immersed.The other disciplines that define the factors, educational sciences and lan-guage and literature (regarding the movement-activism pole) and law andeducational sciences (with respect to the knowledge poles), do confirma prevalence of an educational, intellectual, and statutory point of view inthis matter, emphasizing the educational aim of the courses.Starting from these results, women and gender studies courses seem toconvey both the topics related to Italian Second Wave feminism and theirdistinctive perspectives, methods, and epistemologies. Additionally, theresults’ references to sexuality and gender express an encouraging focusthat might help to discuss not only women’s stands, but also other identities,histories, and perceptions, consistent with the ones studied by men’s andLGBTQ+ studies. However, this message is still confined due to the smallnumber of the courses and the difficulties that women’s and gender studieshave encountered and still face both inside and outside the Italian univer-sities, missing the potential benefits of an open dialogue between academiaand society and expanding the discrepancies between theory and practice.Women’s condition in Italy can set an example on this matter. Feministtheories have certainly influenced the egalitarian policies of the last centuries,but they have not been able to transform these regulations into coherentforms of social awareness and community behavior. Despite the developmentof many social interventions, the systematic estrangement of Italian womenfrom social and political national power persists, resulting in forms ofdiscrimination. If we consider basic gender equality parameters, it seemsthat social consideration and treatment of women in Italy are not equal tomen’s, leaving the gender gap issue still open both inside and outsideJOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY 17academia (Anzivino & Vaira, 2017; World Economic Forum, 2016).Widening this line of reasoning to related issues, the emergence of queertheory, cyber and cyborg feminism, transgender and genderqueer politics,and cultural post-humanism, post-sexualism, and advanced biotechnology,including contraception and assisted reproduction techniques that freedwomen from the determinism of nature, resulted in the rejection of thegender binary that classifies humanity into two different and irreducibleforms: masculine and feminine. These theories have opened the path forcontemporary society to the possible guarantee of self-determination rightsfor all the citizens, although concretely the consequential social practices arenot equally certain. Moreover, the isolation of the only course conveying anLGBT perspective is the result of a historical absence of an academic andpublic discourse on the representations and the narratives of a free sexuality,which established a scenario where citizens do not have the instruments tonarrate their own experiences, producing a “real mutilation […] both forthose young people who have taken the feminist path, and for those who,although external, have not been able to grasp the influences hidden in thepublic conversation (Mercandino, 2013). However, the analysis of the lexiconshows that the absence of a discussion on sexuality is only apparent, con-firming that a discourse on such a fundamental topic is inevitable both in theindividuals’ private lives and in the cultural and social actions of the citizens.While recognizing the central role played by second-wave feminism in theItalian social context, the call to change must go beyond female subjectivity,taking into account sexualities and the sexual roles in order to understandtheir underlying meanings and the role they play as tools that maintain socialorder or promote societal change (Zemon Davis, 1976). Acting in thisperspective and given the widespread resistance encountered by the mostrecent attempts to include a gender perspective in social and educationalpolicies, the reforms of the university curricula can be seen as one of themost solid means to alter tacit social rules.This research therefore underlines that gender and women’s studies can bevalid allies in the debate concerning equality, social recognition, and self-determination of all citizens, especially in Italy, where women’s, lesbian, andgay people’s rights have been addressed belatedly. In order to do so, Italianacademia must emerge from the detached world of university teaching andresearch and must promote the adoption of gender and LGBTQ+ perspec-tives in multiple disciplines, aiming to intensify a continuous dialogue withsociety regarding the different issues related to sex, gender, and sexuality.Notes1. Women’s studies is referred to here as the set of studies and research built on the differentdeclinations of feminist thought and on the need to read and document contexts from18 M. PRANDELLI ET AL.women’s (mainly cisgender) point of view (Taronna, 2004). As claimed by Kimmich,“Women’s studies is an outgrowth of the feminist movement. It is its academic arm” (ascited in Maher, 2007, p. 1552). Instead, gender studies is “a field of inquiry that exploreshow femininity and masculinity are integral part of how people think about socialorganizations and institutions, dispositions of power, interpersonal relationships, andunderstandings of identity, sexuality, and subjectivity. An enlargement of what was initiallyknown as women’s studies, gender studies identifies, analyzes, and often critiques thedisparate effects of patriarchal organizations on women and men” (Roof, 2007, p. 324).2.

The first gender studies and women’s studies degree program was founded in Italy in2006, at the University of Bologna (http://www.lilec.it/gemma/), whereas women’sstudies university courses first appeared in the U.S. in the late 1960s (Buhle, 2000;Ginsberg, 2008).5. As underlined by Antonelli et al. (2013), “there is a feminization of lecturers: 87% arewomen and only 13% men, […] almost all researchers (34%) and associates (27%). Fullprofessors are only 23% while 16% are unstructured (non-tenured)” (p. 21).6. Gender and women’s studies are here separated on the bases of the differencesexplained in note 1.7.

Keywords related to men and masculinities or LGBTQ+ were excluded due to the lack ofuniversity courses on these topics and the consequent impossibility to perform an analysisdue to insufficient text. In particular, preliminary research showed that the only course onan LGBTQ+-related topic (History of homosexuality) first started in 2017–2018, subse-quently to the academic years taken into account in this research. Coherently, non-recurring academic workshops or training courses on these topics were excluded as thisresearch focuses on undergraduate and master’s-level courses/programs only. Therefore,the authors decided to keep the research on gender studies and women’s studies relatedkeywords in order to maintain a broad and inclusive point of view, focused on thoseoriginal perspectives that originated and inspired more recent fields of study related tosexuality and gender, such as LGBTQ+ and men’s studies.13.

Normalization is “the procedure of standardization of graphical forms aimed to eliminateirrelevant graphic differences and preserve relevant ones” (Bolasco, 2012, p. 11).16. As defined by Bolasco (2012), “lexicalisation represents a new parsing, through whichone individuates an entire locution as a single occurrence (multiword). This entails thatthe occurrences of the entire vocabulary must be calculated anew” (p. 13).Lexisalization allows one to treat composed words sequences as single forms that,without this process, would get lost throughout the automatic analysis of the textualdata (Bolasco, Morrone, & Baiocchi, 1999).17. setting α ≤ 0.05.18. When a word is equally distributed in all the subtexts, it is considered banal; when, onthe other hand, a word is overrepresented in one of the subtexts, it is consideredcharacteristic or specific (della Ratta-Rinaldi, 2002).19. The use of the asterisk here is motivated by the presence of the English word gender insteadof the Italian word genere in the course descriptions written in Italian. The use of the Englishword is usually due to the preservation of specific English word expressions in preference toan Italian translation (e.g., gender studies, gender sensitive). In few course descriptions, theuse of the English word genderwas not linked to a specific word expression, but rather to thelecturer’s choice to use the English word instead of the Italian one.AcknowledgmentSpecial thanks to David Primo and Valentina Rizzoli for their unique assistance and guidanceduring the analysis process.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.ORCIDMarta Prandelli http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8062-1098Ines Testoni http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2325-6450Barbara Biglia http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0135-4866ReferencesA.T.

    "abstract": "It should not be surprising that in Italy, one of the latest European countries to recognize same-sex couples, LGBTIQ+ concerns are not included in students’ academic curricula. Therefore, following the historical path of gender studies (GS) and women’s studies (WS), this article explores the current feminist and gender discourse in order to catch a glimpse of what will be needed to fill this gap. To clarify which women’s and gender studies standpoints are taught to new generations in Italy, lexicometric and correspondence analysis were performed on the descriptions of universities courses teaching WS and GS perspectives. Although the international spread of these two perspectives in academia is still wide, the results indicate a consistent lack of these courses in Italian institutions of higher education and, moreover, separate viewpoints associated with the two perspectives",
