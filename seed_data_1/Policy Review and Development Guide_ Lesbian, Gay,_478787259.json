In 2003, with the enactment of  the Prison Rape EliminationAct (PREA), the Project’s focus shifted to addressing prison rape—both staff  sexual misconduct and inmate-on-inmate sexual abuse. Beginning in 2006, Smith Consulting began a collaborative effort with the Project andNIC to focus efforts on providing technical assistance to the field of  corrections on a variety of  issues.Since the passage of  PREA in 2003, increased national and international attention has been paid to theissue of  sexual abuse of  individuals in custody. As identified by the National Prison Rape EliminationCommission [4] (NPREC) during its fact-finding process, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and intersex(LGBTI) individuals—both adults and youth—under custodial supervision are one of  the groups most at riskfor abuse. In June 2009, NPREC proposed comprehensive standards for eliminating sexual abuse of  LGBTIindividuals in custodial settings. The final standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of  Justice [5] (DOJ) inMay 2012 recognized the unique vulnerabilities of  LGBTI populations kept intact most of  NPREC’s findingsand recommendations and in several instances, strengthened the protections for LGBTI populations. DOJ iscontinuing to issue guidance on gender non-conforming individuals as it relates to the standards specificallythrough the FAQ section on the National PREA Resource Center’s [6] website.However, this fundamental question remains unanswered: Have the conditions changed that allow theabuse of  LGBTI individuals in custodial settings to occur? Although several state and local systems have madestrides in addressing sexual abuse of  LGBTI individuals in their care, much work remains. With the finalstandards as benchmarks, along with stronger laws protecting LGBTI individuals from abuse, progress can beswift and abuse of  LGBTI individuals in custody can be significantly reduced.In the first edition of  this guide, we aimed to reach out to correctional agencies in order to help themidentify, address, and respond to abuse of  LGBTI individuals through agency policies and procedures. Wehoped to deepen the dialogue between staff  and administrators as well as community leaders and criminaljustice advocates about strategies to eliminate abuse of  LGBTI individuals in custody. The second edition ofthis guide provides updated key information to correctional agencies about PREA’s impact on agency practiceas it relates to LGBTI individuals in custody.AcknowledgmentsPolicy Review and Development Guide: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Persons in CustodialSettingsSecond Editionis the work product of  many organizations and individuals concerned about preventingand addressing the abuse of  LGBTI adults and youth in custody. It addresses rapidly developing areas ofpractice and law in the United States.

Introduction and OverviewChapter 1. Introduction and OverviewIntroductionMeeting the needs and protecting the rights of  LGBTI people in various custodial settings presents both challenges andopportunities for society’s institutions, including law enforcement and corrections.Purpose and Intent of  this GuideThis policy guide will assist correctional administrators, medical and mental health staff, training coordinators, line staff, andpolicymakers as they craft policies to address the treatment of  LGBTI individuals in custodial settings. It may also help agencies thatare paying greater attention to the needs of  LGBTI individuals as they work to implement the PREA Standards, which requirecorrectional agencies to safely screen, classify, and house LGBTI inmates as well as those who have intersex conditions. Byintegrating information about LGBTI individuals into policies, practices, and organizational culture, agencies will be better able tomeet the needs of  these inmates and increase the skill level of  staff  who work with this population on a daily basis.This guide includes information that will help adult correctional facilities and juvenile justice agencies to assess, develop, orimprove policies and practices regarding LGBTI individuals in their custody. The guide is not meant to be a quick reference forwriting policies appropriate for all agencies and facilities. It is intentionally vague on “how-to” advice and “plug-and-play” policyguidance. Guides for writing policies exist in many forms.[1] Rather, the purpose of  this guide is to (1) define agencies’ obligations toLGBTI populations, both legally and in accordance with PREA Standards; (2) begin a dialogue within agencies regarding the safetyand treatment needs of  LGBTI populations; and (3) guide agencies in asking good questions about practices and implementationstrategies for meeting the needs of  LGBTI populations.Part of  the mission for all correctional agencies is to provide safe and secure environments for all individuals in their care andcustody. State and federal law imposes legal obligations on correctional and juvenile agencies for the treatment of  all persons incustody, with specific provisions for LGBTI populations. Agencies need policies to define and clarify the appropriate treatment ofLGBTI individuals in their custody and meet all constitutional and other obligations to provide humane treatment to those in theircustody. Additionally, strong policies can help mitigate the risk of  liability to the agency and its staff  in the event of  an incident orlitigation.Chapter 1 of  this policy guide discusses general terminology and the reasons that agencies need policies. It discusses theterminology necessary to understand issues of  sexual orientation. Having a basic understanding of  these terms helps us understandthe issues and concerns of  LGBTI individuals and the challenges they face in custodial settings. Understanding and proper use ofterminology are at the core of  developing policy and practice as they relate to LGBTI inmates and youth. In addition to this generaldiscussion of  terminology, there is a full glossary of  terms in Appendix A. It is important to remember that these terms are evolvingand can vary depending on who is using them. However, the glossary is consistent with the PREA Standards, and this set ofdefinitions is used in this publication. Chapter 2 addresses the needs of  juvenile justice agencies in creating policies for LGBTQIyouth in custody. Chapter 3 discusses the needs of  adult correctional settings (prisons, jails, and community corrections facilities) indeveloping LGBTI policies for inmates or residents. The appendices include a glossary; a case law digest; resources that addressLGBTI issues along with resources for LGBTQI youth and adults; sample policies for prisons, jails, community corrections, andjuvenile agencies; and training matrices.Issues in Providing Care and Safety for LGBTI Individuals in CustodyDuring the past three decades, an increasing number of  individuals have openly identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, ortransgender, and many young people are actively questioning their sexual orientation and gender identity. In addition, society hasdeveloped an increased awareness of  people living with intersex conditions. Today, individuals who are—or are perceived to be—LGBTI are a part of  nearly all segments of  society, including those who are inmates and staff  in correctional settings. Given theunique circumstance of  LGBTI people under the jurisdiction of  both adult and juvenile criminal justice systems, as well as thosewho are housed in immigration detention, correctional authorities must be able to ensure the safety of  LGBTI people in theircustody.In 2011, there was considerable change in legislative and policy decisions concerning LGBTI issues. Anti-bullying initiatives,such as the It Gets Better campaign, have raised public awareness about the struggles of  LGBTQI youth.[2] School administratorsresponded in turn, displaying a heightened sensitivity toward LGBTQI youth.[3] Schools enacted zero-tolerance policies and otheranti-bullying measures aimed at eradicating violence and aggression toward LGBTQI or other gender-nonconforming students.[4]Same-sex marriage advocates cheered the Obama administration’s decision to no longer defend Defense of  Marriage Act (DOMA)cases.[5] During the 2012 election season, voters were challenged to expand LGBTI rights, and they rose to the task; Maine,Maryland, and Washington joined Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, and the District ofColumbia in approving same-sex marriages.[6] Furthermore, Minnesota residents rejected a ballot measure to amend the stateconstitution to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.[7] Lastly, Wisconsin voters elected Tammy Baldwin as thefirst openly gay U.S. senator.[8]Unfortunately, a lack of  knowledge about LGBTI people, coupled with little guidance for correctional institutions on how tomaintain safety and how to respectfully communicate with this population, has resulted in significant challenges for LGBTI peoplein custody. The nature and severity of  these problems were at the forefront of  PREA’s enactment, the proposed Standardsdeveloped by the NPREC, and the final Standards issued by the DOJ.In April, 2007, the Center for Innovative Public Policies, Inc., through an initiative with the NIC, collaborated with TheProject on Addressing Prison Rape to sponsor the meeting “Working with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and IntersexPopulations in Corrections Systems: Identification of  Issues and Resources, Development of  Recommendations.”[9] The meetingbrought together a diverse group of  stakeholders, subject-matter experts, and corrections officials to identify challenges, proposesolutions, develop recommendations, and identify resources for agencies with LGBTI populations.During the meeting, the group identified approximately 30 separate challenges; the resulting unpublished report also made anumber of  important recommendations for improving the treatment of  LGBTI adults and youth in custody.A primary recommendation was to develop a policy guide for correctional agencies on the issue. The concept of  this policyguide was born from that recommendation; the guide seeks to address the needs identified during the 2007 meeting by providingpolicy and practice recommendations that will help correctional staff  who work with LGBTI adults and youth in custody.The final standard makes the following applicable to prisons, jails, and community confinement facilities: (1)transgender and intersex inmates must be given the opportunity to use the toilet and shower separately from otherinmates; and (2) it is prohibited to place LGBTI inmates in a dedicated unit or facility solely on the basis of  LGBTIidentification, unless such placement is pursuant to a legal requirement for the purpose of  protecting such inmates.[10]Evolving Terminology and DefinitionsTo address the needs of  LGBTI individuals in custodial settings, it is necessary to have a full understanding of  the basic andappropriate terms that individuals use to present themselves. The most basic concepts are “gender identity” and “sexual orientation.”Gender IdentityGender identity is a person’s internal, deeply felt sense of  being male or female, distinct from his or her sexual orientation.Everyone has a gender identity and, for many, their gender identity is consistent with their assigned sex at birth and their physicalanatomy.A transgender person has a gender identity that is different from his or her assigned sex at birth. A transgender woman is aperson whose birth sex is male but who understands herself  to be female and desires to live her life as a female; a transgender man isa person whose birth sex is female but who understands himself  to be male and desires to live life as a male. A transgender personmay publicly express his or her gender identity while very young, middle aged, or even elderly. Transition is the term that is oftenused to describe the time period when transgender people start publicly living their lives in accordance with their gender identity.Transition often includes a change in dress, hairstyle, and physical appearance; the use of  a new name; and a change in pronoun(from “he” to “she,” or vice versa). During transition, many transgender people will also begin to undergo medical treatments (suchas hormone therapy or surgery) to change their physical bodies to better match their gender identity; however, not all transgenderpeople undergo medical treatments.Some people’s gender-related appearance, characteristics, and behaviors—gender expression—cross genders or includeaspects of  both masculinity and femininity. The term gender nonconforming can be used to describe people whose genderexpression is outside of  societal assumptions for how men and women are expected to behave or appear.Many transgender people experience high levels of  distress that result in depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and even suicideideation.[11] For some, the high level of  distress develops into a condition known as either gender identity disorder (GID) orgender dysphoria.[12] In 2012, the American Psychological Association (APA) announced its intention to remove the term “GID”from the forthcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fifth edition ,and replace it with gender dysphoria.[13] The term “genderdysphoria” is used in this guide, except in circumstances where specific court holdings have turned on a GID diagnosis.Heterosexual people who are gender nonconforming, or do not conform to gender stereotypes, are often perceived byothers to be LGBTI and face many of  the same risks of  maltreatment in custodial settings as LGBTI people do.Sexual OrientationSexual orientation refers to a person’s romantic and physical attraction to members of  the same sex or a different sex. Thereis a continuum of  sexual orientation, from exclusively heterosexual or “straight” (attraction to members of  a different sex) toexclusively homosexual or “gay” or “lesbian” (attraction to members of  the same sex), along with degrees of  bisexuality (attractionto same-sex and different-sex people). People who are not sexually attracted to anyone are asexual. An asexual individual can stillexperience relationships but may not have feelings of  sexual attraction or the desire to act on these feelings if  they do occur.IntersexPeople who are intersex or have intersex conditions[14] are born with external genitalia, internal reproductive organs,chromosome patterns, or endocrine systems that do not fit typical definitions of  male or female. The medical conditions causingthese variations are sometimes grouped under the terms “intersex” or disorders of  sex development (DSD).[15] It is estimated that 1in 2,000 babies is born with an intersex condition.[16] Although most people with intersex conditions do not identify as transgender,due to their unique bodies or their gender expressions, many experience abuse and harassment in correctional settings similar to thetype of  abuse transgender people experience.Use of  Terminology and AcronymsOften, acronyms are used to refer to individuals who are “sexual minorities.” The most common acronym is LGBT—lesbian,gay, bisexual, and transgender—and is often used to identify the full community of  individuals who do not consider themselvesheterosexual or who are transgender.Some people also use “Q” to include individuals who self-identify as “queer” or “questioning” or both. The termquestioning refers to the active process in which young people explore their sexual orientation or gender identity or both andquestion the societal assumption that they are heterosexual or gender conforming. Many LGBT people go through this process ofquestioning before “coming out” (or telling other people that they identify as LGBT). It is important to note that not all people whoare questioning, especially young people, will later identify as LGBT.The PREA Standards do not use an acronym, but instead use the terms gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex.[17]The PREA Standards also use the term “gender nonconforming” to encompass “any person whose appearance or manner does notconform to traditional societal gender expectations.”[18]In this guide, the acronym LGBTI is used to refer to the whole community of  people who are sexual and gender minorities—lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex individuals. Additionally, the acronym LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,questioning, and intersex) is used in this guide to reflect the process of  questioning that often occurs in adolescence.The American Counseling Association “opposes the promotion of  ‘reparative’ therapy as a cure for individuals who arehomosexual.” The American Psychoanalytic Association believes that “[p]sychoanalytic technique does not encompasspurposeful efforts to ‘convert’ or ‘repair’ an individual’s sexual orientation.”[19]Core Principles for Understanding LGBTI Individuals in CustodyJust as corrections officials must develop an understanding of  core terms used by LGBTI people, there are also coreprinciples that can help officials better understand sexual orientation and gender identity. These core principles are based on well-developed research and principles developed by medical and mental health professionals.Awareness and Self-IdentificationResearch in the area of  adolescent development demonstrates that both sexual orientation and gender identity are establishedat a very early age.[20] The latest research shows that children are disclosing their sexual orientation to others at younger ages than inprevious generations.[21] Not all youth who have same-sex attractions, experiences, or relationships self-identify as lesbian, gay, orbisexual.[22] For some, it can take many years to understand and become comfortable with their identities, and some people do notcome out until much later in their lives.[23]Substantial research indicates that gender identity is “hard-wired”. Do not assume the child or youth is confused abouttheir gender identity. They most likely are not. This is not about current or future sexual orientation. Sexual Orientationis unrelated to Gender Identity.[24]Do No Harm: The Necessity of  Medical and Mental Health CareHealth professionals agree that a person’s gender identity is an ingrained and inherent part of  his or her overall identity, andattempts to change it will be ineffective and could potentially cause significant harm.[25] Even though some people may choose notto act on their feelings or do not self-identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, individuals with same-sex attractions cannot change theirsexual orientation.[26]Objective scientific research demonstrates that lesbian, gay, and bisexual identities fall within the range of  normal sexualdevelopment and are not associated with mental disorders or emotional or social problems,[27] and they are not the result of  priorsexual abuse or any other trauma.[28] In addition, numerous studies over the past 20 years have found that transgender individualsdo not have serious underlying psychopathologies that cause or influence their transgender identities and that the number oftransgender people with reported psychiatric problems mirrors that in the general population.[29]The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH)[30] has issued internationally accepted protocols forthe treatment of  youth and adults with gender dysphoria.[31] Treatment focuses on supporting a person’s understanding of  his orher gender and is highly personalized, based on individual needs.[32] Treatment can include a combination of  counseling, hormonetherapy, or surgeries as well as encouraging gender expression and gender identification.[33] Disrespecting, punishing, or prohibitingtransgender people from expressing their gender identity can lead to depression, suicide attempts, and problems with relationships,school, and work.[34]Medical experts do not view transitional treatments for transgender people as dangerous or experimental.[35] Both theAmerican Medical Association (AMA) and the American Psychological Association (APA) agree that these transition-relatedtreatments are effective and medically necessary for individuals who have been appropriately evaluated.[36] Medical organizationsfurther recognize and support the need for transgender-specific care in custodial settings.[37]The National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) adopted a position statement that provides guidanceto health professionals who work in correctional settings about their responsibility to ensure the physical and mentalhealth of  transgender people in custody. According to NCCHC, the proper approach to transgender medical care is tofollow the World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of  Care, ensuring that transgender peoplewho live in institutional settings have access to the same medical treatments that would be available to them in thecommunity. NCCHC also discourages a “freeze” or halting of  treatment regimes for transgender people when theycome into custody, and instead recommends that treatments remain dynamic depending on current medicalrecommendations.[38]Emerging Data on LGBTI Individuals in Custodial Settings and the ChallengesThey FaceIndividuals who are (or who are perceived to be) LGBTI are a presence in jails, prisons, juvenile facilities, communitycorrections facilities, and immigration detention facilities. A 2008 study conducted by the Bureau of  Justice Statistics (BJS) foundthat 8 percent of  the prison inmates surveyed identified a sexual orientation other than heterosexual (114,300 out of  1,430,300surveyed inmates of  federal and state prisons).[39] Recently, a BJS survey of  juvenile facilities found that more than 12 percent ofyouth self-identified as nonheterosexual.[40]LGBTI Individuals in Custodial SettingsLGBTI individuals are at significant risk for contact with the justice or correctional system. Although the social climate forLGBTI people has improved significantly over the past few decades, LGBTQI youth and adults continue to face hostility anddiscrimination in their homes, schools, workplaces, communities, and social service settings. As a result, LGBTI people may not haveaccess to support networks to help prevent them becoming involved in the criminal justice system.Studies of  LGBTQI youth in school settings reveal that they experience a higher frequency of  verbal harassment and physicalassault than their heterosexual counterparts.[41] Reports of  physical violence include individuals’ clothes being forcibly removed,gang rape,[42] and even death.[43] LGBTQI youth often face these challenges not only at school but also in their homes andcommunities.[44] Family rejection and school failure can lead to other problems, including homelessness,[45] involvement in the sexindustry,[46] psychological problems,[47] and self-medication with alcohol and drugs.[48] Consequently, LGBTI people may havedisproportionate contact with the criminal justice system that may begin, for some, in adolescence and continue into adulthood.[49]Furthermore, LGBTI identity can sometimes overwhelm companion issues of  poverty and race. A study conducted by theNational Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality found that transgender individuals were 4times more likely to live in extreme poverty.[50] Individuals living in poverty have a substantially higher rate of  involvement with thejuvenile and criminal justice systems. These issues are exacerbated for LGBTI people of  color, who are already disproportionatelypoor and may be detained by law enforcement because of  their race.[51]What the Data IllustrateLGBTI individuals who have contact with the juvenile or adult justice system often experience a number of  serious challengesthat begin at arrest and continue through release. These issues include abusive and demeaning contact with criminal justice officials;being inappropriately classified and housed; lack of  access to resources, including medical and mental health care; and abusivetreatment (verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual) from other inmates and staff.Recent research efforts have focused on the incidence of  sexual violence against LGBTI individuals in custody. Research andtestimony about the vulnerability of  those who are, or are perceived to be, LGBTI animated the passage of  PREA in 2003. Evenprior to PREA’s passage, research on sexual abuse in correctional facilities consistently documented that men and women withnonheterosexual orientations, transgender individuals, and people with intersex conditions were highly vulnerable to sexual abuse.[52]The NPREC proposed Standards to address prison rape on June 23, 2009;[53] compliance indicators were included to addressthe specific vulnerability of  LGBTI populations based on the finding that “certain individuals are more at risk of  sexual abuse thanothers.”[54] In particular, the NPREC found that “corrections administrators need to do more to identify those who are vulnerableand protect them in ways that do not leave them isolated and without access to rehabilitative programming.”[55]Research conducted by BJS pursuant to its mandate underPREA supports the NPREC’s findings and earlier research onthe prevalence of  sexual abuse in custodial settings.[56] The BJSsurvey of  youth in juvenile facilities found that more than 1 in 5nonheterosexual youth reported sexual victimization involvinganother youth or a facility staff  member, whereas slightly morethan 1 in 10 heterosexual youth reported sexual victimization.[57] The same study found that nonheterosexual youth werealmost 10 times more likely than heterosexual youth to reportthey had been sexually abused by other youth while in custody(12.5 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively).A 2008 BJS study of  federal and state prisoners foundthat among 1,316,000 heterosexual inmates, only 1.3 percentreported sexual victimization at the hands of  another inmateand 2.5 percent reported victimization by a staff  member.[58]Among 114,300 inmates with a non-heterosexual orientation,11.2 percent reported sexual victimization perpetrated by another inmate and 6.6 percent reported sexual victimization by a staffmember.[59]Other data illustrate that transgender women and girls are highly vulnerable to sexual abuse, especially when housed infacilities for men or boys.[60] The University of  California’s Center for Evidence-Based Corrections found that “[s]exual assault is 13times more prevalent among transgender inmates, with 59 percent reporting being sexually assaulted.”[61] In this study, transgendervictims were also far more likely than other victims to have been sexually assaulted on multiple occasions.[62] Such findings makeclear that “[e]ven when compared to other relatively vulnerable populations, transgender people are perilously situated.”[63] Becauseof  this concern, the APA and the NCCHC have both issued statements recognizing that transgender inmates are at especially highrisk of  abuse and calling for their protection.[64]“In matters of  housing, recreation, and work assignments, custody staff  should be aware that transgender people arecommon targets for violence. Accordingly, appropriate safety measures should be taken regardless of  whether theIf  an independent medical analysis and a riskassessment are not conducted, inmates’safety, security, or programming needs maybe at risk; this also could risk the safety andsecurity of  other inmates and staff.person is placed in male or female housing areas.”[65]A number of  successful lawsuits have been filed by transgender inmates against the Federal Bureau of  Prisons, statedepartments of  corrections, and local jails across the country. In recent years, federal courts have issued decisions inevery circuit as well as the U.S. Supreme Court. These cases involve allegations of  inadequate health care, deliberateindifference to abuse, and other forms of  mistreatment. For example, in 2003 the Fourth Circuit found that the VirginiaDepartment of  Corrections (VADOC) was required to continue to provide hormone therapy to Ophelia De’Lonta, atransgender inmate in their custody. De’Lonta was engaged in litigation with the VADOC, seeking a state-funded sexreassignment surgery, when the State of  Virginia granted her parole. As a result of  Ms. De’Lonta’s release, the court didnot decide whether sex reassignment surgery was medically necessary and thus required by the Constitution.[66]Risk, Housing, and ClassificationBecause there are no specific policies to provide guidance for correctional staff  on exercising appropriate judgment for riskassessment and placement of  LGBTI inmates, these inmates are most often placed or housed according to their genitalia or sexassigned at birth. If  an independent medical analysis and a risk assessment are not conducted, inmates’ safety, security, orprogramming needs may be at risk; this also could risk the safety and security of  other inmates and staff.[67] This is an issue in bothadult and juvenile settings, where LGBTQI youth can face denial of  access to health care, inappropriate housing, and punishmentfor expressing their gender.[68]Placement based on biology particularly impacts transgender women placed in men’s facilities. The NPREC found thattransgender women housed with men are “at extremely high risk for abuse.”[69] These women report verbal harassment, abusivestrip searches, sexual assault, long-term administrative detention, and denials of  program participation.[70] The NPREC found that“research on sexual abuse in correctional facilities consistently documents the vulnerability of  … transgender individuals.”[71]LGBTI inmates also report that agency staff  single out transgender people for abuse and have ignored or encouraged abuse by otherinmates.[72] Although little research exists on inmates with intersex conditions, NPREC findings show that this group is vulnerableto sexual abuse.[73] PREA Standards incorporate special measures to protect both transgender and intersex inmates.[74] Whenindividuals enter custody, authorities must make important decisions about risk, housing, and classification; such decisions are oftenmade on the basis of  gender. Because LGBTI inmates are gender nonconforming, this presents challenges at the outset.Corrections officials are aware of  the particular vulnerabilities LGBTIindividuals face; many facilities house LGBTI populations in administrativesegregation or special population units.[75] These options, although oftenbased on a desire to protect vulnerable inmates from sexual harassment orassault, are effective for brief  periods of  time but have proven unworkable fora myriad of  reasons. The PREA Standards provide that “[i]nmates at high riskfor sexual victimization shall not be placed in involuntary segregated housingunless an assessment of  all available alternatives has been made, and adetermination has been made that there is no available alternative means of  separation from likely abusers.”[76]Administrative segregation, and the ensuing isolation from the general population for purposes of  “safety,” often exacerbatesmental health conditions such as depression or gender dysphoria. In addition, isolation from the general population often meanslimited or no access to programming, regular visitation, or health care, all of  which are necessary for LGBTI populations. Likewise,data suggest that special population units (such as those on Rikers Island and the San Francisco County Jail) have not kept inmateswho identify as LGBTI any safer.[77]LGBTQI youth have experiences that are similar to their adult counterparts. A study by the Equity Project documented theexperiences of  LGBTQI youth, finding that these youth in juvenile justice facilities were often labeled sexual predators, isolated fromother youth, singled out, or even sent to sex offender programs. Youth were also denied access to education or group activitiesbecause staff  lacked the capacity and skills to protect them from serious acts of  physical, sexual, or verbal abuse.[78] LGBTQI youthwere often placed in protective custody or administrative segregation, where they were confined to their cells for up to 23 hours aday.[79] These experiences and conditions put LGBTQI youth at risk for other mental health issues such as depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse, and suicide.[80]Based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity, LGBTQI youth may be subjected to physical,sexual, and emotional abuse at the hands of  other youth as well as facility staff  members.Staff  may treat LGBTQI youth disrespectfully and unfairly, or they may punish and ridicule youth because of  theiractual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.LGBTQI youth may also be segregated as a means of  protecting them from abuse or based on an unfounded fear thatthey will prey on others in a sexual manner.[81]Endnotes[1] See,Crime and Justice Institute and National Institute of  Corrections, Implementing Evidence Based Policy and Practice in CommunityCorrections, 2nd ed.

LGBTQI YouthChapter 2. LGBTQI Youth under Custodial SupervisionMany corrections professionals are unaware that the youth they work with identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,questioning, and intersex (LGBTQI), and many juvenile justice agencies do not have policies nor do they provide training for theirstaff  that pertains to LGBTQI youth. Research shows that LGBTQI youth represent as much as 15 percent of  the total populationof  adjudicated youth.[82] Secure detention facilities can be particularly dangerous and hostile places for LGBTQI youth. Withoutpolicies and training, staff  are unprepared to provide safe and professional care to this population. Transgender youth and youthwith intersex conditions face additional challenges in detention because of  housing and medical care.As other detained youth, transgender and intersex youth are generally placed in sex-segregated facilities according to externalgenitalia rather than gender identity.[83] When transgender girls or girls with intersex conditions are placed in facilities for boys, theyare at very high risk for physical and sexual abuse by other youth and staff. In addition, some facilities do not provide transgenderyouth with medically necessary, transition-related health care.[84] Appropriate policies and procedures as well as staff  training,however, can better equip agencies to make decisions that are balanced regarding both the safety of  LGBTQI youth and the agencyas a whole.Appropriate policies and procedures as well as staff  training, however, can better equip agencies to make decisions that arebalanced regarding both the safety of  LGBTQI youth and the agency as a whole.A school district in Maine made accommodations for a young trans-girl attending public school, which allowed her touse the female restroom. When the school attempted to change its policy, to disallow the trans-girl’s use of  the femalerestroom, the resulting court case found that barring her access to the bathroom simply because the student wastransgender was a violation of  the state’s human rights law.[85]LGBTQI youth in the juvenile justice system have established rights under the U.S. Constitution, state and federal statutesand regulations, and through court precedent. Understanding these rights can help juvenile justice agencies and staff  developappropriate policies and procedures for working with LGBTQI youth and provide for their safety and rehabilitation.Constitutional LawThe U.S. Constitution extends critical rights to all detained youth. Juvenile justice agencies have an enhanced responsibility toensure that youth in their custody are safe and free from unreasonably restrictive conditions of  confinement.[86] Youth in juvenilejustice settings are entitled to more protection than incarcerated adults, and courts use the 14th Amendment due process clause toanalyze conditions of  confinement claims.[87] Under the 14th Amendment, juvenile facilities are required to provide all youth intheir custody with reasonable conditions of  confinement and freedom from unreasonable bodily restraint, and to protect their rightto be free from abuse and to receive adequate health care and fair and nondiscriminatory treatment.[88] Finally, confined youthmaintain their right to freedom of  expression and freedom of  religion under the 1st Amendment. In 2006, an important piece oflitigation exposed a pattern and practice of  sexual and physical victimization of  LGBTQI youth confined in the Hawaii YouthCorrectional Facility (HYCF). In R.G. v. Koller, three LGBTQI youth filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District ofHawaii, challenging the failure of  facility staff  to protect them from physical, emotional, and sexual abuse by other youth.[89]Ultimately, the court found that there was a pervasive climate of  hostility toward, discrimination against, and harassment of  youthbased on their actual or perceived sexual orientation, sex, or transgender status. The court also found that acts of  religiouspreaching by staff  were content based and presented a discriminatory viewpoint that silenced the youth’s speech regarding theirlives as LGBTQI teenagers, their feelings, and their important relationships.[90]In R.G. v. Koller, the court found that the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility:Failed to protect the plaintiffs from physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.Used isolation as a means to protect LGBT youth from abuse.Failed to provide the policies and training necessary to protect LGBT youth.All youth under supervision have a right to befree from unreasonably restrictive conditionsof  confinement, including isolation.Did not have adequate staffing and supervision or a functioning grievance system.Failed to use a classification system that protects vulnerable youth.[91]Freedom from AbuseCorrectional administrators have a legal responsibility to ensure that staff  members intervene promptly to protect the safetyof  residents.[92] If  staff  members are aware that a youth is being subjected to harassment or abuse, they must respond withappropriate actions designed to stop the harassment or abuse, especially if  the targeted youth is known to be vulnerable because heor she is young, has a mental illness, is openly LGBTQI, or is perceived to be LGBTQI.[93] For that reason, agencies should have asound classification system that prevents the placement of  vulnerable youth (such as LGBTQI youth) with aggressive youth whomay be abusive.[94]Freedom from IsolationAll youth under supervision have a right to be free from unreasonably restrictive conditions of  confinement, includingisolation. Numerous courts have concluded that the use of  administrative segregation or isolation in juvenile settings—even forshort periods of  time—is cruel, harmful, and unconstitutional.[95] Facilities and staff  may violate this constitutional right if  theyplace LGBTQI youth in isolation, either as punishment for expressing their identity or based on the myth that LGBTQI youth aresexually aggressive or a danger to other youth.[96] Placing all LGBTQI youth in segregation or isolation to protect them fromabuse[97] or using isolation to separate LGBTQI youth from their abuser(s)[98] also violates a youth’s constitutional rights.As one court has explained it, placing youth in isolation in response toan incident of  abuse is akin to “attempting ... to remedy one harm with anindefensible and unconstitutional solution.” Although an LGBTQI youth maybe at risk of  violence in a juvenile facility, the Constitution requires a moreeffective and less stigmatizing response than isolation.[99]Staff  should not treat LGBTQI youth as sex offenders, house them with sex offenders, or send them to sex offendertreatment programs because of  their gender identity or sexual orientation.[100] Facilities may violate youth’s constitutional rights bylabeling or treating LGBTQI youth as sex offenders or housing them with sex offenders without adequate due process protectionssuch as a hearing, an evaluation by a qualified mental health professional, and an opportunity to appeal the designation orplacement.The Right to Adequate Medical CareAll detained youth have a right to receive adequate medical and mental health care,[101] including health care that may beunique to that youth.[102] Agencies should provide appropriate medical and mental health care to transgender youth who arediagnosed with gender dysphoria, including access to medical providers with specific experience in evaluating and treating genderdysphoria in adolescents. In the adult context, courts have found that “transsexualism” constitutes a “serious medical need”;therefore, deliberately denying access to transgender-related health care amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.[103] Given theapplicable legal standard for youth, agencies must provide appropriate care to address youth’s medical and mental health needs withregard to gender identity.Health care shall:“respect and protect the civil and legal rights of  all individuals.”“refrain from discriminating against any individual because of  race, gender, creed, national origin, religiousaffiliation, age, disability, or any other type of  prohibited discrimination.”“respect, promote, and contribute to a workplace that is safe, healthy, and free of  harassment in any form.”[104]Freedom of  Speech and ExpressionAll youth have a constitutional right to freedom of  speech and freedom of  expression, which includes the right to be openabout one’s sexual orientation[105] and the right to express one’s gender through clothing and grooming practices.[106] Becauseyouth in custodial settings are still meeting adolescent development markers, it may be harmful to youth’s development to requirethem to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity. Policies that do not allow youth—especially gender-nonconforming youth—to express their gender through clothing and accessories can be counterproductive to normal adolescent development.[107] Inparticular, self-expression through clothes and grooming is a normal part of  adolescent development, and juvenile justice agenciesshould consider this when developing policies that are rigid regarding clothing and grooming practices. Safety of  all youth isparamount, but safety is not necessarily inconsistent with allowing youth to express themselves through clothing and grooming,when appropriate.The Right to Religious FreedomThe 1st Amendment guarantees youth in juvenile facilities the right to religious freedom and the right to be free fromreligious indoctrination.[108] Juvenile justice agencies that require LGBTQI youth to hide their identities or participate in religiousactivities that they object to, that condemn homosexuality and gender differences, or that try to convert LGBTQI youth may violateyouth’s 1st Amendment rights. Additionally, staff  members who intimidate or coerce LGBTQI youth into adopting a particularreligious practice or belief  also violate the 1st Amendment.[109]Reparative TherapiesChurches and other religious groups have routinely engaged in the practice of  conversion therapy in an attempt to change anindividual’s sexual attraction from homosexual to heterosexual.[110] In 2012, one of  the largest and most prominent of  theseconversion groups, Exodus International, announced that it would no longer practice or promote conversion therapy.[111] Toexplain the group’s disassociation from conversion therapy, Alan Chambers (president of  Exodus International) stated that “‘99.9percent’ of  the people he had met through Exodus International either had not changed their sexual attraction or still struggledwith temptation.”[112]To further acknowledge the ineffectiveness of  conversion therapy, California became the first state to ban sexual orientationchange efforts for minors. The California law states that “[u]nder no circumstances shall a mental health provider engage in sexualorientation change efforts with a patient under 18 years of  age.”[113] The law further states that any effort to change sexualorientation “by a mental health provider shall be considered unprofessional conduct and shall subject a mental health provider todiscipline by the licensing entity for that mental health provider.”[114] Mental health professionals challenged this law onconstitutional grounds in two separate cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  California; the presiding judgesreached opposite conclusions.[115] The Ninth Circuit resolved this issue in 2014, determining that such statutes should be subjectto the rational basis level of  scrutiny.[116]National Prison Rape Elimination Act StandardsPREA requires juvenile justice agencies to screen youth for risk of  sexual victimization and abusiveness. At a minimum, theintake screening must ascertain any gender-nonconforming appearance and consider whether the resident is or is perceived to beLGBTQI,[117] the youth’s perception of  his or her own vulnerability,[118] and any additional information that “may indicateheightened needs for supervision, additional safety precautions, or separation from certain other residents.”[119] The facility shallnot place LGBTQI youth “in particular housing, bed, or other assignments solely on the basis of  such identification or status” norconsider LGBTQI status “as an indicator of  likelihood of  being sexually abusive.”[120]In deciding whether to assign a transgender or intersex youth to a particular facility for male or female residents, and inmaking other housing and programming assignments, the agency should consider—on a case-by-case basis—whether a placementwould ensure the youth’s health and safety and whether the placement would present management or security problems. Thetransgender or intersex youth’s “own view with respect to his or her own safety shall be given serious consideration.”[121] Lastly,transgender and intersex youth must be able to use the toilet and shower separately from other residents.[122] Agencies mustreassess these placement and programming assignments for transgender and intersex youth at least twice per year.[123] If  a youth isisolated due to the risk of  sexual victimization or abusiveness, the facility must document the basis for its concern for the youth’ssafety and provide the reasons why “no alternative means of  separation can be arranged.”[124] Every 30 days, the facility mustreview each isolated youth’s situation to determine whether the need for continued separation from the general population persists.[125]A juvenile agency is not permitted to “search or physically examine a transgender or intersex resident for the sole purpose ofdetermining the resident’s genital status.” A resident’s genital status can only be ascertained “during conversations with the resident,by reviewing medical records, or, if  necessary, by learning that information as part of  a broader medical examination conducted inprivate by a medical practitioner.”[126] Furthermore, the agency must train staff  to conduct cross-gender searches and searches oftransgender and intersex residents in a “professional and respectful manner, and in the least intrusive manner possible, consistentwith security needs.”[127]Finally, the PREA Standards provide guidance for agencies on staff  training, investigations, and data collection with regard toLGBTQI residents. Each agency must train employees who may have contact with youth to communicate effectively andprofessionally with those who identify as LGBTQI.[128] Agencies are permitted to prohibit all sexual activity but may not “deemsuch activity to constitute sexual abuse if  it determines that the activity is not coerced.”[129] When conducting incident reviews ofabusive sexual acts, the agency must “[c]onsider whether the incident or allegation was motivated by ... gender identity; lesbian, gay,bisexual, transgender, or intersex identification, status, or perceived status ... or was motivated or otherwise caused by other groupdynamics at the facility.”[130]Other Governing Principles: State Human Rights Law and Professional Codesof  EthicsIn addition to the protections provided by the U.S. Constitution, some states also have statutes or regulations that prohibitdiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity or expression in juvenile justice facilities. State laws that provideprotection for LGBTQI youth in custody include (1) nondiscrimination laws specific to juvenile facilities or state-funded programs,(2) nondiscrimination laws for people in institutional settings, (3) public accommodation laws, and (4) housing laws.[131]Codes of  ethics of  the American Correctional Association (ACA) and the National Partnership for Juvenile Services (NPJS)outline the responsibilities that juvenile justice professionals owe to all youth in their care, including LGBTQI youth.[132] TheNPJS Code of  Ethics requires juvenile detention workers to: “(1) advocate for policies that ensure the legal and human rights ofjustice-involved youth; (2) educate justice-involved youth, professionals and others about policies and practices that either promoteor violate these rights; (3) refuse to remain silent when these rights are violated, and they speak on behalf  of  the affected youths;and (4) support the rights of  justice-involved youth to be served in a psychologically and physically safe and secureenvironment.”[133]Elements of  Legally Sound and Effective Policy and PracticeAll LGBTQI policies should be based on the following guiding principles:[134]Respectful interactions among youth and between staff  and youth.Do no harm.Safety of  youth who are vulnerable.Targeted to your legal obligations and what staff  are required to do by law.In addition, all LGBTQI policies should include the following elements:Statement of  purpose.Enumeration of  included groups.Prohibitions.Requirements.Scope of  applicability.Definitions.Responsibilities.Enforcement and sanctions (for both staff  and youth).Training and dissemination methods.The following areas should be addressed when developing, revising, or implementing facility policies to ensure the safety ofLGBTQI youth in custodial settings:Nondiscrimination.Intake.Risk assessment.Classification.Communication.Medical care.Mental health care.Privacy.Safety.These areas are discussed in greater detail below. Each section includes a discussion of  the purpose for adopting a specificpolicy and a list of  questions to consider when drafting or revising policies and procedures. Policies should fill the gap betweenwhat is required under the law and what should be done as good correctional practice. Appendix D includes examples of  agencypolicies that address some of  these issues.Nondiscrimination PoliciesJuvenile justice agencies should develop, adopt, and enforce policies that include zero tolerance for discrimination andmistreatment of  youth and staff  that results from actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. Thesepolicies should specifically prohibit harassment and abuse of  youth and staff  by staff  or other youth.Following are questions to ask about an agency’s nondiscrimination policy:NondiscriminationPolicy Checklist YES NODoes the agency have anondiscrimination policy foryouth, employees, orvolunteers?  Does the agency policyrequire that all individuals whoenter the agency are treatedwith fairness, dignity, andrespect regardless of  real orperceived sexual orientation?  Does the agency policyexplicitly list sexual orientationand gender identity orexpression as prohibited basesfor discrimination?  Does the agency policyprohibit attempts by staff  toridicule or change a youth’ssexual orientation or genderidentity?  Does the agency policydefine staff  duty to provide safeand healthy environments inwhich all individuals are treatedwith respect and dignity?  Does the agency policydefine staff  responsibility forprotecting the civil rights ofLGBTQI youth while incustody, and for ensuring theirphysical and emotional well-being and safety in juvenilefacilities?  Does the agency policydefine the elements of  incidentreporting to include complaintsof  harassment, discrimination,and abuse?  Does the agency policyprovide training and resourcesregarding the societal, familial,and developmental challengesconfronting LGBTQI youth?  Does the agency policyaddress the collection andanalysis of  data regarding theneeds of  LGBTQI youth in itscustody?   If  the answer to most of  these questions is “yes,” it is likely that the agency is close to being in line with federal and state lawsand regulations as well as constitutional provisions for LGBTQI youth. If  the answer to even some of  these questions is “no,” itmay indicate that the agency has some work to do in this area, and a policy revision based on the legal rights outlined above and inthe PREA Standards is in order. Download LGBTQI Youth under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Intake, Risk Assessment, and ClassificationIntake and Risk AssessmentIdentifying safety concerns for LGBTQI youth is a priority in determining risk. Agencies should develop and implementintake processes to identify LGBTQI youth and those perceived to be LGBTQI who are vulnerable to physical and sexual assault.Following are questions to ask about an agency’s intake and risk assessment policy and practice:Intake and Risk Assessment PolicyChecklistYES NODuring intake and initial classification,does the agency ascertain information aboutthe youth’s sexual orientation and/or genderidentity?  During the youth’s confinement, doesthe agency periodically update informationregarding the youth’s sexual orientation andgender identity?  Do the agency employees who   conduct initial screening and classificationreceive training regarding sensitivity inconducting interviews with LGBTQI youth?Does the agency policy require that ayouth’s sexual orientation and/or genderidentity be verified by multiple sources priorto classification?  Are medical health practitioners theonly staff  permitted to physically examineyouth to gather information about genderidentity?[135]  Does the agency policy have a processto document and accommodate theconcerns of  LGBTQI youth in terms ofsafety, name, pronoun, toileting, showering,and searches?  Do the agency medical and mentalhealth staff  use screening tools that aredeveloped specifically for LGBTQI youth?  Does the agency provide all youth anorientation that discusses diversity anddescribes the harms that result from name-calling, bullying, and harassment?   If  the answer to even some of  these questions is “no,” the agency will need to rewrite its policy to be more in line with thePREA Standards that address risk assessment and screening. Risk assessment and screening are crucial to the safety of  LGBTQIyouth, especially when those are the tools and policies in place to inform housing options for youth in custody. All screening toolsshould include vulnerability assessments, the types of  housing decisions that can be made by staff, and a stipulation as to when anassessment requires moving a decision up the chain of  command. Housing and classification are key to ensuring the safety ofyouth.  Download LGBTQI Youth under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]ClassificationJuvenile facilities must have sound classification systems that separate vulnerable youth from aggressive youth. In classifyingyouth, facilities must not infringe on the youth’s right to be free from unreasonably restrictive conditions (such as isolation) andpractices that amount to punishment without due process (such as automatic placement based on gender identity). Facilities shoulduse all information obtained during intake to make all housing, bed, program, education, and work assignments for youth, with thegoal of  keeping all youth physically and emotionally safe.Following are questions to ask about an agency’s classification policy:Classification Policy Checklist YES NOIs the agency classification policybased on individualized needs that balancethe youth’s physical and emotional well-beingwith the safety of  all other youth?  Is the agency classification processobjective and free of  individual biases?  Is the agency classification processdefined in written policies and procedures?  Does the agency prohibit blanketpolicies regarding the classification ofLGBTQI youth or those perceived to beLGBTQI?  Does the agency classification policygovern the placement of  youth into sexoffender programs or units based onarticulated criteria, including orders of  thecourt?  Do the agency classification andhousing policy and procedures considerphysical layout and privacy issues whendetermining the location for LGBTQIyouth?  Does the agency place vulnerableyouth in the least restrictive environmentnecessary to ensure safety and provide theyouth with equal access to facility services?  Do the agency classification protocolsaddress how youth in various classificationsare housed if  the facility is crowded?  Do the agency classification andhousing protocols consider privacy concernswhen assigning housing for LGBTQI youth?  Does the agency develop responses toabuse or harassment (or threat of  abuse orharassment) of  LGBTQI youth that do not  rely on the isolation or segregation of  theseyouth?As discussed above, confined youth have the right to be free from unreasonably restrictive conditions[136] and conditions orpractices that amount to punishment.[137] Accordingly, instead of  isolating LGBTQI youth, facility staff  should implement moreeffective and fair safeguards such as “ensuring appropriate staff-to-resident ratios; modeling respectful behavior; providing closesupervision of  residents; promptly intervening to interrupt any disrespect, harassment, or abuse directed at other youth; andkeeping youth meaningfully engaged in constructive programming.”[138] It is also essential (for safety and security as well as mentalhealth care) that LGBTQI youth are not automatically treated as sex offenders, housed with sex offenders, or sent to sex offendertreatment programs simply because of  their gender identity or sexual orientation.[139]Agencies should make housing determinations based on a number of  factors, not based on LGBTQI status alone.[140]Additionally, agencies should not use youth’s self-identification as LGBTQI “as an indicator of  likelihood of  being sexually abusedor abusive.”[141] Download LGBTQI Youth under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Housing Specifications for Transgender and Intersex YouthDetermining gender-appropriate placements for transgender and intersex youth can be difficult. A handful of  juvenile justiceagencies have clearly written policies concerning housing placements for these youth.[142] Agencies should make determinationsfor housing these youth on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, PREA Standards advise agencies to make provisions for transgenderand intersex youth to use the toilet and shower separately.[143]Following are questions to ask about an agency’s classification policy for transgender and intersex youth:Classification for Transgender andIntersex Youth Policy ChecklistYES NODo the agency classification andhousing policies include evaluation of  aperson’s current genital status in makingplacement decisions?  Does the agency make individualizedhousing determinations based on otherfactors in addition to a person’s currentgenital status?  Do the agency classification andhousing policies include factors that relate tothe youth’s emotional and physical well-beingand that prioritize the youth’s evaluation ofhis or her safety?  Do the agency classification andhousing policies include a review of  youth’sprivacy concerns, available housing options,and recommendations from the youth’smental health providers regardingappropriate housing or classification?  Does or can the agency provide accessto private toilet and shower facilities, whennecessary, or a single room for sleeping,while allowing youth to have full access tothe facility’s daily programming?  Does or can the agency housetransgender youth according to genderidentity rather than birth sex?  When it is necessary, can the agencyplace transgender youth safely according tobirth sex and protect their physical andemotional well-being?  Can the agency safely housetransgender youth in a mixed-gender unit orprogram?  Does the agency determinereclassification needs based on requests byyouth or based on victimization?   Individualized decision-making is key in making appropriate and ultimately safe housing decisions for LGBTQI youth.Currently, some agencies have policies that specifically call for individualized placement decisions for transgender and intersexindividuals. Download LGBTQI Youth under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Respectful CommunicationAll policies for the safety and care of  LGBTQI youth include components of  respectful communication with and among allyouth. Staff  and volunteers should always be examples to youth, and should use respectful language and terminology that do notpromote stereotypes about LGBTQI people or convey bias or hatred toward them. Additional elements of  communication andharassment policies are inclusive language and attention to names and pronouns. If  professionals are unsure of  a youth’s genderidentity, they should simply ask the youth about it and about the pronoun and name the youth uses.Following are questions to ask about an agency’s respectful communication policy for youth:Respectful Communication withYouth Policy ChecklistYES NODoes the agency have a zero-tolerancepolicy for sexual harassment, includingharassment by staff  and youth-on-youthharassment?  Does the agency policy includedirection to staff  on how to addressLGBTQI youth using respectful andappropriate language?  If  the agency policy permits youth towear clothing other than issued clothing,does the agency policy permit youth toexpress themselves through clothing orgrooming (within the bounds of  safety forall youth)?  Does the agency policy addressconfidentiality of  information, includingstaff  disclosure relating to the privacy andconfidentiality of  LGBTQI youth?  Does the agency policy adhere to allconfidentiality and privacy protectionsafforded LGBTQI youth under applicablestate law?  Does the agency policy allow forsharing the information necessary to achievea particular purpose, such as identifying anappropriate placement in another facility?  Does the agency policy provide foreligible LGBTQI youth to accessprogramming and services within facilities?   Download LGBTQI Youth under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Juvenile agencies can allow youth to express their gender identity by giving them choices about clothing (includingundergarments), hairstyle, and personal grooming. Agencies should give males and females the ability to choose from availableclothing and grooming items (e.g., boxers or briefs, shaving supplies, and hair products). Allowing transgender youth to expresstheir gender identity through choice of  clothing (if  such a choice is available), name, hairstyle, and other means of  expression cancontribute to positive mental health.Confidentiality is a key component of  honest communication with LGBTQI youth. Some youth will freely reveal privateinformation to anyone who asks; others might not feel as comfortable discussing their identity, or they might want to keep it fromfriends or parents. Staff  should respect this and hold in confidence a youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity unless youth havegiven them permission to discuss it. This principle applies even in situations where staff  feel that revealing information about ayouth’s sexual orientation or gender identity is in the youth’s best interests. Doing so could immediately compromise a youth’s safetyin the facility and later compromise his or her safety at home or at school. Within the agency, any disclosure of  information relatedto a youth’s LGBTQI status should be limited to information necessary to achieve a specific beneficial purpose for that youth; inthese circumstances, the information should only be disclosed to individuals who have a need to know.Medical and Mental Health CareAt a minimum, policies on medical and mental health should provide all youth with access to quality medical care. LGBTQIyouth should have opportunities to receive counseling as well as medical health care that meets their unique needs. Agencies shouldnot attempt to change a youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity, punish youth for expressing their sexual orientation or genderidentity, or require youth to undergo sex offender counseling based solely on the youth’s sexual orientation or gender identity.Following are questions to ask about an agency’s medical and mental health care policy for LGBTQI youth:Medical and Mental Health CarePolicy ChecklistYES NODo the agency medical and mentalhealth protocols include opportunities forLGBTQI youth to access services thataddress self-acceptance and validation,concerns about disclosure of  sexualorientation or gender identity, familyrelationships, healthy intimate relationships,and sexual decision-making?  Does the agency policy promote thehiring of  medical and mental healthprofessionals who have expertise and/orexperience in working with LGBTQI youth?  In assessing a youth’s medical and/ormental health status, does the agency policydirect medical staff  to include an assessmentof  the youth’s safety?  Do the agency medical and mentalhealth protocols direct those conductingmedical screening to inquire about theyouth’s sexual activity, sexual orientation, andgender identity, both before and duringconfinement?  Do the agency medical protocolsprovide for gynecological and obstetricalcare?  Do the agency medical protocolsprovide for HIV and STD testing, care, andconfidentiality?  Do the agency medical and mentalhealth protocols provide for counseling forsexual trauma that occurred either before orduring confinement?  Do the agency medical and mentalhealth protocols provide for mental healthevaluations that include assessment of  anarray of  mental health diagnoses, includinggender dysphoria?  Do the agency medical protocolsaddress medical care for transgender youth,including evaluation of  their care prior toincarceration?   At a minimum, agencies should ensure that youth have access to medical providers who are knowledgeable about theparticular health needs of  LGBTQI youth—especially transgender youth and youth with intersex conditions. If  a transgender youthor a youth with intersex conditions requests an evaluation or treatment, facility staff  should provide the youth with access toappropriate professionals and should provide all medically necessary treatment recommended. If  the facility cannot providetreatment on site, then the youth should be transported to the provider. If  a transgender youth or a youth with an intersexcondition has been receiving medical or mental health services (such as hormone treatments) prior to arriving at the facility, thefacility should consult with the youth’s medical providers and continue to provide medically necessary treatment. Download LGBTQI Youth under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Privacy and SafetyFacilities should provide access to private bathrooms and showers (when necessary) or a single room for sleeping. Privacyaccommodations should not prevent LGBTQI youth from full integration into the facility's daily programming. In general, policiesthat are integral to addressing the safety and privacy issues and concerns of  LGBTQI youth include:Cross-gender supervision.Use of  facilities—bathrooms, showers, etc.Search procedures.Undressing.Following are questions to ask about an agency’s privacy and safety policy for youth:Privacy and Safety Policy Checklist YES NODoes the agency practice cross-gendersupervision of  youth? Explain your answer.  Does the agency policy address levelsof  staffing and supervision?  Does the agency policy address thesafety and privacy needs of  LGBTQI youthin regard to toileting, showering, andsleeping?  If  a strip search is necessary, dotransgender or intersex youth have theoption of  choosing the gender of  the staffperson that will conduct the search?  Does the agency policy address searchprocedures and privacy needs of  LGBTQIyouth?  Does the agency policy require thatyouth grievances be tracked, and does theagency collect and analyze information ongrievances related to searches?   To develop sound policy in these areas, facility administrators should focus on ways the facility can protect the privacy,dignity, and safety of  LGBTQI youth. Policies should avoid subjecting transgender youth to unnecessary risks of  physical andemotional harm. Facilities should act on a case-by-case basis and encourage staff  members to work with transgender youth todetermine the best solution for accessing the bathroom, showering, changing clothing, searches, and drug testing that protects theirprivacy, dignity, and safety. Download LGBTQI Youth under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Sexual Abuse of  LGBTQI YouthNot all sexual behaviors between youth in facilities can be categorized as sexual abuse. Many times, youth voluntarily engagein sexual activities. Exploring sexuality and sexual identity is a key component of  adolescent development. Therefore, agenciesshould have policies that require staff  to determine whether an incident of  sexual behavior between youth is sexual abuse or non-coercive voluntary sexual activity. Although voluntary sexual activity between youth may violate agency policies, it may not violatestate criminal laws and is not prohibited by the PREA Standards. However, it is important to recognize there is a continuumregarding youth’s engagement in sexual behavior while in custody. Sexual behavior between youth can be non-abusive or abusive;however, it can also be strategic (e.g., sex for trade) or coerced (e.g., sex for protection). On any given day, encounters can movealong the continuum—consensual one day and coercive the next. Therefore, agencies must recognize these elements of  sexualbehavior in custody and have policies that pay special attention to the fact that LGBTQI youth have increased vulnerability toabuse.Following are questions to ask about an agency’s sexual abuse policy for youth:Sexual Abuse Policy Checklist YES NODoes the agency policy prohibit thesexual abuse of  youth in custody?  Does the agency policy stipulate thatstaff  must receive training regarding thesexuality and sexual behaviors of  youth?  Does the agency policy require theinvestigation of  all reports of  violations of  policy regarding sexual abuse?Does the agency have multiplemethods for youth to report sexual abuse,including avenues for third-party,independent reporting?  Does the agency policy address thetreatment and management of  youth whoreport allegations of  sexual abuse?  Does the agency policy defineacceptable sexual behavior for youth andsanctions for violations?  Does the agency policy define theroles and responsibilities of  the investigativeprocess into allegations of  sexual abuse?  Does the agency policy (or theinvestigative entity’s policy) require referralof  allegations of  potential criminal activityfor review by the prosecutor?  Does the agency policy require areview of  reports and investigations ofsexual abuse?  Does the agency policy establish asexual assault response team (SART)?  Do the agency protocols provide forongoing medical and mental health care foryouth who have been sexually victimizedwhile in custody?  Does the agency policy recognizeparticularly vulnerable populations, such asLGBTQI youth, and identify their need fortreatment?

LGBTI AdultsChapter 3. LGBTI Adults under Custodial SupervisionSimilar to staff  in juvenile facilities, many adult correctional professionals are ill prepared to work withinmates who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI), and most agencies do nothave policies or provide training for staff  related to working with LGBTI inmates. Without essential policiesand training, staff  members are unprepared to provide safe and professional care to this population, especiallygiven the challenges that LGBTI inmates present in securing safe housing and medical and mental health care.The LawAs all other incarcerated individuals, those who identify as LGBTI and are held in adult facilities haverights under the U.S. Constitution and under state and federal statutes and regulations. Understanding howthese rights apply to LGBTI people can help criminal justice professionals develop policies and proceduresthat provide for the safety of  LGBTI people and can also help correctional agencies meet their legalobligations.Constitutional LawThe 8th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives citizens the right to be free from cruel and unusualpunishment, which includes safety and adequate medical care in correctional settings.[144] Additionally, theU.S. Constitution provides the right to receive nondiscriminatory treatment under the 5th and 14thAmendments, and limited rights to privacy under the due process clause. Individuals also retain limited rightsto freedom of  religion, expression, and association, even while incarcerated.Spreading rumors that a person is gay has been held to state a claim of  deliberate indifferenceunder the 8th Amendment because, “in the prison context … one can think of  few acts thatcould be more likely to lead to physical injury than spreading rumors of  homosexuality.”[145]8th Amendment Protections from Physical and Sexual AbuseCorrections agencies have a responsibility to protect inmates from abuse at the hands of  other inmatesand staff, including volunteers and contractors. Agency officials can be held liable under the 8th Amendment’scruel and unusual punishment clause if  they are deliberately indifferent and fail to protect inmates. In 1994, theU.S. Supreme Court held that it is unlawful for prison officials to be deliberately indifferent to the sexual abuseof  a transgender inmate who was repeatedly raped and beaten by other inmates.[146] The Court explained thatofficials are liable for abuse of  inmates when “the official knows of  and disregards an excessive risk to inmatehealth or safety.”[147] An excessive risk exists when an inmate belongs to “an identifiable group of  peoplewho are frequently singled out for violent attack by other inmates.”[148] Since that finding, numerous courtshave found that an inmate’s LGBTI status or gender nonconformity alone may be sufficient to put agencyofficials on notice of  that individual’s vulnerability and need for protection.[149] Failure to take adequateCorrections agencies have a responsibility toprotect inmates from abuse at the hands ofother inmates and staff, including volunteersand contractors.protective measures in the face of  this vulnerability can and generally does constitute deliberate indifference.[150] In 2004, the Sixth Circuit noted that “placing a transgender woman in protective custody with inmateswho have assaulted other inmates resulted in a substantial risk to her safety and could amount to deliberateindifference.”[151]Use of  Administrative Segregation for ProtectionAlthough it is permissible to place vulnerableinmates in administrative segregation in somecircumstances, agency officials will not be able to rely onthis measure as long-term protection for LGBTI inmates.Whether it violates the U.S. Constitution to placevulnerable inmates in administrative segregation depends on the purpose of  segregation, the availability ofalternatives to provide protection, the harshness or restrictiveness of  the conditions in segregation, theduration of  segregation, and whether the appropriateness of  segregation for a particular inmate is regularlyreviewed.[152] Agency officials may, however, segregate LGBTI inmates as a temporary measure when thereare specific circumstances, such as upon admission (while determining an appropriate long-term placement) orimmediately following an assault and during a pending investigation.[153]Medical Care for LGBTI InmatesOn multiple occasions, the U.S. Supreme Court found that deliberate indifference to a person’s seriousmedical needs violates the 8th Amendment.[154] An inmate is denied medical care when officials either refuseto provide medical care or are so incompetent that they fail to provide care, in effect. However, this does notsuggest that an LGBTI inmate is entitled to the care of  his or her choosing. Courts have recognized that thedenial of  “desired accommodations and medical treatment” does not violate inmates’ rights under the 8th or14th Amendment.[155] One example is the refusal to provide hormone therapy for transgender inmates. Onthe other hand, courts have recognized that transgender inmates with gender dysphoria have a serious medicalcondition and that failure to treat inmates with this condition is a violation of  the 8th Amendment.[156] Aswith any other medical condition, courts will generally defer to the medical staff ’s treatment choices, but onlyif  these choices result in treatments that are adequate and effective for a particular inmate’s gender dysphorianeeds.[157]Factors such as the length of  imprisonment and custody are also relevant. The treatment required in ashort-term jail or lockup will differ from that required in a prison. Medical care for inmates with genderdysphoria should be based on an individualized medical evaluation that determines what care is medicallynecessary for particular inmates. To meet this standard, correctional administrators should avoid policies thatonly permit prescribed treatments (such as psychotherapy or antidepressants) to treat gender dysphoria.Policies that specifically prohibit hormone therapy for inmates with gender dysphoria, especially those whowere not receiving hormones at the time of  incarceration, are not in accordance with the standards of  care forgender dysphoria.[158] A federal district court found that a prison may not adopt a “rigid, freeze-frame policy,”where inmates with gender dysphoria have access only to the specific treatments they received prior toincarceration.[159]Some courts have found that the harmful physiological and psychological effects stemming from thediscontinuation of  hormone therapy amount to deliberate indifference. Conversely, the U.S. District Court forthe Western District of  Texas has ruled that an inmate with gender identity disorder (GID) was not entitled toreceive hormone therapy, stating that the inmate’s “disagreement with the course of  treatment pursued byprison medical staff  does not constitute a viable claim for deliberate indifference to serious medical needsunder the 8th Amendment.”[160]Courts have found that correctional policies that restrict certain treatments for all inmates with genderdysphoria “irrespective of  an inmate’s serious medical need or the [prison medical professional’s] clinicaljudgment” are impermissible.[161] As one court explained, “there is no exception to [the 8th Amendment] forserious medical needs that are first diagnosed in prison.”[162] Additionally, if  the treatment prescribed after amedical evaluation is not consistent with the patient’s diagnosis, or when the evaluation is conducted bysomeone without appropriate knowledge of  gender dysphoria, inmates can challenge the adequacy of  themedical evaluation and treatment.[163]Court findings indicate that agencies may not deny treatment for inmates with gender dysphoria basedon a generalized or unsubstantiated security concern, or based on concerns that relate to the inmate’stransgender status or gender expression. When treatment would present a security risk, corrections officialsmust balance these concerns against the medical necessity of  the treatment.[164] Finally, medical treatmentmay not be denied to a person with gender dysphoria simply because it is expensive or because it might beunpopular or controversial to prescribe such treatment.[165]Agency officials can be held liable for deliberate indifference to a person’s serious medical need bydenying, delaying, or intentionally interfering with his or her medical treatment.[166]The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Wisconsin held that “a reasonable jury couldfind that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to Konitzer's serious medical need whenthey failed to provide [her] with the second step of  treatment from the standards of  care, the real-life experience…”[167]Gender Presentation and ExpressionDenying inmates with gender dysphoria the ability to fully adopt the gender role and presentationconsistent with their gender identities can constitute a denial of  necessary medical care and a violation of  the8th Amendment.[168]Another treatment frequently available for individuals with gender dysphoria is “Real LifeExperience.”[169] This treatment consists of  expressing the gender that is consistent with one’s gender identityin all aspects of  everyday life. Some courts have recognized that Real Life Experience is a legitimate and oftenessential form of  treatment for gender dysphoria in the correctional context and may at times be medicallynecessary and constitutionally required.[170] In contrast, the U.S. District Court of  Kansas has held that abiologically male inmate did not have a constitutional right to receive cosmetics and female clothing.[171]In Kosilek v. Maloney, the U.S. District Court for the District of  Massachusetts determined that Real LifeExperience was possible in prison, based on the testimony of  medical experts that prison is an inmate’s “reallife.”[172] In 2012, the same court found that prison officials had been deliberately indifferent to Kosilek’sserious medical need and ordered the Massachusetts Department of  Corrections to provide gender-reassignment surgery.[173] The First Circuit recently overturned this case, but the court found that reasonableminds would differ on these important medical determinations, leaving room for different findings on anotherset of  facts. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of  Virginia reached an opposite conclusion, rulingon summary judgment that Ophelia De’Lonta, a male to female transgender inmate, was not entitled tosurgical intervention to treat her severe GID.[174] The Fourth Circuit, however, reversed and remanded thelower court’s ruling, finding that De’Lonta is entitled to a hearing on the merits of  her case.[175]Searches and DiscriminationAgencies that permit conjugal visits may not prohibit conjugal visits for legally married same-sexcouples if  other married couples are provided opportunities for conjugal visits.[176]Correctional agencies may not prohibit visitsby same-sex partners or include restrictionson affection between individuals of  the samesex during visits where these samerestrictions do not apply to heterosexualcouples.Inmates in state prisons cannot be denied the right to marry someone of  the same sex if  marriagebetween same-sex individuals is legal in that state.[177]If  correctional officers target LGBTI people for unnecessarily public strip searches, it can violate therights of  inmates to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Some courts have found that inmates have aclearly established right “not to be subjected to a humiliating strip search in full view of  several (or perhapsmany) others unless the procedure is reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.”[178] In Meriwetherv. Faulkner, the Seventh Circuit held that a male-to-female transgender inmate stated a valid 8th Amendmentclaim, where a correctional officer repeatedly demanded that the inmate strip in front of  inmates and otherofficers for the sole purpose of  viewing her body.[179] The court found this was sufficient to state an 8thAmendment claim because the searches were “maliciously motivated” and not related to security matters.[180]Courts have found that discrimination in providing services and privileges based on sexual orientation isa violation of  constitutionally held rights. For example, correctional agencies may not prohibit visits by same-sex partners or include restrictions on affection between individuals of  the same sex during visits where thesesame restrictions do not apply to heterosexual couples.Courts have also ordered agencies to stop enforcing policies that prohibit visitation by same-sexpartners of  inmates. Denying such visits for the purposes of  security is not constitutional.[181] Similarly, theNinth Circuit denied a prison’s motion to dismiss in a challenge to a state’s complete ban on same-sex huggingand kissing among inmates and visitors who were not blood related, rejecting the contention that the policybore a “common-sense” relation to prison security.[182] Some state departments of  corrections, including theCalifornia Department of  Corrections and Rehabilitation, have opted to extend conjugal visits to registereddomestic partners.[183] Some agencies, however, retain policies that limit conjugal visits to legally marriedinmates.[184]Courts have also prohibited other forms ofdiscrimination. Agencies cannot deny LGBTI peoplepermission to attend religious services because of  theirsexual orientation,[185] nor can they fire or refuse to hireeligible inmates based solely on their sexual orientation.[186] Similarly, agencies cannot punish inmates becauseof  their sexual orientation.[187]Confidentiality and Disclosure of  MedicalInformationThe constitutional right to privacy protects information concerning an inmate’s sexual orientation, andcorrectional officers may not arbitrarily disclose this information. Courts have recognized a similarly strongprivacy interest in disclosure of  one’s sexual orientation. Courts have clearly recognized that, even in thecorrectional context, a person has a “particularly compelling” constitutional privacy interest in certain highlypersonal information, including one’s transgender identity or HIV status,[188] and disclosing such informationwithout a legitimate penological reason is unconstitutional.[189]In Powell v. Shriver, a transgender woman housed in a women’s prison was casually “out-ed” astransgender and HIV-positive by staff, which led to a pattern of  harassment by staff  and inmatesand violated her right to privacy. In that case, the Second Circuit specifically acknowledged the“excruciatingly private and intimate nature of  transsexualism” and that such disclosure may putinmates at heightened risk of  abuse; the court found that the disclosure violated privacy rights ofinmates.[190]Access to Materials with LGBTI ContentProviding access to LGBTI materials is often covered by the 1st Amendment. Courts find that agenciesmay restrict an inmate’s right to receive publications that may cause a threat to the daily operation of  a facility,[191] but restrictions are limited to publications that would potentially interfere with security, order, ordiscipline. Agencies may not prohibit material solely because it contains LGBTI content; they can, however,generally prohibit sexually explicit materials.[192] A publication that discusses LGBTI issues or sexualorientation is not necessarily sexually explicit; agencies must have other reasons for excluding such content.National Prison Rape Elimination Act StandardsThe final PREA Standards include specific provisions for LGBTI and gender-nonconforming inmatesaccording to facility type. Each correctional setting offers a varying degree of  protection for LGBTI inmates.These are the minimum standards that must be met to be compliant with PREA. However, agencies can andshould develop policies and practices that take into account the needs of  LGBTI populations in their ownfacility.Adult Prisons and JailsThe final PREA Standards require adult prisons and jails to conduct an intake screening within 72 hoursof  an inmate’s arrival to assess that inmate’s risk for sexual victimization or abuse. Specifically, the Standardsprovide that “the intake screening shall consider, at a minimum … whether the inmate is or is perceived to begay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, or gender nonconforming.”[193] Furthermore, “an inmate’s risklevel shall be reassessed when warranted due to a referral, request, incident of  sexual abuse, or receipt ofadditional information that bears on the inmate’s risk of  sexual victimization or abusiveness.”[194] Inmatesmay not be disciplined for refusal to answer or failure to disclose complete information in response toquestions regarding sexual orientation. Importantly, an agency may not place LGBTI inmates in “dedicatedfacilities, units, or wings solely on the basis of  such identification or status”[195] unless that placement isconsistent with an existing consent decree, legal settlement, or legal judgment.[196]The PREA Standards also include protections specific to transgender and intersex inmates. First, theyindicate that, “in deciding whether to assign a transgender or intersex inmate to a facility for male or femaleinmates, and in making other housing and programming assignments, the agency shall consider on a case-bycase basis whether a placement would ensure the inmate’s health and safety, and whether the placement wouldpresent management or security problems.”[197] The “inmate’s own view with respect to his or her own safetyshall be given serious consideration.”[198] Finally, transgender and intersex inmates must be able to use thetoilet and shower separately from other inmates. Agencies must assess placement and programmingassignments for transgender and intersex inmates at least twice per year.[199]The PREA Standards also place limits on cross-gender viewing and searches. Agencies may not “searchor physically examine a transgender or intersex inmate for the sole purpose of  determining the inmate’s genitalstatus.”[200] The facility is permitted to determine an inmate’s genital status “during conversations with theinmate, by reviewing medical records, or, if  necessary, by learning that information as part of  a broadermedical examination conducted in private by a medical practitioner.”[201] The agency must train its staff  inhow to conduct cross-gender searches and searches of  transgender and intersex people “in a professional andrespectful manner, and in the least intrusive manner possible, consistent with security needs.”[202]The Standards provide guidance for agency staff  on employee training, investigation of  sexual activity,and data collection responsibilities with regard to LGBTI inmates. All agencies are required to train employeeson effective and professional communication with inmates, specifically LGBTI inmates.[203] Agencies areStaff  must ask the detainee about his or herown perception of  vulnerability and mustconsider the detainee’s physical build andappearance to determine the risk of  sexualvictimization.permitted to prohibit all sexual activity, but may not “deem such activity to constitute sexual abuse if  itdetermines that the activity is not coerced.”[204] Finally, in collecting data on sexual incidents, the facility “shallconsider whether the incident or allegation was motivated by ... gender identity; lesbian, gay, bisexual,transgender, or intersex identification, status, or perceived status ... or was motivated or otherwise caused byother group dynamics at the facility.”[205]LockupsAs do all individuals confined in a lockup, LGBTI individuals in such a facility[206] receive more limitedprotections under the Standards due to the temporary nature of  these facilities. Agency staff  must screendetainees for risk of  sexual victimization or abuse. Staff  must ask the detainee about his or her own perceptionof  vulnerability[207] and must consider the detainee’s physical build and appearance to determine the risk ofsexual victimization.[208]A lockup facility is not permitted to “search or physically examine a transgender or intersex detainee forthe sole purpose of  determining the detainee’s genital status.”[209] The facility is permitted to determine aninmate’s genital status “during conversations with the inmate, by reviewing medical records, or, if  necessary, bylearning that information as part of  a broader medical examination conducted in private by a medicalpractitioner.”[210] Furthermore, the lockup must train staff  to conduct cross-gender, transgender, and intersexsearches in a “professional and respectful manner, and in the least intrusive manner possible, consistent withsecurity needs.”[211]Finally, in conducting sexual abuse incidentreviews, the lockup must “[c]onsider whether the incidentor allegation was motivated by . . . gender identity;lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersexidentification, status, or perceived status . . . or wasmotivated or otherwise caused by other group dynamicsat the lockup.”[212]Community CorrectionsThe Standards also require that LGBTI residents of  community confinement facilities[213] be screenedfor risk of  sexual victimization and abuse. The intake screening must consider whether the resident is or isperceived to be LGBTI or questioning.[214] Facilities must reassess a resident’s risk level “when warranted dueto a referral, request, incident of  sexual abuse, or receipt of  additional information that bears on the resident’srisk of  sexual victimization or abusiveness.”[215]When making housing and programming assignments for a transgender or intersex resident, “the agencyshall consider on a case-by-case basis whether a placement would ensure the resident’s health and safety, andwhether the placement would present management or security problems.”[216] The facility shall not placeLGBTI residents “in dedicated facilities, units, or wings solely on the basis of  such identification orstatus”[217] unless such placement is consistent with a consent decree, legal settlement, or legal judgment.[218]The facility must give serious consideration to the transgender or intersex resident’s view about his or hersafety.[219] Finally, transgender and intersex residents must be permitted to use the toilet and showerseparately from other residents.[220]The Standards place limits on cross-gender viewing and searches. “The facility shall not search orphysically examine a transgender or intersex resident for the sole purpose of  determining the resident’s genitalstatus. The facility is permitted to determine an inmate’s genital status “during conversations with the inmate,by reviewing medical records, or, if  necessary, by learning that information as part of  a broader medicalexamination conducted in private by a medical practitioner.”[221] “The agency shall train security staff  in howto conduct cross-gender pat-down searches, and searches of  transgender and intersex residents, in aprofessional and respectful manner, and in the least intrusive manner possible, consistent with securityneeds.”[222]The Standards also provide guidance for agency staff  on training, investigation, and data collection withregard to LGBTI residents. The facility must train employees who may have contact with LGBTI residents tocommunicate effectively and professionally with them. Agencies are permitted to prohibit all sexual activity,but may not “deem such activity to constitute sexual abuse if  it determines that the activity is notcoerced.”[223] When conducting incident reviews, the agency must “[c]onsider whether the incident orallegation was motivated by . . . gender identity; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex identification,status, or perceived status… or was motivated or otherwise caused by other group dynamics at thefacility.”[224]Elements of  Legally Sound and Effective Policy and PracticeAll policies should be based on the following guiding principles:[225]Respectful interactions between inmates, residents, and staff; between inmates; and between residents.Do no harm.Safety of  vulnerable inmates or residents.Adoption of  accepted correctional practice.Accountability in operations.Recognition of  the agency’s legal obligations.In addition, all policies should include the following elements:Statement of  purpose.Enumeration of  included groups.Prohibitions.Requirements.Scope of  applicability.Definitions.Responsibilities.Enforcement and sanctions (for both staff  and inmates or residents).Training and dissemination methods.The following areas should be addressed when developing, revising, or implementing policies to ensurethe safety of  LGBTI inmates or residents in custodial settings:Nondiscrimination.Intake screening.Risk assessment, classification, and housing.Program participation.Respectful communication with LGBTI populations.Medical care.Mental health care.Privacy and safety.Transportation.Inmate orientation.Staff  training.Volunteer and contractor training.Each of  these areas is discussed in greater detail below. Each section includes a discussion of  thepurpose for adopting a specific policy and a list of  questions to consider when drafting or revising policies andprocedures. Policies should fill the gap between what is required under the law and what should be done asgood correctional practice. Appendix D includes examples of  agency policies that address some of  theseissues.Nondiscrimination PoliciesAgencies should develop, adopt, and enforce policies that explicitly prohibit discrimination andmistreatment of  inmates or residents on the basis of  sex, age, race, national origin, disability, and actual orperceived sexual orientation and gender identity. These policies should specifically prohibit harassment andabuse of  inmates or residents by staff  or other inmates or residents based on gender identity or sexualorientation.Following is a list of  questions to ask about an agency’s nondiscrimination policy:NondiscriminationPolicy ChecklistYES NODoes the agency have anondiscrimination policy foremployees, inmates, residents,and/or volunteers?  Does the agency policyrequire all LGBTI inmates orresidents to be treated withfairness, dignity, and respect?  Does the agency policyprohibit attempts by staff  toridicule or change an inmate’sor resident’s sexual orientationor gender identity?  Does the agency policydefine staff  duty to provide safeand healthy environments inwhich all individuals are treatedwith respect and dignity?  Does the agency policydefine staff  responsibility forprotecting the civil rights ofLGBTI inmates or residentswhile in custody, and ensuringtheir physical and emotionalwell-being and safety infacilities?  Does the agency policydefine the elements of  incidentreporting to include complaintsof  harassment, discrimination,and abuse?  Does the agency policyprovide training and resourcesregarding the societal, familial,and developmental challengesconfronting LGBTI inmates orresidents?  Does the agency policyaddress the collection andanalysis of  data regarding theneeds of  LGBTI inmates orresidents in its custody?  Does the agency use thecollected data and analysis tomake decisions?  Does the agency policyrequire equal access toprogramming for LGBTIinmates or residents (notdependent on classification)?  If  the agency policypermits conjugal visiting forheterosexual couples, does thepolicy also permit conjugal  visits for same-sex couples? If  the answer to most of  these questions is “yes,” it is likely that the agency is close to being in line withfederal and state laws and regulations as well as constitutional provisions for LGBTI inmates or residents. Ifthe answer to even some of  these questions is “no,” it may indicate that the agency has some work to do inthis area, and a policy revision based on the legal rights outlined above and in the PREA Standards is in order. Download LGBTI Adults under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Intake, Risk Assessment, and ClassificationIntake and Risk AssessmentIdentifying safety concerns for LGBTI inmates or residents is an important factor in determining risk.Agencies should develop and implement intake processes to identify and assess risk for LGBTI inmates orresidents who are vulnerable to physical and sexual assault, taking the inmate’s or resident’s assessment of  riskinto consideration.Following is a list of  questions to ask about an agency’s intake and risk assessment policy:Intake and Risk Assessment PolicyChecklistYES NODuring intake and initial classification,does the agency ascertain information aboutthe inmate’s or resident’s sexual orientationand/or gender identity?  During the course of  the inmate’s orresident’s incarceration, does the agencyperiodically update information regarding hisor her sexual orientation and genderidentity?  Do the agency employees whoconduct initial screening and classificationreceive training regarding sensitivity inconducting interviews with LGBTI inmatesor residents?  Does the agency policy require that aninmate’s or resident’s sexual orientationand/or gender identity be verified bymultiple sources prior to classification?  Are medical practitioners the onlystaff  permitted to physically examineinmates or residents to gather informationabout gender identity?  Does the agency policy have a processto document and accommodate theconcerns of  LGBTI inmates or residents interms of  safety, name, pronoun, toilet andshower preference, and searches?  Do the agency medical and mentalhealth staff  use screening tools that aredeveloped specifically for LGBTI inmates orresidents?  Does the agency policy requirediversity training for employees that includesthe impact of  name-calling and harassment?   If  the answer to even some of  these questions is “no,” the agency will need to revise its policy to bemore in line with the PREA Standards that address risk assessment and screening. Under the PREA Standards,the intake screening must, at a minimum, consider whether the inmate or resident is or is perceived to beLGBTI or gender nonconforming.[226] Risk assessment and screening are crucial to the safety of  LGBTIinmates and residents, especially when those are the tools and policies in place to inform housing options incustody. All screening tools should include vulnerability assessments, the types of  housing decisions that staffcan make, and a stipulation as to when an assessment requires moving a decision up the chain of  command.Housing and classification determinations are key to ensuring safety and limiting agency liability. Download LGBTI Adults under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]ClassificationGiven the actual and potential harassment and abuse directed toward LGBTI inmates or residents,protecting their safety is unquestionably a legitimate concern.Following is a list of  questions to ask about an agency’s classification policy:Classification Policy Checklist YES NOIs the agency classification policybased on individualized needs that balancethe inmates’ or residents’ physical andemotional well-being and safety?  Is the agency classification processobjective and free of  individual biases?  Is the agency classification processdefined in written policies and procedures?  Does the agency prohibit blanketpolicies regarding the classification ofLGBTI inmates or residents, or thoseperceived to be LGBTI?  Does the agency classification policygovern the placement of  inmates orresidents into sex-offender programs orunits based on articulated criteria, includingorders of  the court?  Do the agency classification andhousing policy and procedures considerphysical layout and privacy issues whendetermining the location for an LGBTIinmate or resident?  Does the agency place vulnerableinmates or residents in the least restrictiveenvironment necessary to ensure safety andprovide the inmates or residents with equalaccess to facility services?  Do the agency classificationprocedures address how inmates orresidents in various classifications arehoused if  the facility is crowded?  Do the agency classification andhousing procedures consider privacyconcerns when assigning housing forLGBTI inmates or residents?  Does the agency develop responsesto abuse or harassment (or threat of  abuseor harassment) of  LGBTI inmates orresidents that do not rely on the isolationor segregation of  these inmates orresidents?   Some agencies respond to safety concerns by placing LGBTI inmates in administrative segregation orprotective custody. However, instead of  isolating LGBTI inmates, staff  should consider other strategies asoutlined in classification policies. The safety of  inmates or residents can be achieved by ensuring appropriatestaff-to-inmate ratios; modeling respectful behavior; providing close supervision of  inmates or residents;promptly intervening to interrupt any disrespect, harassment, or abuse directed at other inmates or residents;and keeping inmates or residents meaningfully engaged in constructive programming.Additionally, LGBTI inmates should be classified and housed in sex offender units or programs only asconsistent with the agency’s policies or court orders. It is not appropriate to house LGBTI inmates in sexoffender units solely because of  their gender identity or sexual orientation. Download LGBTI Adults under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]HousingDetermining gender-appropriate housing for transgender and intersex inmates or residents may be achallenge. Some state and local correctional and law enforcement agencies have written policies concerning thehousing of  transgender and intersex inmates. These policies incorporate an individualized approach tohousing, as recommended by the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission and the final PREAStandards.Following is a list of  questions to ask about an agency’s classification and housing policies fortransgender and intersex inmates or residents:Classification and HousingChecklist for Transgender and IntersexYES NOInmates or ResidentsDo the agency classification andhousing policies include evaluation of  aperson’s current genital status in makingplacement decisions?  Do the agency classification andhousing policies include factors relating tothe inmate’s or resident’s emotional andphysical well-being, and that prioritize theinmate’s or resident’s evaluation of  his or hersafety?  Do the agency classification andhousing policies include a review of  aninmate’s or resident’s privacy concerns,available housing options, andrecommendations from the inmate’s orresident’s mental health providers regardingappropriate housing or classification?  Does or can the agency provide accessto private toilet and shower facilities, whennecessary, or a single room for sleeping,while allowing inmates or residents to havefull access to the facility’s dailyprogramming?  Does or can the agency placetransgender inmates or residents accordingto their core gender identity rather than theirbirth sex?  When it is necessary, can the agencyplace transgender inmates or residents safelyaccording to birth sex to protect theirphysical and emotional well-being?  Does the agency house transgenderinmates or residents in a mixed-gender unit  or program?Does the agency determinereclassification needs based on requests byinmates or residents or based onvictimization?   Individualized decision-making is key in making appropriate and ultimately safe housing decisions forLGBTI inmates and residents. Currently, some agencies have policies that specifically call for individualizedplacement decisions for transgender and intersex individuals. Download LGBTI Adults under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Respectful CommunicationRespectful communications between staff  and inmates or residents should be the agency’s objective,including how LGBTI inmates are addressed based on their gender preference.Following is a list of  questions to ask about an agency’s respectful communication policy for inmates orresidents:Respectful Communication withLGBTI Inmates or Residents PolicyChecklistYES NODoes the agency have a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment,including harassment by staff  and inmate-on-inmate or resident-on-residentharassment?  Does the agency policy includedirection to staff  on how to address LGBTIinmates or residents using respectful andappropriate language?  If  the agency policy permits inmatesor residents to wear clothing other thanissued clothing, does the policy permit themto express themselves through clothing or  grooming (within the bounds of  safety forall inmates or residents)?Does the agency policy addressconfidentiality of  information, includingstaff  disclosure relating to the privacy andconfidentiality of  LGBTI inmates orresidents?  Does the agency policy adhere to allconfidentiality and privacy protectionsafforded LGBTI inmates or residents underapplicable state law?  Does the agency policy allow forsharing the information necessary to achievea particular purpose, such as identifying anappropriate placement in another facility?  Does the agency policy provide foreligible LGBTI inmates or residents toaccess programming and services withinfacilities?   LGBTI policies should consider addressing transgender inmates or residents by the name and pronounthat the inmate prefers. If  an agency’s policies allow inmates or residents to wear clothing other than thatissued by the institution, consideration should be given to permitting inmates or residents to express theirgender identity through clothing. Also, where appropriate, agencies may consider allowing inmates or residentsto express their gender identity in matters of  grooming.Correctional staff  should respect each inmate’s or resident’s privacy and should never disclose aninmate’s or resident’s sexual orientation or gender identity unless the inmate or resident has given thempermission, or unless security or another important agency interest requires the disclosure. Download LGBTI Adults under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Medical and Mental Health CareAt a minimum, policies on medical and mental health should provide all inmates and residents withaccess to appropriate medical and mental health care. LGBTI inmates or residents identified as needing mentalhealth or medical care should receive the care they need. Agencies should work to ensure that medicalpersonnel are knowledgeable about the health needs of  LGBTI inmates or residents—especially transgenderinmates or residents.Following is a list of  questions to ask about an agency’s medical and mental health care policy forinmates or residents:Medical and Mental Health CarePolicy ChecklistYES NODo the agency medical and mentalhealth protocols include opportunities forLGBTI inmates or residents to accessservices that address self-acceptance andvalidation, concerns about disclosure ofsexual orientation or gender identity, familyrelationships, healthy intimate relationships,and sexual decisionmaking?  Does the agency policy promote thehiring of  medical and mental healthprofessionals who have expertise and/orexperience in working with LGBTI inmatesor residents?  In assessing an inmate’s or resident’smedical and/or mental health status, doesthe agency policy direct medical staff  toinclude an assessment of  an inmate’s orresident’s safety?  Do the agency medical and mentalhealth protocols direct those conductingmedical screening to inquire about theinmate’s or resident’s sexual activity, sexualorientation, and gender identity, both beforeand during incarceration?  Do the agency medical protocolsprovide for gynecological and obstetricalcare?  Do the agency medical protocolsprovide for HIV and STI testing, care, andconfidentiality?  Do the agency medical and mentalhealth protocols provide for counseling forsexual trauma that occurred either before orduring incarceration?  Do the agency medical and mentalhealth protocols provide for mental healthevaluations that include assessment of  anarray of  mental health diagnoses, includinggender dysphoria?  Do the agency medical protocolsaddress medical care for transgenderinmates or residents, including evaluation oftheir care prior to incarceration?   At a minimum, agencies should ensure that inmates or residents have access to medical personnel whoare knowledgeable about the particular health needs of  LGBTI people. LGBTI inmates or residents shouldhave access to appropriate professionals who can provide all medically necessary treatment. If  the facilitycannot provide treatment on site, then the inmates or residents should be transported to the provider. Anymedical care an LGBTI inmate or resident receives prior to arriving at the facility, such as hormone treatments,should be continued upon arrival at the facility after consultation with the appropriate medical providers. Download LGBTI Adults under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Privacy and SafetyAgency policy should address how transgender inmates or residents are housed by assessing their safetyand privacy during toileting, showering, and sleeping. In general, policies that are integral to addressing thesafety and privacy issues and concerns of  LGBTI inmates or residents include:Cross-gender supervision.Use of  facilities—bathrooms, showers, etc.Search procedures.Undressing.Following is a list of  questions to ask about an agency’s privacy and safety policy for inmates:Privacy and Safety PolicyChecklistYES NODoes the agency practice cross-gender supervision of  inmates or residents?Explain your answer.  Does the agency policy address levelsof  staffing and supervision?  Does the agency policy address thesafety and privacy needs of  LGBTI inmatesor residents in regard to toileting,showering, and sleeping?  Does the agency policy address howpat and strip searches of  LGBTI inmatesor residents are conducted?  Does the agency policy addresssearch procedures and privacy needs ofLGBTI inmates or residents?  Does the agency policy require thatinmate or resident grievances be tracked,and does the agency collect and analyzeinformation on grievances related tosearches?   The key to developing sound policy in these areas is to focus on ways in which the facility can protectthe privacy, dignity, and safety of  LGBTI inmates or residents during all facility procedures. Policies shouldavoid subjecting transgender inmates or residents to unnecessary risk of  physical and emotional harm. Thismay need to be done on a case-by-case basis where staff  members work with the transgender inmate orresident to determine the best solution for accessing the bathroom, showering, changing clothing, submittingto searches, and drug testing that protects their privacy, dignity, and safety. Download LGBTI Adults under Custodial Supervision Checklists [1]Sexual Abuse of  LGBTI Inmates or ResidentsIt is important for agencies to recognize all elements of  sexual behavior in custody and to have policiesthat manage these behaviors. Policies should also pay special attention to the LGBTI inmate’s or resident’sincreased vulnerability to abuse, reporting mechanisms, investigations, and discipline, if  necessary.Following is a list of  questions to ask about an agency’s sexual abuse policy for inmates: Sexual Abuse Policy Checklist YES NODoes the agency policy prohibit thesexual abuse of  inmates or residents incustody?  Does the agency policy stipulate thatstaff  must receive training regarding thesexuality and sexual behaviors of  inmatesor residents?  Does the agency policy require theinvestigation of  all reports of  violations ofpolicy regarding sexual abuse?  Does the agency have multiplemethods for inmates or residents to reportsexual abuse, including avenues for third-party, independent reporting?  Does the agency policy address themanagement of  inmates or residents whoreport allegations of  sexual abuse?  Do the agency inmate or residentdisciplinary procedures address disciplinefor those who have sustained violations ofrecanting previous allegations?  Does the agency policy define theroles and responsibilities of  theinvestigative process into allegations of  sexual abuse?Does the agency policy (or theinvestigative entity’s policy) require referralof  allegations of  potential criminal activityfor review by the prosecutor?  Does the agency policy require areview of  reports and investigations ofsexual abuse?  Does the agency policy establish asexual assault response team (SART)?  Do the agency protocols provide forongoing medical and mental health care foran inmate or resident who has beensexually victimized while in custody?  Does the agency policy recognizeparticularly vulnerable populations, such asLGBTI inmates or residents, and specifytreatment for them?  In correctional settings, there is a continuum of  sexual behaviors that may include nonabusive orabusive sexual contact. It is important that agencies recognize this continuum of  sexual behaviors in custody,have policies that reflect the continuum, and pay special attention to the increased vulnerability of  LGBTIinmates or residents.

    "abstract": "The Project on Addressing Prison Rape (the Project) at American University’s Washington College of Law (WCL) has had a cooperative agreement with the National Institute of Corrections (NIC) to provide training and technical assistance to high-level correctional decisionmakers on key issues in preventing and addressing staff sexual misconduct since 1999. In 2003, with the enactment of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), the Project’s focus shifted to addressing prison rape—both staff sexual misconduct and inmateon- inmate sexual abuse. Beginning in 2006, Smith Consulting began a collaborative effort with the Project and NIC to focus efforts on providing technical assistance to the field of corrections on a variety of issues.\nSince the passage of PREA in 2003, increased national and international attention has been paid to the issue of sexual abuse of individuals in custody. As identified by the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission (NPREC) during its fact-finding process, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals—both adults and youth—under custodial supervision are one of the groups most at risk for abuse. In June 2009, NPREC proposed comprehensive standards for eliminating sexual abuse of LGBTI individuals in custodial settings. The final standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in May 2012 recognized the unique vulnerabilities of LGBTI populations kept intact most of NPREC’s findings and recommendations and in several instances, strengthened the protections for LGBTI populations. DOJ is continuing to issue guidance on gender non-conforming individuals as it relates to the standards specifically through the FAQ section on the National PREA Resource Center’s website.\nHowever, this fundamental question remains unanswered: Have the conditions changed that allow the abuse of LGBTI individuals in custodial settings to occur? Although several state and local systems have made strides in addressing sexual abuse of LGBTI individuals in their care, much work remains. With the final standards as benchmarks, along with stronger laws protecting LGBTI individuals from abuse, progress can be swift and abuse of LGBTI individuals in custody can be significantly reduced.\nIn the first edition of this guide, we aimed to reach out to correctional agencies in order to help them identify, address, and respond to abuse of LGBTI individuals through agency policies and procedures. We hoped to deepen the dialogue between staff and administrators as well as community leaders and criminal justice advocates about strategies to eliminate abuse of LGBTI individuals in custody. The second edition of this guide provides updated key information to correctional agencies about PREA’s impact on agency practice as it relates to LGBTI individuals in custody",
