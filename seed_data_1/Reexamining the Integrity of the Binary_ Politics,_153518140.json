Astrada & Scott B. Astrada*  ABSTRACT  Politicized identity, which finds expression in the law, is binary-based. In light of the role that it plays in national political and legal debates triggered by various groups challenging identity-based binaries, this article reexamines the integrity of the binary that lies at the core of how courts construe legal identity. Basic-identity binaries have and continue to play a profound role in legal thought and practice. This article thus explores the relationship and tension between law and binary-based identity signifiers. We explore the notion that the law’s use of the binary-based identity signifier is premised on antiquated assumptions and simplified schemata that, to better recognize rights and apply judicial remedies and protections of individuals and groups that fall outside the binary, will perhaps require the courts to adopt a more flexible approach to identity. Politicized identity may be at the heart of contestations between those who wish to preserve and those who wish to obliterate basic binaries, but the law is a special case and will be uniquely affected by the fallout that results from this process. We thus employ case law and concepts from philosophy and legal theory to flesh out an emerging problem in the law. Our intent in this paper is to reexamine the basic binary nature of legal identity, the components and dynamics that undergird it, the consequences that result from its application, and the tensions and challenges that result from rejecting the integrity of the binary within law.  INTRODUCTION  In the present political environment, politicized identity encompasses a variety of disparate and passionate debates over the form and substance of public policy, from who is legally allowed to use which gendered public bathroom to reformulating trade policy from an “America First” perspective.1 Recently, politicized identity has fueled                                                  © 2018 Marvin L.

Resistance to this agenda is based, in part, on the realization that a transition back toward traditional binaries is problematic and potentially harmful.7 In fact, traditional binaries have historically been the basis for exclusionary, if not discriminatory, public policy.8 In light of the modern historical struggle against identity-based binaries that began in the 1960s, and recent resistance and protests                                                  1 See America First Foreign Policy, WHITE HOUSE, http://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-foreign-policy (last visited Dec. 23, 2017); America First Energy Plan, WHITE HOUSE, https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy (last visited Dec. 23, 2017). 2 See Emanuella Grinberg & Madison Park, Second Day of Protests over Trump's Immigration Policies, CNN (Jan. 30, 2017, 1:42 AM), http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/us-immigration-protests/index.html.  3 See Gregory Krieg, Donald Trump Reveals when He Thinks America was Great, CNN (Mar. 28, 2016, 5:36 PM), http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/26/politics/donald-trump-when-america-was-great/index.html. 4 See Jonathan Mahler, Donald Trump’s Message Resonates with White Supremacists, N.Y.

Consider, for instance, the legal and public policy debate that took place over which public restrooms transgender individuals must use in North Carolina—and the previous (Obama) and current (Trump) Administrations’ antipodal reactions to the matter.11 The bathroom controversy reveals a deeper tension that is emerging in the law regarding the role of politicized identity in the legal and policy realms.12 Other states, such as Texas, also considered pursuing                                                  9 See Krieg, supra note 3. 10 See Oregon First US State to Add Third Gender Option on Driver ID, BBC (June 16, 2017), http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40309362 (“Beginning in July, Oregon residents who do not identify as male or female can mark X for sex on driver's licenses, learner's permits and state IDs.”); Casey Parks, Oregon Court Allows Person to Change Sex from “Female” to “Non-Binary,” THE OREGONIAN/OREGONLIVE (June 10, 2016),  http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/06/oregon_court_allows_person_to.html (detailing In the Matter of Sex Change of Jamie Shupe, wherein an Oregon Circuit Court found “that a transgender person can legally change their sex to ‘non-binary’ rather than male or female in what legal experts believe is a first in the United States.

American society has become more politically diversified along racial, ethnic, and sex/gender identity lines, and the culturally homogenous norm of the “average American” has drastically shifted since the late 1960s.16 The conflict between those adhering to traditional binaries and those questioning the assumptions underlying said binaries can be readily observed in law and public policy.17 Indeed, law plays a central role in these present conflicts, as many of the actions taken and policies advanced by the current Administration are being challenged in the                                                  Amid Criticism, WASH.

Carolene Products Co.,22 to illustrate and explore the deep binary-based nature of identity-based jurisprudence to further examine and discuss the conflicts between the basic binary nature of legal identity, the components and dynamics that undergird it, the consequences that result from its application, and the tensions and challenges that result from rejecting the integrity of the binary within law.23 This article’s reexamination of the integrity of the binary is designed to foster critical reflection and debate; it seeks to provoke discussion on whether it is desirable to scrap the binary, retain it, or if possible to apply it in the law to reflect changes in the make-up of society.24 Going forward, we discuss the politics and complexity of                                                  18 See, e.g., Meridith Mcgraw et al., A Timeline of Trump's Immigration Executive Order and Legal Challenges, ABC NEWS (June 29, 2017), http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/timeline-president-trumps-immigration-executive-order-legal-challenges/story?id=45332741. 19 Smith v.

Id. at 251. This case exemplifies how recent challenges to the binary nature of identity are affecting judicial remedies and protections. Notably, the Kosilek decision — which was overturned on appeal— is unique in its expansion of the scope of judicial remedies and protections under law. Despite being overturned, the decision is indicative of why, going forward, it is important to ask what insight can be gained by critically reexamining entrenched binary-based identity signifiers, especially in the context of civil rights and identity in the law. Dunnavant, supra note 23, at 15–16 (“The [Kosilek] decision represented the first time a U.S. prison was court ordered to provide a transgender prisoner with this type of surgery.”). Although it was overturned, the decision is nevertheless instructive on discussions of binary-based identities and their use in the law. Dunnavant notes that, “Judge Thompson, in her dissenting opinion, criticizes the majority for employing de novo review to the highly factual issue of deliberate indifference, instead of a deferential, clear error standard. If the court had employed the proper standard, according to Thompson, they would have accepted the district court’s factual determinations, as the majority of experts in the case concurred that gender confirmation surgery was medically necessary for Kosilek and the evidence presented at trial provided ample support for the district court’s conclusions.” Id. at 17 (citations omitted). 25 See infra Part I. 26 See infra Part II 27 See infra Part III. 28 See infra Part IV. 29 See infra Conclusion.

The intent is to emphasize the importance of revisiting the binary as it is conceptualized and applied in law. First, it is necessary to define some key terms employed in the remainder of this work. The basic unit of analysis vis-à-vis the binary is that of the “juridical subject.”30 In its most basic form, a juridical subject is a doctrinal entity “endowed with juridical personality who [is] usually known as a collective person, social person, or legal entity.”31 A subject has rights and obligations under law, and may qualify for judicial protections if the courts find that a subject falls within a specified legal classification, e.g., “discrete and insular minority.”32  A “legal identity” is comprised of the space within which the subject and the law interact; it is an identity that is conferred upon the subject by law, e.g., race and ethnicity as legal classifications that entitle a subject to claim the protections of identity-based legislation.33 Lastly, a “non-binary identity” is one in which the subject                                                  30 As used in this work, “subject” is shorthand for juridical subject. 31 Elvia Arcelia Quintana Adriano, The Natural Person, Legal Entity or Juridical Person and Juridical Personality, 4 PENN. ST. J. OF L. & INT'L AFF. 363, 366 (2015). “The elements that contribute to the formation of a legal person are the following:   Existence of a being or subject: A subject of law is any being capable to act as holder of powers, or liable with obligations in a juridical relationship. The term subject of law or juridical being alludes to an unspecified person in terms of strict law.   Will of the subject or being. The action of a subject with the intention of producing certain legal effects, and should be highlighted its importance for the law, since this will should be also expressed in an appropriate manner to produce legal consequences.   Subjective rights. This refers to the power of the juridical norms which is granted to express or omit certain conduct that ensures the judicial protection   Juridical personality . . .    Obligations. The obligation is understood as the existing juridical bond between the demand of a subjective right by its holder and the duty to fulfill the conduct based on the norm that is imposed on the other subject who belongs to the relationship … In the juridical field, the word personality has several meanings. It is often used to indicate the quality of a person to be considered as a center of juridical norms or as a subject of rights and obligations.” Id. at 375–76. 32 United States v.

Legal identity lays out the relationship between the State and the juridical subject.35 From the founding, when various human beings were not fully recognized as human in the fundamental law as expounded upon in the initial U.S. Constitution—such as African slaves, Native Americans, women, and children—to the post-Civil War era, and continuing through to the present, identity has played a key role in the evolution of the law and its relationship to those it ostensibly serves.36 In the present time, however, it seems that there are major developments occurring on the domestic sociocultural and political stages which are premised on either substantially modifying, e.g., the inclusion of the LGBTQ identity group into the traditional heterosexual-based Male/Female marriage institution,37 or eradiating, e.g., the notion of our society being at the threshold of moving beyond He/She,38 the                                                  question of whether or not “Hispanic” constitutes a racial category when interpreting Title VII Id. at 606–07.

Prominent binaries that the law has employed and concretized in legal discourse include Black/White, Heterosexual/Homosexual, and Male/Female, to name a few.47 These are some basic binaries that, though they have been complicated by efforts to broaden the scope of inclusion or clarify the nuances of sub-identities that are subsumed by the basic binary, continue to provide the judicial expositors of law with a primary basis for the administration of justice. In light of recent history, from the late 1960s through the present, especially with the establishment of modern politicized identity groups challenging the power dynamics and composition of the traditional identity binary, it seemed that the basic identity binary, because of its simplicity and distortionary effects, was on its way to becoming an outdated construct. One of the most radical challenges to the binary notion of oppression and revolt, for instance, was the Combahee River Collective, a Black feminist lesbian organization active in Boston from 1974 to 1980.48 The Collective articulated a viable sub-identity within the mainstream feminist movement, which was comprised primarily of white women, and based, in large part, on Male/Female, White/Black, and Heterosexual/Homosexual identity                                                  Bollinger and Regents of the U. of Cal. v.

The Court's ruling in Fisher I took Grutter and Bakke as given and did not directly revisit the constitutionality of using race as a factor in college admissions); Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476 (1993) (holding that a state may punish offenders more harshly when considering whether a crime was committed or initially considered due to an intended victim's status in a protected class). 47 There are numerous examples of the Court’s use of binary-based identity as a basis for articulating and adjudicating identity-based cases. See, e.g., Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 529 (2004) (expounding on the able-bodied/disabled dichotomy); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684–85 (1973) (detailing historical sex-based distinctions memorialized in the Court’s jurisprudence such as Bradwell v. Illinois, 83 U.S. 130, 142 (1873)). It should also be noted that, while the binary provides the super-structure of the juridical enterprise—Guilty/Not Guilty in criminal adjudication, for instance—we are very much aware that variegated permutations have emerged and that the binary is far more complex in actuality than a purely biaxial framework upon which law, politics, and public policy are based.  48 See Wini Breines, What’s Love Got to Do with It?

Certain indicators point to a trend toward rejecting basic identity binaries and signifiers. Specifically, millennials tend to reject traditional basic identity binaries, especially in the realms of gender, sexuality, and race/ethnicity.50 Similarly, there are calls for minorities (and sub-groups within minorities) to be distinguished from an overarching umbrella identity and receive equal treatment under law as far as legal benefits and protections are concerned.51 Macro- and micro-scale resistance in the form of rejecting gender and sexuality identities—blurring the lines between and among identities, as well as rejecting pronouns that reflect a basic binary, e.g., replacing Latino/Latina with LatinX52—seem to be indicative of a trend wherein basic identity-signifiers are being discarded for alternative formulations of identity.53 Identities once considered viable and concrete in the recent past, such as sexuality, gender, race, and ethnicity, seem to be quite fluid, and perhaps not                                                  49 The Combahee River Collective, Combahee River Collective: A Black Feminist Statement, 9 OFF OUR BACKS INC. 6, 6–8 (1979). 50 Jacqueline J.

These binaries delineate and make “real” the abstract space in which the law processes identity-based cases and controversies.70 The federal courts’ racial and civil rights jurisprudence, such as gauging the constitutionality of affirmative action programs in higher education, is a prime example of this space.71 The binary nature of the legal subject limits how one can define one’s self in lived social experience.72 The essential “tradeoff” between the efficiency of the binary and its inclusive nature, is that the law, in                                                  66 1 ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE, DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA 301–02 (Henry Reeve trans., D.

Lyotard labels “the differend,” that is,   the case where the plaintiff is divested of the means to argue and becomes for that reason a victim. If the addressor, the addressee, and the sense of the testimony are neutralized, everything takes place as if there were no damages [ ]. A case of differend between two parties takes place when the ‘regulation’ of the conflict that opposes them is done in the idiom of one of the parties while the wrong suffered by the other is not signified in that idiom.74   This silence is precisely what is at stake when the law cannot effectively “hear” a subject. The law does not oppress the non-binary subject, so much as it does not empower it to verbalize its needs and interests.75 The language of the non-binary exists outside the “establishment procedure,”76 and thus becomes only silence. The experience of a subject that is divested of speech as a result of not speaking the language of the law is of particular interest because the lived experience is bifurcated between the law that imposes an ulterior identity onto the subject, one that is un-relatable, and a lived experience that substantially differs from that identity.77   II. THE POLITICIZED AND BINARY-BASED NATURE OF IDENTITY IN LAW  This section discusses the politicized nature of binary-based identity and its relationship to the binary in the law. Politicized identity is premised on a basic binary basis.78 Formal identity-based groups such as the National Council of La Raza or the NAACP create, to some                                                  73 Id. 74 JEAN-FRANÇOIS LYOTARD, THE DIFFEREND: PHRASES IN DISPUTE 9 (GeorgesVan Den Abbeele, trans., Univ.

Politicized identity, itself a creature of history and culture, though distinct from legal identity, has been utilized by the courts to adjudicate cases and controversies that hinge on identity classifications.79 The question is not whether there is disconnect between identity based on lived experience and legal identity, but rather how radical the break is between the two. Turning to the question of how one experiences social identity, it is useful to draw from Martin Heidegger’s essay concerned with how one “dwells”80 as a subject. Applying this framework to understand how a subject experiences its politicized identity, and how that identity manifests in the law, provides additional insight into our inquiry. This section thus examines how the binary informs the present politics of identity, and how traditional binary-based identity signifiers continue to provide a framework for and insight into how identity and history impact dwelling in the present age.  In the context of exploring a subject’s lived experience outside of a juridical structure, Heidegger’s analysis of “dwelling”81 is particularly pertinent. The central question of dwelling is how a subject manifests in law and policy within a continuously evolving sociocultural and historical context.82 Dwelling is, to a large extent, sociocultural and historical in nature, and the foregoing actively shape the dwelling space within which a subject is defined, and sets the limits and possibilities of a subject’s perception and interpretation.83 For example, the idea of race, especially the legal definition of who is Black or Hispanic, emerges throughout various historical contexts—religious notions of race to scientific notions that have given way to a primarily sociocultural definition of race.84 The various structural components of identity, e.g., culture, race, ethnicity, gender, ideology, and geography,                                                  79 Id. 80 See MARTIN HEIDEGGER, Building Dwelling Thinking, in POETRY, LANGUAGE, THOUGHT 141–60 (Albert Hofstadter, trans., 1971).  81 Id. 82 Id.  83 Id. 84 See Bernstein, supra note 78. Astrada & Astrada  190  U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 17:2  are all inextricably linked as the background, the dwelling, from which a subject emerges and resides in.85   Ultimately, a subject dwells within its culture, which provides a behavioral system for a subject to interpret and define the world. Culture is the qualitative basis for the variability explaining how subjects dwell in an identity space, and how judges arrive at very different interpretations of the law. Culture lays the foundation for action, conduct, strategies, and thought, which finds ultimate expression in policy.86 In the case of identity-based cases and controversies, the courts have approached various identity-based statuses, such as race, ethnicity, and national origin, from a cultural lens; the constitutional and legal reasoning employed and conclusions reached are tinctured with a culturally informed binary.87 Culture can be conceived as a conceptual catalogue that catalogues possible interpretations of an experience, and political culture as a subset that itemizes the political dimension of experience.88 Depending on the cultural legacy inherited by a particular society, social subjects will have an inventory of possible courses of action from which to choose.89 The inventory of options contributes to identity, to what someone is or is not.90 Groups and individuals grasp and comprehend their “essence,” distinctive identity, by identifying                                                  85 See Paul Harrison, “How shall I say it…?” Relating the Non-Relational, 39 ENV’T AND PLAN. 590, 595 (2007) (discussing the elements of the self in relation to suffering). 86 See, e.g., Loving v.

New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991) (holding that a prosecutor's peremptory challenges of Latino jurors based on doubts about the ability of such jurors to defer to official interpreter’s translation of Spanish-language testimony did not violate the Equal Protection Clause); Hernandez v.

Court opinions, the textual products of interpretation, provide such reference points.

The aforementioned opinions are exemplars of judicial opinions as a form of policy, and how opinions can retain high degrees of continuity but can also accommodate “change” vis-à-vis circumstances. Applying a cultural lens to identity, law, and policy better equips one to identify and gauge the influence of the varied cognitive maps that anchor and encapsulate thought and possibility, as utilized by interpreters such as Judge Thompson in her dissent in Kosilek.102  Court opinions, as expositions of truth, are, among other things, interpretations that seek to provide answers that are “part of a much larger network or system of questions and answers and further questions instead of being merely discrete self-contained units of information.”103 Behavior does not take place in a vacuum; in the case of interpretation, culture exerts a gravitational pull, so to speak, on the interminable ebb and flow of the meaning of identity in the law.104 Identity (and policy) not only reflects the values, norms, content, and character of the interpreter, but more importantly the cultural superstructure that informs policy.105 Court opinions establish a corpus of truth, a regime of truth based on knowledge that the courts apply and obtain through the interpretive process.106 Opinions constitute a textual and ideational structure upon which meaning is produced and produces.107 Culture serves to define, anchor, legitimate, and contextualize interpretation.                                                  100 Bowers v.

[C]ulture . . . manifest[s] in customs, in beliefs, and in forms of government.’”109 It is in this context that culture is the foundation that grounds the binary structure, while also privileging one term over the other (e.g., White/Black, Male/Female).110  III.

Gloor, 618 F.2d 264, 270–71 (5th Cir. 1980) (upholding a district court ruling that an employer's policy requiring employees to speak English only while at work did not violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibition against national origin discrimination). A “person who speaks only one tongue or to a person who has difficulty using another language than the one spoken in his home, language might well be an immutable characteristic like skin color, sex or place of birth. However, the language a person who is multi-lingual elects to speak at a particular time is by definition a matter of choice . . . We do not consider rules that turn on the language used in an employee's home, the one he chooses to speak when not at work or the tongue spoken by his parents or grandparents. In some circumstances, the ability to speak or the speaking of a language other than English might be equated with national origin, but this case concerns only a requirement that persons capable of speaking English do so while on duty. That this rule prevents some employees, like Mr. Garcia, from exercising a preference to converse in Spanish does not convert it into discrimination based on national origin. Reduced to its simplest, the claim is ‘others like to speak English on the job and do so without penalty. Speaking Spanish is very important to me and is inherent in my ancestral national origin. Therefore, I should be permitted to speak it and the denial to me of that preference so important to my self-identity is statutorily forbidden.’ The argument thus reduces itself to a contention that the statute commands employers to permit employees to speak the tongue they prefer. We do not think the statute permits that interpretation, whether the preference be slight or strong or even one closely related to self-identity. Mr. Garcia and the EEOC would have us adopt a standard that the employer's business needs must be accomplished in the manner that appears to us to be the least restrictive. The statute does not give the judiciary such latitude in the absence of discrimination.” Id. 109 Robert C. Tucker, Culture, Political Culture, and Communist Society, 88 POL. SCI.

Carolene Products’ Footnote Four and Concretizing the Binary  Binaries continue to shape the courts’ approach to identity.111 To undermine traditional notions of a legal binary identity is to blur the lines between the present and the past—to recognize the historical subjectivity of one’s now and to destabilize the basis upon which an entire jurisprudence has been built.112 The Court’s Footnote Four in United States v. Carolene Products Co. is a vivid exemplar of law reflecting and reifying an historically based identity binary in the form of “discrete and insular minorities.”113 Such minorities, analytically and legally speaking, have pervaded the law; conceptually, they embody a legal-rational construct that permeates legal actuality as produced by court interpretation and opinions.114 The binary has thus been the basis of the most “progressive” innovations in law and policy emanating from the bench.115 In light of this, it seems paradoxical and problematic that the political and public policy realms are reflecting a rejection of the very basis that the law has employed to protect groups that have faced historical discrimination, violence, and exclusion from full and substantive participation in the polity.                                                   111 See generally Julie A.

Astrada & Astrada 2018]   REEXAMINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE BINARY 195  One of the most famous footnotes in United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, i.e., Footnote Four from Carolene Products,116 captures the entrenchment of the binary. It is, in Justice Powell’s words, “the most celebrated footnote in constitutional law.”117 Although Footnote Four did not give rise to the binary nor mark the prominent moment when the Court embedded a binary framework into its jurisprudence,118 it does mark a very clear moment in time when the binary is explicitly articulated as being an integral part of the genesis of modern equal protection jurisprudence and clarifies the juridical subject in the context of Court interpretation.119 The Court ponders, in Footnote Four, “whether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.”120 Footnote Four becomes the self-referential basis upon which, among other things, the Court has based its tiered scrutiny framework, and adjudges the manner in which a right translates into a constitutional protection.121  Although Footnote Four is multidimensional, it is important to keep in mind “the fact that the Carolene Products Footnote is about values.”122 The primary value that Footnote Four memorializes is that of the Court’s power to review legislation to further the protection of minority rights—minorities that are viewed in and derive protection from a basic binary basis.123 The binary is one that can be characterized                                                  116 United States v.

A reasonable interpretation of the terms, as used in the Footnote, is that the minority groups to whom it refers to   are not able to play their proper role in democratic politics. They are “discrete” in the sense that they are separate in some way, identifiable as distinct from the rest of society. They are “insular” in the sense that other groups will not form coalitions with them—and, critically, not because of a lack of common interests but because of “prejudice.”127   Various jurists and parties to lawsuits have construed Footnote Four to encompass sundry groups as “discrete and insular minorities” entitled to judicial protection.128 For example, relying upon Footnote                                                  124 See. e.g., Lea Brilmayer, Carolene, Conflicts, and the Fate of the Inside-Outsider, 134 U.

A list of such physical/behavioral trait-based minorities “arguably includes not only groups defined in terms of race and national origin,” but also Sane/Mentally Ill, Rich/Poor, Heterosexual/Homosexual, and Adult/Child.131 The Carolene Products identity-based binary in Footnote Four utilizes and reaffirms the binary as the base of recognition, reasoning, interpretation, and adjudication.132 When articulated in 1938, race was perhaps the clearest, preeminent binary-based identity signifier that the Court (and the lower federal and state courts) could emplace within Footnote Four’s interpretive architecture.133 In light of Reconstruction and the Post-Reconstruction South’s implementation of Jim Crow laws, the Black/White binary, which could readily be distilled from the historical experience of both races, fit into the “discrete and insular”134 criteria of Footnote Four, thereby triggering judicial scrutiny and protection. As construed by the Court, equal protection has been squarely built upon a binary-based                                                  position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process”). 129 Washington v.

Beyond Footnote Four    Footnote Four has become part of a larger legal meta-discourse on how the Court will view identity, generally speaking, and this of course impacts lower federal and state courts as well. The Court’s employment of binary-based identity signifiers is part of a long history of race-conscious legislation and judicial opinions.136 The modern manifestation of affirmative action, for instance, which began with the Philadelphia Plan137 in the late 1960s and has been the basis of racial identity-based cases such as Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.,138 Metro                                                  135 See Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v.

J. SOC. 633, 635 (1997). The 1969 Philadelphia Plan has been described as “‘the first effective use of affirmative action to implement civil rights legislation directing employers to guarantee equal employment opportunity.’ As the first highly visible federal government affirmative action initiative in the wake of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Philadelphia Plan crystallized arguments of both affirmative action’s early opponents and its early supporters. Just as past policies shaped how both sides crafted their arguments about the Philadelphia Plan, these arguments and their resolution fed forward to help shape later government employment policy.” Id. 138 City of Richmond v.

Weber,140 is thoroughly steeped in binary-based identity. Binary-based identity has been the basis for articulating, examining, discussing, debating, arguing, and impassioned contestation over what constitutes correct/proper law and policy.141 It is an indispensable part of the legislative and interpretive process.  In the case of the binary-based identity signifier, despite its simplification of complex reality, it has managed to remain a viable aspect of the legal enterprise in adjudicating cases and controversies because, despite the artificial nature of dyadic frameworks, as the Court noted long ago, “[c]ontroversies have arisen and will no doubt arise again in respect of the proper classification of individuals in border line cases.”142 Indeed, the binary has proven resilient in the face of progressive change, and has been (and can be) maintained to retain the status quo regarding identity-based signifiers. For example, in Gong Lum v. Rice,143 the Court, in affirming an example of segregation based on race, declared that  [m]ost of the cases cited arose, it is true, over the establishment of separate schools as between white pupils and black pupils;                                                  139 Metro Broad., Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 552–53 (1990), overruled by Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 201 (1995). Justice Brennan’s majority opinion declared: “We hold that benign race-conscious measures mandated by Congress—even if those measures are not 'remedial' in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal discrimination—are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives.” Id. at 564–65. For an example of gender and its binary nature, see Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976) (“[C]lassifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.”).  140 See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 204 (1979) (analyzing Title VII, the Court declared that, it “would be ironic indeed if a law triggered by a Nation’s concern over centuries of racial injustice and intended to improve the lot of those who had ‘been excluded from the American dream for so long’ constituted the first legislative prohibition of all voluntary, private, race-conscious efforts to abolish traditional patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy.”). 141 See, e.g., Greta Fowler Snyder, Multivalent Recognition: Between Fixity and Fluidity in Identity Politics, 74 THE J.

In the case of Kosilek v. Spencer,145 discussed supra, its reversal by the First Circuit146 could be recast in terms of protecting and reifying the sex/gender binary that is essential to the continuity that has undergirded how the law conceives and interprets legal protections for identity groups, especially “discrete and insular minorities.”147 The tension and dissonance between the district court’s legal reasoning and conclusions and the appellate court’s reasoning and conclusions may point to the “collective anxiety in our culture surrounding gender, and anyone who may bring light to the inadequacy of the gender binary, by blurring the lines between ‘male’ and ‘female.’”148 Judge Thompson, in her dissent also directly confronts the conflict between the integrity of the binary and challenges to its usage in grounding the law’s approach to identity-based signifiers and the judicial provision of remedies and protections.149 Judge Thompson contends that the majority’s opinion “aggrieves an already marginalized community, and enables correctional systems to further postpone their adjustment to the crumbling gender binary.”150 In the case of the sex/gender binary:   It is widely accepted in the dominant culture that there are two sexes and two genders and no room for anything in between. We organize our daily interactions, our values, our social institutions, the law, our very understanding of reality, around these assumptions. One is not fully cognizable as human without a designation as male or female.

Yet as gender theorists have long known, this binary system is not natural, but socially and politically constructed.151  Kosilek v. Spencer points to the contest that is taking place in the realms of law and policy between time-tested binaries and the stability and “objective” basis they provide vis-à-vis identity signifiers.152 The case exemplifies the challenges based on fluidity and inclusiveness that the binary eschews by its dyadic nature of making complex states of affairs more manageable for the purpose of pragmatic and prudential management of the administration of justice.153 When moving beyond the binary, certain subjects and groups may experience serious cognitive dissonance as to what is believed about the world and one’s place in it—as well as conceptions of Self, Other, and World.154 What defines the ethos and essence of what it means to be and why, may also be called into question for those same groups. With the introduction of alternative voices, interpretations, worldviews, and experiences, the simplified binary becomes subject to destabilization. When “one recognizes the emergence of multiple different voices—including … feminist, critical race, and more recently, gay and lesbian theorists—then modernist claims to identify                                                  151 Dunnavant, supra note 23, at 20.

It is crucial, therefore, to identify and describe [the binary] and to demonstrate how it binds and organizes racial discourse, limiting both the scope and the range of legitimate viewpoints in that discourse.”158  In the context of racial identity and the binary framework within which it has been emplaced, the law has relied very heavily upon the Black/White identity signifier, to the point where other people of color such as Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans may (or appear to) drop out, and all that remains is an unadulterated Black/White binary for assessing redress and protections for the historically oppressed and exploited.159 Yet, other people of color and other groups deemed racially Other have suffered the same effects of race-based genocide (e.g., Native Americans), prejudice and discrimination in every aspect                                                  155 STEPHEN M.

In Hernandez, the Court declared that the “Fourteenth Amendment is not directed solely against discrimination due to a ‘two-class theory’—that is, based upon differences between ‘white’ and ‘Negro.’”169 Describing some of the racial prejudice and discrimination faced by Mexican-Americans at the time, the Court stated that the   testimony of . . . officials and citizens contained the admission that residents of the community distinguished between ‘white’ and ‘Mexican.’ The participation of persons of Mexican descent in business and community groups was shown to be slight. Until very recent times, children of Mexican descent were required to attend a segregated school for the first four grades.170   Even where the historical White/Black binary is broadened to include other races, the integrity of the binary is nonetheless preserved to some significant degree, and the courts are able to expand protections to the Other in such a schema.171 This dynamic seems to pervade the courts’ approach to inclusiveness and diversity as far as expansion of remedies and protections based on identity is concerned.172   IV. POWER DYNAMICS OF THE BINARY: HOW THE BINARY CONSTRUCTS A TRUTH REGIME  The historical modernist binary that the law has employed is based upon a classificatory schema that builds legal actuality from a politicized construct that is the product of relations of power. The historical or traditional binary creates a point on which identity-based signifiers can be employed to settle legal cases and controversies that involve decision-making processes being based on simplified identity-                                                 168 See cases cited supra notes 162–67. 169 Hernandez, 347 U.S. at 478. 170 Id. at 479 (internal citations omitted). 171 See Robert M.

Astrada & Astrada 2018]   REEXAMINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE BINARY 205  based signifiers.173 A prominent example of this can be observed in equal protection doctrine and law, which is identity-based jurisprudence.174 Judicial remedies and protections rooted in equal protection hinge   on the identity trait—such as race or gender—implicated by an alleged act of discrimination. In those instances, the identity trait stands in to represent a set of assumptions about the group it describes: Because that group has been subjected to discrimination or politically marginalized in the past, or because its identifying characteristic is irrelevant to its members’ ability to contribute to or participate in society, the law is particularly sensitive to state action that targets such groups.175  A definitive counterpoint therefore emerges in the law concerning identity-based signifiers. For example, the Court has posited and built upon a racial basis176 for upholding177 or modifying178 the legal understanding of race-based educational access policies. The federal courts (as well as state courts) are bound by the binaries that the Supreme Court employs to expound upon what the Constitution means.179 The employment of the binary-based identity signifier thus enables a power dynamic to emerge that creates a space that is at once                                                  173 See Richard T. Ford, Race as Culture? Why Not?, 47 UCLA L. REV. 1803, 1805 (2000). “Racism must not be understood as a set of practices that targets a group because of some preexisting characteristic of its members, but instead as a set of practices that establishes racial hierarchy and assigns individuals to distinctive statuses within that hierarchy.” Id. Racial identity—defining and applying it—is a product and producer of power. 174 See Terrance Sandalow, Judicial Protection of Minorities, 75 MICH. L.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 17:2  determined by, and determines, identity structures as they are manifested in a subject’s actions and thoughts as they enter the realms of law, policy, and institutions. “[I]n using identity as its organizing principle, law is confined to operating within the very structures that subordinate and is similarly confined to focusing on the product rather than the cause of inequality.”180  The binary has thus been and continues to be the site where the courts construct legal identity.181 It is also the site where the political contestation for the power to define identity takes place, and thus has a formative effect on how law conceptualizes, processes, and adjudicates cases and controversies. The political and legal dimensions of the binary thus establish the binary as a fulcrum wherein limits are set as to how an identity manifests in law and society.182 That there is a call for moving “Beyond He/She”183 provides a clear example of how a traditional identity signifier (Male/Female) is being undermined, destabilized, and ultimately how attempts are being made to dispense with the binary that has structured law and policy. The law, however, despite the pitfalls that attach from subscribing to the binary, has relied upon the basic binary to establish legal schema to protect identity, to remedy violations of law based on specific identity signifiers.184 The persistence of the binary, despite calls to blur or discard the identity signifiers that create an enclosed and identifiable identity space, is illustrative of the complex processes that are at work in the evolution of thought pertaining to identity and the configuration of identity politics and the law.185 Yet it seems that those who rail against the identity signifier dwell within the structures of the Other, in law, society, and identity politics as construed by the modernist identity signifier.                                                   180 Lucas, supra note 175, at 1608. 181 See ROBERT L.

Astrada & Astrada 2018]   REEXAMINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE BINARY 207  The foregoing presents a central question:  how can (or rather, should) the law go forward with identity-based signifiers without importing the negative trappings of said signifiers? Similarly, how can the law adapt or reconfigure identity-based signifiers, which are the basis of equal protection law,186 among other realms of law and practice, so that the courts can fashion a pragmatic and prudential mechanism that can withstand change and that transcends the historicity of identity-based signifiers that serve as benchmarks for measuring progress? The identity signifier appears to be at odds with political and sociocultural efforts to undermine and discard the binaries that have permeated modern law and history. In the case of the standard racial binary of Black/White, for instance, one commentator contends that,   [t]here are at least three reasons, however, why an exclusive focus on Blacks and Whites is not justified. First, it is important to work to eradicate all racism, not just the racism experienced by Blacks. Second, it is wrong to assume that racism against [other racial identity groups such as Latinos is] simply a less . . . virulent form of the same racism experienced by Blacks. . . .  Finally, our national demographics are changing significantly.187   In the case of the traditional racial binary of White/Black, for instance, some commentators contend that   [t]he Court has considered race to be the principal protected characteristic under the Constitution. The Court has, therefore, encouraged an underinclusive, binary discourse about race in which the primary views expressed are the white and the [black] . . . We are a long way from . . . legal discourse that includes all the voices that must be heard.188    The binary, whether or not one agrees with the foregoing contention, remains the basis upon which the law is or is not able to conceive and                                                  186 Id. at 1618. 187 Perea, The Black/White Binary, supra note 158, at 167.  188 Juan F.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 17:2  incorporate a juridical subject into preexisting legal-rational constructs to adjudicate and administer justice.189 There perhaps is a growing frustration with attempts to find and posit identities that can clearly encompass relevant and unique criteria, such as the discrete and insular qualities or traits of a group, that neatly ties together such traits with an identity that the law can then act on and build upon.190 Before the law, one has to be Either/Or, one or the other.191 A juridical subject stands before the law as a legal subject infused with a binary nature: in criminal matters, one can only be “guilty” or “not guilty,” in civil matters one’s claim is found credible or dismissed. In effect, the binary re-imagines the subject and the case or controversy as “rational and orderly but obscure[s] the power mediations at play.”192 The binary has become inextricably integrated into the process “of converting individuals and circumstances to cases”193 so that the courts may engage and participate in the meta-narratives of politicized identity that structure the binary-based identity signifier. In the Slaughter House Cases,194 when considering the Reconstruction Amendments, that is, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, the Court stated,   We do not say that no one else but the negro can share in this protection . . . Undoubtedly while negro slavery alone was in the mind of the Congress which proposed the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that                                                  189 Id.; Lucas, supra note 175, at 1619 (noting that the current legal construction of equal protection is based on general categories of identity). 190 See Perea, Ethnicity and the Constitution, supra note 188, at 573 (arguing that the law’s current racial discrimination paradigm is inadequate adequately to encompass ethnicity). 191 Id. 192 Jennifer Lee, Binary Determination of Guilt or Innocence: Reading Between the Lines of People v.

Astrada & Astrada 2018]   REEXAMINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE BINARY 209  protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent.195   Yet, even when the binary is expanded, that is, stretched beyond its initial formulation, the underlying base and resultant conversion of subjects into juridical subjects remains.196 For example, the White/Black binary, even though it has been expanded to include other races/ethnicities, retains its reductionist character and cultural understanding of politicized identity. The Black identity signifier as it has been construed in the law since the founding of the U.S. in the larger White/Black binary continues to inform key terms and rules of formation such as prejudice, discrimination, hate speech, and racial animus.197 The binary has thus proven resilient – despite its pitfalls. It seems that, despite efforts to make identity more fluid, porous, less exclusive in nature, the law requires some degree of the opposite of the foregoing to maintain its ability to adjudicate identity-based cases. Herein lies the rub. What is or should be the fate of the binary going forward?   CONCLUSION  The law and the courts, generally speaking, treat identity in a similar fashion: one either does or does not qualify for remedies, protections, etc., of the law based on whether a subject fits or does not fit into a legal identity signifier.198 Why are those the only alternatives? Why can a subject not be neither or both? The law cultivates historically based identity binaries when converting sociocultural and economic realities into legal discourse. Subjects find themselves emplaced within politicized binary identities; an identity is manufactured and given to subjects by various elites, be it political, economic, social, or legal                                                  195 Id. at 72. 196 Perea, Ethnicity and the Constitution, supra note 188, at 608–11 (stating that, despite expanding the equal protection clause to ethnicity, apparent court confusion hampered “meaningful protection”). 197 Perea, The Black/White Binary, supra note 188, at 155. 198 See Lucas, supra note 175, at 1626–27 (stating that the Court’s defining of identity requires the Court to determine who does or does not fit within the category). Astrada & Astrada  210  U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 17:2  actors.199 A disconnect exists between the subject and history: if the racial binary is undermined and subjects are free to choose their racial identities and affiliations independent of whether or not a subject possesses what was once the requisite experience that stems from a racial identity signifier, then the law will find itself in a predicament. It becomes a conflict surrounding the meaning of identity, rather than an exercise of inclusion and giving voice and substance to an identity group based on modernist-based identity signifiers. The problem with retaining symbols of identity is that they are imprinted solely in an historically lateral sense, as lynchpins of identity, devoid of the historical culmination of social relationships.200 In discarding the experiential elements that ground an identity signifier—and the experiential dimension is by nature binary in that it is premised on a this/that, either/or cognitive framework—what results is a detached and exclusionary basis of identity that the subject cannot grasp.201 The contradictory nature of identity seems to be characterized by the notion that there is and is not a center, a basis, for what one is. Yet the law views actuality in terms of categories, classifications, identity-based signifiers. The Self breathes life into the historical structures of identity, so it is both historically determined and irrefutably existential. To deconstruct binaries without discarding them, i.e., to identify and explicitly acknowledge the deep effect that the binary has and the serious distortions and limitations that are immanent within it, we can begin a process of productively “destabilizing” binaries. 202 “In so doing, these binaries can be recognized as dynamic rather than static, fundamentally contingent rather than universal, and                                                  199 See, e.g., Lucas, supra note 175, at 1605 (stating that the Equal Protection Clause’s use of identity as the basis of its doctrine can “force people to identify in a particular way to lay claim to legal protection”). 200 See Charlie Gerstein, Comment, What Can the Brothers Malone Teach Us About Fisher v. University of Texas?, 111 MICH. L. REV. FIRST IMPRESSIONS 97, 98–99 (2014) (stating that each state had a system for defining who was considered Black, despite a person’s contrary self-identification); see also Andrés Acebo, Life, Liberty & the Pursuit of Whiteness: A Revolution of Identity Politics in America, 2 COLUM. J. RACE & L. 149, 153–54 (2012) (noting that the Court in Ozawa v. United States, 260 U.S. 178 (1922) stated that absent clearly classifying people by race would create problematic racial overlap). 201 See Lucas, supra note 175, at 1627 (noting that legal identity categories are “inherently exclusionary” and result in over-simplification). 202 Tata, supra note 97, at 427. Astrada & Astrada 2018]   REEXAMINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE BINARY 211  synergistic rather than discrete and oppositional . . . binaries are revealed as fluid, mutable, and, protean.”203  The need for order, stability, clarity, and pragmatic and functional bases upon which to adjudicate issues and administer justice can be acknowledged without the trappings of objectivity that renders the binary a rigid and overly artificial and distortionary construct. Judicial opinions encompass “choice and order; implicit routine and explicit normative principle; analysis and intuition; individualization and consistency; rationality and emotion . . . These qualities co-exist dynamically, are synergistic, and inhabit each other.”204 While it is pragmatic and useful to construct notions such as binary identity to create the illusion of concretized identity classifications, the world filtered through such classifications reflects a model of a “real world”—a model that is useful for dealing with the world but that is not in fact reflective of any objective truths about the world.205 The model, the binary, manufactures truth-value, but it is also subject, like all models and constructs, to revision and reconfiguration. The contradictory nature of identity, in the locus of a subject that shapes the world and is shaped by it, may clear a space for accountability in the culturally relativist landscape contoured by law and policy.                                                    203 Id.  204 Id. 205 RICHARD DAWKINS, THE GOD DELUSION 416–17 (2008).
