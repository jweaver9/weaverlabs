    "abstract": "Abstract: This presentation will explore the relationship between LGBTQ+ identification and risk for problem gambling. Research has long identified in sexual minority groups higher rates of most mental health indicators, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, and substance misuse. However, little attention has focused on their risk of developing gambling problems. This study used an epidemiological sample of adults (N = 3,414), 6% of whom identified as LGBTQ+ (n = 216). Bivariate comparisons found those who identified as LGBTQ+ had significantly higher problems with gambling, alcohol, drugs, anxiety, depression, and a wide range of behaviors (e.g., binge eating, pornography use). Furthermore, a logistic regression found a significant interaction effect between LGBTQ+ status and age, such that the odds of having gambling disorder (PGSI â‰¥ 8) increased with age for individuals who identified as LGBTQ+ when controlling for demographic, mental health, and other addiction variables. Among those who gambled in the LGBTQ+ population, anxiety and/or problems with drugs were most associated with high-risk gambling.\nImplications: These results underscore the need to screen for gambling problems across all health, mental health, and community sectors where individuals in the LGBTQ+ community, particularly older adults, could be identified and triaged to treatment.\nPresenter Bios: \nJackie Stanmyre, MSW, ABD, is the Assistant Director of the Center for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University.
