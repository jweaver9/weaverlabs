Buist * INTRODUCTION Although not the first time LGBTQ folks fought back against po-lice authority,1 the Stonewall Riots or Stonewall Rebellion, is com-monly referred to as the genesis of the LGBTQ Pride movement in the United States. A lesser-known fact is that these riots were led by the transgender community—a community which today faces unheard of rates of violence, especially transgender women of color.2 Transgender women of color are murdered in the United States at rates that continue to increase. This Essay will explore unprecedented violence against the transgender community and the LGBTQ+3 community at large, especially as it relates to the action and inaction of the criminal legal system. In an attempt to move beyond mainstream activism and research, this Essay will examine queer criminology, which explores the experiences of the      *    Assistant Professor, Grand Valley State University School of Criminal Justice.  1.

For example, queer criminol-ogy studies the persistent distrust that the LGBTQ+ community has of police5 as well as the experiences of LGBTQ+ identified po-lice officers and other agents within the criminal legal system. Fur-ther, as the current Administration continues to roll back the rights and liberties of the LGBTQ+ community, there must be a focus on how past and present policies continue to negatively im-pact LGBTQ+ people at the micro and macro levels.6 This Essay will also pay special attention to LGBTQ+ youth and transgender people of color.  Criminal law, as it relates to the rights and liberties of United States citizens, implies a great many things—perhaps the greatest of these is the assumption of equality in the eyes of the law or due process.7 Criminology, or more specifically criminological theories that examine crimination through a critical lens, has highlighted the disconnect between criminal law and criminology.8 In the 1960s, theoretical approaches related to crime began to focus on more institutional level issues primarily emphasizing class and is-sues of power.9 While critical criminology expanded the previous   4.

Feminist scholars soon demanded produc-tion of research from an intersectional frame of reference.12 It is important to briefly highlight both critical and feminist criminolo-gies as scholars have recognized that these approaches have been influential to the development of queer criminology.13 There are surely other influencing factors that contributed to the advent of queer criminology in the United States, such as queer theory and cultural theorists and criminologists from the United Kingdom and Australia.14 Queer criminology has been and may be applied theo-retically and practically through examining the differences from the mainstream in the research itself, as well as examining the ex- RADICAL CRIMINOLOGY: CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON CRIME, POWER & IDENTITY (4th ed. 2006).  10.

LGBTQ RIGHTS IN CRIMINAL LAW In the broadest terms, criminal law relates to the laws used to punish folks who commit crimes. Our criminal legal system is made up of police, courts, and corrections, and all branches of the criminal legal system are responsible in part for achieving “jus-tice.”16 Crime prevention, investigation, apprehension, and so on are expected to be achieved in policing, while courts are the symbol of our due process and sentencing.17 Finally, corrections is trusted to punish: typically to achieve retribution, to deter, and to rehabil-itate, either separately or working with other approaches such as reintegration or restorative justice.18 However, it is the role of law enforcement, whether they are directly involved as offenders or vic-tims or merely as citizens that most people are familiar with. The ways in which police interact with the public and ultimately en-force laws have what could be devastating results for the individu-als who come into contact with law enforcement. This is strikingly true for LGBTQ+ identified folks as queer people have historically and presently experienced the criminal legal system much differ-ently than the majority, especially queer folks of color and/or queer folks living in poverty, queer youth, and specifically transgender individuals.  First, we have to ask if LGBTQ+ folks are committing a dispro-portionate amount of crime that would likely draw contact with law enforcement, and, if this is the case, what types of crimes queer folks are committing that would necessitate contact with the crim-inal legal system. We could draw from myriad research sources to   15.

Further, law enforcement interaction with LGBTQ+ youth and LGBTQ+ people of color is likely to be disproportionate, if for no other reason than the high rates of homelessness experienced in the LGBTQ+ youth and transgender populations. Research con-tinues to highlight the high rates of homelessness experienced by LGBTQ+ youth across the United States, especially youth of color.20 As reported by the Center for American Progress, ninety-nine percent of the queer youth it serviced in Detroit at the Ruth Ellis Center, which provides both short- and long-term housing and support for LGBTQ youth, are African American.21 The report goes on to highlight what other research has continued to indicate as well: a high percentage of homeless LGBTQ youth often must resort to survival crimes, including survival sex, and are more likely to have contact with the police and ultimately the criminal legal system.22 We also know that transgender people in particular more than likely will experience homelessness in their lives as The National Center for Transgender Equality has reported that  one in five transgender individuals have experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. Family rejection and discrimination and vi-olence have contributed to a large number of transgender and other LGBQ-identified[sic] youth who are homeless in the United States—an estimated 20–40% of the more than 1.6 million homeless youth.23 Similar to all people experiencing homelessness, many LGBTQ+ folks, youth and adult alike, will commit survival crimes that can   19.

Some survival crimes may be considered more serious violations of the criminal code, while others may warrant a fine—i.e., the difference between stealing food from a grocery store versus loitering or sleeping on a park bench.  We continue to see the connection between homelessness and criminal legal system involvement: often times homelessness leads to incarceration, and release from prison often leads to homeless-ness.26 Living without shelter increases one’s interaction with law enforcement and increases the probability of victimization and of-fending. In addition to researching homeless youth, Hunt and Moodie-Mills have explored the disproportionate number of LGBT youth in the juvenile justice system and noted that “the system of-ten does more harm by unfairly criminalizing these youth—impos-ing harsh school sanctions, labeling them as sex offenders, or de-taining them for minor offenses—in addition to subjecting them to discriminatory and harmful treatment that deprives them of their basic civil rights.”27   24.

The impact of criminal law and how certain populations are policed is integral in any discussion regarding LGBTQ+ folks and the crimi-nal legal system. Police are well aware of the populations that are most visible or most likely to be in any particular area or location in which they patrol, and police discretion can have a powerful im-pact on queer folks of any age, race, or identity, in either a power-fully positive way or a dreadfully negative way, with the latter, po-tentially contributing to the disproportionately high rates of incarcerated sexual minorities (“SM”).28 As the Williams Institute reports, lesbian, gay, and bisexual Americans are three times more likely to be incarcerated than the general United States popula-tion.29  Often, we focus on the over-policing of the LGBTQ+ community; however, we would be remiss not to include discussion of the lack of policing in some areas. For instance, research continues to tell us that intimate partner violence (“IPV”) is just as prevalent if not more prevalent in same-sex relationships, yet the enforcement of criminal law regarding arrests of such offenders is limited.30 Stud-ies have shown that officers have difficulty assessing same-sex IPV as such.31 This difficulty is perhaps an example of the need for ad-ditional training and policy implementation in law enforcement that could assist officers not only to recognize the victims and of-fenders of IPV, but also to recognize that value judgments should not be a part of police work.32 Yet research continues to show us   28.

Given pervading het-eronormative assumptions surrounding IPV, police training would benefit from a continued focus on dismantling misinformation sur-rounding SM IPV and addressing the durability of heteronormative IPV myths.34 While the support for the LGBTQ+ population has increased in recent years,35 the criminal legal system in particular continues to be dominated by straight, white, working- to middle-class males, who value traditional masculinity and whose organizational cul-ture is rooted in patriarchal paramilitary design.36 This hegemonic masculinity may be problematic when addressing the needs of mi-nority groups with regards to IPV, as exampled above. As Part II will discuss, the culture of policing does not foster community re-lationships but rather distrust and suspicion, especially with vul-nerable populations, among them law enforcement agents who identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community.  II.  LGBTQ RIGHTS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT Research continues to show us that law enforcement has a his-tory of discriminatory practices towards people of color and other minority and marginalized populations, such as the LGBTQ+ pop-ulation.

Although limited in scope, existing studies both in the United States and abroad continue to reveal queer folks’ distrust of police and in turn polices’ distrust of queer folks.39 Law enforcement, in general, is taught, either intentionally or via police socialization, to distrust and be suspicious of the public. This suspicion and dis-trust can save an officer’s life; however, one must examine the per-sistent distrust that law enforcement has of marginalized popula-tions as related to historically significant stereotypes and archetypes that, while antiquated, persist today either overtly or covertly and contribute to bias both explicitly and implicitly.  For example, consider anti-cross-dressing laws. In 1848, Colum-bus, Ohio’s anti-cross-dressing law stated that individuals were prohibited from being in public places “in a dress not belonging to his or her sex.”40 In 1944, Detroit, Michigan, banned men from be-ing “dress[ed] of the opposite sex” in public or private spaces.41 In the United States, these ordinances for the most part have been amended or overturned, but their history has a lasting impact on LGBTQ+ folks, especially transgender people who continue to be brutally victimized. These impersonation or masquerade laws have contributed to the lie that queer folks, again, especially transgender folks, are deceptive by nature and not to be trusted, which in turn exacerbates the distrust between law enforcement   37.

As indicated by Chase Strangio:  In Phoenix, Arizona, you can be arrested for repeatedly stopping and engaging a passerby in conversation. This may, under Phoenix law, be evidence that you are “manifesting” an intent to engage in prosti-tution. Of course, this could also be evidence that you are lost or can-vassing for a political group or simply talking about the weather. The difference between “innocent” and “criminal” behavior often comes down to how a person looks.43 The case most associated with this law is that of Monica Jones, a student at Arizona State University who identifies as a black transgender woman.44 After Jones was arrested in May of 2014, she stated that she had been repeatedly harassed by police and suspected of solicitation on four occasions, including while walking to the grocery store and talking with a friend on the sidewalk.45  It is important to remember that the Stonewall Rebellion re-sponded to over-policing of the LGBTQ+ community, and as previ-ously mentioned, it has become the most well-known activist mo-ment in our history—however, activism was not a new phenomenon in the queer landscape before, during, or after Stone-wall.46 Police have long-viewed the queer community not as a group in need of understanding and support, but in need of surveillance and punishment.47 Take into consideration the little-known story of James Clay Jr. as retold by Timothy Stewart-Winter: In November 1970, after a lengthy foot chase, two Chicago police of-ficers apprehended James Clay Jr., a twenty-four-year-old African American man, and fired eight shots into his back, killing him.

LGBTQ+ police officers, particu-larly gay, male officers and transgender, male-to-female officers, continue to report experiencing harassment and discrimination on the job.53 These issues are not limited to law enforcement but also   48.

Larger departments serving a more diverse commu-nity may be more open and accepting of minority populations while smaller departments in rural areas may not.

Just as training and policies must be effectively implemented (and this is never a guarantee) for law enforcement regarding their treatment of the LGBTQ+ community, these same lessons must be applied to how law enforcement agents treat each other. For exam-ple, Tania Israel and colleagues explored the use of what they re-ferred to as “LGBTQ-Affirming Policing.”67 Their discussion reiter-ates the problematic history between LGBTQ+ people and law enforcement, including the events that took place at Stonewall in 1969.68 The research study used role playing and group discussion to introduce effective working strategies with the LGBTQ+ com-munity.69 The results were mixed, but perhaps somewhat surpris-ingly so given previous research, as many of the law enforcement responses were LGBTQ-affirming. Therefore, this research could be developed into an approach that the criminal legal system would be encouraged to implement.70  In another study, Israel and colleagues assessed the perceptions that law enforcement officers had of LGBTQ training.71 They found that officers are both receptive and resistant to LGBTQ diversity training. Among the resistance themes found by the researchers, law enforcement participants conveyed questions about the re-search on law enforcement’s interaction with LGBTQ populations, doubting the accuracy of the research.72 Officers also felt as though they already treat all populations equally, and that they do not have personal bias but maintained concern about how they are per-ceived by the public. Further, the research found that the law en-forcement participants held a variety of beliefs about LGBTQ peo-ple including that they use discrimination allegations to get out of trouble, want special treatment, do not understand the police, and that accusing officers of bias can be detrimental.73 They also felt as   67.

Offic-ers who may not be out on the job may certainly hesitate to ever be out on the job if they observe the behavior of their fellow officers who may be questioning the legitimacy of LGBTQ+ concerns, the need for training, or the facts that are presented to them about LGBTQ+ issues at the macro and micro levels. This certainly speaks to the experiences of officers like Jay Brome and Keith Wildhaber. Yet, officers who identify as LGBTQ+ often still persist on the job, even when encountering discrimination, harassment, and even physical threats or violence. This speaks to their commit-ment to their roles in law enforcement and mirrors the historical discrimination that women have experienced in law enforcement and in other professions that are male dominated and heteronor-mative.

Although activism was taking root decades be-fore the 1960s, much of our attention is given to this decade as the civil rights movement, women’s rights movement, and queer rights movement rightfully garnered more attention in popular media, courtrooms, and classrooms across the country.79 This was true for criminology students at the University of Berkeley, as they are of-ten cited as a leading force behind the radical and eventually crit-ical criminology movements in the United States.80 These folks, along with other criminologists and sociologists, argued for the im-portance of and implementation of research that focused on the roles of the powerful, ruling classes in the United States and in doing so influenced the work of feminist scholars who called for a gender-centered criminology.81 Today, with the influence of critical and feminist criminologies, the concepts and the scholars who have championed them, and the influence of scholars in the United Kingdom and global South, queer criminology has come to the United States and focuses on creating change and shifting atten-tion from the straight-stream and mainstream to queering the world of criminology and in doing so centering populations that have often been ignored.82    79.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE APPLICATION OF QUEER CRIMINOLOGY  Queer criminology can be defined in several different ways, but what we most often see are definitions associated with its theoret-ical application related to the importance of doing criminological research differently and moving beyond the mainstream theories that persistently research only straight men, to a more practical application that seeks to highlight the experiences of LGBTQ+ folks as victims, offenders, and professionals working in the crimi-nal legal system.83 These general definitions are important to con-sider as we continue to strive to shed light on the ways in which queer folks experience not only the world in which we live but spe-cifically the ways in which we experience the criminal legal system, and how queer folks are often treated with distrust, disrespect, or are outright ignored in all branches of the system as previously highlighted.  Queer criminology calls for criminologists to move outside of their mainstream boxes and include queer folks at the center of research, not just as victims, which is of course important but does not tell the entire story.84 For instance, Vanessa Panfil, in her in-depth qualitative and ethnographic work on gay, male gang mem-bers, highlights that queer folks can also be participants in crime, noting that unlike “much of existing criminological research . . . male gang members and active offenders are [not] exclusively het-erosexual.”85 Jordan Blair Woods has used his much cited research on homosexual deviancy theory to call attention to previous re-search failings that focused only on what he refers to as the devi-ance-centered element, which assumed that all queer folks were deviant and the invisibility element that posits research on queer  nology, 56 BRIT.

It has the ability to foster activism that has been missing in the field of criminology for so long. After all, as scholars who immerse themselves in developing pedagogy, research, and a variety of methodologies to add to the depth and breadth of knowledge we feel we should all have regard-ing the criminal legal system and how folks are affected by the criminal legal system, scholars should be on the front of the battle lines leading the charge for change! As noted by Matthew Ball, “it is clear that queer criminology involves scholarship and activism that seeks to achieve the related goals of responding to social and criminal injustices in LGBTIQ lives, and addressing the oversights and misrepresentations of those lives within criminology.”87 Fur-ther, as noted earlier, LGBTQ+ youth are arguably the most vul-nerable population today, and when viewing their experiences through an intersectional lens that argument is strengthened.88 Therefore, there is an undeniable need to address issues that these youth are experiencing and work towards breaking the cycle of vi-olence and victimization they will no doubt face in their adult lives as they enter and exit the criminal legal system. The influence of feminist criminology cannot be ignored. For instance, Lindsay Kahle extends the work of feminist scholars Daly and Chesney-Lind,89 who outlined five elements of feminist criminology, to in-clude queer criminology concepts—Kahle’s additions are italicized:  1.  Gender is not a natural fact but a complex social, historical, and cultural product that is intertwined with sexual orientation and is a source of heteronormative power. 2.  Gender and sexual orientation order social life and become institu-tionalized in fundamental ways that create and reproduce matrices of heterosexual power.   86. Woods, supra note 15, at 17.   87.

Gender relations and constructs of masculinity and femininity are not symmetrical but are based on an organizing principle of heterosex-ual and cisgender men’s superiority and social, political, and economic dominance over nonheterosexual and noncisgender men and women. 4.  Systems of knowledge reflect cisgender men’s views of the natural and social world; the production of knowledge is gendered and sexual-ized and was perpetuated during the “masculinity turn” within femi-nist criminology. 5. (W)omen, gender nonconforming, and nonheterosexual individu-als should be at the center of intellectual inquiry, not peripheral, in-visible appendages to heterosexual cisgender men.90 These additions, if implemented beyond theory and employed through practical application, could impact policy as it is related to the queer community, including LGBTQ+ youth who are an under-served population amongst the underserved. When we look at these issues through an activist lens, youth are often times left without voice in the choices they have and without agency in the criminal legal system.91 That is not to say that youth are com-pletely without advocates, but those advocates must be fully versed in the unique and intersectional experiences of queer youth. Often-times, youth are treated as if they have no decision-making skills, they have yet to develop their identities, or they are unaware of their sexual orientation.92 The longer we continue to silence our youth the more devastated they will be by the inaction or action of the criminal legal system and beyond. Those with power and au-thority over them will ultimately do them a disservice if they are not aware of issues such as the high percentages of LGBTQ+ youth who experience homelessness as previously discussed.93 Many of these youth do not choose to leave their homes to live on the streets without shelter, without support, and with the strain they experi-ence that contributes to their offending, but often once they come out to their family members they are kicked out of their homes.94    90.

The ways in which we conduct research and apply research is also impacted at the institutional, ideological, and interpersonal levels as well.  Scholars who work with and for the LGBTQ+ population and practice different approaches to the application of a queer crimi-nology may disagree on its most accurate definition,108 but most would agree that bringing these issues to light is imperative and drives the research and ultimately the application of the work, which may indeed be one of the most effective ways to implement change within the criminal legal system, at all levels. Beginning, however, with law enforcement is key. As indicated, most people are aware of law enforcement; even if one does not come into direct contact with the criminal legal system in their lives, the authority of the police is seen nearly every day of our lives. Rightly or wrongly, law enforcement will often be the first representatives of state authority that civilians look to for assistance or to blame when things malfunction.109 Many of us still maintain a need for police authority in our lives and on a societal level as well, and even though this may be true, this does not mean that we should not be able to analyze and discuss the role of law enforcement through a critical lens. Regardless of the personal level of doubt that some may have regarding the performance of law enforcement in our   105.

CONCLUSION Has there been change? Yes, most certainly, and the research provided here gives some hope that LGBTQ-affirming tactics work and continue to develop. Police departments throughout the United States continue to assign their departments LGBTQ+ liai-son officers to build bridges between the queer community and law enforcement.112 Queer criminology has already explored and drawn attention to the former invisibility of LGBTQ+ people in crimino-logical research, but there still remains a much needed move to apply the theoretical concepts and the research that has already been done. Also, the discussion should broaden to include different disciplines outside of criminology—this suggestion is perhaps eas-ier to accomplish than the criminal legal system applying the em-pirical knowledge rooted in queer criminology. Conversely, queer criminologists, along with the entire field, should take into consid-eration the professional experiences and knowledge of criminal le-gal and other social service providers as their knowledge is integral to increasing the research pool and impacting the lives of margin-alized populations such as the LGBTQ+ community.    110.

It is important to pay attention to the work being done around the country. As we wit-ness the youngest generations following in the activist footsteps of those before them, continuing the work is imperative, especially when we examine the extraordinarily high rates of violence against transgender people, especially transgender women of color. It is es-sential for us to continue the work that so many others have begun, to stand on the shoulders of these activist giants if you will, and create change, big and small, personal and political.

For example, queer criminology studies the persistent distrust that the LGBTQ+ community has of police as well as the experiences of LGBTQ+ identified police officers and other agents within the criminal legal system. Further, as the current Administration continues to roll back the rights and liberties of the LGBTQ+ community, there must be a focus on how past and present policies continue to negatively impact LGBTQ+ people at the micro and macro levels.6 This Essay will also pay special attention to LGBTQ+ youth and transgender people of color",
