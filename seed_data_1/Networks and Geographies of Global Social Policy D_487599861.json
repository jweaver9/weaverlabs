It takes a comprehensive and globalized perspective onsocial policy, and the approach will help to locate and explain episodesof retrenchment, austerity, and tendencies toward de-welfarization inparticular countries, policy areas and/or social risk-groups by referenceto prior, simultaneous or anticipated episodes of expansion or contrac-tion in other countries, areas, and risks. One of the aims of this series isto address the different constellations that emerge between political andeconomic actors including international and intergovernmental organi-zations, political actors and bodies, and business enterprises. A betterunderstanding of these dynamics improves the reader’s grasp of socialpolicy making, social policy outputs, and ultimately the outcomes ofsocial policy.More information about this series athttps://link.springer.com/bookseries/16294Michael Windzio · Ivo Mossig ·Fabian Besche-Truthe · Helen SeitzerEditorsNetworksand Geographiesof Global SocialPolicy DiffusionCulture, Economy, and ColonialLegaciesEditorsMichael WindzioSOCIUMUniversity of BremenBremen, GermanyFabian Besche-TrutheSOCIUMUniversity of BremenBremen, GermanyIvo MossigInstitute of GeographyUniversity of BremenBremen, GermanyHelen SeitzerSOCIUMUniversity of BremenBremen, GermanyISSN 2661-8672 ISSN 2661-8680 (electronic)Global Dynamics of Social PolicyISBN 978-3-030-83402-9 ISBN 978-3-030-83403-6 (eBook)https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83403-6© The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2022.

Social policy diffusion is analyzedin varying fields—affecting all aspects of life—namely, old age andsurvivor pensions, labor and labor markets, health and long-term care,education and training, and family and gender policy. Based on policyfield-specific theoretical approaches, the authors of this volume investi-gate how the global diffusion of social policy occurs through differentnetwork dimensions. In this perspective, networks of global trade, colo-nial history, similarity in culture, and spatial proximity are regarded as“pipe structures,” or structural backbones, of the diffusion process. It isthe first volume that explicitly follows this macro-quantitative perspec-tive on network diffusion of different social policies on a global scale andover a long historical period, beginning in 1880. Each study applies thesame method of network-diffusion event history analysis and predictsthe diffusion process for the same set of networks in order to make theseprocesses comparable. Moreover, diffusion of each policy is highlightedby its spatial–temporal patterns in global maps. This volume thereforeprovides a comprehensive overview of the development of modern socialpolicies.viiContents1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion: TheEffects of Culture, Economy, Colonial Legacies,and Geographic Proximity 1Ivo Mossig, Michael Windzio, Fabian Besche-Truthe,and Helen Seitzer2 The Global Diffusion of Work-Injury Insurance: TheRole of Spatial Networks and Nation Building 39Nate Breznau and Felix Lanver3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion: TheIntroduction of Compulsory Education 59Helen Seitzer, Fabian Besche-Truthe,and Michael Windzio4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 83Fabian Besche-Trutheixx Contents5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 111Alexander Polte, Sebastian Haunss, Achim Schmid,Gabriela de Carvalho, and Heinz Rothgang6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems: TheNascent Diffusion of an Emergent Field of SocialPolicy 139Johanna Fischer, Alexander Polte, and Meika Sternkopf7 Origins of Family Policy: Prerequisites or Diffusion 169Tobias Böger, Keonhi Son, and Simone Tonelli8 From Geneva to the World?

Detailed, qualitative studiescan precisely highlight the mechanisms of diffusion at work, e.g.,learning, emulation, competition, or coercion (Gilardi 2016; Obingeret al. 2013). Even though this approach can reveal these mechanisms,it is limited to the respective cases under investigation. At a higherlevel of abstraction, researchers can apply statistical models for diffusionresearch on a comprehensive set of countries and over a long historical1This chapter is a product of the research conducted in the Collaborative Research Center“Global Dynamics of Social Policy” at the University of Bremen.

On the one hand, such studies usually abstract from the country-specific “micro” mechanisms; on the other hand, they provide a “macro”perspective on the diffusion process in the overall population of countriesaround the globe. The empirical studies collected in this volume followthe second approach.Our research was conducted in the Collaborative Research Center1342 (CRC 1342) at the University of Bremen, which is funded by theGerman Research Foundation (DFG). The members of the CRC 1342collected an unprecedented amount of historical data on welfare policiesaround the globe to allow for macro-quantitative analyzes of global diffu-sion in different subfields of social policy covering almost all countries inthe world. This book is a collaborative effort of the quantitative projectsin the CRC 1342 that analyze the diffusion of welfare policies.We regard diffusion as a process driven by multiplex ties betweencountries in global social networks. In social network research, multi-plexity means that subjects have network ties in various dimensions. Inour view, global trade, colonial history, similarity in culture, and spatialproximity link countries to each other. In an epidemic, nowadays anunfortunately well-known type of diffusion, the share of infected subjectsin the population depends on single events of disease-adoption at themicro-level; these events, in turn, result from some kind of interactionbetween subjects. Hence, networks are the “pipe structure,” or the struc-tural backbone, of the diffusion process. We will analyze diffusion inseveral subfields of social policy, investigating the question of whichnetwork dimensions drive the process. For instance, the introduction ofcertain labor regulations might depend more on economic ties, in partic-ular, global trade, whereas cultural similarity between countries couldM. Windzio · F.

This volume aimsat testing the different network structures against one another in theirrelevance for the diffusion process in different subfields of social policy.These policy fields are old age and survivor pensions, labor and labormarkets, health and long-term care, education and training , and family andgender policy.The present chapter introduces a network diffusion model for theanalysis of social policy diffusion. We will give a detailed overview of thenetworks used in the following contributions. By applying an identicalmethodology to different fields of social policy, studies in this volumecontribute to comparative research on the diffusion of social policy.Four different networks will be analyzed as explanatory variables inthis volume. The first is the network of geographical distance or prox-imity , which is represented by the distances between the capitals of thecountries included in the sample. This network is based on the assump-tion that diffusion processes are subject to “slowing” effects of distance(Staudacher 2005; Berry 1972). However, geographical distances do notrepresent actual network contacts but merely promote the formation,frequency, and intensity of contacts. For this reason, we will secondlyanalyze the effect of the global trade network. We assume that beneficialeconomic exchange in global markets is a crucial condition for domesticeconomic growth (Krugman et al. 2018), but global economic transac-tions might be less costly if labor or educational standards are similar.Thirdly, we will analyze the network representing “cultural spheres”(Windzio and Martens 2021), which we assume to be of particularimportance in the subfields of family and education policy. The fourthnetwork represents ties of colonial legacies between states and captureslong-term, asymmetric interdependencies. In this framework, the spatialdistance network, or more precisely the spatial proximity network, servesas a reference point for determining whether the contacts in the threeother network types exceed the breaking effect of distances and are there-fore more relevant to the diffusion of social policy (Simmons and Elkins2004).The aim of this chapter is to present in detail the methodology of thenetwork diffusion model used in the following chapters and the networksof geographical distances, global trade, cultural spheres, and colonial4 I. Mossig et al.legacies. We will give a brief overview of the current state of researchand argue that the respective networks might be relevant in explainingdiffusion processes in social policy. Subsequently, we will describe theconstruction of the networks, network parameters, and visualizations.Accounting for the change of network contacts over time, we apply longi-tudinal exponential random graph models (ERGMs) (Harris 2014) toanalyze relevant variables influencing the probability of network ties.The Network Diffusion Model in EventHistory AnalysisProcesses of social diffusion often follow a logistic growth curve. Logisticgrowth processes are common in epidemiology, where they describe thespread of infectious diseases (Shen 2020). If the mechanism of diffusionis contagion via contact among subjects, the probability of meeting an“infected” subject is very low at the beginning of an epidemic, but thelikelihood increases as the share of those who have already contracted thedisease rises.Yet subjects show considerable variance in social behavior as well asin their likelihood to contract the disease. Depending on the disease,some subjects turn out to be immune, have very few network ties, or areeven isolated. Moreover, if other subjects recover from the disease and areimmune afterward, the increase in the probability of becoming infectedat a particular moment decreases if most subjects to whom potentiallyinfected persons have contacted are now immune (left-hand side ofFig. 1.1). This applies not only to the spread of diseases (Shen 2020); wecan also describe the diffusion of innovation in this way and, accordingly,the diffusion of different social policies as well. Even though the logisticgrowth curve is a crucial characteristic of diffusion processes (Rogers2003), the underlying structure is a network. Networks were not system-atically included in diffusion analysis until the mid-1990s, when ThomasValente developed the network diffusion model (Valente 1995). At themicro-level, events of contraction drive the diffusion process, whichmeans that subjects change their state from uninfected to infected, forexample, or to have adopted an innovation—in our case, a policy. Each1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 50.05.1.15.2.25logistic density-1 -.5 0 .5 1values of x0.2.4.6.81cumulative logistic density-1 -.5 0 .5 1values of xFig. 1.1 Logistic density and cumulative logistic density functionsingle micro-level event contributes to the time-dependent aggregationof these events to the macro-level, where we then describe the diffusionprocess as a characteristic of the overall population, for example, by thecumulative logistic growth function (right-hand side of Fig. 1.1).At the starting point of an epidemic, all subjects are at risk of adoptingthe disease. Due to the waiting time until the moment of contraction,the underlying micro-level data are called episodes, with the startingpoint being the first occurrence of an infection in the population andthe endpoint being either the contraction of the disease, the end ofthe epidemic, or simply the end of the window of observation. Conse-quently, we will apply event history models to analyze micro-level eventsof policy adoption in order to reconstruct the diffusion process at thepopulation level. In these models, the dependent variable is the hazardrate (in our case the rate of adoption of the respective social policy). Itis defined as the probability P , that the event at time T , occurs withina particular interval between t and t + \u0002t , given that the event has notyet occurred at t , that is, T is greater than or equal to t .r(t) = P(t ≤ T < t + \u0002t |T ≥ t) = P(t ≤ T < t + \u0002t)P(T ≥ t)In a discrete-time situation, we can estimate event history regressionmodels by using binary outcome models (Singer and Willett 2003) suchas logit, probit, or complementary log–log models. In this volume, we6 I. Mossig et al.will use logit models, where the hazard rate r (t ) is predicted by j time-dummies α that indicate e.g., 25-year time intervals, to estimate theeffects of our four networks of trade, colonial history, cultural spheres,and spatial proximity, and some control variables β’x.r(t) = 11 + exp( −(α1t1 + ... + α j t j + β1trade + β2colony + β3culture + β4 proximty + β ′x) )Contagion at time t depends on exposure to subjects already infected att−1. Valente (1995, 43) defines exposure as the share of infected subjectsj in the (time-varying) egocentered network of subject i. The term x ijdefines a tie in the egocentered network of subject j, and aj are thosealters already infected at t . The formula below shows that exposure is afunction of t , which means that it depends on time.Ei (t) =(∑j \u0005=i xi j • a j )t(∑j \u0005=i xi j )tFigure 1.2 gives an example of how exposure is calculated and repre-sented in time-dependent episode data. The table on the right-hand sideof Fig. 1.2 represents the underlying data structure, which is comprisedof two subjects i and j. It shows the dependent variable “d” thatdenotes whether the innovation was adopted at a particular time point“t,” the network exposure (“expo.”), and one binary control variable.For this exemplary representation, we chose a dummy variable, whichindicates that subject i belongs to the WEIRD “cultural sphere” ofwestern, educated, industrialized, resourceful and democratic countries asone control variable (Henrich 2020; Seitzer et al. 2021) (see below). Wewill describe this category in more detail later on. To the left of Fig. 1.2,we see the graphical representation of network exposure in the respec-tive episodes. Observation i is exposed to 2/6 of its alters who alreadyadopted a social policy at t1, to 3/6 at t2, 4/6 at t3, and 5/6 at t4. Sincesubject i adopts the social policy at t4 + 1, when 5/6 in its network areadopters, i ’s threshold is 5/6. In contrast, subject j adopted the socialpolicy at t2 + 1 at a threshold of 3/6.1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 7Fig. 1.2 Network exposure and the hazard rateIn the column “expo.” in the table to the right of Fig. 1.2, there isa particular value of exposure for each year in which the two countriesi and j were at risk of adopting (which means that they had not yetadopted, or T ≥ t ). The event of adoption occurs as a result of a givenexposure in the moment before adoption, so the respective exposure islagged by one year. At the bottom of Fig. 1.2, hazard ratios are shownfor the binary explanatory variable WEIRD. Country i is WEIRD andhas 1 event out of 4 time periods at risk and thus a hazard rate of 0.25.Period t1 has been dropped because of the lagged exposure, i.e., thereis no data on subjects that adopted at t ≤ 1. Country j (non-WEIRD)has 1 event out of 2 time periods at risk and thus a hazard rate of 0.5,so the hazard ratio is (1/4)/(1/2) = 0.5. Computing hazard ratios andstandard errors for continuous variables, such as exposure, is much more8 I. Mossig et al.difficult and requires the application of maximum likelihood estimation,particularly if the model includes further covariates.The Methodology Used in This VolumeThroughout this volume, we use discrete-time logistic hazard models. Thedependent variable is the absorbing destination state of having adopteda social policy (= 1). Similar to Fig. 1.2, once a country has adopted thesocial policy in question, it drops out of the risk set. Since j adopts at t2+ 1, there are no data entries for the subsequent time points. Conversely,more entries are given for i because the adoption comes later in t4 + 1.Countries that adopted a policy prior to 1880 dropped out of the risk set,and if they did not adopt until 2010, they are right-censored . In hazardmodels, the consequence of left-censoring is usually that the beginningof the episode is unknown, so we cannot properly compute time-at-risk.Those countries are not considered in the risk set, i.e., in the underlyingsample on which hazard ratios are estimated. However, they contributeto the estimation of the network exposure of countries that have not yetadopted. Right-censoring, on the other hand, means that those countriesremain in the risk set throughout the entire time frame.To test whether the diffusion of social policy occurs along particularnetwork contacts, four different networks build the underlying structurethrough which we assume diffusion to occur. As mentioned before, theseare geographic proximity, trade relations, cultural similarity, and colo-nial legacies. Exposure to countries that already adopted a social policyis calculated separately for every network. Hence, while the exposureof a country i can be very high in the global trade network, it can bezero in the colonial legacies network simply because the country has nothad any colonial relationship. Furthermore, the exposure in the respec-tive network is weighted by tie strength, e.g., exposure to a countrythat had already adopted the social policy is higher in a geographicallyclose country than in one that is further away. Lastly, exposure is esti-mated either undirected (for the networks of geographic distance, globaltrade, and cultural spheres) or directed (for the network of colonial lega-cies). For the latter, this means that if the colonial power adopted a1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 9social policy, exposure for its (past) colonial entities increases. However,this does not hold the other way around. For undirected networks,exposure would take the same value regardless of direction. Generally,(unweighted) exposure is included in the logistic hazard models as anumeric variable ranging from 0, where no alter has adopted the socialpolicy, to 1, where all alters have adopted the social policy. On a similarnote, the geographical proximity network is time constant, meaning thetie strength does not change over the duration of analysis, while culturalspheres, trade, and colonial legacies are time-variant to account for thedeclining influence of colonial powers after decolonization, changingeconomic partnerships, and evolving cultural characteristics.We take the four networks as the underlying structures for the diffu-sion process. As we will see later in the chapter, all networks constitutedifferent avenues or “pipes” through which communication and infor-mation about social policies can travel. Taken together, these networksemphasize different specificities of countries’ interdependencies. Byincluding different networks, we assume to catch as many instances ofnetwork diffusion as possible through the different mechanisms.However, social policy diffusion can also depend on domestic factorssuch as a country’s level of economic development or financial capa-bility. The same is true for civil freedom in the political regime (Lindert2004). Thus, we introduce Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita(Inklaar et al. 2018) and a democratization index as baseline control vari-ables. The former was linearly interpolated for the whole time frame bytaking the minimum value for every income group based on all obser-vations before 1800 and filling in any missing values according to theminimum of the respective income group of the corresponding countryby assuming a logistic growth function. Provided there were no dataavailable, these were the values to start the interpolation into futureyears. This yields a continuous measure of economic development from1880 to 2010 for almost all countries in our dataset. For the level ofdemocratization, we use the basic Varieties of Democracy Regime Score(Lührmann et al. 2018), which in the raw data ranges from 0 to 9and was linearly interpolated for any missing data points. This methodintroduces some noise to the data, as it fills missing data points with non-natural numbers (decimals). However, filling missing data either with10 I. Mossig et al.the number observed before or thereafter would make the measurementerror even greater. We suspect the benefits of the interpolation to begreater than its disadvantages and certainly greater than having to discardobservations.Additionally, the diffusion process in question might show timedependency resulting from unobserved heterogeneity. Hence, we controlfor time dependency by using a piecewise constant step function, basedon a baseline of, e.g., 25 years steps, starting in 1880 until 2010. Never-theless, as different as the social policy fields are in this volume, authorsmight very well find a way of defining time effects that better fit theirtheories and hypotheses. One last variable that needs introduction istrade existed . This variable stems from and directly refers to the globaltrade network. Because of the historicity of the data, we are often unableto accurately describe national units that were not established in therespective historical period. This problem is especially apparent in thenetwork of global trade based upon the Correlates of War (COW) Inter-national Trade Dataset (Barbieri and Keshk 2016). Since their collectionefforts were for the purpose of measuring trade between states, any statesconsidered to be non-existent at a particular moment according to theCOW definition are not included in times of non-existence. Becauseour data covers the network across all 164 countries from 1880 until2010, empty dyads in the trade network do not necessarily mean thatno trade happened. It might just mean that the country did not existas an independent trading partner and therefore trade with this countrywas impossible. States that did exist but did not officially trade are codedwith a value of zero. To control for the possible distortion of the twodifferent meanings of zero ties, we include a dummy variable in all esti-mations which signifies whether a country, according to the trade data,existed (= 1) or did not exist (= 0).Lastly, we face a problem with statistically non-independent observa-tions. During the time frame under investigation, there are historical timeperiods in which several countries did not exist because they were part ofa larger unit. An ideal-type example of this are countries of the formerYugoslavia. For example, if Slovenia and Croatia both adopted a socialpolicy when they were part of the former Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia wasthe overarching unit that actually adopted the policy, thus resulting in1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 11the introduction of a policy when the country units Slovenia and Croatiawere non-independent observations. This is due to the way we arrangethe dataset for the diffusion analysis: the set of nodes in the networkis constant over time, which implies that Slovenia and Croatia existedbefore, during, and after Yugoslavia existed. Our approach to addressthis problem is to regard Slovenia and Croatia as “spatial patches,”remaining well aware of the fact that many countries actually changedtheir borders throughout history. From this perspective, Slovenia andCroatia were spatial patches at risk of adopting a social policy before,during, and after Yugoslavia existed. Yugoslavia will not be regarded asa subject in our sample, but Slovenia and Croatia and all other coun-tries formerly belonging to Yugoslavia are indeed distinct units. Thesesubjects are not, however, statistically independent from one another!This does not pose a problem for the calculation of exposure through thenetworks but it does cause a violation of the assumption of independenceof error terms in the maximum likelihood estimation. In the logisticdiffusion model, we address this statistical non-independence by usingcluster-robust standard errors (Zeileis et al. 2020). Our procedure hasthe following advantage: it accounts for the statistical non-independenceof observations when they are part of an overarching cluster (spatialpatch) by using the corrected standard errors, but it does not imposeany standard error correction in the hazard model for country-years notbelonging to the respective cluster or to any other cluster.The analyses in all chapters of this book follow the same rationale:First, the exposure to already “infected” countries is calculated for eachnetwork, as discussed above. This statistic, i.e., the weighted share of ego’snetwork contacts who had already adopted the policy in question at t−1,is then handed over to a time-discrete hazard model. In this model, theadoption rate is regressed on exposure, controlling for GDP per capita,the democracy index, and additional policy field-specific factors. Theresulting robust standard errors correct any statistical non-independence,potentially affecting standard errors. In most chapters, we present thecoefficients as hazard ratios, representing influence of the predictors onthe risk of policy adoption. The results therefore allow us to determinewhich of our networks represent a “pipe structure” for the contagion ofsocial policies, for example, through exposure to countries that already12 I. Mossig et al.adopted the respective policy. We can determine whether factors such ascultural similarity or trade, for example, have a stronger effect on theadoption of a policy, as they represent the better “diffusion channel.” Togive an example: if we enhance a diffusion model based on the culturalspheres network with the trade network and the effect of the formerthereby loses significance afterward, then the trade network is not just amediator of the effect of trade on diffusion but also the more appropriateexplanatory variable.Networks of Social Policy DiffusionIn the following, we discuss the networks we use to explain diffusionprocesses in different fields of social policy. As mentioned before, coun-tries are tied to each other in networks of geographical proximity, globaltrade, cultural spheres, and colonial legacies. These network dimen-sions are the basis of our comparative analysis of diffusion based on thenetwork diffusion event history model discussed in the previous section.At first sight, our four networks seem to correspond with the mech-anisms discussed in the diffusion literature (Obinger et al. 2013;Starke and Tosun 2019; Gilardi 2016). Networks of colonial legaciescould correspond with coercion, global trade networks with competition,cultural spheres networks with learning and geographical proximity withimitation. On second thought, however, such an assignment betweennetwork dimensions and diffusion mechanisms does not capture thecomplex reality of policy diffusion. For instance, global trade networkscan also indicate cooperation and division of labor, so that the mecha-nism at the dyadic or country level would be surely different. Moreover,whether a policy adoption in a particular country results from learning orimitation is hard to decide from a global, macro-quantitative perspective.It is thus important to put the power of the network diffusion approachinto perspective. Network diffusion analysis based on multiplex networkscan reveal the relative importance of the respective “pipe structure” forthe diffusion process under investigation. But neither does it provideinformation on agency and decision-making nor does it guarantee thatthe networks considered in the analysis actually are the most important1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 13structures. Possibly, other network dimensions, international organiza-tions, or even personal networks between experts and policymakers aremore important, e.g., for learning. Our approach is thus a first startingpoint in the global analysis of network diffusion of social policies.Network of Geographic DistancesThere is little doubt that geographical distance influences diffusionprocesses. The closer the objects of investigation are located to each other,the more likely they come into contact and the more likely the content ofthe diffusion process—e.g., disease, innovation, or a social policy—willbe contracted or adopted. A simple and illustrative example is the spreadof a virus transmitted via personal contacts (Cliff 1979), or, alternatively,the negative effect of geographical distance in migration (Windzio 2018)as predicted by the gravity model (Dodd 1950). The “neighborhoodeffect” is a simplified version of spatial distance, whereby a location inthe immediate neighborhood increased the risk of adoption.The strength of neighborhood effects can be derived from the diffu-sion rate, which in turn depends on the properties of the diffusing infor-mation. The adoption rate usually declines with increasing complexityof knowledge or increasing capital intensity (Staudacher 2005). Rumorsabout prominent personalities spread rather quickly, while complexscientific findings, for example, show a much slower diffusion. In addi-tion to the speed of diffusion, the spatial area in which diffusion takesplace is a crucial factor. If geographical distances were the only explana-tory factor, the speed of diffusion would allow conclusions about thetopology of the area and the distribution of subjects within this area.The diffusion rate is usually not constant across time and space, ratherthere are preferred routes—for example, through particularly intensivecontacts—which increase the propagation velocity along certain diffu-sion channels and thus have a significant influence on the propagationarea (Grabher 2006).In previous research on policy diffusion (Obinger et al. 2013),geographical distances were used as weighting matrices in spatial regres-sion models to capture dependencies in the form of “spatial lags” (e.g.,14 I. Mossig et al.Franzese and Hays 2007; Schmitt and Obinger 2013). A simple form ofa spatial weighting matrix is the neighborhood matrix. If two countrieshave a shared border, the respective cell of the neighborhood matrix hasa value of 1, and otherwise 0 (Windzio et al. 2019). The neighborhoodmatrix thus implies the assumption that only countries with a commonborder can influence each other (Obinger et al. 2013). Not least becauseof the criticism of this very narrow assumption, the distances betweencapital cities were used instead of, or rather in addition to, the neighbor-hood matrix to define “spatial lags” in the weighting matrices (Schmitt2019; Simmons and Elkins 2004).As a justification of the relevance of geographical proximity, it isoften argued that the intensity of communication between countries canincrease due to their proximity. This argument implies the assumptionthat the exchange of information between neighboring or geographi-cally close countries is substantially higher. Even unintended forms ofinformation exchange occur more easily and thus more frequently. Inaddition, policy examples from neighboring or nearby countries are oftenregarded as a blueprint for a country’s own national policies, so that ahigh degree of mutual influence is assumed due to geographical prox-imity (Schmitt and Obinger 2013). However, a clear assignment ofgeographical proximity to one of the mechanisms from the diffusionliterature—(i) learning, (ii) competition, (iii) imitation, or (iv) coercion(Obinger et al. 2013; Starke and Tosun 2019)—is difficult. Magetti andGilardi (2016) conclude that “Geography is often an important compo-nent of diffusion, but it cannot be linked straightforwardly to any ofthe […] mechanisms. Therefore, it is a catch-all indicator that usuallydiscriminates between them. It is best used in combination with otherindicators” (Magetti and Gilardi 2016, 93).Similarly, Simmons and Elkins (2004) note that geographical distancedoes not provide a satisfactory explanation for policy diffusion per se.In line with their view, Beck et al. (2006) point out in a contribu-tion with the significant title “Space is more than Geography” that,on the one hand, taking geographical distances into account in spatialeconometrics is a methodological enrichment, but that other measuresfor determining interconnectedness between states would produce morefruitful results. Similarly, Boschma (2005) argues that proximity not1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 15only encompasses physical–geographical proximity, but that cognitive,organizational, social, and institutional forms of proximity exist as well.Accordingly, neighboring countries are more likely to display similarsocial structures and traditions. These similarities serve as one expla-nation for the high correlation between culture and spatial proximity.This argument fits well with our idea that cultural proximity can also bean important dimension. Ties in the network of “cultural spheres” (seebelow), which is correlated with spatial proximity, can be a much moremeaningful condition of diffusion. Whereas spatial proximity betweencapitals is measured almost accurately, however, the network of culturalspheres is a combination of various complex characteristics and there-fore more prone to measurement error. According to this brief overview,we argue that the network of geographical distances serves as a referencepoint to measure the relevance of the contact networks of global trade,cultural spheres, and colonial connections.The calculation of distances between capitals is described in detail inEiser et al. (2020). The corresponding dataset is available in the GlobalWelfare State Information System WeSIS (www.wesis.org). To ensurethat an increasing geographical distance indicates a decrease in the inten-sity of contact, we calculated the inverse of distance. The value for thecontact between two countries i and j due to geographical proximity istherefore:xi j = 1/ capital distanceEven though there are occasional shifts of the capital in some countries,for pragmatic reasons the distances are based on the capital cities in 2020.Therefore, the geographical distances are a time-invariant network.Global Trade NetworksIn international comparative social policy research, trade networks area central indicator for mapping economic globalization processes. Bothin the first wave of globalization from 1890 to World War I (WWI),and especially during the second wave of globalization from World WarII (WWII) to the mid-1980s, the density of trade networks increased16 I. Mossig et al.rapidly, and trade was the central engine of economic globalization(Mossig and Lischka 2022). In social policy research, the share of trade([imports + exports]/GDP) was traditionally interpreted as an indicatorof economic openness (Busemeyer 2009). Cameron (1978) was one ofthe first to show an empirical association between the expansion of thepublic sector and the integration into world trade for 18 Western indus-trialized countries. According to his argument, open economies with ahigh share of trade in GDP are particularly dependent on external events,such as price developments on the world market. In order to counteractthese external dependencies, these open economies try to extend theirinfluence within the domestic economic sectors. Smaller economies inparticular have comparatively high trade shares as a percentage of GDPdue to the smaller domestic market and a high degree of specializationin their own industrial structure. Accordingly, the economic openness ofsmaller economies, such as the Scandinavian countries or the Nether-lands, partially explains the disproportionate expansion of the welfarestate. In the literature, such side effects of economic globalization arediscussed in the context of the compensation thesis (Rieger and Leibfried2003; Starke and Tosun 2019).Since the 1980s the importance of trade networks on world marketintegration declined. States have now become increasingly involved inglobal competition for foreign direct investment (FDI). This competi-tion takes place with regard to the range of low-cost location conditionsoffered, for example, in terms of social security contributions or taxes(Mossig and Lischka 2022; Düpont et al. 2022). In order to survive thiscompetition, policymakers considered a dismantling of the welfare stateby lowering social standards and social contributions as necessary (Swank2010), which was referred to as a “race to the bottom” (Kvist 2004) inthe literature.Openness or inclusion as measured by trade shares in a country’sGDP or foreign direct investments (FDI stocks or flows) is a highlyaggregated indicator. It disregards the varying importance of differenttrading partners, i.e., it does not differentiate between trading partnersthat are important and unimportant to ego. In addition, indirect connec-tions via third trading partners are neglected. However, the structure ofthe network and the position of the individual states in this network1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 17largely determine the scope of action and also influence the vulnerabilityand sensitivity of interstate relations (Glückler and Doreian 2016; Maoz2011). The significance of economic globalization and the relevance ofintensifying trade linkages for the diffusion of social policy is based onthe assumption that important trading partners influence a country’spolicies more strongly than subordinate trading partners do. As a resultof the globalization process, countries are becoming more closely alignedwith one another, although this does not necessarily mean that socialpolicy has to converge (Jahn 2016).The trade networks were defined as follows: The trade data arecollected from the Correlates of War Project (Barbieri and Keshk 2016).According to the following regulations, the edge weights were deter-mined for each year. The volume of trade between each of the twocountries comprises the total trade in goods in one year and is there-fore undirected. The original trade flows were converted into US$ usingthe average exchange rate from 2011 to avoid an inflation-related densifi-cation of the networks. Due to the extremely different trade volumes, welogarithmically transformed the trade values. The edge weight of tradeinterdependence between two countries i, j is therefore:xi j ={log(trade) if trade> 00 if trade= 0If a dyad shared any trade volume in any respective year, the log of thisvolume was used, otherwise the edge was set to 0 as the dyad did notshare any trade in the respective year. Further decisions regarding theconstruction of trading networks concern former countries that havesplit up over time, e.g., Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia, or Serbia-Montenegro. In such countries, the trade volume of the shared years wasdivided according to the GDP proportion of these countries after thesecountries separated from each other. In the case of the Union of SovietSocialist Republics (USSR) this refers to the period from 1922 to 1991,in the case of the Baltic States 1941–1991, and in the case of the formerYugoslavia the period from 1918 to 1992. “Small” states that once existedbut are not represented in the selected country sample for this anthologywere deleted (e.g., Yemen People’s Republic, Republic of Vietnam, Korea18 I. Mossig et al.from 1880 to 1905, Kosovo, Zanzibar). Furthermore, because there aresome missing values, we include a dummy variable in the later analysiswhich depicts whether a country “existed” based on the COW defini-tion, as explained in detail above. The network representation in Fig. 1.3is a quadrilateral Simmelian backbone (Nocaj et al. 2015) (Fig. 1.3).The network visualization only shows to a limited extent how inten-sively individual countries are involved in global trade. But weighteddegree centrality can be used as a measure of network integration. In2010, China was the country with the highest trade integration (degreecentrality of 1.92). The value 1.92 indicates that China was involvedin 1.92% of bilateral trade worldwide, followed by the USA (1.80),Fig. 1.3 The network of global trade in 20101 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 19Table 1.1 Countries in quartiles of degree centrality1st Quartile(Degree: 1.92–1.27)17 Countries:CHN, USA, DEU, FRA, ITA, NLD, JPN, IND, GBR, KOR,BEL, ESP, BRA, TUR, RUS, CAN, THA2nd Quartile(Degree: 1.21–0.87)24 Countries:MYS, CHE, SWE, IDN, ZAF, SGP, AUS, AUT, ARE, POL,SAU, UKR, DNK, FIN, ARG, CZE, EGY, PRT, NOR, GRC,IRL, MEX, PAK, ROU3rd Quartile(Degree: 0.86–0.52)38 Countries:HUN, VNM, MAR, ISR, NZL, IRN, CHL, NGA, BGR, DZA,COL, SVK, SVN, PHL, BLR, LBN, BGD, QAT, TUN, KAZ,PER, KWT, HRV, VEN, LTU, SYR, OMN, KEN, CIV, ECU,LKA, JOR, GHA, URY, LBY, LVA, LUX, CRI4th Quartile(Degree: 0.51–0.05)81 Countries:IRQ, AZE, EST, CYP, GTM, DOM, YEM, TZA, CMR, SEN,AGO, TTO, SDN, PAN, GEO, PRY, CUB, MUS, MKD,HND, UGA, UZB, MOZ, SLV, ZMB, BEN, ETH, TKM,COG, MDA, ARM, ALB, AFG, GAB, KHM, BIH, ZWE,JAM, GIN, BOL, COD, TGO, MRT, PRK, NIC, LBR, MMR,MDG, TJK, NAM, BFA, MWI, MLI, GNQ, HTI, KGZ,PNG, DJI, MNE, SWZ, NER, MNG, GUY, SLE, NPL, RWA,GMB, TCD, LAO, SUR, BWA, FJI, SOM, BDI, CAF, GNB,SLB, COM, LSO, BTNNo 2010 trade data reported for CPV, SRB, SSD, and TLSGermany (1.69), and France (1.57). The following Table 1.1 divides thecountry sample into quartiles. 17 countries (10.4% out of 164 countries)with the highest centrality rating account for 25% of the cumulativedegree centrality. In contrast, the last quartile is occupied by 81 countrieswith the lowest centrality values in global trade. Bhutan, for example,which ranks last, only accounts for 0.05% of global trade. Lesotho(0.08), the Comoros (0.09), and the Solomon Islands (0.10) also hada very low-degree centrality in 2010.The Network of “Cultural Spheres”During the last decades, culture became an increasingly importantconcept in economics and the social sciences (Rose 2019; Emirbayerand Goodwin 1994). Despite its importance, however, culture is quitea controversial concept. Culture exists at different levels (Basáñez 2016);20 I. Mossig et al.it can be very local, or it can encompass wider regions of the world—the term can be used to refer to the character of business organizationsor of neighborhoods, cities, and nation-states (Anderson-Levitt 2007).Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” emphasized the role of culturalconflicts after the end of the Cold War but attracted sharp criticismfor his approach because it also challenged optimistic views on culturaldiversity. He derived his typology of world cultures from the mostimportant world religions but did not appropriately account for thecultural diversity within these religions and regions. Finally, he focusedon “fault lines” between cultures, where he supposed conflicts to bemost likely to occur (Huntington 1993). Given this criticism, scien-tific investigations should think more carefully about how to classifycultures rather than simply abstaining from analyzing this importantdriving force of global politics and political and social change of nation-states. We thus use the concept of “cultural spheres,” which distinguishescultures in the world but allows fuzzy boundaries, a considerable degreeof overlap, and change in cluster membership over time (Windzio andMartens 2021). Our typology of cultural spheres results from a combi-nation of time-varying indicators. By regarding cultures as spheres withfuzzy boundaries, changing membership, and considerable overlap, weavoid an essentialist concept of culture. We coded our cultural indi-cators as binary variables and created a valued two-mode network inwhich countries are linked to one another by sharing one or severalcultural characteristics, e.g., the highest quartile of the index of polit-ical liberties or the same language group. We used the following culturalcharacteristics to build the two-mode network of cultural spheres: acountry’s dominant religion, gender relations, civil liberties, rule of law,government ideology (nationalist, socialist or communist, restorative orconservative, separatist or autonomist, religious), dominant languagegroup, hegemonic language (English, Spanish, Arabic), Huntington’scivilizations (African, Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Latin American, LoneStates, Orthodox, Sinic, Western), and both long and short-term colonialinfluence (Besche-Truthe et al. 2020). The more of these characteristicstwo countries share, the higher their cultural proximity. In our networkdiffusion models, we thus include exposure as a weighted term, whichmeans that exposure increases with the growing share of adopters in1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 21the network but also with the increasing tie-strength to these adopters.The cultural spheres network is time varying. For example, proportionsof dominant religious or ethnic groups as well as dominant languagechanged over time.To gain a better overview of the network and the resulting culturalspheres, we clustered the network with a Louvain clustering algorithm.According to the time-variant nature of the network, the result suggestsa five-cluster solution in 1880 but a three-cluster solution in 2010. Thissupports the idea that there has been an increasing isomorphism in insti-tutional structures around the globe (Meyer et al. 1997). Figure 1.4Fig. 1.4 Network of cultural spheres in 201022 I. Mossig et al.shows the result of a Louvain clustering procedure which results in athree-cluster solution for the year 2010. Blue vertices represent a clusterof mostly WEIRD (see above) and economically developed countries,the second cluster (green) mainly consists of non-dominantly MuslimAfrican, Asian, and South American countries, and the third cluster(orange) is dominated by Muslim countries. A closer inspection ofthese clusters shows that there is some overlap between cultural spheresand world regions, but this correspondence is far from being perfect(Fig. 1.4).Network of Colonial LegaciesResearching the history of social policy adoption means to acknowl-edge specific historical interdependencies. A thorough and encompassingdiffusion study must consider early social policy diffusion “under theconditions of colonialism” and “under conditions of continuing post-colonial ties” (Kuhlmann et al. 2020, 81). Influences of these depen-dencies can be as diverse as the mechanisms of diffusion. On theone hand, we can assume a coercive mechanism in that the empirejust implemented policies in colonies without deliberation. The processof social policies diffusing from the empire to dependent entities isdescribed as “imperial diffusion” (Kuhlmann et al. 2020). After the colo-nial dominion ended, however, a different diffusion mechanism mighthave been at work. For example, we know from diffusion research thatperceived similarity can foster orientation toward some specific “rolemodel” countries; Australia might look to Britain and Guinea to Francefor appropriate policy solutions (Dobbin et al. 2007, 453). Further-more, possible policy solutions can be easier to implement because ofpath dependencies, such as institutional structures implemented duringcolonial rule that were modeled according to the role model. However,adverse effects can also be existent, as the institutionalization of policiesin colonies differed in light of different characteristics and the strengthof indigenous traditions (Craig 1981, 192).Moreover, after colonization ends, the forged linkages between nation-states can facilitate diffusion in several ways. Specialized actors enter into1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 23transnational contact, especially in cases where nation-states are activelysearching for role models for their institutions or for the transforma-tion of their welfare systems. Once, a colonial link has been forged, theinfluence does not recede immediately after independence. Indeed, paststudies show a strong correlation between colonial past on the one handand enhanced contact and influence between the two countries on theother, such as through migration (Windzio 2018) or development aid(Shields and Menashy 2017), for example.To include both colonial dependencies and postcolonial influences, weestablished a network of colonial legacies which is time-variant, directed,and weighted. This means that much like social network surveys, colo-nized countries “nominate” their colonizers. In the years of colonialdominion, the weight of the tie is 1. After colonization ended, an expo-nential decay parameter is estimated, representing the eroding influenceof the former colonial link. The exponential function has been chosenbecause the values tend to get quite small, i.e., the influence via a linkof colonial legacy is diminishing. For example, the values of ties are 0.97one year after colonization, 0.77 ten years after colonization, and 0.08one hundred years after colonization. The decay parameter was calculatedwith the following function:exp(−(No. years since colony ends/40))In our view, the influence of a colonial power does not simply disappearimmediately after the colony becomes officially independent. Accordingto our assumption, the influence of the colonial power declines muchmore gradually over time after official independence is achieved. Thereare different variants to compute exposure due to the colonial legacybased on this function. We apply the function to the standardized expo-sure as computed by the netdiffuseR package (Vega Yon and Valente2021), which restricts the range of exposure between zero and one.Accordingly, the theoretical assumption is that colonial legacy is verystrong and the strength of the colonial power’s influence remains almostconstant after independence. In contrast, if we do not standardizethe exposure, the influence of former colonial powers still exist, butcompared to the standardized computation of exposure, the power24 I. Mossig et al.declines after colonization. To date, there is no commonly accepted stan-dard by which the influence of former colonial ties on the subsequenthistory of a country can be modeled. There are even more alternativeapproaches that are conceivable, e.g., that the network of colonial tiesis simply cross-sectional, but this would be a strange assumption for thehistorical periods before colonization. Another approach would be to testthe influence in a time-constant way after colonization ended, whereasthe tie in the colonization network is zero before colonization. The“right” way to capture the effect of colonial legacies might also dependon the particular social policy under investigation. Finally, since we areinterested in comparing the effects of different networks on the diffusionof social policy, we should keep in mind the strong correlation of expo-sure across different networks. Hence, researchers should also interprettheir results against the background of considerable multicollinearity.The raw data is based on the Colonial Dates Dataset (COLDAT) byBastian Becker (2019) in combination with the Centre d’Etudes Prospec-tives et d’Informations Internationales (CEPII) (Head and Mayer 2014)and our own data collection using Wikipedia. In line with CEPII, ourdefinition of colonial links is that a colonial relationship should involvelong-term, civilian administration that includes significant settlement.We assume, for instance, that the territory of what is now known asArmenia was “colonized” by the Persian Empire before 1828 and bythe Ottoman Empire before 1920, as well as simultaneously by Russiabetween 1813 and 1918. After that time, we assume Armenia to be a“colony” of Russia until the dissolution of the USSR in 1990. Althoughthese relations do not depict “classic” (exploitative) colonial relations, wefind merit in a more encompassing approach. The long rule of an empireleaves marks on the society and the political system at large. We stillsee some former USSR states that actively search for contact to Russiaand openly base their (authoritarian) policies on Russian examples, e.g.,Belarus. Furthermore, by using the aforementioned decay parameter wedo assume a decreasing influence of former rule by empires. Nevertheless,the colonial network poses a methodological problem when, for instance,a social policy was adopted for the entirety of the USSR. Due to thesimultaneous adoption of policy, the exposure of former USSR states iscalculated as 0 at the time of policy adoption. That, however, would1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 25Fig.1.5Thenetworkofcoloniallegacies26 I. Mossig et al.assume an incorrect threshold and therefore distort the regression esti-mation. Hence, in contrast to Fig. 1.2, exposure was calculated withouta one-year lag in the colonial network, i.e., exposure at t is calculated asthe ratio of alters that adopted precisely at t and not t−1 (Fig. 1.5).Correlations of Our NetworksSocial networks are the structural backbone of the diffusion process. Weare interested in whether the multiplex network in the dimensions ofgeographic proximity, colonial heritage, global trade, and cultural prox-imity do actually relate to different influence channels, or whether theytend to be rather redundant. If the correlation between ties in a networkor, more precisely, the value of different edges in the dyads are stronglycorrelated, these networks tend to be redundant. As Table 1.2 indi-cates, this is definitely not the case. Here we see a correlation matrixof the weighted edges and find only minor correlations overall. We findthe highest correlation between networks of cultural spheres and (log)trade (r = 0.242). As a result, these four networks are far from beingredundant.However, the correlation of these networks is not the same as thecorrelation of exposure to alters that have already adopted the informa-tion. At the beginning of a pandemic, for example, when exposure isgenerally low, it does not matter whether these networks are correlatedor not. Exposure will be low anyway. Minor differences in network struc-ture can correspond to strong differences in exposure if, for example, theego-network of country i has just one more tie to an adopter in theTable 1.2 Correlations of (weighted) networksGeogr.proximityColonial ties(exp. decay) Log (trade)CulturalproxGeogr. proximity 1.000 – – –Colonial tie(exp. decay)0.007 1.000 – –Log(trade) 0.036 −0.007 1.000 –Cultural prox 0.071 −0.019 0.242 1.0001 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 27Table 1.3 Correlations of (weighted) exposure to alters that adopted compul-sory educationCulturalproxColonial ties(exp. decay) Log (trade)Geogr.proximityCultural prox 1.000 – – –Colonial ties(exp. decay)0.142 1.000 – –Log(trade) 0.728 0.038 1.000 –Geogr. proximity 0.919 0.050 0.741 1.000(weighted) trade network than in the cultural spheres network but theadditional tie in the trade network has a particularly high weight in thecomputation of exposure. Similarly important are situations when mostalters are already infected and exposure is generally high. Exposure can be1 (maximum normalized exposure) in a network dimension where ego istied to 12 alters, but it can also be 1 in another network dimension whereego is tied only to 2 alters. Table 1.3 shows the correlations of (weighted)exposure to alters that adopted compulsory education. Indeed, corre-lations are considerably higher. Exposure in the network of geographicproximity is strongly correlated with the network of cultural proximity(0.919) and also with exposure in the trade network (0.741). Moreover,trade and cultural proximity are highly correlated as well (0.728).Structural Features and Interdependenciesof Our NetworksHow can we further characterize these networks? Networks of positiveties often show transitive hierarchies, as epitomized by the adage “friendsof my friends are my friends.” If node i names node j as a friend, and ifj is befriended with node k, i tends to close the triad and establish a tieto k because i regards friends of j as his or her friends as well. However,not all networks show this pattern. A visual inspection of the colonialties network in Fig. 1.5 suggests that the overall share of transitive triadsof all triads is comparatively low, but the structure is dominated by so-called “in-stars.” We use Exponential Random Graph Models ERGMs28 I. Mossig et al.(Harris 2014) in order to explain the basic determinants of the respec-tive networks in a multivariate regression. We recoded the weighted edgesinto binary values by setting the lowest quintile of geographic distanceto 1 (else = 0). We did the same with values of ≥ 3 of log(trade )and values > 3 of weighted cultural proximity. These thresholds iden-tify rather strong ties in the respective network. The motivation of thismodel is to maximize the likelihood of actually observing the empiricalnetwork x out of the huge set of networks X that the respective set ofnodes (in our case countries) could form. The outcome of interest is theprobability P of observing the empirical network x out of the huge setX. The odds of all possible networks are represented by κ(θ), and due toκ(θ), P is indeed a probability in the equation below, expressed in a waythat resembles a multinomial logit model.P(X = x) = exp{θ′z(x)}κ(θ), where κ(θ) =2g(g−1)∑n=1exp{θ ′z(x)}The likelihood is maximized by inserting coefficients θ for the networkcharacteristics z(x), e.g., transitive closure, homophily, or any other kindof explanatory variable. Because of the statistical non-independence innetworks, it is almost impossible to get reliable results by using maximumlikelihood methods, the estimation is based on Markov Chain MonteCarlo (MCMC) simulations. Given the specified regression equation, thealgorithm generates a huge set of networks by inserting θ coefficientsdrawn from a random distribution and adapts these coefficients untilthe equation generates networks similar to the empirical network withrespect to the underlying characteristics z(x). The resulting coefficients θof a converged model can be interpreted as changes in the log odds of atie in the respective network due to a one-unit change in the explanatoryvariable z(x).The first column in Table 1.4 shows determinants of ties in the tradenetwork, the second column in the network of cultural spheres , andthe third column in the network of colonial histories.

The term “edges” is the intercept of the regression modeland represents the log odds of the network density, given that all covari-ates are constrained to zero. The positive significant effect of gwesp(geometrically edgewise shared partners) indicates that transitive closuremuch more likely occurs in the empirical network than in a corre-sponding random network. In contrast, gwdsp (geometrically dyadwiseshared partners) shows a significantly negative effect and points to thelower probability of open triads (Harris 2014). Aside from these networkstructural effects, ties in the trade network depend on spatial proximity(0.1488*) and cultural spheres (0.9971*) but not significantly on colo-nial legacies. They occur less often if two countries have the same levelof democratization (same regime) and the higher the absolute difference30 I. Mossig et al.in GDP per capita between ego and alter is. Unsurprisingly, global tradeis an issue of economically well-performing countries since high levelsof GDP increase the degree (0.0332*). We also estimated the memory-term of “tie stability” (Leifeld et al. 2016), which indicates the stabilityof ties and non-ties, and thereby accounts for how strongly the state ofthe network at t depends on its previous state at t−1 (Table 1.4).Column 2 in Table 1.4 shows the effects on the log odds of tiesin the network of cultural spheres . Again, we find the pattern of hightransitivity (gwesp) and a negative tendency toward open triads (gwdsp).Having a tie in the network of colonial legacies has a negative effecton cultural similarity (−0.3214*), which means that countries colonizedother countries that were culturally rather different. Contrariwise, a tie inthe network of global trade increases the log odds of a tie in the culturalspheres network—which we also do not interpret in a strict causal sensebecause the direction of the influence could also be reversed (0.8275*).Our model does not indicate that political regime type in terms oflevels of democratization and economic development corresponds withculture: if two countries have the same level of democratization, thelog odds of a tie in the cultural spheres network is only insignificantlyincreased. The absolute difference in GDP is insignificant as well. Again,the memory-term indicates a significant effect of the lagged network.Finally, we analyze the network of colonial legacies, which has quitea specific topology as shown in Fig. 1.5. This network is rather specialsince there are few “hubs” with many ingoing ties, and there is a cleardistinction between node sets of senders and receivers. We find a positiveeffect of 2-in-stars. This means that two ingoing ties occur significantlymore often than expected by chance, which is obvious from the visualrepresentation in Fig. 1.6. In addition, there are positive effects of spatialproximity and ties in the trade network. While there is no effect of sameregime, effects of GPD per capita are negative on outdegree. Accordingly,richer countries name other countries as colonizers less often: overall,richer counties have a considerably lower risk of being colonized.1 Networks of Global Social Policy Diffusion … 31Overview of the VolumeSocial policy fields investigated in this volume are old age and survivorpensions, labor and labor markets, health and long-term care, educa-tion and training, and family and gender policy. In Chapter 2, Breznauand Lanver analyze the introduction of work injury insurance, whichoften marks the beginning of an emerging welfare state. According tothe results, spatial proximity and levels of democratization are the majordeterminants of adoption, but ties in the trade network also have apositive effect. Emerging education states are analyzed by Seitzer, Besche-Truthe, and Windzio in Chapter 3. They show that cultural proximityhas a strong effect on the adoption of compulsory education, but thiseffect vanishes after controlling for spatial proximity. Similarly, in Besche-Truthe’s study (Chapter 4) the effect of a tie in the network of culturalproximity becomes insignificant upon the adoption of adult basic educa-tion policies after controlling for spatial proximity, GDP per capita, andlevel of democratization. Moreover, although the introduction of health-care systems, as analyzed in Chapter 5 by Polte, Haunss, Schmid , DeCarvalho, and Rothgang , mainly occurred in economically prosperouscountries before WWII, the effect of GDP decreases in subsequentperiods. In addition, the effect of spatial proximity decreases over time,whereas the effect of trade networks seems to increase. Another impor-tant policy in aging societies is long-term care, analyzed by Fischer, Polte,and Sternkopf in Chapter 6. Aside from geographic proximity, thereseems to be no horizontal diffusion via networks. Rather, the introduc-tion of long-term care systems depends on problem pressure (population75+), political empowerment of women, GDP per capita, and levels ofdemocratization.In their study on the introduction of paid maternity leave, familyallowances, and the adoption of workplace childcare regulations, Böger,Son, and Tonelli (Chapter 7) show that while paid maternity leave wasan important issue on the agenda of the International Labour Organiza-tion (ILO), family allowances tend to depend more on domestic factors.In contrast, there seem to be effects of colonial legacies, particularly32 I. Mossig et al.in former French colonies, with regard to workplace childcare regula-tions. The ILO is in the focus of Hahs study on the ratification of theC111 Anti-Discrimination Legislation in Employment and Occupation(Chapter 8). Ties in the network of colonial legacies and spatial prox-imity seem to drive the diffusion process, but the former effect is stronglyconfounded with a country’s legal origin.Interestingly, exposure to other countries due to similarity in culturehas a negative effect on the adoption of antidiscrimination legislationsupporting the LGBTQ+ community, whereas there are positive expo-sure effects in the network of global trade (see the study of Seitzer inChapter 9).Chapter 10 by Schmitt and Obinger critically reviews the results andthe research design applied in this volume. They appreciate the macro-quantitative approach to social policy diffusion, but also recognize itslimitations. Analyzing network diffusion highlights the global interde-pendence, but does not tell us much about the precise mechanism atwork in a respective country dyad or subnetwork. These mechanisms alsodepend on country-specific factors and sometimes on idiosyncratic situ-ations that we cannot generalize to other interdependent constellations.Future research on policy diffusion should thus systematically considermixed-methods designs and apply a combination of macro-quantitativedata and in-depth case study analyzes.LiteratureAnderson-Levitt, Kathryn M. 2007. “A World Culture of Schooling?

They extended the basicprinciples of responsibility for damages done to persons or property1This chapter is a product of the research conducted in the Collaborative Research Center“Global Dynamics of Social Policy” at the University of Bremen.

Lanverfound in civil and common law traditions. Their implementation coin-cided with new, dangerous forms of employment in factories, mech-anized extraction, and construction that came with industrialization.The workers, families, and communities affected by these new industrialrisks demanded protection, putting pressure on policymakers (Wilensky1975; Kangas 2010).Usually, the first work-injury law introduced in a state was employerliability . Although these laws often standardized compensation levels andexplicitly covered work-related damages, they did little to reduce workersubversions and revolts. They mostly did not insure against risk becausethe burden of proof of harm fell on the worker and compensations weresmall and limited in duration (Flora and Alber 2009). More advancedand effective laws involved the creation of social insurance. These placedall employees into an insurance scheme, with automatic entitlementsto compensation unless otherwise proven by the employer or insur-ance agency in court. Social insurance offered financial predictability,less workplace violence, and protection of both employers and employeesfrom legal battles (Tripp 1976; Berkowitz and Berkowitz 1984; Pavalko1989).Employer liability laws tended to pave the way for social insurancelaws. However, history suggests no standardized trajectory (Haggard andKaufman 2008). Types of work-injury laws are only weakly correlatedwith industrialization and democratization, leaving functional theorieslimited in their capacity to explain cross-country patterns of welfarestate development (Alber 1982). For example, Britain was the earliestindustrializing society and quite democratic, but a latecomer to socialinsurance in 1934. Germany was less industrialized and less demo-cratic, but a pioneer in 1884. Meanwhile, France was similarly developedas Germany and slightly more democratic, but only introduced socialinsurance 10 years later in 1894 (Breznau and Lanver 2020).Factors of political economy are likely responsible for such variation.Work-injury social insurance, and the general implementation of socialinsurance across policy domains, is an important strategy in political rule.Social protection laws shift the burden of individual risk to the collectivelevel, meaning that workers and rulers become bound together with acommon welfare interest. The extent of these provisions often depends2 The Global Diffusion of Work-Injury Insurance … 41on the success of left/labor parties and special interests. In general, thisstrategy is an adaptation of military conscription. Dating back to theGreeks and Romans, ruling powers used the promise of veteran bene-fits to motivate and compensate soldiers engaged in potentially deadlywork to defend the territory and its people (Ierley 1984). Soldier provi-sions often included forms of health care, pensions, survivor benefits,and compensation for injuries obtained on duty. The utility of welfareprovisions for expanding and defending a nation’s borders simultaneouslyaided in developing and expanding allegiance of soldiers to that nation.This process can be transferred to workers and their support of their orga-nizations, political parties, and the national government (Obinger et al.2018).Theoretical Framework: Nation-StateInstitution and CodificationThe idea of a nation-state and democratic rule of law was quite new inthe late 1800s when states first started making national work-injury poli-cies. It was precisely the expansion of rights by a state that led to workershaving new forms of power to exert in the state (voting, the right toorganize). At the same time, the architects and policymakers developingnation-states were able to build their own bases of power by offeringthese rights (Marshall 1950), and with these rights came institutionaldevelopments like social insurance and the stable bureaucratic structuresto implement it that strengthened the worker-state relationship. Theallegiance of workers in all their forms was crucial to nation-buildingbecause they represented the largest segments of society demographi-cally and were increasingly exposed to resistance tactics that threatenedthe state through urban concentration and the spread of Communistdoctrine.Theories of power resources and institutions argue that politics andthe ability of special interests to organize and exert power influencedthe timing and scope of work-injury laws. As argued by Korpi (1983),the agents of the working class—especially unions, socialist movements,and “left”-parties—competed with employer organizations and special42 N. Breznau and F. Lanverinterest groups for influence in development of social, economic, andpolitical institutions via the state. The mobilization of the working class,motivated in particular by the spread of new socialist ideas, imposedpressure on the old and new power elites, forcing them to take strategicaction. It is thus a combination of power resources and ruling strategieswhich fostered the stabilizing role of social insurance in nation state-building. The Communist movements were just one example of thethreat of revolution that lurked among populations in early Europeanstate-building after the French Revolution (Breznau 2020).In Bismarckian Germany, for example, the introduction of socialinsurance went hand-in-hand with the Sozialistengesetze , which werevarious laws prohibiting a range of socialist, social-democratic, andcommunist associations. These laws were dismantled in 1890 due tothe continued success of the socialist party and its allies; however, bythis point Germany had introduced the world’s first national, and rela-tively comprehensive work-injury social insurance scheme. Arguably, thiscontributed to the failure of a socialist revolution despite strong socialistorganization, because the state became strong through public legitimacy,not only the use of force. In a similar vein, Béland and Koreh (2019)suggest that in both Canada and Israel social insurance policies playeda prominent role in state-building, despite extremely different historicaland institutional trajectories. Just as with taxes, the authors stress theimportance of revenue raising in contributory schemes, emphasizing thepossibility to use those programs to expand state fiscal capacities andlegitimacy. As states legislate in more areas and control or regulate moreforms of insurance, the state itself becomes indispensable to the economyand social welfare.Whether giving or regulating or simply reacting to worker revolts,state-building was certainly not a linear, “friendly” process, but oneof contradictions and conflict. Nation-building entails attempts to vestthe highest level of power and authority into nation-state governance,a power to which all other power resource groups (parties, unions,employer organizations, etc.) are subjugated. From a Gramscian perspec-tive, this would be construction of a hegemonic state through bothcoercion (strong laws against revolutionary organizations) and consent(providing citizenship, new rights, and social insurance).2 The Global Diffusion of Work-Injury Insurance … 43State leaders and policymakers did not operate in isolation. Theyconstantly engaged in policy learning from other states as they competednot only for strengthening local, regional, and global power and stability.This was facilitated by international organizations, political treaties, andtrade. Liu and Leisering (2017) argue that the adoption of Bismarckiansystems was the product of international norm-setting by the Interna-tional Labor Organization (ILO). For example, Japan directly importedGerman civil law and later Bismarckian social insurance principles in its(strong) state development, and the latter was specifically intended tohead off labor problems witnessed across Europe (Gordon 1985). TheCommunist party was certainly an international organization by the late1800s and had great influence on worker movements even before theILO and in countries across the globe from the USA to Japan.It is therefore our main contention that work-injury and especiallysocial insurance were particularly important in the process of nation-building. Given that work-injury protection in the form of social insur-ance tended to preclude or coincide with other forms of social security(pensions and unemployment protection, for example), it should be akey event in the construction of successful nations. As it requires legiti-macy and a clear nation-state within which to enact the policy, it shouldcome in the early stages of nation-state development. Therefore, wehypothesize that social insurance is more likely in the years immediatelyafter nation state formation.At the same time, employer liability policies were often enacted toplacate rather than empower workers. They paid lip service to workermovements and calls from elites or humanistic organizations to helpthe lot of the suffering workers. In many cases they were simply lawsto achieve recognition and clout internationally, as with appearing ‘inline’ with the powerful ILO; workmen’s compensation being among theearliest conventions (C012 1921 and C017 1925). Given that employerliability laws did not specifically link workers with the state in a soli-daristic way because they left the burden of proof (thus risk) on theworkers, we expect that enactment of employer liability laws is not morelikely in the years immediately after nation state formation.44 N. Breznau and F. LanverWe incorporate our unique hypotheses within the larger theoreticalperspective motivating the collective research in this book. Namely, weare also investigating the development of social policy as a process ofglobalization, so we test our hypotheses while simultaneously attemptingto account for diffusion and historical trajectories. Diffusion processesrelated to colonialism, trade, migration, and culture are often theorizedand tested in the development of social spending or the introductionof welfare state laws (Collier and Messick 1975; Schmitt 2015; Eggeret al. 2017); but we are aware of no study that simultaneously accountsfor both density of adoption among network ties and event historytrajectories to estimate the likelihood of adopting work-injury insurance.Data andMethodsAll data and replication materials are available in our Project Repository.2We use the Global Work-Injury Policy Dataset (GWIP v1.0) (Breznauand Lanver 2020) to measure the year of introduction for our depen-dent variables first law and first social insurance . We recode the latterto the year when all formal blue-collar workers were de jure covered.Some countries introduced a first social insurance law that covered onlycertain segments and we do not count this. To be consistent with ournation-building theory, the law should apply to the industrial, blue-collarworkforce whose allegiance is arguably necessary for national success,and certainly strong development in a global capitalist economy. Fullinformation on all covariates is available for 151 countries from 1880 to2010.Our primary test variable is the year that a country became an inde-pendent state and the four years following. We also include the yearprior to state formation to account for any measurement error associ-ated with chopping time data into yearly points; although in only twocases, a law appeared the year before state formation. We would arguethis is not coincidental but a part of the state formation which starts2 https://github.com/nbreznau/work_inj_diff.2 The Global Diffusion of Work-Injury Insurance … 45many months or years prior to a formal declaration of independence. Toidentify state formation, we take the institution of a state governmentthat had autonomous or semi-autonomous (usually under the purviewof a monarch) domain over policymaking most often established via aconstitution and covering consistent borders or people as our criteria.For example, Germany in 1871 and Japan in 1890.Our other independent variables in the analysis account for modern-ization and political regime by measuring Gross Domestic Product(GDP) per capita in ten thousand 2010$US and the degree of democra-tization using the regime scale from the Varieties of Democracy project.The latter is a continuous measure from most authoritarian to mostdemocratic. Next, we incorporate four network variables measuringcolonialism, culture, trade, and spatial proximity. These variables aredescribed in detail in Chapter 1. Briefly, culture refers to similari-ties in time-varying indicators of political liberties, rule of law, genderroles, dominant religion, language group, government ideology, andHuntington’s classification of civilizations. Trade refers to dyadic tradedensities provided from the Correlates of War data and spatial prox-imity refers to capital distances. As network variables, they measure bothdyadic network linkages and the rate of diffusion among closer ties.Thus, their effects are weighted, a process also described in more detailin Chapter 1. See also the methods of Valente (1995).We tested two network diffusion effects of colonialism, one normal-ized where the effect of colonialism is constant after colonialism endsand one where former colonies are still treated as part of the colonialnetwork after independence. This matters little empirically, as in bothcases the point estimates are close to zero and/or show huge confidenceintervals (Models 4 and 5 in both Appendix Tables). Consistent withmodernization arguments, we tested the robustness of our findings usingpercent of the labor force in agriculture for a restricted 83 country sampleusing the Banks CNTS data, but it was not any more informative thanour GDP variable and thus not reported here (see Project Repository forthese results).46 N. Breznau and F. LanverResultsWe start with a descriptive portrayal of the event of nation-state forma-tion in Fig. 2.1. Each row of the figure on the y-axis is a single countryplotted across the years 1880–2010. We centered the year measure sothat year of state formation is zero. Thus, the black vertical line is wheneach state became independent. The dark grey segments represent timeperiods in each nation’s history where there was no work-injury coverage.The brown segments indicate a country has employer liability, and thegreen segments indicate a work-injury social insurance scheme.Figure 2.1 shows that social insurance is something ubiquitouslyintroduced after nation-state formation. This means that establishing aFig. 2.1 Nation-state formation as a “treatment” effect for the introduction ofwork-injury law2 The Global Diffusion of Work-Injury Insurance … 47constitution, declaring independence, or various other events that estab-lished a politically self-ruling state entity are changes in state statusthat occur prior to social insurance introduction. Of 150 countries thatenacted any law, 133 (89%) introduced social insurance. Of the coun-tries that introduced social insurance by 2010, 25 (19%) introduced itduring state formation. Moreover, many countries that have not intro-duced social insurance are much younger (indicated by the missingsegments in the lower right of Fig. 2.1). Whether this is a causal relation-ship, we cannot conclude; however, the fact that many states establishsocial insurance at the moment of statehood or within the first 4 yearsthereafter suggests that social insurance is often part of state and nation-building, given of course that many other factors are at play, and nationbuilding is a process that is continual rather than discrete. Furtherevidence comes from our regression models whose main coefficients aredisplayed in Fig. 2.2 (full results found in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 in theAppendix).In Fig. 2.2, the blue lines refer to Model 2 and the red lines toModel 3 (see Tables 2.1 and 2.2 in Appendix), these models are identicalexcept for the inclusion of network exposure by spatial proximity. More-over, Models 2 and 3 are otherwise identical for the dependent variablesfirst law (left panel, Models “A” in Table 2.1) and first social insuranceFig. 2.2 Discrete-time hazard diffusion models of work-injury law in 150countries, 1880–2010, Log-Odds48 N. Breznau and F. Lanver(right panel, Models “B”). The results reveal that spatial proximity, state-founded, and democratization all exhibit positive statistical associationswith the yearly likelihood of adopting a first law. The effects are consid-ered important because they reflect a plausible statistical range that issignificantly greater than zero with a 95% confidence interval (CI) afterrobust clustering standard errors by country. The “OR ~” labels addedto the plot for the significant coefficients are exponentiated coefficients,“odds ratios,” representing the increase in likelihood of adoption in anygiven year with a one-point increase in that variable, all else equal.The spatial proximity variable is weighted by both the distancebetween the states and the percentage of members adopting a first law,thus it is difficult to interpret. However, we can say that the differencebetween having few other states nearby adopting and most states nearbyadopting is a 31-fold increase in the likelihood of adoption in a givenyear. The CI is very wide, so this is not a highly reliable value and mightrange from just a few times more likely to 50 times more likely.The state-founded variable suggests a 2.2-fold increase in likelihoodof adopting a first law, and the democratization variable has a 1.2-foldincrease. However, we have to keep in mind that odds ratios are alwaysrelative to the actual baseline likelihood of adoption in a given year. Thisis difficult to pinpoint because of the time period dummies necessary inthis type of model. In Table 2.1 we see that an average likelihood of adop-tion in any given period of a first law (Model 3A) is 0.003 or roughly0.3% all else equal. The state-founded variable represents a (2.2*0.3%=) 0.66% likelihood of adoption. The window of five years of stateformation is our test variable, thus the likelihood of adopting at somepoint in the entire five-year period is 3.3%.3 The democratization vari-able is measured on a scale from 0 to 9, so we can say that when a stategoes from a score of 2 (or “rather authoritarian”) to a score of 7 (“ratherdemocratic”) the odds actually increase by (5*1.2 =) sixfold leading to alikelihood of (6*0.3% =) 1.8%; a perceptibly large increase.3 Cumulative probability over X years calculated as 1 −(100 − [percent likelihood in year ]∧X/100∧X).2 The Global Diffusion of Work-Injury Insurance … 49The results are slightly different for adoption of a first social insur-ance law. Here, network exposure to trading partners matters as wellas the other significant effects for any first law. We can say that thestate-founded variable is even more influential. Taking again a roughaverage of 0.3% baseline likelihood (Model 3B) a country is (3.6*5=) 18-fold more likely to adopt during state formation, which is anoverall likelihood of (0.3*18 =) 5.4%, a considerably sized likelihoodin a five-year-period.Note that our selection of Models 3A and 3B was supported by abetter fit to the data than Models 1 or 2 or any robustness checks inboth dependent variables’ cases.DiscussionA political economy perspective on institutions suggests that democraticregimes are more likely to enact universal policies because the citizensare relatively equal, at least in comparison to authoritarian regimes wherecertain groups are often targeted to maintain power (Grünewald 2021).The measure is fraught with uncertainty, however, as who qualified asa voting citizen changed dramatically over time. Women were excludedearly in democratic development and often racial/ethnic/religious groupsas well. Moreover, workers were not citizens in early democracies and thefranchise extended only slowly from high-status landowners or nobilityto petty bourgeoisie to the working masses who were also at first mostlyworking in informal or subsistence labor.What is ostensibly striking is the lack of association of GDP withlikelihood of adoption. We are careful here because democracy could beseen as a process of modernization, or at least as a form of institutionalisomorphism along a modernizing trajectory. Therefore, we do not inter-pret the GDP coefficient as evidence against the modernization thesis.It is more likely an artifact of event history modeling in many coun-tries. The ranking of countries in 1900 is roughly the same in 2000 interms of GDP, and this means that most countries follow more or less a50 N. Breznau and F. Lanveryearly, linear trajectory in GDP growth. Therefore, GDP tracks time inthe hazard model and fails to introduce unique explanatory variance. Todemonstrate why modernization probably matters despite the insignifi-cant GDP coefficient, we divide our countries into a mean split between“high” and “low” GDP in 1900. Then we plot the cumulative hazardrates of adoption in Fig. 2.3 by group. The darker blue hazard lines showthat those with higher GDP in 1900 are more likely to adopt sooner thanthose with lower GDP in 1900. This is evidence of the role of GDP,but we could of course divide the sample into more and less democra-tized and possibly “Western and non-Western cultural spheres” and plota similar hazard rate trajectory. As these are all interrelated (Breznau et al.2011, footnote 5), we do not argue for a direct effect of GDP per se butare careful not to rule out development and modernization as playing animportant role, also indicated by a large effect of democratization in ourmodels.What is not so often explored in the social security and welfare statedevelopment literature is the concept of spatial proximity. The classicstudy by Collier and Messick (1975) and work by Castles and colleagues(Castles and Mitchell 1992) suggests that there are families of nationswhen it comes to social policy adoption timing. Thus, the early adopterswere European, then came the British influence sphere (New WorldFig. 2.3 Cumulative hazard rates of adoption by low versus high GDP in 19002 The Global Diffusion of Work-Injury Insurance … 51and Japan), and then Latin America and so forth. Our study revealsmore about the mechanisms behind this process than the previous worksbecause it includes multivariate event history modeling with networkdiffusion effects. This gives a direct statistical link of dyadic ties andnetwork weighting as a model of the theoretical reality of social exchangeand transmission of ideas through the convenience of spatial contact.In a way, our study opens a new area for researchers to attempt todisentangle trade—what is passed through actions related to economicexchange—from the transmission of ideas based on both convenienceand political networks. We assume that ideas passing through interna-tional organizations such as the ILO, religious and charity organizations,the Communist party, and university exchanges are endogenous to ourmeasure of trade partnerships. States that trade more with each other alsohave exchanges in these other areas. This is often facilitated by sharedculture, language, or geopolitical agendas. As our reproducible code anddata are freely available, we look forward to researchers expanding on ourideas and models. Nonetheless, the trade effect is striking, and we are notaware of a strong theory of policy diffusion based on trade in the welfarestate literature.ConclusionUsing an event history time-series model of 150 countries from 1880 to2010 with the inclusion of network diffusion variables, we show thatstate formation is an important statistical predictor of the introduc-tion of a first work-injury law in a given nation’s history. It is an evenmore important predictor of a first social insurance law, increasing thelikelihood of adoption during the five-year early state formation phaseby 18-fold. This points to the important role of social insurance instate-building. Of course, stronger states with more wealth or geopolit-ical power were more likely to adopt social insurance, especially earlierin their histories, as with the colonial empires of Western Europe andlater the Russian Communist Party ‘empire’ constructed via the Soviet52 N. Breznau and F. LanverUnion where countries adopted social insurance as part of the system ofsocialism. Both western and eastern Europe saw social insurance arriveafter the start of industrialization, but the former did it without workersoverthrowing their governments. In both cases, workers attaining socialprotections, in addition to expanded rights in the transition out ofserfdom, represented a means of constructing a nation in addition toa state (western Europe) or a nation in opposition to the existing state(Russian and Communist revolutions). The cohesiveness of the nation,or what many refer to as solidarity, was built on this enfranchisement andprotection of workers, who in exchange offered more efficient or effectivelabor to improve the state.We argue that state formation and strengthening are compatiblewith power resource theories. Once established, the state is vying forcomplete control over the individuals and organizations within it. More-over, without a productive workforce that has a sense of national unity,the state is less likely to be as economically competitive or as defen-sible against outside invasions. We expect a similar mechanism is atplay between states and industrial workers as with states strategicallyusing social provisions to improve the number of soldiers and theirwillingness to fight for the nation. Thus, the introduction of a socialinsurance scheme that covers all formal industrial workers is a monu-mental state achievement and institutionalizes the state in a way notpresent beforehand. Essentially, the welfare of the state and workerbecome coterminous, where each has an interest in the other via socialinsurance.There are limitations to this study; in particular, the timing of nation-state formation is difficult to measure. Germany became an independentstate in 1871 but before this there was a German people that arguablyconstituted a nation, albeit within various forms of empire. After that,the geopolitical form of Germany changed during and after the WorldWars, and then again with reunification. This is nothing particularlyunique to Germany. Poland had shifting borders throughout the nine-teenth and early twentieth centuries as did China and countries that oncecomprised the Soviet Union. Austria is another challenging measurement2 The Global Diffusion of Work-Injury Insurance … 53case because it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but also oper-ated as a semi-autonomous state introducing social insurance for minersin 1854 independently of the empire. Therefore, we should proceed withcaution in interpreting results, as state formation is not a discrete eventin many cases but an ongoing contested process. Finally, even though wefound no clear association, colonialism may play a role in work-injurypolicy because the effect is confounded by culture and spatial proximity,which many former colonies have in common to some extent.We did not expect an effect of state formation on the introduction ofa first work-injury law, as these were largely not social insurance laws butemployer liability laws that were ineffectual at staving work-related risks.The effect of state formation on social insurance for blue-collar workerswas much larger than on first work-injury laws statistically speaking, butit is not as clear cut as we expected. It is possible that employer liabilityhad a symbolic role in appeasing workers in the very short term and wasthus a step in the nation-state construction process, if only as a gesture.As we measured introduction of policies, we do not capture furtherdevelopments of the state whereby policies are expanded in benefits andcoverage and create even more solidarity, i.e. nation building. Given thenew global data now available for investigating such phenomena, we seegreat potential for further investigation of this and other classic researchon the welfare state that has been characterized by a focus on the GlobalNorth.AppendixSee Tables 2.1 and 2.2.54 N.

Seitzer et al.to education (World Conference on Education for All 1990). Educa-tion has always played a crucial role in society—it prepares studentsto contribute to the labor market and society, ensures social order, andpermits social mobility at the same time: “Education is prestigious, isthought functional for all sorts of goods, and is seen as both individuallyand collectively beneficial” (Strang and Meyer 1993, 502). Social status isheavily influenced by education, increasing the demand for institutionsof mass education, as it promises social mobility and life-chances other-wise unattainable. In addition, well-organized rational bureaucraciesrequire appropriately qualified employees and citizen (Weymann 2014).In short, education closely corresponds with modernization. However,there are different pathways into modernity (Eisenstadt 1986), whichalso depend on different cultures and religions. A crucial aspect of educa-tion is the transmission of norms and values from one generation to thenext. With this, it ensures not only the continuation of traditions butalso influences and shapes the persistence of local and national cultures(Morin 2016; Boyer 2018). As a consequence, the content and shapeof state-organized education is tied to local culture and practices. At thesame time, it is also a result of transnational processes and developments.In this chapter, we elaborate upon the question: what determinants haveshaped the global diffusion of compulsory education policies?Education started to become increasingly important with the risingsignificance of the individual (Ramirez 1989) and with globalizationtrends (Griffiths and Imre 2013). This leads us to the assumption thatstate-regulated education may not only vary in content between culturesbut also have varying degrees of significance for societies, resulting invarying time points of compulsory education introduction. Our hypoth-esis, therefore, is that culture influenced the introduction of compul-sory education around the globe. Despite cultural differences, however,modern education systems are remarkably similar. Most schools havetwo- or three-tier systems (primary, secondary, and tertiary), class struc-tures divided by age-group and front-facing instructions, not to mentionthe focus on mathematics, reading, sciences, history, and physical andarts education, just to name a few (Anderson-Levitt 2003). Yet, the actualcontent of these curricula might differ between cultures. The long-term3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion … 61trend towards isomorphism continues despite remarkable global differ-ences between cultures (Henrich 2020). This perspective, but especiallythe inclusion of shared cultural traits as a pathway of diffusion, has beenignored in research on the development of social policy for far too long.State-organized education is the outcome of religious, economic, andpolitical mechanisms that drive a rationalized society and state, secu-larizing the organizational and institutional rules of the individual’smembership in these units (Weber 1972; Weymann 2014). Educationallows nation states to shift the focus to the individual, which is nowresponsible to take its role in differentiated units of a complex society.It provides the cognitive basis for a (post-)industrialized state’s rationaladministration. Secularization and Western rationalization originatedfrom a particular cultural development in the Occident (Weber 1972),whereas other areas in the world followed different cultural pathways intomodernity (Eisenstadt 1986), which might also affect the establishmentof educational institutions such as compulsory education.However, one has to keep in mind that culture is not the only influ-ential factor on the introduction of social policies such as education.Diffusion research has shown that the transformation and, especially,diffusion of policies are highly dependent on countries’ opportunitiesfor interaction. Therefore, taking a network perspective to study theintroduction of compulsory education should not come as a surprise.The diffusion of compulsory education is, in our perspective, depen-dent on the ties and networks between countries. Therefore, in thischapter, we implement a network diffusion approach by including theexposure to countries that have already adopted compulsory education.The connections in the distinct networks determine the exposure andare, in some cases, volatile over time but also changing in tie strength.We construct the ties between countries through connections of trade,colonial legacies, or spatial proximity.Furthermore, we include a network of shared cultural characteris-tics between countries to test the influence of culture on the diffusionof education policy. According to our approach, countries are moreclosely tied to each other when they share more cultural characteris-tics. How to define “culture,” how culture influences individual behavior,62 H. Seitzer et al.and how cultures differ around the world, are important but contro-versial issues in the social sciences (Anderson-Levitt 2012). In our view,“culture” essentially signifies a shared understanding of reality, which isamong others represented by beliefs as to how society—and its institu-tions—should be structured and organized. Furthermore, aspects suchas religion, language, and societal values make up the complex conceptof “culture” differentiating between social groups. Long-term histor-ical path dependencies led to remarkable differences between globalcultures (Weber 1972), and these differences are still important today(Henrich 2020). Our approach to analyze “cultural spheres” providesa non-essentialist concept of culture. It results in a two-mode networkapproach which provides fuzzy-set clusters with overlapping boundariesand displays a changing structure and membership in these cultural clus-ters over time (Windzio and Martens 2021). However, we will argue thatculture closely relates to other dimensions of multiplex network ties, suchas spatial proximity, colonial past, and global trade. If we want to testwhether cultural similarity is a relevant “pipe structure” of social policydiffusion, which is in our case compulsory education, we must take intoaccount these correlated networks. Hence, the analyses in this chaptertest the diffusion effects of the respective networks against each other.Do we still find effects of cultural similarity on the global diffusion ofcompulsory education after controlling for colonial history, global trade,and spatial proximity? Or is the diffusion rather a result of a combinationof multiplex networks connecting countries globally?TheoryPolicy diffusion as a general umbrella term describes multiple mecha-nisms through which policies travel from one country to another. Theliterature mentions, e.g., (1) learning, (2) competition, (3) imitation, or(4) coercion (Dobbin et al. 2007; Obinger et al. 2013). Which of themechanisms is at work in education policy, however, is difficult to discernusing a macro quantitative design. Nevertheless, there are multiple theo-retical approaches, exploring reasons for the diffusion of compulsoryeducation. A common approach is Meyer and colleague’s World Society3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion … 63theory (Meyer et al. 1997). Another, related explanation can be found in“critical cultural political economy” (CCPE) (Dale 2000) or in Marxistfunctionalist theories such as the World Systems Approach (Wallerstein2004; Griffiths and Imre 2013). We start our theoretical considerationswith World Society theory, enhance it with insights from research onglobal “cultural spheres” and contrast this view with the CCPE approach.In the globalized world society, individuals and organizations areinterested in common institutionalized standards, especially when theyinteract across different national institutions. Aided by powerful Westernstates, modern, Western bureaucracies tend to spread around the world(Meyer et al. 1997) because International Organizations (IOs) requirepredictable organizational standards. World Society revolves around theconstruction of actor-hood, identity, and legitimization of the state andnon-state actors involved in policymaking. In order to gain legitimacy,these actors tend to integrate commonly accepted models or conceptssuch as human rights or even, the concept of a state itself into their ownsystem. Recognition of statehood by external actors with scientific andprofessional authority such as other states, IOs, or other non-state actorshas always been a crucial dimension of the Western political system.This element, according to Meyer and colleagues, has led to the devel-opment of a set of norms and standards, a global culture so to speak,recognized and influenced by all parties of world society (Meyer et al.1997). The implementation of these norms and standards grants legit-imization. Accepting this global culture, however, can be much more aperformative act than an integration of these norms in the local beliefsystem (Steiner-Khamsi 2000)—it can be just “myth and ceremony”(Meyer and Rowan 1977). The participation in International Large ScaleAssessments, for example, is an often used tool to gain attention, gatherfunds such as developmental aid, or simply legitimize a country furtherin the eyes of other nation states (e.g., Kijima 2015). Deviations fromthe general standardized systems as well as failed implementation arenot always a contradiction to the common model. Rather, the confir-mation of these deviations as irregular further validates the existence ofa common model. However, non-compliance with the implicit rules canhave serious negative consequences as well. The non-participation in tests64 H. Seitzer et al.like PISA is penalized: The Human Capital Index by the World Bank—a scale playing the role as a rationalized other with scientific authorityin this instance—is negatively affected for non-participating countries(Liu and Steiner-Khamsi 2020). World society induces isomorphismamong education systems, of which compulsory education is a crucialpart (Meyer et al. 1997).The acceptance of a common set of standards makes interactions easierand increases the chances of ties such as trade, which might be benefi-cial for some states. As a consequence, the perception of national cultureand identity became important issues in the domestic politics in manyWestern countries but also at the global level (Fukuyama 2018). Theadoption of policies according to this model requires an understandingof similarities between the systems, which further increases interactionand finally diffusion (Strang and Meyer 1993).The idea of a world society lends itself to explain the isomorphismof countries’ institutions and the frequent proclamation of policy diffu-sion we see in educational research. Nevertheless, the diffusion processof compulsory education might be shaped and moderated by differentcultures in the world. We do not regard cultures as stable entities herebut as embedded in a network of socially constructed elements. Thereis no objective point of reference between different cultures. Aspects ofvalues, attitudes and social behavior in one culture, such as the degree ofindividualism or collectivism, are just distributed differently in compar-ison to other cultures. In ontological terms, the individualism in theWestgains its existence only in comparison to other cultures that are supposedto be less individualistic. As we know from social network research,components of cultures refer to one another like fuzzy-set clusters andgive meaning to each other (Emirbayer and Goodwin 1994; Emirbayer1997, 299). Here, we are considering additional approaches as influen-tial, especially to account for other globalizing influences than culture,in particular economic aspects. Dale (2000) puts special emphasis onthe economy, in that the education systems we see today are not onlyinfluenced by national culture but also by capitalism as an economicsystem. Although the economic system is also an outcome of specificcultural developments (Weber 1972), Critical Cultural Political Economy3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion … 65places emphasis on interrelations between countries shaped by the capi-talist system at large. Today’s education system prepares students for theneeds of the labor market and graduates from education systems are seton a path to repeat and further stabilize the system. In this approach,capitalism is regarded more as a causal force, responsible for shapingeducation, rather than an outcome (Dale 2000; Robertson and Dale2015). Knowledge, rather than production, translates into economicsuccess (Dale 2005). Here too, diffusion of social policy occurs, albeitfor different reasons than assumed by world society theory. Culture andthe need for legitimization are relevant factors in the diffusion of educa-tion policy, but CCPE might very well be correct in highlighting thespecific influence of the economy in this process.According to the view that economic processes influence educationsystems, the production of goods and services determines a society’seconomic structure and the degree in which information is processed,since information is what modern service economies are about (Hidalgo2015). Even though global economies are based on the division of laborand comparative cost advantages, implying differences in their economicstructure, global trade requires common standards with respect to qualityassessment, commercial accounting, and legal issues regarding the respec-tive transaction. If economic transactions go beyond economic exploita-tion, as we know from colonial dependencies which often came alongwith a transfer of institutions, trade partners are becoming more closelyaligned. Extensive trade between nation states extends communicationand can accelerate economic progress, which is why we assume thatcountries linked in the network of global trade often introduced compul-sory education in similar historical periods. In other words, strengthenedeconomic intersection increases the need for similar institutionalizationsof education systems.Flipping the argument, we might see that similar institutionalizationmight be one pre-requisite for diffusion. We assume that colonial lega-cies might prove influential through building path dependency in theinstitutionalization. Colonial ties between two countries usually implyasymmetric relationships of economic exploitation. Yet, these ties showpossible avenues for a colonial power imposing at least some of its institu-tions upon the colony. This “imperial diffusion” (Kuhlmann et al. 2020)66 H. Seitzer et al.might have been prevalent in the introduction of compulsory educa-tion to pacify conflicts. Additionally, we suspect the influence does notdisappear after colonization ends. Former colonies are still exposed tothe educational institutions of their colonizers. These colonizers proveto still be influential through development aid, for example (Shields andMenashy 2017), or simply because they are a salient reference country(Dobbin et al. 2007, 453). Thus, compulsory education might diffusealso via networks of colonial legacies. To the contrary, it can also beas equally true that local actors strongly repel institutionalization ofeducation following a Western model (Craig 1981, 192).Finally, the basic assumption in policy diffusion research is that spatialproximity strongly facilitates diffusion. Of course, we agree with the viewthat “Space is more than Geography” (Beck et al. 2006), and spatialproximity itself is not a mechanism that could explain policy diffusion.Rather, spatial proximity is an indicator of cognitive, social, cultural,and institutional similarity. On the one hand, this indicator is far frombeing perfect, particularly at the margins of a “cultural sphere” (Windzioand Martens 2021). On the other hand, the determination of spatialdistances is comparatively simple and intuitively easy to follow. We canmeasure spatial proximity itself with less error than the “cultural spheres”.We expect spatial distance to have a “retarding” effect on policy diffu-sion because the opportunity to meet decreases with increasing distance.Possibilities for contact depend on specific mechanisms that might becorrelated with spatial proximity. Accordingly, proximity itself is nota mechanism but has the advantage of a simple and precise measure-ment compared to more complex constructs, such as cultural similarity(Windzio and Martens 2021). Thus, in the following, we empiricallytest the influence of these different network dimensions on the diffusionof compulsory education and control for levels of democratization andGDP per capita in order to take economic and political heterogeneitybetween countries into account.3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion … 67Data andMethodsIn this chapter, we analyze the worldwide diffusion of compulsoryeducation. We coded the year of the adoption of first regulation, makingeducation mandatory for the majority of all children in the respectivecountry. For most cases this means the attendance of state-regulatedschools. We are interested in the moment when the state intervenes inthe education of children and mandates education to be conducted.We, therefore, code the first de jure introduction and disregard actualimplementation as well as abolitions. For example, a law enacted in2000 makes school compulsory in Djibouti, implying school atten-dance. However, 1 in 5 children of primary school age is not attendingschool.2 Another example is Singapore, where high enrollment ratesprecede compulsory education: Here, compulsory schooling was onlyenacted in 2003 with enrollment rates already reaching more than 90%,even 20 years prior to that (Tan 2010). Our data collection is basedon the “World Education Encyclopedia” by Marlow-Ferguson (2002)and the Bloomsbury “Education around the World Series” (e.g., Brockand Alexiandou 2013). We expand the data with extensive research onconcrete laws and a myriad of additional secondary sources.Lastly, we tried to code according to geographic region as best aspossible. North Macedonia, for example, is coded similarly to Serbia andSlovenia because at the time of adoption it was part of the Kingdomof Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes and only later gained independence(Spasenović et al. 2015). Croatia, on the other hand, introduced compul-sory education earlier. For federal states, we decided to code the first lawon compulsory schooling enacted by the central authority. If this was notpossible, we coded the first time of adoption of compulsory schooling ofthe first political entity within the territory, for example, this includedTasmania in 1868 for Australia.Figure 3.1 shows the number of introductions per year (yellow) aswell as the cumulative introduction rate of compulsory education (red).The figure shows that there are only a few points in time where multipleintroductions took place in the same year, for example, around 1920.2 https://www.unicef.org/djibouti/education.68 H. Seitzer et al.Fig. 3.1 Cumulative introduction of compulsory educationConsequently, the cumulative introduction function (red dotted line)is increasing relatively linear. We, therefore, do not assume a strongdependence on certain time periods over the course of history.We assume diffusion through networks of shared cultural similarity(membership in cultural spheres), colonial legacies, trade, and geograph-ical proximity from 1880 to 2010. For this purpose, we analyze data oncultural characteristics of N = 164 countries, including indicators ofpolitical liberties, rule of law, gender roles, dominant religion, languagegroup, government ideology, classification of civilization, and colonialpast (Besche-Truthe et al. 2020). We generated quartiles of continuousmeasurements, e.g., for the index of gender relations, in order to getdiscrete categories for a valued two-mode network. If two countries sharea characteristic, they connect to each other in the network. Most coun-tries establish several relations, for example, by sharing the same languagegroup and the largest religious group. The higher the number of ties inthis network, the closer the cultural proximity between two countries.Rather than homogenous clusters and clear-cut “fault lines,” this methodyields a network of “cultural spheres” with relations of varying inten-sity between countries. The cultural spheres network is time-varying dueto the time-varying measurement of most cultural indicators. Elsewhere,we used the metaphor of a “pipe structure” as the underlying structureof the diffusion process (Windzio and Martens 2021), where the “pipe3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion … 69diameter” is the number of ties in a dyad and thus, the degree of simi-larity of two countries. Larger pipe diameters lead to a higher weight ofa tie and indicate higher “cultural exposure” of country A to country B.This might increase the likelihood of “contagion”, given that a specificpolicy has not yet been adopted in one of the two countries. We regardnetworks of cultural spheres, spatial proximity, global trade, and colo-nial legacies as the underlying pipe structures of the diffusion process.In the spatial proximity network, countries’ ties are weighted by theinverse of the distance of their capitals, and it is therefore the only time-independent network. Trade and colonial legacies, on the other hand,differ over time, where the former shows the logarithmized sum of thevalue of all traded goods between two countries. For the latter, we utilizetwo different operationalizations of colonial legacy. First, we weigh theinfluence of multiple former colonizers against each other. Second, weassume an overall receding influence after decolonization, while assumingthe influence of two colonizers might be stronger than for entities withjust one colonizer (for a detailed description of the data, see Chapter 1 inthis volume). We report the estimation using the latter operationalizationin the appendix.Missing data in our control variable GDP per capita from Varieties ofDemocracy (Inklaar et al. 2018) was interpolated with a logistic func-tion to account for the nonlinear rise of GDP. Where there was no datafrom the first observation in 1880, the data from the income group ofthe respective countries was used as a starting point. The values weretransferred onto a different scale to represent the share of GDP at therespective time points to the maximum value achieved during our timeof observation. The data was then transformed onto a logit scale, inter-polated linearly, and transformed back through an inverse logit functionand onto the original scale. This procedure produces the rise of GDPin a logistic shape, providing a more realistic use of the indicator as alinear interpolation would. The democracy index stems from the V-DemProject (Coppedge et al. 2019). Here, missing data points were interpo-lated linearly. For our analysis, we utilize the R package netdiffuseR(Vega Yon and Valente 2021) which defines exposure as the share of jadopters in the ego-centered network of node i (i \u0002= j ) at time t andis supposed to affect the adoption rate between t and t + 1 (Valente70 H. Seitzer et al.1995). If a country is only connected to other countries that alreadyhave adopted compulsory schooling, exposure is 1. If none have adopted,exposure is 0 (for details of these concepts, see Chapter 1 in this volume).The introduction of compulsory schooling (no compulsory schooling =0 and introduction of compulsory schooling = 1) during the window ofobservation is the dependent variable in our discrete-time logistic hazardmodel. Once a country has introduced compulsory schooling, it dropsout of the risk set. Introductions after 2010 are right-censored, adop-tions before the window of observation begins (before 1880) are notconsidered in the risks set but contribute to the network-exposure ofcountries that have not yet adopted. Since compulsory education is anolder social policy than other policy fields dealt with in this volume, wedo not consider the same number of countries in the regression, as somecountries had introduced compulsory education before 1880. Thus, fromthe initial set of 164 we only keep 117 countries. However, the full setof countries contributed to the estimation of exposure. Further explana-tions on the data and analysis can be found in the introductory chapterof this volume.ResultsTo answer the question of the influence of different networks on thediffusion and consequently introduction of compulsory education, wefirst employed a diffusion model to estimate the effects of contagion indifferent networks. These coefficients were then used in a time-discretelogistic hazard model, estimating the influence of contagion on the finaloutcome, the adoption of compulsory education. Time is modeled asa step function, which means that for every time period of around25 years, a new constant is assumed. In doing so, we account for unob-served heterogeneity that develops over time. Figure 3.2 shows the spreadof compulsory education around the globe. The map indicates thatamong the first countries to implement compulsory education, Westernor English-speaking countries are very prominent. Additionally, someMiddle and South American countries can be counted among the earlyadopters.3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion … 71Fig. 3.2 The global diffusion of compulsory educationTable 3.1 shows the outcomes of the logistic hazard models. First, weestimated the time rates, then included measures for GDP per capita, ademocratization index, and the networks, added step wise. Exposure inthe networks of cultural spheres as well as trade and geographical prox-imity is estimated with a one-year lag. The final regression coefficients arecorrected with a standard error correction for clustered standard errors, toaccount for times when countries to be known as separate entities today,were one political unit. This implicates that during these times adoptionscould have been dependent on the political overlap, hence the correctionof standard errors. The coefficients were transformed to hazard ratios.The interpretation, therefore, goes as follows: Coefficients greater than 1indicate a positive effect while coefficients smaller than 1 indicate a nega-tive effect of the variable in question. The hazard ratios for the networksrepresent the odds of adopting compulsory education, given the exposurethough the network in question to countries, who have already adoptedcompulsory education.72 H.

Cultural similarity, therefore, significantlyincreases the odds of adopting compulsory education. The colonial lega-cies network as well as the trade network show insignificant effects;exposure in these networks does not have a significant impact on theadoption of compulsory education. Geographical proximity, on theother hand, has a positive impact. In addition to its significant and posi-tive coefficient, geographical proximity diminishes the cultural spheresterm’s coefficient to non-significance.Accordingly, in Models (1) to (3) there is no effect of colonial lega-cies or ties in the global trade network, whereas the effect of ties in3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion … 73the cultural spheres network is positive, strong, and highly significant.Modeling an overall receding influence via linkages with former hege-mons shows a significant positive influence of the colonial legacy networkat first sight (see Table 3.2 in Appendix). However, when excludingterritories which have been part of the USSR when they introducedcompulsory education, the effect vanishes.3 Hence, we conclude that,regardless of the operationalization, colonial rule and legacies do not havean overall effect, but rather, affect isolated cases of imperial diffusion.However, post-colonial links are not significant “pipes” through whichcompulsory education policy diffuses.After controlling for spatial proximity, the strong effect of the culturalspheres network vanishes which indicates that exposure in both networksis highly correlated. We should not conclude from these results thatspatial proximity is the only crucial factor for diffusion of compulsoryeducation. Simply for the reason, that spatial proximity itself cannot bea mechanism of diffusion, but rather, is a catch-all indicator. Spatial prox-imity, thereby also, indicates similarity in institutional forms and culture.Even though we captured the influence of culture by controlling for ourcultural spheres network, our cultural spheres are construed by theoret-ical considerations and particular methods (Windzio and Martens 2021;Besche-Truthe et al. 2020). In contrast to the simple measurement ofspatial proximity, the complex procedure to generate cultural spheres isprone to measurement error, which is certainly the reason why the strongeffect of the latter disappears after controlling for the former.ConclusionIn this paper, we tested the impact of four networks of potential policydiffusion on the implementation of compulsory education around theglobe. Education, as a crucial part of today’s welfare state, is influencednot only by national but also international forces. When looking atmodes of diffusion for education policy, culture is a factor that has previ-ously rarely been considered. To test its impact, we utilize a projected3 Model not included.74 H. Seitzer et al.two-mode network of different cultural characteristics such as language,religion, and gender roles. Culture is influencing education, as educationdoes not only prepare students for the labor market but also ensures thecontinuation of local values and traditions. Similar educational standardspromote communication and interaction between countries, increasingthe opportunities of policy diffusion. Similarly, a trade network as well ascolonial legacies as channels for policy diffusion have been considered aswell. Additionally, a network of geographical proximity, GDP per capita,and a democratization index were considered as control variables.The results show, that even when controlling for democratizationand GDP per capita, culture does indeed matter. Exposure through thecultural similarity network was consistently significant and positive, untilthe geographical proximity was brought in. Neither colonial legaciesnor trade could produce significant results, even without controlling forcultural spheres. This is an unexpected outcome, as one could assumethat similar educational standards might emerge through the need ofstandardization for trade. Unfortunately, we do not assess imbalances intrade or goods. In any case, trade as a “pipe structure” of policy diffusionwas not proven significantly influential. Similarly, colonial relationshipsclearly show that they did not influence the diffusion of compulsoryeducation. The suppression of the cultural spheres effect through theexposure effect from the geographical proximity network is, however, notas surprising. The correlation of exposure in these very networks is 0.919(see Chapter 1 in this volume), signifying that closely located countriesoften share similar cultural traits, explaining the correlation between thenetworks.In the end, this result is not easily interpretable. On the one hand,the effect of the cultural spheres network on diffusion vanishes aftercontrolling for spatial proximity, on the other hand, researchers oftenregard spatial proximity just as an indicator of mechanisms that areoften embedded in communication, social interaction, and culture. Sincethe measurement of cultural spheres is much more complex, and theconstruct itself depends on contingent decisions made by the researchers,the resulting measurement error is a crucial disadvantage for the cultural3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion … 75spheres network, when compared with spatial proximity and testingthe significance of influences on diffusion. We should, therefore, notconclude that the network of cultural proximity has no influence, andspatial proximity is the crucial determinant because of the measurementerror and the lack of theoretical meaning of spatial proximity. In otherwords, a theoretical explanation by spatial proximity cannot be doneindependently of other, more social or cognitive arguments (Beck et al.2006).As discussed previously, the membership in cultural spheres does influ-ence the introduction of compulsory education, at least to some degree.This result goes in line with our theoretical assumption that educationis not only derived from singular national factors and history but thatlegitimization and adaption to external units is an important aspect ofpolicy diffusion. The increasing isomorphism of education systems orat least the global agreement that education should be accessible for alland, therefore, compulsory, are determined by cultural and geograph-ical proximity. The fact that neither the trade network nor GDP percapita showed significant results, do not negate the economic influenceeducation policy is subjected to, but rather, signify that these measuresare not indicative of this influence. When GDP per capita and trade aretaken out of the analysis, the model fit declines.4 Research on educationpolicy diffusion should not ignore economic factors but should includecultural factors in addition to the “usual suspects.” We do not attempt todisprove Robertson and Dale’s theoretical approach; we simply supportthe development of this hypothesis further and consider culture in addi-tion to economic factors with a more substantial approach than previoustheories do.Culture is an explanation for the global diffusion of compulsoryeducation in line with sociological neo-institutionalism. This theoryargues in favor of a global diffusion of institutional forms and4 Model not included.76 H. Seitzer et al.content within education. As argued in the section on theory, neo-institutionalism expects a global spread of Western bureaucratic insti-tutions, even though their adoption seems to be in some countriesrather myth and ceremony than a serious implementation (Meyer andRowan 1977). In addition, this process of diffusion is shaped by culturalspheres. These cultural spheres, however, are considerably correlated withspatial proximity between countries. Future research should systemati-cally account for the interaction of network-exposure and historical timeperiods in order to test, if or how the respective network effects changeover time.LimitationsAs any other study, this analysis has its limitations. First, the qualityof data dating back to 1880 might influence the result. The difficultyof modeling longitudinal analyses with a changing country sample forthe same geographical area should be kept in mind. Units such as theUSSR as well as Austria-Hungary, for example, have been taken intoaccount by correcting for clustered standard errors. Nevertheless, thismethod has its weaknesses too. Second, as briefly discussed, educationpolicy is highly shaped by the activities of International Organizationsuch as the OECD. A network of membership in international organiza-tions could have been added to the analysis to account for this diffusionchannel as well, but this effect was left for future researchers to discover.Despite these limitations, we are convinced that the model presentedhere still demonstrates interesting results, as it reveals not only the stronginfluence of culture on education but also shows the weak influence ofdemocratization and GDP on the adoption of compulsory education.AppendixSee Table 3.2.3 Networks of Global Policy Diffusion … 77Table 3.2 The introduction of compulsory education in N = 117 countries—non-normalized exposure in colonial legacies network(1) (2) (3) (4)1880–1914 0.001*** 0.001*** 0.001*** 0.0004***1915–1929 0.002*** 0.002*** 0.002*** 0.001***1930–1954 0.001*** 0.001*** 0.001*** 0.0003***1955–1979 0.001*** 0.001*** 0.0004*** 0.0002***1980–2010 0.001*** 0.001*** 0.0004*** 0.0001***state existed (=1,else =0)6.836*** 5.123***GDP per capita/US$10,0001.020 1.020 1.018 0.976democratization 1.069 1.069 0.995 1.025networkscultural spheres netw.:w. exposure(lag 1 year)128.387*** 129.283*** 36.141** 2.059colonies netw.: wexposurenon-normalized1.007 1.666* 1.586*trade netw.: w. exposure(lag 1 year)0.864 0.758spatial proximity netw.:w. exposure(lag 1 year)113.730***Observations 8614 8614 8614 8614Log Likelihood −550.627 −550.627 −532.155 −522.491Akaike Inf.

Thepolicies are supposed to advance individuals’ economic possibilities andfoster inclusion into society at large (e.g., UNESCO 2015). As a policyfield, ABE is situated between education policy and active labor marketpolicy (ALMP) as well as being ingrained in human rights discourses.Data on first introductions of ABE policy show an accelerating surge in1This chapter is a product of the research conducted in the Collaborative Research Center“Global Dynamics of Social Policy” at the University of Bremen.

Besche-Truthenational policy adoption from the 1960s onwards. This chapter empir-ically investigates the spread of ABE policies all over the globe. In myanalysis, I take domestic variables into account, but focus primarily onnation states’ interdependencies. As we know from the extensive canonof policy diffusion research (e.g., Gilardi 2016; Obinger and Schmitt2011; Dobbin et al. 2007), clustered policy adoption involves commu-nication between actors. Thus, diffusion essentially happens in multiplexnetworks through which actors are connected to each other (Valente1995). This chapter highlights the diffusion of ABE policies by asking:What are the main network determinants for the adoption of first ABElegislation? In my analysis, I draw on the global network data that is usedthroughout this edited volume. Precisely, these networks are depictingcultural similarity, colonial legacies, trade, and geographic proximity.The adoption of ABE policy marks a political act in which actors,at least nominally, problematize the existence of adults without formalschooling and consciously opt for taking on the problem as a matterof the nation state. It becomes a responsibility which needs to beinstitutionalized in law. Passing a policy, however, does not at all safe-guard its implementation. Nonetheless, with policy adoption countriessignal their valuation of the policy’s theorized impact and gain legiti-macy in the global system of nation states. Adopting a policy on ABEmakes sense economically and rationally as well as from a human rightsperspective. Countries not adopting would have the burden of proof fornon-adoption.This chapter advances on the de jure adoption of ABE as both acompensatory and a preventive social policy. On the one hand, it istargeted at adults (and often adolescents) who fell through the cracksin the formal education system, i.e., compensating for inferiority inchildren’s education, sometimes being called “second chance educa-tion” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2012, 25). On the other hand,education in general and adult education in particular are framed asdirectly impacting the economic and social development of an indi-vidual, thereby preventing later costs for the social security system (e.g.,World Bank 1995); essentially following the logic of better (or anyinstitutionalized) education equals better and safer (regular) jobs. Espe-cially the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 85(OECD) is a key player in connecting skills with economic progress (e.g.,https://oecdskillsforjobsdatabase.org).While the influence of IOs on global education discourses is unques-tionable, the diffusion of ABE policy is still a blind spot with little tono global macro studies. Using network diffusion analysis, I aim to esti-mate the influence of networked relations of nation states on ABE policyadoption. This chapter progresses with a short introduction of the globaldiscourse on ABE and the topic itself. After a brief section on theo-ries of policy diffusion, I will turn to the empirical part testing possiblehypotheses on the influence of domestic as well as relational variables.Lastly, I will present the estimations and draw conclusions that ought tomotivate future research.Adult Basic EducationGlobal discourse on institutionalized adult education started in 1949when the UNESCO commenced the first “Conférence Internationalesur l’Education des Adultes” (CONFINTEA) in Helsingør, Denmark—arecurring conference bringing together policymakers, NGOs and expertson topics concerning adult education (Knoll 2008).A Google Ngram (in Appendix) suggest, discourse on “Adult Educa-tion” as well as its French translation peaked in the 1950s but stayedat a high rate until decreasing in the 1980s, only to be exceeded by themore encompassing term “Lifelong Learning”. IOs like the UNESCOand specifically its sister organization the UNESCO Institute for Life-long Learning (UIL) were of significant impact in the emergence andevolution of international conversations on the issues of lifelong learning(LLL) and, accordingly, adult education (Jakobi 2009). This chapterfocuses on the diffusion of one part of the vast thematic complex ofLLL, which is adult basic education. The “Recommendation on AdultLearning and Education”, which was adopted at the UNESCO GeneralConference in 2015, states that adult education comprises informal,non-formal, and formal education which aims at fostering adults’ partic-ipation in society and work (UNESCO 2015, 6). The idea of developingand enriching capabilities for living and working give those learning86 F. Besche-Trutheschemes a very important role in the education system of the respec-tive state. This chapter deals with ABE policy as the constitutive part ofstate-led adult education endeavors, which are also specifically targetedat marginalized groups.There are several ways of raising the skill level of a society, but offeringbasic education to those who did not gain any formal education in child-hood is, in combination with widening access to school education ingeneral, the most effective. It is situated in an ingrained human rightsdiscourse in which “Education for All” problematizes the existence of un-or undereducated adults. The topic of adults’ skill development indis-putably gained importance in global education and economic policy(Jakobi 2009, 55f.). Debate increased despite isolated critiques from theWorld Bank (Torres 2009), mainly concerned with missing returns oninvestment in adult education in general. Nevertheless, ABE policieshave spread around the globe quite rapidly.The map in Fig. 4.1 depicts the de jure adoptions of ABE policiesfor 164 countries. In comparison to other social policies dealt with inthis volume, the map shows that diffusion of ABE policies started ratherlate with Finland in 1921 as the first country to introduce; followed byTurkey in 1929, and the USSR as well as Germany in 1957 and 1953,Fig. 4.1 ABE policy adoption map4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 87respectively. The bulk of adoptions started in the 1960s and acceleratedin the 1990s and 2000s (see below).The UNESCO has been pushing for adult education since its foun-dation (Jakobi 2009, 67f.) with its “Conférence Internationale surl’Education des Adultes” (CONFINTEA) hosted by the UIL. The 1985conference in Paris “established a new right—the right to learn for all,throughout life. Special attention was to be paid to marginalized groupssuch as women, youth, the elderly, minorities […]” (Bhola 1989, 57).Now, virtually all IOs active in education or economy refer to thestrategy of learning and skill formation throughout the whole lifetimeas key for successful education and economic systems (see, e.g., OECD2012; UNESCO 2017; World Bank 2003; World Conference on Educa-tion for All 1990); intergovernmental organizations follow the same path(European Council 2011; African Union 2016). The rise in attention tothe educational needs of adults is part of the general universalizing trendin education. According to Weymann, inclusive education for everyoneat every stage of their life is the “undisputed normative goal” (2016,19; translation by author). The goal is to create equal opportunities byproviding access to adequate competences and knowledge and avoidingthe emergence of a disadvantaged group of both low- and not formallyskilled workers (see Spilker 2013, 102).Theories of Policy DiffusionThe mechanisms behind global policy adoption trends can be as diverseas policies themselves. Indeed, one of the main ideas behind this editedvolume is to test different assumptions within different (social) policyfields. Dobbin et al. (2007) describe four major theoretical strands whenit comes to diffusion research: constructivism, coercion, competition, andlearning . Elkins and Simmons (2005) take a stricter route when theyconfine diffusion to a process driven by uncoordinated interdependence.In its rawest form, in this volume, diffusion is defined as “any processwhere prior adoption of a trait or practice in a population alters theprobability of adoption for remaining non-adopters” (Strang 1991, 325).With these mechanisms and definitions in mind, it is no surprise that88 F. Besche-Truthea myriad of scholars has argued for different paths of policy diffusion.These paths are, furthermore, very diverse depending on the policy fieldand, sometimes, on the country sample used. In the following, I attemptto summarize past evidence and theoretical bases that might be relevantfor the diffusion of ABE. Accordingly, I introduce the networks whichserve to depict possible diffusion avenues.ConstructivismIn a constructivist view, policy adoption is a matter of ideology with poli-cies representing appropriate and legitimate means to important ends.Both are socially constructed, thus, shifting over time and space (Dobbinet al. 2007, 451). Especially in the field of education policy, a lot of schol-arship is situated in neo-institutionalist accounts, which, in its purestform, is the most popular in the constructivist camp. These scholars seeshifts in recognizing problems that are universal to all states and bring upuniversal solutions for those problems rooted in the world society (Meyeret al. 1997). All around the globe, actors, including nation states, legit-imize themselves by holding on to universally legitimized world modelslike citizenship, the need for education, capitalist economy, etc. Thesupposedly “best” models gain such a strength that their raison d’être istheir rationality, legitimization without being questioned, and universalapplicability (Meyer et al. 1997).ABE being framed as a human right is both an indicator for thenormative institutionalization as well as cause for further institutional-ization. Spilker finds that (in Germany) the discourse on educationalopportunities has shifted toward risk groups that, due to a lack ofeducation, are unable to participate in the globalized world (2013, 74).Illiteracy and lack of skills are major problems that need to be tackledby governments, creating an enormous pressure on states to enact poli-cies. Refusal to offer new educational opportunities through ABE appearsas a failure to render assistance (Spilker 2013, 225). Moreover, theglobal discourse specifically targets whole political entities that are notsufficiently participating in the globalized world (e.g., UNESCO 2017).4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 89The emergence of the norm of formally skilled and educated citi-zens of every age is shaping policies all over the globe. The norm itselfis shaped and carried throughout the international sphere not only bystates but especially through professionals and epistemic communitieswhich are most likely found in IOs and science (Meyer et al. 1997,166). In this light, the “institutional conditions for diffusion” (Strangand Meyer 1993) and not national differences are key in understandingthe phenomenon itself. Diffusion is greatly accelerated in instances whereactors fall into the same category and conceptions of formal organi-zations are institutionalized (Strang and Meyer 1993, 490–491). Forthe latter that means that “theoretical accounts of practices simplifyand abstract their properties and specify and explain the outcomes theyproduce” (Strang and Meyer 1993, 497). Actors, on the other hand, aretheorized as sufficiently similar so that practices can have similar effectsall over the globe.The ensuing institutionalization culminates in an impressive isomor-phism of state structures and policies that are not easily explainedby classic functionalist theories. Consider, for example, the cumulativeadoption plot in Fig. 4.2: On the x-axis one sees the year of observa-tion and the y-axis represents the percentage of countries in the specificWorld Bank income group that have adopted an ABE policy. We candiscern that the general trend of policy adoptions only started in 1960and accelerated until almost 90% of high-income and around 70%of low-income countries adopted an ABE policy. Differences in slopesbetween the income groups are hardly visible. This is in line with neo-institutionalist theory, in that the global discourse seems to render otherinfluences nugatory. Following this logic, one would assume no statisti-cally significant influence of either national factors or interdependencies.On the other hand, a lot of scholars decidedly diverge from the teleo-logical neo-institutionalism. Though I am unable to test the underlyingmicro-mechanisms of policy adoption, I aim at testing the influence ofthe macro-structures nation states have built. In line with this editedvolume, it is clear that countries have multiplex ties with one another,i.e., they have ties in different dimensions. I regard these networks asthe underlying structure through which communication, and, hence,diffusion happens. This underlying structure can be best explained by90 F. Besche-TrutheFig. 4.2 ABE policy adoptions by income groupa “pipe-structure” (Martens and Windzio 2021). The innovation, in thiscase ABE policy, travels through the pipes and actors that are exposed toother actors that already adopted a policy should have a higher risk ofadopting the policy itself (see below). The underlying structures, investi-gated in this chapter, are cultural similarity, colonial legacies, trade, andspatial proximity. In the following, I will give a short overview of all thesestructures.Cultural SimilaritySince education is inherently intertwined with culture, i.e., is reproducedby and reproduces specific cultural configurations, being exposed to aculturally similar country that has already introduced ABE might proveinfluential. The influence of world society is not ignored, but ratherthought to be not as influential as neo-institutionalists would suspect.Hence, external ideational influences are translated into cultural config-urations and, thereby, probably so much skewed that the general pattern4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 91of adoptions of ABE policies is affected. For instance, values of meritoc-racy, i.e., the individual being the locus of development, would prompt astate to address under-education when the problem comes up in politicaldebate (Ramirez 1989). On the other hand, adoptions of ABE might bedelayed in countries that show more familialistic community structures.In these compositions, the penetration of the global discourse might takelonger to be actualized through policy (Pfau-Effinger 2005; Boli et al.1985). This would constitute waves of diffusion in which the exposureinside cultural spheres has an impact on the rate of adoption. For thispurpose, I will estimate the effects of a network of cultural similarities.The basis for that is a two-mode network which connects countries withcultural characteristics such as dominant religion, civil and gender liber-ties, government ideology, and language group (for a detailed descriptionsee Chapter 1 in this volume). Through a one-mode projection on thecountry set, the resulting network links countries to one another ifthey share cultural characteristics. Furthermore, the ties are weightedby the number of shared characteristics and through their time-variantnature, the network is time-variant itself (Besche-Truthe et al. 2020).With this approach, we build a flexible and more encompassing defi-nition of culture which shows overlapping cultural spheres rather thanrigid boundaries between groups of countries. Staying true to the pipemetaphor, one can discern that the more similar countries are, the largerthe pipe is through which ABE policy can diffuse.Colonial LegaciesIn a world full of power imbalances coercion theorists argue that hege-monic actors exercise a lot of influence over weaker actors. I includea network depicting power imbalances as countries’ colonial relations.Contrary to some widely used operationalization like, e.g., the GravityModel by CEPII in which a colonial tie is constant over time andeither existent or non-existent, this network is based on time-variantdata spanning as far back as the sixteenth century and includes formerlyoverlooked forms of “colonization” such as the Ottoman Empire or theUSSR. The raw data stems from the COLDAT dataset by Becker (2019).92 F. Besche-TrutheAdditionally, I am able to not only catch “imperial diffusion” (Kuhlmannet al. 2020, 85) but account for past colonial relationships as well. Thus,I assume the influence of a previous colonial power that has alreadyended getting proportionally smaller to the currently existing colonialpower. When the country then becomes completely independent, theproportions of influence no longer differ from each other (for a detaileddescription see Chapter 1 in this volume). Since a comprehensive theorydescribing the mechanism of post-colonial ties between countries onpolicy diffusion in a macro-perspective is missing, I use the possibilityto report a second operationalization of the experience of colonial legacy,in that they have an overall declining strength on the diffusion process(see Appendix). Lastly, the network is directed—which means I assumethat only the metropole influences the diffusion process and not viceversa.In the colonial ties network, I expect to find metropoles which intro-duced ABE and which extended the policy to countries still undercolonial rule (Kuhlmann et al. 2020). This could be especially valid fortight colonial interlinkages based on political ideologies. For instance,Obinger and Schmitt (2011) demonstrate that social policy making wassubject to political regime competition during the ColdWar. Introducingpolicies to advance the average education of the work force not only helpsin technological advancement but keeps (colonial) subjects satisfied and“in line” with the current ideology by projecting a caring state as well aspromising opportunities for better pay in higher skilled jobs. Addition-ally, former colonies receive a significantly higher amount of donationsfrom their former occupiers than other countries (Shields and Menashy2019). Furthermore, former colonies, to some extent, orientate them-selves toward the metropoles either positively or negatively. On the onehand, policies might be emulated because they appear on the publicagenda and are perceived as valuable (Dobbin et al. 2007, 453). Pathdependencies laid out through institutionalizations during the period ofcolonization might play a huge role as well (Kuhlmann et al. 2020). Onthe other hand, knowledge about policy adoptions in former metropolescould very well culminate in a strong retention of this very policy, whichwould manifest in a negative or at least non-significant relation. In short,relations with a higher intensity might increase the possibility for contact4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 93and orientation on policy models of the metropole, especially becausethis network can catch possible path-dependencies that started with colo-nization. Nevertheless, the opposite could be true, which would manifestitself in negative coefficients.Trade and Geography NetworkBased on Marxist research, policies are increasingly influenced by inter-linkages of countries as a direct result of economic and social global-ization (Dale 1999). We see the influence mostly in policies with directimpacts on the economy, e.g., neoliberal tax policy (Swank 2006). Diffu-sion is rarely observed for policies that take a long time to become fruitfullike infrastructure investments (Dobbin et al. 2007, 458). If economiccompetition plays a huge role in policy diffusion, one would expectreinforcement of existing power imbalances. Already powerful countriescould have larger impacts on the spread of policies than weaker coun-tries; with, for instance, Swank showing the pivotal role of US tax policyin the neo-liberalization of Western tax regimes (Swank 2006). On asimilar note, Jahn (2006) shows a “race to the bottom” in social spendingthrough economic ties in the OECD.Also, research on active labor market policies in the EU shows free-rider effects of neighboring countries (Franzese and Hays 2006). Isuspect these effects to also be visible in the global trade network: Ifone country has the upskilling policy of ABE in place, it might demoti-vate a strongly connected country to implement the same, thus slowingthe diffusion process. Although education expansion has been shownto be a result of a growing integration into the global economy (Grif-fiths and Imre 2013, 51), it is unclear what to expect when taking thetrade network as structural basis for the diffusion of ABE policy. Espe-cially in this case, the intermediary role between education and ALMpolicy might dampen economic impacts. The data used to build anundirected time-variant trade network were drawn from the “Correlatesof War Project” (Barbieri and Keshk 2016). Total trade values betweentwo countries were logarithmically transformed and are used as relationalweights (for a detailed description see Chapter 1 in this volume).94 F. Besche-TrutheLastly, I consider countries’ geographic proximity as a structure ofthe multiplex ties which aides in establishing communication channelsthrough which diffusion can happen. In this network, countries are morestrongly connected the geographically nearer they are to each other (for adetailed description see Chapter 1 in this volume). With increased prox-imity, I believe, the probability of direct connection of large numbers ofthe population, cross-border work arrangements, politically institution-alized meetings, research endeavors, etc. increases as well. Additionally, aneighboring country serves in most cases as a more prominent ground forcomparison. Exposure to policies in the geographic proximity network is,therefore, a catch-all indicator which still can show significant influenceon the diffusion of ABE policies (Maggetti and Gilardi 2016, 93). Thus,it functions as a control variable which non-geographic interdependen-cies need to withstand. More directly, however, in combination witheducation and skills, we find these effects of positive externalities throughpolicies of adjacent states for example in the phenomenon of brain drain.The 2019 Global Education Monitoring Report, for instance, finds thatpersons who emigrate are on average highly educated (UNESCO 2018,38). If the supply of adults with basic skills is met through immigrationfrom nearby countries, a state would not need to invest in basic skills ofits own population. By looking at geographic proximity and trade rela-tions, I hope to consider free-rider effects, especially in circumstances ofpositive externalities (see also Franzese and Hays 2006).MethodsThe empirical part of this chapter will test the influence of the describednetworks as structural bases for diffusion. As dependent variable, firstintroductions of ABE policies were collected for N = 164 countries. Idefine ABE as education targeted at adults with low or no proficiency inbasic skills, with the explicit aim to teach these skills. For instance, theNorth Macedonian Law on Primary Education (Official Gazette of R.Macedonia No. 44/95) qualifies because in Article 6 it stipulates: “Theprimary education of adults can be organized in a mainstream primaryschool” (emphasis added by Fabian Besche-Truthe). Another example4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 95would be the Brazilian Lei de Diretrizes e Base da Educação Nacionalsection V, article 37, which determines that adult education should begeared toward those who did not have either access to or continuity inprimary and secondary education at the right age. It is the first actualmentioning of ABE in Brazilian federal education laws, despite its longhistory of literacy campaigns from civil society. These civil society literacyprograms, however, do not qualify as being coded, with this chapterdealing with the momentum of nation states taking responsibility inABE.In accordance with the edited volume at hand, the time frame ofinquiry spans from 1880 to 2010. Although the first introductionhappened in 1921, in theory, countries were at risk of adopting an ABEpolicy at all times. The exposure variables have been calculated usingthe netdiffuseR package (Yon and Valente 2017), and I predict hazardratios by using a discrete-time logistic hazard model . Network exposureis calculated as the weighted average of alters that already adopted ABEpolicy ego is connected to. If, for instance, ego trades equally with twocountries, and one of them has already adopted ABE policy, the expo-sure would be 1/2 = 0.5. For all networks, the weights distinguishingbetween strong and weak connections are taken into account (for adetailed description see Chapter 1 in this volume).To control for time-dependency, i.e., unobserved heterogeneity, Icontrol for time as a piecewise constant rate function. Other chaptersin this volume choose rather steady time intervals of 25 years each, butI diverge from this operation because, first, since adoptions start quitelate, I would assess time periods without any event which would greatlydistort the estimation. Secondly, in accordance with theories describedabove, I believe the global discourse to have a great determining effect onthe overall susceptibility of nation states to introduce ABE policies. Thus,I make use of the CONFINTEA as the determining cut points of timeslices. Figure 4.3 shows these points in accordance with counts of yearlyadoptions. Especially the conference in Paris was revered by Westerncountries claiming that a new “right to education for all” was instituted(Bhola 1989). Other commentators simply see the conference as a shifttoward a neo-liberalist direction (Knoll 2008, 141). Indeed, one cansurmise a spike in yearly adoptions between the conferences of Paris in96 F. Besche-TrutheFig. 4.3 ABE policy adoptions per year (Note The largest number of adop-tions [third bar from the left] is due to the USSR introducing ABE which isautomatically valid for a high number of single countries as well)1985 and Hamburg in 1997. All in all, this builds the base of a vertical,i.e., top-down, diffusion against which other effects and interdependen-cies need to align. Technically it means that for every period betweenconferences a new baseline hazard of policy adoption is assumed.As control variables, I introduce GDP per capita (Inklaar et al.2018) and levels of democratization (Lührmann et al. 2018). Both havebeen interpolated for missing data points as described in Chapter 1of this volume. Including the former is supposed to control for botheconomic performance and states’ financial capabilities. I presume thatmore educated persons are needed if high economic performance shouldbe maintained. Moreover, economic performance serves as a proxy forstate budgetary opportunities to actually implement ABE policy whichwould make it more likely that the policy is adopted in the first place.Also, I suspect the more democratic a system is, the more possi-bility there is for participation and actively trying to influence politicaldecisions toward more social spending (Lindert 2004), which includesopening education for the masses. On the other hand, democracies might4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 97prove resilient to ABE because marginalized groups have less opportu-nity to actually participate although it is a free democracy. As shown byPaglayan (2021), autocracies have expanded school education by a largemargin to keep the populace in line. Education is here a double-edgedsword, it serves as enculturation in the nation state’s will but at the sametime can give individuals the means to overthrow the status quo (Grif-fiths and Arnove 2015, 91). Though the USSR is among the first actorsto introduce ABE, other non-democratic regimes fall into the group oflate adopters.Lastly, I include a variable representing the problem pressure. Mysuspicion is straightforward: The higher the number of adults withoutformal educational attainment is, the higher is the pressure to implementABE as a salvation for these individuals and a quick upskilling of thepopulation. Thus, I depict the percentage of adults without any formalschooling attainment, i.e., they did not finish primary school (Barroand Lee 2015). Also, high rates of persons with no formal schoolingshould make the global discourse fall on open ears more easily. Especiallybecause IOs might publicly problematize these statistics while depictingthem as easily fixable through adult education policies. Furthermore,with the average of formally unskilled adults over extended periods oftime, I do, in part, proxy the general capabilities, performance andpast importance of formal, state-led education. Large values indicatea suboptimal inclusion rate as well as a potential undervaluing of thestate’s formal education. The data in five-year intervals has been linearlyinterpolated.Finally, I face a problem with non-independent observations: Thereare historical time periods in which several countries did not exist becausethey were part of a larger, embracing unit, e.g., Croatia was part ofYugoslavia. In the following network diffusion model, I address thisstatistical non-independence by correcting for heteroscedasticity withrobust standard errors (for a detailed description see Chapter 1 in thisvolume).98 F.

After several estimations, I optedto include the interaction effect of exposure in the trade network andproblem pressure. The significance levels as well as model fit statisticsjustify this decision.First, while refraining from substantially interpreting the effects ofthe different time slices, it is worth noting that they are all signif-icant and somewhat differing in size. That means that the baselinehazard to adopt ABE policy is different considering the time betweenCONFINTEA meetings and the highest after the one in Paris (1985–1997). Although this might reflect other similar global or domesticdevelopments, I suspect it as being consistent with the neo-institutionalaccount of differing strengths of norms in world society.Exposure to culturally similar countries that already adopted an ABEpolicy proves to be a significant positive influence even when consideringexposure in some other networks. In combination with the spatial prox-imity network, it is only significant on the 10% level and after includingthe pressure variable, the effect becomes insignificant, hinting at only asmall role of culture in the diffusion process. On the other hand, thecolonial ties network has a robust and positive effect on the adoptionrisk. Regardless of additional variables, the estimated hazard ratio staysalmost the same with, e.g., 2.635* in the last model. One confoundinginfluence, however, is that Russia, being defined as a colonizer, influencesthe adoption of ABE policy in almost all USSR countries. Indeed, whendeleting these countries from the estimation and running the modelsagain, exposure in the colonial ties network no longer proves to be asignificant influence (see Table 4.3 in Appendix).Trade, as hypothesized, has a negative influence on the risk of adoptionof ABE all models. This leads me to believe that strong trade relationswith a country that already had implemented ABE decreases the adop-tion risk. The estimation, however, shows a huge limitation: throughestimating an interaction with problem pressure we see that exposurein trade networks affects countries with differing strengths.As shown in Fig. 4.4 a country with a large formally unskilled popu-lation has a higher risk of policy adoption with exceeding exposure in100 F. Besche-TrutheFig. 4.4 Interaction effects (Note The graph shows the predicted probabili-ties of adopting ABE in relation to exposure in the trade network. The linesrepresent the change in predicted probabilities for a country with the meanpercentage of adults without formal schooling [47.06] as well as for countrieswith a value of one standard deviation below [15.17] or beyond [78.96] themean)the trade network than countries with generally lower percentages ofunskilled adults. Exposure in the trade network still has a negative effecton risks of policy adoption, however, the smaller the percentage of adultswith formal education gets, the more dampened is this effect. Althoughthis difference through interaction is quite small, it hints at the free-ridereffects described by Franzese and Hays (2006) being stronger in countrieswith larger shares of formally educated adults, e.g., OECD countries.The described effects even hold against controlling for geographicexposure to ABE policies. It makes it all the more enlightening to see therobustness with the coefficients being not strongly affected by controllingfor exposure through spatial proximity as well as economic developmentand democratization.In sum, we can for certain discern two specific network effects. Onthe one hand, links through (past) colonial relationships significantlyincrease the risk of adopting. Hence, we see a case of imperial diffusion(Kuhlmann et al. 2020) in that the USSR’s early adoption of ABE poli-cies impacted all the dependent countries as well. Not considering USSRcountries in the regression estimation, while still having them contributeto network exposure, makes democratization borderline significant onthe 10% level, though with a rather small coefficient of 1.087+ (see4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 101model 1 in Table 4.3 in Appendix). This somewhat hints at a certaindegree of regime competition between the East and West, in that demo-cratic non-USSR states seem to have a slightly higher risk of adopting,all other things equal.On the other hand, high exposure to trade partners that alreadyadopted ABE decreases the risk of policy adoption for countries by thequite large factor of 0.099*, although a higher margin of formally unedu-cated adults slows this dampening effect down. Nevertheless, with a totaladoption rate of 75% the diffusion itself will probably not be entirelystopped.Lastly, considering the operationalization of an overall receding influ-ence of colonial legacies, i.e., non-normalized exposure rates, only afew differences are discernable. The results, presented in Table 4.2 inthe Appendix, clearly affirm the weakness of the previously mentionedinteraction effect since it loses significance. Solely the main effect of thepercentage of adults without formal schooling shows a negative influenceon the adoption risk, corroborating the assumption that a weak stateeducation system slows down the adoption of new (inclusive) educationpolicies. Again, not considering USSR countries in the estimation showsthat exposure through colonial ties is, although significant in the fullsample, mainly influenced by the USSR (see Appendix Table 4.3).ConclusionThis chapter dealt with the diffusion of policies on adult basic educa-tion by estimating the effects of network determinants on the adoptionof first ABE policy. I stressed the policy as marking a specific politicalact in which states problematize the existence of adults without formalschooling and consciously opt for taking on the problem as a matterof the nation state. In that regard, ABE with its preventive and compen-satory rectification intersects not only with human rights discussions andextensions but also fits into the spread of human capital theory after102 F. Besche-TrutheWorld War II. The surge is mirrored in the concurrent adoptions of ABEpolicies which sped up in the 1980s and 1990s. By 2010 almost 90%of all countries assessed had introduced ABE policy. I utilized networkdiffusion analysis to macro-quantitatively assess which of the multiplexties of countries around the globe were most prevalent. In doing so,I utilized four different social networks, connecting countries to eachother: cultural similarity, colonial legacies, trade, and spatial proximity. Ihypothesized that especially the global discourse in the world society isvery influential in the diffusion. Following neo-institutionalist theory,domestic variables as well as interlinkages would be rendered nugatoryover time.Accordingly, the results show no striking effects. Cultural similarity,which shows a strong influence on the diffusion of generic educationpolicies, has no robust influence in the case of ABE. On the other hand,exposure through colonial ties and operationalized in two different wayssignificantly increases the risk of policy adoption. That is, however, asign of imperial diffusion of the USSR imposing upskilling policies onits satellite states.Lastly, one can discern possible free-rider effects in that exposure inthe trade network tends to decrease the adoption risk more strongly forcountries that have a low number of formally uneducated adults thanit does for countries with a large percentage of adults without formalschooling. Nevertheless, the effect is small and weak.In a nutshell, all the results lead me to believe in a diffusion processthat might not be fully erratic but is also not structured through inter-dependencies between countries. With these results in mind, it is worthconsidering neo-institutionalist accounts (e.g., Meyer et al. 1997) whichpredicted these results. Policies travel around the world and get moreand more dispersed. I believe that ABE policies get adopted because of“taken-for-granted” knowledge of their usefulness and necessity, ratherthan via any diffusion mechanism that is discernable on this macro-level.Nevertheless, what has not been considered is the decidedly strongdiscursive power of IOs on topics like ABE, lifelong learning, and educa-tion systems in general. As “rational others” (Meyer et al. 1997, 156), IOs4 The Global Diffusion of Adult Basic Education 103have the opportunity to influence countries either directly or indirectlyto adopt policies. This assumption does not claim that IO influence is perse harmful or actually forces countries to adopt policies they otherwisewould despise; it just confirms that more research needs to be done onhow IOs maneuver, change, and influence the macro-structure of a worldsociety. Additionally, it might be worthwhile to focus on ABE as a labormarket policy and operationalize trade asymmetries and real competitionbetween countries.AppendixSee Fig. 4.5 and Tables 4.2, 4.3.Fig. 4.5 Google Ngram for “adult education” and “lifelong learning”104 F.

Polte et al.the population were, globally, not the norm during most of the twen-tieth century. State-run or sponsored hospitals go back a long time, butmeaningful healthcare systems only started to emerge at the end of thenineteenth century, together with old age pension systems and often inconjunction with work injury protection (Schmitt et al. 2015). Today,there are only a few countries left without at least a rudimentary health-care system. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean that access to necessaryhealthcare services is available to everyone. Often, medical services areinadequate and do not meet the needs of the population.A healthcare system, therefore, is more than the existence of a certainnumber of hospitals or medical doctors. In line with the establishedliterature, we understand healthcare systems as the sum of all formalarrangements concerning the financing, regulation and provision of qual-ified health services within a society dealing specifically with healthcare asan area of social protection (Roemer 1991; Freeman and Frisina 2010;Rothgang 2021). Here, we are only interested in systems in which thestate is substantially involved in at least one of the aforementioneddimensions of healthcare. We call this a healthcare system under publicresponsibility. Such a system is introduced when (a) the first nationwidelegislation is passed, (b) entitlements to healthcare benefits are securedby law, and (c) the elements of the healthcare system are integrated(de Carvalho and Fischer 2020). Today, based on this comparativelydemanding definition, we find healthcare systems that establish entitle-ments to healthcare for increasingly larger parts of their population inthe vast majority of countries (Fig. 5.1).A.

Was it a logicalconsequence of industrial development and/or increasing wealth? Didhealthcare systems develop as a result of democratization, or was it aslow diffusion process whereby states copied the policy innovation fromtheir neighbors?In what follows, we start with a literature review on theories that mightexplain the introduction of healthcare systems. The explanatory modelwe use in the modeling is informed by these theories as well as by thegeneral framework of diffusion theory as laid out in the introductorychapter of this book. After presenting the results of the statistical anal-ysis we then review the theory and draw some conclusions on how theintroduction of healthcare systems can be explained.114 A. Polte et al.Theoretical Background: Factors Influencingthe Introduction of Healthcare SystemsAlthough scholarship on the emergence of healthcare systems is oftenlimited to descriptive case studies, lacking large-scale comparisons andgenerally neglecting countries of the Global South,2 there does exist anextensive body of literature dealing with the introduction and reformsof social policies. This section reviews this literature to layout possibleexplanations for the emergence of healthcare systems. In doing so, wedistinguish between domestic factors on the one hand and horizontal aswell as vertical interdependencies on the other.Domestic FactorsThe emergence of public protection against the major risks of sickness aswell as old age, work accidents, or unemployment have been explainedas a result of modernization processes related to industrialization andurbanization (e.g., Wilensky 1974). The claim of the modernizationhypothesis is that these developments have damaged traditional meansof social protection, but the resulting economic growth provided theresources to establish public social protection programs, including healthinsurance as one of the major schemes. In particular, for larger samplesof countries at varying stages of economic development, per-capita GDP,or other indicators for the level of industrialization have been found tocorrespond with earlier adoption of social protection schemes (Collierand Messick 1975; Usui 1994). The level of industrialization has beenfound to increase the likelihood of introducing health insurance among43 African nations (Kangas 2012). In a study of 177 territories and inde-pendent states over the period 1820–2013, Schmitt et al. (2015) identifya positive effect of GDP on the adoption of health insurance. However,the effect disappears if the sample is reduced to independent states. Bycontrast, Cutler and Johnson (2004), who study a smaller sample of 202 Following de Carvalho et al. (2021) we operationalize the “Global South” as all low to uppermiddle-income countries according to the World Bank (2019) classification.5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 115OECD and Latin American countries, find evidence that higher levelsof GDP per capita slow down the implementation of national healthinsurance defined as compulsory coverage for a broad class of people.Modernization processes also apply to the medical system. By thesecond half of the nineteenth century, medical progress helped to estab-lish public health and sanitation measures to control epidemics of infec-tious or parasitic diseases (Trein 2018). The colonial powers disseminatedEuropean medical knowledge globally and, in the inter-war period, alsobegan to promote the education of local medical professions, albeit stillfocusing on disease control and mother and child health (Bruchhausen2020). Since the 1930s more sophisticated medical interventions haveevolved, enabling the development of effective cures for many diseases(OECD 1987). Health-specific problem pressure, as manifested by recur-rent epidemics or indicators of population health status, stimulate publichealthcare policies. In particular, as therapies become more sophisticatedand expensive, regulation of access and third-party financing are required(Moran 2000). Both health-specific problem pressure and disseminationof medical knowledge, as represented for example by the foundationof medical schools, may pave the way for the formation of a publichealthcare system. These two correlations can be reformulated as a capa-bilities hypothesis—countries with more advanced medical infrastructureand knowledge may introduce healthcare systems earlier—and a problempressure hypothesis—medical needs may speed up the development of ahealthcare system.Conflict and power resource theories have highlighted the role ofdemocratic representation and the power of left-wing parties and unionsin the emergence and evolution of welfare states (Korpi 1983). Based ona sample of 76 nations, Cutright (1965) finds that, on a similar level ofeconomic development, nations with more representative governmentsintroduce social security programs earlier. At the same time, studies high-light the role of monarchies or autocratic governments as early adoptersof social policy (Flora and Alber 1981; Mares and Carnes 2009). Earlyimplementation of social policy is explained as a means to appeaseand control workers, to acquire output legitimacy, and stabilize regimeswith weak or without democratic legitimacy. Apart from the politicalregime type, institutional characteristics of political systems contribute116 A. Polte et al.to the explanation of timing and expansion of social policies. Blake andAdolino’s (2001) analysis of 20 advanced economies suggest that feder-alism and a fragmented executive slow down the introduction of nationalhealth insurance. Immergut’s (1992) comparative case study of healthpolicy implementation in France, Sweden, and Switzerland shows thatthe numbers of veto points in the legislative process provide opportuni-ties for opponents of healthcare reforms to block legislation seeking toimplement or expand public health insurance. The literature pertainingto the regime type hypothesis is thus undecided whether democracies orautocracies are more likely to create healthcare systems.InterdependenciesOver the past few decades, new strands of research have emerged toaddress the limitations of classical comparative social policy studies,which have not been fully able to systematically capture the transnationalcontext and interventions that may impact social policies (Deacon 2007;Yeates 2008). Nowadays, social policies in every country face similarchallenges that may require solutions beyond the nation-state level (e.g.,demographic changes, growing inequality, global socioeconomic crises).The global social policy literature and the international interdependen-cies framework seek to address this shortcoming by accounting for thetransnational contexts within which social policymaking is developed(Deacon 2007; Kaasch 2012; Obinger et al. 2013). They emphasize therole of international organizations (IOs) in shaping social policies, espe-cially for the countries of the Global South where the possibilities forboth financial and technical resource mobilization are frequently limitedor non-existent. Relating to the healthcare field, the literature showshow IOs can be influential for the adoption, reform, and maintenanceof healthcare policies (see e.g., Walt and Gilson 1994; Marmor et al.2009). These organizations operate as (a) financing agents through loansand aid, (b) champions of regulation and rights, (c) sources of ideas andnormative standards, (d) facilitators of policy exchange, and (e) dissemi-nators of models and prescriptions (Kaasch 2013). Since the introductionof the first healthcare system in 1883 in Germany, IOs have always5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 117been involved in the field, notably the Pan American Health Organi-zation (PAHO), the Office International d’Hygiène Publique (OIHP),the League of Nations Health Organization (LNHO), and the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) in the early period, and the WHO andthe World Bank more recently. In what we call the IO hypothesis, we thusassume that the likelihood of implementing a healthcare system increasesor accelerates with the creation of policy field-specific IOs.The most substantial and influential way in which IOs operate withinthe healthcare field is through loans and/or aid, either by means of directtransfers and interventions or via the support of recipient countries’domestic policies and institutions (Addison et al. 2015). The literatureshows that often the disbursement of loans is tied to conditions alignedwith the donors’ agenda, which has a massive impact on domestic socialpolicies (Babb and Carruthers 2008; Clements et al. 2013; Kaasch 2013).Although there is considerable scholarly work on aid and healthcare,this is mainly limited to the last 30 years (see e.g., McCoy et al. 2009;Dodd and Lane 2010), when aid in all its forms exponentially increased:For instance, from 1990 to 2016, aid from donors provided morethan US$531 billion to economies of the Global South for financinghealthcare (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) 2017).Existing scholarship, therefore, mainly focuses on how aid shapes and/orinfluences preexisting systems, but does not address whether aid affectsthe emergence of healthcare arrangements. In order to fill this gap, weexamine the development assistance hypothesis, assuming that the like-lihood of a country introducing a healthcare system increases as aidgrows.Another recent strand that attempts to explain the introductionand expansion of social policies is the warfare and welfare hypoth-esis concerning the linkages between war and the welfare state. Thisrelationship was already studied in the 1950s (Titmuss 1958); morerecently, Obinger et al. (2018) have addressed this in a global perspective.According to this strand of theory, military conflicts and war experi-ences are a driving force behind changes in the welfare state. Demandsfor redistribution and risk-pooling that emerged in the aftermath of theSecond World War and resulted in access expansion to social securityin Europe are a classic illustration of the warfare and welfare hypothesis118 A. Polte et al.(Dryzek and Goodin 1986; Obinger et al. 2018). Obinger and Schmitt(2018, 2020) argue that war enhances state capacity, encourages socialprotection demands, and increases social spending. The expansion ofthe state is interpreted as a consequence of wars. It strengthens the legalsystem and the assertiveness of jurisdiction and has the capacity to bolsterdemocratization. The horrors of military conflicts heighten demands forsocial protection in order to provide income, employment, education,and housing for invalids, war victims, and their dependents. Lastly, warsimpact social spending levels via newly created social protection schemesand the introduction of income and inheritance taxation. Even thoughcase studies and, to a lesser extent, comparative work on the linkagesbetween social policies implementation and wars are abundant for richercountries (Kasza 2002; Ferrera 2018; Lloyd and Battin 2018; Obingerand Schmitt 2020), this relationship has not been fully examined innon-Western countries.Finally, we assume that diffusion patterns that have been observedin other areas of social policy (Kangas 2012; Schmitt et al. 2015) mayalso influence the political decision to establish a healthcare system. Thismight be policy learning among neighboring states or between statesamong which strong relationships of political exchange exist. One inter-dependency that has not yet been addressed sufficiently in comparativewelfare state research, but which is prominent in studies on transnationalpolitical networks (Maoz 2011) is trade relations. Following the theoret-ical reasoning in this book (see Mossig et al. 2021, in this volume), wetherefore also assume that cultural ties, colonial ties, geographic prox-imity, and the network of trade relations may influence the introductionof a healthcare system.We assume that these four networks may build theunderlying structure for the policy diffusion process in general and forthe diffusion of the idea of creating a healthcare system in particular. Thenetworks can be seen as avenues or channels through which communica-tion and information about social policies can travel. Under the headingof the network hypothesis we seek to test whether countries are more likelyto introduce healthcare systems if they are closely connected through oneor more of these networks to other countries that have already establisheda healthcare system.5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 119Modeling the Introduction of HealthcareSystemsAs previously mentioned, we are interested in determining at what pointin time a government takes responsibility for healthcare, and we definehealthcare system introduction as (a) passing the first nationwide legis-lation, (b) legally establishing entitlements to healthcare benefits, and(c) integrating the elements of the healthcare system.3 For our anal-ysis we utilize the R package netdiffuseR (Vega Yon and Valente 2021)to model the adoption of healthcare systems over time (Valente 1995).In order to operationalize the dependent variable we created a datasetcontaining the de jure introduction dates for all countries with morethan 500,000 inhabitants in 2017, taking into account the first nation-wide legislation that defines the population group receiving benefits andan institution or a set of institutions responsible for healthcare. In orderto test the eight hypotheses lined out in the theory section above wethen have to operationalize the respective independent variables, onceagain distinguishing between domestic factors and interdependencies.This description is followed by a short section on data preparation.Domestic FactorsTo address the assumption of the modernization hypothesis that thecreation of a healthcare system may be easier for wealthy countries andthat therefore countries with a higher GDP per capita may introduce ahealthcare system earlier than poorer countries, we include data on GDPper capita as introduced in Chapter 1 to measure a country’s wealth. Forthe analysis we convert the values to units of US$10,000.Another variable to capture domestic institutional developments thatmay precede the creation of healthcare systems and can serve as a measurefor the capabilities hypothesis is data on founding years of medical schools.The binary variable indicates whether a country has an operational3 An in-depth description of our conceptualization and operationalization can be found in deCarvalho and Fischer (2020).120 A. Polte et al.medical school (“1”) or not (“0”). The data is based on the “World Direc-tory of Medical Schools” (www.wdoms.org). We see this as a proxy forhigher levels of medical knowledge.While the introduction of healthcare systems may depend on the avail-ability of resources and financial capability, it may also be a response tourgent healthcare needs. In line with the problem pressure hypothesis weassume that a higher problem pressure may induce countries to introducea healthcare system earlier than their counterparts with a lesser burden ofdisease. In the model we use two indicators to measure problem pressureor burden of disease, namely, life expectancy and child mortality . Neitherindicator is ideal because they only reflect the effect of poor health onmortality in general and on mortality of one, especially vulnerable popu-lation group. But these indicators are the only alternatives available withreasonable accuracy for the whole historical period under observation.Both indicators were obtained from the Gapminder project (Gapminder2017). Life expectancy is measured as the average number of years anewborn child is expected to live if current mortality patterns were tostay the same.4 Child mortality describes the number of children whichdie below the age of five years per 1000 children born alive.5In line with the other chapters in this book and to address the regimetype hypothesis, we include as a measure of regime type the level of democ-ratization in our analysis. As introduced in Chapter 1, the index rangesfrom low levels of democracy (closed autocracy = 0) to high levels ofdemocracy (liberal democracy = 9).InterdependenciesIn order to address the IO hypothesis and the development aid hypothesiswe also include three variables that capture the health-related institu-tional landscape before system introduction. These are the role of theWorld Health Organization and its regional organizations, the avail-ability of medical education and research facilities, and the sum of4 Source link: https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd004/.5 Source link: https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd005/.5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 121external health-related funds, namely bilateral development assistance forhealth (DAH). The inclusion of these variables reflects the possibilitythat being actively involved in international health politics may speed upthe introduction of domestic healthcare systems. We include a binaryvariable with a default value of “0,” which is set to “1” for a periodof 10 years around a country’s involvement in the foundation of fourearly international health organizations; the Pan American Health Orga-nization (PAHO) in 1902, the Office international d’hygiène publique(OIHP) in 1907, the League of Nations Health Organization (LNHO)in 1920, and finally the foundation of the World Health Organiza-tion (WHO) in 1948. Because the foundation of these institutionswas preceded by multilateral negotiation, our international organizationsvariable becomes active for the countries involved in the negotiationsalready one year before the official founding dates (t − 1).The Development Assistance for Health indicator is defined by the sumof values of all DAH commitments in constant 2011 US$ receivedfrom international donors in a given year. All data points were obtainedfrom the “AidData Core Research Release, v3.1”6 data set (Tierney et al.2011). Incoming dyadic project level commitment amounts have beentransformed to yearly country-level aggregates.The motivation for our decision to include a variable that measures inwhich years a country was involved in wars lies on the one hand in theargument that wars will likely increase the healthcare needs of affectedpopulations. Involvement in wars can thus be interpreted as anothermeasure of problem pressure . On the other hand, the inclusion of a vari-able that measures involvement in wars also addresses the recent claim ofthe welfare and warfare hypothesis that the military played an active rolein advancing social policies in general and health services in particularto secure healthier and fitter recruits (Obinger 2020). In this study, weinclude war as a binary variable, which is coded “1” for countries thatare affected by war in a given year and “0” for those who are not. Since6 Source link: https://www.aiddata.org/data/aiddata-core-research-release-level-1-3-1.122 A. Polte et al.we expect that wars increase the problem pressure only after a certaintime, we decided to lag the start of the war effect by one year (t + 1).The end of a war is lagged by two years (t + 2), because it is unlikelythat war-induced healthcare needs of the population immediately ceaseto exist with the end of the conflict. The war effect used in our modelaccounts for both intra-state wars as well as inter-state wars as definedby the “Correlates of War” project (Sarkees and Wayman 2010), fromwhich the original data was obtained.The operationalization of the networks is described in detail inChapter 1. The proximity network measures the inverse of the distancesbetween countries’ capitals, the trade network measures the volume oftrade between country pairs. The network of cultural proximity resultsfrom clustering similarities in religion, gender relations, civil liberties,rule of law, government ideology, language, and colonial relations. Andthe colonial network represents ties between colonizers and colonies.Data PreparationFollowing Aiken and West (1991), we centered several continuous vari-ables of our models to facilitate a more straightforward and meaningfulinterpretation of the estimated coefficients. We did so by subtracting thegrand mean from every value, so that variable values equal to the meanvalue of the sample in the respective year are exactly at “0” after thisprocedure. While centering may help us to better interpret the results ofour model, it does not affect the overall meaning of the model or its effectsizes, because the variable values are merely proportionally shifted (Aikenand West 1991). The following continuous variables are centered: lifeexpectancy in years, child mortality per 1000 born, development assis-tance for health, GDP, and regime type. As proposed in the introductorychapter, we also addressed the issue with non-independent observationsby using cluster-robust standard errors (Zeileis et al. 2020).5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 123FindingsTable 5.1 presents the log hazard rates for our models of introductionof healthcare systems.

Polte et al.contains the complete set of variables, in Model 2 we added interac-tion effects between process-time control variables and GDP per capita,network exposure by geographic proximity, and the trade network.7We defined four time periods as intervals for the piecewise constantstep function for our discrete time logistic hazard models. The first periodcovers the years from 1880, the start of our observation period, until1913, the last year before the beginning of the First World War. Thesecond period from 1914 is historically shaped by the societal andpolitical interruptions of two world wars, and ends in the year of thecapitulation of the axis powers in 1945. Starting in the aftermath ofSecond World War and the beginning of the Cold War, the third periodfrom 1946 until 1978 is characterized by the bloc conflict between thetwo superpowers USA and USSR, and their two competing ideologies,and it is at the same time a period in which much of the current system ofinternational organizations was created—a period of increasing economicglobalization (Su 2002), and decolonization (Betts 2004). The final timeperiod covers the more recent past and extends from 1979 until the endof our observation period 2010. It is shaped by the rise of globalization,the rise and climax of neoliberalism, the collapse of the socialist blocin the 1990s and the “so-called golden age of development assistancefor health” (Dieleman et al. 2017) in the first decade of the twenty-firstcentury.Among our explanatory variables, Model 1 identifies significant effectsonly for child mortality, regime type, and proximity. The negative corre-lation for the regime-type variable indicates that non-democratic statesare likely to introduce healthcare systems at an earlier point in timethan democratic states. Concerning the regime type hypothesis, our find-ings therefore support the strand of literature which highlight the role ofautocratic regimes in the emergence of social policies. Here, it has to beconsidered that the early healthcare systems often cover groups pivotalto maintaining political power such as the military, state employees, or7 The exposure in networks of trade and geographic proximity have been centered by the grandmean like the “GDP per Capita” variable.5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 125workers in the manufacturing industries. Plausible motives for the intro-duction of social policies under autocratic regimes include the forging ofloyalty, striving for output legitimacy, and the appeasement of workersand socialist movements. Moreover, in autocratic regimes there tend tobe less veto points to consider in the legislative process, which reducesthe chances of bills granting entitlements to healthcare being blocked orrejected.A positive statistically significant correlation with the proximity vari-able shows that the introduction of healthcare systems followed regionalpatterns with mostly European countries among the early adopters,many South American countries following in the second time period, alarge number of Asian and North African countries introducing health-care systems in the third time period. Among the 28 countries thatintroduced healthcare systems after 1978 only three were not in Africa.The effect for child mortality is negative, indicating that countrieswith lower child mortality rates were more likely to introduce healthcaresystems earlier than countries with higher child mortality rates. Contraryto the assumption of the problem pressure hypothesis that higher problempressure may drive the introduction of healthcare systems, the negativesign of the child mortality variable suggests that it is rather countrieswith better infant health which are more likely to introduce healthcaresystems earlier. Since child mortality is often caused by poverty-relatedillnesses (Black et al. 2010), improved infant health may thus rather beseen as an indicator for better social conditions that usually accompanyhigher GDP. However, the model does not show a statistically signifi-cant correlation between levels of GDP per capita and the introductionof a healthcare system. This finding seems to contradict the existingknowledge of healthcare system emergence (Schmitt et al. 2015).Model 2 offers an explanation for the puzzling GDP result. There,we have added interaction effects that capture the time dependence ofseveral of our independent and network exposure variables. The intro-duction of the interaction effects with time periods implies that foreach variable the main effect and the interaction effect must be addedup to get the overall effect of the independent variable in the respec-tive period. Including these interaction effects significantly improves the126 A. Polte et al.overall model fit and explained variance. By adding interaction terms forGDP and the last three time periods, the main GDP effect which nowrepresents the log hazard rate of GDP per capita in the first time periodbecomes positive and significant. We thus see a correlation between GDPper capita and the likelihood of a healthcare system being introducedin the first time period (1880–1913). Hence, early adopters were morelikely to be found among rich countries than among poor ones. Inthe earliest period of observation, mostly comparatively affluent Euro-pean states such as Germany, Austria-Hungary, Norway, Russia, andLuxemburg, or Uruguay and Cuba in South America, introduced healthsystems. In the remaining time periods healthcare systems were intro-duced in countries with GDP per-capita levels above and below theaverage. Seemingly, other factors like nation-building in former coloniesgain more importance while the wealth of a nation loses its predictivepower. The model therefore does not support a general moderniza-tion hypothesis. Only for the pioneering states did higher levels ofeconomic development strongly correlate with earlier healthcare systemintroduction.Looking at the other interaction effects the model shows signifi-cant correlations between adoption and geographical proximity with adeclining magnitude over time. This indicates that regional patternsstructure the introduction of healthcare systems, but the importanceof proximity to states that have already introduced a healthcare systemdecreases over time. This reflects on the one hand a saturation processin which the importance of proximity naturally declines with growingcumulative adoption. On the other hand, it also reflects that earlyadopters were already widely distributed over the globe and can be foundin Europe, South America, Asia, and Oceania.When looking at trade flows, we see a negative significant correlationfor the baseline effect for the first period and positive and significantinteraction effects between trade flows and process time compared to thefirst time period. This indicates that for early adopters, trade relationswere clearly not a diffusion channel for healthcare system introduction.Compared to the first period, the negative effect of trade relations seemsto be damped in later years, with the result that the overall effect is not5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 127stable. The negative and insignificant trade exposure coefficient in Model1, which accounts for the complete time period, also suggests no clearcorrelation.The two other network effects—cultural similarity and colonial ties—are not significant, which means that from the networks included inour models only geographical proximity seems to be a candidate forexplaining the introduction of healthcare systems for all time periodsand for all countries of the world. As Table 5.2 in the appendix shows, analternative, non-normalized operationalization of colonial network expo-sure does not substantially alter these results. Of course, this does notpreclude the possibility that they were highly important for specific cases.None of the other variables show statistically significant effects ineither of the two models. Nor do they become significant when control-ling for the possibility that they may only affect the hazard rate ofhealth system introduction in specific time periods. Being part of oneof the groups of countries that founded the major health-related interna-tional organizations has not had a measurable impact on these countries’politics in terms of creating domestic healthcare systems. Some coun-tries, such as Austria, Hungary, or France, had already established healthsystems before the first international organization was founded. Some,like Cuba or Uruguay, fitted the expected pattern, and others, like theUSA, participated in all institution-building processes but only created adomestic healthcare system much later. Our models thus do not providesupport for the IO hypothesis. One reason for this may be that the roleof IOs is possibly more relevant for shaping the structure of healthcaresystems than for spurring their introduction. But this aspect is outsidethe scope of this article.The foundation of medical schools does not seem to be related tothe introduction of healthcare systems, either. Both indicators—interna-tional organizations and medical schools—may be more closely relatedto a country’s concern for public health, which does not directly translateinto the creation of a healthcare system. We thus find no support for thecapabilities hypothesis, but obviously, the existence of medical schools isonly a very rough measure of medical knowledge and capabilities in thearea of health.128 A. Polte et al.The amount of development assistance for health, for which data wasonly available for the last two time periods, also does not seem to make adifference regarding the willingness of a country to establish a healthcaresystem, nor does involvement in wars seem to translate into health-care system creation. The finding that these indicators and also the lifeexpectancy indicator remains not significant in our models, in combi-nation with the negative significant effect of child mortality, stronglysuggests that health-related problem pressure does not seem to inducecountries to introduce healthcare systems. Fighting the burden of diseaseswith public health measures does not necessarily go hand in hand withcreating entitlements for medical services.ConclusionThe first major conclusion we can draw from our analysis is that noneof the factors highlighted in the theory section is able to fully explainthe timing of healthcare system introduction worldwide. Nevertheless,we clearly see regional diffusion patterns and some domestic factorsshow significant correlation with the hazard rate of introducing health-care systems. This observation suggests that full explanations should gobeyond the realm of traditional comparative welfare state analysis andincorporate ideas from global social policy research, diffusion research,and global history.As in other instances (e.g., Rothgang and Schneider 2015) the expla-nation of change demands a complex framework that takes differentstrands of theory on board and combines domestic factors and inter-national interdependencies.Starting our review of hypotheses on domestic factors , our modelsclearly reject a strict modernization hypothesis that assumes a universalcorrelation between economic development and wealth on the one handand the creation of healthcare systems on the other. We rather come upwith a highly interesting result: The hypothesis holds for our first periodof observation, i.e., for the introduction of healthcare systems before5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 129First World War. In this period the introduction of a health system wasmore likely in more affluent countries, thus confirming modernizationtheory. In subsequent periods, however, other factors like nation-buildingin former colonies have gained importance, leading to a decline in theinfluence of wealth on the introduction of healthcare systems.Turning to the capabilities hypothesis, we find no evidence to supportit. The absence of a statistical correlation in our model may, however,reflect the relatively crude operationalization of this hypothesis due to alack of better data for the whole period.The negative correlation between child mortality seems to stronglyrefute the problem pressure hypothesi s and suggests that problem pressurerather decreases the likelihood of earlier healthcare system introduction.This interpretation is, however, misleading. Based on reports from severalcase studies we rather assume that typically, public health measures in thearea of hygiene, water supply, etc., precede the introduction of a health-care system. Only after such public health measures have brought on adecline in (child) mortality figures, states introduce healthcare systemsunder conditions of already lower problem pressure.The literature on the effects of regime types already suggests that insome instances autocracy increases the likelihood of healthcare systemsbeing introduced. Our findings support the observation that healthcaresystems often predate democracy. While democratic representation isnot a necessary condition for the introduction of a healthcare system,the likely motives of non-democratic regimes for implementing socialprotection suggest that these policies are not independent of democ-ratization processes, as they seek to stifle the growth of democraticmovements.According to the IO hypothesis we should see a jump in the numberof healthcare systems being introduced after the WHO or its precedinghealth-related international organizations were founded. Figure 5.2shows that this is not the case. Healthcare systems are introduced at arelatively constant rate over time, with small peaks especially in yearsin which empires like the Austro-Hungarian empire (in 1888) or theRussian empire (in 1912) introduced systems. Correspondingly, thediffusion models show no significant effect of the foundation of IOs.130 A. Polte et al.Fig. 5.2 Introduction of healthcare systems over timeOur analysis does not support the warfare and welfare hypothesis atall. While the literature has shown that wars have accelerated and evendriven social policy developments in some countries, they do not seemto be drivers of healthcare system introduction, globally and over time.Finally, we find mixed support for the network hypothesi s. Tradenetworks cannot explain policy diffusion. While gaining some impor-tance over time they do not seem to represent relevant channels ofpolicy diffusion regarding healthcare systems. Nor do the links createdthrough cultural similarity and colonial ties offer a universal explanationof healthcare system introduction. But the introduction of health-care systems clearly followed a regional pattern with European coun-tries coming first, and (South-)American, Asian, and African countriesfollowing roughly in this order. Whether this result reflects actual policylearning or follows mainly other logics, e.g., the timing of decoloniza-tion and nation-building, needs to be assessed with other methods. Basedon our knowledge of healthcare systems around the world, we actuallyassume that it is more likely the type than the timing of the systemintroduction that is influenced through transnational policy diffusionnetworks.5 The Emergence of Healthcare Systems 131While our results shed some light on possible factors influencing theemergence of healthcare systems worldwide, our analysis clearly has itslimitations. Our model can only explain about 21% of the variance inthe data. Clearly, other factors not included in our model and case-specific idiosyncrasies play an important role in the decision of a countryto create a healthcare system. The long time frame also severely limits thepossibility to operationalize some of our hypotheses, as data on many ofthe—theoretically interesting—variables is unavailable for most of thecountries prior to the 1980s. This is especially true for more qualitativedata, e.g., on the strength of progressive political actors, which mighthave enabled us to operationalize the otherwise promising power resourcetheory. Data on networks other than the four most basic networksincluded in our model is especially hard to come by. Therefore, it wasnot possible to test policy-specific relational aspects.Nevertheless, our modeling for the first time systematically tests manyof the assumptions present in the social policy literature which usuallylooks at individual countries or smaller samples of countries mostly fromthe OECD world. It shows that so far, no universal model of healthcaresystem introduction emerges from these assumptions. In the other hand,it highlights regional diffusion and the time-dependent relevance thatsome of the factors we have identified nevertheless have in a global socialpolicy perspective.AppendixSee Table 5.2.132 A.

From a welfare policy perspective, it is also1This chapter is a product of the research conducted in the Collaborative Research Center“Global Dynamics of Social Policy” at the University of Bremen.

Fischer et al.a period in which particular social risks are likely to occur that calls formitigation through state intervention. One such risk is long-term care(LTC) dependency, that is, enduring physical and/or mental impairmentsnecessitating assistance with daily living activities.2 Unlike acute illness orloss of income in old age, LTC is a so-called “latecomer” of welfare policywhich was historically—and in many parts of the world still is—notaddressed as a (separate) social policy field (Österle and Rothgang 2010;Ranci and Pavolini 2015; Scheil-Adlung 2015). Nevertheless, we can seethat over the past three decades in particular, debates, policy proposals,and reforms dealing with social protection for LTC dependency havepicked up in many states as well as in international and transnationalexchange. For instance, specific social LTC insurance schemes have beenestablished in countries such as Israel, Germany, Luxembourg, Japan,and South Korea (Schmidt 2005; Companje 2014, 102; Maags 2020).In Latin America, Uruguay recently introduced a National System ofCare, and similar proposals are being discussed elsewhere in the region(Matus-Lopez and Cid Pedraza 2016; Esquivel 2017). Meanwhile, LTCis also increasingly addressed on the international level, for example indifferent forums and entities of the United Nations (UN) (SecondWorldAssembly on Ageing 2002; WHO 2015, 2017).In the present chapter, we aim to investigate what factors—interna-tional as well as domestic—have so far contributed to the introduction ofLTC systems under public responsibility for the elderly worldwide. That is,our explanandum is the point in time at which states first adopted statu-tory entitlements concerning social protection for LTC for (at least) theold-age population. To this end, we employ data on introduction pointstaken from the novel Historical Long-Term Care Systems Dataset (Fischerand Sternkopf 2021). In the next section, based on theoretical consid-erations borrowed from welfare state research and literature focusing onLTC policy, we specify several hypotheses on the role of horizontal andvertical diffusion channels and countries’ national constellations in the2 In general, care dependency can occur at any age, e.g. due to a disability causing loss offunctional capacity. However, there is a strong (statistical) association between age and LTCdependency, making old age the period of life with the highest risk of needing LTC (WHO2015; Colombo et al. 2011).6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 141introduction of LTC systems. Subsequently, we outline the operational-ization of our dependent and independent variables. We then move on toconduct the empirical analysis using a discrete-time logistic hazard model ,presenting the method, results, and limitations. In the final part, wediscuss the findings and conclude.Theory and HypothesesGenerally, there is a lack of (cross-country) explanatory analysis onthe introduction of social protection schemes for LTC which makes itdifficult to build on previous theoretical specifications and results forformulating hypotheses. However, some insights for explaining the intro-duction of LTC systems can be drawn from assumptions and observa-tions in publications on LTC in general and in particular from the bodyof (case) studies exploring LTC policy reform and design (e.g., Camp-bell et al. 2009; Theobald and Kern 2011; Esquivel 2017). Furthermore,the theory strands used to analyze welfare policies in general (see e.g.,Schmitt et al. 2015) seem to be a fruitful starting point for theorizingabout the policy field of LTC (cf. Leitner 2013, 51–52). Consequently,we use these existing bodies of literature to structure and underpin oursubsequent theoretical discussion. In line with the focus of this editedvolume, we start with interdependencies and then move on to identifyrelevant domestic factors.International InterdependenciesMoving beyond “methodological nationalism,” the study of policy diffu-sion and policy transfer (see e.g., Marsh and Sharman 2009; Obingeret al. 2013) has highlighted the relevance of transnational and inter-national interdependencies for countries’ (social) policy decisions. Theconcept of diffusion assumes “contagion” between different entities.Consequently, in comparative policy research, diffusion describes aprocess “in which policies in one unit are influenced by concepts,proposals, policies or ideas from another unit” and can occur in different142 J. Fischer et al.constellations: horizontally from country to country, vertically frominternational organization (IO)3 to country or vice versa, or in the formof imperial diffusion (Kuhlmann et al. 2020, 82, 85). As regards thediffusion of LTC system introduction, diffusion both between countriesand from IOs to countries seems plausible. In the following, we outlineboth.As described in the introductory chapter (Mossig et al., in thisvolume), multiple types of ties may drive diffusion of social policiesbetween countries: geographical, cultural, and economic proximity andcolonial ties (cf. Elkins and Simmons 2005; Schmitt and Obinger 2013).So which “contagion channels” do we expect to play a role for the hori-zontal diffusion of LTC systems in particular? While “macro” diffusionpatterns of LTC schemes have not been analyzed so far, there are studieson the role of LTC policy transfer in a small number of European andEast Asian countries that provide clues on relevant ties. This body ofliterature points to the role of relationships established through similarwelfare state institutions (Maags 2020, 13; Campbell et al. 2009) aswell as “geographical and cultural proximity” (Theobald and Kern 2011,334). In general, it seems plausible that spatial proximity fosters thespread of ideas on establishing social protection for LTC dependency.From LTC research, at least two groups of geographically close coun-tries with similar LTC models and evidence of international exchanges onthe topic come to mind: the Scandinavian countries with their universalpublic service model (Sipilä et al. 2000), and the spread of social LTCinsurance in East Asia (Maags 2020). Therefore, it may also be thecase that countries learn from a geographically close “reference group”(Elkins and Simmons 2005, 45) with regard to the introduction of anLTC system, which leads us to investigate the following hypothesis: Closegeographical proximity to countries with an established LTC system increasesthe likelihood of introduction of LTC systems (H1a, geographic diffusionhypothesis).Furthermore, we assume that cultural similarity is especially interestingin the policy field of LTC (cf. Pfau-Effinger 2019, 222). For instance,3 We use the term ‘international organization” in a broad sense, subsuming both global as wellas regional associations of states and including supranational organizations such as the EuropeanUnion.6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 143in their analysis of LTC policy transfer in several European countries,Theobald and Kern (2011, 334) point to the shared cultural and histor-ical heritage of Austria, the Czech Republic, and the Italian region ofSouth Tyrol, arguing that this may be one of the reasons why the lattertwo have oriented themselves to the Austrian LTC system. A particularaspect of culture that seems to be relevant with regard to the field of LTCis family values, that is, “cultural values and notions with respect to thestructure of the family and the gender division of labour” (Pfau-Effinger2005, 328). For instance, shared norms about the role of informal careprovision by women could foster countries’ exchange on the need forand form of social protection for LTC. We test the relevance of sharedcultural norms with the following hypothesis: Close cultural similarity tocountries with an established LTC system increases the likelihood of diffusionof LTC systems (H1b, cultural diffusion hypothesis).LTC is a comparably recent field of social policy which has devel-oped mostly since the dissolution of colonial empires. Moreover, atthe time of publication relatively few LTC schemes have been intro-duced in the Global South (see Fig. 6.2), which suggests that there isno strong theoretical correlation between the direct role of colonial tiesand the establishment of LTC systems. However, shared colonial heritagehas facilitated the development of similar national (welfare) institutions(Schmitt 2015), which, in turn, could encourage later exchanges onfinding a fitting “policy solution” for LTC. For example, there is evidencethat countries with preexisting social insurance models such as Japanor South Korea sought advice from countries with similar institutionsand experiences for modeling their LTC systems (Campbell et al. 2009;Maags 2020). For this reason, we explore the relevance of colonial tiesas a third channel for horizontal policy diffusion: Colonial relations withcountries with an established LTC system increases the likelihood of diffusionof LTC systems (H1c, colonial diffusion hypothesis).Aging and LTC are not only discussed in and among countries, butalso by IOs. Organizations such as the European Union (EU), the Orga-nization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), theWorld Bank or the World Health Organization (WHO) address theseissues through recommendations, comparative studies, or monitoringsystems. While the topic has recently also gained importance among144 J. Fischer et al.globally active IOs as well (see e.g., WHO 2015; UN DESA 2016),organizations of the Global North have been especially active in the fieldsince the 1990s. For instance, the OECD published its first report onthe situation of the elderly in the mid-1990s (Hennessy 1994) and hassince established a comprehensive LTC database. In the EU, which, as asupranational organization, can exercise a strong influence on its memberstates, calls for national policies on LTC in the face of an aging societycame on the agenda as early as 1993 (Pacolet et al. 1999). At the end ofthe “European Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations”in 1993, the Council of Ministers published a declaration calling onMember States to initiate regulations in the field of LTC (Council of theEuropean Union 1993). In the same year, the Commission published areport comparing health care and social protection schemes in Europeancountries (Commission of the European Communities 1993; Herveyand Vanhercke 2010). Thus, EU membership since 1993 may havebeen a channel for vertical LTC policy diffusion. Not only the currentmembers, moreover, but also applicants may have been influenced bythe EU’s agenda-setting, particularly in the 1990s, at a time when someof the Central and Eastern European countries aspired to membershipin the EU and were therefore perhaps more eager to reform their welfaresystems (Mattli and Plümper 2002; Theobald and Kern 2011). Thus, ourhypothesis on vertical diffusion is the following: (Prospective) Membershipin the European Union after 1993 increases the likelihood of introducing anLTC system (H2, EU diffusion hypothesis).National ConstellationsAs regards domestic explanatory factors, (at least) three theoreticalstrands are classically differentiated in welfare (state) studies to accountfor the emergence, change, and variation of social policies (see e.g.,Huber and Stephens 2001, 15; Pierson 1996; Schmitt et al. 2015, 510).These are functionalist or socio-economic theories that stress the relevanceof economic, technical, and societal change in driving social policy intro-duction, actor and interest-based theories that focus on the influence ofpolitical and societal groups and coalitions, and institutionalist theories6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 145which postulate the influence of existing (political) rules, structures andnorms on social policy development. In this section, we turn to thesetheoretical schools and specify four hypotheses on the role of nationalconstellations in the introduction of LTC systems.Many publications dealing with LTC in different parts of the worldframe the need for (political) activity and research in the field in terms ofgrowing problem pressure (e.g., Österle et al. 2011; Feng 2019, 291–293;Colombo et al. 2011, 62–70). Two aspects are frequently cited. On theone hand, there is a (projected) increase in care dependency prevalence4in conjunction with demographic aging of societies; on the other hand, adecrease in informal (familial) care provision due to higher female labormarket participation and more dispersed family structures is discernible.This narrative is clearly embedded in functionalist theory. Accordingly,economic and technical change leads to changing demographic and soci-etal structures which create new social issues and risks—in this case, a“care gap”—which call for mitigation from the (welfare) state (Obinger2019; Bonoli 2007). To examine whether states act in line with thismodernization logic, we formulate the following hypothesis: The higherthe prevalence of LTC dependency in a country, the higher the likelihood ofLTC system introduction (H3a, problem pressure hypothesis).Besides problem pressure, functionalist theory also stresses the impor-tance of economic resources for social policy adoption and expansion:With growing wealth, countries have more means available for welfarespending (Obinger 2019; Leitner 2013, 41). While up to now thisassumption has yielded ambiguous results for different social policies andtime periods (see e.g., Schmitt et al. 2015; Jensen 2011), it has to ourknowledge never been tested with regard to LTC specifically. We there-fore investigate whether the following hypothesis holds for LTC policy:The more economically wealthy a country is, the higher is the likelihood ofLTC system introduction (H3b, economic wealth hypothesis).With a view to the role of actors and interests, a classical explanationfor the expansion of welfare transfer programs (e.g., old-age pensions,unemployment benefits) in the Global North stresses the importance ofdifferent classes’ power resources, in particular the influence of strong4 LTC prevalence describes the share of care dependent persons within the population.146 J. Fischer et al.left-wing and social democratic parties and trade unions (Pierson 1996,150; Orloff 2005). However, this seems to be less the case for social andhealth care services (e.g., Leitner 2013; Jensen 2011; Bonoli and Reber2010). Consequently, in the policy field of LTC, it is more plausibleto consider the influence of other actors and ideologies. For instance,several case studies on LTC policy reform point to the relevance ofwomen’s organizations and movements (e.g., Peng 2005; Esquivel 2017).As (informal) care provision is feminized to a large degree (WHO 2015,130; Österle and Rothgang 2010), women in particular are likely to beinterested in relief from or support with unpaid care provision—either byremuneration and recognition of informal provision or by strengtheningthe formal LTC sector. Therefore, the extent of women’s political oppor-tunities and participation within a society stands out as a potential factorinfluencing the introduction of an LTC system. In terms of actor-basedtheories, we therefore explore the following hypothesis: The more thatwomen in a country are politically empowered, the higher is the likelihoodof LTC system introduction (H3c, women empowerment hypothesis).The configuration of political institutions and regimes can gener-ally also influence welfare policy (Pierson 1996, 152). One assumptionregarding the role of a country’s political regime type is that democraciestend to expand social policy benefits more than autocratic states becausefreedom of association and elections offer the population possibilities tosuccessfully press for social protection schemes (Haggard and Kaufman2009, 13–14). In the case of LTC, these could be groups directly affectedby (the risk of ) care dependency, but also those indirectly affected,such as family caregivers and people working in the formal care sector.Although the connection between regime type and the size of the welfarestate is not straightforward (Schmidt 2019; Schmitt et al. 2015, 511),we explore the following hypothesis: The more democratic a country is,the higher is the likelihood of LTC system introduction (H3d, regime typehypothesis).6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 147Operationalization and DataAfter the theoretical framework has been outlined above, we now turnto the empirical analysis. This section firstly outlines the dependentvariable, i.e., LTC system introduction, and, secondly, specifies theoperationalization and data sources used to measure our independentvariables.Dependent Variable: Measuring the Introductionof LTC SystemsCountry-comparative data on the recently developed, complex policyfield of LTC is scarce, in particular with a view to information on thehistorical development of LTC schemes.5 Up until very recently, therewas no data available on the emergence of LTC systems (or similarconcepts) across countries. This paper therefore uses a novel datasetgenerated in the CRC project A04 Global Developments in Health CareSystems and Long-term Care as a New Social Risk, the Historical Long-Term Care Systems Dataset (HLTCS) (Fischer and Sternkopf 2021). Thisdataset covers all countries globally with more than 500,000 inhabitantsin 2017 and contains, among others, two different measures for the exis-tence and introduction dates of LTC systems under public responsibility.Thus, on the one hand, the introduction of an LTC system (type A)can be defined (i) as the first point in time when nationwide legislationis adopted, (ii) this legislation establishes entitlements to LTC bene-fits, and (iii) the elements of the LTC system are integrated to someextent (De Carvalho and Fischer 2020, 12–15).6 On the other hand,when applying a stricter understanding, an LTC system is only defined as5 There are some exceptions, most notably: since 2004 yearly updated comparative tablespresenting a structured description of countries’ LTC schemes in the wider European areaby the Mutual Information System on Social Protection (MISSOC) and the Mutual Infor-mation System on Social Protection of the Council of Europe (MISSCEO), and a collectionof laws on LTC for ten European countries by the Social Policy and Law Shared Database(SPLASH).6 The latter point is operationalized as the existence of an institution or set of institutionsexplicitly responsible for LTC.148 J. Fischer et al.having been introduced if the former criteria are fulfilled and in addition,in acknowledgment of LTC dependency as a distinct social risk (type B),LTC is institutionally treated as a social policy field of its own. Overall,while the development of such distinct LTC systems is often regarded asa remarkable event in the social policy landscape of a country, type Bsystems are globally still extremely rare, totaling 15 in 2010 and 18 by2020 (see Fig. 6.1, dark red dotted line). By contrast, LTC systems ofthe former definition may often represent rather incipient and hiddendevelopments, but are nevertheless an important first step toward socialprotection for LTC. Therefore, in this chapter, we analyze the introduc-tion of the more widespread type A LTC systems, using as our dependentvariable the adoption year of the foundational law which introduces forthe first time statutory benefits relating to social protection for LTC for(at least) the old-age population. In the remainder of this section, webriefly describe the distribution of this variable over time, which is alsovisualized in the (cumulative) adoption graph in Fig. 6.1.As shown by the light red lines in Fig. 6.1, LTC systems started toemerge from the mid-twentieth century onwards. The first country tointroduce an LTC system was the United Kingdom with the adoption ofFig. 6.1 Adoption of LTC systems (type A and B) worldwide, until 2010 (SourceOwn representation, data taken from HLTCS [version 31.01.2020])6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 149Fig. 6.2 World map of LTC system introductions (Source Data taken from HLTCS[version 31.01.2020]; Data missing for the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain,Bangladesh, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Moldova, Morocco, Nepal,New Zealand, North Korea, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda,Zimbabwe)the National Assistance Act in 1948. In the subsequent decades, the adop-tion process was rather slow and mostly took place in Europe. The firstAsian country to introduce an LTC system was Japan in 1963, closelyfollowed by the United States in 1965 as the first on the American conti-nent (see Fig. 6.2). Introduction picked up in the 1990s, as indicatedby the steep light red dotted curve in Fig. 6.1. As many as 16 coun-tries, mostly Eastern European states some of which were newly (re-)established shortly beforehand, adopted a novel LTC system from 1991until 1998. In the 2000s, the regional diversity of countries increasedto some extent, with introductions in several Asian countries as well asin South Africa. Overall, less than a third of all countries worldwidehad introduced an LTC system by 2018, indicating that the diffusionprocess of this social policy is still at an early stage. As shown on the mapin Fig. 6.2, the majority of system introductions until today is clearlycentered on Europe.150 J. Fischer et al.Independent VariablesFollowing our theoretical framework, the independent variables can bedivided into two groups: international interdependencies (H1, H2) andnational constellations (H3). We operationalize horizontal internationalinterdependencies by calculating network exposure values (Valente 1995;2005) for three potentially relevant horizontal networks: geographicproximity (H1a), cultural similarity (H1b), and colonial legacy (H1c).Network exposure is defined by the proportion of a country’s neighborswhich already adopted an LTC system. In this regard, all countries towhich the focal state is linked via a certain network tie (e.g., coloniallegacy) count as neighbors. It is also possible to account for the weights ofnetwork ties. An in-depth explanation and discussion of network expo-sure and its calculation are provided in Chapter 1 of this volume (Mossiget al. 2021, in this volume).To operationalize vertical policy diffusion from the EU to the nationallevel (H2), we created a dataset that indicates the point in time at which acountry applied for EU membership and when it became an EU memberstate. Based on this data, we identify for each year those countries thatare members of the EU or official EU applicants. In the following, wewill refer to this country set as the extended EU group. Starting with1993, which marks the beginning of EU engagement in LTC (see theorysection), the variable is set to “1” if a country is part of the extendedEU group. For the years prior to 1993 and for non-group members it iscoded “0.”We now turn to the operationalization of our hypotheses on nationalconstellations. Measuring LTC dependency as specified in the problempressure hypothesis (H3a) is challenging, as there is no data sourceproviding information about the prevalence of LTC dependency thatcovers countries worldwide or historically. As research clearly indicatesthat LTC dependency is strongly associated with (very) old age (see e.g.,WHO 2015, 65–69; Colombo et al. 2011, 40–43), we use the share ofold-age population as a proxy measure. While statistics on the GlobalNorth indicate that LTC prevalence increases significantly at the age6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 151of 80 years and above (Colombo et al. 2011, 40–43), data for coun-tries in the Global South, where the average life expectancy is lower,indicates limitations in activities of daily living even for the “youngerelderly” (WHO 2015, 68). As a compromise, we use the share of popula-tion aged 75 years and older to operationalize LTC dependency. To do so,we employ data provided by UN DESA (2019). It includes informationabout the share of population aged 75+ years in percent at five-year inter-vals and covers the period from 1950 until 2020. To cope with missingvalues, we use linear interpolation to impute data for unobserved countryyears.For the wealth hypothesis (H3b), we use the gross domestic product(GDP) per capita in units of 10,000 US$ to operationalize countries’economic power. Since this variable is extensively described in Chapter 1(Mossig et al., in this volume), we forego redescribing the data here.To operationalize the women empowerment hypothesis (H3c) thewomen’s political empowerment index (Sundström et al. 2015) is used,which is obtained from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) dataset(Coppedge et al. 2020). The index is an aggregate of three subindices—women’s civil liberties index, women’s civil society participation index,and the women’s political participation index—and ranges from “0,”indicating a low level of political empowerment of women, to “1,” indi-cating high political empowerment. Missing values have been filled withlinearly interpolated values.Finally, for the regime type hypothesis (H3d), we use the level ofdemocratization taken from V-Dem (Lührmann et al. 2018; Coppedgeet al. 2020) and described in Chapter 1. Values range from “0”—closed autocracy—to “9”—liberal democracy—and missing data hasbeen interpolated linearly (see Mossig et al., in this volume). Now thatour measurements have been specified, we move to the presentation ofthe employed method, results, and limitations of our analysis.152 J. Fischer et al.Explaining the Introduction of LTC SystemsMethodIn line with the methodological approach followed in this volume, weuse discrete-time logistic hazard models to estimate the influence of theindependent variables on the hazard ratio of LTC system introduction(cf. Windzio 2013; Valente 1995; 2005). Due to missing data in atleast one of the independent variables, our models do not include thefollowing countries from the original country sample of this volume:Bhutan, East Timor, Fiji, Guyana, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands,Somalia, South Sudan, and Suriname. Thus, the models cover observa-tions from N = 154 countries during the time period 1945–2010. Weselected 1945 as the starting point for several reasons. Firstly, it doesnot exclude any LTC system introductions (the first is in 1948), and,secondly, data for some of our independent variables are only availablefrom the 1940s/50s onwards. Under these circumstances, we deem itreasonable to pick a historic turning point—the end ofWorldWar II—asthe starting point for our analysis.We defined two time intervals for the piece-wise constant rate functionof logistic hazard models—one period from 1945 to 1977, and one from1978 to 2010. The choice is motivated by the aim of creating intervals ofsimilar length on the one hand, and by reducing the amount of controlvariables on the other. We consider this to be a reasonable approach, sincethe total number of LTC systems introduced by the end of the observa-tion period in 2010 is still very small (n = 43) compared to the samplesize (N = 154). Countries which did not introduce an LTC system until2010 were treated as right-censored cases.To facilitate a straightforward interpretation of the model results wealso conducted certain data transformations. Firstly, the women’s polit-ical empowerment index has been converted to a percentage scale.Secondly, the variable values of “share of population 75+” and “GDPper capita” have been centered, by subtracting the grand mean fromeach. Since centering only shifts the values proportionally, the proce-dure does not affect the model results, while it may improve the models’6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 153readability (Aiken and West 1991). As proposed in the introductorychapter, we addressed the issue with non-independent observations byusing cluster-robust standard errors (Zeileis et al. 2020).ResultsTable 6.1 shows the predicted hazard ratios of LTC system introduction.While Model 1 contains the full set of independent variables introducedabove, Model 2 additionally includes an interaction term for the centeredvariables “share of population 75+” and “GDP per capita.”Of the three network diffusion variables, only network exposure bygeographical proximity shows a significant and positive effect in bothmodels. This supports the geographic diffusion hypothesis (H1a), showingthat geographic proximity promotes the diffusion of ideas and policyinnovations. On a substantial level this result reflects the large clusterof LTC systems in Europe, where the first LTC systems were developed.Table 6.1 Discrete-time logistic hazard model of LTC system introduction (N =154)Dependend variable: IntroductionYear of Long-Term Care SystemsModel 1 Model 21945–1977 0.0000*** (1.20) 0.0000*** (1.36)1978–2010 0.0000*** (1.29) 0.0000*** (1.45)Network exposure: proximity 203.80*** (1.28) 117.12*** (1.27)Network exposure: culture 0.05 (2.21) 0.10 (2.20)Network exposure: colonies 1.00 (0.46) 0.98 (0.43)Extended EU group 1.23 (0.59) 1.11 (0.59)Share of population 75+ 1.30 (0.18) 1.52* (0.17)GDP per capita 1.19 (0.22) 1.15 (0.12)Women pol. empowerment index 1.06** (0.02) 1.06** (0.02)Democratization 1.21* (0.09) 1.24* (0.08)Interaction: GDP*Pop 75+ 0.86* (0.06)Observations 9080 9080Log Likelihood −195.104 −192.451Akaike Inf.

Fischer et al.The culture diffusion hypothesis (H1b) is not supported by our modelsand must be rejected under the conditions of Model 1 and Model 2,because the coefficients are not significant. Similarly, the lack of statis-tical significance of network exposure by colonial relationships is not inline with the colonial diffusion hypothesis (H1c). While the rejection of thecolonial diffusion hypothesis is understandable as the theory section hasalready highlighted the weak connection between LTC policy and colo-nial empires, it is indeed surprising that we find no evidence for diffusionby cultural similarity in our analysis.Regarding the EU diffusion hypothesis, both models yield unexpectedresults. The effects are not statistically significant, indicating that the EUagenda-setting on LTC policy since 1993 did not influence the risk ofLTC system introduction among EU members and applicants. This isa puzzling result, as it implies that the role of the EU in the field ofLTC is less influential than in other social policy fields described in theliterature, such as pensions or gender equality (Cerami 2008; Guillénand Palier 2004; O’Connor 2005).Model 1 shows a positive but not statistically significant effect for theproblem pressure (H3a) variable “share of population 75+.” This resultindicates that countries do not generally tend to introduce LTC systemsearlier as the prevalence of LTC dependency increases, and therefore H3ais rejected by Model 1. Similarly, “GDP per capita” shows no significantcorrelation to the adoption risk in Model 1. This finding contradicts theeconomic wealth hypothesis (H3b), which assumes that economic affluenceincreases the likelihood of introducing an LTC system. To investigate thisresult further, we discuss the effects of the interaction term included inModel 2 at the end of this section.The coefficients of the women’s political empowerment index aresignificantly positive in both models. Since the variables represent theoriginal index on a percentage scale, the hazard of introducing an LTCsystem increases by 6% for each additional percent of the index. Recap-turing the 10% interval of the original index, an increase by one levelstatistically results in a 60% higher risk of LTC system introduction.Thus, the model results support the women empowerment hypothesis(H3c). Similarly, both models predict a significant positive effect of thelevel of democratization. Since the effects in both models point in the6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 155same direction, we can draw from them at least weak empirical supportfor the regime type hypothesis (H3d).In Model 2, we have added an interaction term for economic wealthand problem pressure, because we expected that the influence of problempressure could be of greater relevance if a country is comparably richand can better afford to introduce LTC benefits. Furthermore, we weresurprised by the absent statistical significance of problem pressure andeconomic wealth in Model 1. Consequently, the additional interactionhypothesis reads: The higher the economic wealth, the stronger the effectof high prevalence of LTC dependency on the risk of LTC system adoption(IH).In Model 2 the effect of “share of population 75+” increases comparedto Model 1 and becomes significant (p < 0.05). Thus, in countries ofaverage economic wealth an increase of the “share of population 75+”by one percent increases the odds for LTC system introduction by 52%.The GDP per capita coefficient, however, remains insignificant and thusindicates that economic wealth has no influence on the risk of adoptionfor countries with average problem pressure.Finally, the interaction term itself shows a significant negative coef-ficient. Figure 6.3 shows the predicted probabilities of LTC systemadoption related to the share of population aged 75 and older, while thelines represent the effect difference among countries of average (blue),low (red), and high (green) economic wealth. The latter two indicatevalues which are one standard deviation below and above the mean,respectively. As shown in Fig. 6.3, the overall positive effect of problempressure on the adoption risk is dampened as economic wealth increases.However, Fig. 6.3 also shows that this dampening effect almost onlyapplies to countries with relatively high problem pressure (1.02% aboveaverage and higher).Our interaction hypothesis therefore has to be rejected. The positiveeffect of high problem pressure on the introduction of LTC systemsdoes not increase with economic wealth. One possible explanation forthis surprising finding could be that elderly people in richer countriesmay have better opportunities to make provisions for future LTC depen-dency during their working life. They also might receive higher old-age156 J. Fischer et al.Fig. 6.3 Interaction effectspensions allowing them to pay for LTC services more easily. Conse-quently, with high problem pressure, the necessity for social protectionfor LTC (especially for the poorest population strata) could be even morepressing in less wealthy countries.LimitationsThe analysis faces several limitations. As already mentioned, LTC is arelatively nascent social policy field, and LTC dependency as a new socialrisk only recently became more salient in many societies. The data on theintroduction of LTC systems presented in this study underlines this factand shows that the global diffusion of LTC systems is still at an earlystage. Only 43 of the 154 countries incorporated in our model havebeen classified as adopters of LTC systems by 2010. Five further coun-tries7 introduced an LTC system after the end of our observation period7 Azerbaijan (2014), Uruguay (2015), Uzbekistan (2015), Albania (2016), Greece (2016).6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 157and were treated as right-censored in our model. Furthermore, the intro-duction data was missing for 20 countries,8 which we also treated ascases without an LTC system, because initial country screenings suggestthat they did not introduce an LTC system until 2010. Both the earlystage of diffusion and data uncertainty restrict the present analysis. Asmentioned above, these concerns also led us to use only two steps for thepiece-wise constant rate function. We also refrained from including tradenetwork exposure and the additional trade existence control variable usedthroughout the edited volume, because there are neither substantial theo-retical arguments for the relevance of economic interdependencies inLTC, nor did it show any significant empirical result when included inthe model. However, for the sake of completeness, Tables 6.2 and 6.3 inthe appendix show model results which include trade exposure effects aswell.Besides the measurement problems associated with a lack of appro-priate data discussed for some explanatory variables—especially problempressure—above, there are also limitations concerning the operational-ization of the dependent variable. As discussed in the section on oper-ationalization and data, type-A LTC systems constitute rather incipientforms of social protection for LTC which are sometimes not recognizedas such (at the time) and often establish only rudimentary entitlementswhich may in fact be irrelevant to large parts of the population. However,political activism, the role of economic means for funding, and the diffu-sion of ideas may be stronger with regard to “big bang” events likethe introduction of distinct LTC systems (type B). For instance, theinsights on LTC policy transfer provided by existing case studies (seetheory section) all refer to the adoption of distinct LTC systems sincethe 1990s. Therefore, it might be fruitful to also further investigate theestablishment of distinct LTC systems, even if their small number makesa (statistical) analysis currently difficult.8 Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Moldova, Morocco,Nepal, New Zealand, North Korea, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda,Zimbabwe.158 J. Fischer et al.ConclusionOur analysis has identified several factors which advance the introduc-tion of LTC systems. These are, most notably, diffusion by means ofgeographical proximity, high political empowerment of women and, tosome extent, a high level of democratization. In general, it is surprisingthat both of our strongest LTC-specific hypotheses on international inter-dependencies, that is horizontal diffusion through cultural similarity andvertical diffusion within the extended EU group, have to be rejected.One explanation for the absent influence of the EU on the introductionof LTC systems may be that LTC policy in particular is regarded as anational matter by the member states, which is justified by the low legit-imacy of the EU in social policy issues. Moreover, many member stateshad already introduced LTC policies before 1993, which in turn allowsthe reverse assumption that member states influence the social policyagenda of the EU institutions. Moreover, as agenda setting only startedin the 1990s, it is possible that the EU influences the further develop-ment toward distinct LTC systems rather than the first legal provisionsin the field.On a more general note, when analyzing the results on the different“contagion channels,” it is important to bear in mind that LTC systemdiffusion is still an ongoing, accelerating process. Consequently, ourcurrent model provides a description of the early phase of diffusion,and not a generalizable explanation of the global diffusion process asa whole. The same methodological approach may identify other factorsor assign different relevance to them as more countries introduce LTCsystems subsequent to 2010. Recapturing the self-referential/endogenousdynamic of network diffusion processes, this might even lead to the iden-tification of further diffusion channels, which become more relevant asexposure thresholds mediated by their increase.With regard to national constellations , our findings provide verylimited support for the functionalist explanations on economic wealthand problem pressure. The lack of statistical evidence of the problempressure hypothesis is an unexpected result in view of the fact that thebody of international literature on LTC continuously stresses the rele-vance of aging while urging governments to introduce social protection6 Introduction of Long-Term Care Systems … 159schemes for LTC. Nevertheless, as the result of the interaction modelshows, a high share of elderly people seems to matter in countrieswith low to average wealth. Although not explicitly hypothesized in thischapter, one can regard this finding as partly supporting the functionalistexplanation relying on problem pressure. Unfortunately, due to a lack ofdata, we were unable to test the flip side of the problem pressure hypoth-esis relating to the availability of informal care as a functional equivalentto public LTC systems. Wealth itself does not seem to be a major drivingforce behind the introduction of LTC systems introduction. However,it still appears to be of importance as the influence of other factors,especially problem pressure, depends on economic affluence.Our actor-centered assumption about the political role of women isconfirmed. This result shows that women’s political participation is notonly important for the establishment of childcare policies (e.g., Bonoliand Reber 2010) but also with regard to elder care, which has untilnow been less examined. However, it is not completely clear what theunderlying mechanism of this positive effect is. On the one hand, asspecified in the theory section, it could be directly related to women’spolitical participation and activism. On the other hand, a general cultureof gender equality associated with high political empowerment of womencould also be behind this result. Furthermore, as regards one othercommon hypothesis of welfare theory, namely, the role of the politicalregime type, our findings also provide statistical evidence for the positiveinfluence of democratization. In fact, there have been very few introduc-tions in (strongly) autocratic regimes—only eight countries with an LTCsystem, mostly former members of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia,display a regime type score below five at the time of introduction.Overall, the present chapter provides—to our knowledge—the firstcross-country statistical analysis that explores why countries introducesocial protection for LTC dependency. By including variables whichmeasure both horizontal as well as vertical diffusion processes, we alsogo beyond the explanatory factors rooted in “methodological national-ism” which has often accompanied analyses of social policy development(cf. Obinger et al. 2013). Due to the fact that LTC is only recentlyevolving as a (distinct) policy, the field can provide fruitful ground forstudying both international interdependencies as well as sectoral path160 J. Fischer et al.dependencies, as we can currently observe the spread of the policies.Moreover, information and data are more readily available for this recenthistorical period than for the beginning of the twentieth century. Wetherefore conclude that the global diffusion of LTC systems will remaina worthwhile field for future study.AppendixSee Tables 6.2 and 6.3.Table 6.2 Results—additive diffusion models(1) (2) (3) (4)1945–1977 0.0001*** 0.0000*** 0.00*** 0.00***1978–2010 0.0000*** 0.0000*** 0.00*** 0.00***Women pol.empowermentindex1.05** 1.06** 1.05** 1.05**Share of population75+1.31+ 1.30+ 1.26 1.26Extended EU group 0.97 1.23 1.20 1.21GDP per capita 1.12 1.19 1.14 1.14Democratization 1.17+ 1.21* 1.20* 1.20*Trade existence 684,293.90*** 685,783.60***Network exposure:proximity111.19*** 203.81*** 373.76*** 374.59***Network exposure:culture0.05 0.09 0.08Network exposure:trade0.29 0.28Network exposure:colonies1.02Observations 9080 9080 9080 9080Log Likelihood −195.847 −195.104 −194.559 −194.557Akaike Inf.

Böger et al.child-rearing and reconcile care and work, have received only scant atten-tion. Gauthier’s book (1996) remains the definitive comparative in-depthstudy of the diverse origins and trajectories of family policy in the coun-tries that now belong to the group of rich, democratic welfare states.Comparative studies with a Latin-American (Blofield and Martinez Fran-zoni 2015; Blofield and Touchton 2020), East-Asian (Fleckenstein andLee 2017; Saraceno 2016), and even a global focus (Filgueira and Rossel2020) have started to appear, but for the most part, ignore the histor-ical roots of the policies they study. We provide the first global analysisof the origins of family policy, systematically testing established theoriesand propositions. This facilitates an assessment of the influence of inter-national linkages on the development of family policy, which is widelyacknowledged but proves difficult to pin down (White 2020).While contemporary family policies are often analyzed as a moreor less coherent “whole”, which can be characterized along dimensionssuch as “defamilization” or typologized according to how these poli-cies structure gender relations within the family, state interest in andsupport for families historically first appeared as “piecemeal interven-tions” rather than “comprehensive packages” (Gauthier 1996). It tookmore than half a century before family policies (plural) coalesced into adistinct and explicit family policy (singular), and even then, state inter-vention often remained far from coherent. Since we are interested inthe historical origins of family policy, we look at the adoption of paidmaternity leave, child benefits, and workplace childcare regulations inisolation, i.e., analyzing the first adoption of each of these family poli-cies. This also poses a relatively “easy” test for the effect of internationallinkages, which may wither away or work differently following these firstadoptions.To give an overview of the historical origins, to assess the types ofdomestic drivers put forward, and to gauge possible channels of diffu-sion, we first review the literature dealing with the three types of familypolicy. Then, we present data and models and appraise the generaliz-ability of earlier findings across time and space. A brief discussion ofmethodological and substantive limitations concludes.7 Origins of Family Policy: Prerequisites or Diffusion 171Family Policies: Historical Origins and Drivers2(a) Paid Maternity LeavePaid maternity leave policy was the earliest social protection policyexplicitly aimed at women workers. While other protective legislation,such as unpaid maternity leave and the prohibition of night work, oftenhad adverse effects on women’s economic empowerment by limitingthe job opportunities of women workers, paid maternity leave policyminimizes the difficulties of working mothers that go along with givingbirth without jeopardizing their economic independence (Htun et al.2019). Because paid maternity leave policies provide income compen-sation and often prohibit employers from dismissing women workersduring and after confinement, they secure their independence vis-à-vistheir employers and spouses. Whereas the different factions within thewomen’s movement disagreed on whether women-specific labor lawswere needed to achieve gender equality in the labor market, they agreedon the necessity of paid maternity leave (Berkovitch 1999; Boris 2019).Despite this fundamental role in providing social protection forwomen workers, little is known about the historical development ofpaid maternity leave policies. Historical accounts of social protectionprograms focus on the risks of old age, unemployment, and sickness(Esping-Andersen 1990; Flora and Heidenheimer 1981), often treatingpaid maternity leave only as a corollary to the general development ofsocial insurance principles. This research gap reflects the fact that theunit of analysis in early comparative welfare state research has alwaysbeen the average production worker in the manufacturing industry witha dependent spouse and two children, assuming, if not reflecting, thegendered division of labor (Orloff 1993; Sainsbury 2001). While femi-nist studies criticized this male breadwinner-centric conceptualizationand measurement of social rights, their own studies focused on the morerecently introduced childcare and parental leave policies. While pivotal2 The history and analysis of paid maternity leave was authored by Keonhi Son, of child benefitsby Simone Tonelli and of workplace childcare by Tobias Böger.172 T. Böger et al.to the question of how contemporary welfare states shape gender rela-tions (Leitner 2003; Saraceno 2011), these studies shed little light onthe forces that have “gendered” the welfare state since its beginnings.The few studies that focus on the historical development of paidmaternity leave emphasize the significant role of domestic actors andinstitutional developments. Gauthier argues that the fear of “familydecline” following industrialization and urbanization in early twentieth-century Europe triggered government responses, including paid mater-nity leave (Gauthier 1996). Case studies of European countries andthe U.S. have also emphasized the role of female agency (Hobson andLindholm 1997; Koven and Michel 1990; Sainsbury 2001). A recentpublication from Son and Böger expands the research scope to the globalscale and finds that women’s political empowerment and the generalexpansion of social protection policies have contributed to the extensionof access to maternity benefits from the 1880s to 2018 (Son and Böger2021).Among the scant studies of national maternity leave introduction,processes of observation of legislative activity in other countries rarelyfigure in and neither do references to norms set by global bodies. Thisis surprising because maternity protection was an agenda that arosewith the founding of the International Labour Organization (ILO) andhas continued to be a salient issue ever since. In the early twentiethcentury, women’s movements struggled to introduce and extend theright to maternity benefits by lobbying the ILO to adopt the MaternityProtection Convention, which functioned as an important organizationalplatform spreading maternity protection policies at the nation-state level(Berkovitch 1999). The ILO adopted the first Maternity ProtectionConvention (C003) when it was founded in 1919 during its first confer-ence and has since updated the standards for maternity protection everythree decades in two consecutive Maternity Protection Conventions(C103, C183), in 1952 and 2000. The ILO had been the only standard-setter until the European Union implemented its own standards in 1992(Pregnant Worker Directive 92/85/EEC) (Linos 2013, 130–131). Sonand Böger (2021) find that nation-states tend to extend the coverageand lower the eligibility criteria of maternity benefits shortly after they7 Origins of Family Policy: Prerequisites or Diffusion 173join the ILO. Their findings also signal the significant effect of long-standing membership, implying that the ILO consistently contributesto the extension of paid maternity leave policies by utilizing technicalexpertise and continuous dialogue with national governments.Another strand of studies emphasizes the impact of colonial domi-nation and legacies on welfare systems in the Global South. Schmitt(2015, 2020) finds that nation-states that share the same colonial experi-ence are likely to introduce social protection programs at a similar time,as colonizers often institutionalized social policies in response to a riseof labor strikes in the 1940s. Importantly, France introduced a unifiedlabor code that mirrored the French labor code in all French coloniesto stabilize the labor issue, namely the French Code du Travail (1952)which provided family allowances and maternity insurance for wageearners (Cooper 1996). Despite the limited coverage of the French Codedu Travail , its adoption brought about the introduction of paid mater-nity leave in 14 of 39 Sub-Saharan African countries with a generousamount of benefit (half of the previous wage) and a substantial durationof benefit (14 weeks) in the early phase of economic development (1952)in comparison to other middle- and low-income countries.Overall, the literature points toward the influence of the ILO (ILOhypothesis) and the reaction of colonial administrations to labor unrest(colonial hypothesis) as the main drivers of paid maternity leave intro-duction.(b) Child BenefitsEarly forms of child benefits, then mostly referred to as “familyallowances,” were introduced duringWorldWar I as a way to compensatefor the separation of men in the armed forces and their families, largelybecause it was found difficult to recruit them otherwise (Land 1985).These benefits were quickly withdrawn after the end of the conflict, butthe economic hardship, mounting unemployment, and political turmoilof the interwar period brought home the importance of having anincome stabilizer for large families (Hoffner 1935). The acknowledg-ment that having children was associated with a higher risk of poverty174 T. Böger et al.helped establish the principle that workers’ salaries should also be a func-tion of the size of their families. Such a principle pushed some advocatesof eugenics to argue against the introduction of family allowances, as itwould have only increased “the rate of multiplication” of individuals atthe bottom of the social scale (Darwin 1925). However, fear of depopu-lation prevailed over arguments of eugenics, and family allowances wereintroduced as a form of population policy to counter falling birth rates(Gille 1954; Watson 1954a, b).All in all, it is hard to find a single driver for the adoption of familyallowances. An overview of early writings on the topic highlights threemajor arguments that were put forward in support of their adoption.First, family allowances were considered a way to compensate a familyfor the consequences of war, be it the absence of the breadwinner orthe economic hardship that followed the two world wars (compensa-tion hypothesis) (Breul 1953; Doublet 1948; Kitchen 1981; Land 1985).Second, family allowances were intended as a living wage, i.e., adjustedfor family size (redistribution hypothesis) (Campbell 1927; Cousins1999; Hoffner 1935, 1940; Land 1985; Rathbone 1940), and finally,family allowances were intended as a means to counter falling birth rates(population hypothesis) (Biagi 1937; Campbell 1927; Cousins 1999;Gille 1954; Hoffner 1935, 1940; Land 1985; Watson 1954b).Although these three hypotheses advance our understanding of themechanisms that might drive the adoption of family allowances, therehave been few systematic attempts to test them. Partial support forthe compensation hypothesis can be found in recent contributions thatinclude some form of family benefits in the analysis. The authors findevidence that the two world wars were a catalyst in the developmentof European welfare legislation (Obinger and Schmitt 2020). Further-more, Schmitt (2020) argued that mass conscription during WW2 inFrench African colonies advanced the cause of extending social rights togroups previously excluded. In support of Schmitt’s argument, previousresearch has shown a positive statistical association between the timing ofthe introduction of family benefits and a colonial link to France (Kangas2012; Schmitt et al. 2015). Misra (1998, 2003) provides support of theredistribution hypothesis, showing that the working class and women’s7 Origins of Family Policy: Prerequisites or Diffusion 175movement were important factors leading to family allowance adop-tion in 18 industrialized countries. An empirical test of the populationhypothesis in the literature is missing, however, an association betweenfertility levels and the development of certain family benefits has beensuggested (Ferrarini 2006).Finally, recent scholarship in social policy diffusion has started toinvestigate the effect of state interdependencies on the introduction ofearly programs. Studying countries’ colonial relationships, Schmitt et al.(2015) present evidence that French and British colonial links impactedthe timing of adoption of family benefits. French colonial ties acceleratedthe timing of the introduction of family benefits, while British colonialties slowed it down, even in the postcolonial era.(c) Workplace Childcare RegulationThe public provision of care for children, especially those under threeyears old, was only weakly institutionalized in many countries untilrecently (O’Connor 1990). However, governments in the early twen-tieth century, as well as today, also utilized labor regulation to promotethe availability of childcare for young children without having to stepin as a provider themselves. Factory (or workplace) crèches or nurserieswere an early institution catering to working mothers. While these havebecome less widespread in European countries after the second worldwar, factory crèches and nurseries remain a viable avenue for work-familyreconciliation across the globe even today (Hein and Cassirer 2010).There are multiple historical antecedents of factory crèche legislation.In Europe, there was the charitable provision of childcare, promoted byF. Marbeau in France, as well as early philanthropic endeavors by busi-nessmen, such as R. Owen’s experiments in workplace education in thefactories of New Lanark, Scotland (Caroli 2019). These were driven,among other motives, by a shared concern for the health of newbornchildren, notably, the fear of rising infant mortality. At the time, theywere the first institutions that did not provide care to the illegitimatechildren of the poorest of the poor, but responded to the needs ofworking mothers. State intervention was pioneered in France: While the176 T. Böger et al.legislation passed in 1867 and 1897 only regulated crèches run as char-itable institutions, government interest began to shift as young womenentered the labor market. When female labor was needed in the produc-tion of ammunition during World War I, the French Act of the 5thof August 1917, prescribed the provision of nurseries to any establish-ment employing more than 100 women over 15 years old. It markedthe first introduction of regulatory measures, obliging private employersto provide relatively extensive childcare arrangements in Europe (Burger2012; Reynolds 1990). Even though—or perhaps because—it was onlyperceived as a “second-best” option by the left-wing socialists as well asthe right-wing pronatalists, after the War, the factory crèche had becomea highly visible and highly legitimate institution (Reynolds 1990).This convergence of various political forces on the issue of infantmortality and female employment is also apparent in a wide array ofcountries, which adopted similar policies in the early twentieth century.Among these were the fascist regime in Italy (1925/1926) and the SovietUnion (1932) (Caroli 2019), but also the late-late-developing countriesof the southern cone of Latin America: Chile (1917) and Argentina(1924) (Aguilar 2018; Casas and Herrera 2012).However, the parallel adoption of workplace childcare regulations mayalso have been triggered by processes of diffusion. Caroli (2019) notesthat the observation of French practices and models of childhood devel-opment helped foster the introduction of crèches in Italy and Russia,but also contends that national peculiarities shaped each country’s uniqueinstitutionalization of the crèche. While the ILO was involved in devisingstandards for the employment of pregnant women and mothers from itsfoundation onwards, it was not until after the Second World War thatit took on the issue of care in one of its recommendations (MaternityProtection Recommendation 95 in 1952; Workers with Family Respon-sibilities Convention 156 in 1981). However, the ILO never committeditself to the private provision of facilities, emphasizing the need for publicfinancing, regulation, and clearly expressing preference for provisionsoutside of the workplace.Since no systematic comparative study of workplace childcare regula-tion has been undertaken so far, and the available historical literature7 Origins of Family Policy: Prerequisites or Diffusion 177refrains from generalizing, our analysis of legislation remains mostlyexplorative.Data andMethodsThe models in this chapter closely follow the framework laid out in theintroduction, which is based on the work by Valente (1995). The dates ofadoption were generated using newly collected data of legislative activityin three main areas of family policy: paid leave, child benefits, and publiccare (Son et al. 2020; Tonelli et al. 2021). Figures 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 showthe spatial distribution of adoptions over time. To accommodate thefield of family policy, two key independent variables are added. The totalfertility rate (Gapminder 2020) reflects demographic pressures, whichhave often been hypothesized to trigger state intervention in families.Given that we are concerned only with the first adoptions of policies,higher fertility rates should decrease the hazard of adopting a familypolicy, especially family allowances. The membership in the ILO capturesan additional type of international linkage, which may facilitate (vertical)diffusion. Since the ILO’s advocacy for family allowances and workplaceFig. 7.1 The introduction of paid maternity leave178 T. Böger et al.Fig. 7.2 The introduction of child benefitsFig. 7.3 The introduction of workplace childcare regulationchildcare regulations has been limited in scope and its commitment topaid maternity leave has been renewed three times over the past hundredyears, we expect ILO membership to exert the strongest influence on theadoption of paid maternity leave.7 Origins of Family Policy: Prerequisites or Diffusion 179Regarding the other control variables, we do not hypothesize specificeffects for two reasons. First, family policy does not possess any elec-tive affinity to democracy. Pronatalist family policy developed in fascistregimes in the context of “authoritarian, largely anti-modern but alsonationalist familism” and as a project of the democratic left as a partof social reform (Therborn 2004). Second, we expect policy diffusionprompted less developed countries to adopt family policies at an earlystage of economic development, therefore nullifying the effect of thedegree of economic development (Collier and Messick 1975).(a) Maternity LeaveTable 7.1 shows the results of five discrete-time logistic hazard models,first displaying each type of network exposure separately then combined,thus capturing different potential avenues of diffusion. While we findlittle surprise in our results, three observations warrant elaboration. First,the stepwise-time-function is highly significant across models. While werefrain from its substantive interpretation in terms of hazard ratios, thisindicates that unobserved heterogeneity matters. Substantively, this istaken to imply that global trends, which affect all countries, influence thelikelihood of the adoption of maternity leave. While these may in partconsist of concurrent changes in domestic conditions, it may also reflecttruly global developments, such as the intensification of global trade orthe promulgation of global norms by the ILO and other standard-settingbodies, i.e., the activities of global “rationalized others” as hypothesizedby world society theory (Meyer et al. 1997). Second, and in line withexpectations, we find that membership in the ILO increases the hazard ofintroducing paid maternity leave by 65–82%. The strength of this effectis especially noteworthy when compared to the weak effects exerted bynetworks. The high legitimacy of the standards and expertise by the ILOin the field of maternity protection easily crowds out possible other chan-nels of diffusion. The colonial network stands out as an exception but caneasily be attributed to the outsize influence of the French Overseas LaborCode (1952) and the impact of the USSR on its republics. Finally, theeffect of democracy defies expectations of standard welfare state theorybut squares easily with the fact that the socialist countries in Eastern180 T.

Most countries that introduced a child benefitscheme did so within this time frame. After the 1960s, new introductions7 Origins of Family Policy: Prerequisites or Diffusion 181followed slowly, with only a marginal acceleration in the 1990s, occur-ring due to the diffusion of conditional cash transfers in middle-incomecountries.The models in Table 7.2 are again noteworthy in that the stepwise-time-function indicates strong time dependence across all specifications.Given that the larger coefficients can be found during the interwar andpostwar periods, these can carefully be interpreted as giving some indirectsupport to the compensation hypothesis.Most of the other covariates included in the models are not statisti-cally significant, but given that the sample includes a large share of thepopulation of reference, it seems relevant to discuss at least the estimatedTable 7.2 Global network diffusion of child benefitsDependent variable: introduction ofchild benefits(1) (2) (3) (4)1880–1904 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.0001905–1929 0.001*** 0.002*** 0.001*** 0.001***1930–1954 0.043** 0.040** 0.030** 0.027**1955–1979 0.062+ 0.027** 0.022** 0.019**1980–2010 0.017** 0.006*** 0.006*** 0.005***Trade existed (=1, else =0)1.522 1.844 1.314 1.511GDP per capita (log) 1.154 1.124 1.161 1.145Democratization 1.008 0.985 1.001 0.996Total fertility rate 0.666*** 0.617*** 0.683*** 0.690***ILO Membership 0.718 0.638 0.728 0.749Cultural spheres netw.: w.exposure (lag 1 year)0.165Colonies netw.: exposure 2.378**Trade net: w. exposure(lag 1 year)1.576Spatial proximity netw.: w.exposure2.287Observations 15,124 15,278 15,124 15,124Log Likelihood −464.908 −461.165 −465.858 −465.743Akaike Inf.

Existing states are 52–84% more likely to adopt child benefits,however, the estimates are not significant across specifications. GDP percapita is positively associated with child benefit introduction. In linewith our expectations, the level of democracy does not seem to affectthe hazard of introducing child benefits. The only statistically significantassociation is the number of births per woman. A one-unit increase inthe total fertility rate reduces the hazard of introducing a child benefitby 31–38%. This strongly supports the population hypothesis. Finally,even though the ILO called for the introduction of family benefits in its1952 Social Security Convention (C102), being a member of the ILO isassociated with a lower probability of introducing child benefits, but theassociation is again not significant.Network exposures are similar to other policy fields displaying stableeffects for the colonial and trade networks and highly unstable effectsfor the cultural spheres, which are highly sensitive to the inclusion ofspatial proximity. Interestingly, the higher the number of countries in acountry cultural network introducing child benefits (model 1), the lowerthe hazard of introducing child benefits. The association is, however, notsignificant. The colonial network exerts a high degree of influence onthe adoption of child benefits, increasing the hazard by 138% on itsown. Again, this is likely driven by the impact of the French OverseasLabour Code and the adoption of child benefits in the USSR. Simi-larly, the hazard of introducing child benefits is more than doubled whenneighboring countries do so. We refrain from reporting the results of themodel including all networks, because VIFs of the cultural and spatialnetwork in this model are 13.8 and 9.7, respectively, suggesting that thecoefficients are inflated due to multicollinearity.(c) Workplace Childcare RegulationWe finally turn to the set of models dealing with the adoption of work-place childcare legislation (Table 7.3). These follow the already familiarpattern of exhibiting significant time dependency, limited nationaleffects, and the identification of a single powerful diffusion channel.

Again, this may be due to common trends, but common shocksoriginating in global culture and politics must also be considered.184 T. Böger et al.As is the case with the other family policies, the presence of trade(data), which de facto acts as a proxy of political independence, exertssome influence. Independent countries with their own national tradeaccounts are between 70 and 93% more likely to adopt legislationmandating the private provision of factory nurseries than dependentterritories. Regarding GDP per capita, our expectation of an uncleareffect is substantiated by the coefficient as well as its lack of significance.We also find, contrary to expectations, a small but significant effectof regime type with more democratic regimes exhibiting a decreasedhazard—by around 15–20%—of adopting workplace childcare. Whilethe fertility rate remains insignificant across models, it points in theexpected direction decreasing the hazard of adoption by around 10%for each child per woman. Given that the ILO has only made limitedstrides into the field of factory childcare until recently, the strong effectof the ILO on workplace childcare legislation—more than tripling thehazard of adoption—is surprising.Turning to network exposition, we again find a strong effect of colo-nial ties on adoption, increasing hazards threefold. Similarly to the otherpolicies, we suspect that this is largely driven by the influence of theUSSR and the activity of the French colonial administration, whichenacted three pieces of legislation that included nursery clauses acrossthe French possessions: French Indochina in 1927, French Equatorial,and West Africa, both in 1954. The cultural spheres network proves tobe the most unstable as well as the hardest to attach substantive meaningto, yet again. While its effects point in the expected direction in models 1and 5, its inclusion substantially alters the effect of spatial proximity. Wesuspect that cultural similarity does not function as a channel of diffu-sion wholesale, but only for a much more restricted set of countries orcultures.Discussion and ConclusionOverall, the results of the discrete-time-hazard models are in some wayssobering: they did little to identify channels of diffusion, whose pres-ence was not established by earlier research. However, as a test of existing7 Origins of Family Policy: Prerequisites or Diffusion 185hypotheses, they broaden our understanding by expanding the historical,spatial, and policy-specific reach of previous analysis.Paid maternity leave, as the earliest form of decommodification aswell as defamilization for women, is confirmed as a showcase for theagenda-setting power of the ILO. Regardless of the ratification of specificconventions, continuous advocacy and technical assistance have urgedmore and more countries to fulfill the standards laid out in its conven-tions.Family allowances or child benefits, while also being advocated for bythe ILO, seem, except for the ‘imperial diffusion’ (Kuhlmann et al. 2020)through the Code du Travail , to be driven more by domestic concerns incomparison. Our models provide the first test of the hypothesis that lowfertility levels spur the adoption of benefits toward families with children,i.e., the emergence of family policy as population policy. However, thisshould not be interpreted as a purely domestic mechanism, since fearsof population decline were often understood in terms of comparativemilitary strength (Barrett and Frank 1999). The relational and transna-tional dimension of the “population hypothesis” is captured throughthe inclusion of the stepwise-time-function in our models: Coefficientsreflect effects relative to a period’s baseline hazard, which in turn impliesthat cross-country trends in fertility are captured by the stepwise-time-function. Hence, what is modeled is the effect of fertility relative to thegeneral level during each time period, which provides a very rough proxyfor processes of mutual observation.Finally, we analyzed the adoption of workplace childcare regulations,which have not been analyzed within comparative social policy literatureso far. Due to data limitations, we could not test the most prominenthypothesis found in the historical literature which connects the adop-tion of factory nurseries to infant mortality. We do, however, find thatcolonial networks, with the French again standing out, exert an outsizedinfluence on adoption.Across models, we find instructive patterns of time-dependency. Wehave refrained from giving much substantive weight to these since initself “time is not a theoretical variable” (Beck 2010). Yet, mentions of186 T. Böger et al.trends, phases, and periods that cut across cases and signify deep struc-tural shifts in the global environment of policymaking permeate thefamily policy (Daly and Ferragina 2018) and the broader welfare stateliterature (Nullmeier and Kaufmann 2010). Scholars in the traditionof world-society theory go so far as to assign explanatory primacy tothe global level, treating national legislative activity as mere emanationsof a “transnational event” (Abbott and DeViney 1992). The baselinehazards of all three policies indicate that the early twentieth century (paidmaternity leave) and the interwar years (child benefits and workplacechildcare) are decisive periods with heightened legislative activity acrossvaried national contexts. This suggests linking the emergence of familypolicy to industrialization, but also to the ideational and political shiftsof the early twentieth century.While the inclusion of networks is clearly a step forward in modelinglinkages between countries, their construction raises challenges andneeds to be informed by theory and historical case knowledge. Thecolonial network, in particular, suffers from treating linkages alike,whose effects differ systematically not only between colonizing/imperialpowers but also within colonial empires according to previous research(Lange 2004; Schmitt 2015). Results of auxiliary regressions with non-normalized exposure (see appendix) display more pronounced effects ofcolonial/imperial ties, indicating that family policies spread via directimperial linkages rather than colonial legacies.Despite these caveats, our analysis has highlighted that some of themain hypotheses identified by earlier research, which looked at a muchsmaller set of cases and a much shorter time frame, do in fact “travel”across time and space. It has also shown that colonial and other imperialrelations play an important role in the origin of family policies outsideof Western Europe. While these analyzes do not say anything explic-itly about the trajectories that followed introduction, earlier researchdemonstrated that family policy in Europe developed through a processof “layering” (Daly and Ferragina 2018), suggesting that the identifieddrivers have lasting effects which will shape family policy across the worldfor decades to come.7 Origins of Family Policy: Prerequisites or Diffusion 187AppendixSee Tables 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6.Table 7.4 Global network diffusion of paid maternity leave (alternative)Dependent variable:introduction of paidmaternity leave(1) (2)1880–1904 0.002*** 0.002***1905–1929 0.010*** 0.009***1930–1954 0.009*** 0.006***1955–1979 0.007*** 0.004***1980–2010 0.005*** 0.002***Trade existed (=1, else = 0) 6.280*** 5.444***GDP per capita (log) 1.523*** 1.530***Democratization 0.902* 0.899*ILO membership 1.929** 1.699*Total fertility rate 0.948 0.968Cultural spheres netw.: w. exposure (lag 1 year) 2.394Non normalized colonies netw.: exposure 3.247*** 3.333***Trade net: w. exposure (lag 1 year) 1.502Spatial proximity netw.: w. exposure (lag 1 year) 0.938Observations 10,817 10,663Log Likelihood −649.41 −648.054Akaike Inf.

GlobalNetwork Diffusion of AntidiscriminationLegislation in Employmentand Occupation: The ILO’s C111Jenny HahsIntroduction1Labor law, especially in its origins as an initially domestic domain, devel-oped in the context of, and in exchange and reaction to, developmentsin economic markets that required labor to produce their respectivegoods. These disputes did not always include the discernment thatrelated negotiation processes should be or had to be embedded in asocial–political framework.

Hahslaw, which provided a contractual definition of rights and obligationswithin the framework of subordination between employee and employer.A collectivized understanding of the common interests and problemswas a much later phenomenon and culminated in the emergence ofcollective labor law. It is no coincidence that the advent and heydayof collective labor law coincided with the nation-state-centered welfarestate of the Golden Age of the 1960s and 1970s. It formed one of thedimensions of democratic self-determination based on national citizen-ship, which became a pillar in the interplay with the expansion of socialwelfare, of normative legitimacy, and of factual acceptance of demo-cratic processes (Hurrelmann et al. 2007). Until today, the normativefoundation and justification of either expansion and democratic legiti-macy are the subject of constant renegotiation and renewal. However,these processes became increasingly decentralized and so power shiftedto the international sphere—with a mixed summary to date in terms ofadvocacy, implementation, and effectiveness.While the original idea of labor law was primarily the protectionagainst economic disadvantages, impairments, and health hazards, itdeveloped into a regulation of working life as a whole, mainly throughthe increasing involvement of collective actors and interest groups. Inthis process, the mutual integration with the prevailing social-politicalideas began. In its historical development, labor law has thus not onlyexperienced a horizontal differentiation but also a vertical one (Arthurs2011, 21–22; Davidov 2011). Moreover, areas of regulation were nowno longer only negotiated between national legislators (horizontal), butincreasingly relocated to transnational and global contexts between statesand under the organizational umbrella of international organizations(vertical).Even if upheavals are on the horizon, the International Labour Orga-nization (ILO) is still considered the central international organizationfor internationally agreed labor standards (Ebert 2015, 135; Helfer 2019)which must be implemented nationally. Its 102-year regulatory historyhas produced international labor standards that provide a comprehen-sive basis and framework for social policies. Their normative nature isnot without controversy and has raised the question of the cultural foun-dations, assumptions, and (regional) ideas on which they are based, for8 From Geneva to the World? … 197whom they are easier or more difficult to implement and comply with,and what function they thus have in international concertation. On thecontrary, it has been argued that over the last decades the ILO were notin a monopolistic position anymore (Chen 2021) on labor standard-setting, since a growing body of these standards has been nested intotransnational labor standards such as free trade agreements, investmentarrangements, policy documents of international financial institutions,and social missions of multinational corporations.These remarks are based on the assumption that prior to these recentdevelopments, the ILO was the sovereign body in the field of interna-tional labor standards. And while territoriality as a fundamental principleof labor law is widely uncontested (Mundlak 2009), developments in thecontext of globalization have raised new regulatory needs and demands,resulting in concepts such as ex- or deterritorialized forms of labor law.One of the consequences has been the increased international concerta-tion and the massive expansion of labor regulation at the internationaland global levels.2The Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention,1958 (No. 111) (from now on referred to as C111) is particularly inter-esting in this context. The adoption of C111 marked the ILO’s firstlegally binding endorsement of nondiscrimination and an early equalopportunity approach at work. Although considered to be premisedupon “a traditional, formal-equality and formal-workplace vision ofantidiscrimination law” (Sheppard 2015, 249), the convention markeda genuine new strand in international standard-setting in the post-World War II and Philadelphia Declaration time. As a classic regulatoryinstrument, it was elevated to the status of a core labor standard in1998 in the course of the Declaration on Fundamental Principles andRights at Work. These standards are not only subject to the usual rati-fication and national implementation procedures. Core labor standardsapply universally to all members by virtue of their ILO membership.As a classic regulatory instrument at the international level, C111 thus2 For a concise overview of the expansion of ILO international labour standards after WorldWar II, see Hahs (2021b).198 J. Hahsretains the principle of territoriality (since the content of the regula-tions must be implemented nationally), while as a universal standardwithin the framework of the Declaration it becomes normatively validin a deterritorializing manner.The aim of this article is to first examine in principle if network speci-ficities have influenced the ratification of C111. Like the other authors,I draw on the global network data that is used throughout this editedvolume. These networks depict cultural similarity, colonial legacies,trade, and geographic proximity. Furthermore, the diffusion of interna-tional labor standards can have a homogenizing effect on national formsof labor regulation. However, there is also the question of the influence ofalready existing similarities between ratifying states. I will refer to this ina broader sense as, second, the influence of the national legal homogeneityin light of the territoriality of labor law. To map these national character-istics, I utilize a new national equality index that measures the de jureimplementation status of national equality legislation. Further, the legalorigin of a member, and the duration of membership in the ILO areconsidered.While the general portfolio and history of ILO standards are now wellstudied, theory-based statistical analysis of their ratification history anddiffusion along national characteristics are rare. To the author’s knowl-edge, studying the ratifications of an ILO convention as interactionprocesses in a network is both a novelty and the methodological aim ofthis chapter. I thereby contribute to the existing body of literature on thediffusion and ratification of ILO labor standards by adding a large-scalequantitative assessment through network analysis.The chapter is structured as follows: In section “State of the Art:Transnational Antidiscrimination Law as a Tool to Provide Spaces andVehicles to Challenge Domestic Labor Law’s Exclusion?”, I situate C111in the field of transnational antidiscrimination law and in its interac-tion with national law. In section “Theorizing Transnational DiffusionProcesses of International Labor Standards”, I discuss the state of the artin diffusion research of international labor rights, while in section “Dataand Methods”, I present the underlying data construction and anal-ysis methodology. Section “Results” presents the results of the networkanalysis and section “Conclusion” concludes the chapter.8 From Geneva to the World? … 199State of the Art: TransnationalAntidiscrimination Law as a Tool to ProvideSpaces and Vehicles to Challenge DomesticLabor Law’s Exclusion?The ILO’s standard-setting function has produced a vast number ofinternational labor standards. In essence, transnational labor law (TLL),according to Blackett and Trebilcock (2015, 4):has emerged to problematize and resist the direction of social regulationunder globalization. Recognizing globalization’s asymmetries, and identi-fying spaces for action, TLL operates within, between and beyond statesto construct counter-hegemonic alternatives. The field critically encom-passes actions beyond the state, to take into account the actions oftransnational enterprises, labour federations, civil society and other actors.Moreover, TLL does not stop where national labour law begins: the twoare deeply intertwined and challenge each other. TLL is a form of multi-level governance, including the international, the regional, the national,and the shop floor: its ability to address challenges of economic inter-dependency is similarly enmeshed with its ability to acknowledge anddeal with complexity, diversity and asymmetries across time and space—amongst states, across uneven regional development, amongst vastlydifferently empowered institutions and actors. TLL holds no monopolyon either the rise of legal centrism through the prevalence of “rule oflaw” doctrines, or the expansion of pluralist, reflexive new governancemethods. Its distinctiveness lies in its capacity to be counter-hegemonicand promote social justice.Blackett and Trebilcock emphasize further that “law’s normative char-acter is indeterminate and must be the basis of continuous struggle forsocial justice, that is at the core of TLL’s emergence” (Blackett and Trebil-cock 2015, 4). Indetermination and its inherent struggle are thus thebasis and the result of the world society’s negotiation and agreement todevelop the desired legal regulations, to endow them with binding force,and to implement them. As commonplace as it may sound at first, TLLsthemselves are not a product of chance, nor is their dissemination (Chauet al. 2001; Baccini and Koenig-Archibugi 2014).200 J. HahsUniversalization and the idea of equality were already conceived andnamed as fundamental and desirable in both the ILO Constitution of1919 and in its Declaration of Philadelphia of 1944. However, they wereonly given concrete legal expression in two instruments in the post-warperiod: C100, with a clear reference to gender equality (“equal pay forwork of equal value”) and C111 (Hepple 2009, 129).C111’s core message is a universal idea of equal treatment and equalopportunities in employment and education, free from discriminatorypractices based on race, color, sex, religion, political opinion, nationalextraction, or social origin. Although the convention directly referred tothe globally universalizing aims of the Declaration of Philadelphia in itspreamble, it retained, however, a Global North and formal employment-prone loophole in allowing that “other special measures designed tomeet the particular requirements of persons who, for reasons such assex, age, disablement, family responsibilities or social or cultural status,are generally recognized to require special protection or assistance, shallnot be deemed to be discrimination” (Art. 5. Para. 2). Even thoughthe introduction of C100 and C111 made great steps toward the dejure acceptance and regularization of women’s work in particular (whichhad not been a matter of course until then), there was still no regu-latory idea for the diverse forms that women’s work brought with it.This was and still is especially true for informal and nonstandard formsof employment (NSFE), even though they represented the dominantlabor practice in the Global South. There was also a lack of framingregulatory ideas for the equitable distribution of care work between thegenders and accompanying public support structures. Although C111created the basis for a future holistic social policy concept, major ques-tions of adequate, concrete implementation and embedding remainedunanswered. It should also be noted that Afro-Asian countries used theprocess around the adoption of C111 to make the hitherto still existentdifferences in regulatory practices of the colonial labor regime betweenregular, mainly European workers and indigenous laborers more visibleand to also condemn the colonial powers (Maul et al. 2019, 239). Thiswas another result of the segmented regulatory world of work along thelines of unequal working conditions for women and men, as well as8 From Geneva to the World? … 201between colonial and noncolonial labor law regimes, which were alsoa corollary of ILO norm-setting at the time of C111’s creation.In 1998, C111 entered the canon of the core labor standards. Theelimination of discrimination with respect to employment and occu-pation (and within that C111) became one of the four constitutionalprinciples as outlined in the Declaration on Fundamental Principles andRights at Work of 1998. This altered its status. It is a core principleof the ILO Constitution that members may adopt and ratify conven-tions freely and without coercion. In turn, the core labor standards werechosen because they embody rights that are considered fundamental inthe ILO Constitution. Consequently, regardless of ratification and levelof development, ILO members are constitutionally obliged to respectand promote them.3As opposed to traditional labor law, which tries to focus on coun-tering vertical inequality, C111 tackles horizontal inequality as part ofantidiscrimination law (Sheppard 2015, 257):Anti-discrimination law was historically limited to remedying horizontalinequality linked to group-based exclusions and disadvantages based ondiscrete grounds, such as race, national or ethnic origin, sex, disability,sexual orientation or religion. In contrast, labor laws primarily concernedwith remedying social inequality and poverty based on the verticalinequalities between workers and employers. Labor law, with its focuson collective bargaining and employment standards in the formal labormarket, too often excluded the concerns of marginalized workers whoalso tend to be members of the social groups traditionally protected byanti-discrimination law.By virtue of its conception, C111 had the potential to be a tool “toprovide spaces and vehicles” to counter domestic labor law’s exclusions.Figure 8.1 shows the development of ratifications of C111 over time.Compared to the other diffusion processes in this volume, the ratifi-cations of C111 are a more recent phenomenon. The Convention was3 The status of the Core Labour Standards also means a higher annual reporting cycle for eachcountry that has not ratified one or more core conventions. For a comprehensive discussion ofthe systemic effect of the core labour standards on the ILO’s international labour rights regime,see Alston (2004) and the reply of Langille (2005).202 J. HahsFig. 8.1 Ratifications of discrimination (employment and occupation) conven-tion, 1958 (No. 111)adopted in 1958 and finally entered into force in 1960. The largest waveof ratifications took place between 1960 and 1980. This coincided withdecolonization and the new or re-entry of numerous former, mainlyAfrican, colonies into the ILO, which also explains the large propor-tion of ratifications by countries in the Global South. Between 1981and 2000, more sovereign members of the former Soviet Union and newmembers, especially from Asia, ratified. The third wave included mainlyCentral African and South Pacific countries, but also China. To date, 12ILO members have not ratified the Convention.4 Nevertheless, C111 isone of the best-ratified conventions in the ILO’s regulatory portfolio.With its regulatory scope, C111 paved the way for the UN’s thirdgeneration of human rights: the International Convention on the Elimi-nation of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) and the Conven-tion on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women(CEDAW) were adopted in 1965 and 1979, respectively. It is oftendiscussed to what extent the UN human rights conventions—to the4 These are: Brunei Darussalam, Cook Islands, Japan, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Myanmar,Oman, Palau, Singapore, Tonga, Tuvalu, United States of America (International LabourOrganization 2021).8 From Geneva to the World? … 203detriment of the ILO’s C111—became necessary as “true” universalantidiscrimination instruments for strongly overlapping areas of regu-lation, since this convention, despite its universalist claim, primarilyaddressed workers in formal employment.Theorizing Transnational Diffusion Processesof International Labor StandardsThe transnational diffusion of international labor standards has so farbeen surprisingly undertheorized. This is probably due to the predomi-nantly qualitative-comparative empirical share of mostly country studieson the interplay of ILO standards and national legal developments. Tothe author’s knowledge, no theorizing meta-studies have been done sofar—probably because the academic debate on international labor stan-dards is a complex interdisciplinary undertaking. It operates on theverge of organizational theory at the edge of international relations,organizational sociology, and political science as well as legal (history)approaches.The interlinkage of the ILO’s internal governance structures with itsresulting standard-setting processes has so far been studied quantitative-comparatively and predominantly in the framework of power depen-dence theory (Landelius 1965), neofunctionalism (Haas 1962, 2008[1964]), and rational choice (Boockmann 2001).Extended borrowings can be made from approaches in the fieldof norm diffusion within international organizations (Park 2006) andtransnational idea and policy diffusion (Gilardi 2013). Although aspecialized field, theoretical approaches of the legal scholarship relatedto the interaction of the different levels of labor law (Davidov 2011) andthe interaction of the different implementation systems of internationallabor standards (Leary 1982) have been elaborated for much longer andin greater depth, making them relevant as well.The International Relations scholarship has contributed largelythrough constructivist insights (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). Park(2006) builds on their previous work and links an organizational iden-tity that goes beyond former rationalist nation-state interests and the204 J. Hahsinfluence of intraorganizational norms that define appropriate behaviorof actors within the international system and can thus explain normdiffusion success or failure. Her argument is hence that “the norms IOsespouse are the result not only of state power but of their socializa-tion by non-state actors, and more specifically, by transnational advocacynetworks” (Park 2006, 353). A more recent strand of post-functionalistresearch explains the structure of the policy portfolio of internationalorganizations as a contingent functional and social outcome of theongoing social negotiation processes of actors bargaining about the orga-nizations’ internal governance in light of a common social structuralframework (Hooghe et al. 2019). The strength of both approaches residesin explaining the approval of seemingly counterintuitive policy decisionsby members. This is the case, for example, when members ratify conven-tions that initially appear to be disadvantageous for them in terms oftheir status quo.According to Gilardi (2013, 454), there exists a scholarly consensusthat diffusion can be defined as a consequence of interdependence. Herefers more specifically to the work of Simmons, Dobbin, and Garrettwho declared that “[i]nternational policy diffusion occurs when govern-ment policy decisions in a given country are systematically conditionedby prior policy choices made in other countries” (Gilardi 2013, 454). Inline with Elkins and Simmons’ work, he adds that “the definition empha-sizes diffusion as a process, as opposed to an outcome” and concludesthat because of this, “diffusion is not equivalent to convergence. A signif-icant increase in policy similarity across countries – a common definitionof convergence […] – can, but need not, follow from diffusion. Even ifit does, convergence characterizes the outcome of the process, but notthe nature of the process itself ” (Gilardi 2013, 454).In drawing on his earlier work with Braun, he states that theunderlying diffusion mechanisms are “systematic sets of statements thatprovide a plausible account of how policy choices in one country aresystematically conditioned by prior policy choices made in other coun-tries” (Gilardi 2013, 460). Furthermore, Gilardi subsumes that thescholarly consensus is that most mechanisms can be grouped into fourbroad categories, which the other authors of this book have also referredto: coercion, competition, learning, and emulation.8 From Geneva to the World? … 205Coercion is the imposition of a policy by powerful international orga-nizations or countries; competition means that countries influence oneanother because they try to attract economic resources; learning meansthat the experience of other countries can supply useful information onthe likely consequences of a policy; and emulation means that the norma-tive and socially constructed characteristics of policies matter more thantheir objective consequences. (Gilardi 2013, 461)The diffusion processes examined below are understood and analyzedin terms of emulation. Finnemore and Sikkink (1998) have arguedthat norm diffusion processes involve the mechanism of emulation.This occurs in a three-step process: norm emergence, norm cascade,and norm internalization. In the first phase of norm emergence , newrules of appropriate behavior are brought to the tableau by normentrepreneurs and with the help of internal support of the organiza-tion. It takes a critical mass of states, about one-third of the potentialadopters according to Finnemore and Sikkink (1998, 901), who havebeen successfully convinced to recognize the new norm and to advancethe dynamic toward the stage of norm cascade . In this second phase,norms are promoted in a socialization process by rewarding conformityand punishing noncompliance. In this phase, the reaction of the inter-national community to their behavior is increasingly important to themember states. This can have a sensitive influence on their domesticlegitimation and power. With the establishment and consolidation ofthis influence from the second phase, the process of norm integrationhas entered its final phase: the internalization stage. The norms are thenso profoundly accepted that they are now taken for granted as the onlypossible type of accepted behavior. Gilardi has added another interestingoutcome of this process which Finnemore and Sikkink themselves onlyindirectly address, which is that the burden of proof shifts over time:In the early stages, it is the actors who wish to introduce women’s suffrage,smoking bans, or any other policy who need to demonstrate that thesepolicies are needed, appropriate, and politically feasible. As the normdynamic unfolds, the burden shifts to actors who do not want the policyto be introduced, who need to work harder to make their case than thosewho support it. Because norm dynamics lead to a change in dominant206 J. Hahsnorms, once the new norm has taken over or is about to do so (aroundthe tipping point in the “norm cascade”), the new rules become orthodoxand the old heterodox, which shifts the balance of power between propo-nents and opponents. In other words, late in the process it is opponents,and no longer proponents, who need to engage in ‘norm contestation’.(Gilardi 2013, 467–468)As was shown in the previous section, the evolution of C111 itself as wellas the importance it was ascribed over time in the norm portfolio of theILO is a perfect example of the three-stage emulation process of normdiffusion as presented by Finnemore and Sikkink.Data andMethodsI attempt to explain the development of the ratifications of the ILO’sC111 by using a discrete time logistic regression with network effectsof networks of geographical distances, global trade, cultural spheres,and colonial legacies as well as by the mediating influences of covari-ates. The latter reflects national specifics such as the legal origin anddegree of integration into the intraorganizational context through theduration of membership in the ILO. The specificity of the dependentvariable ratification of the C111 requires methodological adjustments tothe original diffusion model as outlined in Chapter 1. These adaptationsare succinctly sketched out below. Nevertheless, the analysis follows inessence the methodology detailed in Chapter 1 and thus contributescomparable findings to those of my colleagues from the other socialpolicy fields in this volume on the global diffusion of international laborrights.The assumed diffusion mechanism of contagion, according to whichthe probability of encountering to meet an “infected” and thus of “infect-ing” oneself increases over time as a result of increasing contact betweensubjects, also makes sense in principle for the study of ratification diffu-sion within international organizations. However, in comparison to thestudy of intergovernmental diffusion processes, this means an additionallevel of interaction (see Fig. 8.2), with its own intervening possibilities ofcontagion which must be methodologically considered and taken into8 From Geneva to the World? … 207Fig. 8.2 Level of analysis and risk set identification in network analysis ofintraorganizational ratification behavioraccount. On the one hand, a merely limited subgroup of all states thatare together members of the organization (here the ILO) meet and canonly infect each other within this framework. This is because ratifica-tions of ILO conventions are only possible for and therefore restrictedto ILO members. On the other hand, members of an organization arealso members of the “world sample” of all existing and interacting states,thus in the original sense of the conceptualization of the networks usedhere according to Chapter 1. Organization members are not decoupledfrom world events outside the organization, but at the same time addition-ally determined by intra-organizational contagion processes. This means,for example, that colonialist influences can be given additional weight,as they can exert an effect both outside and inside the organization.Trade relations can also amplify existing extraorganizational imbalanceswithin the organization. This is particularly the case when hegemonicextra-organizational inequality structures find a renewed reflection in theintraorganizational ones. However, these organizational structures alsohave the potential, at least in principle, to counter external hegemonicstructures with alternatives through intraorganizational organization.Conceptualizing this is not without risk of getting lost in thecomplexity of the processes that affect decision-making and opinionformation within organizations. For this reason, the covariates proposedhere cover the three possible intervening levels with reference to indi-vidual member states only. They are not intended to control forindividual country involvement in intraorganizational decision-makingprocesses, which could also boost or mitigate ratification aspirations.208 J. HahsIn order to test for the influence of national characteristics, the legalorigin and a newly created national de jure equality index were takeninto account. To check on a generalized level for mediating influencesof organizational membership, the duration of membership in the ILOwas considered. Aspirations toward a respective regulation norm, whichcould motivate states to ratify conventions faster, are only taken intoaccount insofar as the duration of membership can be understood asa proxy for a basic acceptance of the general organizational idea behindthe ILO itself.The original country sample of the networks presented by Mossiget al. (2021, in this volume) also has consequences for the sample ofILO members examined here. Of the 164 countries in the original riskset, three have never been members of the ILO: Bhutan, South Sudan,and Taiwan. They are therefore excluded in principle from the risk set,resulting in a total of 161 countries. The period covered spans from1880 to 2010, meaning ratifications that took place after 2010 are nottaken into account. This does not affect a lot of ratifications, thus thedata is right censored. Another restriction of the networks weighs moreheavily: the exclusion of states with less than 500,000 inhabitants fromthe networks. Especially in the last decades of ILO membership devel-opment, it is precisely and predominantly these states that have becomenew members. These members are therefore also not part of the risk setin the study presented here. Since this mainly concerns island states, thefindings here are not relevant for them and there remains a residual riskthat their influence is systematically underestimated. Further studies areneeded on this. A total of 112 ILO members are thus included in theanalysis.C111 comes with a twofold determined temporality of its owncompared to the other diffusion processes in this volume. The conven-tion was adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1958 andentered into force in 1960, after the first two mandatory ratificationswere registered. The analysis presented here therefore essentially refersto the period from 1958 to 2010. Furthermore, the time intervalswith which time dependency as a result of unobserved heterogeneity inthe piecewise constant step function is to be controlled were thereforeadapted. Although they are oriented toward intraorganizationally impor-tant epochs, these are often connected with extra-organizational events.8 From Geneva to the World? … 209Table 8.1 gives an overview of the main ILO milestones and (UN) histor-ical turning points relevant for the chosen periods which were takeninto account for the analysis. The selection is based on the assumptionthat both key ILO declarations on the core issues of the Conventionand relevant UN global political developments had an influence on theratifications in the designated periods.The data on the national ratification dates of C111 was taken fromthe new History of ILO Instruments Database (HILODB, Hahs 2021a),which will be published soon. A convention creates legal obligationsqua ratification for the ratifying member. According to Article 19, 5(d)of the ILO Constitution, these are to “take such action as may benecessary to make effective the provisions” of a ratified Convention.Table 8.1 Periodization alongside ILO milestones and (UN) historical turningpointsPeriodization ILO milestones (UN) historical turning points1958–1968 Post-period of Declarationof Philadelphia(Re-)admission of SovietUnionIndependence of Africanstates (1960)Birth of Non-AlignedMovement (1961)1969–1979 Declaration of Equality ofOpportunity andTreatment for WomenWorkers (1975)International Convention onthe Elimination of All Formsof Racial Discrimination(ICERD) (in force 1969)First World Conference onWomen (Mexico City, 1975)1980–1998 Declaration on FundamentalPrinciples and Rights atWork (1998)Second, Third and FourthWorld Conference onWomen (Copenhagen 1980,Nairobi 1985, Beijing 1995)Convention on theElimination of All Forms ofDiscrimination AgainstWomen (CEDAW) (in force1981)“Washington Consensus”Dissolution of Soviet Union1999–2010 Declaration on Social Justicefor a Fair Globalization(2008)CEDAW Optional Protocol(1999)Global financial crisis (2008)Source International Labour Organization (2009, 03.02.2021); own representa-tion210 J. HahsThis applies to both de jure and de facto implementation and transferinto national practice—such as court decisions, arbitration awards, orcollective agreements alongside national laws.The membership duration of the countries considered was calculatedon the basis of data provided by the International Labour Organization(2020). It measures the duration of a country’s membership in the ILO attime t and is consequently a relative measure of the maturity of member-ship. I follow the results of Boockmann (2001) and assume that older,more “experienced” members are more susceptible to rapid self-inducedratification, while “younger” members become infected later after severalcontacts with those already infected.I also control for the legal origin of a member country. La Porta et al.(2008, 287) classified countries’ legal systems based on the assumptionthat law and legal systems became transmitted as “bits of information”through channels such as trade, conquest, colonization, missionary work,migration, etc., from one country to another. Typically, legal transplanta-tion took place between a few mother countries and the rest of the world.Drawing on the ongoing discussion in the legal scholarship, they distin-guish between two main legal traditions (common law and civil law)and fine-tune their analysis to also cover subtraditions within civil law(French, German, socialist, and Scandinavian). According to Ahleringand Deakin (2005, 881–882), the influence of legal origin on the labormarket is indirect:[…] it is mediated through the practice of regulation, or ‘regulatory style.’If a system has adopted a particular regulatory approach in one area, it ismore likely to do so in another. In addition, the marginal cost of adoptingthe laws of the parent system are lower than attempting to begin anewwith new methods and procedures. Thus ‘path dependence in the legaland regulatory styles emerges as an efficient adaptation to the previouslytransplanted legal infrastructure’ (Botero et al. 2004: 1346). Although noreference is made here to the concept of institutional complementarities,the same basic idea seems to be at work.Chau et al. (2001, 129–130) subsume that the legal origin of a countrycan have an influence on the natural labor standard “(i) directly via the8 From Geneva to the World? … 211ideological bias it imposes on the relative importance of the state vis-à-vis the individual, and (ii) indirectly via its influence on the performanceof government to protect the rights of individuals and government effi-ciency.” Therefore, institutional factors, which in turn are determined bythe legal tradition of a country, could delay ratifications, even though onecould have expected it based on the economic constitution of a country.It is not possible to address the full range of criticisms of the transfer-ability of legal origin to labor rights within the scope of this chapter. As arepresentative example, Ahlering and Deakin’s (2005, 900–901) critiqueweighs particularly heavily, pointing to the sometimes large historicaloverlaps of regulatory logics in labor law and criticizing allegedly clearideational path dependencies. It is largely on the basis of this critiquethat I have chosen to examine the relevance of legal origins for equalityregulation.Finally, the national equality index maps the annually averaged dejure strength value of national antidiscrimination law equivalent tothe different dimensions of the ILO’s international antidiscriminationconvention C111. It is calculated from six indicators of the WoL dataset5(Dingeldey et al. 2021), which quantify the dimensions of antidiscrim-ination considered in the C111. The values vary between 1 (“legallyguaranteed”) and 0 (“no such guarantee exist”), with downward grada-tions indicating limited guarantees, weaker recommendations, or thenon-inclusion and non-regulation of subareas of the antidiscriminationidea according to C111.To sum up, the lack of available global diffusion data so far hasseverely limited the empirical and theoretical development of diffusionnetwork effects as well as the development of a more profound under-standing of contagion mechanisms in the field of transnational norm5 The indicators used are: e01 (“The law provides for equal opportunities for men and womenin terms of access to employment”), e02 (“The law provides for regulation of positive discrim-ination [affirmative action/special measures] in order to overcome labour discrimination ofwomen”), e03 (“The law provides for equal opportunities concerning ethnicity/race in termsof access to employment”), e04 (“The law provides for regulation of positive discrimination[affirmative action/special measures] in order to overcome labour discrimination of groupsdisadvantaged in terms of ethnic/racial backgrounds”), e06 (“The law provides for equal oppor-tunities for men and women in terms of working conditions”), and e07 (“The law provides forequal opportunities in terms of working conditions concerning ethnicity/race”).212 J. Hahsdiffusion. Despite all its limitations, the analysis presented here is themost comprehensive to date with regard to the influence of networks onthe ratification of an ILO convention (here: C111).ResultsFigure 8.3 shows the development of the share of ratifiers per year andthe cumulative ratifiers. Overall, a continuous and balanced increase canbe seen. It is also clear that half of the ratifiers had already ratified by1973. Visible increases occur once again in the early 1990s and from1998 onwards. The critical mass of one-third of all ratifiers, i.e., thecritical tipping point for the start of the norm cascade phase accordingto Finnemore and Sikkink (see section “Theorizing Transnational Diffu-sion Processes of International Labor Standards”), was reached withinthe first six years after the adoption of the convention. Since the numberof ratifiers subsequently increases at an almost constant rate, no specialeffect can be observed here—at least descriptively—of the norm cascadeFig. 8.3 Ratifier and cumulative ratifier proportion of C111, 1959–2010 (N =150)8 From Geneva to the World? … 213phase which then theoretically follows and which rewards complianceand sanctions deviation. Attention should be drawn to the huge increasearound 1960, lifting the share of ratifiers to 0.2. Since there was a largeincrease in membership in 1960, especially from former African colonies,this can be interpreted as an indicator that the underlying regulatoryagenda of the convention was in the interest of both the new and theold members. I have pointed out before that through blaming, shaming,and condemnation, the process of drafting and adopting C111 was alsoused by hitherto still existing colonies to draw attention to the fact that,to their detriment, there existed a “colonial labor code” in parallel tothe regular canon of ILO standards, the latter of which applied to otherworkers but excluded them.The leaps around 1990 and 1998 then point to the two remainingphases. The second phase, the norm cascade phase, got a push in theearly 1990s after a long period of continuous growth. As Table 8.1 showsseveral key elements such as declarations, world conferences on women,and the establishment of UN human rights conventions communicatedthe contents and ideas of the C111 to the world as a global socialconsensus and thus strengthened and promoted them.Ratification was no longer only possible in principle nor solely the ideaof a norm entrepreneur elite; instead, it became socially desirable in thestructure of the international organization and increasingly binding bymeans of soft law. The internalization stage was reached at the latest by1998, when the C111 was elevated to the status of a core labor conven-tion and thus considered fundamentally binding in its regulatory ideafor all ILO members, even without individual ratification. Antidiscrim-ination can now be regarded as something that is “taken for granted.”Moreover, what Gilardi called the reversal of the burden of justifica-tion has occurred: states must now officially justify why they do notadequately implement antidiscrimination rights.A look at the share of ratifications of members classified accordingto the World Bank income categories in Table 8.2 also provides inter-esting insights. Boockmann’s (2001) econometric analysis of the dura-tion between non-ratification and ratification of conventions hingedprimarily on the implied costs of implementation for nonindustrializedcountries. In industrialized countries, on the other hand, the preferences214 J. HahsTable 8.2 Ratifier categories (according to adopter categorization of Rogers2003) by World Bank Income GroupWorldBankIn-comeGroupAdopter categorization according to Rogers (2003[1962])EarlyadoptersEarlymajority LaggardsLatemajorityNon-adopters TotalHighincome9 16 8 10 4 4719.15 34.04 17.02 21.28 8.51 100.0025.00 30.77 21.62 40.00 28.57 28.66Uppermiddleincome10 14 12 5 3 4422.73 31.82 27.27 11.36 6.82 100.0027.78 26.92 32.43 20.00 21.43 26.83Lowermiddleincome10 10 14 6 5 4522.22 22.22 31.11 13.33 11.11 100.0027.78 19.23 37.84 24.00 35.71 27.44Lowincome7 12 3 4 2 2825.00 42.86 10.71 14.29 7.14 100.0019.44 23.08 8.11 16.00 14.29 17.07Total 36 52 37 25 14 16421.95 31.71 22.56 15.24 8.54 100.00100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00Note First row has frequencies, second row has row percentages, and third rowhas column percentagesSource Own calculationsof central governmental actors were more decisive for the duration ofratification. But the cost argument cannot be easily accepted for C111.The majority of low-income countries belong to the early ratifiers orthe early majority. Surprisingly, almost half of the ILO’s high-incomemembers (46.81%) are Laggards, Late Majority, or Non-Adopters. Vosko(2010) has comprehensively reviewed the long road that has been takenin the departure from the standard Western-oriented male-breadwinneremployment relationship. It can only be assumed at this point thatthese effects are also reflected in the ratification behavior of the mainlyWestern-dominated high-income countries. Further research on this isneeded elsewhere.Table 8.3 shows the result of the discrete-time logistic hazard esti-mations in hazard ratios.

The hazard ratios for the networks represent theodds of a member country ratifying C111 given the exposure throughthe network in question to countries that had already ratified C111.All models were calculated twice: Model 1 and Model 2 cover all 161countries in the network sample for which data on legal origin and thenational equality index were available. Models 3 and 4 refer to the smaller216 J. Hahsrisk set of ILO members for which the same data were available. Thus,pure network effects could be examined (Models 1 and 2) and theirsignificance compared with the results of the pure ILO sample (Models3 and 4).The assumptions from the descriptive observation with regard to thetemporal development of ratifications are basically confirmed. Consid-ering all baseline hazard rates together, there is an overall indication of adecreasing rate over time because these rates become smaller across timeperiods. But as interpreting time effects in these models is unusual, wewill not go further into this. It is interesting, however, that a look atthe other control variables shows that neither GDP per capita nor thedemocratization index is significant in any of the models. They do notplay a relevant role in the diffusion process of the ratifications of C111.The fact that the cultural spheres network is not significant either fitsthe assumption that the convention was universally ratified by the mostdiverse member states. Overall, none of the networks examined havea significant influence across all models. Even the positively significantinfluence by the colonial legacies network on exposure becomes insignif-icant as soon as national covariates such as legal origin or the nationalequality index are included.6 Only the spatial proximity network has avery high positive effect, which unexpectedly becomes insignificant whenwe restrict the network to only include ILO members for which data onnational implementation of equality rights were also available. This isanother strong piece of evidence that mainly national characteristics ofthe member countries explain the ratification behavior. Further, Mossiget al. (2021, in this volume) have already pointed out that geographyshould not be considered directly as a stand-alone effect but always incombination with other linked indicators. Only when either durationmembership in the ILO, legal origin, the national equality index, orall national covariates together are taken into account (Models 2 and4) does the exposure through the proximity network acquire its signifi-cant positive and strong influence. At the same time, the analysis of the6 In addition, all calculations were also checked with a non-normalized colony network. Here,the value for the proximity network becomes slightly larger, but overall no significant differencescan be found based on the different modeling of the colony network. The non-normalizedregression results are in the Appendix.8 From Geneva to the World? … 217national covariates is very insightful. For example, the country-specificnational equality index is not significantly positive in the models whenaccounting for legal origin. The surprising result is that the national dejure status of national equality laws is not relevant for the exposure forratification of C111. In principle, this speaks for the universal characterof the convention, which should motivate countries to support the ideasof C111 through ratification, regardless of the level of development andimplementation of equivalent standards at the national level. However,it contradicts the common narrative that countries ratify conventionsprimarily when the implementation costs for them are particularly lowbecause they would not have to make major changes or adaptations tonational laws, for example.The strong effect of legal origins is unexpected. The reference categoryfor the values shown were countries with German legal origins. Onlya few countries in total belong to the Socialist legal origin and all ofthem in the sample have not ratified the convention, which explains themassive significant negative value for them. It is thus a methodologicaleffect. The significant negative value for countries with UK/CommonLaw legal origin stands out in particular but is not significant. Incontrast, the positively significant values for French and Scandinavianlegal origin, both renowned homelands of early equality efforts and insti-tutionalization, are unsurprising. It should also be remembered at thispoint that de jure data formed the basis of the analysis. These are andwere not always congruent with the de facto situation. The probabilityof C111 compared to the probability of members with German legalorigin is thus particularly high in countries with French legal origin andScandinavian legal origin.The duration membership in ILO shows a relatively small negativeeffect (close to 1). This indicates that if members do not adopt shortlyafter entry into ILO the chances of ratifying the convention later arereduced. Another explanation could be that older members are slower inratifying—which was shown already in Table 8.2. This could thereforebe a consequence of the norm cascade phase or even the internalizationstage according to Finnemore and Sikkink: newer members need to provethemselves and since it has become part of the global norm to ratifyC111, newer members never have a chance to NOT ratify.218 J. HahsThe results update and confirm previous research. Chau et al. (2001)did not find any significant peer effects on the probability of ratifica-tion for C111. Nevertheless, they also identified the legal system as arelevant factor in the likelihood of ratification. While they consideredthis to be the only factor, the present analysis now shows that regionalproximity and the duration of ILO membership are also relevant for theprobability of ratification. Schmitt et al. (2015) reported strong empir-ical support for the existence of regional diffusion processes in relationto social protection and the introduction of social security programs.The probability that a country introduced a social security programincreased if another country in the same geographical region had alreadyadopted such a scheme. At the same time, they found a clear influence ofILO membership on adoption. Third, colonial dummies indicated cleareffects that colonial heritage was important for consolidation. These lasttwo effects cannot be confirmed for the probability of adopting the C111antidiscrimination convention. Membership even has delaying effects onthe ratification. And effects of colonial legacy network are not robust andsignificant across models to exert consolidating effects.While for Chau the probability of ratification increases with time,this observation cannot be confirmed by the different networks. On thecontrary, the controlled time periods showed a negative effect. The lowimpact of network effects further confirms Sheppard’s (2015) legal anal-ysis and assessment that C111 was open enough for countries at differentstages of their membership to ratify national levels of antidiscriminationstandards.ConclusionThis paper tested the influence of four networks on the diffusion of rati-fications of C111 of the ILO. It was found that, with the exception ofthe geographical proximity network, the networks examined here do notplay a significant role as a pipeline for diffusion. At the same time, thesignificance of the geographical proximity network can only be meaning-fully interpreted in conjunction with other, in this case national, factors.The already weak influence of the colonial network also vanishes as soonas the national legal origin of the countries is included in the model.8 From Geneva to the World? … 219Despite legal origin, however, there is a proximity effect of the networksfor which diffusion processes could be demonstrated, though the mech-anism of this cannot be shown here. Further in-depth research is neededat this point.The influence of ILO membership slows down the effect of ratifica-tion more than it supports it. Surprisingly, the influence of the nationalde jure status of antidiscrimination rights is completely irrelevant. Thissupports a decoupling of transnational and national regulation in thefield of antidiscrimination rights and should be further investigated interms of the de-territorialization of labor law. Referring to the questionposed in the title of my contribution, this could indicate an initial butcautious “Yes, possibly from Geneva to the world.” To this end, it willalso be relevant to quantitatively analyze the interaction of C111 andthe UN human rights conventions ICERD and CEDAW—although thedescriptive analysis for the two relevant periods after adoption indicateslittle remarkable increase in ILO C111 ratifications. Further analysisshould also take into account spillover effects of the EU key directivesin gender equality and nondiscrimination. This concerns questions oflearning processes, for example between institutions with overlappingmembership.Overall, it must also be noted that domestic factors are mainly relevantfor the likelihood of ratifying C111. However, diffusion mechanismsother than these are also conceivable, which could be revealed by, forexample, further inclusion of states with populations below 500,000inhabitants and expansion through historically deep data across alldifferent networks.Further work on the topic should for example consider the interactioneffects of colonial legacy and legal origin in transnational antidiscrimi-nation law. The strong negative effect of common law legal origin onthe likelihood of ratification needs to be addressed in more depth. Simi-larly, it would be worthwhile to theorize the additional pipeline of IOmembership alluded to in the article and then methodologically incor-porate it into the model, for example, in the form of the UN, the ILOand the EU as networks in their own right. This would also come closestto the claim of examining diffusion not only in the form of convergencebut also as a process of interaction.220 J.

In 2020, itwas estimated that 4.5% of the US population identifies as LGBTQ+(Lesbian, Gay, Bi-, Transsexual, Queer, and other) (The Williams Insti-tute 2020). The public confusion over acronyms and pronouns goesso far that people ironically label the LGBTQ+ community “alphabetmafia” on social media platforms (Alphabet Mafia 2020).

Seitzerlanguage was implemented by the US government (Aldridge 2021),while at the same time, 54 countries were still criminalizing same-sexrelationships in 2019.2 Despite the rising global visibility and acceptanceof people breaking with binary gender stereotypes, sexual preferences,and the traditional ‘nuclear family’ constellations, there is still a large gapwhen it comes to integration of people from the LGBTQ+ communityinto everyday society.3 The community is not only facing difficulties intheir private lives, but also unfair treatment and discrimination in theworkplace. In 2017, over 20% of Americans who identify as part ofthe LGBTQ+ community, reported to have been discriminated againstin the workplace during the job application process. Other commonissues include missing out on promotions, not receiving equal pay, verbalabuse, and mistreatment through the courts. These discriminatory prac-tices nearly double if multiple disadvantages intersect, such as ethnicityor socioeconomic background (Casey et al. 2019). To ensure that allpeople, regardless of their sexual preferences, can participate equallyand discrimination-free in the labor market, some states have resortedto including the LGBTQ+ community in workplace antidiscriminationpolicies. However, this movement is a newer topic on states’ agendasand is progressing rather slowly, in addition, it is rarely discussed onthe international stage. While some states such as France, have intro-duced antidiscrimination policies on the basis of gender already in 1985,others are still hesitant. This chapter asks if transnational networksare contributing to the diffusion of antidiscrimination policies for theLGBTQ+ community by adding transnational pressure to inspire policyadoption, or if this policy type is more dependent on local conditions.For supporters of the LGBTQ+ community the need for politicalaction is undisputable. Adversaries, however, question, why the stateshould get involved in such a private matter. This question leads to thediscussion of a welfare states’ responsibilities. According to the Universal2 Own coding.3 In this chapter, the term “community” refers to people of the LGBTQ+ community, not onlynon-conforming regarding their own gender identity but also regarding their sexual orientation.Due to lack of data, the included legal regulations do not include relationships breaking withthe status of a nuclear (2-parent) family or include multiple consenting adults (polyamory). Inaddition, these regulations do not specifically mention transgender or transsexual people, butthe theoretical framing does include this group as well.9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 229Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (UN General Assembly 1948),the state has the responsibility to ensure, among other things, everypersons’ security, safety, and freedom, regardless of origin, race, sex orreligion. This includes, as many activists of the gay rights movementclaim (Velasco 2018), the freedom to choose one’s partner regardless ofgender. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and CulturalRights (ICESCR) (UN General Assembly 1966), signed by 171 coun-tries, goes even further by declaring, that a state’s responsibility includesensuring the right to be recognized “without discrimination of any kindas to race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion,national or social origin, property, birth or other status” (Article 2.2).Given the global acceptance of these sets of definitions and responsibil-ities, regulations ensuring the safety, well-being, and non-discriminationof the LGBTQ+ community should therefore be seen as a constitu-tive part of states’ welfare responsibilities, along with ensuring equalopportunities and economic security. Ensuring a safe, discrimination-freeworkplace is important for the livelihood of individuals and the commu-nity. Multiple institutions such as the International Labor Organization(ILO) are concerned with fostering the implementation of such policiesacross the globe.However, the reality of rights and protections for the LGBTQ+community looks very different. While the acceptance of LGBTQ+persons is slowly rising, the implementation of equal rights for couplesof the same gender as well as other family constellations aside from thenuclear 2-parent-1-child household is still very low. The implementationof protection laws is equally low in prevalence and similarly new, just asmarriage or civil union laws, as Fig. 9.1 shows. This chapter thereforeexplores how global and local conditions such as countries’ interdepen-dencies and national cultural values influence the diffusion of workplaceantidiscrimination regulations for the LGBTQ+ community.Setting up a TimelineTo put the adoption of antidiscrimination regulations as analyzed inthis chapter into perspective, it is helpful to set up a timeline of how230 H. SeitzerFig. 9.1 Cumulative adoption rates for LGBTQ+ rights and important datesLGBTQ+ issues progressed internationally over the years from local gayrights organizations to internationally celebrated pride. This explorationalready contains clues about the results of this chapters’ analyzes. Thistimeline not only includes important events leading up to the implemen-tation of antidiscrimination policies, but also discusses the progressionfrom criminalizing same-sex relationships to their acceptance in societyas a prerequisite to the implementation of antidiscrimination regulationsfor the community. Even though most societies today are open towardsthe LGBTQ+ community, discrimination against the community is stillan issue, as discussed previously.Throughout early human history, having relations with the same sexor not conforming to popular gender norms was very common (LGBTHistory 2021). But, with the rise of Christianity these relations beganto lose acceptance and were deemed “deviant” and criminal behavior.Especially with the rise of modern sciences, medical procedures, andpsychology, this oppression strengthened (Edsall 2003). The strugglefor the community to be allowed to openly express their personalityand sexuality in public developed different forms around the globe.The Scientific Humanitarian Committee was a Berlin-based organiza-tion, founded as early as 1897, which is generally accepted as the firstgay rights organization. Figure 9.1 shows that at this point in time,same-sex relationships were decriminalized in some countries, but it took9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 231considerably longer to include regulations for protection or even theimplementation of equal rights in marriage. Of course, this organiza-tion was shut down during the Nazi rule in 1933 and its memberssuffered greatly under the Nazi regime (Encarnación 2014). These topicsthen resurfaced in Europe again already in 1948 with the signing ofthe UDHR. This document, especially Article 2, granting the “rightsof freedom … without distinction of any kind, including sex”, has sincethen been used by activist groups to frame their arguments, declaring thechoice of partners and personal expression a human right (Encarnación2014). Interestingly, a study by Velasco (2018) showed, that increasedactivism for equality and human rights often coincides with increasedactivism for LGBTQ+ rights as well. The combining of forces for thesecauses can be controversial but, in some cases, also be beneficial for bothparties (Velasco 2018). While the acceptance of same-sex partnerships isa prerequisite for the implementation of any policy to protect LGBTQ+community members from discrimination, it is also important to notewhen antidiscrimination laws for the general population, regardless ofsexual preference, became important on the international stage.Therefore, another historical event to consider in this chapter is theratification of the ILO Discrimination (Employment and Occupation)Convention C111 (1958). This convention, which is ratified by 175countries worldwide, states in the Preamble, that.…all human beings, irrespective of race, creed or sex, have the right to pursueboth their material well-being and their spiritual development in condi-tions of freedom and dignity, of economic security and equal opportunity,and Considering further that discrimination constitutes a violation of rightsenunciated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights….Article (1a) states that “any distinction, exclusion or preference madeon the basis of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, nationalextraction or social origin” is to be considered as discrimination. Unfor-tunately, as statistics show, discrimination, in the workplace or elsewhere,on basis of sexual orientation is still a common occurrence in manystates. Even though there were many public transgressions to the generalnorm throughout history and a secret subculture existed in America and232 H. SeitzerEurope, it took until 1969 for the LGBTQ+ community in the US toopen the fight for their rights to a public, discrimination-free life as well(Edsall 2003). The Stonewall riots, a violent clash between police andpatrons of Stonewall Inn, a transvestite and gay bar in Manhattan, isnow considered the beginning of the open fight for LGBTQ+ rights, asthis clash was followed by the first gay pride parade in the world. Theopen fight for equal rights eventually led to the realization, that antidis-crimination regulations protecting the LGBTQ+ community, not onlyin the workplace, are a necessity to ensure the equal participation of thisgroup in the labor market and everyday life. Today, the fight for equalrights of the community often lies in the hands of local and interna-tional organizations (IOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)like the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Associa-tion (ILGA), which is considered the largest transnational IO advocatingfor LGBTQ+ rights today. Figure 9.1 shows the adoption rates for thedecriminalization of same-sex relationships, the adoption of antidiscrim-ination laws in the workplace, and the adoption rates for marriage orcivil union laws for same-sex couples. This timeline clearly demonstrateshow the acceptance of private relationships long preceded the acceptanceand support of antidiscrimination regulations and family units poten-tially involving children. It also establishes that in the past, local eventsseem to have been more prevalent in inspiring societal change, ratherthan international pressure influencing policies. Nevertheless, the effectof transnational influence cannot be dismissed.Due to the combination of these events, the political definition ofhuman rights in the UDHR, which was then followed by other publicevents and a global, political debate, the year 1948 will serve as a startingpoint for this analysis.Until 2010, 104 countries of the 164-country sample used in thischapter had actively removed laws previously criminalizing relationshipsamong people of the same gender, effectively making same-sex relation-ships legal. The societal acceptance thereof is a different story, but thisdiscussion would exceed the scope of this chapter. Only 5 countries inthe sample did not have any criminalization or decriminalization laws inplace, however, several countries such as Iraq did not have a specific crim-inalization law in place but are known to find other ways of enforcing9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 233norm digressions, or had laws limiting the freedom of expression ofpersons (Egypt) (Mendos et al. 2020). Others simply had never criminal-ized LGBTQ+ relationships, or there was no clear data found. In 2020,54 Countries still had active laws criminalizing LGBTQ+ relationshipsor limiting their freedom of expression. 66 countries had implementedregulations preventing discrimination at the workplace on basis of sexualorientation.The acceptance of relationships contrary to the common norm differssignificantly from the inclusion of the community in all aspects ofpublic life. The legalization or decriminalization of same-sex relationshipsstarted much earlier than the adoption of laws giving the communitythe same rights as everyone else, as Fig. 9.1 shows (Encarnación 2014).In addition, there are considerable differences in local and nationalregulations. For example, Wisconsin was the first US state to bandiscrimination based on sexual orientation in both public and privatesector employment in 1982, but the regulation was only implementedin 2020 on the national level (Johnson 2016). France, on the otherhand, banned discrimination based on sexual orientation already in1985 for the entire country. While antidiscrimination regulations aremaking strong progress, equal marriage rights are only slowly being intro-duced. Adoption rights are lagging still further behind. This shows thatparticipation in the workplace might be considered a more importantaspect to ensure than those allowing the socialization of children bysame-sex couples, as this goes along with the impression of fosteringnon-traditional families and decay in Christian morals.This global divergence in adoption of rights for the LGBTQ+community begs the question of why some countries try to ensure adiscrimination-free workplace and “fulfillment of citizen duties” (e.g.,contributing to the economy) regardless of sexual orientation whileothers do not. Previous research has found various reasons, local condi-tions such as activism, urbanization, religiosity but also internationalproblem pressure (e.g., Ayoub and Page 2020; Ayoub 2015; Colvin2004). This problem pressure can be administered through IOs andother advocacy groups, but also other policymakers, which then ulti-mately leads to policy diffusion. While policy diffusion, local culture,234 H. Seitzerand religion have been a part of previous research on the topic, the inclu-sion of additional networks such as trade, has not been considered yet.This chapter therefore intends to fill this gap.When looking at the statistics but also the declarations and regula-tions presented above, one immediately wonders what other global orlocal factors might drive the introduction of rights and policies for theLGBTQ+ community, and what players or factors are preventing it. Thischapter therefore sets out to explore different networks of policy diffu-sion. Do transnational trade networks, spatial proximity, colonial ties andcultural similarities have an impact on the diffusion of workplace antidis-crimination regulations for the LGBTQ+ community? Or do domesticfactors have a stronger impact on the implementation of these policies,indicating no norm diffusion regarding this policy? The policies includeall regulations prohibiting discrimination in the workplace due to sexualpreference and expression.In the following section, I will clarify my theoretical approach andcontextualize the chapter with previous research. I will then discuss themethodology and data used and then discuss the results, conclusion, andlimitations of this analysis.TheoryPolicy diffusion has multiple explanatory mechanisms through whichpolicies travel from one country to another, namely learning, compe-tition, imitation, or coercion (Dobbin et al. 2007). All the mechanismsshare the commonality that policies are traveling from one country toanother through a connection between them. This could be a colonialrelationship, resulting in a coercive diffusion; a trade network resultingin competition; or simply communication through either unneighborlyrelations or general interactions between policymakers and advocates, orIO membership, fostering policy learning. The mechanism at work hereis “contagion”: if a country has adopted a norm, all countries tied to thiscountry are exposed to this fact and their risk of adoption increases ifthe policy is contagious. The more countries are embedded into different9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 235networks, the more likely they are to adopt policies similar to networkpartners’ (Boli and Thomas 1999).A common theoretical approach to this is Meyer and colleagues’world society theory (Meyer et al. 1997). According to this theoret-ical approach, countries and policymakers draw from a common set ofaccepted norms and ideas about social policies and rights, such as theconstruct of democracy or human rights, for policy inspiration. Throughnetworks of interaction, such as trade, simple spatial proximity, sharedIO membership, or colonialism, the members of world society exchangeinformation which ultimately allows for policy diffusion. The membersof world society also hold each other accountable for adhering to thesecommonly accepted standards. Consequently, the adoption of these stan-dards can allow countries to legitimize themselves and “put themselves onthe map.” To conclude, countries care about their image and reputationon the world stage and new adopters are implementing policies whenunder pressure to do so. In addition, if these norms are not adopted,punitive action can occur. Thus, through this framework, the interna-tional community is said to enforce the diffusion of these standards tothe point where this development seems inevitable. The increase in expo-sure through different networks and IOs results in a deeper embeddingin world society and increases the risk of adoption (Velasco 2020b; Boliand Thomas 1999).While the networks of world society lead to the diffusion of norms,which norms are diffusing can be explained by neoinstitutionalist theory.According to this theoretical strand, international organizations as ratio-nalized others develop and implement norms and values in world society,resulting in an increasing isomorphism of different institutions aroundthe globe. Most of these norms are based on rational arguments basedon increasing efficiency. Antidiscrimination policies increase the partic-ipation and therefore also productivity of the LGBTQ+ community,effectively improving citizens’ labor market participation and a coun-tries’ economic productivity (Dobbin et al. 2007). Therefore, especiallycountries based on neoliberal values could be expected to implementantidiscrimination policies for the LGBTQ+ community so as notto prevent a large portion of society from contributing to economicproductivity.236 H. SeitzerHowever, this is not always the case. In fact, with issues such asLGBTQ+ rights the increased pressure through world society mighteven invoke an adverse reaction (Rahman 2014). Studies have foundthat while there is a positive change in attitudes toward homosexu-ality in general due to the work of IOs and world society, the gapbetween liberal, more religious societies has widened (Roberts 2019;Ayoub and Page 2020; Ayoub 2015). In fact, the framing of LGBTQ+rights as “foreign values” from the West is not uncommon. Ironically,some African countries criminalizing LGBTQ+ relationships do so indirect reference to their British colonial heritage—a Western influence(Encarnación 2014). Interestingly, shaming through world society dueto non-compliance might even support the resistance to these norms, ifthe local societal situation does not agree with the international norm—as it is often the case in religious communities or countries. In fact, ifcountries do not have an internal motivation to implement these norms,resistance to shaming might even legitimize legislators in the eyes oftheir local population (Terman 2019). Nevertheless, it seems as if worldsociety has some effect on the introduction of LGBTQ+ policies, as doesculture, just maybe not exclusively in a positive direction. Therefore, Iconsider different networks of possible policy diffusion, as mentionedbefore, along with several local conditions as control variables to test ifworkplace antidiscrimination laws diffuse through the “usual” channelsor if there are other mechanisms at play.Previous ResearchThere is a surprisingly large body of literature on LGBTQ+ policies avail-able—considering the novelty of the issue. But many of these studiesfocus on the implementation of different regulations or bans in indi-vidual countries, or societal acceptance or rejection of LGBTQ+ issues,instead of policy development and diffusion. Interestingly, a large bodyof these studies is focused on the United States; fewer studies provide aglobal perspective. Nevertheless, there are several studies relevant to thischapter. Many studies identify local cultural characteristics as definingfactors.9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 237Johnson (2016) found that the lack of national pressure, combinedwith an active LGBTQ+ community, results in a federal instead ofnational implementation of policies for the community. In addition, thepresence of an active group advocating for gender and racial equalitypositively contributes to the introduction of LGBTQ+ policies. In asimilar perspective, more women in parliament tends to increase thenumber of social welfare policies and therefore positively influence theintroduction of LGBTQ+ policies as well (Velasco 2018). Based on theseresults, a gender equality index was integrated into the analysis of thischapter to control for the local culture and perspective on women.Another study on the implementation of LGBTQ+ rights, especiallyin the workplace, states as well that internal activism, even thoughnot necessarily visible to the outside world, is the driving force behindantidiscrimination regulations in Fortune 1000 companies. However, theauthor also states that without the cultural capacity to allow such a“transgression” against traditional norms, activism would not be possiblein the first place (Raeburn 2004).Although a lot of evidence points to the influence of local culture andconditions on the introduction of these policies, it has to be mentionedthat the internal pressure to implement these policies is often higher inindustrialized, urban regions due to the higher chances of a more diversecommunity (Colvin 2004).According to Taylor and colleagues (2012) the risk of adoption ofLGBTQ+ as well as transgender rights also depends highly on the specificsubject of the policy: While regulations providing antidiscriminationprotections on the basis of sexual orientation are highly dependent oninternal political factors such as the capacity and use of local initia-tives, education rate, and a divided government; for gender identityissues, this is not the case. The authors add that even though there areno clear diffusion pathways discernible, the isomorphism they foundbetween countries is suspicious and does hint toward a world societymodel of policy diffusion. Another indicator supporting the influence ofworld society has been found by Fernández and Lutter (2013) as well.This study finds that political, secular-rational values as well as socioe-conomic factors drive the implementation of these policies, aside fromworld society ties. World society ties are here defined as membership238 H. Seitzerin different IOs and ratified human rights treaties. Interesting in thisstudy is the positive effect of domestic cultural, rational values. Theseresults indicate that not only are local cultural conditions such as femaleempowerment, activism , and economic factors influencing the imple-mentation of these policies, but also ties through shared IO membershipand shared perspectives on human rights.Despite these studies showing the increase of LGBTQ+ protectionregulations, several studies have found that with growing advocacygroups and international visibility, the resistance to implement thesenorms is also growing. Outside the West, resistance of local LGBTQ+groups is rising, which becomes visible through disagreements with theinternational norm, as well as activism groups, especially human rightsorganizations, not wanting their arguments to be “hijacked” (“gay rightsare human rights”). This can put pressure on local lawmakers to preventthe implementation of LGBTQ+ rights (Velasco 2018). Rahman (2014)also points out, that in many countries not classified as “the West,” theinternational pressure to implement legal regulations which were previ-ously implemented in the West can lead to what the author calls a“homocolonialist” perspective. The resistance to these laws has less todo with the subject itself, but rather with the opposition to the West,especially if the invoked Western exceptionalism fosters a confronta-tional, hierarchical relationship between countries, where not adoptingthese norms is not only seen as “trailing behind” but even as “infe-rior.” Thus, when the international pressure to implement LGBTQ+ lawsdoes not respect individual societal backgrounds and instead antagonizessociety and lawmakers alike, even shaming the country internationally,this pressure can lead to an oppositional action (Terman 2019).As these studies show, there are many local but also transnationalconditions fostering the implementation of LGBTQ+ policies. A newfactor in this chapter is the use of exposure to countries with sharedcultural characteristics as a transnational network of influence. Arelawmakers only responding to local cultural conditions or are they alsoreacting to actions of lawmakers in countries with a similar culturalprofile? Based on these results, the following aspects are considered inthis analysis: aside from a network of cultural similarity, colonial ties,spatial proximity, and trade, several societal conditions were included:9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 239a gender equality index as well as the ratification of the ILO conven-tion C111 against discrimination, GDP per capita and a democratizationindex. Furthermore, as a proxy for embeddedness in world culture, theindegree of the trade network is used. Trade openness (Busemeyer 2009)was tested for, but not included.Data andMethodsThe chapter analyzes predictors influencing the introduction and diffu-sion of workplace antidiscrimination laws for the LGBTQ+ communityfrom 1949 until 2010 for N = 164 countries. The data was collectedfrom the ILGA reports on State-Sponsored Homophobia (e.g., Mendoset al. 2020). These regulations include all acts or laws that prohibitdiscrimination based on sexual orientation, even if this stipulation is oneof several mentioned in the act. For example, New Zealand includedsexual orientation for the first time in 1993: Section 21(1)(m) of theHuman Rights Act names sexual orientation among the prohibitedgrounds of discrimination. Article 22 of this act prohibits discrimina-tion in employment, thereby covering discrimination in employmentbased on sexual orientation. This regulation was then revised and in2000, Article 105(1)(m) of the Employment Relations Act specificallyprohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. Inmany cases, acts were vague at first, only covering sexual orientationand gender identity was added later on. France for example, namedsexual orientation in 1985 as grounds protected against discriminationunder the Labour Code and in 2008, gender identity was included. Allfirst mentions of protection against discrimination or equal treatment inoccupation, workplace, trade, or profession with regards to sexual pref-erence or orientation were included. If sexual orientation was includedas an amendment, the date of amendment was set as the introduction.Introductions were only coded if the regulation was introduced for theentire state. In cases like the United States, for example, some localstates introduced antidiscrimination laws much earlier than the federallevel: The District of Columbia covered sexual orientation already in240 H. Seitzer1973 (D.C. Code § 2–1402.11),4 but it was only included in federallegislation in 2020. In this case, the federal regulation was coded.The networks on shared cultural characteristics (or cultural spheres),which are considered of special interest in this chapter, include indica-tors of political liberties, rule of law, gender roles, dominant religion,language group, government ideology, classification of civilization, andcolonial past (Besche-Truthe et al. 2020). In addition, a network oftrade (Barbieri and Keshk 2016), colonial relationships (Becker, 2019enriched with Head and Mayer, 2014; and our own data collectionusing Wikipedia), and spatial proximity (Eiser et al. 2020) is consideredto potentially influence the diffusion process (see Mossig et al. 2021,in this volume, for a detailed description of the data and procedure).Aside from the network exposure, several indicators were included: Thedegree of trade, describing the number of trade ties a country has inany given year as indicator for a countries’ embeddedness into a glob-alized world. More ties in trade could indicate a deeper embeddednessin world society and therefore a stronger pressure to implement antidis-crimination regulations. This indicator is not to be confused with a tradeopenness measure (Busemeyer 2009), which was tested but not signifi-cant. Additionally, GDP per capita (Inklaar et al. 2018) was controlledfor, missing data on this indicator was interpolated with a logistic func-tion to account for the nonlinear rise of GDP. Further, the democracyindex from the V-Dem Project (Lührmann et al. 2018) was included.Missing data points were interpolated linearly. These indicators allowtesting for the influence of economic situation as well as political regime.Also, a historical gender equality index was included, to account forlocal awareness of equality and potential activism (Dilli et al. 2019). Themissing time points were interpolated linearly as well. Finally, the ratifi-cation of the ILO Discrimination (Labour and Occupation) ConventionC111 regarding antidiscrimination was controlled to identify if the ratifi-cation of a general agreement regarding antidiscrimination irrespective ofsexual orientation, had an influence on the adoption of this more specific4 https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/2-1402.11.html.9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 241antidiscrimination regulation (data collected by Hahs, Chapter 8 in thisvolume). This influence has not been tested in other studies before. Thediffusion of the ratification of this ILO convention is analyzed in thisvolume as well, further information can be found in Chapter 8 by Hahs.For the analysis the R package netdiffuseR (Vega Yon and Valente2020) was used. Exposure is defined as the share of j adopters in theego-centered network of node i (i \u0002= j ) at time t. Exposure is set toinfluence the adoption rate between t and t + 1 (Valente 1995). If allcountries, one specific country (ego) is connected to have implementedthe policy before ego, exposure is 1. If none have adopted, exposure is 0(see Mossig et al. 2021, in this volume, for details of these concepts). Theweighted exposure term is then used in a discrete-time logistic-hazardmodel to predict its influence on the introduction probability of thedependent variable. Once a country has introduced the policy, it leavesthe risk set. Introductions after 2010 are right-censored. The standarderrors were corrected with a clustering indicator for historically depen-dent units, such as the former Yugoslavia, which could introduce a policyfor multiple modern political entities at once. The logistic hazard modelis only estimated for the years 1949 until 2010, as antidiscriminationonly came onto the international agenda in 1948 with the signing of theUHDR. As mentioned previously, this is because this convention is oftenused to argue for the introduction of antidiscrimination regulations andis therefore seen as the starting date for the public and political debateabout antidiscrimination laws. The effects are displayed in hazard ratios,coefficients greater than 1 denote a positive effect, coefficients smallerthan 1 denote a negative effect.ResultsFigure 9.2 shows a world map of the diffusion of antidiscriminationpolicies for the LGBTQ+ community. The figure demonstrates that thispolicy is a new topic and has made significant changes in the last fewyears, especially after 2010. Most policy fields included in this volumehave an “epicenter” of policy origin, in this case, it is European and otherEnglish-speaking countries.242 H.

Interestingly, the signing of the ILO conventionC111 regarding antidiscrimination does not have a significant effect onthe introduction of antidiscrimination laws for the protection of theLGBTQ+ community. The gender equality index is significant and posi-tive as well, denoting that countries with more women in power, in theworkplace, and involved in public life, are more likely to also introduce244 H. Seitzerantidiscrimination laws to protect LGBTQ+ people in the labor forceThis is in line with findings from Velasco (2018) and others, showingthat in general, a higher prevalence of women’s rights activism and publicparticipation in a country has positive effects on LGBTQ+ rights andrepresentations.Another interesting result is the degree effect of the trade network,showing the effect of a larger number of trade partners on the risk ofadopting policies regardless of exposure to already “infected” countries.Countries with more ties in trade have a higher risk of implementingthese regulations. In terms of exposure through the networks, we can seethat the exposure effect through the cultural spheres network convergestoward 0—in hazard ratios, this is a large negative effect. The effectis statistically significant. The negative sign is an initially counterintu-itive result. Similarly, ties based on colonial relationships have a negative,significant effect on a normalized model. The exposure through theseparticular networks slows the diffusion process down or even preventsit. The exposure through the trade network is insignificant and posi-tive, but also incredibly large. To test if the trade embeddedness effectcould be representative for trade openness (total trade/GDP; Busemeyer2009), this effect was tested as well, but was not significant.6 The pseudo-R-square measure by McKelvey and Zavoina (1975) however indicatesthat the trade embeddedness effect contributes significantly to the modelfit, as it improves from 0.74 to 0.83 with the inclusion of the tradedegree effect. Spatial proximity has no significant effect. To take differentmethods of calculating exposure into account, the exposure calculationfor the colonial ties network was changed to represent a non-normalizedcoefficient (the exposure effect reduces over time instead of remainingstable after decolonization). This model can be found in the appendix.Although the colonial ties network loses its significance, the effect direc-tions and sizes of all other coefficients remain relatively stable, supportingthe findings.6 Model not shown.9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 245As a result, I therefore conclude that (1) the cultural spheres networkdoes not aid in the diffusion of antidiscrimination laws. While the influ-ence of exposure through the cultural spheres network is significant, theeffect is negative. It therefore seems to hinder diffusion instead. However,while cultural similarity seems to halt the diffusion. (2) Being embeddedin a trade network has a positive effect, regardless of previous adoptionsthrough other countries. And (3) domestic factors are the main driversof this policy type. As gender equality and democratization index havesuch strong positive effects, the influence of local culture is undeniable.However, this instance seems to depend on the local problem pressureand situation and much less on transnational pressure. The internationalcommunity of world society does not seem to influence the diffusionof this type of policy, rather, it seems to slow the diffusion down. Thisfinding might hint towards a similar mechanism as discussed by Terman(2019), according to whom global pressure and a mismatch to localconditions can hinder the implementation of these policies. The frequentinteraction with other countries through trade does have some effect, butit does not justify a diffusion model in the classical sense.Conclusion & DiscussionIn this chapter, I have examined the diffusion of antidiscriminationregulations in the workplace for the LGBTQ+ community. I havetested the influence of exposure through networks of cultural simi-larity, colonial past, trade, and spatial proximity. In addition, I testedthe influence of domestic conditions, such as GDP per capita, genderequality, democracy, and the ratification of the ILO’s C111 conventionfor antidiscrimination (ILO 1958).The results are somewhat expected and in line with previous research,but also interesting, especially regarding the influence of culture.Domestic factors, mainly the democratization index and the genderequality index have a very strong positive impact on the introduc-tion of antidiscrimination regulations. Countries with women in power246 H. Seitzerand active in public life are more likely to implement antidiscrimina-tion regulations for the community. This is not surprising, as previousresearch has found this association as well (Johnson 2016; Velasco 2018).Interestingly, the ratification of the ILO’s C111 convention did not haveany significant effect, a result counterintuitive to the common line ofargumentation in previous research that international organizations drivethe diffusion of this policy type. On the other hand, the ratificationof this policy might as well be “myth and ceremony” to appease worldsociety, while being not implemented on a local level (Meyer and Rowan1977). In addition, the organizations credited with success for the imple-mentation of policies supporting the LGBTQ+ community are usuallytopic-specific and very active on a local level, in contrast to the transna-tional scope of the ILO (Velasco 2018). A country’s embeddedness in theglobalized world through the trade network also has a positive impact.Trade with many different countries might go along with a certain levelof openness. This effect is not to be confused with the classical measuresfor trade openness, the proportion of trade on GDP, which was notsignificant in this analysis. The important aspect for this measurement isthen the number of ties, rather than the percentage of trade on nationalGDP. This effect might be spurious, as Western, industrialized, English-speaking countries, who tend to trade more than most other countries,have already adopted the policy, as Fig. 9.2 suggests. This supports thesuspicion that this policy does not diffuse via the expected pathway—if atall—and relies more on domestic factors. The most interesting result ofthe analysis is the negative effect of the cultural spheres network. Coun-tries sharing cultural characteristics do not cause contagion, in contrast,it slows the diffusion down. However, this might be the case for onlysome countries: Fig. 9.2 indicates, in contrast to the analysis results, thatlanguage, and therefore one aspect of cultural similarity as measured inthe network, seems to be an influence on the adoption of antidiscrim-ination policies. My suspicion therefore is that culture does matter inthe implementation of this policy, however, it might only be a positiveinfluence for some cultural spheres, while hindering diffusion in others.9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 247Aside from the effect of trade, none of the exposure terms were posi-tive. This leads to the conclusion that this type of policy does not diffusethrough networks of shared cultural characteristics or similarity, at leastnot for all cultural spheres. The negative exposure term of culture canalso be explained by adverse effects through shaming (Terman 2019)and a polarization to the Western “homocolonialist” agenda, as Rahmandescribed it (2014). The results are in line with previous studies high-lighting the importance of local activism and local problem pressure toimplement LGBTQ+ protection policies. It seems that this specific policydoes not follow the “usual” social policy diffusion pathways, but dependson local conditions, such as societal values instead of global influence.LimitationsAs with any other study, this analysis has limitations. The missing datafor GDP per capita had to be interpolated. Additionally, the oil crisis in1973 led to a very sharp increase in GDP per capita for Kuwait, Qatar,Norway, and the United Arab Emirates, resulting in outliers potentiallyinfluencing the analysis—even though this data is not a measurementerror. Additionally, the gender equality index had to be interpolated aswell, as this indicator ends in 2003. Second, the starting point of thelogistic hazard model is chosen somewhat arbitrarily, as countries wereat ‘risk’ of implementing these policies far before 1949. The changes tothis policy in the last 10 years were drastic and an expansion of the datais planned. The use of discrete-time points is another limitation here;however, the model fit did not significantly change with the use of time asa linear predictor.7 Furthermore, the particularities of modelling longitu-dinal analyses with a changing country sample for the same geographicalarea have to be kept in mind. It would be beneficial to include IOor NGO networks into this analysis, as they are potentially strongerdrivers for this policy than the included networks, as research shows7 Model not shown.248 H. Seitzer(e.g., Velasco 2020a), but the interaction between the present networksand IO membership is left for future research to discover. In addition,measures for local activism and interest groups could also shed more lighton the implementation of these policies. Culture as a predictor of thispolicy is irrefutable, but there might be conflicting aspects of culture notclearly distinguishable with the cultural spheres network. As mentionedbefore, certain religious orientations are a counterproductive character-istic (Rahman 2014), but have been combined into the network withother characteristics such as government ideology, resulting in the aboveeffects. In addition, it has to be mentioned that world society modelscan only provide limited explanations in some cases, as they do not fullyaccount for prolonged adverse effects of exposure. Previous studies couldshow that controversial issues such as LGBTQ+ rights might not be fullycaptured through this theoretical framing, as norms in society have to beshared, but the pressure through this model mainly rests on policymakers(Velasco 2020b). Roberts (2019) suggests the use of multiple moderni-ties theory instead to take a closer look at culture-specific attitudes andreactions to international pressure. Despite these limitations, I feel thatthe model presented here still shows interesting results, as they revealthe strong influence of local conditions over the networks, and the nega-tive effect of cultural similarity, pointing toward different mechanisms ofpolicy diffusion in contrast to other studies in this volume, dependingon the specific policy.AppendixSee Table (9.2)9 The Diffusion of Workplace Antidiscrimination Regulations … 249Table 9.2 The introduction of workplace antidiscrimination regulations, N =126 countries, 1949–2010 non-normalized colonial networkIntroduction of workplaceantidiscrimination laws(1) (2) (3) (4)> 1995 0.000*** 0.000*** 0.000*** 0.000***1995–2003 0.000*** 0.000*** 0.000*** 0.000***2004–2010 0.000*** 0.000*** 0.000*** 0.000***GDP per capita/10000USD1.170 1.183 1.260 1.226democratization 1.699*** 1.678*** 1.870*** 1.898**ratification of ILOconvention C-1113.507 3.596 3.063 3.063gender equality index 1.139*** 1.134*** 1.144*** 1.143***degree trade network 1.025* 1.022+ 1.030* 1.027+cultural spheres net.: w.exposure (lag 1 year)0.011* 0.011* 0.0004** 0.0003**colonies net.: w. exposurenon-normalized0.233 0.166 0.199trade net.: w. exposure(lag 1 year)123.221 45.839spatial proximity net.: w.exposure (lag 1 year)4.486Observations 7448 7448 7448 7448Log Likelihood −150.315 −149.912 −148.423 −148.229Akaike Inf.

All chapters have applied a uniform methodolog-ical approach that enables a comparison of social policy dynamics andan evaluation of the importance of different networks over time as wellas across different social policy fields.The Diffusion of Social Policies AroundtheWorldFigure 10.1 illustrates the spread of the ten social policies analyzed in theprevious chapters. While the x-axis shows the year of program adoption,the y-axis depicts the cumulative number of countries on a global scalethat has introduced the respective social policy. For many programs, thespread of social policies follows an S-curve which is indicative of policydiffusion. It is striking, however, that the diffusion processes differ greatlyFig. 10.1 The introduction of ten social policies around the world10 Critical Summary and Concluding Remarks 257between the individual programs in terms of timing, adoption rate, andspeed. For example, while the introduction of compulsory educationand work injury schemes started relatively early, the diffusion of familypolicies began at a much later stage. Moreover, there is a remarkablevariation in the number of countries that have adopted the respectivepolicy. Today, almost all countries worldwide have established health caresystems, compulsory education, work injury programs as well as paidmaternity leave, and antidiscrimination regulations regarding employ-ment and occupation. By contrast, long-term care, child benefits, andworkplace childcare as well as adult basic education and LGBTQ+ poli-cies are far less common. With regard to the speed of introduction, workinjury schemes, health care systems, and paid maternity leave spreadmuch more rapidly than compulsory education. In the case of the morerecent social policies, the figure suggests that labor-related programs suchas the ratification of the ILO antidiscrimination convention or adultbasic education spread faster than family and long-term care policies.Table 10.1 supports this pattern. For example, the average adoptionyear for workers’ compensation schemes is 1932, compared to 1991Table 10.1 The spread of social policies around the globeSocial policy field n Adoption rate Min Mean Median SdWork injury 159 0.97 1854 1932 1928 26.1ILO Convention 156 0.95 1959 1979 1975 17.0Health caresystem161 0.98 1883 1953 1958 31.9Long-term care 48 0.29 1948 1991 1995 17.6Compulsoryeducation154 0.94 1739 1927 1925 56.5Adult basiceducation130 0.79 1921 1986 1991 19.4AntidiscrimationLGBTQ+66 0.40 1985 2005 2005 7.6Paid maternityleave153 0.93 1884 1948 1952 26.7Child benefits 90 0.55 1926 1956 1950 21.8WorkplaceChildcare98 0.60 1902 1951 1952 25.5Notes n = Number of countries with the respective program in place; adoptionrate = n/ 164; min= first year of introduction, sd = standard deviation258 C. Schmitt and H. Obingerfor long-term care. The adoption rate, i.e., the proportion of countrieswith the respective social policy in place in relation to all countries, alsoreflects significant differences across various programs. While the adop-tion rate for work injury, health care systems, the ratification of the ILO’santidiscrimination directive, and maternity protection is over 0.9, thevalues for long-term care and child benefits are significantly lower. Inter-estingly, the standard deviation of the year of introduction of compulsoryeducation is high compared to all other policies, indicating that here thediffusion process lasted much longer than with all other programs.Figure 10.2 shows the timing of the inaugural legislation of fourmajor social security programs, namely, work injury schemes, health caresystems, compulsory education, and paid maternity leave.Figure 10.2 illustrates marked cross-regional and program-relateddifferences. While European countries, Russia (Soviet Union), and LatinAmerican countries introduced all four policies relatively early, the vastmajority of African states adopted social policy programs comparably lateor not at all yet. The countries in North America, notably the UnitedStates, clearly deviate from the overall pattern in the Global north.The Influence of Networks on the Diffusionof Social PoliciesAll chapters in this volume have analyzed the influence of the same set ofnetworks for explaining the diffusion of different social policies. Specif-ically, the importance of cultural, colonial, and trade relations is testedand contrasted with the effects of a network capturing geographical prox-imity. The overall findings reveal that the importance of internationallinkages captured by different network types is not homogeneous acrossthe social policies examined. For example, Chapter 2 has shown that thenetwork of spatial proximity is significant for understanding the intro-duction of work injury schemes. In the case of compulsory education(see Chapter 3), cultural linkages seem to have some effect on policydiffusion (at least when spatial proximity is not controlled for).Interestingly, neither colonial ties nor trade relations have been iden-tified in these chapters as important explanatory factors. By contrast,10 Critical Summary and Concluding Remarks 259(a) Work Injury Systems  (b) Health Care SystemsFig. 10.2 The introduction of four basic social policies by regions. a Work InjurySystems. b Health Care Systems. c Paid Maternity Leave. d Compulsory Education260 C.

It is argued in that chapter that the importance of10 Critical Summary and Concluding Remarks 261colonial linkages can be attributed to coercive diffusion, as the USSRimposed this policy on its satellite states. In the case of health caresystems (see Chapter 5), the authors conclude that health care systemsare more likely to have been introduced in earlier periods in affluentcountries connected by close trade relations. Later on, other factors likenation-building processes in former colonies gained importance. Whilealso geographical proximity was important, colonial ties did not seem toplay a role for legislative activities in this field. With regard to long-termcare (see Chapter 6), geographical proximity turned out to be the mostrelevant network driving the international proliferation of this program.In the case of paid maternity leave (see Chapter 7), program adop-tion is influenced by continuous advocacy as well as technical assistanceprovided by the ILO.By contrast, workplace childcare facilities are shaped by colonialties. More specifically, workplace childcare regulations were particularlywidespread in former French colonies. Chapter 8, which analyzes theratification of ILO’s antidiscrimination convention from 1958, onlyfinds evidence for the relevance of geographical proximity. All othernetworks play a minor role in the diffusion process. With regard toLGBTQ+ policies, diffusion seems to be driven to some extent by traderelations with other countries. Interestingly, the effect of cultural sphereshas even been identified as negative (see Chapter 9).Apart from the various international linkages that swayed the spreadof social policies, domestic factors also have to be examined. Democ-ratization processes have been identified as a key driving factor for theintroduction of work injury programs, long-term care, and the adop-tion of LGBTQ+ antidiscrimination policies. In the case of the latterthe state of gender equality at the domestic level increased the proba-bility of a country enacting antidiscrimination policies. In addition, stateformation is crucial for the adoption of work injury programs, whilefamily allowances are spurred by low fertility levels. The introductionof long-term care has mostly been a reaction to population aging andstrong political and social participation of women in the respective coun-tries, while economic prosperity was important for the early introductionof health care systems. Lastly, the ratification of the ILO’s discrimina-tion convention is highly influenced by the legal origin of a country,particularly the French legal tradition.262 C. Schmitt and H. ObingerTo summarize, this book contributes to the literature in the followingrespects. Firstly, several social policies and different types of networkswere considered simultaneously. This allows us to study and compareprogram-related policy diffusion and to evaluate the importance ofdifferent types of international and transnational relations for socialprotection legislation. The findings suggest that spatial proximity is themost relevant network in this regard. Geographical proximity impliesstrong international linkages in many respects such as cross-bordermigration, cultural ties, and trade relations. Moreover, all these linkagesare indicative of intensive cross-border communication, which is widelyseen as a main prerequisite for policy diffusion.Secondly, all individual chapters show that it is the interplay betweeninternational interdependencies and national factors that explains theadoption and spread of social policies. In terms of domestic determi-nants, the results presented in the book chapters suggest that democ-ratization processes are of central importance. Interestingly, the resultsfor economic variables such as economic prosperity are very heteroge-neous, indicating that the diffusion of social policies does not followthe linear logic emphasized by modernization theory (Wilensky 1975).Rather, in line with the findings by Collier and Messick (1975), it seemsthat economic development is only relevant in the early stages of programadoption, while at later stages international factors such as internationalorganizations or horizontal diffusion between states become increasinglyimportant.Lastly, the book analyzes the diffusion of social policies for a globalsample and thus overcomes the bias towards OECD countries that istypical for the vast majority of the pertinent literature. Existing researchnot only focuses on the spread of policies within the OECD world, butoften also restricts the analysis of international interdependencies to rela-tionships between Western countries. However, policymaking in OECDcountries as well as elsewhere is shaped by global economic relations,cultural and colonial ties linking countries across regions and conti-nents (Schmitt et al. 2015; Schmitt 2020). It is necessary to take allinterdependencies into account that have relevance to a specific nationalpolicymaking process.10 Critical Summary and Concluding Remarks 263Critical OutlookWhile some key challenges in the diffusion literature have been addressedin this volume, the approach suggested here also has its limits. Addressingthem opens up promising avenues for further research.To begin with, several chapters have shown that geographical prox-imity is the most relevant network for understanding welfare legislation.However, the advantage, mentioned above, that spatial proximity is astrong indication for the relevance of international relationships, is alsoits disadvantage, as it subsumes many different types of interdependen-cies. Spatial proximity is a catch-all indicator comprising cultural ties,close communication or important trade relations between neighboringcountries. Disentangling these overlapping linkages that are altogetherreflected by spatial proximity is a major challenge for further studies.Moreover, actors have not been considered in this volume. Thisis problematic as neither communication nor the transmission andprocessing of information is possible without agency. A promising nextstep towards a more comprehensive understanding of diffusion processeswould be to directly measure cross-border communication or informa-tion exchange between actors, rather than extrapolating the intensityof cross-border communication from cultural, spatial, and economicrelationships between states.In this volume, the relevance of four different networks, i.e., cultural,colonial, economic relations as well as geographical proximity betweencountries was tested. However, countries are connected with each othervia more than these four networks. Important networks not consideredhere are, for example, constituted by migration or communication flows.However, as the chapters cover a long time span stretching from the latenineteenth century to the present, the possibility of integrating thesenetworks is limited, because bilateral and dyadic information for theformative period of the welfare state is scarce. Collecting further networkinformation from earlier periods would be a promising avenue to cometowards a more comprehensive understanding of long-term social policydiffusion.A further problem refers to data quality, which is likely to vary greatlyacross the long time periods considered in this book. It is plausible that264 C. Schmitt and H. Obingerthe quality of data for the formative period of social policy in the latenineteenth century is much lower compared to that of contemporarydata.In the diffusion literature, several mechanisms underlying diffusionprocesses such as learning, imitation, coercion, and competition arediscussed (Simmons et al. 2008; Simmons and Elkins 2004). However,it is very difficult—if not impossible, especially for macro-quantitativestudies—to identify which diffusion mechanism ultimately gave riseto policy diffusion, as many of these mechanisms clearly overlap. Forexample, learning and emulation are closely connected and hard to sepa-rate from each other. Do governments really get a better understandingof the causal mechanisms between policies and outcomes from expe-riences made by other countries, or do they simply comply with thepolicies adopted in a particular peer group for symbolic reasons? Toanswer this question we need theoretical clarifications as well as alter-native methodological tools that allow us to distinguish between thedifferent mechanisms underlying policy diffusion (Obinger et al. 2013).Moreover, the analysis of the impact of international interdependen-cies and networks on domestic social policy dynamics is restricted to theadoption of similar policies. However, it is also possible that governmentsdeliberately refrain from adopting a policy because they have learnedfrom the failure of similar policies implemented abroad (Marsh andSharman 2009; Shipan and Volden 2012). This type of learning cannotbe captured by contemporary statistical techniques. In a similar vein,governments might implement alternative policies because they cannotor do not want to pursue the same policy strategy as competing coun-tries. One way of dealing with this problem is to study policy diffusionnot only by analyzing policies that have already been implemented, butalso by examining the policy formulation process, or what Gilardi et al.(2021) call the issue definition stage.Diffusion processes are also dependent on the characteristics of aparticular policy. Diffusion should vary with the complexity and observ-ability of specific reforms. Complexity is “the degree to which aninnovation is perceived as relatively difficult to understand and use”(Rogers 2004, p. 242). Technically complex policies are not easy totranslate into legislation. The policy effects are not clearly observable or10 Critical Summary and Concluding Remarks 265ambiguous, whereas the necessity of technical and scientific expertise tolink solutions to policy problems is typically high (Makse and Volden2011, p. 111; Nicholson-Crotty and Carley 2016).Furthermore, the fit between policies adopted abroad and nationalcircumstances might be a crucial factor when examining why some coun-tries adopt specific policies and not others. A policy is more likely tospread among those countries in which it is compatible with the existingnational institutional setting (Pacheco 2012). Compatibility is “thedegree to which an innovation is perceived as consistent with existingvalues, past experiences, and needs of potential adopters” (Rogers 2004,p. 224). If a policy of a foreign state can easily be combined with anothercountry’s existing policies, it is more likely to be adopted (Boushey 2010;Shipan and Volden 2012). To test whether the institutional fit or policycompatibility between countries influences the diffusion process, indi-cators that describe the institutional structure and the existing (social)policy portfolio of each country could be used to generate time-varyingsimilarity matrices, e.g., by using two-mode networks.Overall, the methodological approach applied in this volume has itsstrengths and provides interesting insights. However, it also has weak-nesses. Many aspects, such as the direct transfer of a particular policyfrom one country to another, can only be addressed with qualitative, in-depth studies. Recent scholarly work in the social sciences has shownpromising ways as to how this can be done (Kuhlmann et al. 2020;Starke 2013). Diffusion research must also consider the approaches andmethods of transnational historical research and global history (Kettunenand Petersen 2011; Rodgers 2014). In short, interdisciplinary collabora-tion and the consistent application of mixed methods designs are neededmore than ever in order to better understand both the contextuality andthe patterns of global social policy diffusion.LiteratureBoushey, Graeme. 2010.

    "abstract": "This open access book analyses the global diffusion of social policy as a process driven by multiplex ties between countries in global social networks. The contributions analyze links between countries via global trade, colonial history, similarity in culture, and spatial proximity. Networks are viewed as the structural backbone of the diffusion process, and diffusion is anlaysed via several subfields of social policy, in order to interrogate which network dimensions drive this process. The focus is on a global perspective of social policy diffusion via networks, and it is the first book to explicitly follow this macro-quantitative perspective on diffusion at a global scale whilst also comparing different networks. The collection tests the network structures in terms of their relevance to the diffusion process in different subfields of social policy such as old age and survivor pensions, labor and labor markets, health and long-term care, education and training, and family and gender policy. The book will therefore be invaluable to students and researchers of global social policy, sociology, political science, international relations, organization theory and economics",
