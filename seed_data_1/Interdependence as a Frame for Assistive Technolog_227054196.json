Branham University of California, Irvine Irvine, CA sbranham@uci.edu ABSTRACTIn this paper, we describe interdependence for assistive technologydesign, a frame developed to complement the traditional focus onindependence in the Assistive Technology field. Interdependenceemphasizes collaborative access and people with disabilities’ important and often understated contribution in these efforts. Welay the foundation of this frame with literature from the academicdiscipline of Disability Studies and popular media contributed bycontemporary disability justice activists. Then, drawing on cases from our own work, we show how the interdependence frame (1) synthesizes findings from a growing body of research in theAssistive Technology field and (2) helps us orient to additionaltechnology design opportunities. We position interdependence as one possible orientation to, not a prescription for, research anddesign practice––one that opens new design possibilities andaffirms our commitment to equal access for people with disabilities.CCS Concepts• Human-centered design and evaluation methods.

The difference between the needs that many disabled people have and the needs of people who are not labeled as disabled is that non-disabled people have had their dependencies normalized.” - Ki'tay Davidson In Assistive Technology (AT) research, “independence” isoften taken for granted as the goal of our contributions. Forexample, the gold standard of wayfinding applications forpeople who are blind has long been “independentnavigation” [10,18,29]. Even when the goal is not explicitlystated, researchers and practitioners tacitly agree that “allaccessible computing approaches share a common goal ofimproving independence, access, and quality of life forpeople with disabilities” [60]. But what does“independence” really mean, especially in the context ofAT? To our knowledge, there has yet to be an exploration ofthis kind in the AT community. The parallel development oftwo discursive trends within and outside the AT communitysuggest these are timely and consequential questions to raise.Figure 1. An independence frame (left) emphasizes an individual’s relationship with the environment. Assistive technology (AT) devices are meant to bridge a perceived gap between disabled bodies and environments designed for non-disabled people. An interdependence frame (right) emphasizes the relationships between people, ATs, and environments, drawing out the roles of those with disabilities during collective work they do to create access. One trend comes from outside the AT community. Disabledactivists and scholars from disciplines spanning DisabilityStudies and Rehabilitation Medicine have begun tointerrogate the meaning of independence, identify itspotential negative impacts, and offer complementaryframings [12,17,21,22,25,32,35–38,40,41,58]. For example,Science and Technology Studies scholar Aimi Hamraieargues that an independence frame “ignores the fundamentalinterdependence of all bodies for sustenance, community,and care” and perpetuates systemic marginalization ofpeople with disabilities ([16], emphasis added).A second trend comes from within the field of AT. Recent publications have begun to document the significance ofsocial factors of assistive technology use, in ways thatsuggest “independence” does not always describe userbehavior or goals. For example, recent studies report thatdevice use and adoption can be affected by negative socialstigmas around having a disability. Specifically, assistivedevices can portray users as vulnerable or incapable, leadingto awkward social interactions and minimal use even when___________________________________________________________________This is the author's manuscript of the article published in final edited form as:Bennett, C.

At the same time, AT researchers have documented people withdisabilities working together with others to improve accessat work [7,8], during team sports [11], in face-to-facecommunication [13], and when using educational materials[55]. Other work described the fulfillment and joy disabledpeople found in helping others [27,54]. In these studies,access is not only a solution to a disability-related barrier; itis a way of being together and helping one another.We are interested to explore why so many disability experts believe “independence”––a term used widely in our field (even by the authors of the current paper)––could be considered misrepresentative or even harmful. We believe these parallel academic explorations have synergistic qualities that form a foundation for future research and design. Specifically, we propose the adoption of the term “interdependence” to describe and synthesize recent social insights from AT researchers, using language championed by disability scholars and activists. Rather than eschewing independence, we believe interdependence can expand and explore the varieties of ways one can be “not dependent.” We begin our exploration by situating independence andinterdependence within historical and political contexts. We then propose four ways that interdependence can enrich ourresearch: (1) by allowing us to see how people and things are connected, (2) by helping us to see simultaneous forms ofassistance in action, (3) by revealing often-underrepresentedcontributions by people with disabilities, and (4) bydestabilizing traditional hierarchies that rank abilities. We present three cases from our own work in the AT field thatillustrate the application of an interdependence framing. We show that many recent studies within the AT field havealready been aligning with these tenets, though this paperrepresents the first attempt to bring them together under a single frame, and we conclude with ideas for how interdependence can be applied in accessibility research.2. DISABILITY, INDEPENDENCE, AND INTERDEPENDENCE Models of Disability Because the meaning of “disabled” can vary widely, we begin with a brief explanation of how we use the term. We draw aspects of our definition from the evolving social model of disability. This model was first articulated by disability rights activists, and later introduced to the field of Disability Studies by Mike Oliver [42] to better represent views of people with disabilities. Oliver contrasted the social model with the individual model, the prominent conception of disability at the time. This model asserts that disability is a dysfunction of the body that should be cured, and that it is an individual’s responsibility to adapt to an inaccessible world. In contrast, Oliver’s social model locates disability within society, and asserts that quality of life for disabled people can be increased by removing physical and social barriers, improving attitudes, and anticipating the presence of people with disabilities in design and planning. While the social model is a valuable tool for understandinghow disability is tied to society, we agree with scholarlycritiques which seek to re-emphasize the body as animportant participant in disabling interactions. In this paper, we adopt Alison Kafer’s political/relational model ofdisability, which she identifies as a “friendly departure”from the social model [21]. This model views disability asnot occurring within an individual or infrastructure, butinstead produced through interactions.One important feature of Kafer’s model is its recognitionthat the category “disabled” shifts based upon material andsocial context. For example, the disabling impacts of a blindperson attending a primarily visual public presentation canvary depending on the overall culture around disability, therelationships they have with other attendees, their level ofcomfort disclosing their disability, and efforts on the part ofothers involved to make the presentation accessible. In otherwords, disability is not located within the blind person or the presentation slides, but in the blind person’s relationships toother people, objects, and customs.Some AT research reflects a political/relational model of disability. One study [49] showed AT dysfunction led both users with disabilities and those around them to relate technological error to the disabled person, decreasing confidence in that person’s abilities. Here, we can see how disability is created through relations among people and assistive technologies to form assumptions about the user’s capabilities. Similar to our proposed interdependence framing, we find the political/relational model of disability generative for AT research. Disability and IndependenceFor people with disabilities, asserting independence has beenand remains an important step toward equal rights. Suitably,the activist efforts of people with disabilities during thelarger US civil rights movement of the 1970’s was called the“Independent Living Movement.” The Independent LivingMovement declared that all people have equal worth, allpeople can and should make choices about their lives, andpeople with disabilities have the right to participate in public to the degree that nondisabled people can [2]. In the contextof this movement, “independence” did not mean that adisabled person should do things autonomously—as thedictionary definition of the word implies [67]—but thatsupports and structures should be in place so people with disabilities can make their own choices about their futures[21,28,46,47].This definition of independence was a reaction to a long history of state- and culturally-sanctioned dependence. Historically, people with disabilities have often been isolated from society, either living at home under the care of family or living in institutions in the care of the state––where “care” often involved egregious human rights violations [20,23]. Prior to the Independent Living Movement, few government programs offered funding for in-home care services, or “attendant care,” and public places included architectural                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               barriers which made it difficult to access everything fromsupermarkets to workplaces. The movement transformedhow disability was interpreted and supported outside communities of disabled people [2,14] and led to significantlegal advances and protections for people with disabilities.AT researchers seek to support independence throughassistive technologies like screen readers and switches; now some mainstream smartphones and computers include built-in text-to-speech and can be easily connected to variousinput and output devices. Recent work recognizes people with disabilities as makers who regularly customize theirassistive technologies, seeking to increase inclusion ininaccessible makerspaces [3,34,44]. These examplesdemonstrate the positive impacts of an independence frameon advancements in AT.InterdependenceWhile acknowledging the importance of the IndependentLiving Movement, some Disability Studies scholars andactivists critique its focus on independence as the main goal of accessibility [25,50]. Disability justice activist MiaMingus argues that independence is a myth. All peopleconstantly rely on others, even if those others are invisible tous (e.g., the people who manufacture goods we consume)[35]. Some go further to argue that emphasizing self-sufficiency can do harm to all people, disproportionatelyimpacting people with disabilities [12]. Amid critiques,some scholars have adopted a view that interdependentrelationships are necessary to achieve access.While the term interdependence has not been used in ATliterature, the concept has long been discussed in DisabilityStudies and disability justice circles. For example, in thevery first issue of the Disability Studies Reader, published in1997, Feminist Disability Studies scholar Susan Wendellargued that a culture based in “interdependence” as opposedto “self-reliance” would improve quality of life for disabledpeople [57]. Even before the term was adopted, interdependence was being practiced by disability activists. “Independence” was central to the Independent Living Movement, yet modes of disability activism were deeply interdependence-focused. For example, the first Center for Independent Living (CIL) consisted of a collective of UC Berkeley volunteers led by students with disabilities. They taught each other strategies for advocating access and living on their own, removed structural barriers around campus, ran a wheelchair repair shop, and built a network of trusted attendant care providers that disabled students could hire [47]. British disabled activists adopted the Western CIL model, but prefaced the names of their “living centers” with “integrated” or “inclusive”, instead of “independent,” to acknowledge these social aspects of access [2]. In other words, to achieve the goal of independent living, activists relied significantly on interdependent relationships with one another. Modern activist groups, like The Disability JusticeCollective in the San Francisco Bay Area, use the term“interdependence” to represent ways they need one another.Led predominantly by LGBTQ people of color, theirexperiences with multiple oppression necessitate reliance oncommunity support and collectively-done access [25,35– 37,50]. Part of the collective’s work is to help disabledcommunity members find trustworthy access partners. Forexample, their disability justice primer suggests sharingroutes home to stay safe, dividing access-related tasksaccording to group members’ strengths, and being flexibleto dynamic access needs such as offering remote attendance[50]. This type of close relationship development in theprocess of providing interdependent access has been calledaccess intimacy by disabled activist Mia Mingus [37].Independence or Interdependence?Given the universally positive presentation ofinterdependence above, it may seem that we alwaysadvocate interdependence over independence. We do not fortwo reasons. First, independence and interdependence are not dichotomous or mutually exclusive. Rehabilitationmedicine scholars [58] recommended that vocationalrehabilitation programs for people with disabilities teachinterdependence alongside independence. They argue thatteaching independence empowers people with disabilities totake control over their access needs. But, instillinginterdependence establishes them as contributors to––notjust recipients of––community support and assistance.Second, interdependence is not necessarily better thanindependence, and the following examples elucidate thesecomplexities. Disability Studies scholar Christine Kelly [22]described the possibilities and pitfalls of interdependence inher “frien-tendant” relationship. She is sometimes paid toprovide care for a man, Killian, who is also a close friend.Their companionship has honed an attunement among them,elevating her job responsibilities from completinginstrumental tasks to an interdependent mingling ofproviding care and being together. Their partnership bringsout Killian as not a passive recipient of care, but equal andactive in cultivating friendship. Yet, gendered histories ofpower make Kelly feel vulnerable and out of place when shetakes Killian into men’s restrooms.Another example shows how reliance on AT can sometimeslead to unfortunate outcomes. Science and TechnologyStudies scholars Moser and Law [41] described how awheelchair user’s travel plans went awry when their trainarrived with a broken wheelchair lift. In this case, the user’sinterdependent relations with unreliable AT and social institutions that tolerate trains without functional wheelchairlifts prevented their self-determination of mobility.These samples show that we can make sense of both positiveand negative experiences through an interdependence lens. In other words, interdependence does not ensure access. Yet, as we will argue in depth below, the framing helps illuminate new possibilities for AT design. Focusing solely onindependence––on whether an individual achieves a taskautonomously––leaves out important factors that can help usto for example, anticipate the awkward aspects of social                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 interactions and the roles of policy, labor, and materials thatshape infrastructural-level decisions [17]. In the followingsection, we define interdependence again, this time in termsorientated to the AT community.3. DEFINING INTERDEPENDENCE FOR THE ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY FIELD We now present four tenets to summarize what aninterdependence frame can reveal in our AT research. We have listed them here and explicate each below. Aninterdependence frame (1) focuses on relations, (2) helps usmake sense of multiple forms of assistance happeningsimultaneously, (3) draws out the often-underwrittencontributions of people with disabilities, and (4) can helpdisassemble hierarchies that prefer ability.Interdependence Allows Us to See RelationsThe definition of the term interdependence implies arelationship between people and things and focuses ourattention on what goes on within their interactions. We donot intend for the word “relations” to indicate a long-termhistory of interactions––rather, “relations” refers to a comingtogether of people and things in a particular moment in time.In articulating the political/relational model, Alison Kaferdescribes disability not as a static entity but as “events,actions, and encounters” [21] produced through interactions. Similarly, interdependence centers relations between thosethings that make and define disability and access. With aninterdependence framing, we can characterize theaccessibility of a situation with respect to a broader range ofinfluential factors that lead to them.In AT research, studying relations can help nuance theindividual experiences often reported in our findings.Notably, researchers like Shinohara and Wobbrock[43,48,49] have studied how social interactions that involveapparent markers of disability, like assistive technologies,impact both people with and without disabilities.The important relations that can be identified through an interdependence framing do not just include relations between people and assistive technologies, but also those between people in situations where assistive technologies are not used. For example, AT researchers [59] conducted observations of blind and sighted partners navigating new environments together. This work identified ways in which much navigation research seeks to facilitate “sighted” styles of navigation for blind travelers, and why this may be challenging or dangerous because of sighted people’s misconceptions of blind navigation. Important for understanding navigation mishaps is examining the way sighted partners were trying to relate to their blind partner. When challenges arose, they mapped their experience onto their partners’ and subsequently provided instructions they would have appreciated should they have been the ones disoriented. Studying how everything and everyone involved in assistance is relating with one another can emerge opportunities for supporting smoother interactions. Interdependence can Reveal Simultaneous Relations and AssistanceIdentifying relevant relations will provide insight intointeractions, but interdependence also makes available thepossibility that there might be simultaneous relationsimpacting a particular moment. Disabled activists includingNomy Lamm [25] who write about collective accessdescribe it as an ongoing process where everyone supportsone another. This means that some people provide accesssupport while receiving it, and multiple types of accesssupport are provided during one event. An interdependenceframing can involve breaking down assistance acts to learnhow each participant is providing and receiving assistance.By attending to simultaneous relations, we can also view how else people are connecting during assistive interactions.Again, Kelly’s autoethnography of her [22] “frien-tendant”relationship with Killian is illustrative. “Frien-tendant”thoughtfully described their relationship as more than themechanical acts of assistance that could be performed by anyattendant interchangeably. She explicitly acknowledged theways in which Killian simultaneously supports her throughtheir relationship, acting with care to identify what she iscapable of providing and how it will impact their friendship.In AT research, work like Branham and Kane’s explorationof mixed-ability co-habitants [8] demonstrates assistance asmore complex than a solution to a problem. Assistance andrelationship maintenance were intertwined—while non-disabled partners were happy to help their partners withdisabilities, both parties sometimes found acts of assistinginterfered with other important factors in their relationship.Relationships between people can pre-date requests foraccess help, or become more complex through assistiveinteractions themselves. Studying simultaneous relations inthe context of AT research can reveal opportunities tosupport relations that intertwine with assistive interactions.Interdependence can Reveal the Work Done by People with Disabilities Since interdependence considers everyone and everything inan interaction to be mutually reliant, this framing canforeground some of the historically-ignored (but extremelyimportant) work done by people with disabilities.Traditionally, people with disabilities are portrayed asrecipients of, not agents in, securing their assistance [20]. But the Independent Living Movement thrived on activistswith disabilities helping one another, and their demandsinfluenced law and policy which impacted many people outside the movement itself. Interdependence can reveal thework that goes into access holistically, including theimportant, overlooked work done by people with disabilities.An interdependence framing would not take the presence ofaccommodations in a building––such as wheelchair ramps at the entrances or AT software installed on computers––as evidence of “access.” Instead, these tangible accommodations should be studied in concert withsociotechnical considerations. Access in this setting also                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 includes how people with disabilities operate with technologies, communicate their needs, and manage their AT-mediated interactions in hopes of presenting themselves professionally. An interdependence framing can help us more adequately represent everyone’s needs and contributions and encourages us to focus more attention on the practices that people with disabilities engage in to co-create accessibility with their peers. This work done by people with disabilities to secure accesshas previously been described in AT and feminist-orientedHCI research as “invisible” [7,52]. Branham and Kane [7]documented the ways blind employees do their jobs in mixedability workplaces. Sighted employees pervasivelymisunderstood access needs, and office spaces and culturesstill proved inaccessible. The blind participants’ accountsdemonstrated the lengths that blind employees undertook,largely unknown to sighted employees, to maintainawareness of inaccessible aspects of work. Blind employeesalso had to invest time and energy in educating colleagueson how best to assist them. Rather than attributing access andaccommodations to the presence of support resources in aspace, interdependence ensures that we are also givingsignificance to the work people with disabilities do tocommunicate and co-create accessibility.Interdependence can Challenge Ability-BasedHierarchiesFinally, since interdependence considers everyone mutuallyreliant, it asserts that people with and without disabilities are equal. Traditionally, society has viewed people withdisabilities as being worth less than their nondisabledcounterparts [15], so their actions and contributions are oftenranked lower in a hierarchy of importance. This orderingarises from the prominent and problematic narrative thatassistance provides mechanisms through which people withdisabilities become more able, more whole, more “normal”– –essentially, more like non-disabled people [38].Science and Technology Studies scholar, Ingunn Moser,interviewed people with disabilities about their ATs showinghow the technologies themselves, along with factors such asgovernment resources, high cost, and disability-relatedstigmas, undermine people with disabilities. Their efforts tonavigate complex insurance and government-fundedprograms to justify their technology needs, and the skill tooperate specialized interfaces went unrecognized in favor offocusing on the liberation such programs and devicesprovided [39,41]. Interdependence seeks to break out of thiscircular problem by explicitly valuing people, includingthose with disabilities, from the outset for who they are andirrespective of their abilities or assistive technologies theyuse. Instead, they are assumed integral to interdependentinteractions for bringing valued perspective and skillregardless of whether they are assisting, being assisted, ordoing both. With this in mind, an interdependence framingcan help us to contribute research that pushes back on thesehistories with not only accessible designs but also designswhich give attention to and challenge ability-basedhierarchies.Prior AT research has worked to challenge these implicithierarchies and biases across different domains. The designers of Incloodle [51] observed that neurotypicalchildren often excluded neurodiverse children from playactivities, and designed a cooperative photographyapplication to enforce equal participation among participantsto counter this hierarchy. Other work explored the potentialof people with disabilities as employees [65] or volunteers[24,27], recognizing their unique strengths rather thanimmediately classifying people with disabilities as “lessthan.” These papers begin the hard work of challenginghierarchies that devalue disabilities in favor of moreabilities.4. APPLYING THE INTERDEPENDENCE FRAME: THREE CASES Using these tenets, we present three cases drawn from ourresearch on the accessibility practices of people with variousdisabilities. We chose these cases to represent a diversity ofcontexts, disabilities, and scopes. Collectively, theyexemplify the flexible application of an interdependenceframe to interpret how accessibility is made by people, including those with disabilities, in everyday situations.Case 1: Organic Interdependence on Aisle 3The first case draws from field observations of two people shopping together. The couple, William and Emily, are bothvisually impaired. Emily has no sight and she navigates withher guide dog, Jasmine. William has a full field of very littlesight and he navigates with a white cane. This case was oneof several observations of finite interactions of assistance,hence data collected are in the form of a conversationtranscript. Below is an excerpt from the transcript ofWilliam, Emily, and Jasmine, exiting a store afterpurchasing items. We then share how an interdependenceframing sensitizes us to the four above tenets.Emily:\t Do you want me to find the door?William:\t Yeah go on then yeah.Emily:\t Where have we gone now? [Emily and Jasmine begin to walk right down an aisle]William: \tI think we've… Oh, we've headed up to the perfumes.Emily: \t ‘scuse me. [Walks around someone].Emily:\t [speaking to Jasmine] Good girl. [to William]Where are we going?William: \tAre we lost?Emily: \t Yeah,… errrr… [Turns left] (to Jasmine) Straight on. Find the door. Good girl, find the door. Find the door, good girl [Emily and Jasmine stop about 4 meters in front of door]. Oh, it doesn't open. William: \tIt’s not an automatic door. [Walks around Emily and Jasmine and opens swinging door]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Emily:  Oh, isn’t it? [Walks through as William holds door open]. Oh, hehahehaheha. We got stumped by a door. RelationsIt is clear from this vignette that William, Emily, andJasmine are in relation with one another and the store to findthe exit. Through conversation, they asked each other forhelp, share access information, and check on one another’sunderstanding of their progress. Additionally, they related tothings around them and their memories to find the door.Simultaneous Relations and AssistanceThis scenario shows how relating to one another and the environment made finding the door possible. Yet it is impossible to understand the process without considering that William, Emily, and Jasmine were simultaneously relating and providing access. Each was using the resources available to them to make sense of the environment for everyone. In this way, William, Emily, and Jasmine each scaffolded assistance. Specifically, Emily established that she would locate the door—but she was assisted by William who grounded their location after smelling and visually recognizing perfume counters, from Jasmine who recalled the direction of the door after Emily’s command to find it, and again from William who opened the door. Each took information from the other to generate new information, and trying to understand anyone’s relationship in isolation would omit important details of how they left the store. Additionally, to understand the assistance, we have to learnabout the other relationships. In this case, we see evidenceof access intimacy where Emily and William and Emily andJasmine work well together. William and Emily did not have to tell the other when they detected that their navigationstrengths might be useful, or when the other might know what to do next. Instead, they switched guiding one anotherseamlessly. Additionally, Emily has undergone extensivetraining and years working with her guide dog, and as partners, the two have developed attunement such that Emilycould give Jasmine commands mid conversation withWilliam. Considering the multiple relationships helps us tounderstand the assistance as situated and personal to them.Visible Work and Challenging HierarchiesOne unique aspect of this case when considered alongside research on guidance is that both William and Emily arevisually impaired. This foregrounds the important work eachdid to assist in finding the exit. Without full access to thenumerous visual cues that may have orientated them, theyinstead leveraged resources they could make sense of.Warren could smell perfumes and slightly make out displaycounters, and their navigation aids helped them to avoidobstacles. An interdependence framing also classifies thenondominant strategies they used as legitimate informationsources to draw from in providing assistance. Recognizingthis helps us to not compare their strategies to those thatsighted people might use, but to think about how technologymay support strategies that already work for them.This conversation provides a momentary snapshot from anentire day of shopping. But analyzing how William andEmily communicated through an interdependence lensrevealed rich insights from even a short transcript. Wewitnessed their multiple relationships with one another andtheir environment working in concert toward helping themto find the door, and how they leveraged orientation andnavigation strategies unsupported by the store’s cuesassuming customers would have full vision. Taking anyaspect of their interaction on its own would leave outimportant factors that contributed to William and Emily’saccomplishment. Instead, it was their relations with oneanother and their environment along with undertakingstrategies available that revealed informative nuances of aseemingly unremarkable act of exiting a store. In that moment, William and Emily did not want tools to emulatevision, and they did not consider assistance separate fromjust being together. Rather, our research could pinpointspecific ways to support their process.Case 2: Working Out Interdependent StrengthsThe second case comes from a professional workplace in thepublic sector. The scope of study was three members of ateam comprising roughly ten colleagues, who work closelywith one another in nearby cubicles. The researchersconducted interviews and observations to assess theaccessibility practices in the office.Disability and access were central to the identity of the team in two ways. First, the team’s mission was to oversee disbursement of grant funding to address workplace accommodations and accessibility initiatives for state and local governments. Second, every member of the team identified as having a disability. The three members who worked most closely with one another represented a wide spectrum of ability: one was blind (Abby) and accompanied by a guide dog (Ali), another was hard of hearing (Bruce) and used hearing aids, and another was a wheelchair user (Crissy). In the context of the organization, Abby was most senior. Bruce reported to Abby as her reader for half of his daily duties. Crissy had more seniority and responsibility than Bruce, but was a slightly more junior mentee of Abby. This team was one small part of a much larger organization in which people with disabilities were a minority. Below, we explore how these team members encounteredand collaboratively approached accessibility challenges inthe office. We draw out the tenets of interdependence fromobservations of work practices, and through participants’ own accounts of their relationships with one another.(Simultaneous) RelationsWork in the office was often collaboratively sharedaccording to the strengths of each team member andnegotiated to bring activities in alignment with interests ofthe collective. For example, Abby and Crissy often practicedwhat Crissy called “cross-ability cooperation.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Crissy: “I will come [to the vending machine] when she wants to, and I'll go ‘well, what do you feel like?’ andshe'll tell me what she feels like and I'm like, ‘on thisrow, they've got––’, you know and I'll describe the different products, and then I'll go ‘which one do youwant?’ and I'll push the button for whichever one it isand Abby will bend over to retrieve the snack.”Abby: “We developed a collaborative cafeteria plan. We’d go downstairs and scare the hell out of people because I’d push her wheelchair or get food for her and carry stuff back for her. ‘Crissy, do I [Abby] have schmutz on my pants?’ That takes a lot of time and friendship to get to that arrangement.” Crissy and Abby developed a relationship in which they arefamiliar with each other’s abilities and find ways to worktogether that play to their strengths. Crissy described visualinformation while Abby pushed Crissy’s wheelchair andgrasped out-of-reach items. But their interdependence didnot come immediately or outside other relationships. It tookAbby a long time to feel comfortable enough with Crissy toinquire about her appearance after eating. Though the pairembraced “scaring the hell out of people,” Abbyacknowledged that their interdependence with visibledisabilities is an uncommon sight, inviting attention frompassersby who question their suitability to work together.Abby and Crissy were not just assisting one another; theyoperated in more complex relations with other colleagueswho offered different complementary strengths:Abby: “I often give Bruce a spreadsheet and say, ‘this iswhat I want you to track in it.’ Crissy tries to do it herself [but she has trouble tracking]. It took me awhile to get there, if I was younger it would have felt like a cop out [to ask Bruce for help].”Abby delegated work that both she and Crissy couldtechnically do, but not as efficiently or accurately as Bruce. Abby was aware that when she was less comfortable withher own strengths and weaknesses, she would have felt it a“cop out” to delegate. But, she felt a security in both hercareer and her disability that allowed her to lean intointerdependent relationships to achieve access.Even when Abby worked with a nondisabled colleague inanother unit of the company, an interdependence framinghelps us see the contributions made by both parties:Abby: “I've worked with [sighted worker] for years. We'vebecome good friends, because I started here 6 yearsago, and I couldn't read the grant awards, the budgets.I called her up and asked her. Just recently, her whole team went to an accessibility training in order to try toimprove their PDF documents.”Interviewer: “So, it helps to have friends over there.”Abby: “It does. Well, it helps to become real. You know,there's an image of accessibility, there's an image of 'this is the right thing to do.' But, when you have aperson who needs access and that person is real toyou, then you're going to try hard.”Here, we found that Abby worked to develop relationships with colleagues who might be seen as gatekeepers to access. Through six years of ongoing engagement, Abby was able to demonstrate to remote colleagues that she was a “real” person who could be included in collaborations if only they would make small changes to workflows like creating accessible PDFs.  The outcome of her ongoing labor resulted in interdependency with nondisabled colleagues who began producing documents accessibly from the start. Visible WorkIn the examples above, making visible the work done bypeople with disabilities is integral for researchers and theparticipants. Visibility not only helps researchers understandco-creation of access more holistically, but it led Abby’scolleagues to humanize access from abstract guidelines to anessential component for blind employees to do their job. Thisincreased understanding then motivated the colleagues tointegrate accessible pdf production into their workflow.Finally, it is important to recognize the interdependencythese colleagues have with office culture that is friendly tocommunication, collaboration, professional development, and working relationships that do not rank disability lower.As elaborated below, this culture is what makes articulatingaccess work possible.Challenging HierarchiesThe three coworkers reported to supervisors in a traditionalmanagerial hierarchy. Abby was forthcoming that herseniority increased her comfort to ask for and accept helpfrom colleagues. An interdependence reading of theircollaboration, however, illuminates how their situation bothperpetuates and disrupts traditional professional and ability-based hierarchies. For example, despite her seniority, it tookAbby six years of advocacy to convince sighted colleaguesto produce accessible PDFs. Her persistent advocacy andongoing friendship with an employee on the team led hercolleagues to get training to produce accessible documents.Participants made clear that accessibility was achieved“together,” “with” each other, and without one partnercontrolling the other. Abby expressed this in many ways:“I couldn’t attach two, three, or more attachments because the buttons became hidden to JAWS [screen reader]… [Bruce] told me where I was without trying to take over.”“Instead of worrying about people saying, ‘he’s doing it for her.’ He’s not. He’s doing it with me.”We find here that Abby did not rank herself with Bruceaccording to their abilities; in fact, she considered such a metric irrelevant when they could do something together.These examples show how interdependence allows people with heterogeneous abilities to visibly pool their strengths toachieve shared access. Moreover, like the disability justiceactivists, interdependence was not an abstract frame forresearchers to apply to observations; participants livedcollaborative accessibility and described it in such terms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Case 3: Interdependent Activism at a DistanceThe 2017 Women’s March on Washington was a protest of Donald Trump’s election as president despite a history of anti-women behavior and politics. Planning for the protest spread wildly via social media, and Women’s Marches were held simultaneously in over four hundred cities in the United States on January 21st, 2017. The event promoted resistance among women who might be impacted by policies limiting reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and healthcare reform. However, a “march” demands that participants be able to execute a certain set of physical abilities (including standing and moving throughout the streets) and involves many sensory stimuli that might trigger symptoms. As a result, this “Women’s March” by nature was not inclusive of women with mobility impairments, weaker immune systems, and certain mental health conditions. Accessibility problems were compounded by the ability-specific rhetoric used to describe the march on social media. Organizers and attendees highlighted the importance of physical presence at the march and the need to “stand together in solidarity” [66]. In reflection, many Women’s March attendees again emphasized the importance of their attendance in person, commenting that “I just felt so empowered being there” or “I felt the need to show up with my body and my voice.” ([33], emphasis added). Frustrated by the inaccessibility of “marching” and hopingto ensure representation of women with disabilities in themovement, a group of mostly-female advocacy writers (whowere already connected online around their shared healthconditions) conceptualized and ran a “Disability March.”The Disability March was a blog and social media platformwhere disabled women and their allies could asynchronouslyshare stories of resistance against misogynist and ableist structures in society. Building on prior work [26], we presentthe Disability March as an example of collective action thatembodies the major concepts of interdependence.(Simultaneous) RelationsThe Disability March demonstrates a great deal of the relational work of interdependence amongst the march’s participants, observers, and organizers. Participants attended the Disability March to join in the communal expression of outrage that participation in the Women’s March signified, and to support the marchers attending the event in person. Often, they invited other people with disabilities from their own networks to join the Disability March, broadening the reach of their own stories and building the collective. By joining the Disability March, these individuals both contributed to and were shaped by the larger movement. The Disability March was created to reach a wide audienceof observers, consisting of both people with and withoutdisabilities. This mixed audience again fosters the mutualreliance that is core to interdependence. People withdisabilities contributed their stories, sharing their uniquelived experience with people without disabilities who mightnot have access to their expertise otherwise.Additionally, people we spoke with highlighted the ways inwhich they simultaneously participated in non-digitalactivism. Some described how they leveraged existingaccess intimacies to attend in-person events with theirfamilies or friends. While their companions often had to take the role of “caregiver” in these travels, their attendance wasmutually reliant, building a larger coalition together. Othersfound opportunities to generate new access intimacies withstrangers around their shared cause. For example, oneparticipant described a new form of collective activism: “Last night I found a group called ‘Walk with Us’ where they match a disabled person to go [to a rally or protest];instead someone else can go in your place. They take apicture of you and you sit and get connected with them….”This project fostered connections between members of themovement, strengthening its coherency and broadening itspresence. Many organizers began as participants, but were drawn into more formal roles in which they could support the organization through the skills they brought with them.Visible WorkAll of the work of the Disability March was conceived,organized, and executed by people with disabilities, and thetwo core organizers we spoke with identified as female andqueer, respectively. These organizers operated as agents ofaccessibility, rather than recipients of it, developing asatellite movement to fit their own needs and abilities.However, this process required a large amount of invisiblework and coordination among organizers, which may nothave been recognized by most Women’s March participants.The Disability March was initiated by members of anexisting collective of writers with chronic illness. Thisstructure allowed them to leverage their existing expertiseand practices for ensuring accessibility (e.g., including textdescriptions of all images posted on their website) to thedesign of the platform. Rather than striving for a marchexperience that directly replicated the physical march, theseorganizers identified the critical roles of asynchrony andmultimedia in communicating around accessibility andembedded these values into their platform. This march waslikely more successful because of the insights contributed bydisabled organizers and helped the original Women’s Marchbetter recognize the limitations of in-person marching.Challenging HierarchiesThe development of the Disability March directly contradicts some of our traditional, hierarchical understandings of “assistance” and “care.” First, the Disability March itself draws on the early disability rights protests – a group of activists self-organizing to ensure that their access needs were met appropriately. Examining an event with an interdependence lens gives us the awareness that people with disabilities can be organizers and initiators of movements, rather than passive participants or beneficiaries of others’ activism. The public nature of the Disability March similarly served toflatten traditional ability-based hierarchies. The Disability                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    March was a tangible reminder from disabled women thattheir voices and their representation mattered just as muchas the able-bodied women who could attend events inperson. The organizers and participants recognized theimportance of spreading a disabled perspective at a broaderlevel, and one participant drew attention to the number ofpeople with disabilities to indicate how prevalent thoseperspectives have become:“That’s why I was so interested to participate - becausepeople with disabilities have so much to say, and now it isnational. The Disability March has introduced [ourparticipation] to a new level… the repercussions of theoutcome of election has so much put us in the front now….”5. DISCUSSION This paper is the first attempt we know of in the AssistiveTechnology community to articulate the origins andmeanings of the term independence as it pertains to peoplewith disabilities. Our inquiry demonstrates the importantrole independence has played in orienting toward disability,specifically for advancing disabled peoples’ claim to basichuman rights. Our inquiry also surfaced contemporaryscholarship and activism that offers a complementary frame, interdependence. Interdependence emphasizes how myriadpeople and devices come together to build access, withspecial attention to acknowledging the work of people withdisabilities. We propose that an interdependence frame cansynthesize recent scholarly contributions from within the ATfield, which increasingly emphasize social dimensions ofaccessibility (e.g., [48,49,54,59,64]).Applying our interdependence lens, we learn how accessoccurs through interactions that are not just about gettingsomething done. Rather, access is entangled with being anddoing together when shopping, working, or even protesting.Below, we share how the interdependence frame raises new opportunities for three vibrant areas of AT research.5.1 Crowd Work and Interdependence We identify two threads of ongoing research related tocrowd work and accessibility that may be usefully expandedthrough an interdependence framing. First, AT researchers[4,5,9,24,27,53,56,61,62,65] have explored crowd work as ameans for people with disabilities to both receive assistanceand find employment. Research regarding on-demandassistance focuses on systems, like VizWiz andRegionSpeak [4,6,62], that connect a disabled person in needof assistance with a remote crowd worker. Costs associatedwith this model, along with exciting innovations in AI, havenudged future directions for this work toward minimizinghuman assistance [31,63]. As such, crowd work solutionscan be seen as an early means of amassing ground truth datato train machine learning models for fully-automated tools.A second thread of research addresses the viability of crowdwork as a source of income and volunteerism for older adults[9,24] and people with disabilities [27,53,56,65]. Findingsshow that members of this population are interested andcapable of doing the work. Benefits of crowd work,including flexible hours and working from home, meet theneeds of some workers with disabilities. However, pervasiveinaccessibility of crowd work platforms significantlyimpedes full participation of people with disabilities.An interdependence framing allows us to ask questionsabout these threads and offer new directions for assistivecrowd work research in three ways.First, whereas crowd work systems tend to consider tasksmutually exclusive, an interdependence frame mightrecommend crowd work systems that allow requesters andworkers to build rapport and complete multiple taskstogether. When requesters and task completers do not know one another, crowd work platforms might provide questionsto help the requester more adequately contextualize theiraccess need. And, because interdependence sees people withdisabilities as agents in creating access, the system mightrecruit people with disabilities to assist other requesters withor without disabilities. Such considerations would positionpeople with disabilities as eligible to provide and receive assistance, explicitly denoting their contributions whilechallenging ability-based hierarchies.Second, current crowd work systems that provide remote visual assistance classify blind task submitters differently from (sighted) workers completing tasks. Interdependence highlights work done by people with disabilities, raising questions about who is credited for what. At first glance, the person assigned a task seems to be doing work; their title as a crowd “worker” makes this explicit. System names like “BeMyEyes”  [68] minimize the role of blind individuals by framing them as passive recipients of assistance. Yet, this overlooks the significant work performed by the blind requesters to send a photo or video, work that requires them to negotiate highly visual access barriers [19]. These systems could, for example, allow blind requesters to supplement photograph submissions with contextual information that may help someone answer in absence of a perfectly framed or clear image. At the same time, though task completers are called “workers,” after the completed task is returned to the requester, their contribution disappears. Interdependence could guide conversations on limitations of systems that enforce each task to ultimately have one owner and speculate new forms of assistance that honor everyone’s contributions. Finally, advancements in object recognition present OCRsystems as replacements for human assistance. Yet,independence and interdependence can coexist as dual goalsfor accessibility. We can imagine hybrid solutions in whichfuture systems that automate tasks still integrate humanassistance. For example, Aira [31], a visual interpretingsubscription-based service, released smart glasses with OCRcapabilities. In this way, a subscriber can leverage automatedand human assistance through the same device.5.2 Ability-Based Design and Interdependence  An influential approach for designing assistive technologieshas been Wobbrock et al.’s Ability-Based Design [60].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Ability-Based Design contends that technologies should be responsive to each user’s unique interaction capabilities, and that AT researchers should design systems that areappropriate for multiple users and contexts. Because Ability-Based Design focuses on users’ independent interactionswith systems, other people and devices who enact assistanceare grouped in the broad category of “context.” With aninterdependence lens, we can expand Ability-Based design’scall for adaptive user interfaces to include considerations ofthe relationships people have with contexts––theirdisabilities, their devices, and other people. Our cases show that relationships between these threeelements of context were significant to interactions andaccessibility outcomes. William and Emily’s access needschanged as they traversed the store (Case 1), but theirexperiences relating with one another kept the navigationfrom presenting significant barriers. One way employeeswith different disabilities “hacked” accessibility was to swaptasks according to their strengths (Case 2), And participationin the Disability March changed the way some participantswith disabilities viewed their own identity (Case 3). Whilesome view online activities as slactivism, relating with acommunity of disabled remote marchers legitimized theircontributions, raising their confidence that disability couldrepresent an important perspective in political organizing.In response, AT’s could adapt according to these relations,such as when in the presence of a “frien-tendant” or in a social situation where the user does not want their disabilityto be apparent. Fiannaca et al.’s [13] AAC device does justthat by allowing users to specify what granularity of draftedtext conversation their partners can view based on theircomfort level with them. Ability-Based designs mightprovide a feature for users to share how they are interactingwith the system and when they encounter barriers; data couldbe used to shift misconceptions about the work people withdisabilities are (not) doing [49]. In this way, the values ofindependence that are bolstered by Ability-Based designscan be considered alongside interdependency.5.3 Navigation and Interdependence  Accessible navigation has long been a focus of AT research[10,18,29]. Navigation aids, whether or not developed withpeople with disabilities in mind, tend to focus on directing auser to a destination. While some allow users to select stopsalong the way, the task of navigating is largely presented asone in which a user follows instructions from a technology,with destination arrival as the metric for success.An interdependence framing guides us toward questionsfocusing on the journey—specifically about what relationswork together to facilitate navigation by people withdisabilities. Abdolrahmani et al. [1] studied how context anderror type intersect with disability to impact assistivenavigation device adoption. We see relationships at work toconstruct different scenarios with contingent needs andpreferences. For example, they found that a device guiding ablind user into the wrong store was not consequential tothem, but entering the preferred bathroom for their genderidentity was of paramount importance. Unlike predominantthemes in AT research which attempt to minimize errorsaltogether, they contend that navigation systems will not beerror free, so they instead direct research to support context-appropriate error and safety management processes for userswith disabilities. We expand this research direction tosuggest that navigation systems could combine multiple types of assistance throughout the journey to support navigation management. This could include navigationsystems that allow a user to triangulate information frommultiple sources. Additionally, users with disabilities couldenroll access partners [45,61] to suggest alternative routes orto explain segments undiscernible by technology.Interdependence could also inform navigation by people with mixed abilities [7,8,59]. Past research [59] found cross-ability navigation assistance was not always joyfully done;sighted people misunderstood how to best assist blindwalking partners. In the context of the home, someparticipants were cognizant that asking for assistancestrained sighted partners leaving those with visualimpairments unsure how to contribute to the relationship [8]. An interdependence framing could support collaborative assistance and well-being by pointing out opportunities forpeer support. Systems might assign different access partnerswith complementary abilities and allocate time to check inon each other’s concerns and energy levels.We have demonstrated how an interdependence frame canwiden existing areas of AT research. While interdependencecan be critical of the limitations of previous independence-focused research, it is also generative, encapsulating amethod for transferring the relational assistance we haveobserved into actionable directions for AT research.6. CONCLUSION We introduced interdependence as a complementary framefor AT researchers. Interdependence (1) considers access tobe relational and (2) simultaneous, (3) highlights thecontributions of people with disabilities, and (4) challengestraditional hierarchies of ability. We demonstrated theframe’s benefits by applying it to three cases from ourresearch and three emergent areas of AT research: crowdwork, Ability-Based Design, and navigation. We presentinterdependence as a frame not to guide designing for people with disabilities from a distance, but by them, as itsintroduction into the ASSETS community is indebted totheir lived experience, activism, and scholarship.7.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe interdependence for assistive technology design, a frame developed to complement the traditional focus on independence in the Assistive Technology field. Interdependence emphasizes collaborative access and people with disabilities' important and often understated contribution in these efforts. We lay the foundation of this frame with literature from the academic discipline of Disability Studies and popular media contributed by contemporary disability justice activists. Then, drawing on cases from our own work, we show how the interdependence frame (1) synthesizes findings from a growing body of research in the Assistive Technology field and (2) helps us orient to additional technology design opportunities. We position interdependence as one possible orientation to, not a prescription for, research and design practice--one that opens new design possibilities and affirms our commitment to equal access for people with disabilities",
