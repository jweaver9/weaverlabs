Likewise, there is consideration of the impact of societal attitudes towards multicultural education and acts of inclusivity on the implementation of such ideas. Societal attitudes mentioned include state legislature and literature censorship. The implementation of multicultural education would inherently represent larger numbers of underrepresented communities and individuals, which would then be included in the classroom. This Capstone looks to understand the potential impact of thorough implementation of multicultural education and inclusive, representative literature for youth.

Rather, multicultural education is a philosophical concept and approach to education that gives priority to how cultural identities influence the individual (National Association for Multicultural Education, 2023; American Psychological Association, 2023). The aim of multicultural education is to not only incorporate cultural identities into educational programming, but for students to define their own identities and promote inclusivity inside and outside of the classroom (American Psychological Association, 2023). The National Association for Multicultural Education (2023) further describes the process of multicultural education as follows: Multicultural education advocates the belief that students and their life histories and experiences should be placed at the center of the teaching and learning process and that pedagogy should occur in a context that is familiar to students and that addresses multiple ways of thinking. In addition, teachers and students must critically analyze oppression and power relations in their communities, society and the world. […] Recognizing that equality and equity are not the same thing, multicultural education attempts to offer all students an equitable educational opportunity, while at the same time, encouraging students to critique society in the interest of social justice. Similarly, the definition of inclusion often varies depending on one’s own interpretation and conceptualization (Krischler et al., 2019). It is heavily reliant on context, being that it can encapsulate many different groups of people in many different circumstances.  LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 6Applications of Multicultural Education  Being that multicultural education is subject to context and an individual’s understanding of the concept (Krischler et al., 2019; Özturgut, 2011), there are also many variations of application. Despite their differences in details, many culturally centered approaches to education are derived from multicultural education concepts. Culturally Responsive Education Culturally responsive education is a practice of standards, instruction, and assessment that adapts to students’ cultural beliefs and practices (Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, 2021). Those who subscribe to culturally responsive education understand students’ learning and capabilities as a contextual to a student’s culture and local community (Zengilowski et al., 2022). This prioritizes the student’s multicultural background in their learning, allowing for self-expression and connecting new information to their prior cultural, social, and conceptual knowledge (Zengilowski et al., 2022). Educators are encouraged to examine instructional material and make decisions as to whether the material is appropriate and considerate of the cultures within their classroom (Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, 2021; Zengilowski et al., 2022). The time-constrained schedule of educators can limit how much research is put into their instructional material, however (Sleeter, 2012). Culturally responsive often receives backlash, as using a new approach to a dated system of education is inherently political, as it challenges the preservation of the United States’ non-inclusive, White culture (Sleeter, 2012). Anti-Racist Education According to Kishimoto (2018), anti-racist education is a method of how one teaches, reflects upon cultural awareness, and instills social change within their class, curriculum, and educational system. It is a response to education with roots drawn from Critical Race Theory LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 7principles (Kishimoto, 2018). Further, this school of thought encourages educators to illuminate the institutional barriers that non-white people face, find patterns of oppression, and question if their own institutions are upholding their claims for diversity and multiculturalism (Alderman et al., 2021). Students’ experiences as an individual and member of their cultural communities are highly valued in the employment of anti-racist education as well. Youth are viewed as a ‘co-constructor of knowledge’ in anti-racist education principles (Sánchez et al., 2021). Their experiences and cultural understandings are drawn from to create unique, active roles in learning and create new perspectives (Sánches et al., 2021). Anti-racist education should be learned in any educator preparation program; however, it is equally important that anti-racist education continue throughout an educator’s practice (Sánchez et al., 2021). Ongoing reflection and dedication to the practice of anti-racist education is what will keep it thriving, as this kind of practice is not just a method but an intentional and organizational approach (Kishimoto, 2018).  Current Events and Standards  Societal attitudes and beliefs greatly influence how people perceive themselves and others. In fact, such attitudes can demonstrate to children how to interact with one another (Qondias et al., 2022). Evaluating the current state of our attitudes towards others can illustrate implicit biases in society, which then reveals what children are learning about other cultures (DePaoli et al., 2021). Furthermore, societal attitudes are reflected in political and legal policies set forth which create major boundaries on what children are exposed to. Societal Attitudes Toward Race According to the Pew Research Center (2019), 65% of Americans, across varying racial identities, agree that “it has become more common for people to express racist or racially insensitive views since Trump was elected president,” with 45% stating that it has becoming LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 8more acceptable to do so. This same survey revealed that 76% of Black and Asian people, as well as 58% of Hispanic people, say “they have experienced discrimination or have been treated unfairly because of their race or ethnicity at least from time to time.” 67% of white people reported having never experienced discrimination based on their race (Pew Research Center, 2019). Societal Attitudes Toward LGBTQ+ As of May 2022, only 71% of Americans believe that same-sex marriage should be considered valid and allowed the same rights as heterosexual couples (Gallup, 2023). Another poll conducted in 2019 asked participants about their impression of how Americans feel about gay and lesbian relations, to which 55% answered that they feel the general population is accepting (Gallup, 2023). This same poll asked if new civil rights laws should be introduced to protect LGBTQ+ people; only 53% of respondents believed that new legislation is necessary (Gallup, 2023). According to the Pew Research Center (2022), 64% of Americans “would favor laws that would protect transgender people from discrimination in jobs, housing, and public spaces.” However, 41% of Americans would favor making it illegal for public elementary schools to include gender identity in their curriculum (Pew Research Center, 2022). Many individuals see allocating rights and protections to minority groups as a challenge to the current culture, fearing that these privileges will lead to the cessation of their own (Sleeter, 2012).  Following bipartisan discourse about the LGBTQ+ community, many lawmakers began discussing putting forth legislation restricting drag shows (NPR, 2023). In fact, Tennessee legislators introduced a bill that would do just this: An Act to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 7-51-1401 (Obscenity and Pornography), which would aim to classify drag shows as an “adult cabaret performance,” (Obscenity and Pornography Act, 2023). The following passage is LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 9the description of “adult cabaret performance,” according to the Obscenity and Pornography Act (2023):  \"Adult cabaret performance\" means a performance in a location other than an adult cabaret that features topless dancers, go-go dancers, exotic dancers, strippers, male or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest, or similar entertainers, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration; SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 7-51-1407, is amended by adding the following language as a new subsection: (c) (1) It is an offense for a person to engage in an adult cabaret performance: (A) On public property; or (B) In a location where the adult cabaret performance could be viewed by a person who is not an adult. Prior to this piece of legislation being introduced to Tennessee, House Bill 1557: “Parental Rights in Education” was passed in Florida. HB 1557 is colloquially known as the “Don’t Say Gay” Bill due to its restrictive nature, particularly in reference to the LGBTQ+ community and related discussion. Parental Rights in Education (2022) is defined as follows: Parental Rights in Education; Requires district school boards to adopt procedures that comport with certain provisions of law for notifying student's parent of specified information; requires such procedures to reinforce fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding upbringing & control of their children; prohibits school district from adopting procedures or student support forms that prohibit school district personnel from notifying parent about specified information or that encourage student to withhold from parent such information; prohibits school district personnel from discouraging or prohibiting parental notification & involvement in critical decisions affecting student's mental, emotional, or physical well-being; prohibits classroom discussion about sexual LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 10orientation or gender identity in certain grade levels; requires school districts to notify parents of healthcare services; authorizes parent to bring action against school district to obtain declaratory judgment; provides for additional award of injunctive relief, damages, & reasonable attorney fees & court costs to certain parents. Florida’s House Bill 1557 has been highly criticized for its implications for LGBTQ+ students, particularly in regard to their mental health and safety (Johnson, 2022). A 2020 survey conducted by The Trevor Project indicated that reports of suicide attempts were reduced by 35% amongst LGBTQ+ youth that had at least one affirming space (The Trevor Project, 2020). Across several surveys, there was a strong association between affirming school environments and reduced-odd suicide attempts being reported (The Trevor Project, 2020). House Bill 1557, however, could eliminate schools from being an affirming space for LGBTQ+ youth and exacerbate existing issues (Johnson, 2022). Though Tennessee and Florida are only two examples of state legislation, it is important to consider the implications of these new ideas becoming standard policy. Allowing these concepts to become precedent has prompted more conversations across states about limiting educational rights to teach comprehensive multicultural education. Not only could these bills impose detrimental consequences for LGBTQ+ youth, but they could drastically impact the educational system and limit the already minimal multicultural and inclusive materials and conversations in American classrooms. Censorship in Curriculum and Media With increasing tension regarding what is and should be discussed in schools, some changes are already being made. In addition to limiting classroom conversations referencing LGBTQ+ identities, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis passed another bill named “Individual LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 11Freedom.” A bipartisan nickname given to this bill is “Stop WOKE Act,” as the legislation aims to limit conversations relating to privileges connected to multicultural identities. The following comes from House Bill 7, Individual Freedom (2022):  Individual Freedom; Provides that subjecting individuals to specified concepts under certain circumstances constitutes discrimination based on race, color, sex, or national origin; revising requirements for required instruction on the history of African Americans; requiring the department to prepare and offer certain standards and curriculum; authorizing the department to seek input from a specified organization for certain purposes; prohibits instructional materials reviewers from recommending instructional materials that contain any matter that contradicts certain principles; requires DOE to review school district professional development systems for compliance with certain provisions of law. In accordance with House Bill 7, the Governor of Florida also abruptly banned instruction of Advanced Placement (AP) African American Studies in Florida high schools (Senator Powell, 2023). The primary reason for restricting AP African American Studies regarded the educational content of the course. Supporters of the sanction feared that the content could contain references to the Black Lives Matter movement and giving reparations (NPR, 2023). Such content would be in direct opposition to the new House Bill 7 (Senator Powell, 2023). Another method of censorship in schools has existed for decades, and the conversation surrounding it is growing. Book bans are a highly controversial, yet steadily increasing, means of restricting what is allowed in a classroom or school library. According to PEN America (2022), most books proposed for being banned are done so through a “growing number of advocacy LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 12organizations that have made demanding censorship of certain books and ideas in schools part of their mission,” as opposed to administration in education, parents, or school boards.  Between 2021 and 2022, 1,648 book titles were banned across the United States (PEN America, 2022). Adukia et al. (2022) suggest that there is a significant relationship between local beliefs and children’s books that promote positive sentiments towards characters of color; these books are much more likely to be purchased in areas with larger populations engaging in anti-racist mindsets. School Book Bans in America To investigate the idea of regional discrimination of literature, PEN America (2022) collected data on book bans across the United States and created a depiction of how many books each state has banned (see Figure 1). In total, there were 1,648 banned book titles. Of these book titles, many contained material particularly relevant to multicultural identities and multicultural education (see Figure 2). 674 of these books had LGBTQ+ themes or protagonists; 145 of which were specific to transgender characters. 659 books included protagonists and secondary characters of color. 338 books had a focus on race or racism, 161 included activism and rights, and 64 books illustrated religious minorities (PEN America, 2022). Banning books rids youth of the opportunity to learn about themselves, others, history, and a plethora of important information (PEN America, 2022). Educator Population  As of the 2020-21 academic year, 80% of public-school K-12 teachers across the nation identified as non-Hispanic White (Taie & Lewis, 2022). Additionally, 77% of public-school teachers are female (Taie & Lewis, 2022).   LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 13Review of Literature Impact of Resistance to Inclusion on Youth Children acquire their views of the world, each other, and other cultures through what is represented to them (Harper & Brand, 2010). The current state of the United States’ political climate and societal attitudes indicates a clear resistance to inclusion. However, it is crucial to understand why this resistance exists in order to effectively combat societal opposition to inclusion and promote a child’s understanding of the world around them (Applebaum, 2021).  White Fragility White fragility is defined as an unnatural, but socially learned, pushback response of a white person in open conversation about race and related issues (DiAngelo, 2018). This often looks like silence, contempt, or defensiveness; these overt reactions and other demonstrations of white fragility reiterate a system that upholds a ‘racial hierarchy’ (DiAngelo, 2018). Discussions about white fragility often elicit discomfort, particularly for white people. White people often experience ‘strong emotions’ in this type of racial dialogue, as it is frequently interpreted as a personal attack as opposed to a systemic disparity to which they are beneficiaries (Wilson & Massey, 2020; DiAngelo, 2018). In many instances, a white individual experiencing white fragility while examining the implications of systemic barriers for people of color, and possibly their own contributions, will exit such conversation (Wilson & Massey, 2020).  Ambiguity  The idea that many individuals are vulnerable to the ambiguousness of others’ remarks and provide benefit-of-the-doubt to mildly or overtly crude statements is one that allows white supremacy and racism to flourish (Applebaum, 2021). This is best observed in microaggressions and other displays of unconscious bias, where the intention of an action or statement may not be LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 14malicious but is rooted in discrimination. The ambiguity of some of these inherently biased comments can create an uncomfortable, or potentially unrecognizable, space for an educator to intervene or inform. It insists on ambiguity of the educator (Applebaum, 2021). This can produce or promote an unfair climate for diverse groups of students – putting responsibility in their hands to correct, educate, retaliate, or sit in complicity. Impact on Diverse Populations of Students The ideas of white fragility and ambiguity can be extended to understand society’s perceptions and reactions to discussion about gender and sexuality. For what is unfamiliar or uncomfortable to the majority, perhaps cisgendered heteronormative groups, creates a standard for what is allowed. Even if educators feel that they do not hold beliefs against certain groups, they may still hold implicit biases (DePaoli et al., 2021). Implicit biases can ultimately then affect students and their identities, as they may feel less capable due to social-identity threat (DePaoli et al., 2021).  Benefits of Multicultural Education and Inclusion  In order to understand the effects multicultural education and inclusive literature have on youth self-perception, benefits to multicultural education should be evaluated. Exposure to multicultural education proves to be relevant to not just children of color but white children as well (Hurley, 2005; Harper & Brand, 2010). Further, developments in educators’ cultural effectiveness and achieving educational equity is demonstrated in research surrounding the advantages of multicultural education (Hurley, 2005; DePaoli et al., 2021). Positive Self-Image in Multicultural Students LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 15By viewing multicultural, inclusive literature, any child is given the opportunity to see a reflection of themselves. Though questionable to what extent, it has been shown that children’s literature and media influences their self-image (Hurley, 2005). They can see a character that resembles them – their characteristics, insecurities, feelings, families, or even casual interactions – and feel affirmed (Harper & Brand, 2010).   Social and emotional learning (SEL) supports have been shown to improve student behavior and self-perception (DePaoli et al., 2021). Including SEL curriculum rooted in multicultural education and social justice principles can allow for examination of societal influences and build the self-perception of students of color as there is a higher priority in adapting to individualized values versus conformity (DePaoli et al., 2021). Multicultural literature can help guide all children’s understanding of what is unfair and in what ways they can advocate for themselves (Harper & Brand, 2010). This can further be fostered through personalized instruction, as teachers can pull from SEL assessments and student strengths (DePaoli et al., 2021). Peer Relations Multicultural literature encourages children to consider the perspective of others while simultaneously introducing them to understanding and respecting others’ cultural identities (Harper & Brand, 2010). Social attitude is very important for students since it becomes their basis to interact with teachers and peers in an acceptable manner (Qondias et al., 2022). Activating a child’s prior knowledge of other cultures and people can foster their comprehension of multicultural literature and aide them in building diverse relationships (Harper & Brand, 2010). Children’s empathy and social skills can be strongly influenced by multicultural literature LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 16that embraces acknowledging and appreciating differences in beliefs, values, and cultures, particularly when done in early childhood (Harper & Brand, 2010).  Culturally Responsive Educators Encouraging educators to include multicultural and inclusive works in their classrooms can promote cultural responsiveness; however, it thoroughly supports educators to be mindful and critical of what is being introduced to their students and the impact it has on them socially (Hurley, 2005). Including these works in the classroom is generally a good practice so that students can be exposed to new ideas or accurate reactions of themselves, but doing so also enables questions, conversations, and affirmations. Having culturally responsive educators become familiar with multicultural and inclusive literature and media can foster positive conversations as they challenge inherently biased systemic views and promote self-love in their students (Hurley, 2005). Equitable Education By having educators utilize a culturally sensitive and responsive approach with anti-racist foundations, school systems can begin to bridge a positive, inclusive, and equitable environment for students to thrive. In doing so, educators view the abilities and experiences of students of color as valuable through an asset-based lens, and they use these facets of their students’ identities to enhance their learning (DePaoli et al., 2021). This can be developed further by establishing meaningful connections with students, their families, and their cultures, then building upon these factors and including relevant connections within the classroom (DePaoli et al., 2021). Having a school system grounded in multicultural education and its subsidiaries will inherently provide pathways to equitable education, as the school system would require its educators to evaluate inequitable or disproportional variables like disciplinary referrals, school LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 17and district policies, educator demographics, teaching practices, resources and resource allocations, and conscious and unconscious biases (DePaoli et al., 2021).  Issues in Implementing Multicultural Education A common topic that arises when discussing education, particularly within the public-school system, is a lack of resources, support, and funding. Many teachers have reported that these issues alone are a major barrier in implementing multicultural literature and materials within their curriculum (Stallworth et al., 2006). Funding According to the Jacksonville Public Education Fund (2021), the Great Recession of 2008 caused United States public schools “nearly $600 billion in state and local revenue in the years following.” Had funding for public schools been preserved at pre-recession rates, present-day public-school funding would exist over $1 trillion in local and state revenue (Jacksonville Public Education Fund, 2021). This is also largely correlated to inflation, as the cost of education increases as inflation grows (Patton, 2021). In addition, the United States has inequitable policies for public-school funding. Fifteen states have policies in place that “allocate less funding to high-poverty districts than those with lower poverty rates,” (Jacksonville Public Education Fund, 2021).  Across the United States, many of these high-poverty school districts experience a conundrum when it comes to funding – primarily those that are upheld to performance-based funding. These school districts, whose students are poor and are primarily minority-identified, lack adequate funding from their state to afford their students the opportunity to achieve state-set targets, which thereby reinforces their lack of funding from the state (Rebell, 2018). Unequitable LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 18funding across schools, districts, and states creates unequitable learning opportunities for students, which thereby furthers unequitable achievement (Patton, 2021). The Jacksonville Public Education Fund (2021) proposes that governments and other educational agencies develop a “more progressive funding formula” to achieve equitable outcomes for all students. Educators’ Multicultural Awareness It is widely assumed that, due to frequent exposure to various multicultural backgrounds in the school system, educators are less likely to exhibit implicit bias or racial discrimination compared to the general population (Frankenberg, 2012). However, a study by Starck et al. (2020) revealed that the bias of educators is comparative to the general population despite societal perceptions and expectations of the school system. This demonstrates a lapse in society’s understanding of what occurs within the classroom, and it serves as a reminder – educators are susceptible to bias, too (Starck et al., 2020). Moreover, DePaoli et al. (2021) discovered Black students are often underestimated by their non-Black teachers, as they are held to lower expectations, instilled with negative labels, and overall interacted with less positively than their White peers. Systemic support for educators and students alike is needed to promote equitable classroom conditions for students (Starck et al., 2020).   In order to create a multiculturally-inclusive classroom, educators must not only obtain a sense of awareness, but curate skills such as cultural humility, emotional vulnerability, and reflection (Evans et al., 2020). Educators must apply these skills by evaluating the impacts of academic institutions, educational planning, and academic content on their marginalized students, and how educators reinforce and continue to perpetuate inequitable conditions (Evans et al., 2020). Additionally, educators must apply the same literary skills, instruction, conceptualization, and traditions to multicultural literature as classic literature; the relevance of LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 19the literature is lost otherwise, and it will not hold the same value as traditional curriculum (Stallworth et al., 2006). Unfortunately for many current educators, these strategies and literature should be introduced in their preservice education so that they can effectively integrate it into their own instruction (Sableski & Arnold, 2021). Curriculum. Without a particular model of instruction, multicultural content may lose the fundamental principles of learning (Qondias et al., 2022). Therefore, implementing a curriculum with roots in multicultural education could be relevant. Without a structural, school-wide curriculum, however, this is left to individual educators who already experience a time-constraint in their curriculum development (Sleeter, 2012). Having multicultural curriculum implementation be dependent on individual research given these limitations could prove to be problematic (Sleeter, 2012). Resistance to Curriculum Nash & Allen (2021) argue that, when implementing an intersectional approach to education, educators will likely be met with resistance due to education inherently being political. Additionally, approaching education with a nontraditional, racialized, and personal stance is an act of resistance in itself, being that the institution of education is deeply rooted in marginalization and discrimination (Nash & Allen, 2021). Regardless of the method in which multicultural education is delivered – whether that be resources, instruction, or the instructor themselves — multicultural education will always be met with criticism and resistance (Marshall, 2015). Educators who believe in employing a multicultural and inclusive education for their students should be mindful of the ways resistance can manifest, and they should anticipate resistance from administrators, parents, students, and their community (Marshall, 2015).  LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 20 Successful Implementations of Multicultural Education  In discussing variations of multicultural education, its applications should also be evaluated for efficacy. Moreso, understanding how multicultural education works, what makes it work, and why it is working is vital to promoting further implementation. Discussed are two applications of multicultural educations; one study examines a multicultural learning model (Qondias et al., 2022), and the other follows the creation of a culturally-responsive curriculum (Castillo, 2023).  Study 1 Multicultural problem-based learning models improve students’ critical thinking skills and social attitudes (Qondias et al., 2022). In a quasi-experimental study with 165 students, one finding suggests that students’ societal attitudes toward their environment are much more positively influenced by problem-based learning (active engagement in the classroom; critical thinking development) as opposed to conventional learning (current standards) (Qondias et al., 2022). The study then advises to converge problem-based learning models with multicultural material to improve social attitudes in students (Qondias et al., 2022). To further this idea, the study found that combining these two entities is effective in improving students’ critical thinking skills (Qondias et al., 2022). It is said that critical thinking skills are developed via a habituation process, where students engage in particular communication patterns, self-reflection, and expressing opinions amongst various classes and groups of people, which becomes more stimulating for the student (Qondias et al., 2022).  Qondias et al. (2022) also found that, when linking problem-based learning models with multicultural material, students’ social attitudes and critical thinking skills grew concurrently. LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 21The educator’s implementation, presentation, and knowledge of diversity and multiculturalism strongly influences this aspect, in addition to the operating structure of the model and material (Qondias et al., 2022). Lastly, Qondias et al. (2022) found that teaching multicultural content in the problem-based learning model is far more effective than teaching it without due to its active, engaging nature. In doing so, students are able to apply problem-solving methods to real life situations, including their environments, social justice issues, creating unity, and value-based circumstances in the 21st century (Qondias et al., 2022).  Study 2 Creating effective, new approaches to education can be challenging, particularly when the model being used promotes including many different kinds of people. Castillo (2023) conducted a mini-ethnographic case study of local education stakeholders in creating and proposing a culturally responsive model for curriculum, new courses, and professional development resources. Data was collected via documents, observations of, and interviews with participants, which in turn was interpreted through a qualitative data analysis software. Important concepts developed by the participants of this study included membership and training, a mission statement, meeting procedures, and goal implementation (Castillo, 2023).  Despite conflicts in timing, most participants were committed to attending their monthly meetings to discuss equity, issues in implementing equity work, and learning more about culturally responsive practices; however, student and family participation proved to be a complication (Castillo, 2023). The group also experienced a lack of diverse representation, as there were only one to three members of color present at any given time, and there were no families of color involved (Castillo, 2023). This proved to be an issue being that a primary goal of the stakeholder group was to engage diverse populations in stakeholder positions (Castillo, LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 222023). Amid their struggles, the group made great advancements qualitatively in culturally responsive education for their local school district (Castillo, 2023). Much like the title of the study, working toward equity remains very difficult to do. However, this study demonstrates that working toward equity and culturally responsive education is a lengthy, yet vitally important process. Though the group encountered complications, their progress was significant to improving their school district (Castillo, 2023).  Multicultural Literature for Youth  In discussing the effect of multicultural literature on youth, it is important to know what exactly is being shown in children’s books. Representations alone are very impactful on a child’s idea of the world around them (Hurley, 2005). However, the messages associated with these representations are equally as significant (Adams & Barratt-Pugh, 2020). Thus, finding what children are presently viewing in their literature is essential to beginning to understand their ideas of themselves and others. Physical Representations An image can convey an implicit message about a person, but unfortunately, only few studies have attempted to determine what images are being shown in children’s literature (Szasz et al., 2022). Of 113 books sampled by Sableski & Arnold (2021), there were only nine books that “represented diversity.” 2,413 children’s books were examined by Adam & Barratt-Pugh (2020) in Australia; 80% of which were “not reflective of cultural diversity.” Further, of the 20% that were culturally diverse, many primarily reflected the views of the dominant culture and depicted “stereotypical, superficial or outdated views of minority cultures,” (Adam & Barratt-Pugh, 2020). Szasz et al. (2022) developed a method to measure racial representation in LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 23children’s books by training artificial intelligence to identify race via face detection – including illustrated works. The race most frequently represented in children’s literature, from the 1920s to the 2010, is White (Szasz et al., 2022). In fact, Adukia et al. (2022) found white women are the most widely represented individuals in children’s literature. The least likely race to appear in children’s literature, according to facial detection, is “Latinx + Others,” (Szasz et al., 2022). All race classifications, including Asian, Black, and Latinx + Others, never exceeded fifteen thousand identified faces across three different classifications; conversely, White faces were identified no less than fifteen-thousand times, with numbers meeting or exceeding thirty thousand (Szasz et al., 2022).  Societal Representations To more closely understand how characters of all cultures are being portrayed in children’s literature, one must look past physical representation and evaluate what messages are being delivered in inclusive material. It is important that children’s literature depicts non-dominant cultures with an authentic perspective (Adams & Barratt-Pugh, 2020). Having physical representations of a variety of cultures while maintaining stereotypes or other harmful narratives can, and likely will, instill such ideas in children and allow for further perpetuation of negative ideas towards others (Adams & Barratt-Pugh, 2020). For example, mainstream children’s books often associate black women with negative connotations more regularly, whereas White women have positive associations (Adukia et al., 2022). Factors such as this can limit a child’s ability to branch their understanding of the world and culture, including impairing their ability to foster meaningful, positive relationships with children of differing multicultural backgrounds (Hurley, 2005). Books that prioritize equity, underrepresented characters, and different perspectives tend to showcase all characters in a positive light (Adukia et al., 2022).  LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 24 Application to School Counseling  By providing culturally congruent resources and services to students, school counselors can begin to meet the needs of students that are left unaddressed by children’s literature and classroom content (Conner & Yeh, 2018). In order to accumulate an appropriate repertoire of resources, a school counselor must understand what their students are consuming. Further, school counselors should evaluate what the content of children’s literature is portraying and implicating about oneself and others (Adams & Barratt-Pugh, 2020). Understanding the state of children’s literature and general societal attitudes can lead a school counselor to begin understanding the gaps in a student’s needs. To utilize this understanding can aide a school counselor in providing supports, rooted in multicultural approaches, to further encourage a student’s social, emotional, and academic achievements (Conner & Yeh, 2018).  Discussion Self-Perception Related to Inclusion and Multiculturalism  Books are sometimes windows, offering views of worlds that may be real or imagined, familiar or strange. These windows are also sliding glass doors, and readers have only to walk through in imagination to become part of whatever world has been created or recreated by the author. When lighting conditions are just right, however, a window can also be a mirror. Literature transforms human experience and reflects it back to us, and in that reflection we can see our own lives and experiences as part of the larger human experience. Reading, then, becomes a means of self-affirmation, and readers often seek their mirrors in books (Bishop, 1990, as cited in McNair & Edwards, 2021). LITERATURE AND YOUTH SELF-PERCEPTION  KNUTSON 25 The identities of characters in children’s literature provide implicit and explicit messages about societal roles and a person’s potential (Szasz et al., 2022). The way that these identities are represented and portrayed can subconsciously influence the way children think about people who are different from them – whether that be positively or negatively (Adukia et al., 2022). For some children, these representations are practically obsolete. Animals as main characters are more frequently depicted as a main character as opposed to a character of an ethnic minority group (Adam & Barratt-Pugh, 2020).  Children can gain a strong sense of identity and pride when presented with literature that reflects their culture; however, this pride could become inflated if one culture is presented more frequently than others, especially if the dominant culture associated with being better or more normal (Adam, 2021). Alternatively, children can discover similarities and differences between themselves and others, and they can begin to learn to value each of these factors (Harper & Brand, 2010). Having conversations about multicultural literature help children foster a meaningful understanding of themselves, their community, and other communities of which they are unfamiliar (Gunn et al., 2022). Further, inclusive material can help alleviate the negative, unsafe nature of schools, particularly for LGBTQ+ youth (Clark & Kosciw, 2022).  Incorporating multicultural education and inclusive literature is integral for positive self-perception and perception of others’ identities (Harper & Brand, 2010; DePaoli et al., 2021), albeit not necessarily the most attainable option for many educators. Making diverse literary pieces and other representative resources widespread across classrooms and schools, however, is the most dependable way to instill positive ideas in children (Sableski & Arnold, 2021).

    "abstract": "This Capstone Project addresses the use of multicultural representation in children’s literature, with particular relevance to educational resources and curriculum. Likewise, there is consideration of the impact of societal attitudes towards multicultural education and acts of inclusivity on the implementation of such ideas. Societal attitudes mentioned include state legislature and literature censorship. The implementation of multicultural education would inherently represent larger numbers of underrepresented communities and individuals, which would then be included in the classroom. This Capstone looks to understand the potential impact of thorough implementation of multicultural education and inclusive, representative literature for youth",
