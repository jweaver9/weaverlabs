To date, ‘queer criminology’ remains a loose collection of studies and criminal-justice related commentary that uses the term 'queer'. Amid the growing calls for the more substantial development of these criminological studies, it is timely to reflect on the ways that the term ‘queer’ has been used in these discourses, to what ends, and with what effects. This paper considers the manner in which the term 'queer' has been used in these criminological and criminal justice discourses. It suggests that ‘queer’ has been used in two dominant ways: as an 'umbrella' term for lesbian, gay, bisexual, intersex, and queer-identified people; and to signify the use of theoretical tools with which to represent sexuality- and gender-diverse people more effectively within criminological research. The paper will argue that these ways of using ‘queer’ have a variety of implications and effects. Specifically, using ‘queer’ as an umbrella term has the potential to reinforce identity categories and the politics that surround identities (a critique that has often appeared in queer contexts), while using it as a theoretical tool potentially reproduces various investments in criminology and criminal justice institutions. Both uses may preclude other productive avenues for critique opened up by the term ‘queer’. The paper will conclude by suggesting that using ‘queer’ as a verb to signify a more deconstructive project directed towards criminology is a possible direction for these discussions. While this approach has its own effects, and articulates with existing deconstructive approaches in criminology, it is important to explore these possibilities at this point in the development of a ‘queer/ed criminology’ for two The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 2  reasons: it highlights that multiple, and often competing, ‘queer/ed criminologies’ exist; and it expands the diverse possibilities heralded by the notion of ‘queer’.  Introduction The term ‘queer’ is being employed with greater frequency in research on particular criminal justice issues, as well as in broader theoretical reflections on how a ‘queer/ed criminology’ might proceed (Tomsen 1997; Groombridge 1999; Woods forthcoming; Ball forthcoming). However, ‘queer’ is a contested term, and there are numerous debates as to what it refers, and how it can and should be used (Sullivan 2003; Jagose 1996). ‘Queer’ largely refers to an intellectual approach that seeks to deconstruct binaries such as homosexual/heterosexual or male/female and their institutionalisation in a variety of social sites (see Butler 1990; Sedgwick 1990). These studies developed out of numerous radical political movements focused on HIV activism, as well as those that sought to critique the assimilationist and often essentialising tendencies of many gay and lesbian political struggles. Queer theorists critique essentialist understandings of identity – particularly in the context of sexuality and gender – and prefer to explore the historical contingencies through which sexuality and gender are formed and regulated (see Foucault 1998; Sullivan 2003; Jagose 1996). However, a substantial amount of queer theoretical work takes the view that ‘queer’ denotes an attitude or a position, especially in relation to what is taken to be ‘normal’. As Sullivan (2003: 52) highlights, dictionary definitions of ‘queer’ often define it as ‘to quiz or ridicule, to spoil, to put out of order’. While many authors focus on deconstructing or ‘queering’ norms of sexuality and gender (Duggan 2001: 223; Smith in Sullivan 2003: 43) – an approach that, as will be discussed below, is also dominant in criminological discourses – others suggest that the constituency of ‘queer’ is open-ended, and thus what connects those working in this area is their shared position vis-à-vis norms and normativity, not just sexuality and gender (Jagose 1996: 98; Sullivan 2003: 43; Giffney 2004: 73-74). The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 3  Thus, the primary strategy of many queer theorists is denaturalisation, and the confounding and unpacking of categories, pulling apart essences, oppositions, and foundational assumptions to understand how particular phenomena or questions about our social world have been constructed in the ways they have been (Jagose 1996: 98; Sullivan 2003: 50-51). In this vein, David Halperin suggests that ‘queer’ ‘...acquires its meaning from its oppositional relation to the norm. ‘Queer’ is by definition whatever is at odds with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant. There is nothing in particular to which it necessarily refers’ (Halperin 1995: 62, emphases in original). ‘Queer’ can therefore be a position in relation to the norm, rather than a positivity (Halperin 1995: 62). As such, for many theorists, ‘queer’ refers to more than simply deconstructing assumptions surrounding sexuality and gender, but extends to a wide variety of concepts.1 Thus, it is clear that there is not one definition of ‘queer’, or that there is a shared understanding of what the proper object(s) of ‘queer’ might be. As these debates over what ‘queer’ refers to are unsettled and every citation of the term mobilises a particular understanding of ‘queer’, reproducing the specific effects that attend to that understanding along the way, this paper does not seek to pin down a definition of ‘queer’. Rather, it explores the ways that the term ‘queer’ has been used in criminal justice discourses, and charts some of the implications of these different uses.2 It identifies two primary uses of the term ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses: ‘queer’ as an umbrella term doing the work of an identity category (‘queer’ as noun); and ‘queer’ as signifying a set of theoretical tools mobilised to effectively understand and represent sexuality and gender diversity in criminological research (what might be thought of here as ‘queer’ as ‘sensitising concept’). It then explores the implications of each of these different citations of the term and concludes by highlighting that one use of ‘queer’ that is largely overlooked in these discussions is its use as a verb, to signify a position or attitude. It suggests that there is scope in criminological discussions to further utilise such an understanding of ‘queer’. In offering this analysis, the paper does not seek to police the ways that the term ‘queer’ is used in criminal justice discourses, nor to be prescriptive in its use, but rather to extend the range of debate about its use, and, as Judith Butler puts it, ‘...make us consider at what expense and for what purposes [it is] used’ (Butler The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 4  1993: 229). Reflecting on, and articulating with greater precision, the understanding of ‘queer’ that is being mobilised must become a central part of any conversation about the use of the term in criminological and criminal justice discourses for two primary reasons: because it is apparent that there are multiple, and indeed competing, ‘queer/ed criminologies’ that ought not be confused; and it expands the diverse possibilities heralded by the notion of ‘queer’ and its use in criminology. This paper seeks to initiate a conversation on these issues.  The Uses of ‘Queer’ ‘Queer’ as Noun The term ‘queer’ has been employed in some criminal justice discourses as a noun – that is, to refer to an identity category or umbrella of identity categories under which lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer-identifying (LGBTIQ) people may be placed, or along the lines of which they might identify. Commonly, the term is used ‘almost simply’ (Sedgwick 2011: 200, emphasis in original) to refer to same-sex sexuality, but it is also used as a substitute for the unwieldy initialism of LGBTIQ (Duggan 2001: 224). ‘Queer’ is used in this way in academic research such as Queering Conflict: Examining Lesbian and Gay Experiences of Homophobia in Northern Ireland (Duggan 2012), Queer (In)justice: The Criminalisation of LGBT People in the United States (Mogul et al. 2011), and Intimate Partner Violence in LGBTQ Lives (Ristock 2011), to name a few. These works address criminological problems of relevance to LGBTIQ-identified people – whether this is a unique crime that is experienced by them (hate crimes, for example), a crime conventionally studied by criminologists but where these communities have been overlooked (such as intimate partner violence), or a particular (usually negative) experience of one aspect of the criminal justice system (such as the impacts of policing or prison). They comprehensively discuss the problems, forms of discrimination, inequalities, and experiences of LGBTIQ-identified people in their interactions with the justice system. And this research is often geared towards addressing these injustices, and reforming the practices that are understood as problematic. The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 5  This particular use of ‘queer’ also appears in recent attempts to forge a ‘queer criminology’. Jordan Blair Woods, for instance, has suggested that ‘queer criminology’ would provide a space in which ‘LGBTQ people’ can represent themselves within criminological conversations, be recognised as part of these conversations, and ensure that accurate and appropriate understandings of themselves are furthered in this field. The desire of such a project appears to be to ‘[reorient] the focus of criminological inquiry to give due consideration to the relationship between sexual orientation/gender identity and victimization, offending, and desistance from crime’ (Woods forthcoming). This use of ‘queer’ – as an umbrella identity category, or as a way of referring to a group of people – is productive. It allows for those with shared experiences by virtue of their existing outside of heteronormativity to be represented in research. It also allows researchers and others to bring criminological attention to bear on issues of injustice, or to important silences in these discourses, and open up a space for these injustices to be remedied, or these silences to be broken.  ‘Queer’ as ‘Sensitising Concept’ ‘Queer’ has also been used in these discourses to signify the application of some theoretical perspectives or conclusions from queer theory in criminological analyses. The variety of research projects here have utilised queer theoretical insights about non-essentialised identities and the fluidity of sexualities and genders – the primary focus of many queer theoretical analyses – to understand the subjects of the research, while also exposing the troubling binaries that underpin criminological thought or exploring the heteronormative regulation of sexuality and how this intersects with crime and justice. For example, queer theoretical discussions about the government of sexuality through the norms embedded in various social sites have been used to explore the regulation and often criminalisation of those that live non-heteronormative or non-cisgendered lives, particularly as this occurs through the law and aspects of the justice system (Dwyer 2012: 18; Mogul et al. 2011: 23; Narrain 2008: 51; Duggan 1993: 75; Umphrey 1995: 26; Stychin 1995: 7; Moran et al. 1998; Robson 2011; The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 6  Dalton 2007; Dalton 2006; Mason 2001; Backus 2009; Tomsen 2006: 393-394). Other works look at how forms of surveillance regulate the ‘normal’ use of public space and govern public sex (Conrad 2009; see also Johnson and Dalton 2012). And still others look at the regulation of other forms of sexual activity or sexual visibilities (Dalton 2007; Dalton 2006; Mason 2001; Lamble 2009), explore how criminology might engage with these concerns, and how criminal justice might be better achieved. The queer theoretical analysis of essentialised identities has also been used to critique the understandings of victims and perpetrators (not to mention the binarised understandings of homosexual and heterosexual) that appear in knowledge about, and current approaches to address, hate crimes (Tomsen 2006: 394; Tomsen 2009: 10-13, 15; Tomsen 1997: 39, 40, 42; Lamble 2008: 29). Additionally, these theoretical tools have been used to understand and represent gender- and sexuality-diverse people in this context. For example, Chakraborti and Garland suggest that such work ‘...is important for developing a framework that can include some of those who are the victims of homophobic and transphobic violence... [because s]uch a framework challenges commonly-held societal assumptions about the demarcation of gender, sexual desire and identity’ (Chakraborti and Garland 2012: 75). In this approach, it is assumed that queer theory can be used to assist in understanding particular groups of people and their lived experiences, representing them effectively within research and policy. These ways of employing the term ‘queer’ – to signify a set of theoretical concepts that can be used in an analysis – are also apparent in some of the more explicit calls for the development of a ‘queer criminology’ that have been made since the mid-1990s. In 1997, for example, Tomsen suggested that the critique of binary thinking that queer theory offers could be put to productive use in criminology, particularly in exploring the way criminology perpetuates the homo/hetero binary and maintains ‘homophobic oppression’ – a task that he suggested was ‘...imperative in any sexually emancipatory politics’ (Tomsen, 1997: 34; see further Tomsen 2006; Tomsen 2009). Tomsen later developed this argument to suggest that such an approach would also include an ‘ongoing emphasis on the performativity of criminalised masculine identities and a progressive psychoanalytic stress on the The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 7  tense proximity of homo and hetero desire that feeds much male aggression, misogyny and risk taking’ (Tomsen 2006: 403). Groombridge also recommended queer criminology should follow Seidman’s suggestion that any analysis informed by queer theory ought to study the ways that ‘...knowledges and social practices... organise “society” as a whole by sexualising – heterosexualising and homosexualising – bodies, desires, acts, identities, social relations, knowledges, culture and social institutions’ (Seidman in Groombridge 1999: 533). While this paper can only begin to explore the way the term ‘queer’ has been employed in these discourses, it is apparent that one consistent feature of these uses is that they signify a mobilisation of the concepts of queer theory in ways that assume that these concepts offer accurate ways of understanding and representing gender- and sexuality-diverse people. Not only do these concepts allow researchers to appreciate the impact of heteronormative discourses and regulations in the field of criminal justice, but they offer researchers what might be considered ‘sensitising concepts’ in order to become attuned to the complexities of sexuality and gender diversity. In themselves, such analyses provide novel critiques of various criminal justice issues, and new directions for criminological discourses to follow.  Implications of These Uses of ‘Queer’ As discussed, each of these ways of using the term ‘queer’ is productive. However, they also have a variety of potential impacts – they can lead to particular courses of action and ways of thinking, and preclude others. While the term ‘queer’ is often used productively as an umbrella term to signify a range of identities, this way of using the term has been critiqued as a ‘false but unifying umbrella’ (Giffney 2009: 2), producing the homogenisation of those that are considered to fit under it. It can erase very important differences along the lines of race, ethnicity, and class that exist between those that might be considered ‘queer’ (Anzaldúa in Sullivan 2003: 44). Additionally, this use of the term as, for all intents and purposes, an identity category, can lead to essentialised understandings about people, and, by extension, lead to problematic forms of identity politics (Giffney 2009: 2; Anzaldúa in Sullivan 2003: 44; Sedgwick 2011: 200). The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 8  These questions about the political utility or strategic necessity of contingent identity categories is an ongoing (and perhaps unresolvable) issue in queer politics (see Gamson 1995; Butler 1993). A large part of queer theorising has developed as a response to and critique of essentialised understandings of sexuality, gender, and identity, with many people that identify as queer embracing this understanding (Jagose 1996: 77-78). Using ‘queer’ as an identity category in order to include these people in particular forms of research does allow for the production of knowledge about their experiences of a particular crime, but can effectively reintroduce essentialised understandings of identity into these discussions (Gamson 1995). This is partly because the deconstruction that attends many queer identities – and which is the basis for this stance against essentialism – is not carried further and directed towards other concepts in the research. Put simply, the people explored in the research are ‘queer’, but other aspects of the research are not (see further Ball and Scherer 2011: 1-2). This argument can be illustrated in the context of intimate partner violence. There is a growing body of research that charts the incidence of such violence in the lives of ‘queers’, and some of this work engages with queer theoretical insights insofar as they point out that our discourses about such violence are heteronormative, or that identities are not stable. However, in much of this research, the understanding of violence itself is not ‘queered’, and remains heteronormative or, indeed, homonormative (see Ball 2013; Holmes 2009).3 A related point can be made about the ways that ‘queer’ is used to signify the mobilisation of queer theoretical concepts and tools to understand sexuality and gender diversity in these criminal justice discourses. These queer theoretical concepts and tools are used primarily to assist in the understanding of, and the appropriate representation of, gender- and sexuality-diverse people. However, this representation and understanding takes place within what remain largely conventional criminological analyses. Thus, while queer theoretical insights are used here to guide research in theoretically sophisticated ways and allow for a critical examination of the problematic assumptions that have long characterised the engagement with these issues within criminal justice discourses, the deconstructive critiques that queer theory can offer may be restricted. These queer theoretical tools are used to assist in understanding the subjects of research, and to appreciate the forms of regulation and normalisation that impact upon them, thereby contributing to The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 9  the development of knowledge about these people and their experiences, and to the development of more effective policies to address injustice. However, this deconstructive critique is not often turned towards criminology itself, its own project of producing such knowledge, and its attendant effects. To illustrate this, consider, for example, Chakraborti and Garland’s statement (2012: 75) that in the context of hate crime, queer theoretical work ‘...is important for developing a framework that can include some of those who are the victims of homophobic and transphobic violence...’. Here, queer theory allows for a more effective representation of victims of hate crime, and is mobilised in projects that seek both criminological knowledge production about this crime, as well as the development of more effective responses to it. Groombridge’s suggestion that queer criminological work be situated ‘...squarely within mainstream criminological concerns, not on the criminological margins’ (Groombridge 1999: 543), and be directed towards producing explanations about criminal justice issues, are further possible examples of this kind of dynamic (Groombridge 1999: 539). Identifying the implications of these uses of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses is not intended to suggest that these are negative or undesirable uses of the term ‘queer’. The incorporation of queer theory into criminological research can allow for the development of interventions that respond more effectively to the injustices that are the concern of many of these researchers, and the use of ‘queer’ as an umbrella identity category can allow for criminological attention to be turned towards important injustices. The critique offered here is intended only to point out that these uses of the term have a variety of implications, and these can place limits on the critique and deconstruction that is possible in criminal justice discourses. It is also to point out that other productive uses of the term ‘queer’ are possible, along which ‘queer/ed criminologies’ might proceed.  Queer as a Verb? One possible way of using ‘queer’, discussed above, is as a verb – as signifying a position or an attitude. To say that this particular approach is not widely apparent in criminology is not to say that the work discussed above is not critical or The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 10  deconstructive. Rather, it is to argue that these analyses that use the term ‘queer’ often limit the deconstructive potential of ‘queer’ in some ways and thus still engage in what might be thought of as conventional criminological projects. This becomes apparent when one considers that regardless of whether ‘queer’ has been used as an identity category or as a set of ‘sensitising concepts’, it is continually connected to sexuality and gender, and these appear to remain the proper objects of these queer criminological analyses. So, criminological research most often mobilises ‘queer’ if the population of concern within the research are ‘queer’ people (experiencing hate crime or violence, for example), or if the focus is on the regulation of sexuality or gender identity, or if the particular activity explored has a sexual aspect to it (such as pornography, or sex work). Other aspects of the research are not ‘queered’, the attachment of ‘queer’ to gender and sexuality is not problematised (see Eng 2005: 3), and the possibilities of ‘queering’ other concepts in the research more broadly are not fully developed (see the example of intimate partner violence above). By suggesting that the ways that ‘queer’ is used still engages to varying degress in conventional criminological projects merely suggests that many of them are still tied to forms of knowledge production, or to achieving criminal justice, and often still invested in criminal justice institutions. They help to provide a ground for knowing about a particular topic, and do not use ‘queer’ to signify a more thoroughly deconstructive project that could shift more fundamentally the ground upon which such criminology – or, indeed, criminologists themselves – stand. Such an approach might not just use queer insights to argue that criminology is heteronormative, but also use ‘queer’ as a position from which to highlight the costs of investing in criminology in the interests of ‘queers’. Using ‘queer’ as a verb within these discourses could help avoid these kinds of investment. Such a project would, of course, carry its own dangers, and certainly some are troubled by any move away from sexuality and gender within queer analyses (Halley and Parker 2011: 6). Using ‘queer’ as an impetus for deconstruction of this kind may push these criminal justice discourses in directions that criminologists may perceive as irrelevant, or outside the bounds of what is taken to be criminology. Deconstructive projects of this kind might also be perceived as being of little relevance to addressing immediate material injustices (for preliminary responses to The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 11  this critique, see Ball forthcoming; Cohen 1998: 117). And, of course, articulating whether this way of using ‘queer’ interacts with, replicates, draws from, challenges, reinvigorates, or indeed ‘queers’ existing deconstructive approaches in criminology must be explored (Cohen 1998). However, this approach is potentially a fruitful direction for criminologists, and is certainly one among many possible ‘queer/ed criminologies’.  Conclusion This paper has briefly explored the two dominant ways that the notion of ‘queer’ is utilised in criminal justice discourses, and pointed to some of the implications of these uses. It has highlighted that ‘queer’ is primarily used either to refer to an identity, or to signify a set of conceptual tools. It has also identified the implications of these different uses of the term, and suggested that an alternative conception of ‘queer’ – where it signifies a disposition or attitude – could be productively utilised in this field. These discussions contribute to the development of a ‘queer/ed criminology’ – or what might more appropriately be termed ‘queer/ed criminologies’ – by encouraging authors engaging in such projects, or employing the term, to reflect on how they use the term, and the various implications of doing so. As each use of the term carries with it particular assumptions and can preclude other ways of thinking or acting, ultimately producing different kinds of criminological analyses, being attendant to the effects of their use of the term can allow for a more informed discussion about the possibilities of ‘queer/ed criminologies’, and the ways that ‘queer’ might be most effectively mobilised. The slipperiness of ‘queer’ highlighted in this paper is advantageous to criminal justice discourses, and not something that ought to be foreclosed. As Judith Butler points out, the term needs to ‘...be vanquished by those who are excluded by the term but who justifiably expect representation by it’, by those who use it in different ways, in order ‘...to let it take on meanings that cannot now be anticipated’, and also by those ‘...whose political vocabulary may well carry a very different set of investments’ (Butler 1993: 230). Perhaps the only thing that is certain among this The use of ‘queer’ in criminal justice discourses 12  variety of ways of using ‘queer’ is that ‘[q]ueer, if it names anything, names a critical impulse that can never, must never, settle’ (Kemp 2009: 22).

    "abstract": "Within criminological literature, there are growing references to a 'queer/ed criminology'. To date, ‘queer criminology’ remains a loose collection of studies and criminal-justice related commentary that uses the term 'queer'. Amid the growing calls for the more substantial development of these criminological studies, it is timely to reflect on the ways that the term ‘queer’ has been used in these discourses, to what ends, and with what effects. This paper considers the manner in which the term 'queer' has been used in these criminological and criminal justice discourses. It suggests that ‘queer’ has been used in two dominant ways: as an 'umbrella' term for lesbian, gay, bisexual, intersex, and queer-identified people; and to signify the use of theoretical tools with which to represent sexuality- and gender-diverse people more effectively within criminological research. The paper will argue that these ways of using ‘queer’ have a variety of implications and effects. Specifically, using ‘queer’ as an umbrella term has the potential to reinforce identity categories and the politics that surround identities (a critique that has often appeared in queer contexts), while using it as a theoretical tool potentially reproduces various investments in criminology and criminal justice institutions. Both uses may preclude other productive avenues for critique opened up by the term ‘queer’. The paper will conclude by suggesting that using ‘queer’ as a verb to signify a more deconstructive project directed towards criminology is a possible direction for these discussions. While this approach has its own effects, and articulates with existing deconstructive approaches in criminology, it is important to explore these possibilities at this point in the development of a ‘queer/ed criminology’ for two reasons: it highlights that multiple, and often competing, ‘queer/ed criminologies’ exist; and it expands the diverse possibilities heralded by the notion of ‘queer’",
