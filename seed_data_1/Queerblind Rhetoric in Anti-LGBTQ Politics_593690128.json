    "fullText": "Queerblind Rhetoric in Anti-LGBTQ PoliticsNatalie RyanUndergraduate StudentDepartment of Political ScienceUniversity of Colorado UCB 333Boulder, CO 80309Defense Date: April 10, 2023Thesis Advisor:Michaele Ferguson, Department of Political ScienceDefense Committee:Jennifer Fitzgerald, Department of Political ScienceLisa Flores, Department of Communications1AbstractAnti-LGBTQ movements have gone through different phases in the United States as they havetargeted homosexuality generally, same-sex marriage, and same-sex adoption. Despite theincreasing acceptance and visibility of LGBTQ identities over the past twenty years, thisanti-LGBTQ movement continues today, targeting what kids learn about in schools and LGBTQyouth generally. In this thesis, I research how opponents of LGBTQ rights frame their argumentsin order to appeal to a more tolerant American public. Specifically, I analyze the rhetoric ofanti-LGBTQ curriculum policies and anti-LGBTQ activism from 2022 and from an earlierperiod spanning from the 1970s to the early 2000s. I find that both policies and activism havechanged their rhetoric to become more queerblind – intentionally avoiding terms or assigningvalue to LGBTQ identities. This queerblind theory is further developed by looking at howscholars have analyzed racially colorblind rhetoric that is more prevalent in modern-day racismand rhetoric. I argue that queerblind rhetoric has become more prevalent due to a more tolerantpublic and due to queerblindness being a more politically strategic opposition to the LGBTQrights movement.2I. Introduction: Why Study Queerblindness?The past few decades have seen a huge wave of LGBTQ reforms, from outlawingsodomy laws in 2003 to legalizing gay marriage in 2015. Public support has also increased assupport towards lesbians and gay people doubled in the last three decades and support fortransgender people increased by 40% from 2005 to 2011 (Flores, 2014). But despite thesesuccesses, there have been some notable setbacks to the LGBTQ community, especiallyconcerning schools and LGBTQ youth, with LGBTQ education being the most controversialissue for parents in public schools (Miller & Paris, 2022).This has led to increasing “Don’t Say Gay” bills, book bannings, laws allowing parents toopt out of inclusivity lessons, and policies barring trans youth from bathrooms, locker rooms,and sports teams aligning with their gender identity. This shift towards more anti-LGBTQpolicies has been described as a countermovement, one primarily run by the Christian Right(Wilcox, 2020). The successes of the gay rights movement and the progressive changes in thelaw have led to a cultural backlash against LGBTQ rights whose impact today is seen incontrolling what kids learn about in the classroom. What is less clear is how this backlash gainedso much support.Queerblind TheoryHow Do Opponents of LGBTQ Rights Frame Their Arguments?This thesis investigates why, despite clear public support for LGBTQ communities, arethese anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws getting passed. Since the 1990s, gay marriage has beendeemed more and more acceptable with 71% of Americans believing that it should be recognizedby the law as valid in May 2022, compared to only 50% in 2012 and 34% in 2000 (Gallup,2023). Even more conservative-leaning states like Nebraska have public opinion surveys siding3against LGBTQ discrimination, with 64% of people opposing laws that allow business owners todeny services to gay people (Kazyak, Burke, & Stange, 2018). It is clear that people arebecoming more accepting of LGBTQ rights, so why are contemporary anti-LGBTQ laws sosuccessful?In order to investigate this question of why, I am asking how the laws and the issuesthemselves are framed to appeal to contemporary Americans. Since public opinion overall hasbecome more accepting of LGBTQ rights, the reason for the laws’ success is not in how thepublic has changed but in how the laws and anti-LGBTQ activists frame their arguments toappeal to wider, more tolerant audiences. This means looking into the ways the policies arewritten and how the anti-LGBTQ activists talk about these issues. Through investigating theanti-LGBTQ frameworks, I hope to gain insight into the contemporary backlash against LGBTQrights that uses young people and schools as targets for changing the culture of LGBTQacceptance.Queerblind FrameworksThe main theory I propose as an answer to the question of how anti-LGBTQ argumentsare framed is that they use what I call queerblind frameworks. Queerblind frameworks refer toany argumentative frameworks that either avoid using terms related to gender and sexuality orany argument that attempts to appear neutral and unbiased against LGBTQ people. Thisframework is comparable to colorblind arguments which have been analyzed by scholars in thepast as a way to understand contemporary racism. Colorblind frameworks similarly avoid racialterms and deny systemic racism in order to oppose racial progress. Though I do not believe thatrace and LGBTQ issues are interchangeable, nor would I claim that “gay is the new black” assome have purported (Kearl, 2015), I do think that the colorblind framework is a good way to4understand anti-LGBTQ arguments and unpack the complex layers of discriminationexperienced by marginalized communities.In order to understand queerblind rhetoric, I analyze the different anti-LGBTQ argumentsand identify the different ways in which they are used. Arguments calling homosexuality a sinversus arguments claiming LGBTQ rights limit religious freedom may have the same goal, butone appears far more tolerant than the other. I propose that more and more arguments try toappear less homophobic or transphobic by basing their logic on something other than LGBTQidentities being inherently immoral. As with colorblind rhetoric becoming more popular overtime, I also hope to show how queerblind rhetoric has grown more popular by looking at theframeworks used in the 1990s compared to frameworks used today.How to Study QueerblindnessIn order to study queerblindness, I focus on anti-LGBTQ policies and activism first fromthe 1990s and then from the more recent wave in 2022. By analyzing policies and activism fromthese two time periods, I uncover to what degree queerblindness is a newer phenomenon or onethat has existed for a while. I argue that the reason contemporary anti-LGBTQ laws are moresuccessful is because they have become more queerblind.Before going into the research itself, in Chapter 2, I more thoroughly develop my theoryof queerblind rhetoric by identifying the different anti-LGBTQ frameworks and by investigatingthe connection between colorblindness and queerblindness. Through looking at colorblindrhetoric, I gain insight into how scholars have investigated colorblind rhetoric and frameworks.This serves as a basis for my own theory of queerblindness as it will indicate the different waysthat queerblind arguments may manifest as well as how they could differ from racialcolorblindness.5In Chapter 3, I rhetorically analyze anti-LGBTQ curriculum policies from the 1990s up totoday. Rather than looking at all types of anti-LGBTQ policies, I focus solely on curriculum lawsas those have grown in prominence in the past few years and can be compared to earlier laws ofthe 1990s, unlike the laws targeting transgender youth which have only been enacted in the lastfew years, and therefore cannot be analyzed in how they have changed over time. I analyze theanti-LGBTQ curriculum policies across the U.S. that are either still technically on the books orusing significantly queerblind or queer-conscious language. By investigating the same kind oflaw over different spans of time, I see the full spectrum of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric used in policies.In Chapter 4, I investigate how activism has changed over time, broadly looking atactivism beginning in the 1970s up to today. By looking at two different time periods ofactivism, I am again able to see the full range of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and see how rhetoric hasbecome more queerblind over time. Unlike previous research, I am investigating secularanti-LGBTQ groups as well as the activism of the religious right in order to understand how bothtypes frame their arguments. By looking at these different forms of activism, I hope to show howanti-LGBTQ activism may provide queerblind frameworks that are different from those used inpolicy rhetoric, as policies use more elitist, “unbiased” language. Through analyzing the differentforms of anti-LGBTQ activism, I show how queerblindness can appear in more religiousframeworks as well as in secular frameworks.In the concluding chapter, I hope to give some answers as to whether queerblindnessexists, and more importantly, how best to respond to this change in rhetoric against LGBTQpeople. Through analyzing these arguments and recognizing the underlying frameworks in thisway, I hope to show what is so appealing about these arguments and what that may say about theculture as a whole with regard to LGBTQ rights.6II. Literature Review and Queerblind TheoryIn order to support my claim that opponents of LGBTQ rights use queerblind rhetoric topass anti-LGBTQ laws, I investigate the connection between colorblind racism and queerblindarguments. Colorblind racism uses race-neutral terms in order to deny systemic racism andoppose racial reforms. Queerblind rhetoric works to pass discriminatory laws by avoiding termsrelated to LGBTQ identities and by denying any homophobic or transphobic intentions. In orderto develop and understand queerblindness, I look to colorblind racism as the closest theoreticalconcept to what I am trying to define. Scholars studying colorblind racism have identifiedvarious frameworks of colorblindness and how they are used. I connect these colorblindframeworks to LGBTQ arguments and also show how they may differ. Then, I identify andanalyze the different anti-LGBTQ frameworks and how they can be both queerblind andqueer-conscious. By identifying these frameworks, I can then show how they are used inanti-LGBTQ policies and activism from the 1990s to today.What Colorblind Arguments Teach About QueerblindnessColorblind arguments are those that attempt to take race out of the argument entirely,claiming that race is no longer a systemic issue and that racism only exists in overtlydiscriminatory practices. This kind of racism has always been a part of American history, thoughliterature identifying colorblind racism has only gained traction after the Civil Rights Movement.Eduardo Bonilla-Silva separates colorblind frameworks into four different categories: abstractliberalism, cultural racism, minimization, and naturalization. By looking at Bodilla-Silva’scategorization as well as what other scholars have said, I evaluate how colorblind frameworksare used and what that may tell us about queerblindness.Abstract Liberalism7Abstract liberalism uses concepts related to political and economic liberalism to opposepractical efforts toward racial equality. This can mean using ideas like equal opportunity tooppose affirmative action or ideas like individualism and meritocracies to defend white privilege.By framing racial issues in this way, the arguments appear more reasonable and morally sound(Bonilla-Silva, 2018, pp. 58-64).Abstract liberalism can be seen in laws, as Kimberlé Crenshaw shows in her critique ofanti-discrimination laws from after the Civil Rights Movement. Though these laws provided aformal elimination of racism, they ended up perpetuating a material subordination of blackpeople who continued to feel the ramifications of Jim Crow laws. Though the laws had goodintentions of anti-discrimination, they still assume a kind of meritocracy and equal playing fieldwhich makes racially unequal outcomes more dismissable by the wider public (Crenshaw, 1988).By assuming meritocracy and racial equality outside of formal racism in the law, colorblind lawscan get away with failing to prevent racial discrimination.Anti-LGBTQ policies work differently from these colorblind laws identified byCrenshaw, as the LGBTQ policies do not experience this indirect impact due to systematicoppression. Still, there are other ways in which abstract liberalism is prevalent in anti-LGBTQrhetoric. The use of concepts like “equality” and “freedom” has become more and more popularas a way to delegitimize LGBTQ rights. Groups like Moms for Liberty (2022) ground theirarguments in concepts like parental rights and freedom of speech in order to justify denyingrights to LGBTQ people. Anti-LGBTQ policies also base their logic on abstract liberalism, suchas the Parental Rights in Education Act (2022) using the idea of parental rights to push ananti-LGBTQ agenda. These arguments clearly oppose LGBTQ rights but can appear reasonable8as they do not directly fault LGBTQ identities, only how those identities may decrease freedom,fairness, or equality.Cultural Racism and NaturalizationOther frameworks that Bodilla-Silva identifies are cultural racism and naturalization. Thecultural racism framework uses claims about the culture of minority groups to justify racistgeneralizations. This can mean claiming that some racial groups are lazier or more prone tocrime than others. Cultural racism is built off of the earlier framework of biological racism whichdescribes biological differences between racial groups so that some are superior to others. Thenaturalization framework is similar to cultural racism but instead of citing cultural differences,this framework claims that racial groups naturally want to stick together and do not like tointermix. This is used more when justifying segregation, gentrification, or interracial marriage(Bonilla-Silva, 2018, pp. 64-70). These frameworks are colorblind as they use culture and natureas reasons for racist beliefs rather than openly admitting to viewing minority groups as inferior towhites.The cultural racism framework can be seen in the justification of racially discriminatorylaws and practices that Michelle Alexander investigates in The New Jim Crow: MassIncarceration in the Age of Colorblindness. Alexander looks at colorblind racism within thecriminal justice system and how it has led to racially discriminatory laws and practices. Anexample of this is giving law enforcement the discretion to stop and arrest whomever they wantfor drug charges, leading to conscious or unconscious racial discrimination which cannot bechallenged in a justice system that upholds colorblindness. Alexander argues that this colorblindjustice came about as a way to maintain a racial hierarchy after the Civil Rights Movement bycreating a “race-neutral” language that is able to maintain the caste system from Jim Crow9without mentioning racial groups (p. 50). This new system replaces explicitly racial terms with“law and order” or “hard on crime” ideologies. This led to laws that disproportionately impactblack and minority communities, despite people of color being no more likely to be guilty ofdrug crimes and other offenses than white people. Though the laws themselves do not explicitlyreference cultural differences in minority groups, the dialogue surrounding hard-on-crime lawsoften pointed to some innate cultural differences that caused minorities to be arrested, rather thanlooking at laws and practices themselves. Some of this culturally racist language includesdescribing black women as “welfare queens” and black men as “predatory” in order to justifytheir economic and criminal status as being about culture or nature rather than systemic issues (p.61). This version of cultural racism perpetuates racist practices and justifies existing racist laws,though does not initially appear racist due to the omission of racial terms (Alexander, 2010).Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor similarly talks about the post-civil rights era of colorblindnessand how the rhetoric and framing of colorblind arguments would place the blame of racialdisparity not on institutional racism but on the cultural and moral differences of black and otherminority groups compared to whites. Taylor again gives the example of terms like “welfarequeen” and the “strapping buck” to reference black people, without openly calling them blackstereotypes (p. 52). This language allows people to justify racist policies and practices, and ratherthan blaming the institutions, they blame the “cultural” differences that cause more black peopleto be arrested or impoverished (Taylor, 2016, pp. 51-73). By slyly using terms and stereotypesassociated with racial minorities, these laws and practices are able to appear less racist than theyactually are.This use of culture or nature to defend racist practices can also be seen in how peoplemay indirectly reference queer culture or the nature of queer identities to justify LGBTQ10discrimination. Cultural rhetoric is used when describing queer issues as more sexually explicitand unsuitable for children. This is also seen when gay men and transwomen are described aspredatory or sexually deviant (Bryant, 1977). By denying black people the ability to be seen asfull human beings beyond these cultural stereotypes, people are able to justify economic andcriminal justice disparities. And by denying queer people the same, LGBTQ discrimination cancontinue under the guise of queer sexual deviance. Though both perpetuate untrue and harmfulstereotypes, the political results differ as colorblindness targets crime and economics whilequeerblindness targets schools and job discrimination.MinimizationBodilla-Silva’s minimization framework acknowledges some explicit racial problems, butminimizes racism as a systemic problem in the U.S., suggesting that racism no longer impactsthe opportunities minorities can get. People using this argument will acknowledge obvious racialincidents, but write off other claims of racial discrimination as people being too sensitive and“using the race card” (Bonilla-Silva, 2018, pp. 70-74). Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor (2018) alsodescribes how this minimization of racism is used to “elevate and amplify politics that blameBlacks for their own oppression” (p. 72). The colorblindness here is in the denial of systemicracism, and using that colorblind ignorance to justify not addressing racism on a systemic level.Minimization can also be found outside of politics and inside educational institutionswith authors like Mica Pollock investigating how teachers, parents, and administrators argueagainst race-conscious practices in schools. He finds that many argue that acknowledging racemakes for more harm than good, and it is not so much of a problem to have to be brought up inschools. Within the particular schools that Pollock looked at, he found that the main issue wasthe belief that there is no lack of opportunities for students of color, thereby maintaining that11schools should be colorblind (Pollock, 2010). These schools claim race is not so much of aproblem in contemporary society, so it should not be talked about in schools. This is raciallycolorblind as it acknowledges that racism exists, but denies its wider impact on individuals andin schools and society at large.This minimization framework is also found in some anti-LGBTQ arguments. In the1990s, many people described anti-discrimination laws for LGBTQ people as unnecessary, withgroups like the Christian Coalition calling them “special rights” (Reed, 1990, p. 91). Thisdelegitimizes LGBTQ rights and minimizes the discrimination queer people face. Today, peoplemay still minimize the importance of LGBTQ rights by showing acceptance towards some rights(i.e. marriage) but find other rights to be too political (i.e. LGBTQ education in schools). Thoughboth these frameworks acknowledge discrimination and bigotry in particular instances butminimize systemic and cultural problems in order to deny any extension of rights.Colorblind FrameworksThe four frameworks of abstract liberalism, cultural racism, naturalization, andminimization all deny racism as a systemic issue in order to perpetuate racially discriminatorypractices and pass racially discriminatory laws. Though colorblindness manifests in thesedifferent ways, it consistently makes efforts towards denying racism and avoiding overtly racistrhetoric. These same ideas can be found in queerblindness as it similarly avoids bigoted languageand minimizes the importance of LGBTQ rights. I continue to look to colorblind frameworks asan analytical tool for how queerblind frameworks and queerblind language may play out inpolicies and activism.Anti-LGBTQ Arguments12I argue that queerblindness underlies many anti-LGBTQ strategies, but despite this, thereare a number of overtly homophobic and transphobic arguments still being made today. Becauseof this, this section not only examines queerblind arguments but looks at queer-consciousarguments that make overt claims about the validity and morality of LGBTQ identities. I analyzesix different anti-LGBTQ frameworks and identify their various degrees of queerblind rhetoric.To start, I evaluate the frameworks that intentionally describe LGBTQ identities as wrong, usingbiblical arguments and heteroactivist arguments. Then, I look at the more queerblind frameworkswhich include sexualization arguments, religious freedom arguments, parental rights arguments,and special rights arguments. This analysis gives insight into the ways queerblindness mayappear in policies and activism.Biblical ArgumentsThis first framework uses God and religious concepts to deny the validity and humanityof queer people. This can mean claiming that God made men to love women, or saying thatpeople were assigned their gender by God. There are many different formations of thesearguments, and they rarely, if ever, try to hide their negative views of LGBTQ identities.This framework has been explored by many scholars who have studied the religious right.Tina Fetner looks at how biblical arguments and the religious right have shaped responses fromLGBTQ activists. Fetner shows how the religious right always identifies itself as moral whileidentifying homosexuality as sinful and wrong, justifying these claims with Bible verses andtraditional religious practices. These claims led to a kind of culture war in the 1990s wherepeople either chose to side with the “traditionally moral” religious right or with theinclusivity-focused LGBTQ activists (Fetner, 2002, p. 102). The arguments Fetner identifiesdivide people into the camp of religious and moral or the camp of queer and sinful.13Victoria Clarke is another scholar looking at these biblical arguments with reference togay and lesbian parenting. Clarke describes biblical arguments as anything that cites God or theBible as a reason to oppose homosexuality. Since you cannot empirically disprove God’s plan, itis not easy to argue against biblical arguments (Clarke, 2001). This rhetoric is evident in howgroups like Focus on the Family make statements about “God’s plan” to explain why beingtransgender or queer is unnatural and wrong (Focus on the Family, 2023).These biblical arguments define queerness as wrong (sinful) and unnatural (against God’splan) while placing Christian beliefs as moral and right. Biblical frameworks openly name andcondemn queerness, and therefore cannot be called queerblind. The only comparable racialframework to this one would be those that condemn minority groups and openly uphold whitesupremacy. Even as there are some biblical arguments people use to justify racism, those are notused so frequently as those that deny the humanity of minorities by citing biology or nature.Biologically racist arguments are not widely used in mainstream American society today,showing how these claims are no longer accepted as reasonable arguments. The biblicalarguments, though, are still utilized by religious right groups even if they are not as prevalent asthey were from the 1970s to 2000s.HeteroactivismAnother anti-LGBTQ framework is heteroactivism, which is a term coined by CatherineNash and Kath Brown. Heteroactivist arguments value tradition and family, placing heterosexualrelationships and gender normativity as the cornerstone of civilization and contemporary Westernsociety. Though this argument is rooted in seeing queer identities as immoral and unnatural, itfocuses more of its rhetoric on describing the value of tradition and the fear behind normalizingLGBTQ identities. These arguments are often found in reference to religious tradition, but it does14not necessarily have to connect to the religious right (Nash & Brown, 2020). An example of thiswould be calling homosexuality unnatural or abnormal, praising heteronormative traditions, orclaiming that marriage can only be between a man and a woman.Heteroactivist rhetoric also focuses on inciting fear surrounding LGBTQ identities asthey disrupt the wider heteronormative culture. Leslie Smith describes this as a rhetoricalstrategy she calls chaos rhetoric which uses fear and anxiety to generate sympathy for aparticular cause. Smith shows how chaos rhetoric frames the religious right views surroundingsexuality and gender as mainstream American norms while describing homosexuality as anattack on those norms (Smith, 2014). Inciting fear and upholding tradition make up heteroactivistrhetoric and are usually used to overtly condemn LGBTQ identities. Still, there are ways inwhich this framework can be queerblind by upholding the sanctity of heterosexuality andtradition, without making any clear reference to LGBTQ identities. This can be seen in policiesthat subtly define marriage as between a man and a woman (Rosky, 2017) or just throughidealizing heteronormative traditions.This framework clearly depicts homosexuality and other queer identities as immoral,while depicting heterosexual, cisgender identities as normal and good. Similar to biblicalarguments, there is no way to compare this to colorblind arguments since heteroactivism is sodirect and because it centers around the value of heterosexuality and gender normativity. Arace-conscious argument centered around idealizing the more racist past may be closer, butagain, those types of arguments are less permissible than heteroactivist arguments are today.Sexualization ArgumentsThe sexualization framework, similar to heteroactivist arguments, can be presented inways overtly condemning queerness as well as in ways that are more queerblind. I described15these arguments earlier as it relates to cultural racism arguments which describe black people inparticular as having cultural differences that lead to political and economic differences. For theLGBTQ framework, these arguments do not focus on queer culture broadly, but on how queerpeople are inherently hypersexual. This means describing LGBTQ issues as “sexually explicit”(Stop the Sexualization of Children Act, 2022) or describing particular groups as more sexually“deviant” (Bryant, 1977). Early versions of this rhetoric from the 1970s through the 1990sdescribe homosexuality as predatory, perverted, and unnatural. Many scholars have noted thispredatory rhetoric used to describe gay men and now transwomen (Fejes, 2008; Stone, 2016),showing a shift in who is being sexualized. This sexualization framework is also described byDidi Herman as “old moralist” as it describes queerness with reference to “disease andseduction,” placing homosexuality as an immoral sexual “lifestyle,” rather than an identity(Herman, 1997, p. 18). These ways of describing queer people are not queerblind as they makeobvious homophobic and transphobic claims rooted in sexualizing these identities andconnecting them to disease and exploitation.This framework can also be used in queerblind ways, however, by claiming that LGBTQeducation is not age-appropriate or is potentially harmful to children. Amy Stone describes thesearguments as “child protectionist claims” as people cite protecting children from sexuallyexplicit content as reasons for limiting LGBTQ rights (Stone, 2016). Unlike the queer-consciousforms of sexualization, this version tries not to make explicit reference to queer people andinstead just states that children should not learn about sexually explicit content regarding genderand sexuality – obviously referencing genders and sexualities outside of the heterosexual andcisgender norm.16Whether openly sexualizing these identities or not, this argument is used again and againto discriminate against queer people. As noted earlier, this argument relates to the raciallycolorblind arguments that reference culture or nature and assumes some inherent differences inthe oppressed group. They both use nature, culture, or inherent traits to justify dismissingdiscrimination and limiting equitable solutions.Religious FreedomThe religious freedom framework argues that increasing LGBTQ rights in schools andteaching about queer issues goes against fundamental religious beliefs, thereby denying peopletheir religious freedom. This framework is queerblind, as it avoids condemning LGBTQidentities and instead focuses on freedom of speech and Christian victimization.This kind of framework is used a lot in schools with issues related to school prayer,intelligent design, sex education, and, of course, LGBTQ education. For all these issues, thereligious freedom framework describes how teaching these issues prevents students and teachersfrom practicing their religion. Ian Macgillivray looks at how this framework has been used inschools, showing how teachers and parents argue that inclusivity lessons prevent people fromholding anti-LGBTQ beliefs, which therefore restricts their ability to practice religion(Macgillivray, 2012). By presenting inclusivity and LGBTQ education as an issue of religiousrights, these parents and teachers can get away with making homophobic and transphobicarguments that appear more acceptable.The religious freedom argument also reframes anti-LGBTQ beliefs to be about thepersecution and discrimination of Christians rather than being about the discrimination ofLGBTQ people. Hannah Dick describes this Christian victimization rhetoric by looking atanti-LGBTQ activists response to secularization and reform. She shows how this rhetoric has17been used by groups like the Moral Majority in the 1970s and 1980s up to groups like AllianceDefending Freedom today (Dick, 2021). These arguments have been used as a legal strategy,using the First Amendment to argue over other cases beyond just sexuality but also abortion, sexeducation, school prayer, and rental housing (Brown, 2002). Through narrowly viewing Christianpersecution in these ways, religious freedom is less about practicing religion and more about theperceived threat of increased secularization and acceptance of LGBTQ people.This framework is clearly connected to the biblical framework and may be a moredigestible, queerblind version of it. Many scholars have acknowledged how the biblicalframework is becoming less and less successful due to the increasingly secular public. ClydeWilcox argues that the Christian right has failed to change the overall public opinion on severalissues because of how they associate religion with exclusion and partisanship (Wilcox, 2020).Didi Herman also investigates the theological roots of the Christian right, finding that the largerChristian community may not agree with the specificity of its deeply religious roots. Thisindicates that people use religious freedom arguments, not for theological purposes but more soto justify homophobic and transphobic beliefs (Herman, 1997). Though religious freedom mayappear to be a legitimate legal argument, it stems from these more biblical arguments about thevalidity of LGBTQ identities.By framing these more anti-LBGTQ beliefs as being about Christian persecution andpracticing religion, this framework continues to be used to justify removing LGBTQ inclusivitypractices and education from school curriculums. This framing around the idea of “freedom” iscomparable to Bonilla-Silva’s colorblind framework of abstract liberalism as it uses similarconcepts to justify denying rights to LGBTQ people. This continues to be relevant for other18queerblind frameworks which use ideas like equality, rights, and liberty to argue against LGBTQrights.Parental RightsThe parental rights framework claims that parents should have more of a say in how theirchildren are being raised. For anti-LGBTQ arguments, this means saying that parents should beable to prevent their children from learning about LGBTQ identities. Many policies uphold thesearguments, such as parental opt-out laws, which claim parents have the right to opt their kids outof inclusivity lessons, or the Parental Rights in Education Law (2022), which removes LGBTQissues from the curriculum.This framework is connected to the religious freedom framework as both attempt to keepLGBTQ issues out of schools on the basis that they take away rights from other people. Scholarshave also noted how this framework is used by the Christian right as a sly way to uphold areligious freedom argument under a more widely accepted appearance (Hartman, 2013). DidiHerman (1997) also describes how the religious right has become more focused on theserights-based arguments, whether that be religious rights or parental rights, moving away from“old moralist” arguments and towards “new pragmatist” arguments (p. 18), moving more andmore towards queerblindness. Though parental rights are more secular, there is clearly someconnection to the earlier religious arguments.Even if this argument is fundamentally related to the religious right, there are ways inwhich the parental rights argument is different and worth seeing on its own terms. IanMacgillivray interviewed parents and teachers about the expansion of LGBTQ rights in schoolswho worried that public schools undermine the parents’ ability to instill their beliefs in children(Macgillivray, 2008). Though these parents and teachers may be religious, their arguments are19not explicitly referencing Christian beliefs. These more secular arguments can appeal to peoplewho do not necessarily agree with the religious freedom framework but do believe parents have aright to raise their children as they see fit.This framework is again similar to the colorblind framework of abstract liberalism as ituses liberal ideas like freedom and human rights in order to hide homophobic beliefs. The phrase“parental rights” is agreeable by itself as people accept that families should have a say in howchildren are brought up, even though many would not agree with an anti-LGBTQ stance.Special Rights ArgumentsThe special rights framework has been used as a way of saying that LGBTQ rights are“special rights” that queer people do not deserve. The claim is that these rights go against thevalues of equality and fairness as giving LGBTQ people rights is a kind of special treatment.This framework has been used for a long time as a way to go against LGBTQ activism andanti-discrimination laws, stating that they are part of a “special rights agenda” (Reed, 1996).This framework is used to make voters and the public question the demands made byLGBTQ activists and whether these demands are fair. Much of the early anti-LGBTQ rhetoricdescribed LGBTQ identities as a “lifestyle,” separating LGBTQ identities from immutablecharacteristics like race. This framing of LGBTQ rights as special and chosen makes peoplemore likely to question the validity of LGBTQ rights (Haider-Markel & Joslyn, 2013). Earlierrhetoric also often describes gay men and women as superior economically, stating that rightsshould not be rewarded to people who are already better off (Gluckman & Reed, 1997). Specialrights were especially used in the 1990s to express why LGBTQ rights are invalid and unfair,again bringing in these concepts of fairness and equality to argue against LGBTQ rights.20Though the phrase “special rights” is no longer used in contemporary anti-LGBTQarguments, there are still ways in which this framework continues. In school settings, somepeople describe LGBTQ rights as unfair, echoing the idea that LGBTQ rights are special rights.Macgillivray looks at responses to the LGBTQ reforms with some teachers and parentsreferencing religious or parental rights, while others state that talking about LGBTQ issues inschools would serve more to disunify people and draw out differences. They claim that thiswould foster inequality and unnecessarily reward certain identities and beliefs (Macgillivray,2008). There are also scholars looking at arguments from teachers that state that the “specialtreatment” (p. 41) LGBTQ people are given goes against ideals of equality as it asks teachers andparents to put aside their own rights and beliefs in favor of the beliefs of a small minority(Kazyak, Burke, & Stange, 2018). By making LGBTQ rights in schools out to be unfair andunreasonable, the people making these arguments do not appear to be as anti-LGBTQ as theyare.Though describing LGBTQ rights as “special rights” may not always appear queerblind,there are many ways in which minimizing the need for LGBTQ rights and referring to LGBTQrights as unfair can appear appealing and reasonable. This framework relates to colorblindnessboth in Bodilla-Silva’s minimization framework and his abstract liberalism framework. Specialrights similarly minimize the need for LGBTQ rights and the extent to which LGBTQ people areoppressed. Special rights also used liberal concepts like equality and fairness to justifydiscrimination against LGBTQ people. Though the racially colorblind arguments have morespecific goals, they both similarly minimize racism and homophobia or transphobia to show whypassing anti-discrimination laws is unnecessary.Anti-LGBTQ Frameworks21These anti-LGBTQ frameworks are all still used today to different degrees. Though theyhave become less common, some still use queer-conscious arguments that explicitly refer toLGBTQ identities as anti-God or unnatural. Still, there are far more queerblind arguments thathave come up through this research as I show in the policy and activism chapters. Thesequeerblind frameworks all attempt to reframe these homophobic and transphobic arguments sothat they appear to be about protecting the rights of others, whether that be parents, Christians, orchildren. They also minimize the importance of LGBTQ rights by calling them “special” andunfair. These frameworks are not easy to argue against but certainly have had an impact on howpeople view LGBTQ rights, especially LGBTQ rights in schools.Emerging Colorblind and Queerblind FrameworksThis section will briefly analyze some emerging frameworks that I have seen inarguments about teaching race and LGBTQ issues in schools. There is not a lot of literatureabout either of the two frameworks I have identified, but they are worth looking into due to theircolorblind and queerblind rhetoric and their relevance to anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws. Theseframeworks center around how teaching about race and LGBTQ issues is too uncomfortable,complicated, and controversial to be talked about in schools. These arguments can be found inthe policies and activism related to race and LGBTQ issues as both frameworks can becolorblind and queerblind.ComfortabilityThe comfortability framework is more related to racial colorblindness as it is used toavoid topics related to race as it makes white people uncomfortable. This framework argues thatviewing everyone as equal and avoiding white resentment is more important than dealing withracial discrimination and our racist history. This comfortability framework can also apply to22LGBTQ issues as people claim that LGBTQ education is irrelevant to schooling and can fosterinequality. The comfortability here has less to do with heterosexual kids, but with the parents andteachers who do not feel comfortable with kids learning about LGBTQ issues.Some scholars have shown how the comfortability framework is used by teachers andparents to avoid teaching race-related issues in schools. Marianne Modica reports how the fear ofbeing called racist or the discomfort in talking about race has led to a colorblind approach inmany schools. Modica shows how this kind of education leads to disparate outcomes for studentsof color and other significant limitations in recognizing and preventing bias (Modica, 2015).Still, many people advocate against multicultural education due to cases of white resentment anddiscomfort (Apfelbaum, Norton, & Sommers, 2012). By framing race education as irrelevant toschooling and uncomfortable for white students and teachers, people can hold colorblind viewsthat lead to racially discriminatory outcomes. Similarly, by looking at LGBTQ education asirrelevant and uncomfortable to talk about, opponents can hold discriminatory views withoutbeing held accountable.Political ArgumentsThe political arguments are those that claim that race or LGBTQ issues are too divisiveand political to be talked about in school. This comes up a lot when people use words like“indoctrination” to describe education surrounding race, gender, or sexuality in schools, makingit appear too political and inappropriate for children. This is clear when looking at the discoursesurrounding Critical Race Theory and how critics describe it as teaching white kids that they areoppressors and teaching kids of color that they are oppressed (Morgan, 2022). Describingeducation surrounding race in this highly politicized way makes parents understandablyuncomfortable. This same kind of framework is used in the discourse surrounding LGBTQ issues23in schools, presenting it as radical and highly political. These political arguments can becolorblind and queerblind in how people can be against politics in the classroom while nothaving to admit to being anti-black or anti-LGBTQ.Colorblindness and Queerblindness ComparedIt is clear that colorblind literature can give some insight into how to view anti-LGBTQarguments. Colorblind arguments use various rhetorical methods to deny systemic racism withinAmerican society. These methods include upholding vague liberal concepts, referencing thecultural and natural tendencies of racial groups, and minimizing racism as a problem. The waysthat colorblind racism is manifested in American society have been thoroughly investigated inscholarly works, though this same treatment has not been done with the comparable queerblindframeworks. Queerblind frameworks similarly work to avoid making value statements aboutLGBTQ and reframe their arguments to be about how LGBTQ rights take away the liberal valuesof freedom, equality, and fairness. Both colorblind and queerblind rhetoric minimize the impactand importance of racism, homophobia, and transphobia today. Instead, they reframe who thevictims are in contemporary society, with colorblind arguments claiming that white people arethe victims of affirmative action and queerblind frameworks claiming that Christians are thevictims of LGBTQ rights. It is clear that anti-black arguments today are less common as they areless widely permissible, but anti-LGBTQ arguments are still prevalent today, especially inreligious right activism. Even so, today’s rhetoric has shifted to be much more queerblind,utilizing those particular frameworks that I have outlined. The next two sections will look at howthese different frameworks appear in anti-LGBTQ policies and activism, examining howqueerblind rhetoric has grown over time.24III. Anti-LGBTQ Curriculum LawsThis chapter examines two periods of anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws: laws spanning from1987 to 2001 and the more recent bills and laws of 2022. The 1987 to 2001 period encapsulatesthis first wave of anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws, with the first law passing in 1987 and the lastone in 2001. In 2022, new anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws were introduced and passed,establishing a new period of anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws. This chapter evaluates and identifiesthe various anti-LGBTQ arguments being made in these two time periods, showing howqueerblind arguments have changed and increased over the years.My focus on anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws is due to their recent popularity andsignificance within the culture. Opponents of LGBTQ rights clearly target schools and schoolcurriculums to push their agendas, leading to this wave of laws in 2022. Anti-LGBTQcurriculum laws also tend towards queerblind rhetoric, unlike other modern laws that are moredirectly discriminatory. I chose the label “anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws” as a broad term toencapsulate any laws impacting LGBTQ students in the classroom. Other scholars have morenarrowly called these “no promo homo” to describe any laws that discourage homosexuality inan indirect way (Eskridge, 2000). Today, curriculum laws are most famously referred to as“Don’t Say Gay” laws, as many laws prevent educators from talking about LGBTQ issues withtheir students (Movement Advancement Project, 2022). Though these categories have beenpopularly used within the literature, they do not encompass all the laws that may impact LGBTQschool curricula. I adopt a phrase similar to Clifford Rosky’s “anti-gay curriculum laws,” butsince many laws from 2022 discriminate against transgender and gender non-binary people aswell as gay, “anti-gay curriculum” is no longer completely applicable (2017). By using the termanti-LGBTQ curriculum laws, I refer to any laws that impact LGBTQ students through their25school’s curriculum, whether that be banning certain topics or requiring that teachers condemnLGBTQ identities. I further categorize these laws into the anti-LGBTQ frameworks that Idiscussed in the previous chapter in order to understand the arguments being used and wherequeerblindness may fit in.The first section goes over the laws spanning from 1987 to 2001, focusing on the lawsthat are still technically on the books and the laws that illustrate a particular anti-LGBTQframework. The next section looks at the more recent laws and bills from 2022, including anylaw that has recently been passed, and any bills that gained a lot of attention. I show how lawsare becoming more queerblind, using sexualization and heteroactivist frameworks at first andlater focusing more on parental rights and political arguments.Anti-LGBTQ Curriculum Laws: 1987-2001Anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws made the news in 2022 when Florida passed their law, butthey have been around since 1987 when Oklahoma and Louisiana passed their curriculum laws(Oklahoma School Code, 1987; Education Code, 1987). States continued to write and passanti-LGBTQ curriculum laws throughout the 1990s until 2001 when Utah passed the last one till2022 (State System of Public Education, 2001). These older laws have some stark differencesfrom what is seen in today's language, with more direct, homophobic rhetoric as well as differentlegal strategies behind the laws.First, I show how the sexualization argument is used through their references to sodomylaws. Then, I evaluate how the AIDS epidemic was referenced in these curriculum laws, againusing sexualization arguments and heteroactivism. Then, I examine the queerblind heteroactivistlaws that indirectly reference homosexuality. The sexualization and heteroactivist frameworks,26though at times queerblind, indicate a view of LGBTQ people that is more disparaging anddismissive than what we see in today’s language.Sodomy LawsThe state sodomy laws of the 1980s and 1990s criminalize homosexuality and were usedas a basis in these curriculum laws to show homosexuality as unacceptable, immoral, and, ofcourse, criminal. These laws inherently sexualize queer people by assuming homosexuality (andsurely other queer identities) to be more sexually explicit and promiscuous than heterosexualidentities. They also tend to uphold a heteroactivist argument by referring to homosexuality asunnatural and abnormal.This trend of referencing sodomy laws began in Texas in 1991 with their statute requiringthat educational programs for students 18 years and younger state that “homosexual conduct isnot an acceptable lifestyle and is a criminal offense under Section 21.06, Penal Code” (Healthand Safety Code, 1991). Another section over instructional education requires that sex educationinclude “emphasis, provided in a factual manner and from a public health perspective, thathomosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and that homosexual conduct is acriminal offense under Section 21.06, Penal Code” (Health and Safety Code, 1991). Alabamauses nearly the same language in their law requiring that public schools state “that homosexualconduct is a criminal offense under the laws of the state” (Code of Alabama, 1992). The“criminal offense” mentioned in these laws is the sodomy law. Through this reference to the law,they make it clear that homosexuality is wrong without necessarily having to state it outright.Just by referencing sodomy, it is clear that homosexuality is an immoral sexual act that must becondemned in schools. The laws also use some heteroactivist language through phrases like“factual manner” and “public health perspective,” appearing more objective in their claims about27homosexuality as wrong and unnatural. These laws go beyond just banning LGBTQ discussionsin schools but require the condemnation and discrimination of homosexuality. Sexualization andheteroactivism are used here in an effort to show how wrong and immoral homosexuality is,making it necessary that people advocate against it in schools.Other laws that reference sodomy are less direct in their conclusions abouthomosexuality. Mississippi’s 1998 law states that sex education must include “the current statelaw related to sexual conduct, including forcible rape, statutory rape, paternity establishment,child support and homosexual activity” (Mississippi Code, 1998). With the “current state law”being a sodomy law, Mississippi is more subtle in its reference to homosexuality as illegal. Still,the inclusion of homosexuality in a list that starts with “forcible rape,” attaches an undeniablestigma to homosexuality and equates it to immoral sexual acts like rape or pedophilia (Hoshall,2013). Mississippi’s sodomy law itself also conflates homosexuality with beastiality callinghomosexuality a “detestable and abominable crime against nature committed with mankind orwith beast” (Mississippi Code, 2013). Rather than overtly calling homosexuality unacceptablelike Texas and Alabama, Mississippi requires only that the current law is taught; but through therhetoric within the law, it is clear that homosexuality is treated as something hypersexual andimmoral. Even if there is no direct reference to homosexuality, there is a clear hypersexualizationattached to homosexual identities.Laws that do not reference sodomy, like Louisiana’s in 1987, can still be based onsexualizing homosexual identities. Louisiana’s law states, “No sex education course offered inthe public schools of the state shall utilize any sexually explicit materials depicting male orfemale homosexual activity” (Education Code, 1987). The logic behind this ban seems to berooted in pairing homosexuality with “sexually explicit materials” and making homosexuality28out to be more explicit and shameful than heterosexual relationships. Though sodomy is not apart of this law, the sexualization argument is as it continues to hypersexualize homosexuality inorder to ban its inclusion and acceptance in schools.Underlying these laws, whether or not they reference sodomy, there is a heteroactivistassumption that homosexuality is wrong and heterosexuality is right. At the same time, they usepeople’s sexualized assumptions about queer people as a basis for discrimination. Using sodomylaws gives not only a legal basis behind curriculum laws, they also perpetuate these sexualizedassumptions and promote heteroactivism.How the AIDS Epidemic Impacted School Curriculum LawsThis earlier period of curriculum laws also coincided with the AIDS epidemic and themisinformation surrounding AIDS and homosexuality. Many school curriculum laws referencehomosexuality within this context, referencing AIDS as the only avenue in which homosexualitycan be taught or as reasoning for why homosexuality should be avoided.Many laws reference homosexuality solely within this context. Oklahoma’s law requiresthat AIDS prevention education include “engaging in homosexual activity” as a cause for AIDS,and claims that avoiding said homosexual “activities” is a means of preventing the spread of thevirus (Oklahoma School Code, 1987). North Carolina’s law from 1995, which has since beenrepealed, also includes “homosexual acts” as a “significant means of transmission” for AIDS(Elementary and Secondary Education, 1995). South Carolina’s law similarly states that thereshould be no discussion of “alternative lifestyles from heterosexual relationships including, butnot limited to, homosexual relationships except in the context of instruction concerning sexuallytransmitted diseases” (Comprehensive Health Education Act, 1988). This explicitly states thatthe only way to talk about homosexuality, and other queer identities, is through the lens of29transmissible disease. By only allowing references to homosexuality in this context, there is anautomatic association between homosexuality and disease. This kind of rhetoric clearly placeshomosexuality as a cause of the AIDS crisis and further refers to homosexuality as a choice thatcan be avoided. The only acceptable way to talk about homosexuality in schools is as somethingharmful and unnatural, using the AIDS crisis as an empirical reason for why homosexuality iswrong. All these laws referencing AIDS utilize sexualization and heteroactivist frameworks bypresenting homosexuality as a kind of promiscuous lifestyle and by only depicting and defininghomosexuality as connected to diseaseQueerblind Heteroactivist LawsThe last kind of law I include from this time period is less focused on outrightdiscouraging homosexuality as it is in encouraging heterosexuality and heterosexual marriage.These laws are still heteroactivist as they promote traditional and heteronormative expectations,but can be queerblind by avoiding any direct references to homosexuality.These laws tend to encourage heterosexuality while slyly pointing out the problems ofhomosexuality. North Carolina’s law depicts the goodness of heterosexuality and the problemswith homosexually, stating that “a mutually faithful monogamous heterosexual relationship inthe context of marriage is the best lifelong means of avoiding diseases transmitted by sexualcontact, including Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)” (Elementary and SecondaryEducation, 1995). This clearly uses heteroactivist logic, as it promotes heterosexuality andtraditional marriage. South Carolina’s law also prohibits discussing “alternative lifestyles”outside of heterosexual relationships, promoting heterosexuality through silencing references tohomosexuality (Comprehensive Health Education Act, 1988). By only overtly promotingheterosexuality, these laws are often exempt from being called homophobic.30Many sex education laws also promote queerblind heteroactivism through theirpromotion of abstinence until marriage in which marriage is defined as being between a man anda woman. Rosky refers to these laws as the “largest and the most frequently overlooked” of allanti-LGBTQ curriculum laws (2017). Though they make no mention of queer identities, theystill promote this logic of heterosexual superiority and implied homosexual inferiority. By onlyreferencing the benefits of heterosexuality and traditional marriage, these laws appearunproblematic and nondiscriminatory even as they still reflect anti-LGBTQ attitudes. Even asthese laws do not require that school curriculums condemn homosexual “lifestyles,” they stillperpetuate a heteronormative standard that indirectly calls homosexuality unacceptable.ImplicationsAll these laws mentioned, aside from North Carolina’s, are in some way still on thebooks, though there is not a huge likelihood that jurisdictions will enforce curriculum laws thatcontradict the legal authority of the Lawrence (2003), Windsor (2013), and Obergefell (2015)cases. Still, as of 2017, Clifford Rosky found that some jurisdictions are still enforcing some ofthese policies. But regardless of the level of enforcement, these laws give insight into thearguments made at the time and the level at which homophobia was deemed acceptable insociety.It is clear how some laws directly confront homosexuality like Texas and Alabamacalling homosexuality unacceptable and criminal, or Oklahoma and North Carolina’s associatinghomosexuality with disease. The heteroactivist and abstinence-till-marriage laws more indirectlyforbid homosexual curriculum by favoring heterosexual monogamy. Some laws also avoidoutrightly condemning homosexuality, just referring to it as an “alternative lifestyle” (1988).31This indicates that even during this time, there was some hesitation toward overt homophobia insome states.Still, the heteroactivist and sexualization arguments of these laws reflect the attitude ofthe time that looked down upon gay people as choosing sinful lives that are unnatural andimmoral. They teach children that homosexual identities are illegitimate and that the only way toavoid disease is through heterosexual marriage. Though some laws only focus on the benefits ofheterosexual monogamy, the prevailing attitude of these laws is to denounce and delegitimizehomosexuality. And despite not referencing queer identities beyond homosexual ones, these lawscertainly invalidate any identities that go against the heteronormative expectation. This earliertime period worried less about appealing to a tolerant public or strategically passing laws. Thenext section shows how queerblindness became a more fundamental part of policy language in2022.Anti-LGBTQ Curriculum Policies in 2022Since the 2001 Utah law banned “advocacy of homosexuality” in schools, there havebeen no new anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws until 2022 in Florida. Florida’s Parental Rights inEducation Act, colloquially known as Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” law, seemed to begin a newpolicy trend towards anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws. During this gap, there were certainly somelaws like parental opt-out laws which allow parents to opt out of lessons that cover LGBTQmaterial, but there were no laws specifically prohibiting LGBTQ lessons or discussions. SinceFlorida wrote out its bill, a number of other states have proposed bills and amendments of theirown.These new policies are different from those of the 1990s as they do not just focus onsexuality curriculum, but they also ban discussions of gender identity. The argumentative32frameworks are also different from the earlier era. The parental rights framework began as abasis for these anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws. Sexualization arguments continued to be a part ofthese laws, only with more queerblind language. Political arguments have also been fundamentalin justifying anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws. I argue that these newer policies all exhibit somekind of queerblind rhetoric in order to appear less discriminatory, homophobic, and transphobic.The Emergence of Parental RightsThe first anti-LGBTQ curriculum law to get passed in 2022 was Florida’s Parental Rightsin Education law. This law is seven pages long and requires that school districts notify andadhere to the parent’s right to raise their children how they see fit. The law itself is mostly madeup of when school districts must notify parents, such as any change to the student’s health careservices, any change to other student services, and any change that may impact a student’smental and emotional well-being. The brief reference to gender and sexuality in the law states,“Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or genderidentity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriateor developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards” (Parental Rightsin Education 2022). Though most of the law is overwhelmingly focused on parental rights, thelaw itself is anti-LGBTQ, censoring any classroom discussion related to LGBTQ identities.The logic of the argument draws itself away from making any moral claims aboutLGBTQ identities and instead rests on the idea that parents have a fundamental right to makedecisions about the upbringing of their children. This line of argument is far more queerblindthan the earlier laws as it attempts to hide any clear homophobic or heteronormative statements.Though still mentioning LGBTQ identities, the argument takes queer issues out of theconversation and reframes it as an issue of parental rights and child welfare. By only mentioning33sexuality and gender briefly in the seven-page document, they are able to hide their anti-LGBTQintention through the much larger focus on parental rights.This reframing of LGBTQ issues to be about parents and child welfare has continuedbeyond this one law, making its way into numerous bills and activist rhetoric. The emergence ofthis framework in the past few years shows a renewed effort towards queerblindness andqueerblind frameworks that completely hide their anti-LGBTQ intention.Queerblind Changes to the Sexualization FrameworkSince Florida passed their law, other states have written out anti-LGBTQ curriculum billsand Alabama passed theirs. Many of these bills resemble earlier anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws asthey are quietly included within larger school policy expectations. These newer laws also tend touse the sexualization framework, referring to queer identities as hypersexual in order to forbidtheir inclusion in school curriculums. Though this has been consistent throughout both periods ofanti-LGBTQ curriculum laws, they have become much more subtle and queerblind now thanthey were in the past.The modern sexualization bills seek to ban sexual materials, clearly meaning that they arebanning LGBTQ materials. On the national level, a bill called “Stop the Sexualization ofChildren Act” has been introduced by Mike Johnson in October 2022. This bill attempts toprohibit any federal funds from going towards any “sexually oriented program, event, orliterature” for children 10 and younger. The bill describes “sexually oriented” as “any depiction,description, or simulation of sexual activity, any lewd or lascivious depiction or description ofhuman genitals, or any topic involving gender identity, gender dysphoria, transgenderism, sexualorientation, or related subjects.” This bill goes beyond schools by including libraries and anyagencies that use federal grants. This also includes the potential firing of transgender teachers,34since any exposure to “transgenderism” counts as sexually-oriented. They also use a parentalrights kind of argument when the bill states “parents and legal guardians have the right andresponsibility to determine where, if, when, and how their children are exposed to material of asexual nature” claiming that it is the parent’s right to teach children about these issues, not thegovernment or public institutions. Even with this mention of parental rights, though, there is adependence on the inherent “sexual nature” of queer identities, making it clear that it is becausequeer people are inherently more sexual that the material is too sensitive for public schooling. Bysubtly referring to queer issues as unsuitable and perverted, this bill could be used to discriminateand invalidate many groups of LGBTQ people (2022).The ways this law sexualizes queer identities are also somewhat reminiscent of earlier,less queerblind laws. The definition of “sexually oriented” used in the bill lists LGBTQ issuesalongside depictions of human genitals and sexual activity – conflating queer identities withthese obviously explicit materials. This is similar to Mississippi’s 1998 law which listshomosexuality alongside forcible rape. Though this earlier law has more predatory implications,they both attempt to sexualize LGBTQ identities in order to make them appear unacceptable andperverted.Still, this act does not make any overt reference to queer identities as being wrong orimmoral, merely stating that LGBTQ issues are not appropriate for children to learn about. Thisshows how sexualization arguments have become more queerblind. People may say that theyaccept LGBTQ identities, but still associate queerness with sexual promiscuity and predatorybehavior, thus making it necessary to shield that material from children. Because it is not directlycalling queer people unacceptable or immoral, people can agree with this bill without feeling likethey are actually advocating for homophobia or transphobia. It is framed as a way to protect35children from inappropriate content, which is widely agreeable. Though this bill is unlikely topass, it still shows how these sexualization arguments have remained a logical basis for theselaws, even if these newer arguments no longer rely on the AIDS epidemic or sodomy laws. Italso shows the way that these laws not only impinge on the rights of queer people but perpetuateharmful stereotypes to make their point.The sexualization argument has also been used by other states, such as Florida andAlabama. Florida’s law focuses on what is “age-appropriate” and what is “developmentallyappropriate” for children as a reason to exclude instruction and discussion about queer identities.The focus on “student welfare” in the law also implies that the purpose of the law is not topromote homophobic beliefs but to protect children (Parental Rights in Education Act 2022).Alabama’s new law also does this as it includes sexual orientation and gender identity as not“age appropriate” for K-5 education (2022). Though not as obvious as the national bill, this kindof language implies that issues of gender and sexuality are too sexually explicit for children,even when learning about heterosexual and cisgender identities is perfectly okay.Though some of these laws are very subtle in their sexualization of queer identities, theyall use the unconscious assumption many people unfortunately hold that queer people areinherently more hypersexual in order to justify removing LGBTQ issues from schoolcurriculums. Rather than directly referencing LGBTQ identities as more hypersexual, theyindirectly refer to gender and sexuality as sexually explicit material, thereby being exempt fromobvious discrimination and bigotry.Political ArgumentsThe last contemporary argument that has come up in these anti-LGBTQ curriculum billsis the political framework. This framework justifies censoring LGBTQ education by referring to36it as too divisive and controversial. Some of this “age-appropriate” type of language I referencedbefore may be implying that teaching about gender and sexuality is too politically divisive forchildren. Some bills more directly address this idea of politics in the classroom with Ohio andMissouri’s bills claiming that issues of race and sexuality in schools are too divisive andunsuitable for children (Prohibits Discrimination in Education, 2022; Regards promotion,teaching-divisive, inherently racist concepts, 2022). Louisiana’s bill also uses morematter-of-fact language which doesn’t have a clear basis for the prohibition, simply stating, “Noteacher, school employee, or other presenter shall cover the topics of sexual orientation or genderidentity in any classroom discussion or instruction in kindergarten through grade eight” (H.B.837, 2022). The ambiguity in some of these laws may be referring to LGBTQ identities as toosexually explicit, or they may be making an argument about their political divisiveness. Thesereferences to political divisiveness are newer in this rhetoric but similarly pose themselves as notbeing anti-LGBTQ but just worried about student welfare.Increased Queerblindness in 2022The bills and laws of 2022 all utilize queerblind frameworks in some way. Theemergence of the parental rights framework was significant as it completely shifted the narrativeaway from LGBTQ rights and towards parental rights, reframing who is the victim and what isthe problem. Sexualization arguments were also primarily queerblind by calling gender andsexuality sexually explicit rather than referring to specific identities as more hypersexual thanothers. The political arguments also refrain from naming specific identities and only refer to thetopic of gender and sexuality as being too politically divisive. The use of these frameworks todayclearly refrains from queer-conscious language, trying to cover any anti-LGBTQ language asbeing about something other than discrimination against queer people.37Queerblind Changes Over TimeThe difference in the language and scope of these laws compared to the earlier ones issignificant. This can be seen in how Alabama repealed its 1992 law which explicitly claims thatqueer identities are unacceptable, only to pass a new law in 2022 that bans schools from teachingabout gender and sexuality because it is not “age-appropriate” (2022). The first law bases itslogic on the assumption that queer people are inferior, while the newer law bases its logic on theassumption that learning about queer issues is inappropriate for children. Both of these laws arerooted in homophobic beliefs, but one states it much more clearly than the other. The languageand arguments here have shifted to be more queerblind, as explicitly stating that homosexualityis wrong is no longer going to find widespread acceptance or get through the political process. Itis more beneficial today to argue that these topics are inappropriate, rather than arguing thatbeing gay is immoral or wrong.The laws from the 1990s also claim that queerness is a choice through the consistent useof the word “lifestyle,” implying that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice and a sinful one at that(Hoshall, 2013). The language in the newer laws does not make any clear or overt claims thatrefer to homosexuality as a choice, reflecting a change in how LGBTQ identities are understoodand talked about today. The newer laws also do not use words like “homosexuality” and insteadban discussion of “sexual orientation” and “gender identity,” recognizing that there are identitiesbeyond just heterosexuality and homosexuality. It is clear, though, that these laws are notbanning sexual orientation as it relates to heterosexuality, or gender identity as it relates totraditional gender norms; instead, they are banning teaching about sexuality and gender as itrelates to LGBTQ identities. By only broadly saying sexuality and gender, they avoid having to38mention the true intent and impact of these laws which is to prevent LGBTQ acceptance and topromote heteronormativity.The use of sexualization arguments has remained consistent since the forming ofanti-LGBTQ curriculum laws. These laws draw their logic from the assumption that queerness isinherently more sexual and shameful than heterosexuality. The earlier laws do this through theirreferences to sodomy laws and through calling homosexuality explicit. These contemporary lawsuse terms like “age-appropriate” and “sexually oriented” to fuel the assumptions and stigmas thatsexualize queer people. Even as they both use the same arguments, it is clear how today’s policylanguage much more subtly draws these connections and makes their arguments.These older laws, for the most part, are making overt claims about the value and moralityof queer people through their references to sodomy laws, the AIDS epidemic, and through theoften disparaging language. There are some exceptions to this though. The split between directand indirect laws that Eskridge examined indicates that there has been some form ofqueerblindness even during the 1990s (Eskridge, 2000). This was helped by the marriage laws ofthe time which allowed policies to subtly enforce heterosexuality without having to mentionsexuality at all. Some laws also even look like they could have been written today, likeLouisiana’s 1987 law which doesn’t claim that homosexuality is wrong or sinful, just that therecan be no “sexually explicit materials depicting male or female homosexual activity” (EducationCode, 1987). This clearly links homosexuality with explicit materials, but it does so in a waysimilar to today which avoids directly calling homosexuality sexual or predatory and merelyimplies it.Despite the consistent queerblindness over time, it was not until 2022 that queerblindrhetoric became a fundamental part of these policies. Laws today use queerblind frameworks like39parental rights arguments and political arguments in order to justify their position. They alsoreframe the purpose of the law, not to be about limiting LGBTQ acceptance and exposure, butabout the safety of children, the rights of parents, or the rights of teachers.It is also important to take note of the bills that are not so queerblind. The national billrepresents how people are still comfortable talking about LGBTQ people as hypersexual andpredatory. Though not so explicit as earlier laws that call homosexuality criminal throughreference to sodomy, they still make it clear that queer issues, and especially trans issues, aresomehow more sexually explicit than heterosexuality and cisgender identities. The public is stillcomfortable with certain levels of homophobia and transphobia, whether that be throughsexualization, political divisiveness, or prioritizing “rights” over LBGTQ acceptance.40IV. How Anti-LGBTQ Activism Has Become More QueerblindThe anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws would not have been so successful if it were not forthe many anti-LGBTQ activist groups behind the scenes. This chapter examines the frameworksand arguments anti-LGBTQ activist groups have used, beginning with the earlier activism in the1970s to the early 2000s up to the more recent anti-LGBTQ activism focusing on schools andLGBTQ youth. By analyzing anti-LGBTQ activism, I am able to identify the different types ofanti-LGBTQ frameworks that are not found in policies, including the special rights frameworkand religious frameworks. As stated earlier, most of the literature on anti-LGBTQ or anti-gayactivism has mostly centered around the Christian right. This chapter examines the Christianright’s influence over time as well as how recent activism has begun shifting away from religion.Through looking at earlier activism from the 1970s to the early 2000s, I examine howqueerblindness was used at the time, and how today’s activism has shifted more towardsqueerblindness. Early activism focused more on the biblical, sexualization, heteroactivism, andspecial rights frameworks, while later activism is more focused on religious freedom, parentalrights, and political arguments. Sexualization frameworks are again prevalent throughout bothperiods, however later rhetoric is more subtle.Anti-LGBTQ Activism from the 1970s to the Early 2000sTo start off, I examine how the religious right has formed its arguments in the past, goingfrom the 1970s with Antia Bryant’s activism till the early 2000s with groups like Focus on theFamily. Within this span of time, the Christian right changed its arguments significantly, startingoff with only using direct and openly homophobic arguments, eventually moving towards morepolitical and strategic arguments in the 1990s and early 2000s. This section shows how even with41earlier activism, there was an intentional shift away from biblical, queer-conscious arguments,and towards more secular queerblind arguments.The 1970s and 1980s: Antia Bryant and the Moral MajorityOne figure famous for their opposition to the gay liberation movement is Anita Bryantand her “Save Our Children” campaign. Anita Bryant was a singer and pageant star from the1950s into the 1970s when she became an outspoken anti-gay activist. She began this activismwhen Florida passed an ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1977.Bryant worked to repeal this ordinance with her “Save Our Children” campaign and was able tosuccessfully repeal it later that year. Bryant’s success here was due to her mobilization of theChristian right through the use of biblical arguments and the sexualization of homosexuality.Bryant continuously emphasizes her devotion to the Bible and how not only ishomosexuality against Christianity, but homosexuals themselves. She states in a fundraisingletter that she cannot stand by when “the homosexuals burn the Holy Bible in public.” Ratherthan quoting Bible verses, she more often just refers to homosexuality as a “sin” and claims thatthe nation as a whole is losing sight of “God’s moral law.” She claims that laws protectinghomosexuality lead the nation astray, and that though homosexual acts are, “no longer criminal,they are still sin.” Beyond just making these religious claims, she makes claims about gay peoplegenerally, repeatedly calling homosexuals “militant” in her book, clearly making gay people outto be sinful and even sadistic, trying to spread their “evil influence” onto children (Bryant, 1977).By framing her claims as morally justified by God and framing homosexuality as anti-God andsinful, she successfully appealed to the Christian right’s base.Anita Bryant also used sexualization arguments in her activism, having a particular focuson the dangers of homosexual teachers and homosexual influences on children. She claims in her42book that by making homosexuality more accepted by the general public, more kids will seehomosexuality as “an acceptable life-style” (p. 155). She also claims that a “deviant-mindedteacher could sexually molest children” (p. 155), clearly regarding homosexuality as pedophilic.This kind of argument is not unfamiliar, though it is jarring how explicitly Bryant refers tohomosexuality as predatory and sadistic. Bryant often attempts to claim that she does not hatehomosexuals or that she would not generalize about all homosexuals, but she makes a caveat onhow this is about protecting children. By framing her argument in this way, she is able to appealto parents and build fear surrounding gay people.Another group from this time was the Moral Majority, which was a national organizationfounded by Baptist minister Jerry Falwell in 1979. Falwell worked alongside Anita Bryant inmany instances and used similar arguments and frameworks as she did. Falwell describes in anewsletter how he was fighting against “the militant homosexuals who were trying to force theirdegrading lifestyle on innocent children there” (1979). This, again, describes gay people asupholding a predatory and sinful “lifestyle,” framing homosexuality as undermining the moralvalues of America. This statement also utilizes the sexualization argument, by framing theargument as being about protecting children from the dangerous homosexuals. This anti-gaysentiment goes even further to describe AIDS as “God’s punishment for homosexuality”(Wilcox, 2021). The Moral Majority continued Bryant’s fear-mongering rhetoric about thedangers and sinfulness of homosexuality, not posing any effort to appear queerblind.Though Bryant and the Moral Majority primarily worked against anti-discriminationlaws, they were also fearful of gay teachers and the potential politicizing of schools. This showshow schools have always been an important battleground for the anti-LGBTQ movement and theculture war. Falwell expresses his distaste for modern education stating, “the schools are steeped43in humanistic philosophy guided by atheistic and vulgar textbooks, rotten with drugs, sexualpermissiveness and lack of discipline” (1979). Bryant, too, expressed her worries over gayteachers and spreading their “evil influence” (1977). Earlier activism still viewed schools asspreading harmful and overly political influences onto children.These arguments first and foremost use Biblical frameworks to emphasize the sin ofhomosexuality and the morality of their Christian opposition. They also utilize sexualizationarguments, showing the dangers of gay educators and using language that makes them appear tobe grooming children into becoming homosexuals as well. They also use heteroactivism to showhow the nation as a whole is in danger of becoming sinful through not continuing to upholdheteronormative values. These arguments do not go into the rights-based arguments that we seemore today, and focus more on God and fear-mongering tactics. Bryant’s activism tapered off inthe 1980s after getting a divorce took away some of her religious authority, and the MoralMajority also dissolved before the 1990s. Despite that, they still had a fundamental part inmobilizing the religious right and creating a basis for how to argue against LGBTQ rights(Fetner, 2008). In the 1990s, changes were made in order to appeal to more people rather thanthe narrow, but influential, base that Bryant and the Moral Majority built.Changes in the 1990s and early 2000sThe 1990s experienced a big shift in the logical framework behind these anti-gay activistgroups. Although groups like the Christian Coalition and Focus on the Family continued to usebiblical arguments, heteroactivism, and sexualization, there were also new frameworks andstrategies at the time. Amy Gluckman and Betsy Reed identify three ways in which the rhetoricof the 1990s changes. For one, the 1990s refocus on family rights rather than just focusing onreligion. Then, they describe the special rights argument, which claims that anti-discrimination44laws are really just “special rights” for gay people, implying that homosexuality is not animmutable characteristic like race is which does need anti-discrimination laws. They finallyshow how anti-gay groups make economic arguments, stating that homosexuals, especially gaymen, are wealthier and more highly educated, further showing why they do not deserve “special”rights or protections (Gluckman and Reed, 1997). This section examines how activist groupschanged their language to be more family-oriented and more focused on “special rights,” shiftingaway from the more explicitly religious rhetoric of the past.Groups like the Christian Coalition of the 1990s certainly used these new frameworks,leading to more widespread support with one-sixth of America aligning themselves with theChristian Coalition (Wilcox, Debell, and Sigelman, 1999). One of the founders of the ChristianCoalition, Ralph Reed, describes this change in rhetoric in his book Active Faith : HowChristians Are Changing the Soul of American Politics saying that the rhetoric of the 1980s istoo quick to call opponents “anti-family” or “anti-God” (p. 120). This kind of harsh rhetoricscares away wider audiences. He also denounces how other groups have referred tohomosexuals:I have found some of the religious conservative movement’s discourse onhomosexuality disturbing. Calling gays ‘perverts’ or announcing that AIDS is‘God’s judgment’ on the gay community are just a few examples of rhetoricthat is inconsistent with our Christian call to mercy. (p. 264)This quote clearly criticizes the way Bryant and the Moral Majority discuss gay people asmilitant and perverted, almost directly referencing Falwell’s comment on AIDS. This newattitude of tolerance is certainly part of why the Christian Coalition was more successful than theMoral Majority. While the Moral Majority outrightly denounces homosexuality, the Christian45Coalition focused on denouncing “government-sanctioned approval and promotion” ofhomosexuality as this gives homosexuals special rights (p. 267). This different approachdemonstrates a change in public approval of speaking against homosexuality in such overt ways(Reed, 1996).The Christian Coalition uses this more accepting language in public spaces in order toappeal to groups outside of their narrow religious right base. Cynthia Burack describes how theChristian right narrative shifts according to whether they are talking to an “in-group” audience oran “out-group” – whether they are speaking to members of the Christian right or to a wideraudience (2008). Groups may openly describe homosexuality as an abomination in spaces onlyoccupied by the Christian right. With out-groups though, the conversation shifts to be about“special rights.” Though shadowed by the consistent rhetoric that calls homosexuality a choice,this still evokes a queerblind argument by arguing that giving rights and protections to gaypeople will lead to more inequality and unfairness overall. Christian Coalition’s ability to reachbeyond the original Christian right base may be attributed to their special rights rhetoric thatappeals to an out-group audience.There is also a shift away from overtly religious rhetoric and towards more family andmarriage-centered rhetoric, especially as the 1990s and early 2000s had more discussionssurrounding same-sex marriage being legalized. This shift away from religion and towardsfamilial tradition reflects heteroactivist arguments and the idealization of heterosexual marriageand tradition, which can be both queerblind and queer-conscious. The group Focus on the Familywas founded in 1977 by James Dobson and is still active today working against LGBTQmarriage, adoption, and parenting. Dobson wrote a book Marriage Under Fire to express thesefamily-based arguments against homosexuality. He claims that all institutions depend on46marriage, including “governments, religious fervor, and the welfare of children” (2004, p. 2).Though there are certainly some religious undertones within these family-oriented arguments,the emphasis on family and conflating religious values with family values certainly can appeal topeople outside of the religious right.This is similarly seen in the group Conservative Women for America and their rhetoricwhich describes the dangers of moving away from traditional family values. ConservativeWomen for America (CWA) was founded by Beverly and Tim LaHaye who focus on bringingconservative women into the Christian right. A lot of their activism is centered on the “defenseof the family” (LaHaye, 1998) and the importance of heterosexual marriage. Leslie DorroughSmith describes CWA’s rhetoric as “chaos rhetoric” as it attempts to naturalize and centralize itspolitical agenda by inciting fear and anxiety and by aligning its conservative Christian beliefswith mainstream American beliefs (2014). These groups discuss the dangers of homosexualityfor marriage and for children in a way that is significant not only for Christian families but anyperson who supports the institution of marriage and the healthy upbringing of children. Bydescribing these Christian perceptions of homosexuality through the rhetoric of tradition andfamily, these activist groups can align themselves beyond their narrow base attracting peoplewho believe in “traditional” families while not necessarily having to be Christian.Even as these groups of the 1990s and early 2000s focused on widening their basebeyond the Christian right of Bryant’s and the Moral Majority’s time, they still preached thathomosexuality was wrong and unnatural through their efforts towards conversion therapy andviewing homosexuality as a lifestyle. Focus on the Family and its associated branches have longpromoted conversion therapy and have held campaigns like the “Love Won Out” campaignwhich would go from town to town promoting heterosexuality and teaching people how to47overcome their homosexual desires. Tim and Beverley LaHaye from CWA co-wrote a book onmarriage and stated that homosexuality is caused by unhealthy relationships with a mother orfather, giving a psychological explanation for homosexuality and calling it a “learned behavior”(2004). This is in no way an attempt to shield their intentions under the guise of “special rights”or traditional values. These stronger efforts towards conversion show that homosexuality is nolonger just acknowledged as something experienced by perverted men and women like AntiaBryant or the Moral Majority might imply, but something that young people may experiencewithin the Christian community. This again shows a shift in the in-group and out-group rhetoricof the Christian right, where the audience may have a more direct connection to LGBTQidentities as the public grew more tolerant.Even as many of these 1990s arguments are still outwardly homophobic, these argumentsare directed towards more than just the religious right, incorporating arguments about familyvalues and special rights. Though moving towards conversion therapy activism was incrediblyharmful, it does show that groups no longer view LGBTQ people as an “other” but as someonethat could be in your own family.Queer-Conscious Early ActivismThe Moral Majority and Anita Bryant kicked off the religious right anti-gay stance withrhetoric on how homosexuality is against God, dangerous to children, and corrupting the moralsof the nation. They focused on overtly homophobic arguments that involve religious justification,sexualization of gay people, and heteroactivist fear-mongering. This is what first brought peopleto the Christian right, building the foundational principles of Christian conservatism.The activist groups of the 1990s and early 2000s continued the work of these movementsand certainly continued to situate themselves as upholding family and Christian values.48However, these groups also changed the rhetoric to be more about special rights and familyvalues, not just religious values. This shift brought more people into the Christian rightmovement against homosexuality, broadening their base to include anyone who believed gayrights were unfair or anyone who believed that gay rights go against tradition and family. Thoughthe movement at this time still had a strong focus on religion and still preached homosexuality asa choice and immoral, they still used some queerblind arguments and even at times claimed to betolerant towards gay people.Contemporary Anti-LGBTQ ActivismThe activist groups today are different from those of the 1970s to early 2000s in a numberof different ways. The most obvious way is in the focus on gender identity and anti-trans issuesrather than solely acknowledging homosexuality. These modern groups are also not all explicitlyChristian. There are some that focus on parental rights, taking religion out of the discussion. Thissection investigates the rhetoric and arguments used by Christian activists today as well as looksat recent secular groups and the queerblind frameworks they use.Religious Activism TodayThere are still a number of groups using biblical arguments today to oppose LGBTQidentities. Some of these groups were formed back in the 1980s or 1990s, but have continuedtheir work and somewhat changed their approach. Focus on the Family is still working today,continuing to promote the nuclear, heterosexual family through biblical allusions and religiousrhetoric. They changed their language to apply more to anti-trans beliefs, touting their “value ofmale and female” and stating that God created humans to be “intentionally and immutably maleand female” (Focus on the Family, 2022). They also use this line of reasoning againsthomosexuality, saying that God made men and women “to need each other” with the purpose of49making families. These arguments are meant for Christians and are used to validate anti-LGBTQbeliefs.This biblical rhetoric has shifted, though, when compared to earlier examples. AnitaBryant and the Moral Majority often refer to homosexuality as sinful and dangerous, paying lessattention to particular Bible verses to justify their argument. Focus on the Family is not alwaysso black and white with their anti-LGBTQ beliefs. One article on their website features a fatherasking what to do about his daughter in a relationship with another woman. The article respondsby saying that different people interpret the Bible in different ways, and since the daughter isgrown up, there is little to do to change her (Canfield, 2022). This shows how in individualcases, Focus on the Family can be somewhat understanding towards homosexuality.This understanding, though, is not extended to transgender people, who are deniedvalidation and are referred to in dangerous and unnatural terms. Their website has an articleentitled “Keeping Your Family Safe in Public Restrooms” describing the dangers of findingsomeone of the opposite sex in the bathroom. They also describe the ways that “predators” takeadvantage of gender-neutral bathrooms and laws allowing transgender people to use thebathroom associated with their gender identity, creating an association between transgenderpeople and predators (Johnston, 2016).This same argument is used by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) which is a Christianlegal interest group that works to diminish LGBTQ rights, increase Christian presence in publicschools, and restrict abortion. They describe trans people, and especially transwomen, asdangerous and abnormal. ADF uses the same bathroom arguments describing how dangerous itis for cisgender women to be using bathrooms that are accessible to transwomen, again puttingcisgender women as victims and making transwomen out to be predators. This kind of predatory50treatment of transwomen is seen a lot today and is very reminiscent of how gay men were treatedin earlier decades. There are surely a number of reasons why anti-LGBTQ activists have chosento target gay men and transwomen – whether it be due to views about masculinity and discomfortwith a feminine presentation on biologically male bodies, or if it is because it is easy toempathize with children and cisgender women as victims of “predators.” Either way, thesemovements have continuously been able to build fear over LGBTQ identities by sexualizingthem and not seeing queer people as anything beyond their gender identity and sexualorientation. This shows the continued use of queer-conscious sexualization which unabashedlyand purposefully sexualizes queer identities to make an argument.ADF also continues to position ciswomen and children as the victims of LGBTQ rightswith heteroactivist frameworks as well, describing the dangers of straying away from traditionalgender and family norms. Their website states, “But when culture fails to respect and promotemarriage, countless individuals, particularly women, children, and the underprivileged, sufferneedless emotional and material hardships” (Alliance Defending Freedom, 2023). This showshow straying from traditional marriage and families will lead to severe societal and economicproblems. These sorts of arguments are not unfamiliar, and have been used since the 1990s asthey uphold heterosexual marriages as sacred and good, and any kind of digression away fromthat mold as sinful and wrong.Though ADF does utilize these openly homophobic and transphobic frameworks, theyprimarily use legal arguments to oppose LGBTQ rights. Hannah Dick examines this group’srelationship with the Christian right, showing how they evolved from the culture wars started bythe Moral Majority, only with more of a focus on the legal arguments (2021). The group uses anetwork of attorneys to argue cases of parental rights and religious rights in anti-LGBTQ cases.51They emphasize how anti-discrimination laws and schools teaching about LGBTQ issues are inviolation of the first amendment and religious freedom, framing these issues around Christianpersecution and schools pushing a secular agenda. These arguments show how religious freedomarguments are used today.The same is done with the parental rights arguments on their website which argues thatschools “indoctrinate” children to certain beliefs and practices without the parents’ consent. Theyalso argue that parents have the right to send their children to “counseling” with reference toconversion therapy. These parental rights arguments are being made more and more, attractingthose who may disagree with the religious freedom framework but agree that parents should havemore of a say in their children’s health and well-being.The frequent use of the word “indoctrination” to describe educating children on LGBTQissues and referring to LGBTQ inclusivity as pushing a political agenda also echoes the politicalframework. Rather than just framing these as issues of parental rights or religious rights, ADFdescribes these issues as being about pushing an agenda onto children that may go against whatyour family or religion may believe. ADF has an article describing teaching about trans andgender issues as “Gender Theory” and describes it as a radical agenda that teaches thatheterosexual and cisgender people are oppressors and members of the LGBTQ community arethe oppressed. The descriptions of gender theory are very reminiscent of how Critical RaceTheory is brought up in conservative groups, describing it as an educational method used withkids to describe white people as oppressors and people of color as oppressed. ADF is trying tolight a similar fire with the phrase “Gender Theory” by describing its use in schools as politicaland harmful to children – especially straight, cisgender children. By making anti-discrimination52policies for trans kids out to be about pushing a political agenda onto kids, people are more likelyto align themselves with ADF and its causes (Alliance Defending Freedom, 2022).Both Focus on the Family and Alliance Defending Freedom openly use homophobic andtransphobic statements through biblical, heteroactivist, and sexualization frameworks. Still, evenwithin these frameworks, there is an attempt at appearing less homophobic by being moreaccepting of individual cases. ADF also uses some queerblind frameworks in the form of legalarguments which claim that LGBTQ rights are in opposition to religious freedom and parentalrights, as schools become more and more political. Even with this occasional use of queerblindframeworks, these religious groups are still comfortable with queer-conscious language,especially when directed toward trans rights.Activist Groups Outside of the Religious RightThere are also a number of groups that are not explicitly centered around religion thatworks to fight against LGBTQ rights. The two groups I investigate use parental rights as theirplatform to oppose LGBTQ rights in schools. The groups, Moms for Liberty and ParentsDefending Education, were both formed in 2021 and are far more queerblind than any earliergroup as they avoid making any comments about LGBTQ identities.Moms for Liberty is the most well-known group working today and was founded inJanuary 2021. Rather than explicitly talking about religious freedom, this group insteadadvocates for liberty more generally, referencing parental rights as well as schools becoming toopolitical. The group uses similar legal arguments as ADF, claiming that this is about the firstamendment and the values of the country. Rather than making comments about LGBTQidentities, they instead choose to talk about the rights of parents and the lack of liberty inschools. They list their values as “We Stand for Truth, We Build Relationships, We Empower53Others” (Moms for Liberty, 2022), and further on only mention liberty and free speech, notclearly siding against LGBTQ people as their true goal.Moms for Liberty also talk about how schools attempt to indoctrinate children. A videofrom their website states, “Our schools are becoming indoctrination camps and a breedingground for hatred and division” (Moms for Liberty, 2022). This kind of language can appeal toparents who not only do not want their kids learning about LGBTQ identities but parents who areagainst mask mandates or against Critical Race Theory. By discussing LGBTQ rights as highlypoliticized issues comparable to advocating for a particular candidate in school or discussingcomplex gender theories to elementary schoolers, these groups are able to appeal to more parentswho may not be openly against LGBTQ rights in theory.Despite these arguments being targeted at LGBTQ rights, there is no direct mention ofLGBTQ identities on their website. This approach is obviously queerblind as it separates parentalrights and upholds liberty from their opposition to LGBTQ issues. Despite this avoidance, theystill uphold some forms of sexualization arguments by advocating to ban books that have toomuch “sexual content” (Lopez & Pollock, 2021), when it is clear that these books are banned dueto their LGBTQ themes. Regardless of what framework Mom’s For Liberty is using, there is anintentional effort to be queerblind and not appear homophobic or transphobic.Another group utilizing similar methods is Parents Defending Education which goesagainst both Critical Race Theory and LGBTQ issues in schools. This group similarly focuses onparental rights and liberty, even including a proposed parental rights amendment on theirwebsite. They also work to appear queerblind throughout these frameworks. They appearnonpartisan, stating that their group is “from diverse races, religions, economic backgrounds, and54political orientations,” (Parents Defending Education, 2023) identifying themselves as secularand moderate.This group, like the others, warns of how current education is indoctrinating students andpromoting an “activist” agenda. Similar to ADF’s “Gender Theory,” this group mentions “criticalgender theory” as a radical gender ideology that is being taught to children as young askindergarten (Parents Defending Education, 2023). This argument politicizes teaching aboutLGBTQ issues, making it out to be an agenda pushed by activists trying to indoctrinate children.By framing the issue this way, they are not aligning themselves with homophobic andtransphobic beliefs, and just claiming to be against pushing political agendas onto children.Both Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education show a change in howanti-LGBTQ activism is done. Neither of these groups explicitly mention LGBTQ identities andprimarily focus their rhetoric on noncontroversial values like liberty and rights. They refrainfrom any intentional heteroactivism, sexualization, or religious frameworks, not appearing to betargetting LGBTQ people directly.Queerblind Contemporary ActivismThe current activism has clearly moved to be more queerblind and more centered aroundparental rights and political frameworks over more queer-conscious frameworks that directlycriticize LGBTQ identities. Still, there is a clear difference between the religious activist groupsand the more secular ones. Christian right anti-LGBTQ activism is still rooted in biblicalarguments and often makes statements that invalidate LGBTQ identities, especially transidentities. Secular activism centered around parental rights tries not to mention LGBTQ issues atall, reframing its anti-LGBTQ activism as really being about parental rights and liberty. Even55with these differences though, it is clear that anti-LGBTQ activism is more queerblind in today’srhetoric.Anti-LGBTQ Activism Over TimeEarly anti-LGBTQ activism centered around bringing together the religious right inopposition to LGBTQ acceptance, using biblical, heteroactivist, and sexualization frameworks toinvalidate and dehumanize queer people. Over time, this anti-LGBTQ movement had to movepast its narrow base and address wider audiences. This meant using more family-orientedheteroactivist arguments and special rights arguments that can appeal to more people outside ofthe Christian right. Still, this 1990s period of anti-LGBTQ activism continued queer-consciouslanguage by pushing conversion therapy and viewing homosexuality as a choice. It was not untilcontemporary LGBTQ activism that queerblind rhetoric became the norm. Though religiousgroups still tend to use biblical arguments calling LGBTQ identities anti-God, the focus hasshifted more towards rights-based arguments and liberty. The legal arguments that began witharguments about “special rights” have broadened to be about liberty, parental rights, andpoliticized education. The focus on homosexuality has also shifted to focus more on transgenderand gender nonconforming identities. The predator comparisons made about gay men have nowshifted to be about transwomen, and in both instances defending these homophobic andtransphobic generalizations by citing the protection of women and children.Other groups like Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education do notacknowledge religious freedom and instead, advocate for liberty more generally and parentalrights. Through also focusing on the politicization of education, rather than religious freedom,the groups appeal to broader audiences that do not just include the Christian right but any personthat is against critical race theory, gender theory, or mask mandates. These groups no longer can56afford to make blatantly homophobic statements and instead use rights arguments to justifydenying LGBTQ education and anti-discrimination in schools. Queerblind language is becomingmore normal and more subtle as activist groups are not only utilizing queerblind frameworks butomitting words related to gender and sexuality completely. By completely reframing thesearguments to be about parental rights and politicized education, people could agree with thesegroups without supporting homophobic or transphobic statements. This increased queerblindnessin activism and in the culture more generally can lead to some worrisome results, which I discussin the next chapter.57V. Discussion and ConclusionThroughout this thesis, I have described the various rhetorical frameworks that are usedagainst LGBTQ communities in order to understand how opponents of LGBTQ rights appeal tothe American public. I proposed queerblind rhetoric as an explanation for how these argumentsare framed, and why this contemporary anti-LGBTQ movement is so successful. Here, Isummarize my results, look at the impact, and say what needs to be done in response.Discussion of ResultsAs I suspected when beginning my research, there are many ways in which anti-LGBTQrhetoric has shifted to become more queerblind – more hesitant to explicitly say somethinghomophobic or transphobic and more hesitant to even name LGBTQ identities. Despite this,there are also ways in which the rhetoric and arguments surrounding LGBTQ issues have notshifted and continued to uphold openly homophobic and transphobic arguments. I discuss herehow laws and activism have become more queerblind as well as what has remained the same.QueerblindWhen looking at the laws and activism prior to the 2000s, the language used towardsLGBTQ identities is intentional and cruel, using words like “lifestyle,” “sin,” and “militant” todescribe gay people and LGBTQ experiences. The resounding theme of the laws and activismwas an open opposition towards the humanity of queer people. The laws used sexualizationframeworks, referencing AIDS and sodomy as a basis to show queer people as more sexuallydeviant. The activism took this a step further, using biblical arguments, sexualization, andheteroactivism to show why LGBTQ are invalid and sinful. Though there were certainly someexceptions to this rhetoric, politicians and activists were never shy at this time in their oppositionto homosexuality.58The anti-LGBTQ policies and activism of the modern day are far more queerblind, bothin how they completely omit terms related to gender and sexuality and in how they attempt toappear unbiased. Policies today often use political arguments and parental rights frameworks intheir anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws. Florida’s law reasons through banning gender and sexualitythrough parental rights, unlike the earlier laws which use explicit sexualization or homophobia asa basis for discrimination. Activism today has also changed significantly with parental rights,religious freedom, and political arguments becoming more popular.This increased queerblindness indicates the changes in the culture at large surroundingLGBTQ individuals. Over the past 20 years since the earlier period of anti-LGBTQ curriculumlaws, a lot has changed legally and culturally for queer people, with more widespread visibilityand understanding surrounding sexuality and gender as being on a spectrum. Even groups likeFocus on the Family show some empathy towards individual gay people saying that people caninterpret the Bible differently. Queerblindness is used in order to not appear homophobic in aculture that no longer accepts blatant bigotry.This increased queerblindness also reflects an argumentative strategy that denies LGBTQpeople the appearance of discrimination and adversity. Frameworks using parental rights,religious freedom, and special rights, make it clear that LGBTQ people are not victims ofdiscrimination in the modern U.S. and the real victims are the parents, children, Christians, and“everyday” people who are losing rights due to increased LGBTQ education in schools. Thiskind of queerblind framework is obvious in laws like Florida’s as it focuses its framework onparents and parental rights as the victim, while only briefly mentioning gender and sexuality.This queerblindness can even be seen in older laws, like the special rights arguments whichassume that queer people do not face discrimination and that increased rights will diminish59overall equality. This is comparable to abstract liberalism and minimization colorblind argumentsthat claim that racism is no longer a big problem and that the U.S. is a meritocracy.Whether this queerblindness is due to the cultural changes in the US since the 1990s, orif it is used as a strategy to deny LGBTQ discrimination, these frameworks and arguments areclearly becoming more and more popular in anti-LGBTQ politics and activism.What Isn’t QueerblindThough there certainly are more queerblind arguments today than there have been before,there are still some ways that the times have not changed and people are still using homophobicand transphobic arguments to promote anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws and beliefs. Though thereare still some cases where gay and bisexual people are invalidated, the language and rhetorichave primarily shifted to invalidating and condemning transgender or gender non-conformingidentities. While groups like Focus on the Family may show some acceptance towardshomosexual identities, the same cannot be said for transgender identities which are consistentlyinvalidated using biblical arguments and heteroactivist claims about the role and value of maleand female.The policies and groups from today also use sexualization arguments, and again,primarily target transgender people. This is seen in the dialog surrounding the dangers of transwomen using the women’s bathroom, purposefully calling them dangerous and predatory insimilar ways that these groups referred to gay male teachers. Though people are not ascomfortable now calling gay men predatory and malicious, the same cannot be said about transidentities with many more people viewing gender nonconformity as wrong and potentiallydangerous. This is also not just limited to activism, as policies like the national anti-LGBTQ60curriculum bill call things like drag queen story hours “sexually-oriented” (Stop theSexualization of Children Act, 2022).This shows how even if many lawmakers and activist groups use queerblind logic insome instances regarding homosexual issues, the same arguments are not always extendedtowards trans and gender nonconforming people who continue to face scrutiny in thecontemporary culture. It has become normal for activists and policymakers to reinforce thegender binary and invalidate any identity that does not conform – promoting religious rightconcepts as though they are American norms and values. The fact that politicians and activistgroups can comfortably use these frameworks and arguments against transgender people showsjust how much more needs to be done moving forward.Impact and Moving ForwardImpactFor this section, I would like to address how these queerblind policies have impactedLGBTQ youth and the culture at large. There is not a lot of research that has looked at howLGBTQ youth are impacted by anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws specifically, though there is someshowing LGBTQ feelings overall. The most recent school climate survey from 2021 shows that58.9% of LGBTQ students experience some form of discriminatory policies or practices inschool. The mental health and safety of trans and gender nonconforming youth is also moresignificant than cisgender LGBQ youth, with 77.3% of transgender students and 69.1% ofnonbinary students reporting that they are discriminated against compared to 46.1% of cisgenderstudents. Even before states began writing anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws in 2022, there were stillhigh levels of LGBTQ students experiencing some form of discrimination in schools. LGBTQstudents experiencing discrimination in schools also had lower GPAs, less sense of belonging to61their school community, lower levels of self-esteem, and higher levels of depression (Kosciw,Clark, Truong, Zongrone, 2022). It is clear that experiencing discrimination in schools – whetherthat be preventing students from expressing their LGBTQ identity or preventing students fromusing bathrooms or locker rooms aligning with their gender identity – can lead to increasedproblems not just with student mental health but with school work and high school graduation.The focus on schools also has larger implications for what is deemed acceptable in thewider culture. Schools have long been used as a political proving ground for the culture at large,using children and children’s needs to project racist, homophobic, and transphobic ideas onto theculture at large. By showing LGBTQ identities as unsuitable for children and anti-discriminationas too political, a message is sent to the culture at large about how acceptable LGBTQ people areas a whole. Especially through using broad language about gender and sexuality, the extent towhich LGBTQ children and adults may be targeted and criminalized is still unclear. By trying tosilence messages that it is okay to be gay or trans, schools do not just remain indifferentbut make a claim that it is not okay to identify as LGBTQ.Moving ForwardThis paper has named and identified how queerblindness is used in anti-LGBTQarguments and in what ways it is manifested in policies and activist groups. My hope is that thisanalysis of frameworks will push the literature forward towards more analysis of queerblindlogic in other anti-LGBTQ politics surrounding gender-affirming care, LGBTQ exclusion fromextracurriculars, parental opt-out laws, anti-drag laws, and more. The functioning ofqueerblindness in these different avenues of anti-LGBTQ politics certainly varies. It may also beworthwhile to look at the impact of queerblind policies on students and on opinions surroundingLGBTQ people.62Beyond just the academic goals for queerblindness, I hope that this thesis gives insightsinto how best to respond to anti-LGBTQ laws and activism. One way of doing this is byopposing the anti-LGBTQ curriculum laws themselves, which almost every LGBTQ activismgroup is doing in some way. Human Rights Campaign is one of the largest LGBTQ activistgroups working towards making political and social change. Movement Advancement Projectalso provides research showing the impact and scope of LGBTQ curriculum laws. Groups likethe ACLU are actively working to overturn anti-drag laws as unconstitutional. Activists are alsotrying to pass more inclusivity and anti-discrimination laws in schools, like GLSEN (Gay,Lesbian, Straight Education Network) and GSA Network (Genders and Sexualities AllianceNetwork) both working towards increasing inclusivity and support for LGBTQ youth in schoolsthrough providing research that indicates the importance of inclusivity and anti-discrimination inschools. The focus for much of this activism is spreading awareness of these laws and showingthe impact of laws on the well-being of LGBTQ youth.There may also be more success on the local level and in individual school districts asparents and teachers speak up against censoring LGBTQ education, especially when their kidsidentify as LGBTQ. The group Support Our Schools specifically works to combat parental andreligious rights groups through supporting education that is inclusive for all students. This hashad some success locally (Gibson, 2023) and shows how “parental rights” can go both ways. Thegroup PFLAG also provides support to parents and families to combat LGBTQ discriminationfrom the local level to the national level.But beyond pushing for inclusivity and anti-discrimination laws in schools, what else canLGBTQ activists do? Many groups focus less on politics and more on changing the culturalclimate of the United States. This can be seen in groups like GLAAD which work to increase the63visibility and acceptance of queer people. This certainly can help dispel beliefs about trans andqueer people by helping more people see LGBTQ people as people beyond their gender identityand sexual orientation.There can also be more acknowledgment of queerblindness as a phenomenon by pointingout these queerblind arguments. Activists have already been doing this by penning the ParentalRights in Education Act in Florida as the “Don’t Say Gay” law. This phrasing cuts through allthe parental rights arguments and acknowledges the real purpose of the law. But even beyondthis, more needs to be done in order to change queerblind acceptance within the culture at large.Colorblind scholars have acknowledged the ways that unconscious bias and stereotyping can stillexist in people fighting for civil rights and people against racism. The same can be said for biastowards LGBTQ people, where even as most people would not identify as homophobic ortransphobic, many still have unconscious bias and uphold harmful stereotypes about LGBTQpeople. People may agree with arguments that sexualize trans people or ones that call LGBTQeducation too political, without necessarily seeing how those arguments are homophobic andtransphobic. Through educating people on the historical context of anti-LGBTQ curriculum lawsand the ways that some older arguments have shifted over time, people may more readilyrecognize their biases and stereotyping. Even as visibility and political rights have increased overthe past twenty years, this does not mean that understanding has extended to all LGBTQindividuals and in every context. Schools are used as a mechanism for changing the culturesurrounding LGBTQ people, and only through recognizing our own hidden biases, will we beable to end the culture war.64ReferencesGallup.

    "abstract": "Anti-LGBTQ movements have gone through different phases in the United States as they have targeted homosexuality generally, same-sex marriage, and same-sex adoption. Despite the increasing acceptance and visibility of LGBTQ identities over the past twenty years, this anti-LGBTQ movement continues today, targeting what kids learn about in schools and LGBTQ youth generally. In this thesis, I research how opponents of LGBTQ rights frame their arguments in order to appeal to a more tolerant American public. Specifically, I analyze the rhetoric of anti-LGBTQ curriculum policies and anti-LGBTQ activism from 2022 and from an earlier period spanning from the 1970s to the early 2000s. I find that both policies and activism have changed their rhetoric to become more queerblind &ndash; intentionally avoiding terms or assigning value to LGBTQ identities. This queerblind theory is further developed by looking at how scholars have analyzed racially colorblind rhetoric that is more prevalent in modern-day racism and rhetoric. I argue that queerblind rhetoric has become more prevalent due to a more tolerant public and due to queerblindness being a more politically strategic opposition to the LGBTQ rights movement. </p",
