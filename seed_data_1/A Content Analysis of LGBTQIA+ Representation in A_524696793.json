My methodology for this study includes aqualitative method. The qualitative research conducted for this capstone project involves acontent analysis of three American animated series and three Japanese animated series. Two tothree episodes were analyzed for each series, consisting of fifteen episodes altogether. This studywill draw on Queer theory to examine and highlight how queer identities and culture are depictedin the two different forms of animation. This capstone project aims to analyze and understandhow this form of media represents queerness. This research finds that LGBTQIA+ representationin anime included sob stories and tokenism but lacked representation of queer relationships.While subversive humor, portrayals of casual queerness, and representation of setbacks werepresent in American animation.Key Words: LGBTQIA+, animation, media representation, queer theory4IntroductionThe history of Animation began even before cinema, but Disney’s Steamboat Willie(1928) was the first sound-synchronized animated cartoon. Early animation was simple;primitive means were used to simply comedic and childish short films. Animation was dismissedas infantile for a long time, but that idea progressively started to diminish (Dobson, 2010). Fastforward a few decades later, animated shows like The Simpsons, King of the Hill, Daria, andmuch more deal with much more serious issues and topics. Such animated shows challengesocial norms, traditional family values, and boundaries of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, andqueer representations (Johnson, 2010). Animation content has changed over the last few decadesand continues to change; while cartoons can still be comical, they also touch on quite seriousissues and topics.Animation has always had a history of queerness. There is a long history of constructingor subverting reality, extending the boundaries of anatomy, gender, and sexuality in animatedanimals and human characters. Unconcealed references to homosexuality have been present inanimated shows as early as 1932 in Max Fleischer’s cartoon Any Rags. In 1934, the HollywoodProduction Code was enforced, which banned any \"sex perversion or any inference to it” in anyfilm (Griffin, 2004). As a result, creators found new creative ways to insert queerness andextended the boundaries of the production code (Blodget et al., 2019; Griffin,2004). Queer codedtheir characters through mannerisms, customs, speech patterns, friendship dynamics, and more toget around the censorship code creators. While there has been an increase in LGBTQIA+representation in animation over the past few decades, the representation has not all beenpositive. In animation, the villainization of queer characters, persistent tropes, and stereotypesare still present (Santos,2019).5Through this capstone, I examine and compare LGBTQIA+ representation in Americanand Japanese animated television series to better understand how both cultures explore andportray gender and sexuality. Through conducting a qualitative content analysis of threeAmerican animated series and three anime series, I had the opportunity to analyze and comparehow such mediums portray the LGBTQIA+ community. This capstone project answers thefollowing research question: In what ways, if any, does LGBTQIA+ representation in Animecompare to queer representation in American animation? This capstone first reviews the previousliterature, focusing on three prevalent themes: queer coding, queerbaiting, queer resistance, andheteronormative resistance in animation. I then comprehensively discuss the methodology Iutilized to collect the data and answer my research question. I will then go on to present andanalyze my findings. This capstone will conclude with my conclusion and recommendations forfuture research.Literature ReviewIntroductionQueer characters have always been present in American and Japanese animation, butthere has been an increase in queer visibility in recent years. There are several pieces of literatureon the area of LGBTQIA+ representation in American cartoons, from adult animated sitcoms tochildren's animated series(Brennan, 2018; Dennis, 2003; Dhaenens et al., 2012; Dhaenens, 2014;Dunn, 2016; Johnson, 2010; Kim et al.,2007; Lugo-Lugo et al., 2009; Perea, 2018; Ravela, 2017;Raymond, 2013; Santos et al., 2019). The literature on LGBTQ representation in Anime, on theother hand, is extremely limited (Blodget et al., 2019; Garg, 2019; Hoskin, 2018). To betterunderstand how the LGBTQIA+ community is portrayed in the medium of animation, I will6incorporate previously scholarly works to expand on the analysis of my research. Afterreviewing the literature available, the three major themes discussed more often are queer coding,queerbaiting, queer resistance, and heteronormative resistance.Queer Coding in AnimationQueer coding is a way around censorship in Animation, characters may not be explicitlystated to be queer, but there is enough subtext for an audience to read them as such (Dennis,2003; Perea, 2018). Queer coding can occur verbally and visually, and these identity markers canbe anything from dialogue, behaviors, images, songs, clothing, jokes, background design, andeven secondary characters and friendship dynamics (Perea, 2019). Cartoons can and must beapproached through three different though interconnected areas. These areas are production,audience response, and textual analysis, animators can introject, and audiences can decodesame-sex desire and queer characters (Dennis, 2003). It is important to note that some queersignifiers found in animation do not necessarily hint at queer sexuality,” it is about many otherthings—outsider identity markers that change with time in a social structure that shapes ouridentities through performativity” (Perea 2019, p.8). Outsider identity signifiers in animationsuch as Lilo & Stitch and Dumbo hint those characters have experienced otherness and, in return,have found a “chosen family;” this helps form the definition of queer identities (Perea, 2019).Cartoon characters often exhibit a mix of masculinity and femininity features that leavemore room for subtext and interpretation (Dennis, 2003; Johnson, 2010; Santos, 2019). Malenon-human Characters such as SpongeBob from SpongeBob SquarePants and “Him” from ThePowerpuff Girls both can shift between a display of overt masculine aggression and flowingfeminine passivity. This, therefore, leaves more room for interpretation (Johnson, 2010; Santos,72019). Characters such as “Him” also display characteristics that are assigned to the femalegender, such as his clothes, shoes, and makeup, such characteristics of his character challenge thebinary order culturally accepted as \"normal\" between gender and sex (Santos, 2019).SpongeBob’s character facial design is a blend of masculine and feminine signifiers. Hisexaggerated eyes and, eyelashes, rosy cheeks are all associated with feminine characteristics,while his long-extended nose and wide-tooth mouth are male signifiers (Johnson, 2010). Thecharacter of Bugs Bunny has appeared in drag in various episodes over the years. He caneffortlessly adopt many female signifiers while also discarding his traditional masculine traits;this can be read as a representation of gender ambiguity (Dennis, 2003; Johnson, 2010). Suchcharacters that display subtexts of cross-dressing and exhibit a mix of feminine and masculinesignifiers challenge the traditional notion of anatomy and gender; their asexual blank slate opensthe door for analysis and interpretation (Johnson, 2010).Animation hints at same-sex relationships through friendship dynamics and cartoon duos;characters are often coded as romantic partners. Although characters are not explicitly identifiedas queer, there are enough subtexts to pinpoint same-sex desire through an interaction betweentwo same-sex characters (Blodget et al., 2019; Dennis, 2003). The lack of providing sufficientbackstory or details of a domestic situation in animated shows” opens a space to subverthegemonic heterosexuality and allow same-sex desire or identity into the reading” (Dennis 2003,p.133). Participating in social events as a couple or sharing a living space, refusing or failing topursue a romantic relationship with the opposite sex, or visibly expressing desire through flirtingcan all be identified as signifiers of same-sex desire (Dennis, 2003; Johnson, 2010). There arevarious animated shows where same-sex relationships triumph over heterosexual desire, andcharacters such as Yogi and Boo Boo are identified as romantic couples (Dennis, 2003).8Steven Universe is believed to be the queerest and most gender-progressive children’sanimated show on television because it allows genders outside the spectrum to exist and flourish(Dunn, 2016; Ravela, 2017). Steven Universe makes use of its narrative magic to pushboundaries of gender representation, its ability to push the representation of genderqueer andagender characters such as Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl (Dunn, 2016; Ravela, 2017). Garnet,Amethyst, and Pearl are known as crystal gems (extraterrestrial species). They all seem to takeon female forms and pronouns but are described as agender and state their feminine gender traitsas illusory (Dunn,2016). The magical ability of the gems known as “gem fusion” opens the doorfor further queer representation in the show. The gems can fuse their bodies together throughfusion to achieve a greater magical and physical power. Through this spectrum, the show canaddress agender desire and genderqueer representations (Dunn, 2016; Ravela, 2017). In order tofuse their bodies together, the gems must perform musical segments known as the'' fusion dance”(Dunn, 2016; Ravela, 2017). The fusion dance is interpreted as a queer performance thatexpresses a queer desire (Dunn, 2016; Ravela, 2017). It is certain that fusion is a semi-sexual ordesire-coded occurrence between the gems (Dunn, 2016). There are a number of reasons whyfusion is believed to be a semi-sexual occurrence, including one of the gems deemed the danceinappropriate for young Steven (main character) to see, the body language of the dance itself,and coded desires such as flushed cheeks, heavy breathing, and daringly deep dips (Dunn, 2016).Fusion becomes a source of pleasure, frustration, and longing for the gems (Ravela, 2017).Throughout the seasons of Steven Universe, a new character named Stevonnie is introduced,which is a fusion of the main character Steven(male) and his best friend Connie (female).Stevonnie does not (either physically or mentally) fit within female or male categories, makingthem deliberately genderqueer; the character also displays androgynous physical features (Dunn,92016). Trans representation in Steven Universe aims to separate gender identity from sexualorientation, physical sex characteristics, and gender presentation (Dunn, 2016).Queerbaiting in AnimationQueerbaiting is a marketing technique used by writers and networks to gain queerviewers’ attention and support by hinting at homoerotic suggestiveness without ever actuallydepicting such queer relationships or sexual interactions. (Brennan, 2018) Unlike queer codingqueerbaiting such homoerotic hints are usually shut down with denial and mockery, once morereinstating a heteronormative narrative (Brennan, 2018). The definition of queerbaiting isever-changing, and it can vary depending on the viewer, context, cultural expectations, andnorms (Garg, 2019). It is important to note that queerbaiting can happen beyond the domain ofthe text and can also be present in the paratext. This means producer-led texts that result frominteractions between fans and producers that encourage fans’ queer interpretations (Garg, 2019).The definition of queerbaiting is redefined in the context of cartoons aimed at children;the unresolved subtext is not erotic but instead romantic. Superficial background queerrepresentation without commitment or direct representation within the text is a form ofqueerbaiting in children’s animation (Blodget et al., 2019). Therefore, this feeble representationis easy to ignore and deny by audiences and studios; this allows heteronormative resistance todevelop (Blodget et al., 2019). Queerbaiting is often used as a strategy to “protect” children fromqueer sexualities (Blodget et al., 2019). This is referred to as the oppositional, compulsoryheterosexual politicization of the child viewer, who must be sheltered from all queer sexualities(Blodget et al., 2019). Queerbaiting in children's animated shows is less about creators anddirectors benefiting from it but more about the ongoing power struggle of queer representation10and fear of losing “straight” dollars and viewers. Due to this fear, characters are lowered to an“easter egg” queer, relying on paratextual knowledge and readings to not affect the series'success with homophobic viewers (Blodget et al., 2019). This leads to late affirmation withqueer-coded relationships. They are only labeled queer in the show's final moments when thecommercial viability is no longer at risk. This positions queer relationships at the lower tier ofrepresentation and pushes heteroromantic expression (Blodget et al., 2019). In series likeAdventure Time and The Legend of Korra, same-sex relationships remain unlabeled until theshow's final moments. This setup of relationships within the two series shows audiences thatonly queer couples must remain canonically unacknowledged (Blodget et al., 2019). These queerrelationships in Adventure Time, The Legend of Korra, are never acknowledged within the bodyof canon works; instead, there is a brief or unexplained indication of these relationships (Blodgetet al., 2019). Animated shows like Adventure Time and The Legend of Korra acknowledge queerrelationships and characters but still lack the representation, continual affirmation, andacceptance that matters for presentation (Blodget et al., 2019).Free! Iwatobi Swim Club and Yuri!!! On Ice, both demonstrate queerbaiting in verydistinct ways. For example, Free! Iwatobi Swim Club signifies queerbaiting more traditionally bytaking advantage of homoerotic situations between heterosexual characters without ever pursuingany homosexual relationships (Garg, 2019). Anime series such as Free! Iwatobi Swim Club ispopular in the fujoshi culture due to the physicality of attractive male bodies in close proximityto each other and the intensity of male homosocial bonds between the characters (Garg, 2019).Fujoshi culture can be described as a term for heterosexual female audiences that enjoy mangaand anime that feature homosexual relationships between men. Fujoshi culture can be bestcompared to a Japanese version of slash culture in Western fandoms (Garg, 2019). Such anime11series fall under the Yaoi and shounen-ai genre, best known as “Boys’ Love” (BL); while queercharacters and relationships are present, they are problematic due to the harmful portrayals ofgay men and fetishizing relationships (Garg, 2019). Such problematic portrayals do not furtherthe cause of positive queer representation and can be considered another form of queerbaitingdue to the fact that it is being marketed as queer content but does not deliver positive depictionsand desires of LGBTQ+ characters (Garg, 2019). While Free! Iwatobi Swim Club does not fallinto the “Boys Love '' genre; it shares elements found in the BL anime series.Queerness in Yuri!!! On Ice, on the other hand, is not hinted at or joked about but insteadpresented by actions displaying affection and intimacy, such as skating dance routines and apartially obfuscated on-screen kiss (Garg, 2019). Yuri!!! On Ice is free from any problematicelements and stereotypes found in the “Boy’s Love” series. While this paves the way for a morepromising positive queer representation, such representation can be easily ignored or dismissedby viewers due to its lack of explicitness and remaining canonically unacknowledged (Garg,2019). While the series portrays markers of an intimate relationship, the lack of sexualexplicitness does not allow the relationship between the two characters to be seen as romantic orsexual (Garg, 2019). Creators often use this technique; this can also be a non-traditional form ofqueerbaiting in animation (Garg, 2019).Queer Resistance and Heteronormative Resistance in AnimationDespite the increase in queer representation in television over the years, many argue thatnetworks continue to evoke dominant ideologies that reinforce heteronormativity (Kim et al.,2007; Raymond, 2013). Animated sitcoms such as American Dad and Family Guy usegender-/sexuality-based associations that aim to critique social gendered and sexual stereotypes12through parody but rightfully fail at it (Raymond, 2013). While this aim to critiqueheteronormativity, it can be interpreted as pocking fun at the closed-minded stereotype of gayidentity, while others might interpret them as an accurate depiction of queer behavior. Regardlessof the different interpretations by different viewers, the associations aiming to critique socialstereotypes instead re-create hegemonic divisions we often see on television (Raymond, 2013).Animated sitcoms are marked with an undeniable double-codedness. Many viewers applaud suchsitcoms for their undeniable satire, while others, despite them, for their subversiveness towardsqueer representation (Dhaenens et al., 2012; Raymond, 2013).Contrary to what Chase Wesley Raymond discusses, Frederik Dhaenens states that queerresistance is segmented into queer themes and characters with the aim to expose or/and disruptnormative patterns and notions from within (Dhaenens et al., 2012; Dhaenens,2014). It isimportant to understand that while television can strengthen and reinforce such dominant notionsof gender and sexuality, it can also destabilize and disrupt heteronormative ideals (Dhaenens,2014). Sitcoms such as Family Guy apply postmodern strategies such as exaggeration,literalization, and hyper stereotyping to create queer resistance (Dhaenens et al., 2012). Althoughsitcoms such as Family Guy can question, mock and critique heteronormative ideas andpractices, they are not allowed to offer political stances or transgressive counter-discourses.While they refrain from taking any political stance, the content they create can be interpreted asqueer resistance (Dhaenens et al.,2012). As a consequence,” queer resistances in the adultanimation sitcom thus most likely reside in between the articulations of complicity and critique,sometimes masked as pastiches putting outdated stereotypes of queerness to the fore, andsometimes as parodies holding normative and repressive practices up to mockery” (Dhaenens etal. 2012, p.135)13While Sailor Moon is a Japanese cartoon, it has found popularity in the United States.Like many other Japanese series, Sailor Moon was repurposed for American audiences (Blodgetet al., 2019; Hoskin, 2018). Queer characters, relationships, and depictions of gender fluidity inSailor Moon were censored from the North American version (Blodget et al., 2019; Hoskin,2018). Two men in a romantic relationship were rewritten with one male character as a woman,while the relationship between Sailor Neptune and Uranus (both female characters) wasexplained away as “cousins” (Blodget et al., 2019; Hoskin, 2018). Queerness found in SailorMoon was not translatable in North America, and such complexities of queer identities anddesires were lost in translation. Such censorship is interpreted as heteronormative resistance thatmaintains heteronormativity and normative bodies (Hoskin, 2018). Queer characters found in theoriginal Japanese version of Sailor Moon fell outside of the normative hetero identities andtherefore abjected from the Western world and dismissed from the cultural imaginary (Blodget etal., 2019; Hoskin, 2018)Heteronormative resistance is exceptionally present in Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorksAnimation (Lugo-Lugo, 2009). Children’s animation aggressively enforces heterosexualrelationships and banter in what might seem like pointless scenes. For example, in the animatedfilm, The Road to El Dorado, heterosexual relationships are introduced after a series of sceneswhere the two main characters’ (both male) sexuality could be fabricated as unclear.(Lugo-Lugo, 2009). Their sexualities are presented unclear because of coded desire for oneanother after both men had bathed naked together. Shortly after a heterosexual relationshipbetween one of the male characters and a female character (Chel) is introduced, this clarifies tothe audience that the two male characters are sexually “normal” (Lugo-Lugo, 2009). Suchseeming incorporations of heterosexuality into the narratives of animated films are not necessary,14and the basic message could have been served without them (Lugo-Lugo, 2009). In animatedfilms such as The Road to El Dorado, creators always find a way to incorporate a straight lovestory; this serves as a function and conveys that heterosexuality is the norm (Lugo-Lugo, 2009).ConclusionThe existing literature provides insight into LGBTQIA+ representation in children’sanimations as well as adult animated sitcoms. Children's animated series tend to queer code theircharacters in the margins. The character’s sexual orientation is not explicitly stated, but there areenough stereotypical gay signifiers that sub-textually tell audiences the character is queer(Dennis, 2003; Perea, 2018). For decades creators have found subtle ways to hint at thecharacter’s queerness without confirming it. In rare instances, some children’s animated seriesmight have slight background queer representation, but this is usually without any commitmentor direct representation (Blodget et al., 2019). This is another marketing technique used bycreators known as queerbaiting. While queerbaiting is an entertainment ploy to attract queerviewers, the objective of such a technique is different when it involves younger audiences(Blodget et al., 2019). Creators often use this technique in order for heteronormative resistance todevelop. This makes the superficial queer representation easy to ignore or deny (Blodget et al.,2019). Heteronormative resistance is present in various children’s animated shows and films(Lugo-Lugo, 2009). Heterosexual relationships and heterosexuality are strongly enforced somuch that Sailor Moon was repurposed for American audiences (Hoskin, 2018).Adult animated sitcoms, on the other hand, are marked with a double-codedness in termsof LGBTQIA+ representation. Animated sitcoms critique heteronormativity through pastiche andparody (Dhaenens et al., 2012; Raymond, 2013). Scholars argue that such postmodern strategies15create a text that can be read as being able to both recalculate and reverse hegemonic discourses.(Dhaenens et al., 2012). These postmodern strategies can also be interpreted as subversivenesstowards queer representation. While television can use these postmodern strategies todemonstrate queer resistance, these articulations of resistance can only become resistant whenaudiences are able to read them as such (Dhaenens, 2012).TheoryThe primary theory I discuss in this capstone project is queer theory. Queer theory is nota theory in the traditional sense; it is characterized by various methods of cross-examining desireand its relationship to identity. It aims to question and challenge heterosexual norms andembraces what is nonnormative (Watson, 2005). The queer theory is not a unified body of workbut, instead, one that continues to evolve and aims to understand the complexities of identity(Watson, 2005). Queer theory has been able to provide scholars with an insightful perspective toexplore the intercession of heteronormativity in popular media and culture. Various scholarscount on queer theory to question the negotiation of heteronormativity in media and popularculture, suggesting that television maintains a binary, rigid and hierarchical approach tobiological sex, gender, and sexuality.While many scholars rely on Queer theory to convey that popular media and culture onlyreinforce heteronormativity, others rely on queer theory to challenge that idea. A number ofscholars argue that television has the power to portray queer characters and themes that resistheterosexual norms; television can take part in representing queer resistance through two typesof representational strategies. These two broad sets of representational strategies are referred toas queer deconstruction strategies and queer reconstruction strategies. Queer deconstruction16strategies aim to resist heteronormativity along with the practices, institutions, norms, and valuesthat maintain it. (Dhaenens, 2014; Dhaenens, 2012). Three sub-strategies are present in queerdeconstruction: strategy of exposure, strategies of contradiction, and strategies of parody. Thestrategy of exposure is present in series where queer characters are aware of the heterosexualmatrix but do not oppose heteronormativity; however, the series represents such pain and angerfelt by such queer characters whose identities and desires are not considered the norm. Whilestrategies of contradiction introduce instances of queerness in settings and situations controlledby heteronormative principles, these contradictions aim to question established heteronormativenorms and values. Finally, strategies of parody aim to challenge, mock, and criticizeheteronormativity through postmodern textual strategies such as intertextuality, exaggeration,literalization, and reversal (Dhaenens, 2014; Dhaenens,2012). Queer reconstruction strategies, onthe other hand, go beyond that and aim to represent queer and practical alternatives to theheteronormative way of living. Queer reconstruction can be present in two ways; the first isqueer identities and desires are presented as intelligible or queer institutions, and practices arerepresented as more practicable and preferable ways of living compared to the heteronormal way.Queer theory can be used to explore and challenge scholars that aim to expose television as amedium that solely restates heteronormativity and instead argue that television is capable ofsubverting heteronormativity (Dhaenens, 2014; Watson, 2005).Heteronormativity has the power to institute a social-cultural hierarchy between subjectswho fall into heterosexual norms and subjects who do not or cannot conform to such ideals.Queer theory can address questions of non-heteronormative bodies that do not conform to suchheteronormal ideals. In this piece of literature, “queer” is interpreted as all bodies that areawkward, erotic, and challenge the established norms of society and culture. (Santos et al.,172019). This piece of literature draws from other studies and their ideas that queerness is the bodymanifested by the resistance of the heterosexual matrix. While such queer bodies can be presentin animation and are resistant to the heteronormal, they often are portrayed as villains orsomething to fear. Such popular television tropes bring forth harmful queer stereotypes. Suchflawed representation allows the audience to associate immorality with queerness. (Santos et al.,2019).MethodologyThere are various methodologies in social research. Among them is content analysis.Content analysis is potentially one of the most important research methods in the social sciences(Krippendorff, 2004). The term content analysis has various definitions, including a research toolfavorable for making inferences by systematically and objectively identifying detailed messagesfrom verbal, visual, or written data to describe and unify phenomena (Bengtsson, 2016).Krippendorff defines content analysis as” a research technique for making replicable and validinferences from texts (or other meaningful matter) to the contexts of their use” (Krippendorff,2004, pg.18). As a research method, content analysis has both quantitative and qualitativemethodology, and it can also be used in both an inductive and a deductive way. (Bengtsson,2016; Krippendorff, 2004). The difference is that qualitative content analysis is numerical. Factsfrom a text are presented in the form of frequency expressed as a percentage or actual numbersof key categories. In contrast, qualitative content analysis data is presented in words and themes,making it possible to draw interpretations of the results (Bengtsson, 2016). Qualitative contentanalysis can be used in either an inductive or deductive way. Deductive analysis generally meansapplying predetermined codes to the data whole inductive analysis is more of an exploratoryapproach codes/themes emerge as the research goes through the data. Before beginning a content18analysis, the research must also determine whether the analysis should be manifest or latent. In amanifest analysis, the research describes the actual literal subject matter in the text, while in alatent analysis, the research seeks to find the underlying meaning of the text (Bengtsson, 2016;Duriau et al., 2007).There are various advantages associated with content analysis over other methods.Content analysis can be described as an unobtrusive technique. This means that this datacollection method does not interfere with the subjects/phenomena under study. Since suchmethods are not obtrusive, there is less chance to create contaminated observations. Contentanalysis is also context-sensitive. This permits the research to process data texts that aresignificant, informative, and even representational to others. Another advantage of this method isthat content analysis can cope with large volumes of data. While this method can cope with largevolumes of data, it can also be used to analyze small samples of texts. Content analysis canperform small-scale studies with minimal requirements (Duriau et al., 2007; Krippendorff, 2004).Analytical flexibility is another key strength. This reverts to the two levels of analysis mentionedearlier: manifest and latent content. The analysis of content can be conducted at either level. Inaddition, this method can also be used to conduct inductive and deductive research, which addsmore flexibility (Duriau et al.,2007; Krippendorff, 2004). A significant advantage of contentanalysis lies in the coding scheme. If the research finds any flaws with the coding scheme alongthe way, they can be corrected. Content analysis can also be used in conjunction with othermethods in an effort to support the understanding of an experience, meaning, or process. Finally,some additional advantages of content analysis are that it is an inexpensive research method, andthis method can handle the unstructured matter as data (Duriau et al., 2007; Krippendorff, 2004).19Qualitative content analysis has a history in the social sciences and social research(Bengtsson, 2016). Unlike quantitative content analysis, the qualitative content analysis approachprovides the researcher with comprehensive and clear meanings and insights into the text beinganalyzed. QCA is an effective approach that allows researchers to understand social reality orphenomena objectively but scientifically (Shava et al., 2021). QCA is flexible, and data can beverbal, visual, sampled from other sources, or collected by other researchers. The data can beused non-reactively. The data does not need to be collected from interviews or questionnairesand can be collected from home. Researchers can conduct an analytic study of newspaperaccounts, magazines, archives, television shows, films, social media, and various content(Bengtsson, 2016; Shava et al., 2021). Like any other research method, some limitations comewith qualitative content analysis. The one significant weakness of QCA is that it might not beappropriate for open, explorative research since it is limited to examining already recordedmessages. QCA can also be a labor-intensive, time-consuming process (Shava et al., 2021). QCAhas certain advantages and disadvantages, but the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.Qualitative content analysis is a practical research tool that allows researchers to makecomparisons across different media, including comparing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,intersex, queer/questioning, and asexual (LGBTIQIA+) representation in Japanese and Americananimation.This qualitative research focuses on identifying how the LGBTQIA+ community isportrayed across two different mediums of animation: Japanese and Western animated series.The goal is to better understand what type of representation is included and not included and toidentify and unpack the play of dominant ideologies within mainstream texts. The animatedseries selected for this study were identified through anime blogs, GLAAD annual reports and20personal knowledge. The criteria for the show were to have at least one explicit queer character,that character had to be a main character or recurring supportive character. The series could notbe older than the year 2010, the first season had to be aired no later than that year. I analyzedthree Japanese and three American animated series, two to three episodes per series. I examineda total of fifteen episodes altogether. For the anime series I chose Paradise Kiss, Wandering Son,and Stars Align. For the American series I chose Big Mouth, BoJackHorseman and Kipo and theAge of Wonderbeasts. After selecting the content and getting familiar with it, I then transcribedevery episode to text. I began coding the selected texts manually in three coding stages.Beginning with a low level of abstraction with initial codes, and then gradually moving to highlevel of abstraction with axial codes and focused codes.Findings & AnalysisThe content analysisof the three Japanese animated series presented three recurringthemes: sob stories, tokenism, and lack of portrayals of queer relationships. My analysisofAmerican animated series and the portrayal of LGBTQIA+ characters determined three mainrecurring themes: subversive humor, representation setbacks, and casual queer representation.Portrayals in AnimeThe LGBTQIA+ community has had a long history of complicated, offensive, and oftencoded representation in film and television. One of the biggest issues media has had withrepresentation comes from unrealistic, exaggerated, and offensive stereotypical portrayals ofqueer characters. All three-anime series analyzed portrayed all queer characters in a refreshingand non-stereotypical way. The portrayal of non-binary/gender-questioning Yuta and transgenderShou from Stars Align; openly bisexual George and transgender Isabella from Paradise Kiss;transgender Yoshino, Shuichi, and Yuki from Wandering Son offer a portrayal that viewers at21home can identify with. All three series presented a realistic portrayal of queer issues and queerexperiences but lacked representation of queer relationships and proper queer characterdevelopment.Sob StoriesThe anime series explores journeys and stories, and along with those stories, many queerissues and struggles arose throughout the series. This type of representation is what is called “sobstories,” realistic depictions of the struggles that many individuals from the LGBTQIA+community face. One of the struggles discussed in all three series is gender and social dysphoria.Gender dysphoria can be described as the feeling of discomfort or distress that might occur inindividuals whose gender identity differ from their sex assigned at birth or sex-related physicalcharacteristics. There is a scene in Stars Align when we learn about the transgender characterShou and his struggle with the discomfort of wearing a girl's uniform,” he said it didn’t feel likehis gender was right when he was young. In middle school, wearing the girls' uniform was brutalfor him, but realized no one else felt like that... His own existence made him feel uneasy andalone.” This discomfort and unease with wearing a school uniform and having to live as theirundesired gender are also present in the other two anime series. Along with gender dysphoria,the series also touches on social dysphoria, and this is where pronouns and misgendering comeinto play. In paradise Kiss, we see Isabella, an openly transgender woman, express discomfortover how she is addressed and viewed by others. In the following dialogue, we see Isabellaexpressing discomfort with her butler misgendering her:Isabella:  Good morning, Sebastian.Sebastian: You are up early.Isabella: Say, Sebastian.Sebastian: What is it, young master?22Isabella: Could we do something about the way you addressme? I’m not young either…Sebastian: But you dislike being referred to by name. Howwould you prefer to be addressed?Isabella: How about “young mistress?”Sebastian: Certainly, I will consider it if you call meUeda.Isabella: But you are still Sebastian to me.Sebastian: Just as you are young master to me.We learn that Isabella once struggled with gender dysphoria and continues to struggle with theidea of how the outside world perceives and addresses her.The three series analyzed all cast light on the LGBTQIA+ experience from variousangles. Part of the LGBTQIA+ experience is coming out, every experience is different andpersonal, but it is incredibly challenging and scary for all. Stars Align shows capture a realisticand heartfelt coming-of-age queer experience. The series follows Yuta “Yu,” who comes out asnon-binary: “I have no idea what I want to do or who I want to be…If I have to say, I think I amnon-binary. Though, it does not feel right to have to be categorized. But still, people always wantsome sort of label one way or another. How do I find out what I want or learn about who I reallyam and who I wanna become one day?” While this scene is about Yu coming out as non-binary,it also touches on the pressure of labeling one's sexual orientation and gender identity. This is anexample of what many LGBTQIA+ individuals experience in the process of coming out andcoming to terms with one’s identity. Like Yuta, many feel their gender cannot be neatly definedwithin the margins of the gender binary. While many individuals have the privilege of comingout on their own terms and time unfortunately that is not the same experience for everyone. The23anime series also sheds light on outing, which is the act of deliberately or accidentally sharingsomeone's sexual orientation/gender identity without their knowledge or consent. Wandering Sonfocuses on two queer best friends who long to transition, for most of the series, they feel theyneed to hide their desired gender identities. One of the protagonists, Shuuichi (MTF), is outed onthree separate occasions. The first time she is deliberately outed in front of all her friend as a“crossdresser”:Chizuru: Nitori, can you grab a fork?Shuuchi: Oh, Sure.Fumiya: Nitori? Nitori…Oh, I know.Shuuchi: Here.Fumiya: The Nitori who loves to cross-dress![All gasp]In another scene, she is also outed by her sister during family dinner, and in another episode, sheis outed by her sister's boyfriend. The anime also addresses the outing of another character, Yuki,who is an openly transgender woman that is who is like a mentor to both transitioning pre-teens.Yuki had a similar experience where her classmates forced her to come out,” I did not have achoice…Everybody forced me to put on a sailor uniform. They made me confess my love tosome boy I did not like.” Wandering Son sheds light on how damaging and hurtful outings canbe. Along with outing and coming out, the series also touches on experiences where queercharacters experience rejection/disapproval and bullying.Lack of Queer RelationshipsAll three anime series portrayed how important it is for queer individuals to have healthyfriendships and a strong support system, all three series lacked portrayals of queerrelationships/romance. All anime series analyzed in this capstone project set out to show how24important allyship and healthy, strong friendships can be for queer individuals. In Paradise Kiss,Isabella is encouraged to dress and be who she wants to be by her butler and close friend,George; in Wandering Son, both Suuchi and Yushino are able to get through all the hardships,adversity, and shame imposed on them by others due to their friendship and support for oneanother; in Stars Align Yuta is surrounded by friends that respect and care for them. When Yutais being bullied or made uncomfortable throughout the series, his friends and teammates makesure to come to his aid. During a scene in the locker room, a classmate strips his shirt in front ofYuta, who purposely keeps their eyes forward. The classmate notices this, and he says.” Huh?Come on, look at this! Aren’t you—” before he can finish his sentence he abruptly gets cut off asYuta’s friends come to their defense yelling,” Cut it out. Our manager is sensitive. That is right.He is bad at dealing with rude brutes like you.”While there is plentifulness of scenes like this one showing strong support systems, thereis a lack of queer relationships in all three anime series. In Paradise kiss, one of the maincharacters is a proud bisexual fashion student, but throughout the series, he is in a relationshipwith straight, cisgender women, and his bisexuality is put on the backburner. Isabella, who is atransgender woman and George’s best friend, has been in love with him since she couldremember, yet that relationship was not explored further. The anime neglects to give her anyromance or relationship development of any sort, unlike the other straight leading characters.This is a recurring theme in Stars Align as well; while it is revealed that Yuta has a crush on thecaptain of the tennis team at the beginning of the anime, that storyline is not further explored oraddressed for the rest of the anime. The anime series did not feature any queer relationships butthere was an abundance of hetrosexual relationhsips.Token queer25A form of representation that is not entirely good representation is token representation.Token representation occurs when a queer character is introduced but does not play a notable rolein the plot or does not have their identity meaningfully explored. The characters are not tied intothe plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect. All three anime serieshad more than one explicit queer character, but two out of the series had token characters. Thesecharacters had far less screen time and were not developed sufficiently or were not essential tothe plot. The majority of the queer characters in the anime series were limited to one specificepisode dedicated to their sexuality, identity, or a coming-out scene, and while they were noterased for the rest of the episodes, they were not developed further.In paradise Kiss, episode nine is dedicated to Isabella and her identity. Unfortunately, thatis the only episode when Isabella is given a good amount of screen time and characterization. Forthe rest of the series, Isabella’s character is not further developed and receives very minimalscreen time occupying scenes in the background making tea, preparing snacks, or giving adviceto other characters. In addition to receiving less screen time and no character development, theone episode that is supposed to be dedicated to her identity somehow is ultimately more abouthow one of the main characters got into fashion. This episode focused on her coming out storyand the first time she ever wore women's clothing, but it is more about her best friend Georgeand the power of fashion than about Isabella,” I couldn’t be born as a girl, but by dressing as agirl… I was given a magical hope. Beautiful dresses give people courage. With that belief, I’vebeen making dresses with George.” Token characters are also present in Stars Align; non-binaryYuta, and transgender Shou receive less screen time, and their characterization is limited to asingle episode and remain in the background for the remainder of the series.American Animation: Subversive Humor26Past animated shows have used queer characters for laughs to reinforce negativestereotypes and tropes of the LGBTQIA+ community. My analysis demonstrates that while theshows use humor, they do not make queer characters the butt of the joke. Big Mouth is ananimated series about a group of teenage friends going through puberty. The animated series hasopened discussion for a range of issues and hardships young people face during puberty,including sexual identity through raunchy humor. The show does not shy away from discussingand joking about taboo topics, but it does so in a way that does not come across as homophobic.In season four, the show introduces a new character, Natalie, a transgender teenage girl. Duringher introduction in the first episode of the season Natalie is deadnamed multiple times, quizzedby the boy campers on why she “decided” to become transgender as well as ask her a series ofinvasive questions, she is also deals with forms of gender policing from the girl campers whowant to make her “pass” as a girl. Instead of passively tolerating all this casual transphobia, shethrows back insults and sticks up for herself:Nick: Uh, are you going to sleep here?Natalie: No, I’m staying in the girls’ bunk.Background character: Nice, nice. So this is all a scam so youcan just watch, you know, girls change and stuff?Natalie: Yep. You figured out my master plan.Background character: Do you pee standing up or lying down?Natalie: The fuck? Do you pee lying down?Seth: You know what, everyone? I'm just gonna ask the thingthat we're all thinking but not asking. What does your crotchlook like?27Natalie: Oh, God. This is a disaster, but don't cry. They'llthink you're weak, and they'll pounce. My crotch looks like theback of your mom's head while she's slurping me off.This specific scene utilizes humor to purposely highlight various popular transphobic argumentsand then rapidly shuts them down. In season three, the show also touches on biphobia when Jay,one of the characters, comes out as bisexual. While the portrayal of bisexuality was notcompletely accurate (I will further discuss this later) in this season, it did mention various waysbisexuality is invalidated, fetishized and the double standards for men and women. After comingout as bisexual Jay experiences biphobia by many of his classmates, in a specific scene hisbisexuality is dismissed:Jay:I don't know if you heard any of what I just said,but, uh, pretty sweet I'm bi, huh?Mathew: Oh, honey, you can just say you're a top, youdon't have to say you're bi.Jay:What?Mathew: How do I say this? Usually, when a guy comes outas bi, he's just making a rest stop on his way to GayTown.Jay:Gay Town sounds fun, but I have thought a lot aboutit, and I belong in Biami. [chuckles]Caleb:Biami is not a real place.Mathew:See, Caleb gets it.This is one of many various harmful ways bisexuality is often invalidated, the idea that it doesnot exist. Individuals that come out as bisexual are going through a phase or are just confused or28undecided and will ultimately realize they're either homosexual or heterosexual. Other bisexualsterotypes discussed include only coming out for attention:Jay:Hey,hey! So?Andrew:What?Jay:What about my big news?Andrew:Oh, that you're bi? Yeah, we just assumed that wasa ploy for attention.Jay: What? No way! Seriously, guys, I'm bisexual.The double standard of bisexuality is also addressed, bisexual men are stigmatized whilebisexual women are fetishized in society:Nick: Yeah, we're, we're pretty uncomfortable with this.Andrew:No judgment, bi's-- bi's weird.Jay: You guys suck. When you heard that Ali was into guysand girls, you thought it was so cool.Andrew:Because in her case, it is. I mean, Ali has verysmooth, porcelain skin. She's number one on my skin list.Nick:I guess what Andrew's trying to say is bisexualityjust feels different for boys than girls.Jay:Well, that's totally fucked!Andrew:Yeah, man, you're right, it's a double standard.But standing here with you half-naked, ah, I'm a littleuncomfortable.These two specific scenes realistically and correctly shed light on common insults/stereotypesand immediately shuts them down. Jay’s portrayal of bisexuality in a queerphobic society issomething that many queer individuals can relate to.29Representation setbacksWhile animated series like Big Mouth, do not shy away from exploring various aspects ofsexuality and sexual orientations, that does not mean that their portrayals are by no meansperfect. Unfortunately, in season three the animated series only got some things right aboutbisexuality and pansexuality and missed the mark on certain aspects of their portrayals. In seasonthree a specific scene undid a lot of the great work the animated series had done as far as queerrepresentation. The show introduced a new character, who proudly introduces herself aspansexual:Ali:Okay, um, I play soccer, I'm a Ravenclaw, and not to makeall you normies shit your Old Navy undies, but I am pansexual.Nick: Uh, hi, Nick Birch, Gryffindor. The pansexual thingsounds intriguing. Could you speak to that some more?Ali: Pansexual means I'm into boys, girls, and everyone inbetweenNick:I thought that was bisexual?Ali:No, bisexuality is so binary.The shows attempt to depict distinctions between bisexuality and pansexuality was wrong forseveral reasons. To begin with claiming bisexuality is “so binary” is incorrect and a quitecommon assumption many individuals have. This assumption is not only in correct, but it put outthe dangerous message that bisexuals are only attracted to cisgender men and females and is notinclusive of transgender and non-binary identities. Bisexuality means you can be physically,romantically, and/or emotionally attracted to people of more than one gender. Ali goes on toexplain her own identity with a food metaphor that does not correctly define pansexuality,“Being pansexual means my sexual preference isn’t limited by gender identity…It is like, some30of you borings like tacos, and some of you like burritos, and if you’re bisexual, you like tacos,and burritos. But I am saying, I like tacos, and burritos, and I could be into a taco born a burrito,or a burrito, that’s transitioning into a taco. And honey, anything else on the fucking menu.”There is a lot of things wrong with this definition of pansexuality, not only did the showdescribed it with astonishing binary terms but they failed to distinguish that pansexuality meansthat someone is attracted to people regardless of their gender and not that someone is attracted toall genders. “Using ‘burritos’ and ‘tacos’ as stand-ins for genital organs is a dangerous binaryconstruction of the spectrum of biological sex but shows a troubling depiction of transgenderindividuals. The troubling description of transgender identity, “a taco that was born a burrito”/ “aburrito that is transitioning into a taco” implies that transgender individuals are of a separategender all together and that they need affirmation through medical transition. This description oftransgender identities is very harmful and dehumanizing. While the show did an excellent jobaddressing the stigma affecting bisexual men go through hey failed to define bisexuality andpansexuality accurately and respectfully.Casual Queer RepresentationThere are not many television shows that portray casual queerness, especially animatedshows. BoJack Horseman and Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts’ are an exception. Bothanimated shows are an example of casual representation, and this is when a character is part ofthe LGBTQIA+ community, but they are not solely defined by their sexuality or gender identity.Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts' is the first children's animated show that explicitly andcandidly used the word “gay.’” This animated show did not wait for the last episode to confirmthe queerness of a character, dance around the characters' sexuality or queer coded them. Inepisode four of the first season of Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts,’ the main character31Kipo works up the courage to confess her feeling for Benson another main character. To mysurprise he kindly tells her that he does not see her in a romantic way not because there isanything wrong with her but because he is gay:Kipo:I don’t know if it’s that I’m turning 13, but I feeldifferent right now.And I feel like I need to tell you that…[sighs] I think I like you.Benson:Oh…Oh! Oh…Kipo:[sighs]You don’t feel that same.Benson:Oh, no! No, I like you, too.Really, really like you!You’re all kinds of awesome!But you should knowsomething…[chuckles]Kipo:You like me as a friend.Benson:Yes!Because… I’m gay.Kipo:Oh…[gasps]Oh!I totally misread your signals.Is it OK if Icurl up into a ball right now? Thank you, though, for just, uh,I don’t know, being you?OK, that was a really dumb thing tosay.I think I’m just trying to say, I’m glad we’re friends.Bensons’ coming out was not made into a huge deal, but it was not ignored by characters aroundhim either. The show soon moves on to the plot of the episode but that is not the only timeBenson's queerness is portrayed in the show, unlike other children's animated series that rely onone single major coming out moment/episode followed by no references to a character’squeerness. Throughout the series there Bensons' queerness is not pushed to the backburner, thereis a development of a romantic relationship. Bensons and Troy’s relationship is portrayed in themost nonchalant way possible; they have scenes professing their love for each other, a promproposal scene and many heartfelt scenes of them flirting, embracing and kissing. The seriesdoes not shy away from displaying queer romance, When Troy and Benson meet for the firsttime the two lock eyes, the screen turns pink and a song starts playing with lyrics explicitly32referencing falling in love with someone,” Can it be true…Think I’m falling in love with you.You make me feel so blue.” Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts' is a notable example ofrespectful and positive queer diverse representation, not only does the series provide astraightforward and casual attitude to Benson's and Troy’s’ sexuality, their romantic life andsexuality are important but do not define them, and they are LGBTQ characters of color.BoJack Horseman is another example of diverse casual portrayal of queerness. Theseries is not known to shy away from addressing topics that are considered taboo and normallyignored, like depression, addiction and detrimental illnesses, abortion, and asexuality. Asexualityis an underrepresented orientation in all mediums of media, BoJack Horseman is the only serieswith a openly asexual main character where his identity is adequately explored but does notdefine his character. Todd’s asexuality is portrayed in a realistic and genuine way. In the end ofthe third season Todd’s asexuality is hinted at when his ex-girlfriend questions his sexuality:Emily:Todd, can I ask you something?Todd:Of course.Emily:What’s your deal?I feel like you like me, but you don’tlike me but you like me. And I don’t know what that is.Are yougay?Todd:Whoa. Why would you even–?Emily:You can tell me if you’re gay. It’s fine.This isn’t the1600s or some places in the present.Todd:I’m not gay. I mean I don’t think I am.But I don’t thinkI’m straight, either.I don’t know what I am.I think I might benothing.Emily:Oh well, that's okay.Todd:Yeah?Emily:Yeah of course.This scene is a very realistic depiction of what it is like to be asexual in a society that struggles tosee anything beyond “straight” and “not straight. Todd’s’ response is also a realistic, relatability33portrayal of what it is like questioning and struggling to come to terms with yoursexuality/identity in a society where asexuality is ignored. In season four, Todd finally comes toterms with his sexual orientation and comes out as asexual:Todd:I guess they’re not gonna put you in the best friend hallof fame.But I don’t know that I loved her. I don’t think I’mallowed to be in love.Bojack:Don’t say that. You do so much for everybody.Todd:Thanks.It was shitty what you did with Emily, but, um…I think I’m… asexual.Bojack:A sexual what? Dynamo, deviant? Harassment jawsuitwaiting to happen?Todd:No. Asexual,not sexual.Bojack:Ohh.Todd:I’m sure you think that weird.Bojack:Are you kidding? That’s amazing.Todd: It actually feels nice to finally say it out loud.I am anasexual person.I am asexual.These two scenes are an example of how both friends react with acceptance and withoutjudgment. Both reveals are acknowledged but not made a big deal, and the show carries onnormally after. Todd’s’ asexuality is thoughtfully explored and intertwined throughout the rest ofthe series. Todd is portrayed as a character that happens to be asexual and not an asexualcharacter that is entirely defined by his sexuality.AnalysisThis study finds that Japanese animated series representation of the LGBTQIA+community includes sob stories, tokenism, and a lack of portrayal of queer relationships, whileAmerican animated series portray queerness through subversive humor and casual queer34representation but also face setbacks with the inability to accurately define queer sexualorientations. When discussing diverse and meaningful representation in spaces such asanimation, there are various criteria to look at. First, is the representation diverse in terms ofrepresentation of various sexual orientations, gender identities, and racial diversity? Secondly,does the portrayal of queer characters pass the Vito Russo test? Lastly, if they pass the test, is therepresentation accurate and unproblematic?After analyzing both American and Japanese animated series depictions and portrayals ofqueer characters, the data shows that American animation had the most diversity when it came tothe number of various identities and sexualities portrayed. Out of all 3 Japanese animated series,there were a total of 8 canon queer characters; 5 of them were transgender, two of them werebisexual, and one was non-binary. In the American animated series episodes, there were a total ofsix canon queer characters: two gay men, one asexual, pansexual, transgender, and bisexual. Theresults show that in Anime, there is a high representation of transgender characters, but othersexual orientations are underrepresented. In American animation series, various sexualities andidentities are represented. Racially diverse queer characters are extremely hard to come by in anyform of media, and there is no surprise this statement holds true to animation. Out of all six queercharacters analyzed in the American animated series, only two were people of color. Now, it isno secret that most anime characters are Japanese, given the fact that anime is from Japan, butmany series have introduced other POC. With this being said, anime has the potential ofportraying racially diverse queer characters, but unfortunately, that is not the case. When itcomes to anime, racially diverse queer characters are almost non-existent. My findings concludethat there is also a lack of representation of queer POC in both animated mediums.35According to GLADD, the Russo test is designed to analyze how LGBTQIA+ charactersare represented in fictional work. To pass the analytical test, the following must be true: the filmor show contains at least one character that is identifiably lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,and/or queer, and that character must not be solely or predominantly defined by their sexualorientation or gender identity, and the character must be tied into the plot in such a way that theirremoval would have a significant effect. My data concludes that none of the anime series weresuccessful in passing the analytical test. While all three series included at least one character thatis part of the LGBTQIA+ community, the other two criteria were not met. Stars Align andParadise Kiss fail to pass the second and third requirements. The queer characters arepredominantly defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity, and their removal would nothave a significant impact. Wandering Son has identifiable queer characters, and they are tied intothe plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect, but they are solelydefined by their gender identity. In comparison, all three American animated series passed theRusso test. Queer characters in Big Mouth, BoJack Horseman, and Kipo and the Age ofWonderbeasts are not solely defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity and are tiedinto the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect.While passing the simple test is a step in the right direction toward positive andmeaningful queer representation, that does not mean that the representation is free of problems oroffensive content. It is important for media to include substantial, multidimensional queercharacters that pass this simple test, but it is also important to portray these characters in arespectful, accurate, and non-problematic way. While the three American animated series passedthe Russo test, it does not mean that all were free of flawed representation. Big Mouthspecifically had some setbacks with their queer representation. While they had done an excellent36job in the previous seasons, there were a few problematic scenes. Their definition of bisexualityand pansexuality missed the mark by perpetuating stereotypes that surround both sexualities. Theother two American animated series were free of problematic portrayals. While none of theanime series passed the Russo test, that does not mean the representation was necessarilynegative. All three anime series were free of problematic stereotypes and portrayals. Therepresentation of queer characters was tokenized, which is one of the reasons they did not passthe Russo test. In conclusion, while the American animated series passed the analytical test, notall representation was unproblematic and accurate. Queer representation in anime was fairlyaccurate but not free of flaws either. In terms of all three criteria discussed above my dataconcludes that American animation had overall better queer representation compared to theanime series in terms of quantity and quality.ConclusionDespite the extensive and undeniable progress regarding LGBTQIA+ visibility andrepresentation over the past decades, there is no denying that significant issues remain withrespect to the quantity and quality of portrayals of sexual and gender minorities in animation. Inregard to my research question my findings show that American animation representation of thequeer community subverts negative stereotypes through humor and portrays queerness in a verycasual way, but there were some flaws with inaccurate definitions of sexualities. Therepresentation of the LGBTQIA+ community in anime series contained realistic struggles thequeer community face, token characters, and there was lack of queer relationships. My findingdemonstrates that there has been undeniable shift in how the LGBTQIA+ community isportrayed in the last few decades but there is still room for improvement. To move forward andachieve better quality and diverse queer representation the writer’s room needs to be diversified.37To truly create inclusive and meaningful queer representation there must be an increase indiversity behind the scenes. Majority of writers and directors are straight, cisgender, white male,which needs to change in order to achieve better representation. It is also important for writersand directors to at least do research on the sexuality or gender identity being portrayed if theyaren’t part of the group themselves.This work expands upon previous literature by providing a qualitative study on how twoforms of animation portray characters that are explicitly stated as queer. Past literature focusedon queer coded characters in children and adult animated series (Brennan, 2018; Dennis, 2003;Dhaenens et al.,2012; Dhaenens,2014; Dunn, 2016; Johnson, 2010; Kim et al.,2007; Lugo-Lugoet al., 2009; Perea, 2018; Ravela, 2017; Raymond, 2013; Santos et al., 2019;(Blodget et al.,2019; Garg, 2019; Hoskin, 2018). By focusing on two distinct cultures scholars can begin tounderstand how LGBTQIA+ representation differs in both forms of animation in terms of qualityand quantity.Limitations and future researchThere were some limitations to this qualitative study including time strains and limitedcontent. Due to the limited time I had to complete this study, I was only able to analyze fifteenepisodes total. A sample of more episodes might paint a better picture of how the LGBTQIA+community is portrayed in both forms of animation. This research opens ways for furtherresearch of the LGBTQIA+ community and their portrayals in animation. My study was limitedshows in streaming services, this opens the possibility to explore and compare how queerrepresentation in streaming services and cable TV differ. Another suggestion for future researchinvolves comparing LGBTQIA+ representation in the two common forms of audiovisualtranslations in anime, subtitled and dubbed. There has been a history of major changes in various38anime series once sold and brought to American audiences. A big example is Sailor moon, in theEnglish-dubbed version two queer characters were rewritten as cousins (Hoskin, 2018). Furtherresearch on the English-dubbed and the Japanese-subbed versions of anime series could expandon this research. A final suggestion for future research includes analyzing and comparing howanimation portrays queer POC characters versus White queer characters. All suggestions wouldcontribute to queer studies and media studies.39BibliographyAkane, K. (Writer), & Akane, K. (Director). (2019, November 7). Episode 5 (Season1, Episode5) [TV series episode].

    "abstract": "This capstone project examines the ways the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+) community is portrayed in Japanese and American animation and the differences or similarities the portrayals share. My methodology for this study includes a qualitative method. The qualitative research conducted for this capstone project involves a content analysis of three American animated series and three Japanese animated series. Two to three episodes were analyzed for each series, consisting of fifteen episodes altogether. This study will draw on Queer theory to examine and highlight how queer identities and culture are depicted in the two different forms of animation. This capstone project aims to analyze and understand how this form of media represents queerness. This research finds that LGBTQIA+ representation in anime included sob stories and tokenism but lacked representation of queer relationships. While subversive humor, portrayals of casual queerness, and representation of setbacks were present in American animation",
