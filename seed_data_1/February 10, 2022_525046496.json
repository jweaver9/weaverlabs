MISSISSIPPIANTHEDailytheDMonline.comThursday, February 10, 2022 Volume 110, No. 19 Anti-Critical Race Theory legislation alarms some UM students and facultyWhen every Black lawmaker in the Mississippi state Senate walked out in January in protest of a bill prohibiting the teaching of critical race theory in the state’s public schools and universities,  all eyes were on Mississippi, yet again. Their seats sat empty — a loud gesture in the quiet Senate chamber — as their white counterparts passed the controversial legislation.Weeks later, as Senate Bill 2113 has moved to the House of Representatives for consideration, many students who fill classroom seats and the professors who teach them at the University of Mississippi are worried that passage of the anti-critical race theory legislation into law will be devastating to their freedom to teach and learn fair and accurate information about the history and current circumstances in Mississippi and the United States.What is (and what isn’t) critical race theory?Before moving into the national spotlight over the past two years, critical race theory had a robust history stretching back to the 1980s. Spanning multiple intellectual disciplines and  primarily studied by post-undergraduate scholars, critical race theory is — simply put — a way of examining and understanding the intersections of race and law in America.Yvette Butler, an assistant professor of law at the University of Mississippi, teaches Law 743: Critical Race Theory. Despite extensive legislative pushback against critical race theory in Mississippi classrooms, hers is the only class in the state that deals with the topic.“Critical race theory is, essentially, a post-Civil Rights Era way of asking why the law hasn’t fixed racial inequality,” she said. “The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is one of our main statutes that basically says in employment, in public accommodations you can’t discriminate against people on the basis of race, sex, national origin, etc.”The Civil Rights Act marked a turn in the fight for equality in the United States.“And despite that, obviously, we still have a variety of racial inequities, gender inequities — critical race theorists are like, ‘Let’s investigate the reasons behind that,’” Butler said.Like many who are familiar with critical race theory, Butler sees the legislation likely being advanced beyond its face value as a bill promoting equality. Rather, she sees it as a product of widespread politicization, of pushback against advancements made after George Floyd’s death in 2020 and of a lack of understanding as to what critical race theory even is.“I do not think my definitions match (theirs), because their definition is wrong,” Butler said. “Because I don’t think they’ve taken the time to learn what it is and I don’t think they care what it is.”For example, people opposed to the teaching of critical race theory often claim CRT seeks to label all white students as inherently bad people and all VIOLET JIRA thedmnews@gmail.comILLUSTRATION: MICAH CRICK  / THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIANWood Security masks up campus Hospitals need nurses SEE CRT PAGE 2Mississippi hospitals are in critical need of 3,000 registered nurses and have stepped up efforts to recruit and retain them, even tapping the state’s nursing school students for reinforcements, but an upcoming graduating class of 727 nursing students will likely not be enough to close the gap.Many nurses and nursing students are drawn away from Mississippi by the promise of increased benefits and earning potential.Senior nursing student Olivia Howie at the University of Mississippi Medical Center plans on staying in the Jackson area for a year or two in order to gain experience before applying for a travel nursing position.“I don’t plan on staying in Mississippi long-term,” Howie said. “Of course, who knows what the future will bring, but I’m looking for more opportunities to grow in my career that I feel Mississippi can’t offer.”Howie credits lower salaries and fewer opportunities for advancement as two of the reasons she does not The Baptist Memorial Hospital-North Mississippi.FILE PHOTO: RACHAEL ISHEE  / THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIANA long-standing security patrol at the University of Mississippi has joined with student ambassadors in the fight against COVID-19 on campus.Charlotte Thrash of Wood Security followed a student into the POD at Lamar Hall and asked, “Miss, would you mind wearing a mask, dear?”The student turned around and began patting her pockets to find her mask. “I’m so sorry,” she responded, then put on her mask in a hurry.Wood Security has been working with Ole Miss for more than five years. Some of their existing duties include monitoring crosswalks, assisting during game days in the Grove and fire watch — when a fire alarm is broken, they ensure the building is safe while it’s being fixed.Wood Security’s newest duty for the university is mask enforcement.“Honestly, it would help so much if every dorm and Greek house would keep a box of masks and hand sanitizer next to the front door,” Thrash said. “A lot of students just absolutely forget. They’ve got so much on their minds. This time of year, they’re taking a lot of tests and …”Thrash pauses briefly to ask a student to pull her mask over her nose.“Thank you dear, I sure appreciate that.” Her grandmotherly tone garnered a smile from the student.Her tone turned serious while she STACEY SPIEHLERthedmnews@gmail.comSEE MASK PAGE 3 SEE HOSPITAL PAGE 3MAKAYLA STEEDEthedmnews@gmail.comPAGE 2 | THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN | 10 FEBRUARY 2022non-white students as oppressed, with nothing that can be done about either situation. According to Butler, a core tenet of critical race theory is that there are no inherent differences between races.“Critical race theory rejects any sort of inherent differences between races because it was often founded in pseudoscience that was just like, black people are inferior,” she said. “So why would critical race theorists buy into any sort of inherent differences? That wouldn’t make sense.”Keyona Sutton, a biochemistry major at the University of Mississippi, is concerned about the legislation, even though she doesn’t think it will greatly impact her education in the sciences at the university.“I just don’t think it’s going to push Mississippi in the right direction at all education-wise. I just don’t see its purpose. And I don’t understand who it’s to protect either,” she said. “My roommates — they’re political science majors and education majors and they’re really upset about it. I have conversations about it over dinner all the time. And they tell me that their professors are already talking about how it’s gonna affect the way that they teach. That’s crazy.”James M. Thomas, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Mississippi, has researched critical race theory extensively. He, too, sees a disconnect between anti-CRT advocates’ definition of critical race theory and what critical race theory actually is.“They’ve taken the concept of critical race theory and they’ve turned it into what in academics we would call an empty signifier. What that means is it’s now a concept devoid of its original meaning, and you can shove any meaning you want into it,” he said. “So now critical race theory is Marxism. It’s civil rights history, it’s post-reconstruction history, all these things that don’t have anything to do with the critical legal framework.”Both Butler and Thomas see the legislation as being unnecessary.What is the legislation?Described as “Critical Race Theory; prohibit” on the Mississippi Legislature website, SB 2113 caused Mississippi’s 14 Black senators to walk out. Authored by 21 Republican senators, the term “critical race theory” is never coined in the bill’s text. The bill is also short and non-specific — at just over 500 words, the bill proposes a withholding of state funds for public institutions of learning that affirm, adopt or adhere to the following tenets:(a)  That any sex, race, ethnicity, religion or national origin is inherently superior or inferior; or(b)  That individuals should be adversely treated on the basis of their sex, race, ethnicity, religion or national origin.House leaders have until March 1 to pass the legislation out of committee or the bill will die.“This bill is not changing anything about our past,” Sen. Micheal McLendon said as he presented the bill in January. “All this bill says is no child shall be told they’re superior or inferior to another. That’s all this bill does.”McLendon and most lawmakers in the Senate support the passage of the legislation. Gov. Tate Reeves, too, has voiced his support for the removal of critical race theory from schools. In his 2022 State of the State address, Reeves called on the State Board of Education to “combat critical race theory” despite the board’s insistence that CRT is not being taught in any public primary or secondary school.“I am calling on the State Board of Education to adopt the values that combat critical race theory in their educational efforts. To affirm that Mississippi’s public educators will not indoctrinate students in ideology that insists this country, or this state, are inherently racist. We will not teach that your race determines your status as a victim or oppressor,” Reeves said.Because of the bill’s brevity and non-specific language, many people have written off the bill as harmless. It seeks to prevent things that are already outlawed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and subsequent legislation. However, some like Thomas see the bill’s vagueness — which poses opportunities for variance — as its threat.“Policymakers pass policy, but then people on the ground have to put it into action. When a law is unclear, what often happens is that the interpretation of that law will be kind of all over the place,” he said.Thomas described the bill as a “blank check — some school districts and school administrators will see its passage and change nothing. Others may see it and use it as an opportunity to alter the curriculum and remove certain standards under the guise of adhering to the law. Some teachers may be hesitant to teach as they did before the bill’s passage, altering their lesson plans out of fear.” This, says Thomas, is SB 2113’s threat.“When a law is unclear, the interpretation of how it should be practiced is going to be varied, and that variance is itself a threat. It’s going to create uneven educational opportunities, uneven educational practices,” he said.Conversely, the authors of the bill see it as necessary — despite SB 2113’s principal author, McLendon, saying as he presented the legislation on Jan. 21 that he is “not aware” of critical race theory being taught at any school in the state.There have also been concerns raised that if passed, SB 2113 would violate the constitution, specifically with regards to its attempts to codify what is taught at Mississippi’s higher learning institutions. If passed, the bill could violate the academic freedom of professors.“We would, of course, have to see the final form of any legislation, but I think any state law that seeks to limit topics for scholarly inquiry, especially ones such as CRT that have a strong academic legacy, could certainly raise concerns over constitutionality, such as in relation to freedom of speech and academic freedom rights,” said Neal Hutchens, a professor and associate chair in the Department of Higher Education and affiliated faculty in the UM School of Law.The Institutions of Higher Learning, the governing body for all of Mississippi’s public universities, declined to comment, as the bill has yet to become law.House Bill 437Another anti-critical race theory bill introduced in the Mississippi House of Representatives earlier this legislative session was much more prohibitive in its restrictions. The Teaching Racial and Universal Equality, or TRUE, Act was proposed by eight representatives. Unlike SB 2113, TRUE, a nine-page bill, aimed to prohibit a number of things from being taught in school, such as “race or sex scapegoating,” criticism of certain capitalistic themes, and “that either the United States of America or the State of Mississippi is fundamentally, institutionally, or systemically racist or sexist.”Broadly, the bill sought to ban what it refers to as “divisive concepts,” but to Butler, critical race theory is not divisive and shouldn’t be seen as such.“Critical race theory, while often pushing against some principles that we take for granted (and being seen as controversial in that way), is actually not divisive if divisiveness is about separating people into categories and making them enemies with one another,” Butler said. “CRT theorists often argue that we should look at the world in a way where we can create as much intergroup solidarity as possible. It was not just Black people marching for equality during the civil rights movement. It was done with people of all races. Identifying and critiquing harmful systems makes space for everyone, regardless of race, sex or other identities, to play a role in making the law and society fairer for all.”Thomas likened this bill to the wave of book bannings the U.S. has seen recently, also adding that fundamental, institutional and systemic racism are, factually, ingrained into the United States and the State of Mississippi.“There’s no debate about that. It’s not a debatable thing. That is an agreed-upon set of facts. Right. And so what they are doing is banning facts,” Thomas said.The House bill is no longer active, having died in committee on Feb. 1, but its subject matter is evergreen.Rep. Brady Williamson of Lafayette County, an author on House Bill 437 and a University of Mississippi alumnus, could not be reached for comment, despite multiple attempts.Where does UM stand?Meghan Curry is one of the students on the UM campus who finds anti-critical race theory legislation concerning. A freshman from Indianola, Mississippi, Curry passionately denounced lawmakers’ efforts to codify the way we learn.“This legislation is in no way justified at all. I kind of find it bizarre that this is coming about given recent events, with the Black Lives Matter movement,” she said. “This bill basically states that they’re going to make the white demographic, their kids and their people comfortable at the expense of knowledge to other children.”Curry, an African-American studies and public health double-major, believes that the legislation, if passed, has the potential to impact the quality of education she and other Mississippi students receive at public institutions.“I do think those bills greatly impact the quality of education that I receive as I am an African American studies major along with public health,” she said. “I feel like it’ll definitely impact the material that the teachers or professors are allowed to deliver to me but it won’t impact information that I’m allowed to access outside of the classroom, which I am fortunate to be able to say because others don’t have the same access, and with this bill, others won’t get the opportunity.”Morgan Atkins, a public policy leadership major and the Associated Student Body president, is worried about the direction this legislation takes Mississippi’s public education.“I think a lot of people were worried in the same way I am, that this starts out by saying, ‘Oh, we just don’t want to teach people that everybody’s biased.’ And it turns into, ‘We’re gonna stop letting kids learn about things that we don’t think is okay,’” she said. “And so then we start cutting out things that already aren’t super talked about, like the Black Panthers, like the Black Lives Matter movement — 20 years from now, it might not be talked about in classrooms, because they’re allowed to cut out things that could have anything to do with critical race theory.”Neal Hutchens is an expert in higher education law and policy. He worries that legislation like SB 2113 could lessen the likelihood that the teachers Mississippi needs will join and stay in the profession.“I think there are many topics involving education — such as helping to find ways to incentivize more people to become teachers and to provide better support to teachers to make it a more enriching profession — that are deserving of the legislature’s time and attention,” he said. “I worry that bills like these may actually make talented individuals less likely to enter into or to remain in education as a career.”James M. Thomas said he will not change how and what he teaches, no matter what the legislature passes.“I’m not changing how I teach. But I’m tenured. And I’m white. And I’m a dude. I’m not contingent faculty. I’m not a man or a woman of color who has to go up there and talk about a contentious issue and potentially be viewed as having an ax to grind because of the color of their skin or their gender,” he said.He worries that for university professors, the passing of such legislation will cause some professors to shy away from teaching as they would otherwise.“Our recent history at this university shows that the administration often does not support faculty who, through academic freedom, teach and write and talk about very contentious issues and then experience blowback from external actors. Our university doesn’t have a good track record of protecting us,” Thomas said. “So I don’t give a ---- if these bills pass. I’m not changing anything. I can’t say the same for a lot of my colleagues. I know a lot of them are deeply worried.”University of Mississippi Communications did not respond to inquiries about the teaching of critical race theory from The Daily Mississippian.CRTcontinued from page 1Morgan Atkins.PHOTO COURTESY: ASHLEY MILLSMeghan Curry.PHOTO COURTESY: BILL DABNEY/UM FOUNDATIONTHE DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN | 10 FEBRUARY 2022 | PAGE 3FOLLOW USTHE DM NEWS TWITTER@thedm_newsTHE DM INSTAGRAM@thedailymississippianTHE DM SPORTS TWITTER@thedm_sportsTHE DM DESIGN TWITTER@thedm_visualsTHE DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN EDITORIAL staffMADDY QUONeditor-in-chiefdmeditor@gmail.comJACOB MEYERS managing editordmmanaging@gmail.comZACH SPOONER copy chiefthedmcopy@gmail.comVIOLET JIRAnews editorthedmnews@gmail.comBRITTANY KOHNEassistant news editorthedmnews@gmail.comRABRIA MOOREassistant news editorthedmnews@gmail.comCATHERINE JEFFERSsports editorthedmsports@gmail.comRUBY DRAAYERassistant sports editorthedmsports@gmail.com HG BIGGSphoto editorthedmphotos@gmail.comLONDYN LORENZopinion editorthedmopinion@gmail.comKATE KIMBERLINarts and culture editorthedmfeatures@gmail.comVANESSA CLARKdesign editorthedmdesign@gmail.comMICAH CRICKvisuals editorthedmvisuals@gmail.comCAROLINE BEACHsocial media editor thedmsocialmedia@gmail.comARIANNA SWENSENonline editorthedmonlineeditor@gmail.comWhen it is decided that The Daily Mississippian will take an editorial stance on an issue, the following positions will make decisions as the Editorial Board: editor-in-chief, managing editor, copy chief, sports editor and opinion editor.S.

One way they’re doing this is by offering mental health resources to nurses who experience increased pressure and exhaustion due to the pandemic.“We are also intensifying our recruitment efforts, offering numerous incentive programs and continuing to make Baptist a great place for any healthcare professional to work,” Henning said.UMMC has partnered with a private company called Healthier Mississippi People to help recruit and incentivize newly graduated nurses by offering a starting hourly wage of $25.50 and a $5,000 sign-on bonus for those who are willing to make a two-year employment commitment.However, for upcoming nurses like Howie, these incentives are not enough to keep them in the state long-term. She believes the state needs nursing unions to advocate for safer nurse-to-patient ratios, higher pay and better working conditions.“For me, moving out of my home state of Mississippi has always been the goal even before I decided to go to nursing school,” Howie said.Fant echoed Howie’s concerns.“Pay is a major factor,” she said. “But also, it is illegal to form a nurse’s union in Mississippi, and I feel like nurses desperately need one.”HOSPITALcontinued from page 1talked about “the darkness” of the campus shutdown. From the initial total suspension of classes in March 2020 to the shortening of the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, students have experienced a lot of interruption to their learning.But Thrash’s voice brightened as she said, “All it takes is a mask to keep Ole Miss going.”Nate Juda, a non-traditional graduate student, also can be found in the front lobby of Lamar Hall typing at his computer. The next natural step was being hired as a COVID-19 student ambassador.“I guess this is considered a graduate assistant position, although I would have preferred something more academic,” Juda said. “I’m not with Wood Security.”Juda stops to ask a student to put his mask on before he comes in next time.“You can absolutely tell the people who forgot to put theirs on. It’s an immediate reaction, and it’s usually in their hands,” Juda said. “They have a lot on their minds.”If a student forgets to bring a mask altogether, Juda keeps a box on his table and a few bottles of sanitizer.The university is monitoring COVID-19 data, cases and guidance from health officials and will continue to adjust protocols according to updated information.The UM COVID-19 Dashboard showed a total of 36 active on-campus cases as of Feb. 8.MASKcontinued from page 1A discarded, disposable mask lies in the grass outside the student union on the campus of the University of Mississippi.HG BIGGS  / THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIANPAGE 4 | THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN | 10 FEBRUARY 2022 WANT THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME EVERY DAY?Join our 2022-2023 student leadership team at the Student Media Center!Applications are available for the following positions:• The Daily Mississippian Editor-in-Chief• NewsWatch Ole Miss Manager• Rebel Radio ManagerRequirements:• Previous Student Media Center Experience• 2.5 GPA minimum• Full-time student statusPositions are PAID!Email studentmedia@olemiss.edu for applications or questions.Mississippi legalizes medical marijuanaMedical marijuana is legal in Mississippi after Gov. Tate Reeves signed legislation legalizing the plant for medical use on Wednesday, Feb. 3. Senate Bill 2095 — the Mississippi Medical Cannabis Act — authorizes the use of cannabis for individuals with qualifying medical issues to use marijuana as treatment. Mississippi becomes the 37th state in the union to legalize marijuana in some way.The 445-page bill codifies every inch of what Mississippi’s medical marijuana program will look like, from the transportation of marijuana to its distribution. The Mississippi State Department of Health, who will oversee the program, will begin accepting medical marijuana license applications in June.Individuals who wish to benefit from the program will have to be certified by a qualified medical practitioner after an in-person exam and acquire a registry identification card from the MSDH. Dispensaries — stores that sell cannabis — cannot be located within 1,000 feet of childcare facilities, schools or churches without special permission. Patients are authorized to purchase up to three ounces — just over 85 grams — per month.“There is no doubt that there are individuals in our state who could do significantly better if they had access to medically prescribed doses of cannabis,” Reeves wrote in a statement shared to Twitter. “There are also those who really want a recreational marijuana program that could lead to more people smoking and less people working, with all of the societal and family ills that that brings.”This signing of this legislation marks the end of a saga that stretches over a year for those who voted for Initiative 65 in November 2020. Mississippi voters overwhelmingly voiced their support at the polls for medical marijuana, but the initiative was struck down by the Mississippi Supreme Court, after justices argued the Mississippi ballot initiative process was constitutionally flawed.VIOLET JIRA thedmnews@gmail.comOn Feb. 3, Tate Reeves signed Senate Bill 2095 — the Mississippi Medical Cannabis Act — into law, legalizing medical marijuana for individuals with qualifying conditions.FILE PHOTO: KATHERINE BUTLER  / THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIANTHE DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN | 10 FEBRUARY 2022 | PAGE 538976Carryout OnlyPROUD PARTNERwith OLE MISS DINING37013Hill Country Roots to plant 2,000 trees for service dayHill Country Roots, a student-led environmental service organization, will plant 2,000 trees at the UM Field Station on Saturday with the help of hundreds of volunteers.The effort is part of the HCR’s Day of Service, which will mark the official start of the first student-run tree farm in Mississippi, according to Matt Knerr, a junior biochemistry major and current president of Hill Country Roots.Knerr said the organization began with only four members who were concerned about erosion in the Oxford community. The organization identified that erosion in Oxford was largely caused by land developing companies who clear-cut their plots, causing soil runoff and decreased water quality. This is especially significant near low-income housing areas.“HCR was formed to plant trees and advocate against this method of development, with the goal of reducing erosion and putting trees in the ground that’ll outlive all of us,” Knerr said. “HCR still has this goal at heart, but I’ve expanded it to include students and serve as a point of introduction into environmentalism.”Former HCR member Maya Kaup spoke about the importance of the organization’s founding mission in a 2020 HottyToddy.com article.“We all shared a love for trees and a concern about how many trees were being cut down for new developments,” Kaup said. “We started meeting every two weeks to discuss how we could preserve, protect and plant trees in our community.”Now, the organization has over 100 members who are dedicated to environmental learning and volunteering to improve the community.Knerr said he got involved in Hill Country Roots his freshman year after he attended an event where they gave away free saplings. He walked away with two peach trees.As the trees grew, so did his immense passion for sustainability. This sparked Knerr to begin the groundwork of a tree farm that he hopes will create a template for other schools throughout the state to replicate.“I want this to be a chance to get new students connected to sustainability and environmentalism,” Knerr said. “As president of HCR, I care about facilitating others’ passions and providing the resources and mentorship necessary to make (improvements to) Oxford and Lafayette County.”Beyond planting trees, Knerr says he wants to lead an event that people will enjoy and talk about for years to come.“HCR has plans to expand the tree farm to grow 5,000 trees over the next year and a half, all of which will be out planted into the LOU area to improve water quality, prevent erosion and put people in contact with the earth and with environmentalism,” Knerr said.Kendall McDonald, the associate director for the Office of Sustainability, is the staff advisor for the event. McDonald said this event will help regenerate and inspire members of the community, especially during the stressful times the pandemic has brought to individuals.“These trees will help generate oxygen, bioremediate pollutants, prevent erosion, provide shade to our future generations and support a healthy LOU community,” McDonald said. “Beyond this, the event will help bring community members together for a day spent in the fresh air doing something good, which we all need from time to time.”The service event will take place on Feb. 12 from 12-4 p.m. Volunteers are asked to meet at the Jackson Avenue Center at 11:15 a.m. to caravan to the UM Field Station, a few miles northeast of campus, where the trees will be planted.GRACE TEMPLE thedmnews@gmail.com Oxford Public Library: We’re here for every person When Ridgeland Mayor Gene McGee threatened to withdraw funding from the Ridgeland Public Library for providing LGBTQ+ material in January, it ignited a media fi restorm that stretched across the country and even overseas, inviting the typical criticisms of Mississippi back into media cycles. When Mississippi best selling author Author Angie Thomas tweeted a fundraiser for people to donate to the library, it invited supporters of the library to bash the state as a whole.Lori Barnes, director of the First Regional Library System, which includes the Oxford Public Library, said that local lawmakers do not have any control over what materials are accessible at the public library. Barnes said lawmakers are very supportive both fi nancially and actively and the library couldn’t ‘do what they we do’ without them.But, McGee’s threat to withhold funding remained just that, a threat. He legally could not purge all LGBTQ+ books from the public library.The story continued to circulate widely, however, what was missing from most of the headlines was an acknowledgement that the Board of Alderman in Ridgeland voted down the mayor’s actions, and that other library systems in Mississippi off er extensive catalogs of LGBTQ+ material.Barnes said the Oxford Public Library is committed to the freedom to read by providing services for all aspects of the community. There is a very diverse community in Oxford, and the library collection should refl ect that diversity.“Really one of the beautiful things about working in a library is that we’re here for every person in this community,” Laura Beth Walker, the branch manager of the Oxford Public Library, said.UM Law student CJ Winship, a native of Ridgeland, wrote a recent editorial for the Mississippi Free Press, detailing how important it was to her to be able to fi nd LGBTQ+ resources at her local library during a time of deep personal struggle.“(It) helped me realize I was not alone in my feelings and that others like me existed,” Winship, who now openly identifi es as gay, said. “I found several self-help books that helped put my mind at ease and reassure me that I was not broken.”Ally Watkins, the youth librarian of the Oxford Public Library, said there have not been any major complaints about LGBTQ+ materials in the library. However, the library has a challenge policy containing a series of steps that people who want to talk about materials can go through.“The library is more than just materials. We off er programming, resources, computers and all kinds of stuff ,” Watkins said. “We do our best to be a gathering place for the community.”See “Ridgeland mayor is an embarrassment,” Opinion, page 11.GRACE TEMPLEthedmnews@gmail.comGRAPHIC COURTESY: HILL COUNTRY ROOTSIMAGE VIA  AMAZONPAGE 6 | THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN | 10 FEBRUARY 202237015Darty in the ‘SipThis article marks the second installation of a new series highlighting the changing of the guard in Rebel football. I will be taking to the film in order to watch, breakdown and evaluate notable Ole Miss athletes who have either declared for the draft or are transferring into the program.Stat BreakdownListed H/W/P: 6’3”, 215 lbs, QBFuture Pro Comparison: Matt CorralIn a Nutshell: Jaxson Dart has flexed a powerful throwing arm which allows him to get the ball from A to B with little hesitation. Dart has shown the ability to throw with pinpoint accuracy and hit receivers in stride, at shoulder height. While he has demonstrated the ability to make every throw in the book, Dart will need to grow into his own talent and adjust to the speed of college football.StrengthsFor those who are new to the world of football scouting, a “cannon” is an industry term for a quarterback who can throw absolute rockets. Jaxson Dart has a cannon. He throws the ball with authority and intent. Against Washington State, he showcased his ability to throw balls fast, far and accurately. One particular play with 11:55 left in the second quarter stands out. Dart was on the right hash throwing a 10-yard curl to the boundary side of the field. Dart was in the shotgun and took a two-step drop before hitting his receiver on the timing route. From its release to catch, the ball probably changed altitude by a foot, if that. Dart’s throw went in a nearly perfect straight line, minimizing the time the ball spent in the air.This is beneficial for a few reasons. First and foremost, it gives the defense as little time as possible to react to the pass and make a play on the ball. This means that receivers need to gain less separation for Dart to have a legitimate target, essentially making their job easier. Secondly, it means that the receiver does not have to fight back to the ball.Usually, on curl or comeback routes, the receiver will have to fight back towards the QB in order to box out the DB and keep the throwing window open. This minimizes the yardage gained and lowers the probability of a completion. The throw was especially important given the situation, as it was third and ten with Dart throwing from about six yards deep in the end zone. However, what makes Dart a truly elite prospect is that he can not only throw with power and drive in the short game, but can also throw finesse routes downfield. Granted, being able to target Drake London makes this task a little easier, but Dart is able to make 50/50 balls turn into 70/30 balls. He does this by reading the defensive back’s body language when they are in coverage downfield and throwing the receiver away from their momentum. If the DB is over the receiver and has their hips and eyes turned upfield, Dart will throw the receiver a back shoulder pass, which is the furthest point from the defensive back and close to the receiver (this is also how you draw pass interference). If the cornerback is trailing, Dart will put air under the ball and throw the receiver a traditional deep pass, once again having the ball land so that the receiver’s body is between it and the defender.While Dart certainly tries to make plays through the air first, I would not discount his ability to run at all. Similar to Matt Corral, Dart is an opportunistic scrambler whose spread offense opens up running lanes as plays develop, or on QB draws.Dart and Corral are nearly identical on the ground, with both of them having the ability to avoid tacklers despite not having elite agility or physicality. Dart also runs with the same reckless abandon which had Ole Miss fans simultaneously cheering and cringing as Corral lowered his shoulder into safeties and linebackers with no regard for his long term health.While there is no guarantee that Kiffin will give Dart the same rushing liberties as Corral, do not fear that the dimension has been lost from the Rebel offense. In general, Dart has the moxie and swagger of a superstar. He will fit into the Ole Miss culture perfectly both on and off the field. I would also expect him to be a strong locker room presence. It is telling that Michael Trigg was willing to follow him nearly anywhere in the transfer portal.Dart also plays with his head on fire. He does not slide, and when he throws an interception he lays out like a safety to make a tackle. Although one of the most popular and greatest quarterbacks just finished his time in Oxford, Jaxson Dart is the perfect replacement candidate.WeaknessesAlthough Dart has the potential to be a dominant quarterback, he is not there yet. Most importantly, Dart needs to learn to control himself. His play-making ability is clearly there, he has shown that he can break sacks, throw on the run, hit deep balls and perform just about any other tasks asked of him. However, he needs to know his limit.Dart can sometimes get over excited at the prospect of a big play and force throws downfield or try to do too much. If we turn to the Washington State game once again, we can see a prime example of this. With 4:11 left in the third quarter, Washington State brought a five-man pressure which confused the offensive line and wound up sending a free blitzer. Dart evaded the rusher, stepped up and rolled out to his right keeping his eyes downfield before diving and throwing a Patrick Mahomes-esque pass nearly 50 yards downfield, where a defender undercut it and picked it off.These are the moments where you cut your losses and chuck the ball into the second deck. Importantly, Dart is young. This is not a problem unique to him and is certainly fixable. Dart can also let the rare throw get away from him. There are times, usually when hitting a 10-20 yard out breaking route, where Dart will misfire completely and ground the ball five yards off target. Once again, this is something that will likely come with development as he works on completing his full throwing motion and footwork on every snap.TakeawaysAs previously mentioned, Dart is the perfect successor to Matt Corral. They have similar play styles and attitudes, and both boast incredibly high ceilings as future projections. Lane Kiffin hit the nail on the head with this one. With the right supporting cast, Dart has the talent and potential to be a day one draft pick and an Ole Miss great. However, it is crucial that the rest of the offense meets him halfway.Of course, it is great to dominate the transfer portal like Lane Kiffin has, but at the end of the day it is more important to bring in steady recruiting classes. In the last three recruiting cycles, Ole Miss has brought in just two 4-star receivers who have combined for no catches in their four total years of experience. Competing in the SEC as a non-traditional powerhouse is not only difficult, but crucial to build off your own success on the recruiting trail. This year, Ole Miss finished third in the SEC, yet pulled just the 10th best recruiting class in the conference. The incoming transfers will make Ole Miss a tough matchup again next year, but most of these players will stay for one year, maybe two. Ole Miss has just secured their second straight elite talent at quarterback and is in the national spotlight as a fun program to be around. This is a golden opportunity for the program to capitalize and gain real, long term momentum.OWEN PUSTELLthedmsports@gmail.comJaxson Dart looks downfield for an open receiver during a game against UCLA on Nov. 20, 2021.PHOTO COURTESY : AMANDA CHOU  / THE DAILY TROJANTHE DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN | 10 FEBRUARY 2022 | PAGE 7OPEN LATE!

Ruffin was averaging 12.6 points, 3.4 assists and 2.3 steals per game. The week before his injury, he had been named the SEC Player of the Week.Junior guard Jarkel Joiner was Ole Miss’s leading scorer (13.6 points per game) before he suffered a back injury against Texas A&M on Jan. 11. Ruffin was forced to step up as the Rebels’ primary ball-handler and scoring option. He certainly embraced the new role and shined in the spotlight.“Daeshun was just hitting his stride and was establishing himself as one of the best point guards in the SEC,” Ole Miss Head Coach Kermit Davis said. “I feel badly for Daeshun, but I know he will attack rehab with a great maturity and will return stronger than ever next season. Our team has been very resilient all season long, and we expect no difference against a really good Florida team on Saturday.”It seems as if Ruffin can’t avoid the injury bug. In the first game of the season against New Orleans, he suffered a broken right hand that forced him to sit out for eight games.Ruffin attended Callaway High School in Jackson, where he led them to multiple district titles and state championship appearances. He was the first McDonald’s All-American signee in program history, as well as the Rebels’ highest-ranked recruit ever. The four-star prospect was ranked No. 1 in the state of Mississippi and No. 40 in the nation. Saying that this is an enormous loss for Ole Miss’s team is an understatement.With seven games remaining in the season, it’ll be interesting to see if the Rebels can find a way to be resilient.Point guard Daeshun Ruffin out for seasonUniversity of Mississippi guard Daeshun Ruffin looks up the court during a game against Kansas State.HG BIGGS  / THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIANDILLON CADERthedmsports@gmail.comThe Ole Miss Men’s Basketball team lost 62-57 in overtime to the Florida Gators in the two teams’ second matchup in as many weeks.Ole Miss let a game slip away that they probably deserved to win. They out-rebounded the Gators by 12, coming down with 44 and allowing Florida to grab just four offensive boards the entire game.The Rebels out-defended and out-worked Florida for the majority of the game. Florida shot 41% from the field, but Ole Miss’s ability to limit them to one shot per possession for most of the game all but shut down the Gator offense.The problem for the Rebels this game was shooting. Ole Miss shot just 31% from the court in a game where both teams scored only 48 points apiece in regulation.Jarkel Joiner was able to play after missing the last eight games with a back injury. Despite looking healthy on the court, he wasn’t able to find his game and finished with just seven points, knocking down only three of his ten shots.Ole Miss started out the game hot, jumping out to a nine point lead midway through the first half and eventually took the same lead into halftime. The Rebels were controlling the tempo of the game with their lockdown defense and were shooting at a serviceable rate.Florida was able to get back in the game early in the second half due to Ole Miss’s inability to make shots. The Rebels went a little over ten minutes in the second half without hitting a field goal. They scored just one point in the first ten minutes and would eventually score just 18 in the entire half.Despite the Rebels’ poor shooting, they were still out-rebounding the Gators and outworking them on the defensive end. Both teams went through several long periods of time without scoring, making for one of the sloppiest games of the year so far.Ole Miss’s best play was to just shoot it and go get it as second-chance points provided for a large portion of the offense in the second half.With the game tied at 48, Ole Miss had the ball with 29 seconds left but was unable to capitalize on the opportunity.In overtime, the Rebels missed  critical free throws and turned the ball over when they desperately needed a basket. Florida’s Colin Castleton got hot in overtime and almost single-handedly secured the win for the Gators.Castleton led the way in scoring for the Gators with his 17 point, seven-rebound performance. Tye Fagan led the Rebels in scoring with 15 points but committed eight costly turnovers.Ole Miss falls to 12-11 and 3-7 in conference play. They’re a team that shows a lot of heart each and every game as they continue to fight despite battling so much turmoil with injuries and a number of disappointing losses.The road won’t get any easier for the Rebels as it was announced earlier in the week that Daeshun Ruffin would miss the rest of the season with a torn ACL.Men’s basketball falls to Florida in overtime University of Mississippi guard Austin Crowley drives past a Kansas State opponent during a game on Jan. 29.HG BIGGS / THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIANPAGE 8 | THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN | 10 FEBRUARY 2022BOOK YOUR NEXT EVENT WITH US!Please Drink Responsibly, Must be 21 to Enter and DrinkSwapsDate PartiesParents WeekendsWeddings...and More!38962Inquiries: email abby@lamaryard.comState Health InsuranceAssistance ProgramSHIPMississippi’s State Health Insurance Assistance Program Contact SHIPor contact your local Area Agency on Aging.3900037014The 2022 Winter Olympics are officially underway in Beijing despite the increase of uneasiness from surrounding nations.So, why is this year’s Olympic Games controversial?It is due to the accusations towards China’s authoritarian government regarding human rights and genocide. Authorities in China have reportedly detained over a million Muslims in the country’s westernmost province, Xinjiang.According to a report published by the Human Rights Watch last year, the Chinese government committed crimes against humanity that included torture, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and separation of families against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims.Some of the Ole Miss community offered to share their thoughts regarding if they would still watch the Olympics with all of the controversy going around. Here’s what they had to say:“I would still watch it because the athletes deserve to be seen,” sophomore exercise science major Mina Tran said. “They didn’t do anything related to China. They’re just there to compete.”Viewership in the US alone is down 48% since the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. However, students in Oxford are still tuning in.“I would still watch because I love watching the U.S. in the Olympics, but I think the athletes should use their platform in the Olympics to say something about the controversy,” freshman general business major Eliza Chatfield said.Muslim activists are calling this year’s Olympics “The Genocide Games.” Activists believe that the Chinese government will use the Olympics to legitimize itself and create a distraction from the abuses.Back in December, the United States, along with other nations such as Canada, Denmark and the United Kingdom, announced a diplomatic boycott — meaning government officials will not be attending the Olympic Games — to protest the abuses created by the Chinese government regarding human rights.While there is a diplomatic boycott, there are no athletes who have skipped the games in acts of protest.“The Olympics are a way for countries to celebrate their culture and accomplishments,” junior journalism major Gia Witt said. “If anything, it’s a good thing that these games have brought these controversies to light because otherwise, they might not have gotten enough coverage.”Another issue at hand for China is on how they can prevent COVID-19 from affecting the Olympics.Chinese authorities have created an extensive branch of bubbles, officially known as the “closed loop,” which separates the Olympic Games from the city. Athletes will be tested daily and are forced to travel in dedicated vehicles, even if a place is nearby.A bubble is a term that sports fans should be all too familiar with. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the NBA created a bubble at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando.The bubble proved to be effective because there were zero reported COVID-19 cases. This is mainly due to the fact that there weren’t any fans in attendance and the players and coaches weren’t allowed to leave the property.China hopes to have similar success while hosting the 2022 Beijing Games this year.This year’s Olympics acts as a national achievement for China because the city of Beijing will become the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics. It’s also the first time China is hosting a global event since the COVID-19 outbreak when they were forced to close down their borders two years ago.UM students on Olympic controversyA man watches a rebroadcast of the opening ceremony at the 2022 Winter Olympics.PHOTO COURTESY: JAE C.

However, Shakira Austin and Angel Baker both had memorable nights, reaching the 1,500-career point mark.Despite scoring the first bucket of the game, the Rebels got off to a slow start. Following the first points scored, the Tigers went on an 8-0 run. Ole Miss responded with some lockdown defense and a 7-0 run of their own, retaking the lead. In a back and forth affair, LSU then went on a 6-0 run to reclaim the lead and end the first quarter.The Rebels struggled with scoring throughout the second quarter until they sparked a 6-0 run, which cut LSU’s lead to 27-23 heading into the locker room.The Rebels came out hot offensively in the second half, bringing the score to 27 even. However, consecutive turnovers for Ole Miss led to the Tigers taking an 11 point lead.The Rebels never gave up, with an 8-0 run bringing them within 4 points with under 60 seconds left in the contest. The Tigers made the necessary free throws to ultimately pull out the 68-64 road win.After the game, head coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin was asked about the team’s performance over the stretch of four ranked opponents in five games.“Would we like to win those games right now? I mean, absolutely. You’re at home, you have a little crowd. You want to try and win those games when you can. But we’re going to continue to collect and learn. Because we have a lot more basketball to go, and I’m not talking about just regular season…I think it’s going to help us make a strong run in the SEC tournament,” Coach Yo said. “It’s like you keep taking these tests, you keep taking tests, you keep taking tests. You’re learning.”The Rebels documented a 40% field goal percentage compared to the Tigers 37.3%. However, the Rebels went just 2 for 12 on threes, shooting a mere 16.7% from beyond the arc.Ole Miss was led by Baker with 20 points, followed by Austin with 11 and Lashonda Monk with 10. Madison Scott made a huge impact on the boards, coming out with a season-high 15 rebounds. The Ole Miss bench was also a difference-maker tonight, recording 32 of the 64 points.The Rebels will head to Starkville for their next battle against rival Mississippi State on Sunday (Feb. 13) at 3 p.m. CT.

Despite her passing in 1977, folk artist Theora Hamblett’s work remains a vital touchstone in the state’s artistic development.Born in Paris, Mississippi, in 1895, Hamblett composed hundreds of works, illustrating the internal, the external and the existential. These paintings highlighted her childhood memories, the greater rural Mississippi landscape and the vast wonder of her religious dreams and visions — the main subject of the museum showcase, titled: “Theora Hamblett: Holy Symbols.” In 1954, following an accident, Hamblett broke her hip and was forced to undergo surgery, relegated to a hospital setting for many weeks. With this life-altering event serving as the catalyst, she spent the remainder of her days replicating the spiritual symbols that flooded her consciousness, prolifically churning out a varied and extensive collection of paintings, mosaics and fabric works, all of which personified her religious faith, and all of which are featured in the University Museum exhibit.The exhibit’s curation was led by Museum Collections Project Assistant Grace Moorman, who researched and selected the works, designed the layout and installed the exhibit.“This show was designed around the symbols that Hamblett saw in her religious dreams and visions,” Moorman said. “Along with highlighting the symbols themselves, I wanted to really show how Hamblett worked in a variety of media. She didn’t just paint. She explored different ways to portray these symbols — some of which you might recognize if you were raised in a Christian faith and others that are specific to her and interpreted by her.”While Hamblett maintained an avid, lifelong interest in learning about the arts, her adolescent focuses were primarily her faith and teaching the gospel, among other subjects, by working as a schoolteacher in her hometown during the early 20th century. Following her mother’s passing in 1939, to whom she had become a permanent caretaker for, Hamblett migrated toward Oxford, where she simultaneously worked as a seamstress and the head of a boarding house. Through these invaluable experiences, Hamblett learned of the recently established Department of Art at the University of Mississippi, enrolling in an evening painting class, and transforming her passing interest into an evergreen vocation.Despite her late career start, “Holy Symbols” represents the work of a seasoned prodigy. The exhibit provides a unique glimpse into the latter half of her artistic career, not only through the works themselves, but also through their explanatory supplements.“The text that accompanies the exhibit is mostly from two places. Lucy Turnbull, a former director of the University Museum, wrote beautifully about Hamblett’s symbol work in her 1984 exhibition catalog essay ‘O Look! Heaven is Coming to Earth: Dreams and Visions of Theora Hamblett.’ Other text comes from Hamblett herself,” Moorman said.“It was very important to her that her visions not be misinterpreted, and as a result, she provided a written explanation of many of them.”Each work feels evocative of a collective memory, often a childhood memory, as personified in “Butterfly with Exploded Wing” (1959), yet remains complex in their greater existential ties. Some works more directly represent religious iconography, such as images of the Holy Trinity, the Creator’s Star and the Greek cross. These symbols are artfully reiterated throughout the collection and despite their iconic-nature, remain highly personal to Hamblett.When Hamblett bequeathed the “Holy Symbols” collection to the University of Mississippi, the museum not only became the recipient of the largest single collection of her work, but was also given explicit instruction that the works be given priority over all her other works in exhibition, conservation and scholarly study. Decades later, her wish has come true, as the “Holy Symbols” collection becomes available for a whole new generation to experience.“I am just so happy to have been able to facilitate this iteration of our permanent Theora Hamblett exhibition and to be able to continue to share her wide variety of work with the public” Moorman said.“Theora Hamblett: Holy Symbols” is on view at the University Museum this spring. Additional information on the artist and exhibit can be found on the University Museum website.University Museum highlights the artwork of Theora HamblettPHOTO COURTESY: THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MUSEUM ILLUSTRATION: VANESSA CLARK  / THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIANRidgeland mayor is an embarrassment“Butterfl y with Exploded Wing”THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIAN | 10 FEBRUARY 2022 | PAGE 11OPINIONILLUSTRATION: VANESSA CLARK  / THE DAILY MISSISSIPPIANRidgeland mayor is an embarrassmentMove over “Fahrenheit 451,” a new dystopia is in town. People of all ages have been captured by the dystopian literature that fills bookstores and libraries, but most have never believed that such things would come true in the United States. After all, this country was founded on individual freedoms and rights. However, a Mississippi mayor is here to try to prove that belief wrong. Earlier this year, Mayor Gene McGee of Ridgeland proposed to withhold funding to the public library until it purges every LGBTQ+ book off its shelves. This type of censorship, solely based on McGee’s personal beliefs, would only help create an uneducated community, as it is a person’s personal freedom to educate themselves on whatever topic they choose.News outlets big and small have picked up on the story that a Mississippi mayor is attempting to withhold $110,000 from a public library until all LGBTQ+ books have been discarded. As this news spreads, the image of bigotry and hate is painted over the entirety of the state of Mississippi. McGee has publicly stated that attempting to withhold this funding to the public library comes from his personal Christian beliefs, and that he “only serves the great Lord” when it comes to this decision. This directly goes against the U.S. Constitution, which requires the separation of church and state. The fact that McGee practically admitted that he, a government figure, is willing to go against the Constitution based on his own bigoted values proves how he should not be working in the government.The good news, however, is that the Mississippi community is not standing for this, along with the Board of Aldermen who voted down McGee’s proposal. Almost 2,000 people have already donated over $87,000 to the library, and hopefully, more donations will come in as time goes on. One of the main groups that have helped raise this amount of money is, believe it or not, furries. The furry community found out about the issue in Mississippi and, using Twitter to spread the message, organized to support the fundraiser.On top of raising money, many have spoken out against the blatant attempt at censorship. Ole Miss hosted a brown bag “Religion for Lunch” talk Feb. 1, where members of the UM community discussed McGee’s decision. This decision might just backfire on him, as now more and more people are talking about and showing support for LGBTQ+ issues.The idea that a public authority figure is actively trying to censor a basic topic within society is disgusting. Taking away LGBTQ+ imagery can be disconcerting to youth, as only seeing heterosexual couples portrayed in literature can make some youth feel ostracized. Additionally, it takes away educational literature people might need in order to create a well-informed opinion. Many Ole Miss students come from Ridgeland, and taking away a resource that these students can use to educate themselves will only hurt the student body as a whole. Censorship of this magnitude should not be tolerated, and we as Mississippi residents need to protect our freedom.Willow Crosby is a sophomore majoring in accounting from Tupelo.Opinion Policies:Columns do not represent the views of The University of Mississippi or The Daily Mississippian.
