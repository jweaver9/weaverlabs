And it really did take a com-munity of brave and open-minded people to bring this book into existence. Thelengthy process of creation has brought home the conviction that there really issomething resembling an international, interdisciplinary academic community.And despite popular belief, this community is rather welcoming of new waysof ‘doing publishing’. Though this edited volume has some unique qualities –containing essays by only three authors, and incorporating discussions betweenthe authors into the structure of the book itself – from its first conception, theproject has seen a unique level of enthusiasm from a wide variety of people. Andwithout this enthusiasm, it would have been impossible to realise our ambitionsin the current format.First, of course, there is the Progressive Connexions team, led by Rob Fisher.The authors met at a conference on Sexual and Gender-based Violence organisedon the brink of the pandemic by the marvellous ProCon team consisting of TeresaCutler-Broyles, Lorraine Rumson and Elif Çakmak. In this same context, specialthanks should go to Kristine Seitz, the leader of this event, who, with her warmand thoughtful attitude, managed to create a safe space where deeply impressiveconversations about these painful topics could be had. She also served as anadvisor to this book, making suggestions related to inclusive terminology thathave proven to be extremely valuable.Second, there is our publisher: Emerald. Not only did they create the gorgeousbook cover that makes this volume a work of art; our Emerald team – KatyMathers, Lydia Cutmore, Sumitha Selvamani and Ramya Murali – were kind,generous and knowledgeable supporters throughout the entire process. They weregenerous with their time, but also generous in putting this book forward forselection in the Knowledge Unlatched programme, which is an amazing organi-sation that has ended up allowing us to publish the book Open Access. For that,Knowledge Unlatched and all the libraries that have pledged funds deserve notonly our acknowledgement but also our sincerest thanks.This page intentionally left blankIntroduction: Gender-Based Violence, theLaw, and SocietyM. Susanne SchotanusThis is not an easy book. It’s not an easy book to read, and – for both similar anddiverging reasons – not an easy book to write an introduction to. The reason whyit is not easy to read is the oftentimes heart-wrenching stories that are at the heartof these authors’ well-researched, theoretical arguments. From the personal abuseexperienced by women on the Post-Partition Indian Subcontinent, through to thecontinuing failings of the national legal systems in dealing with cases of rape;from the way the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the already precariouspositions experienced by sex workers in Japan, to the microaggressions sufferedby gay man of Indian descent in South Africa – the topic of gender-based violenceis rich in narratives of life-destroying (mental) health-affecting and heart-breakingeveryday realities. Though it is essential we talk about and seek solutions to theserealities, something the authors in this volume do to an admirable degree, thelevels of pain captured in this volume do not make for light reading.As you’ll no doubt understand, the writing of an introduction to such a volumecomes with its own specific set of challenges. The first of these challenges isgeographical in nature. When we first conceived of this volume, it was thecombination of narratives from countries that aren’t usually represented in vol-umes produced by British and American publishing houses that got us excited.What I did not sufficiently reflect on at that point was the fact that I, a white,European woman, would be writing this introduction, which puts me in a ratherawkward position. I’m very much aware of the privilege my place of birth hasafforded me. To have my name on this book, then, and to present these chaptersto you, the reader, opens me up to a wide range of potential critiques – fromorientalism (in my holding up stories from these countries as quaint, differentconceptions of familiar experiences) to playing the role of white saviour (in mypresenting this volume as seeking solutions to the heart-breaking realities ana-lysed in the chapters). I have no defence against these critiques, other than to say:I am aware of the dangers and pitfalls and have aimed to remain vigilant againstGender Violence, the Law, and Society, 1–9Copyright © 2022 M.

What’s more: I do not seek to speak onbehalf of groups that have traditionally been silenced, nor do I see that as my taskin this introduction. Rather, I mean to introduce the analyses presented by thesecommendable authors into the larger, global debates on the topic of gender-basedviolence. Though in the grand scheme of things good intentions do not accountfor much, I hope that here they will be enough so you will allow me to introducethe amazing work done by the three authors who’ve composed the followingchapters.A second challenge is the breadth of both the topic and experiences ofgender-based violence, as the table of contents for this volume will already makeclear. As a conceptual researcher, I am used to selecting a concept with both theflexibility and strength to – like an elastic band – bundle together the phenomena Iwant to touch on, and to then trace the historical meaning and usage of thisconcept through different traditions to come to a comprehensive, interdisciplinarytheoretical framework that I can present as the context in which to read the work.For this book, however, I’ve struggled to find those concepts that could tie thewildly diverging topics together into one logical, cohesive whole. Though they areall relevant, neither my own holy trinity of ‘power, agency and consent’, nor theconcepts offered in this book’s title, appeared to do justice to the wide variety ofpressing issues touched on by the authors. We’re currently seeing an intensity ofdiscussion on sexual assault that we have not seen since the feminist sex wars inthe early 1980s, due to the brave people who, inspired by the #MeToo movement,have broken the previously imposed silence to share their personal experiences.Their testimonies of personal abuse and assault are as varied as they are, they areimportant and need to be heard. However, as the chapters in this book show,sexual abuse is only one way in which gender-based violence is experienced on adaily basis. I finally came to realise that this variety and plurality – the impos-sibility of capturing the context in a single concept – might actually be exactly thevalue of this book. Consequently, rather than presenting you with the history ofthe concept of gender-based violence, and the academic scholarship done on thetopic, I’d like to use this introduction to actually introduce this book, rather thanit’s context. For the theoretical frameworks, I’d like to refer to you to thecomprehensive contextualising sections of each individual chapter.Each chapter in this volume explores the ways in which systems of power,individual gender identities, and cultural norms and practices work together tocreate and sustain the damaging experiences covered. But what makes this acomprehensive volume, rather than a collection of essays, is not the limited scopethat characterises most edited volumes. Instead, what the authors have managedto do is to make the case for a pluralistic understanding of gender-based violence.The issues they discuss are explored on different (institutional) levels such aspolitics, law, economic status, (former) class and caste systems, media, subcultureand the family. Though books could be, and have been, dedicated togender-based violence on each of these levels, in this book they are not consideredseparately but rather in their interweaving and dynamic relationships.The same is true for the methodologies employed and therefore the disciplineswith which this book would be associated. Each chapter in this book can stand on2 M. Susanne Schotanusits own, due to the exemplary rigour of the authors’ work. Nidhi Shrivastavaexpertly blends her analysis of Hindi film and TV shows with the historicalrealities that their scenes reflect. Gavan Patrick Gray has managed to makeJapanese academic, political and activist discourses not only available to thewider audience that this book aims to cater to but also to do this in a particularlyrich, informed, critical and sensitive way. Deepesh Dayal’s analysis of (online)magazines and interviews with gay men in South Africa make, to paraphrase apopular feminist slogan, the personal political and the political personal. How-ever, it is where the insights derived from the different disciplines come together –in the transcripts of the authors’ discussions, which form the introductions to eachof the three sections of this book – that it becomes clear how only an interna-tional, interdisciplinary, intersectional and diverse understanding of gender-basedviolence is equipped to accurately explore and reflect the multifaceted livedrealities of those affected.It’s hard to come up with a satisfying definition of gender-based violence thatcan bring all these different strands together. Therefore, in this book,gender-based violence is understood in its broadest interpretation: any type ofviolence, whether physical, economical, social or psychological, that is perpe-trated against a person because of their gender. Which, of course, brings us to thequestion how to understand gender. Again, any simple definition will necessarilyfall short. However, despite the recent development of alternate ways of thinkingabout gender, in this book, only cases of violence directed at people who identifyas either male or female are explored. Gender, here, pertains to those ideas,assumptions and expectations that relate to the male and female identities. Pleasenote that the exclusions of violence inflicted upon people who don’t identify aseither male or female is not the result of any political or ideological decision.Rather, it is the unintended result of our decision to emphasise and explore thedifferent forms of violence that are inflicted upon people, instead of exploring thedifferent ways in which people of different genders become victim-survivors ofsuch violence.Gender-Based ViolenceThe first section delves into the concept of gendered violence in more detail. Intheir introduction to this section, the authors discuss the increasingly commonunderstanding that societies are becoming less violent. Though they acknowledgethat progress has been made on many fronts, an understanding of violencebeyond the physical dimension shows that utopia has not yet been achieved. Theauthors discuss overt violence mostly in terms of precarity: the precarious cir-cumstances in which many women, sex workers and homosexuals find themselves.These people’s positions in society are accompanied by feelings of learned shameas well as limited access to power, which makes them particularly vulnerable tovarious types of abuse. However, it is these systems themselves, the structures thatproduce this lack of power and induce shame, which the authors identify asthemselves violent. Commodified violence, microaggressions and shaming intoIntroduction 3suicide may be less graphic than sexual and physical abuse, but are no less violent– as is further explored in the individual chapters of this section.Nidhi Shrivastava’s first chapter is entitled ‘Genocidal Violence, Biopolitics,and Treatment of Abducted and Raped Women in the Aftermath of 1947Partition’. In it, she discusses what she calls a ‘dark chapter’ in India’s past. Whenin 1947 the Indian Subcontinent was divided into India, West Pakistan and EastPakistan (current Bangladesh), it was decided that this Partition would take placebased on religion: Pakistan would house people of Muslim faiths, whereas Indiawould be the home to non-Muslims. As a result, mass migrations and violentclashes took place, costing an estimated 1 million people their lives. However,only in the past decade have scholars come to realise that in the midst of thischaos and unacknowledged genocide, an estimated 75.000 women were abducted,forced to marry their abductors and bear children. In their attempts to redressthese traumatic events, the Pakistani and Indian governments spent the yearsbetween 1948 and 1957 tracking down these abducted women and returning themto their ‘native communities’. However, these women were not consulted. Rather,if a woman was married to a man of a different faith, it was assumed she had beenabducted and she was transported to underfunded camps where she could behoused in terrible conditions before being returned to her original family. Herfamily members, however, often perceived her as a dishonour on the family nameand had responses ranging from turning her away to asking or forcing her tocommit suicide. In her impressive, bold chapter, Shrivastava explores the differentlayers of violence and trauma that these women experienced at different hands, aswell as the relationships of these various types of violence to biopolitics, genocideand traditional gender roles.Whereas the most familiar attitudes towards sex work fall into one of twocamps – either as inherently violent or a legitimate form of enterprise – in thesecond chapter, ‘The Commodification of Sex in Modern Japan: Outdated Atti-tudes and Overdue Reforms’, Gavan Patrick Gray shows that in Japan the debateon legalising the sex industry is quite different. Here, the negative view of theindustry also contains the idea that the existence of the industry is proof of afailure to adhere to Western (modern) norms, while positive attitudes contain theidea that the industry contributes to social harmony and sexual health. Still,though both views make their arguments on collective, societal levels, the politicalstatus of the sex industry in Japan is precarious. Prostitution is not legal, thoughthe sex industry is condoned. In these dynamics, Gray identifies ‘symbolicviolence’: a form of domination embedded in everyday actions that prevents itsvictims from expressing grievance, due to acceptance that the system that harmsthem is regarded as natural, unchangeable, or in some ways beneficial. Afterdiscussing in detail the public, legal and political attitudes towards the sexindustry, Gray shows that the failure of current systems in offering support to sexworkers became especially clear at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In asection entitled ‘Double Standards and Inadequate Support Systems’, he notesthat sex workers were excluded from a system established to support parents whowere forced to leave their work due to school closures, and shows how this is onlya symptom of the larger failing of the system. He argues that commodified4 M. Susanne Schotanusviolence and symbolic violence are engrained in this system, and need to beproperly addressed on political, legal and societal levels.A third form of often-overlooked violence based on gender is discussed byDeepesh Nirmaldas Dayal in the third chapter: ‘Sexual Orientation Micro-aggressions in South Africa’. Though people with LGBT1 identities have heldconstitutional protection from discrimination in South Africa since 2006, Dayalidentifies a plethora of covert forms of violence, called microaggressions, that arestill very prevalent within this country. Sexual orientation microaggressions occurin several forms, and are used to mock, demean and negate the lived experiencesof LGBTQ1 people. In this chapter, the author looks at microaggressions spe-cifically in the context of LGBTQ1 people of Indian descent who live in SouthAfrica. Due to stigmatisation within Indian communities, as well as their status asethnic minorities in a society that is working to overcome the effects of Apartheid,these people experience additional layers of microaggressions, adding up to avolatile mix of psychological challenges. The microaggressions they experiencelead to internalised homophobia, shame and highly compartmentalised andisolating ways of living. By analysing three types of microaggressions – micro-assaults, microinsults and microinvalidations – through excerpts from interviewswith South African Indian gay men and magazines that cater to them, Dayalshows the violent nature of these covert forms of discrimination, and argues thatthey have the potential of harming their recipients just like physical/overtviolence. Therefore, they should be included in any discussion of violence,whether in an academic, legal, therapeutic or cultural context.Gender-Based Violence and the LawIn the second section, the authors focus on the way gender-based violence isaddressed within each country’s legal systems. The discussion that introduces thissection explores how – even though rape and sexual assault are illegal in eachcountry discussed – both the nature and cultural perceptions of the systems thatshould execute this legal protection fail to live up to their promises. Factors suchas access to financial resources; class, caste and racial backgrounds; and adher-ence to gender expectations are shown to still play a large role in the legal tra-jectories following official reports of sexual assault – and to determine to a largeextent whether the perpetrator will be convicted and punished for their crime.However, the authors also discuss factors that prevent victim-survivors fromreporting these experience in the first place: a lack of trust in the system, and thefear that the legal process will be as violent as the initial crime. Finally, theauthors touch on the importance of finding an appropriate terminology whenspeaking about gender, sexual orientation and the violent crimes committed inresponse to them. These discussions all serve to introduce the three individualchapters which deal with issues of gender-based violence in relation to the legalsystem.In Chapter 4, ‘The Insidious Culture of Fear in Indian Courts’, NidhiShrivastava explores cases of rape, both real and fictional, to show the problemsIntroduction 5inherent in India’s current legal system when it comes to rape and sexual violence.Shrivastava argues that the current system does not support the rapevictim-survivor, rendering her helpless and re-traumatising her in the process. TheHindi movies she analyses criticise and problematise the current systems, exposingthe widespread and harmful practice of judging the victim based on her previoussexual history and reputation, as well as the role access to financial resources playsin a victim-survivor’s ability to seek justice. What’s more, even where the systemsthemselves are reformed, there’s a lack of commitment to and enforcement ofthese systems due to socio-political and cultural structures that serve to inducefear, humiliation and shame in the would-be accuser. A 1980s cult classic theauthor analyses appears to suggest that the only way a victim-survivor of rape cangain justice is by seeking it on her own terms, even if that means breaking the law.Other films Shrivastava explores show the different ways in which women aresilenced throughout the process, as well as highlighting the role that class andcaste still play in determining the victim-survivors’ chances of success. By drawinglinks to the 2013 Amendments to rape laws in India, as well as real-world rapecases, she takes her conclusions out of the realm of fiction to make a strong casefor more significant reforms, to allow rape victim-survivors to finally get thejustice they deserve.In Chapter 5, Gavan Patrick Gray discusses ‘Legal Responses to SexualViolence in Japan: First Steps in a Lengthy Process of Rehabilitation’. ThoughJapan has a strict judicial system that has resulted in low crime rates, when itcomes to sexual violence the picture is quite different. Gray locates the problem inthe slow changes Japanese culture has seen in its change of perceptions of genderidentities. Though in 2017 Japan made the first major changes to its penal code onsex crimes in more than 110 years, this has by no means eradicated the weaknessesin the legal system when it comes to punishing perpetrators of rape. Between thestatute of limitations on rape and sexual assault, and gaps in legal definitions ofterms such as voyeurism, some issues can be addressed with changes to the lawsthemselves. However, as Gray points out, there are other changes necessary thatare related less to the laws themselves, and more to how they are interpreted andexecuted. Though the Japanese system generates circumstances similar to thosedescribed in the case of India – meaning that only an estimated 10% of instancesof sexual violence are reported – Gray shows that the major hurdles preventingperpetrators from conviction, even if they are identified, are victim hesitancy andthe strongly developed ‘settlement industry’. By presenting the current situation,highlighting barriers and issues within both the current legal system and culture,and drawing from activist discourses to make suggestions for reform, this chapterpresents a nuanced picture of the gaps and possibilities of Japan’s justice systemon its own terms.In 1994, South Africa was reborn as a democracy, promising freedom andequality for all citizens. However, Deepesh Dayal shows in this sixth chapter,‘The Paradox of Constitutional Protection and Prejudice Experienced byLGBTQ1 People’ that though constitutionally the freedoms of people withLGBTQ1 identities are protected, this does not mean they experience thefreedom and equality promised. He looks specifically at the category of violence6 M. Susanne Schotanuscalled ‘hate crimes’, showing that about 7% of the South African population fearsbeing the recipient of hate crimes, and that simultaneously peoples’ faith in thejustice system is in sharp decline. People believe there’s a lot of corruption in thecourts, sentences passed are too lenient, and the system is too slow to be efficient.What’s more, similar to what was reported in the preceding two chapters, peoplewho are the victims of hate crimes fear that they will receive secondary victim-isation by the system itself if they choose to file a report. It is here that the conceptof intersectionality is first introduced: though these figures are harrowing whenrelated to the South African population, LGBTQ1 people of Indian descentexperience particularly high rates of verbal abuse, threats of physical violence,sexual assault and abuse by family members. By exploring all these intersectingfactors, Deepesh Dayal explores and brings to light the particular challenges thatstill exist, in a country that was one of the first to constitutionally protect therights of its LGBTQ1 citizens.Gender-Based Violence and CultureIn their introduction to the third section, the authors explain the social and cul-tural factors that shape the form of, and attitudes to, gender-based and sexualviolence. They point out that though in the EU and US discussions on, andanalyses of, these types of violence are becoming more commonplace and easy toexamine, in many areas of the world there are regional or national perspectivesthat problematize these practices. Factors like shame, family honour and col-lective identity perceptions place additional burdens and stress on victim-survivors that are not taken into account in standard Western approaches tothese issues. The cases analysed by all three authors in their individual chapters inthis section specifically look at factors that silence victim-survivors, and pressurethem to not speak up. As the lack of reporting of crimes is one of the mainbarriers in any statistical analysis on the topic, the deeper understandings of theseprocesses of silencing form a major contribution to scholarship on gender-basedand sexual violence. What’s more, the authors discuss different ways in whichthese cultural barriers might be removed: through media, education or a com-bination of both. Finally, the authors end on a discussion of their own role withinthese processes.In Chapter 7, ‘Rape and the Prevalent Culture of Silence in India’, NidhiShrivastava discusses the factors that determine whose rape will be discussed anddebated, and which will be forgotten. Because of caste, class, gender, honour andshame, only certain narratives are privileged in mainstream media and popularculture. The culture of silence Shrivastava discusses, however, pertains to morethan just media: as she already indicated in her previous chapters, factors such ashonour and shame often cause the victim-survivors’ own families to pressure theminto silence – especially when the perpetrator of violence is one of their familymembers. After outlining these issues, Shrivastava goes on to analyse two mediarepresentations that aim to break the culturally imposed silence. These mediatexts show that child sexual abuse and gender-based violence are not onlyIntroduction 7committed by the poor, lower classes but take place in both the public and privatespheres of the elite and upper middle classes as well. Shrivastava teases out thosethreads in the texts that relate to the culture of silence that protects the upper-classperpetrators and allows them to repeatedly commit their crimes unpunished.Though in preceding chapters on sexual assault the roles of female gendernorms have been discussed, in Chapter 8, ‘Japanese Gender Norms and theirImpact on Male Attitudes Towards Women’, Gavan Patrick Gray dives into themale gender norms that to a large extent determine gender relations in Japan.Gray shows how the male gender stereotype of the industrious, productive anddistant breadwinner has created an emotional crisis among many Japanese men.The gender expectations dissuade these men from forming meaningful intimaterelationships with their families and cause a range of sometimes psychologicallyharmful responses: from fixating upon unthreatening juvenile women to rejectingromantic entanglement of any kind. In his chapter, Gray gives a brief overview ofthe history of gender relations in Japan, before diving into these two differentresponses to the lack of companionship experienced by these men due to thegender stereotypes. Then, he explores in more detail the ikumen concept – which isused to refer to men who are attractive to women because they take an active rolein raising children – and has become part of an ongoing project by the Ministry ofHealth, Labour and Welfare to promote gender equality in the home. Thoughmany Japanese men are emotionally mature and do not suffer from the issues firstexplored, the outlier cases are so harmful and widespread that they help illumi-nate some of the deeper problems with Japan’s gender norms. As gender normsare often analysed in the context of harm to women, this chapter will proveessential for both the debates on gender and on gender-based violence, as thesemale gender stereotypes have the ability to harm everyone involved.Deepesh Dayal’s Chapter 9, ‘Intersectional Influences on Sexual OrientationMicroaggressions’, similarly explores the gender stereotypes that contribute toviolence – in this chapter in the specific form of microaggressions – but does so inan intersectional framework. He builds this framework out of the seeminglydisparate layers of class, gender, ethnicity and minority cultures which were alladdressed to some extent in preceding chapters, to explore the specific experiencestestified to by homosexual men of Indian descent in South Africa. Where on anational level LGBT identities are often seen as un-South African and a Westernimport, within the Indian communities, in particular, there’s an added layer ofhegemonic male gender expectations – often emphasised and exacerbated byBollywood movies – which are perceived to preclude gay male identities.Effeminate male behaviour is conflated with gay sexual orientation, meaning thatoften boys are punished and bullied for ‘being gay’ even before they themselvesare aware of their sexual identity. What’s more, as a result of Apartheid, Indiancommunities in South Africa are particularly tight-knit and collectivist, meaningthere is a strong level of social control. Add to this the influence of religion in thecountry, and what you find is a volatile, intersectional mix of factors that supportand sustain the use of microaggressions as a response to LGBT identities.Combined, these chapters show the many forms gender-based violence cantake, specifically in the collectivist communities that are often overlooked in8 M. Susanne Schotanusscholarship on the subject. Whether violence is committed through rape orharmful gender stereotypes; by individuals or supposedly protective systems; theeffects of this violence can traumatise generations. By analysing their case studiesin their respective national and cultural contexts, the authors manage to outlinethe field of issues related to gendered violence on a previously unimagined scalewhile remaining cognizant of the complicated networks of influences that prob-lematise any simple (Western) solution to these issues. Combining an unprece-dented scope with great depth and specificity, this volume shows through practicethe value and potential of an international, interdisciplinary and intersectionalapproach to the topic of gendered violence.Introduction 9This page intentionally left blankGender-Based ViolenceThis page intentionally left blankSection I: Gender-Based ViolenceGavan Patrick Gray, Nidhi Shrivastavaand Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalAbstractThis chapter is a transcript of an open-ended discussion that occurredbetween the authors when they met to discuss the subject matter of the firstsection of the book, which focuses on areas where serious ongoing problemsof gender violence are receiving insufficient attention. The discussion tookplace after preliminary drafts had been completed and the authors share theirthoughts on the subjects they will each discuss in more detail in the followingchapters – including the cultural representation of historical gender violencein India, the treatment of women in Japan’s sex industry and attitudestowards LGBTQ1 groups in South Africa.Keywords: Gender violence; Japan; India; South Africa; gender equality;precarityGray: I think we can agree that this is a very broad topic and we are only likely totouch on some specific and quite focused areas of it in the following chapters. Inthis space though, we have a little more freedom to explore elements of theencompassing theme. If I can begin, I would like to ask if either of you have readSteven Pinker’s Better Angels of our Nature? He argues that human civilisationhas been steadily growing less violent and that we are becoming, and will continueto become, more civilised, including an increase in empathy and protection ofvarious rights. I wonder if you feel that gender violence is in decline?Personally, I think it’s clear that there are significant improvements over pastsocial norms. However, I have a deep thread of cynicism about political systemsthat always makes me fear the dystopian potential of civilisational change, theGender Violence, the Law, and Society, 13–21Copyright © 2022 Gavan Patrick Gray, Nidhi Shrivastava and Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

A decrease in overallviolence that doesn’t safeguard the fundamental rights of all people could beportrayed as a utopia for the significant majority that it benefits. However, interms of gender violence, I have concerns that satisfaction with an overallimprovement in well-being for the majority might make it easier for someminority groups to be consigned to potential abuse in the shadows of society. Thisis why I think it is so important to examine the marginalised and minority groupsas they are the ones that are most in danger of being overlooked by people whomight think that gender violence is decreasing and not realise that there are thosewho have been passed by and remain trapped in institutionalised systems ofoppression, violence or exploitation.Dayal: I agree Gavan, this section is quite broad and there are many differentavenues that can be debated. Looking at South Africa, the 1994 elections sawcitizens from all racial groups help to give birth to a new democracy that rep-resented freedom, equality, social justice and opportunities for all. However, twodecades later a paradox exists where, despite numerous new policies and legis-lation guaranteeing civil and political rights, significant levels of crime, corruptionand human rights violations still plague the country. Despite the strong evidencefor this, some people are in denial and claim that these high levels of crime andinequality are normal and on par with other countries. The fear of crime thatexists is persistent and debilitating and hate crimes are a particular problem,including those that focus on race, nationality and sexuality. In 2016, a surveyfound that more than seven percent of South Africans have a fear of being tar-geted by hate crimes. There have been some recent victories though, where per-petrators faced legal punishments and in 2018 new hate crimes legislation focusingon the crimes against LGBTQ1 people was presented for passage. These newlaws have resulted in a change in the type of hate crimes being committed. Wherepreviously there were more overt hate crimes now you see more covert forms ofdiscrimination. As you mentioned, Gavan, there seems to be a narrativeexpressing relief that gender violence is on the decline, but there are new andequally painful ways in which violence is being inflicted.Shrivastava: Do you feel there is a particular way that sexual and gender-basedviolence is seen in Japan?Gray: Of course, though it has changed a lot, especially in the past decade.Women had significantly lower status in Japan throughout most of its history.Similar to many societies, women had a much stronger role within the privatefamily structure but publicly and officially they were almost invisible. It was onlyafter the Meiji Restoration in the late 1800s that things began to change as a resultof Western influence. My own university was founded by a woman, UmekoTsuda, who travelled to the United States at just 6 years of age and on her returnto Japan set up one of the first institutes of higher learning open to women. It wasonly after World War II, however, that women’s rights became firmly entrenchedin Japanese law. Ironically, the new constitution, thanks to the efforts of a womancalled Beate Sirota Gordon, gave Japanese women even more rights thanAmerican women of the time; however, because they had not fought for theserights in the same manner as American women, actual deep societal change was14 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.much slower to occur, which is one of the reasons why Japan still ranks very poorin terms of gender equality. To answer your question, there is a split betweenmodern Japan, which views gender violence in much the same way as the West,and older attitudes whereby domestic violence can be considered a private matter,and where the wearing of improper clothing can still be viewed as being partiallyresponsible for crimes that affect women. From my own experience, this is not agenerational issue though, as much as it is one of lack of education on thesematters. Well-educated older people are unlikely to hold the latter views andpoorly educated young people are more so.Shrivastava: How would you define ‘commodified violence’?Gray: I think it relates to the concept of ‘precarity’ that you speak about inyour chapters so if perhaps you could define precarity first, I can build off that.Shrivastava: Well, for me, precarity is the ontological state of being of anindividual who is rendered powerless and vulnerable due to the circumstancesthey face and who may be left feeling helpless against the actors that areresponsible for their situation.Gray: Thank you. A common danger for women in the sex industry is that theycan be viewed by many, both their customers and wider society, not as theworkers of an industry but as its products. In this view, they are things and as suchdevoid of human rights. This is the nature of what I consider commodifiedviolence: it depersonalises the subject and strips them of rights, dignity, agencyand their voice. It is not so much about the action of ‘sale’ but the action ofmaking them into a ‘commodity’ that can be traded without regard for how thisact affects them on a human level. It certainly includes the elements of power-lessness and vulnerability that you mentioned. Of course, it doesn’t apply to allwomen in the sex industry and some can take stronger personal control of theirroles within it, but a great many are left in far more precarious states. Even wherethey can achieve economic stability, as long as they remain within the industry,their place in society remains fragile and open to abuse, whether by publicdiscrimination or political exploitation.Shrivastava: Are there any social or political barriers when it comes toreforming the sex industry in Japan? In India, for example, sex work is acontroversial subject and NGOs or social workers are putting their lives at risk totry to break the chain of sexual trafficking. Also, the system in India is riddledwith corruption which also makes the process difficult.Gray: There is definitely not as much direct threat to life as might exist inIndia. From what I know from speaking to activists and people working in theindustry, physical violence of any kind, while a constant threat, is not among thetop concerns that sex workers have and it certainly isn’t a significant problem forthose working to support them. Generally, the problem is far more economic innature. For the workers in the industry, avoiding becoming trapped in a spiral ofdebt and achieving economic stability and independence are key goals. For themajority of workers, alleviating economic pressure is the entire reason for theirentry into the industry. However, those who are not in debt when they enter it areoften forced into debt by unscrupulous business practices or by falling into theunhealthy lifestyle that surrounds much of the industry.Gender-Based Violence 15The average sex worker has little knowledge of how to handle money or dealwith contracts that are often used to tie workers to specific shops or pressure theminto work they would rather not do. Another key aim for many is to preserve theiranonymity. Again, while they have chosen the industry as a means of addressingeconomic problems they may have, they typically wish to do this anonymously, tothe extent possible. In other words, they want to keep their working life andpersonal life separate. The contracts they sign can be used, again by the worstcompanies, to pressure workers – by saying that if they break contracts, quit theirjob or fail to repay debts, the company will contact their families or they will suethem publicly, exposing their career choice to the world. For similar reasons,workers are often hesitant to file tax returns listing their employment as sex work,not because they want to cheat the system but because they are worried about lossof privacy. They are left with a choice of sacrificing their anonymity or riskingfalling foul of the law. This is a key element of the precarious state they exist in;their industry is legal in name but in practice lacks the support systems and accessto official systems that other industries typically have. Because of the bias againstsex work, there is a widespread image of those involved in it as shiftless, greedy orparasitical. As a result, the public, police and politicians often view them as agroup that is breaking social or legal rules and which needs to be punished ratherthan a group that are pursuing legal work and who are in need of support toaddress the hazards associated with their industry. Beyond debt and privacyconcerns, these extend to things like STDs, mental health, addiction,child-rearing, stalkers and more.Shrivastava: Do they have an avenue to speak/protest against the violence theyface?Gray: Although the sex industry has a centuries old history in Japan, in thepast there was never any strong, centralised organisation through which itsworkers could find a voice. This doesn’t mean that the industry was unsupervised.On the contrary, the Japanese government, for the purposes of disease preventionand simple efficiency, if not necessarily an interest in women’s rights, has long hadbureaucratic systems to regulate the rules governing the industry. In terms ofsafeguarding the workers’ own interests, however, there has been little beyondloose collectives and affiliated publications that were small in size and wieldedlittle political influence. In 1956 the government passed a law that would end legalprostitution and one of the groups, the Shin Yoshiwara Joshi Hoken Kumiai,criticised it by saying, ‘We do not want to do this work but before you end itplease tell us how we will feed our parents’. There are a lot of sex workers inJapan who still engage in their work to support parents who are poor, ill or indebt, to support their own single-parent families, or to pay for expensive collegefees. Yet there are still negative stereotype of sex workers as people who arechasing easy money. There are groups that try to represent their collective voice,like the SWASH workers alliance, but there needs to be much greater supportfrom outside the industry if the tired misconceptions, bias and lack of under-standing are going to alter in any meaningful way.Gray: Nidhi, in your chapter you focus on the violence women experiencedduring the Post-Partition period. I’m curious to what extent the events of this16 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.period have been explored by female writers and directors? Have there been any?Were there any barriers to female voices arising in the artistic world?Shrivastava: That is an excellent question, Gavan. Yes, there are novels andfilms by female writers, including Amrita Pritam who wrote the novel, Pinjar,which was made into a film in 2003. It was about a strong, female lead who isabducted and later forced to marry. However, she has conflicting feelings as herabductor is someone who has good values and who abducted her due to ancestraltraditions. There are other authors such as Pakistani-American writer, BapsiSidhwa, who writes about her experience as a young Parsi girl witnessing theevents of the Partition in Lahore in the novel Cracking India. Deepa Mehta’sEarth dealt with similar themes, and then there is another writer, Anita RauBadami, who has written a novel about the Canadian diaspora’s experience of theaftermath of the Partition in Can You Hear the Nightingale Singh? Therefore, yes,there are numerous contributions of women writers and filmmakers who haveworked on this topic and they have typically placed a strong focus on subjectssuch as rape, the abduction of women, the tattooing of their names on their wristsand so on.I don’t think there are any specific barriers against women’s artistic voices.However, there was a popular Urdu writer, Ismat Chugtai, who explored themesof female sexuality and femininity. In 1942, her story Lihaaf caused an uproarbecause it dealt with themes of female homosexuality. She was, in fact, called totrial at the Lahore High Court for it. So, there are indeed female writers who haveproduced important works covering the treatment of women during that period.Gray: As I mentioned in regard to sex work in Japan, the public view of theissue is often oversimplified and inaccurate. Is this the same case regarding thepeople’s understanding of the gender element of genocide in India, or regardingthe experience of minority gay men and women in South Africa? One concern Ihave with public attitudes to this issue in Japan is not that they are bad but, apartfrom within small, directly involved groups, that they have not really evolved inany significant way over recent decades. For those that are not directly connected,such issues are often presented to broader audiences by focusing on the mostdramatic and titillating elements, reducing the subject to oversimplified tropesrather than really trying to educate people or generate a shift in perceptions. Doyou experience anything similar in your own studies?Shrivastava: Yes, you are right Gavan. In India, the Partition is seen as a darkchapter in India’s history and it is often eclipsed by the topic of India’s inde-pendence. It is also only in the last decade that there has been a felt urgency tomemorialise the cataclysmic event. For example, the first museum on the Partitionwas established in 2017 in Amritsar, Punjab. There are also two new archives thathave been established in Berkley, California in the United States and in Pakistan.However, the issue for the public is that it is still somewhat taboo. In fact, I havespoken with another Indian academic who said that only now, in 2021, was shecomfortable sharing stories of the Partition with her family. Earlier, they had feltthat the wound was too raw and painful to talk about. Thus, it is not shown inmainstream discourse, even in an oversimplified way. Rather, it was renderedinvisible to the public until the last decade or so. I did not hear about the PartitionGender-Based Violence 17myself within my family. It was only as I pursued my academic career and beganmy graduate studies that I began to realise its importance, especially in regard toIndia’s contemporary rape culture.Gray:Nidhi, you mentioned that ‘there is an inexorable link between genocidaland sexual or gender-based violence’, and from what I know about the Partitionthis seems to be quite evident. I have read that the attacks on women are often forthe purpose of humiliation and that, perhaps because of this, other women wouldoften be involved in the attacks. Setting aside the inherent violent and sexualelement of such crimes, do you feel that this element of humiliation is a significantpart of why women are targeted? Perhaps, that they are seen as a symbol ofcultural or ethnic purity and that by attempting denigrate them, the perpetratorscan indirectly attack that which they are perceived to represent?Shrivastava: Thank you for highlighting this point, Gavan. I do think a betterword that speaks further of the idea that you are calling attention to is that ofshame, rather than humiliation. Even though humiliation was definitely part ofthe violence the women experienced, I don’t think it fully captures the reasonswhy the women in the South Asian subcontinent faced the treatment they didfrom not just their own kin but also their communities, as well as the newlyformed India and Pakistan. Yes, indeed, there were multiple reasons why thewomen were seen as the ultimate target for violence. For one, the loss of theirsexual honour would bring shame to the respective ethnic community. Second,rape is arguably a weapon of war – a method by which the female population canbe controlled. However, during the Partition, these concepts were intertwined andcomplex in their own way, in that the fear of rape and abduction drove relatives,especially male members of a family, to encourage female victims to commitsuicide, or to kill them themselves, in order to protect the honour of their family.In my research, I came across the story of Bir Bahadur Singh and his mother,Basant Kaur. Kaur was among the women who had survived in spite of tryingnumerous times to jump to her death into a well. During an interview with Singh,he makes mention of women who jumped into the well survived multiple times,but he never informs the interviewer that Kaur was his mother. Later, theinterviewee realises that that Singh ‘had not mentioned that she was his motherbecause in having escaped death, she could not be classed with the women whohad, in fact, died. Much easier, then, to speak of his sister who died an ‘hon-ourable’ death than the mother who survived’.This is part of the way that the ultimate goal of this genocidal violence wasbroader than the crime itself and sought to bring shame and dishonour to theother community. So, yes, I think you are right in stating that women’s bodies,especially their sexual purity, are treated as what Menon and Bhasin have called,‘territories to be conquered, claimed or marked by the assailant’. But, the violenceas you can see was multifaceted and the assailants were not just men from othercommunities, but sometimes men who were from the same family. This is one ofthe reasons why it is such an uncomfortable and uneasy issue that has beensilenced over the years. Because it is something that touches on family honour andshame, it is something which can have generational impact.18 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.Gray: Do either of you think that the forms of gender-based violence havechanged from what existed in the past? Deepesh, I think you are looking at oneform that has only recently been recognised, though, of course, that does notmean it has not always been a problem.Dayal: Yes Gavan, whilst the forms of violence you mention are quite overt innature, I have been researching the covert forms of violence called micro-aggressions. When these microaggressions are directed towards a person’s sexualorientation they are referred to as sexual orientation microaggressions. Examplesof these are when gay men are told that they are confused about their sexualorientation. Perpetrators also use derogatory words when referring to LGBTQ1people. In my research, I have found that such microaggressions decrease socialcohesion and adversely impact the mental well-being of gay men. In particular, Ihave been looking at their prevalence within the South African Indian commu-nity, microaggression perpetrated by South African Indian people against SouthAfrican gay Indian men. This is something that has been written about innewspaper articles but it has not yet been properly studied through actualresearch.Shrivastava: Gavan, you mention the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic andhow it has affected the sex industry in Japan. I was wondering if you could speakmore about suicide within the sex industry. Would you consider it as a form ofviolence as well? I’m wondering because mass suicides were common and part ofthe national narrative in India during the Partition.Gray: Japan has a serious issue with suicide and has one of the highest rates forhighly developed economies. I think the number is over 20,000 per year, which isactually a decline from past levels. However, in Japan it tends to affect signifi-cantly more men than women and the primary demographic groups it affects arecompany workers and the elderly. Of course, to say that women make up asmaller proportion of overall victims, should not be taken to mean that the impacton individual women is any less severe, or that specific groups of women mightnot suffer far higher rates. The increase in female suicide rates in 2020 is a strongsign that women have been disproportionally impacted by the pandemic whencompared to men. Yet, the sex industry is simply one area of work in whichwomen are especially vulnerable and trapped in an economically precariousposition: these economic pressures also affect other women in temporary orunstable employment, or single-parent mothers. I don’t think I would classifythese broader economic forces as violence though, unless you think of them in thesame way as the violence of a storm. Though generated by the economic systemthey do not have a direct source of agency, in effect, they are system-wide forcesrather than targeted effects and I think in terms of harm done to women (and sexworkers) it is the failure to protect them from the effects of this economic violencethat is a charge that can reasonably be laid against the government. In otherwords, the government is not directly committing the violence that would causesuicide rates to increase, instead it is showing a high level of apathy towards thosefactors when it has the capability and responsibility to do something to offsetthem.Gender-Based Violence 19Shrivastava: You also mentioned something called ‘father industries’ in yourarticle. I know that there is also a commodification of the Lolita girl culture and Iwas wondering if you could speak further to this point?Gray: In Japan this is something now most commonly referred to as ‘PapaKatsu’, which means father activities, and it is similar to what would be calledSugar Daddies or ‘sugaring’ in the West. However, the cultural forces at play arequite different and this is something I will be looking at in my later chapterfocusing on gender norms in Japan. Suffice to say, that it is an area with someserious unaddressed problems but also one that tends to be very poorly under-stood by the West, which tends to judge it through its own particular cultural lens.I think this is a good example of the problems that we face, though. Many issues,like the Lolita issue in Japan, can seem quite clear-cut to Western viewers. In thiscase, they equate it to paedophilia and wonder why Japan allows it to persist soopenly. However, the nature of the problem, as well as the way in which itconnects to society, traditions and norms, is very different in Japan and externalperspectives are, generally and predictably, quite superficial in their analysis.Shrivastava: Do either of you feel that governmental responses to these formsof violence are sufficient or effective?Gray: I think one issue in this regard is the false choice between an immediate,shallow response or a gradual, deeper, long-term response. In Japan, with regardto the sex industry, some activists favour the Nordic model – which criminalisesthe purchase of sex – and this is typically seen as a step towards abolition of thesex trade. Others would prefer to see complete legalisation of the industry. Ineither case, these are both long-term goals and with Japan being an especially riskaverse country, these would take years, if not decades to achieve. Regardless ofwhich option you would prefer, the danger is that a lot of political effort can befocused on achieving only the long-term goals and that meaningful, immediate,short-term assistance can be neglected.In Japan’s case at least, I think these kinds of issues should always beapproached in a two-track fashion, one that researches and considers long-termchanges and others that look at current and on-going harm and how that can bealleviated in the interim. With the Japanese sex industry we can see very slow,long-term change occurring but more needs to be done to offset the persistingharm – such as by providing greater funding to NGOs that actually work tosupport the women who are affected. This is why, when you study issues like this,I think an interdisciplinary approach is an excellent basis to start from but it needsto evolve into an inter-institutional approach, where the various parties involved –those working on long-term aims and those dealing with short-term solutions –need to be sharing data and toolsets, learning from one another and supportingone another’s goals.Dayal: I think these types of flaws in government response, the apathy youmentioned, are quite common. Although the South African Constitution setseveryone on a nominally equal level, LGBTQ1 people still experience high levelsof hate crimes which extends to violence, assault, bullying and cyberbullying.Although they have achieved certain rights, such as the rights to marry a partnerof the same sex, adopt a child together and automatically inherit their partner’s20 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.estate, there are still many areas in which they are vulnerable and unprotected. Assuch, South African LGBTQ1 persons can be said to straddle two worlds, onethat offers intricate legal protections and another, in which continuing and violentpersecution is commonplace and where there is no abatement of these sociallyingrained problems in sight.Shrivastava: In my case, Partition has been seen as a dark chapter of India’snational history and it is only in the last decade that we are seeing an increasinginterest in its impact and the Diaspora community. Alongside the Partitionarchives that were created in the United States, there are also events happening inIndia itself to memorialise the event. In Kolkata, they have set up the first virtualPartition museum, which focuses on the collective trauma in Bengal during thePartition. But, with that said, the wounds are still continuing to heal as peopleslowly begin to confront the realities that their ancestors would have experiencedduring this time. While there is an increasing interest in the Partition, it’s still not aprimary focus in mainstream culture and I think it will take some time for boththe government and public to come to terms with its full legacy. Of course, thefirst step in such patterns of change is to raise awareness of and become able totalk openly about these issues.Gender-Based Violence 21This page intentionally left blankChapter 1Genocidal Violence, Biopolitics, andTreatment of Abducted and Raped Womenin the Aftermath of 1947 Partition in IndiaNidhi ShrivastavaAbstractAs we reckon with the #MeToo movement, the gender-based violence thatoccurred during the 1947 Partition continues to remain forgotten in main-stream discourses and is an emotive and polarising issue within both Indiaand its diaspora. Just like mainstream news in the United States covered theGabby Petito case, causing a controversy as it led to the realisation that therape and gender-based violence of missing indigenous women were notcovered, it can be suggested that mainstream news channels both withinIndia and in the diaspora construct narratives that privilege the stories ofsome over others – with issues of shame, izzat (‘honour’) and policing ofwomen’s bodies compounding the silence in South Asian communities. Inthis chapter, I argue that we need to rethink the Partition as a genocide torecognise the gender-based violence that occurred on women’s bodies as thecataclysmic event occurred. I discuss the feminist historiographical researchled by Urvashi Butalia, Kamla Bhasin and Ritu Menon who interviewedsurvivors in the aftermath of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that triggered theirresearch and reminded them of the Partition violence. It is only recentlywhen the 1947 Partition Archives (in 2010) and the Partition Museum(in 2017) that the conversations of Partition are also taking place in aca-demic spaces.Keywords: 1947 partition; the #MeToo movement; genocide studies;partition studies; central recovery operation; 1947 partition archivesGender Violence, the Law, and Society, 23–33Copyright © 2022 Nidhi ShrivastavaPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

The Partition displaced an estimated10 million to 20 million people in its aftermath, which led to an outbreak ofsectarian violence as Hindu-Muslim communities that had co-existed for centurieswere enveloped in carnage – looting, massacres, forced religious conversions,mass abductions, and heinous sexual and gender-based violence. Unlike theHolocaust, which was the state-led, the Partition is more akin to brutal, ethnicviolence that has been observed in genocides like Rwanda – a by-product ofdecolonisation.1During the years leading up to Indian independence, the Partition becameimminent after Mohammad Ali Jinnah (the leader of Muslim league) believedthat there would not be enough Muslim representation in India, and demanded aseparate country – Pakistan. The borders that divided India and Pakistan werehastily drawn by British civil servant, Cyril Radcliffe, and were not known tocitizens even on the eve of India and Pakistan’s Independence Day (Pollack,2007). As a result, brutal ethnic and sectarian violence took place. Political sci-entist Paul R. Brass (2003) describes the violence that occurred at this time as‘retributive genocide’ (p. 72). Unlike most genocides, it was neither sanctioned bythe state nor spontaneous. Rather, Brass points out, ‘…there were also local actsof violence carried out for a multiplicity of reasons and motives that were notgenocidal in intent: loot, capture of property, abduction of women. Moreover,much of the larger-scale violence was mutual’ (p. 72). Historian William Dal-rymple calls it a ‘mutual genocide’ (2015) and describes the violence in thefollowing terms: ‘the carnage was especially intense, with massacres, arson, forcedconversions, mass abductions, and savage sexual violence. Some 75,000 womenwere raped, and many of them were then disfigured or dismembered’. Americanphotojournalist Margaret Bourke-White (1963), who had witnessed the liberationof Nazi camps and later found herself in India as the Partition became imminent,describes the violence that took place during the Direct Action Day in 1946Calcutta as follows:1Paul Rusesabagina’s An Ordinary Man (2006) speaks at length about the history ofRwanda, which was colonised by the Belgians who considered Tutsis more superior thanHutus. They were responsible for creating identity cards, which were later used during theRwandan genocide. In Midnight’s Furies: The Deadly Legacy of India’s Partition (2016),Journalist Nisid Hajri has also drawn a similar comparison between the Partition andRwandan genocide. He writes, ‘The conflagration stands as one of the deadliest and mostbrutal civil conflicts of the twentieth century, unrivaled in scale until the 1994 massacres inRwanda. Yet like Rwanda, the riots were relatively confined in time and space. The worstkillings lasted only about six weeks. While the chaos spread throughout most of westernPakistan and great swathes of northern India, much of the rest of the subcontinent was notdirectly affected. Today Partition is a horrific memory for millions – but it is just that, amemory’ (Hajari, 2015, Chapter 1, paragraph 12). Though rape was declared a war crimein 1919, this status was not finalised until 1997 during the trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu in theInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).24 Nidhi ShrivastavaOn the heels of this announcement [Jinnah’s declaration ofDirect Action Day], violence broke out in Calcutta. I flewthere from Bombay and found a scene that looked likeBuchenwald. The street were literally strewn with dead bodies,an officially estimated six thousand, but I myself saw manymore…In Calcutta, a city larger than Detroit, vast areas weredark with ruins and black with the wings of culture that hoveredover impartially dead Hindus and Muslims. Like Germany’sconcentration camps, this was the ultimate result of racial andreligious prejudice.(p. 283)Indeed, Dalrymple notes that ‘the comparison with the death camps is notso far-fetched as it may seem. Partition is central to modern identity in theIndian subcontinent, as the Holocaust is to identity among Jews, brandedpainfully onto the regional consciousness by memories of almost unimaginableviolence’.Partition remains an emotive and polarising issue within India and in thediaspora communities. Just like mainstream news in the United States coveredthe Gabby Petito case, which inspired controversy as it led to the realisation thatthe rape and gender-based violence of missing indigenous women were not previ-ously covered, it can be suggested that mainstream news channels both within Indiaand in the diaspora construct narratives that privilege the stories of some overothers – with issues of shame, izzat (‘honour’) and policing of women’s bodiescompounding the silence in South Asian communities (Shrivastava & Bibi, 2021).2At the peak of the #MeToo movement in 2018, Rochelle G. Saidel and BatyaBrutin held an exhibition entitled Violated: Women in Holocaust and Genocide atthe Ronald Feldman Gallery in New York. Although the exhibition brought uppivotal questions on genocidal sexual violence from countries such as Bosnia,Rwanda, Darfur, Yazidi and Guatemala, the 1947 Partition was not highlighted atthe exhibition. Only in the last decade, academics and activists have started thework to preserve and research the Partition, leading to the establishment of thePartition Archive (in 2010), the citizenship archive of Pakistan and India’s firstmuseum dedicated to the Partition which was founded in 2017 in Amritsar.While sexual and gender-based violence received worldwide recognition duringthe #MeToo movement in 2017,3 the turning point in India was the 2012 Delhi2Recently, sociology scholar Somia R. Bibi and I published a conversation on the silencingof Partition narratives within the context of the #MeToo movement in the South Asiadiaspora in the United Kingdom and United States, that was published in the followingarticle. To learn further about this issue, please see the following link: https://bloomsburyliterarystudiesblog.com/continuum-literary-studie/2021/12/metoo-in-south-asia-subcontinent-and-diaspora.html.3Found by Tarana Burke in 2006, the #MeToo movement gained popularity after actressAlyssa Milano tweeted the hashtag #MeToo to encourage victims of sexual violence topublicise allegations of sex crime against their preparators in 2017.Aftermath of 1947 Partition in India 25gang-rape case, when a young woman was heinously gang-raped in a bus whileshe and her friend were returning home after seeing a movie together. During thistime, the news coverage called attention to rape cases that dated back to the 1970s(BBC 2013, Newsable 2018), but they did not cover the brutal sexual violence thatoccurred during the Partition.In this chapter, I argue that we need to recognise the Partition as a genocide,not only on a global level but on a national level as well. The Partition is rarelyacknowledged in private spheres, and if it is brought up in popular culture, therepresentations do not acknowledge or recognise the gender-based violence thatoccurred during this tumultuous period. Recent trends in Genocide studies, asrepresented in the works of Barta (1985), Rashed and Short (2012), Totten,Theriault, and Joeden-Forgey (2017), have shown that the field is recasting juristRaphael Lamkin’s original definition of the term – genocide – to make it moreinclusive and include countries that have been undergoing the process ofdecolonisation. In his article, ‘After the Holocaust: Consciousness of Genocide inAustralia’, Tony Barta (1985) contends that the word genocide has been associ-ated globally with the Holocaust but he suggests that it should be also thought ofwithin the context of the massacre of Australian aborigines (p. 157) and that the‘prospect of genocide – “the most certain getting rid of the race”’ also applies tocountries that had been colonised in the past. As Hitchcock, Flowerday, andBabchuk (2017) point out in their study, the definition of genocide initiallyestablished by the UNCHR that says that a genocide is ‘a set of acts committedwith the intent to destroy groups whole or in part’ (p. 10), other scholars have alsoincluded ‘actions as intentional prevention of ethnic groups from practicing theirtraditional customs; forced resettlement; denial of access to food relief, healthassistance and development funds; and/or purposeful destruction of the habitatsutilised by indigenous populations’ (p. 10). Interestingly, in their edited volumeabout the controversies in genocide studies, Theriault and Joeden-Forgey onlyfocus on trends of genocides within Rwanda, Darfur and Armenia, but the IndianPartition is still not recognised in these conversations.Haifa Rashed and Damien Short (2012)’s article, however, sheds light onrecent conversations in which scholars are locating a ‘nexus between colonialprocesses and genocidal practices’ (p. 1144). Rashed and Short contend thatLamkin’s conceptualisation of genocide is ‘intrinsically colonial’ (p. 1144). Thus,their new perspective sheds light to the ways in which genocide studies and thedefinition of genocide itself is evolving. As has been shown in the opening par-agraphs with figures and quotes from the historians and photographers who havestudied the Partition and witnessed its violence, the genocidal violence thatoccurred was not due to one state actor that was determined to destroy a race/ethnicity. Rather, the violence was similar to Rwanda and Cambodia, in that theact of partitioning India left many displaced. People were unaware where theboundaries of their own new countries were and they feared that their ethnicmajority village would go to the country they did not belong to. Hence, the brutaland heinous ethnic and sectarian violence that occurred since 1946. Therefore, thePartition does not enter into the national consciousness or raise awareness among26 Nidhi Shrivastavayounger generations who may be unfamiliar with the genocidal violence thatoccurred during this time.4 In the next section, I discuss how rape was used as aweapon of genocide. Furthermore, I’ll show that the violence that women experi-enced was not only perpetrated by members of other communities but also by theirown family members, who reiterated the problematic idea that women shouldembrace death over being abducted or raped by men from other communities. Ifthe women escaped and did not experience violence from their own family mem-bers, then they faced ostracisation and rejection from their family after they wereoften forcibly recovered by the Central Recovery Operation (1948–1957).Rape as a Weapon of Genocide: The Story of Women’sExperiences During the PartitionThere is a powerful link between genocides and sexual/gender-based violence. Infact, after a decades-long silence that followed both the Holocaust (1941–1945)and the Rwandan genocide (1994), only recently have scholars started to exploreand acknowledge the testimonies of women who either witnessed or sufferedsexual assault, rape and brutal accounts of violence during these genocides.5 Thediscourse of Partition has been absent from India’s national imagination. As filmhistorian Bhaskar Sarkar (2009) notes, in post-independence India the Partitionwas seen as a ‘one-time aberration in an otherwise continuous tradition of secularunity’ (p. 34). According to Sarkar, the ‘post-Partition Indian ego’ was con-structed by ‘the experience of loss’ (p. 35) which the individual was never able toface, thus never able to recognise the pain and trauma of that loss. Undeniably,Sarkar also suggests that the goal of Indian politicians was to find ways to erasethe Partition – as if the sectarian violence, mass rape and abductions had neveroccurred. This mentality shaped the arduous and complex work ofnation-building. Because of this, we have not developed the language needed toaddress the pain and trauma that many families experienced. Also, until recently,there were no monuments to mourn the aftermath of the violence within India.Therefore, families, including my own, have never discussed the Partition, nor itsimpact on our lives.The various types of violence that took place on women’s bodies have beenlargely neglected and are missing from the discourse surrounding India’s4During my online writing sessions, one of the academics from Calcutta realised that in herfamily, the Partition is not discussed because the memories are too painful. She also sharedthis with me after she learned more about my research.5Research on sexual violence during the Holocaust began in the 1980s. For example, in1983, Esther Katz and Joan Ringelheim planned the first ever Conference on WomenSurviving the Holocaust in New York, NY (Hedgepeth & Saidel, 2010). But it wasn’tuntil Saidel & Hedgepeth’s 2010 anthology that the academic conversation among feministscholars gained traction and wider visibility, perhaps not unlike Menon and Bhasin (1993)research in relation to the genocide in India.Aftermath of 1947 Partition in India 27contemporary rape culture.6 While the actual numbers are unknown, UrvashiButalia (2000) notes that at least 75,000 women were kidnapped (p. 3). However,this history has only recently been recognised in India. It was largely disregardeduntil 1984 when the anti-Sikh violence took place that motivated scholars such asButalia (1993, 1995, 1997, 2000), Ritu Menon and Kamla Bhasin (1993, 1996,1998), and Veena Das (2006) to raise concern over the State’s treatment ofwomen. During the Post-Partition violence, often, these women experiencedmulti-layered traumatic experiences. Not only were they forcefully kidnappedduring the mass migrations and forced to marry their abductors, they alsoexperienced a second separation from their newly formed families and childrenand faced rejection from their society and families if they returned to their‘original nation’ (which was determined based on their religion), experiencedforced abortions and feelings of helplessness as they experienced abandonment.Numerous women were subject to state, communal and intra-violence. Thedegrees of their trauma, however, varied in each individual case. Menon andBhasin (1998) use the expression ‘honourably dead’ to demonstrate the sexualviolence that women experienced during this time. The authors mention that theforms of gender-based violence included ‘stripping; parading naked; mutilatingand disfiguring; tattooing or branding the breasts and genitalia with triumphantslogans; amputating breasts; knifing open the womb; raping; killing foetuses…’(p. 43). This is not different from the narratives of gender-based violence that wehave seen in the Rwandan genocide, as an example. On 2 September 1998, theInternational Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda (ICTR) convicted Jean Paul Akayesufor rape and inhumane treatment of women. As Bijleveld, Morssinkhof, andSmeulers (2009) note ‘this was a landmark decision because for the first time everrape was being prosecuted as a crime against humanity and as a war crime for aninternational tribunal’ (p. 213). They further discuss instances of sexual violencethat occurred during the Rwandan genocide upon the bodies of Tutsi women –‘many of whom were subjected to the worst public humiliation, mutilated andraped several times in public, in the Bureau communal premises, and often bymore than one assailant’ (qtd. in Bijleveld, Morssinkhof, and Smeulers, p. 213).6Here, when I discuss the term – contemporary Indian rape culture – I am specificallyreferring to the actions of toxic masculinity and GBV that have been widespread in theSouth Asian subcontinent. In fact, a recent article by Rudabeh Shahid, Kaveri Sarkar, andAzeem Khan (2021) also addresses the following: ‘The weaponizing of women’s bodies hasalways been part of the fabric of South Asia, with mass rapes in 1947 and 1971 being integralto the birth of the three most populous countries in the region. Women’s bodies became abattlefield for national honor, and the shame continues to be laid on the door of the victimwhile perpetrators face no repercussions’ (emphasis added). Although the term ‘rapeculture’ was originally coined by the second-wave feminists in 1970s, I use it as a way totalk about the complexities and nuances regarding the culture of gender-based violence as ithas existed within India, specifically. But, as can be seen in the work of Shahid, Sarkar andKhan, the issue of GBV is widespread within the South Asian subcontinent. My work alsodoes not address the GBV that occurs within the LGBTQ1 community in India, becausetheir sexualities themselves are often criminalised.28 Nidhi ShrivastavaThe quote belongs to the Prosecutor v. Jean Paul Akayesu case and, yet, thesimilarities in the practices that occurred in the Partition and the Rwandangenocide are striking.During their research, Menon and Bhasin were unprepared to listen to nar-ratives of women who were ‘forced to die – at the hands of men in their ownfamilies, or by their own hands’ (1998, p. 45; emphasis added). To prevent rapeand abduction, women were either ‘poisoned, strangled, or burned to death, putto the sword or drowned’ (1998, p. 45). The authors further argue that ‘it wasmade abundantly clear to them that death was preferred to “dishonour”, that inthe absence of their men the only choice available to them was to take their ownlives’ (1998, p. 45; emphasis added). Urvashi Butalia (2000) concurs with Menonand Bhasin’s observations, sharing with her readers that during her research shemet Prakashvanti, a Partition victim-survivor, who was living in the GandhiVanita Ashram at Jalandar, Punjab. During an interview with Butalia, Pra-kashvanti mentioned that ‘her husband came to her and suggested he kill her.“Else”, he told her, “they will dishonour you”’ (p. 170). She ultimately notes thatshe recalls very little of the aftermath because she had lost consciousness after herhusband violently struck her (p. 170). Butalia notes that according to culturalperceptions ‘women could not, therefore, be named as violent beings. Therefore,their actions are narrated and sanctified by the tones of heroic, even otherworldly,valour. Such narratives are meant to keep women within their aukat [Hindi:status], their ordained boundary, which is one that defines them as non-violent’(p. 171; author’s emphasis). In other words, the men, for the most part, prob-lematically assumed that women were not capable of defending their honour andsexual purity, and thus, were vulnerable to gender-based violence by men from theothered ethnic communities. If they chose to defy their family members, especiallytheir fathers and brothers, the women were seen as pariahs and as bringing shameand dishonour to their respective families. Thus, even after they had beenrecovered, Hindu and Sikh families rejected them. Examples of such rejection canbe seen in films such as Pinjar (Hindi: Cage, 2003) and Khamosh Pani (Hindi:Silent Waters, 2003), which explore the psychological, social and emotionalexperiences that women experienced after they met their families years after theirtraumatic abduction. Indeed, this national narrative, which privileges and cele-brates women who died to protect their own and their respective communities’honour, supersedes the stories of women who were raped and abducted during thechaotic violence of the Partition.The nation-building project in India located the women who had been exposedto gendered Partition violence in a site of precarity in the aftermath of thePartition.7 Feminist philosopher Judith Butler’s (2004) theoretical concept ofprecarity allows us to understand how biopolitics functions when a country faces7Precarity is defined as an ontological state of being when an individual who is leftvulnerable due to conditions they face and who may be left to feel helpless against theactors that are responsible for their situation. In this case, I’ll take it to mean that theperson faces either social, economic, political, religious or gender persecution or acombination of all the aforementioned.Aftermath of 1947 Partition in India 29a political crisis. Biopolitics, in this context, can be defined as the Indian gov-ernment’s responsibility towards its citizens. Although it was not responsible forthe initial displacement of these women, the role of the Indian government in theviolence the women experienced contains two prime examples of biopoliticsdirected at women, which created precarious identities and circumstances.In the aftermath of the Partition, both India and Pakistan decided to restorethe abducted women to their ‘original countries’ based on their religion, oftenwithout their agreement. The precarious circumstances that these abductedwomen experienced on the outset were products of communal violence ratherthan the Indian State. In fact, with the creation of the Central Recovery Oper-ation (1948–1957), the State worked to reinstate them within the newly formedIndia. The programme began with an agreement – the Inter-Dominion Treaty of6 December 1947 – between the Indian and Pakistani governments, which had thegoal to restore as many abducted women as possible. Mridula Sarabai, a politi-cally influential chief social worker, and Rameshwari Nehru oversaw the pro-gramme. At this time, Sarabai received a team which mostly composed of malepolicemen, who were to aid her in the recovery and restoration process.According to Menon and Bhasin, the recoveries were carried out between 1947and 1952, but women were still being recovered until at least 1956. During thisperiod, about 30,000 women were recovered (Menon and Bhasin, ‘AbductedWomen’, 16).In a state of emergency, the government created laws that defiled the rightsthat abducted women had in the process of their re-integration into modern India.It problematically assumed that if a woman was found cohabiting with a man of adifferent religion after a certain date in 1947, she had been forcefully abducted(and potentially converted). While some women were happy to be recovered, theIndian state was unprepared for women who resisted the actions of the socialworkers (Menon & Bhasin, 1996, p. 16). Menon and Bhasin note that theiridentities ‘were in a continual state of reconstruction and construction, makingthem, as one woman said to us, “permanent refugees”’ (Menon & Bhasin, 1996,p. 16).The term permanent refugee underscores the precariousness that was relatedwith the Central Recovery Operation because it was ineffective in its cause torestore the recovered women. In theory, Butalia observes, every ‘citizen had achoice in the nation s/he wished to belong to. If a woman had the misfortune ofbeing abducted, however, she did not have such a choice’ (p. 111). The socialworker and tribunal’s decisions often left the women who were recoveredmeaningless often by forcibly removing them from their newfound relationships,their children, and families and sometimes encouraging them to live in ashrams(Hindi: ‘a secluded dwelling’) for the remainder of their lives if they did not wantto live away from their children from mixed unions. Their families perceived thesechildren as illegitimate and did not want to see the women bringing dishonour andshame to them, and thus would ostracise them. The 1960 Hindi film, Chhalia,represents this moment when Shanti (Nutan) introduces her husband Kewal(Rehman) to their son, Anwar. Kewal immediately rejects them, believing thatRehman is the product of her rape and abduction, while, in actuality, he was30 Nidhi Shrivastavaconceived at a time before Kewal and his family abandoned Shanti in the chaos ofthe Partition violence.A second way in which the government played a pivotal role in Post-Partitionviolence against women was revealed in a conversation that occurred in 1996between Aparna Basu and Kamla Patel, a social worker who worked with MridulaSarabai in the Central Recovery Operation. During the interview, Patel mentionsthat the refugee camps where the women were living after their recovery wereworse than cattle sheds (p. 127). She notes that the camps were ‘overcrowded’ dueto a ‘lack of sanitary facilities – there were frequent outbreaks of epidemics anddeaths. Within the limited budget, it was not possible to provide for more than twomeals a day and a pair of clothes’ (p. 127). We only see rare representations of thecamps in film depictions, especially in the early depictions of Partition films. InChhalia (1960), for example, the camps are represented as being clean but are notthe focal point of the film. The recovery camps can also be seen in films such asGovind Nihalani’s Tamas (1989), Deepa Mehta’s Earth (1998), Chandra PrakashDwivedi’s Pinjar (2003), Rahat Kazmi’s Mantostaan (2017) and Nandita Das’sManto (2018). With that said, these filmmakers do not depict the camps as beingunsanitary or unkempt but rather as sanitised versions of crowded areas that canbe found in refugee camps worldwide. It is evident that filmmakers are stayingaway from depicting the government’s role in the Partition, and especially therecovery of women in its aftermath.ConclusionIn my experience, the Partition was not brought to light in conversations withelders in my family who may have witnessed it. Rather, the stories that I hear areof my family’s treating other ethnicities with respect and helping them. But werarely speak of the Partition, by stating that since our family belongs to centralIndia (and not Punjab and Bengal, where most of the atrocities took place) wewere not directly affected by it. As post-colonial theorist Nandi Bhatia (2013)notes, the ‘Partition has been subjected to a haunting silence marked by survivorstoo traumatized or faced with “collective guilt” to talk about it publicly’. (p. 89)The Partition has always been viewed as a dark chapter in modern Indian history –as a rupture that took place. Although there have been initiatives such as the 1947Partition Archive and the Partition Museum, it is only in the last decade that thePartition has become a focus for academics, cultural critics, historians andarchivists. Nonetheless, I argue that the Partition was and is in fact a genocidethat was shaped by interethnic, communal violence as well as rape and sexualviolence, and the subsequent silencing of events as if they never happened. Yet,events such as the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, 1992–1993 Bombay riots, the 2000Gujarat riots and, more recently, the anti-CAA protests, all serve as remindersthat the spectre of the Partition continues to haunt the subcontinent and thewounds from the cataclysmic event are yet to heal.Because there remains a silence in India and the diaspora, these women’straumatic experiences of gender-based violence are not acknowledged, especiallyAftermath of 1947 Partition in India 31as we continue to make sense of the #MeToo movement. Similar to how thenarratives of gender-based violence experienced by indigenous women continue toremain obscured in Western mainstream culture, the narratives of these womenalso do not enter into the conversations of gender-based violence in South Asiaand in the diaspora. Therefore, we need to urgently recognise the narratives ofraped and abducted women to acknowledge the heinous gender and sexualviolence that occurred during the genocidal violence that took place during thePartition.ReferencesBarta, T.

This passive and disinterested tolerance of the industry’squasi-legal state, neither banning prostitution completely nor ensuring that itfollows the transparent rules and regulations expected of other industries,means that it fails to satisfy either of the primary views on transactional sex:prohibition or legalisation. The result is that the women involved in theindustry are subject to various forms of exploitation and abuse that theJapanese government, by failing to take active steps to reform the industry ineither direction, becomes complicit to. Shaped by personal interviews withmembers of the industry and the NGOs that provide them with support, thechapter provides an examination of the industry’s historical development, itsportrayal in popular media and the prevailing social norms regarding theindustry. It then assesses the political and legal responses to the industry andthe glaring oversights that exist in their failure to provide adequate support.Finally, it considers, based upon the self-expressed interests of the womenworking in the industry, in what areas meaningful reform might occur.Keywords: Japan; prostitution; sexual violence; women’s rights; sexuality;sexual normsGender Violence, the Law, and Society, 35–50Copyright © 2022 Gavan Patrick GrayPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

This gives it a distinct variationon what Mulvihill (2018, p. 223) sees as the two primary views of prostitution: onewhich considers transactional sex as inherently violent and a result of deep-rootedpatriarchal structures of gender inequality, and another which considers it alegitimate form of enterprise which should be regulated to guarantee thewell-being and rights of those involved. In the Japanese view, negative attitudesalso contain an element of the sex industry representing a failure to adhere to theaforementioned Western norms, while positive attitudes consider it a necessitythat contributes to broader issues of social harmony and sexual health (Koch,2016). In this way, Japanese perspectives are not as solely focused on the effects ofthe industry on individual women but also on how it relates to society at abroader level.Mulvihill (2018, p. 230) also refers to what she calls ‘symbolic violence’ as aform of domination embedded in everyday actions that prevents its victims fromexpressing grievance, due to acceptance that the system that harms them isregarded as natural, unchangeable or in some way beneficial. This is somethingthat applies very strongly to Japan’s particular form of commercialised sex, wherelong-standing social perception of the industry as a natural, inevitable and evenessential element of society both normalises women’s participation in the industryand weakens their ability to critique or reform it. This chapter considers theJapanese sex industry as existing in a specific limbo-state, between illegality andacceptance, that means it satisfies the desires of neither of the two main per-spectives on prostitution and cannot claim to be safeguarding the welfare of thewomen involved.2 For those who would seek to protect women by prohibitingprostitution entirely (or at least aspire to implement the Nordic Model),3 its openacceptance can be seen as a disregard for the sexual oppression of women. Forthose who would rather see those women protected by having the sex industrytreated as a legitimate form of employment, its nebulous legality leaves thoseworking in the industry in a tenuous and vulnerable state.The current, poorly regulated and monitored nature of the industry can beconsidered to constitute a form of commercial sexual exploitation, which manygovernments recognise as a form of gender-based violence.4 The United Nations1This work was supported by a Kaken grant (18K13005) from the Japan Society for thePromotion of Science.2Although women make up the overwhelming majority of Japan’s sex workers the industryalso contains male and LGBTQ1 members and the points raised in this chapter should beconsidered to apply equally to these groups.3The Nordic Model aims at decreasing the overall demand for transactional sex by makingthe purchase, but not the sale, of sex illegal.4For example, the United States in the Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017, S. 1311(115th): Section 8.3.36 Gavan Patrick Grayalso considers gender-based violence to include the imposition of mental andeconomic harm,5 and the failure of the Japanese government to proactivelysupport the mental and economic welfare of those involved in the industry shouldbe viewed as passive and apathetic participation in an ongoing system of systemicexploitation. It has frequently been shown that those involved in prostitution andtransactional sexual activities are especially vulnerable to various forms of harm,including suicide, mental and emotional health problems, sexually transmitteddiseases, addiction issues, physical violence and economic coercion (Henriksen,2020). Japan is no different in this regard and those working in the industry areoften living in situations of significant precarity, whether as a result of poverty,exposure to danger, or the impact of mental and emotional harm.Yet, even as the industry has grown in size and financial value, its workerscontinue to remain in such precarious economic and social states. The events ofthe COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2019, in particular the Japanese govern-ment’s response to the difficulties faced by sex workers, only served to highlightthe extent to which their work is treated in a contradictory manner, open andsemi-legal, yet held to separate standards of social acceptance. While the gov-ernment itself does not list prostitution as an element of its campaign to endviolence against women, its highlighting of the role of exploitation, sexualviolence and stalking within both the AV (adult video) industry and the JKindustry6 show that it has begun to examine the problems faced by sex workers.7However, as yet, it has taken few steps to generate meaningful reform and itremains to be seen whether its purported support for sex workers will result inmore than mere lip service. Regardless of whether such work is seen as inherentlyharmful to women or the legitimate independent enterprise of people expressingtheir economic agency, the industry as it exists now cannot be said to properlyprotect those involved from various forms of exploitation and abuse and thosewho have the power to intervene to prevent this, yet fail to do so, should beconsidered culpable or actively enabling any harm done.Public Attitudes Towards Sex WorkCommodification refers to the process of treating an object purely in terms of itsmarket value, in other words, judging it purely on the basis of what it can be soldfor. Other elements of intrinsic worth, such as cultural heritage, aesthetic beautyor, in the case of people, their individual identity and fundamental rights, becomerelevant only insofar as they influence the potential price of the commodity in5Something clear stated on the website of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, https://www.unhcr.org/gender-based-violence.html.6JK is short for Jyoshi Kousei (high-school girl) and refers to various enterprises related tothe sexualisation of high-school girls. Although some prefectures have laws prohibitingthose under 18 from such employment, even in these areas younger girls are often exploitedby businesses that skirt the law.7As shown on the Japanese Cabinet Office’s Gender Equality Bureau page on ViolenceAgainst Women, https://www.gender.go.jp/policy/no_violence/.The Commodification of Sex 37question. In relation to sex, commodification means that it is stripped of otherelements, whether romance, procreation or an element of marital fidelity, and isinstead made purely transactional. The formal commodification of sex has a longhistory in Japan, stretching back to the government-sanctioned yūkaku (red-lightdistricts) that included Edo’s (modern Tokyo) Yoshiwara area. The sex industrygrew from these initial roots to a more dispersed, varied and nebulous modernform that includes both the mizu-shōbai (Water Trade), consisting of night-timeentertainment via clubs, bars and cabarets featuring, nominally non-sexual,female companionship, and sei-fūzoku (Sexual Customs), incorporating the var-iegated forms of direct sexual exchange. It represents a significant industry,employing hundreds of thousands of women and men, and generating billions ofdollars of annual revenue (Ogiue & Iida, 2013)8. From love hotels and hostessclubs to soaplands9 and delivery health10 stores, the Japanese sex industryincorporates numerous distinct elements that exist outside of legally prohibitedprostitution in a manner significantly different from more clearly delineatedunderstandings of ‘sex work’ that may exist in the West.The industry also exists in a quasi-shadow realm, cordoned off but gaudily lit.Red-light districts, such as Kabuki-chō, are clearly demarcated from the sur-rounding business areas but there is no effort to hide what they sell. Instead, large,colourful posters and neon signs loudly proclaim what is on offer to passers-byand potential customers. Despite its open nature, the sex industry is considered,by most, to be a disreputable career choice and associated with the criminalunderworld, though government crackdowns on Japan’s organised crime havemade their direct influence far less than it was in the past. The sex industry istolerated, rather than being openly accepted, and those who work in it sufferstigmatisation stemming from these social mores that only compounds the eco-nomic and physical hardships they already face (Kamise, 2013).Public awareness of, and attitudes towards, the industry are often shaped by itsrepresentation in popular culture. Over the past century, many directors haveexamined the issue of sex work through film, such as Kenji Mizoguchi’s AkasenChitai (1956) and Shohei Imamura’s Nippon Konchūki (1963). Imamura alsoexamined the issue in documentary form with Karayuki-san (1975) through therecollection of one woman’s experiences working as a sex worker in Japaneseholdings throughout the Pacific during the early 1900s. Other films framed thechanging nature of the sex trade in relation to Japan’s shifting economic welfare,with Masato Harada’s Baunsu Ko-garusu (1997) highlighting the rise in teenage‘compensated dating’ that followed the collapse of Japan’s economic bubble inthe 1990s.8Kindle Edition, Chapter 1, Page 1, Paragraph 2.9A soapland is a sex business that uses the façade of paying to be bathed by another personas a means of evading the prohibitions against explicitly selling sexual intercourse. Anysexual acts that occur are presented as being coincidental and unrelated to the transfer ofmoney for other services.10Similarly, delivery health services offer out-call massage services that are presented asbeing physical therapy rather than the blatantly sexual exchange that they are in reality.38 Gavan Patrick GrayMovies such as these helped show changes in public understanding of the sexindustry as it moved from an attitude prevalent in the 1960s which saw it almostas an extension of the male-dominated business world (Norma, 2011) to thepost-bubble participation of young women as a form of sexual self-determinationor even resistance against patriarchal structures (Ueno, 2003). In the interim,greater nuance has been added by works such as Penelope Buitenhuis’ Tokyo Girls(2000), which looked at the experiences of foreign women in the industry, Itako’sBaibai Bōizu (2017) and its examination of ‘urisen’, the male prostitution industry,and most recently Kana Yamada’s Taitoru, Kyozetsu (2019), which provided adramatic and realistic view of women working in contemporary conditions.The aforementioned works appeal, however, to a relatively limited audienceand popular television dramas, such as Kiken’na Aneki (2005), Joutei (2007),Hitsudan Hosutesu (2010), have a broader reach and a larger impact in shapingpublic conceptions. In their examination of the reasons why the hostess industrywas an attractive career option for many young women, Miura and Yanagiuchi(2008) highlighted the impact of the positive portrayals found in such dramaswhich frequently showed the industry to be one in which girls from poor back-grounds could find financial success and social status.The hostess industry portrayed in these programmes is only on the periphery ofthe broader sex industry and comprises clubs and bars where men, and frequentlywomen, pay to have their more social and emotional desires catered to byattractive members of the opposite sex. Although, as Allison stated, it exists‘primarily at the level of conversation’ (1994, pp. 7–8), there is considerableoverlap with the more explicit sex industry and workers frequently engage insexual activity with clients (Takeyama, 2005). As such, the tendency of populardramas to portray only the glamorous and successful elements of the hostessindustry, both undersells the darker elements of the reality of sex work andpromotes a distorted understanding of the industry that is only likely to reinforcethe public viewpoints that were dominant during the 1980s ‘Bubble’ era, whereinthe primary reason women engaged in sex work was considered to be as a meansof acquiring pocket-money and to have fun (JCO, 1985).It is unclear whether public perceptions have altered significantly in theinterim. Thankfully, however, academics and professionals have developed amuch clearer and more nuanced view of the industry and of the backgrounds ofmany of those involved. There is a growing awareness of the precarious existencefaced by many sex workers, whether runaway teens, women in debt, singlemothers, women with psychological and emotional problems, or older womenlacking support networks (Nakamura & Suzuki, 2016). Many are women whohave chosen to leave more superficially ‘respectable’ careers such as kindergartenteaching and nursing due to the low salaries and lack of economic freedom thesepaths offered, sacrificing stability and security for opportunities to reinventthemselves and potentially achieve a greater degree of long-term economicindependence (Nakamura, 2016). The agency of these, and other, workers mustbe respected. While some have chosen sex work as a response to debt or tosupport dependents, for many, it is a deliberate rejection of alternative,minimum-salary labour in poor conditions, in favour of an industry they see as aThe Commodification of Sex 39means of advancement, either because they see a path to success within theindustry or because they seek to use it as a stepping-stone to financial independenceand the ability to pursue a different, long-term career path (SWASH, 2018)11. In allcases, the key factor must remain that the rights and welfare of the workersthemselves remain preeminent.There is a tendency for studies of sex work to incorporate secondary themes,which can be either negative (portraying the women purely as victims of a socialill) or positive (portraying the industry as an economic boon or as providing anecessary social function) (SWASH, 2018)12. While these views are all elements ofdeveloping a holistic understanding, this examination considers them secondaryto providing support for the well-being, whether economic, physical, emotional orprofessional, of the workers involved in the industry. It is also important to resistinstilling the sex industry as a whole with a motive force that would present it asexerting a causative effect on wider society. We must remember that it is widersociety that gives rise to the sex industry and which provides the demand forwhich supply will be generated. Koch (2020, p. 24) quotes a young Japanesewoman who sees her work in the industry as providing ‘essential elements’,without which, ‘lots of people would be negatively affected’, and certainly inJapanese society there are clear socio-cultural factors that are deeply connected tothe role the industry plays.It seems to be true at least that there is an increasing trend towards sexlessrelationships in Japanese society. The Japanese Family Planning Associationreported that almost half of all couples are in sexless marriages (Kitamura, 2015),with one of the key reasons given being the pressures of work (Hosokawa, 2017).Suzuki (2013, p. 330) speaks of a traditional viewpoint in Japanese societywherein men view their own wives in an almost asexual manner, while wivesconsidered extramarital sex as being tolerable, especially where it did not threatenthe family structure. While such views have no doubt altered considerably in thepresent day, studies have found that at least 14.6% of Japanese men admit tohaving used prostitutes, with higher rates among those who reported poor familyconnections or a lack of intimacy (Ui et al., 2008). The success and broad appealof the, again nominally, non-sexual elements of the sex industry – such as hostessclubs or the even more mainstream maid cafes – show that this need for intimacyis, if not as strong a factor as the desire for sexual gratification, a significantelement of Japan’s sex industry. Therefore, examination of it cannot be done withthe narrow focus on penetrative sexual intercourse that is common in manyWestern studies.Lest the sex industry be viewed in purely gendered terms, it should be madeclear that Japanese women are also perfectly capable of participating as cus-tomers of both the Mizu-Shoubai and Fuzoku worlds, if to a lesser extent.Takeyama (2020) examined middle-aged Japanese women’s pursuit of commer-cialised intimacy as a means of re-establishing their own sexual subjectivity, while11Kindle edition, Chapter 1, page 4–5.12Kindle edition, Chapter 1, page 8.40 Gavan Patrick GrayHo (2019, p. 26) described how some young, married women would form groupsto visit strip clubs, host clubs or enjoy ‘erotic massages’.The sex industry in Japan, whether considered in positive or negative terms, isclearly a significant element of Japan’s social fabric and one with considerableeconomic heft. The pertinent questions, therefore, are why, legally, it continues tobe so poorly defined and, ethically, why is continues to be so poorly regulated inregard to safeguarding the physical and psychological health of its workers.Legal and Political Views of the IndustryThe initial yūkaku, the Edo-era pleasure districts of the 1600s, were very tightlyregulated and the movement of the workers strictly controlled. This system,whereby prostitution was open and fully legal though restricted to specific areas,continued up to and through the Second World War with the state taking a directrole in the legal management of the sex trade (Lie, 1997). However, in the wake ofthe post-war Americanised systems of control, calls for criminalisation of the sexindustry became stronger. During this period the former yūkaku were reclassifiedas ‘red line’ areas within which legal prostitution could occur. There were alsoother ‘blue line’ areas that were designated as night entertainment areas (includingpresent-day Kabukichō) that were nominally ‘sex free’. However, a blurring of thelines between the two soon occurred (Kato, 2009).In 1956, after hundreds of years of tacit legal acceptance, prostitution wasfinally criminalised in the Prostitution Prevention Law on the grounds that it‘harms the dignity of the individual, is against sexual virtue and disrupts theproper morals of society’ (GoJ, 1956). However, two key factors of the law havecontinued to have a major impact on the status and nature of the sex industry inintervening years. The first is that prostitution was defined as being, ‘sexualintercourse with a non-specified person in exchange for compensation or thepromise of such’. This meant that by taking a narrow definition of ‘sexualintercourse’ to be heterosexual, genital penetration, numerous other sex acts couldremain legal. Additionally, the definition of ‘stranger’ and ‘compensation’ werevague enough that other ways to bypass these restrictions were quickly found thatmade determining whether prostitution had indeed taken place a very difficulttask. The second factor was that even where prostitution was identified, there wasno proscribed punishment. As a result, although prostitution in Japan is techni-cally illegal, a wide variety of perfectly legal stores and services exist that cater tomore narrowly defined sexual acts and any legal problems they incur will typicallybe in relation to breaches of other laws (e.g. the Customs Business Law, TheEmployment Security Law, or the Worker Dispatch Law). In such cases, they areprosecuted for crimes such as solicitation or brothel-keeping. Although specificprostitution arrests do occur, they dropped from a rate of 24,000 in the yearfollowing the establishment of the law, to 447 in 2016 (Maeda, 2018).Evidence of the decline in efforts to strictly enforce criminalisation can be seenin the role played by the ‘Women’s Guidance Centres’. Originally introduced in1958, it was intended that these reform centres would be established throughoutThe Commodification of Sex 41Japan to provide re-education and re-training of women convicted of prostitution.In practice, only one centre was created, in Akishima Tokyo, where the number of‘residents’ declined from 400 per year in the 1960s to just 4 during the 2010s, withthe expectation that it will soon be shut down permanently (Kihara, 2020). In hisanalysis of the industry, Yokohama (1995) considers the passive attitude of thosein law enforcement as having effectively decriminalised the industry, due to theirunwillingness to proactively enforce the laws to their fullest extent. The result isthat Japan is a country where prostitution is illegal, yet the government has otherlaws (GoJ, 1952) that carefully regulate the ways in which sexual services areoffered and organised on an industrial basis.This apparent dichotomy has created a situation where the definition ofprostitution, its legal standing, and the status and treatment of those working inthe sex industry remain incredibly nebulous. The question of whether sex workersshould be treated like other forms of labour under the law, with equal rights andprotections, was already being raised in the mid-1990s (Kataiki, 1996). Yet, in theintervening years, not only has little been done to clarify the issue, the precariousconditions of these workers have only been exacerbated.As previously mentioned, Japan’s sex industry is a significant employer. A2006 government study estimated more than 140,000 people whose sole profes-sion was sex work (Kadokura, 2006). For many, however, sex work is a side joband representatives of the SWASH sex workers support group estimate at least300,000 workers with almost one third of these having children (Chiba, 2020).With Japan having roughly 70 million working age adults, this would represent0.4% of this total. The number of these who are considered ‘mature’, over 26 inthe Japanese context, has been steadily increasing and now makes up half of thetotal number (Nakamura & Suzuki, 2016). For these women in particular, theprofession can be highly unstable. As is common in sex work, the older youbecome, the fewer opportunities will be available to you. Consequently, Naka-mura (2016) has collected numerous accounts of such mature women living on theedge of destitution. These include single mothers, women who have been lefthomeless, and those who had previously worked in the adult video industry butfound it increasingly difficult to acquire such work as they grew older. One of hisinterviewees, a woman he calls Yuko, recounts how her extreme poverty droveher more than once to attempted suicide. She then lists all her friends in theindustry who have died from different forms of suicide: hanging, overdose,asphyxiation, jumping in front of trains, drowning and more (Takahashi, 2018)13.During the COVID-19 pandemic, these dangers have only become more pro-nounced with suicide rates among women reaching 1.8 times more than those ofthe previous year (Konno, 2020).The increasing popularity of Social Networking Services (SNS) and theirgrowing use as a means of facilitating sexual services has also seen a shift awayfrom the traditional ‘shop’ system through which sex workers were typicallyafforded a level of management and oversight that reduced worker’s13Kindle Edition, Chapter 1, Section 8, page 3.42 Gavan Patrick Grayindependence but provided a safety net of sorts (Shibui, 2019). The unregulatednature of the sites that are used to facilitate meetings means that they are prone toexploitation by men seeking, or actively, grooming underage girls. They alsoremove any opportunity to vet unstable or violent customers, with the result thatgirls are frequently assaulted, drugged, or secretly filmed and blackmailed withthreats to release the illicit videos (Takahashi, 2018).The industry had already been experiencing a decline in its customer base dueto Japan’s ageing population and there had been hopes that foreign tourism,especially surrounding the Olympics, would counterbalance these demographicchanges, at least temporarily (Maruyama, 2014). Instead, in 2020 the oppositeoccurred, with the COVID-19 crisis seeing custom as a whole droppingdramatically and foreign tourism drying up completely. This was, of course, acommon pattern internationally as sex workers across the globe were affectedeconomically, physically and psychologically by the negative pressures of both thepandemic and the ensuing lockdowns (Platt et al., 2020).In Japan, the pandemic has especially impacted women who, compared tomen, are significantly more likely to work in part-time, contract or temporaryemployment. The rate of job loss for women in non-regular employment was 1.8times more than that of men (Zhou, 2020) and an estimated 900,000 women havebeen left substantially unemployed as a result of the crisis (Takeda, 2021). Loss ofemployment and increased levels of borrowing and resulting debt are pushingmore and more of the most vulnerable women to turn to sex work as a means ofeconomic survival at the same time as the downturn in the industry makes suchwork even more precarious and open to exploitation.In April 2020, comments by a famous Japanese comedian highlighted thecallous attitude held by many to such women when he said that the pandemiccould be seen as a good thing because it would push more pretty, young womeninto the sex industry (Shioda & Kamito, 2020). Thankfully, these commentsreceived considerable backlash. Sadly, they were merely crudely insensitive, notinaccurate, and many women have given direct accounts of how the crisis hasforced them to enter the sex industry as the only means they had of providingfor themselves, supporting their families or of repaying the debt they held(Nakamura, 2020).One indirect form of exploitation can be seen in the grey areas surroundingwhat is known as Papa Katsu (father activities), an evolution of the previous‘compensated dating’ in which young women match with potential sugar daddies,for what are supposedly non-sexual relationships. Again, it can be hard forWestern readers to imagine that such exchange could be non-sexual in nature, butmany are indeed based upon non-sexual companionship that offers emotional andsocial satisfaction. Many, of course, does not mean all, and, in the wake ofCOVID-19, there is even more leeway for young women to be exploited andpressured to provide physical services through such interactions which, conductedas they are through unmonitored and unregulated apps, make it sadly inevitablethat many vulnerable young women will fall victim to predatory older men(NHK, 2020).The Commodification of Sex 43Throughout 2020 and 2021 there were several cases of politicians beingaccused of engaging in such Papa Katsu, or visiting sex shops, and suffering acareer-ending backlash, not because of the activities themselves but because theyoccurred during the COVID-19 pandemic (Sankei, 2021; Yomiuri, 2020). In otherwords, politicians can expect to be forced to resign positions for breaking alockdown curfew but it is clear that at any other period in time, simple engage-ment in Papa Katsu or patronage of elements of the sex industry would havegenerated negligible outcry on both social and political levels. As such, one mightexpect such politicians to treat the sex industry and its workers, where they remainwithin the bounds of the law, along similar standards to any other legal business.Unfortunately for the workers involved, however, that has not been the case;although politicians are happy to make use of the services the sex industry offers,when it comes to the government determining how it should treat those workers, acertain level of hypocrisy soon becomes evident.Double Standards and Inadequate Support SystemsSex workers in Japan have long stated that even though their profession is,usually, within the boundaries of legality, they frequently face social stigmatisa-tion. This became more openly evident when, following the initial wave ofCOVID-19 infections in Japan, sex workers were excluded from a system estab-lished to support parents who were forced to leave their work due to schoolclosures (Fujisawa, 2020). Although this exclusion was soon reversed, it made itabundantly clear that there was social and political prejudice at play thatsignificantly affected not only the working conditions of those employed in theindustry but also their wider lives.Tsunehiko Maeda (2020), a former Chief Prosecutor of the Special Investi-gations Department of Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office, explains that sex workersface additional problems regarding the nature of their work status as their con-tracts are often indirect compared to those of standard office or factory workers.The wording of the Customs Business Law, which governs the legal sex industry,leaves significant room for interpretation so that workers are unclear whether theyare direct employees of stores they work at or indirect, contracted labour. Thesegrey areas have existed for decades but until the COVID-19 pandemic, there wasnever any pressure to clarify their precise nature.Now, however, pressure for a clearer definition is increasing from both rep-resentatives of the sex industry and those who oppose it. Despite the reversal onparental support, the government continued to exclude sex shops from anothersubsidy to support small businesses impacted by the pandemic and, as a result,they are being sued by at least one sex shop manager who claims that theirbusiness is being discriminated against (Osaki, 2020). The government has itssupporters though, among those who argue that the sex industry, due to perceivedties to organised crime, frequent cases of tax evasion, and, for some, the threat itrepresents to public morals, does not deserve to benefit from public taxes.Additionally, ‘abolitionists’ – who perceive the sex industry as being inherently44 Gavan Patrick Grayexploitative – hope to use the public fear of direct interaction as an opportunity tocall for greater restrictions on the industry.Prior to the beginning of the pandemic, discussions had already begun to revisethe Prostitution Prevention Law, which has remained unchanged for over 60years. While they are still ongoing, it is unlikely that they will result in a dramaticchange to the industry. So far, the focus has been upon abolishing Chapter 4 ofthe law, which introduced the aforementioned reform centres and providedgreater support for women in the industry who are in distress – whether due toage, family status, debt, violence or other problems (GoJ, 2019). While suchchanges are needed and may do considerable good, it is unlikely that the revisionswill adequately address all the problems that exist.The changes are certainly unlikely to appease the abolitionist groups andactivists who might hope to see such revisions lead to the introduction of theNordic Model of sex laws, wherein the purchase of sex, but not its sale, iscriminalised (a format which activists argue protects the agency of sex workersand reduces demand, but which many workers see as making their work less safeand more economically precarious). Such changes are incredibly unlikely to occurin Japan though, as they would upend a multi-billion-dollar industry that has adeeply entrenched position, no matter how vaguely defined, in Japanese society.Reforms to the existing law, and changes in the way in which women in theindustry are treated, are far more likely to take place on a slow and incrementalbasis which only increases the importance of understanding the various factorsthat might positively impact the lives of the women involved.One of the most important things for women in the industry is their ano-nymity. Typically, they work far from their own home areas to avoid what somecall the danger of ‘social suicide’ and the work is seen by some as a means ofaddressing economic problems without exposing their identity to public scrutiny(Sakatsume, 2018)14. Shingo Sakatsume, director of the White Hands NGO,which provides various support systems for women in the industry, including theFu-Terasu counselling service, highlighted the fact that in his own hometown theminimum hourly wage was ¥830, whereas women would expect to earn at least¥5,000–6,000 at a ‘delivery health’ store. They also have considerable flexibilityover when and for how long they are willing to work, something that appeals tostudents who might have debt, or single parents who need to provide for children.What these women lack, however, is business knowledge. Much of the advice thatFu-Terasu provides relates to issues of budgeting, contract advice and dealingwith debt or bankruptcy (Hojo, 2020).Despite having hundreds of thousands of workers, Japan’s sex industry lacksany formal union for those it employs. Since 2009, the Kyabakura Yunion(Cabaret Club Union) has acted as a subcommittee to the Friitaa Zenpan RōdōKumia (Freeter General Labour Union) to represent the interests of men andwomen in the subsidiary hostess industry but they appear to have both limitedmembership and bargaining power. Some NGOs exist to support the wider sex14Kindle edition, Chapter 4, page 9, paragraph 2.The Commodification of Sex 45work industry, with some such as White Hands offering outreach; and others,such as Nihon Fūzoku Joshi Sapōto Kyōkai (Japan Sex Workers Support Asso-ciation) and SWASH, made up of women involved in the industry themselves.The former focuses more on support for women within their workplace, while thelatter looks more at how society can change in order to provide broader supportfor the difficulties and challenges faced by sex workers. SWASH in particularseeks full decriminalisation of the sex industry, similar to what occurred in NewZealand in 2003, and argues that no policy reform should occur without firstgathering broad survey data on the opinions of officials, lawyers, researchers andsex workers (SWASH, 2018)15.Among the key targets SWASH have highlighted as being priorities for safe-guarding the welfare of the sex workers themselves are the following: (1)Improving Sexual health and prevention of STDs, (2) protection of workers’ rightto privacy, (3) reducing trouble with and danger from customers, (4) improvingwork conditions, (5) providing counselling and support for psychological prob-lems, (6) offering assistance with contractual issues and matters of economicexploitation, (7) providing assistance to address debt and other financial problems(SWASH, 2018)16.These problems are not, however, matters that require purely legal remedies;for some, a change to the law will make little difference and broader socialchanges are required in the way that people view the sex industry and the womenand men who work in it. Significant adjustments of both attitudes to and theconditions of the sex industry could result in improvements to the health, safetyand quality of life of the hundreds of thousands of people in Japan who dependupon it for their economic survival. At present, however, many misconceptionsand harmful stereotypes still remain and it is necessary to have a more open,holistic view of the industry, both good and bad, if reforms are to be properlyapplied. The sex industry is not the glamorous path to riches that it is oftenportrayed as in television dramas, nor is it a thoroughly criminal system existingonly to exploit those in poverty. To differing extents, both of these might at timesbe true but the industry is made up of many types of people with a very wide andvaried set of problems. All of them, however, suffer from some level of stigma-tisation associated with the work they are involved in. All-encompassing stereo-types that portray the whole as either victims in need of saving, or immoral,anti-social forces, do a disservice to the complexity and importance of theproblem at hand. Far more study is required that will allow policy to be shaped byexamination of the working conditions of those in the industry, the full extent ofthe problems they face and their opinions on which reforms are of most urgencyand benefit to the people directly affected by the industry’s negative factors.15Kindle edition, Chapter 6.16Kindle edition, Chapter 7.46 Gavan Patrick GrayConclusionLike any large institution, Japan’s sex industry needs to be examined in amethodical manner, its problems carefully analysed and solutions drafted in ascientific and socially responsible manner. It is without question that the industryis deeply flawed and significant poverty and exploitation does exist within it. It isalso self-evident that the economic opportunities that it provides are a vital lifelinefor many people who are living in precarious states. While the subject of sex workcan have a polarising effect on people, it is vital that extreme positions are setaside and holistic study is carried out in an academically neutral manner, guidedby empathetic concern and free from moral judgement.It is equally important to examine the industry within the context of itsnational culture and history. Japan’s value systems and cultural mores are uniqueand distinct from those of Western countries, and the modern sex industry is theproduct of a long and complex history and many waves of social and politicalinfluence. There are commonalities to be found. But to think that Western con-ceptions of ‘pimps’, ‘brothels’, ‘prostitutes’ and ‘selling sex’ translate directly intoJapanese language or thought in the same way they do in other countries, displaysa lack of cultural awareness that will hamper effective responses to the issuesthat exist.In one way, however, the fact that that the sex industry in Japan is such anopen part of the social fabric and that it already enjoys a certain legal statusmeans that the potential exists for reforms to be enacted in a broader and morecomplete way than in countries where the status of the sex industry is publicly andlegally far more opaque. If political will is sufficiently harnessed, and the prob-lems of the industry given the necessary level of study and analysis, the potentialexists for Japanese reforms to act as a model for the ethical and effectiverestructuring of the sex industry in ways that safeguard the welfare, rights andagency of those involved. To do so though, the requisite first step will be to adjustpolitical and public attitudes to prioritise the needs of the industry’s workers overthe services that they provide.ReferencesAllison, A.

NHK.50 Gavan Patrick GrayChapter 3Sexual Orientation Microaggressions inSouth AfricaDeepesh Nirmaldas DayalAbstractDiscrimination against LGBTQ1 people in South Africa has shifted fromovert hate crimes to covert microaggressions. Microaggression is a term usedin psychology to describe casual discrimination against socially marginalisedgroups, and they occur in three forms: microassaults, microinsults andmicroinvalidations. Microassaults include verbal and non-verbal discrimi-natory behaviours. Microinsults include actions or statements which demeana person’s identity, and microinvalidations negate the thoughts, feelings orlived experiences of a certain people. Microaggressions have detrimentalimpacts on lives of people experiencing them and on their interpersonalrelationships. The chapter presents a focus on microaggression theorytogether with microaggression experiences of South African Indian LGBTQ1people, who have been under-researched. Reference is made to interviewextracts from research studies focusing on South African Indian LGBTQ1people and from e-zine articles focusing on the experiences of South AfricanIndian LGBTQ1 people.Keywords: South African Indian; LGBTQ1; microaggressions; covertdiscrimination; mental health; homophobiaSouth African lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people as well aspeople who otherwise identify with minority labels for sexual orientation andgender identities (LGBTQ1) face violence, discrimination and oppression despitethe presence of legal protections in South Africa (Marais, Nel, & Govender,2022).

The experiences of ethnicand religious minority people in South Africa, such as LGBTQ1 people of Indiandescent, also differ greatly from the promise offered by the unwavering Consti-tutional protection for gender and sexuality minorities (Khan, 2017).Amongst South Africans of Indian descent, conservative values, patriarchy,religious beliefs and collectivist living are linked to the discrimination experi-ences of LGBTQ1 people (Khan, 2017; Pillay, 2017). In previous researchfindings of the author (Dayal, 2021), who conducted a recent study on the sexualorientation discrimination experiences of South African gay Indian men, it isidentified that the discrimination against LGBTQ1 people within the SouthAfrican Indian community is also covert in nature. This covert form ofdiscrimination is known as sexual orientation microaggressions. Micro-aggressions can occur in several forms, and their intention is to mock, demeanand negate the lived experiences of LGBTQ1 people (Nadal, 2013). Thesemicroaggressions are written about by many journalists in news articles (Akoob,2018; Igual, 2018; Jagmohan, 2017; Khan, 2017, 2018; Pillay, 2017). Thischapter aims to uncover the foundations of microaggression theory, and howSouth African Indian LGBTQ1 people are affected by sexual orientationmicroaggressions. Some quotes and ideas from research studies and opinionpieces will be integrated with microaggression theory in order to make sense ofthe experiences of South African Indian LGBTQ1 men.LGBTQ1 People’s Experiences in South AfricaA landmark move in 2006 led to South Africa becoming one of the first countriesin the world to introduce legislation that prevents the discrimination of citizensbased on their sexual orientation (Bhana, 2012). These legislations allow forsame-sex marriages, the ability of same-sex couples to adopt, and legal rights forsame-sex couples to inherit from each other (Thoreson, 2008). Despite theseadvanced laws, LGBTQ1 people in South Africa face relentless discriminationand high rates of violence (OUT, 2016). This discrimination, being either overt orcovert, happens across many different settings: schools, healthcare, governmentoffices, workplaces, police stations and higher education institutions (Francis,2017; Soeker et al., 2015). South African LGBTQ1 people therefore straddleworlds of protection and persecution. There are many factors which contribute tothis condemnation, and the chapter on intersectional discrimination later in thisvolume will allow for a closer inspection of these intersectional influences.The public views on same-sex relationships in South Africa continue tooscillate between acceptance and rejection. Empirical research conducted by theHuman Sciences Research Council in South Africa, titled: Progressive Prudes: A52 Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalSurvey of South African Attitudes to Homosexuality and Gender Non-Conformity,revealed that of the 3,000 participants, 72% of people had a firm belief thatsame-sex relationships were morally wrong (Sutherland, Roberts, Gabriel, Stru-wig, & Gordon, 2016). Also, 70% of the participants found same-sex sexualinteractions to be wrong and disgusting. Two fifths of respondents in anotherstudy by Mahomed and Trangoš (2016) found identifying as gay as being againstcommunity values. In this study, some 12% of respondents approved of hatecrimes as a response to gay men. The ‘Love Not Hate’ (2016) survey revealed arise in negative attitudes towards LGBTQ1 people, where 14% of South Africansagreed to violence against LGBTQ1 people; and the percentage of respondentswho believed in equal rights for LGBTQ1 people fell from 71% in 2013 to only56% in 2015. These startling figures paint a bleak picture of the levels of accep-tance of LGBTQ1 people in South Africa. Currently, there are organisations inSouth Africa that cater to the needs of LGBTQ1 people who face the challenges,and new legislation aimed to protect LGBTQ1 people against hate crimes con-tinues to be passed. But these may not be enough to change public perceptions ofLGBTQ1 people. The experiences of LGBTQ1 people of Indian descent inSouth Africa mirrors those of other communities in South Africa; however, thereare some unique cultural influences which will be discussed next (Khan, 2017).LGBTQ1 People in Indian CommunitiesDue to the cultural similarities between the people of Indian descent in SouthAfrica and people of Indian descent in other countries, this section will discussstudies of LGBTQ1 people of Indian descent in the United Kingdom, India andlastly South Africa. An attempt will be made to integrate some direct quotationsfrom studies in order to demonstrate the ideas and thoughts surrounding some ofthe experiences of LGBTQ1 people.Despite the global presence of the Indian diaspora, most of the research onLGBTQ1 people of Indian descent has been conducted in India and the UnitedKingdom. These studies show that LGBTQ1 Indians experience prejudice anddiscrimination based on their gender identity and sexual orientation. Thisdiscrimination is perpetrated in many different settings and often by people inpersonal relationships with the victims, such as family members, employers,friends, and members of the schooling and healthcare sectors who are close toLGBTQ1 people (Bhugra, 1997a, 1997b; Jaspal, 2012, 2014; Kar, Mukherjee,Ventriglio, & Bhugra, 2018; Sharma & Subramanyam, 2020). The following twoquotes from two gay men from a large study by Sharma and Subramanyam(2020) in India reveal the difficulties that are present within societies in India.They noted:It was suffocating for me to suppress my sexual desires during mychildhood because of society. It made me have a distaste for sexualSexual Orientation Microaggressions 53things. I remained isolated sexually for years and suppressed thesefeelings.(Sharma & Subramanyam, p. 10)I was extremely uncomfortable, partly because back then it wasnot accepted socially and culturally. There was no politicalcorrectness, and homophobia was extreme, which made me moreuncomfortable with my sexuality. I realized that I am gay when Iwas in 11th but could not accept it. There was no support system. Iconsidered it to be socially and politically incorrect.(Sharma & Subramanyam, p. 9)These participants share how concealing their identities made them feel iso-lated and unsupported. Gay men experience internalised homophobia andemotional challenges due to stigmatisation within Indian communities. Psycho-logical challenges are further alluded to in a study in the United Kingdom (Jaspal,2012), where a British Indian gay man reveals:Everyday being gay is like getting harder for me because I can justsee it in my head – mum is crying, dad is crying too and like justthinking ‘he can’t be my son’ and my brothers would be likefreaking out that I’m queer.(Jaspal, 2012, p. 773)According to studies conducted in India and the United Kingdom, discrimi-nation is linked to conservative community values, family honour, culturalpractices, hegemonic masculinity, patriarchy and heterosexism (Bhugra, 1997a,1997b; McKeown, Nelson, Anderson, Low, & Elford, 2010; Mimiaga et al., 2013;Sharma & Subramanyam, 2020). There have been many efforts by rights groupsand LGBTQ1 organisations in India and the United Kingdom. However, talkabout LGBTQ1 identities remains taboo and a challenging conversation to havewithin Indian communities (Bhugra, 1997a, 1997b; Jain, 2015; Jaspal, 2012).Discrimination is further perpetuated through Indian media, in particular withinBollywood movies, where gay men are portrayed in foolish roles involving comicrelief (Kaur, 2017). All these societal restraints have led to some gay men beingsubjected to corrective therapy practices, where they are taken to psychiatrists inorder to be ‘cured’ of same-sex attraction (Bhugra, 1997a; Jain, 2015).Difficulties Experienced by LGBTQ1 People of Indian Descentin South AfricaSouth African Indian people constitute 2.6% of the South African population(Statistics South Africa, 2020). Although South African Indian people are quitevisible within South Africa, there have been very limited studies which have54 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayalfocused on the experiences of South African LGBTQ1 people (Pillay, 2017).Even fewer studies have selected the accounts of LGBTQ1 Indian people as aresearch focus. Most of the research that has been done has been in the form ofgraduate studies dissertations. The little research that has been conductedfocusing on LGBTQ1 people of Indian descent in South Africa, such as that byBonthuys and Erlank (2012), Dave (2011), Dayal (2021), Moonsammy (2009) andNair (2020), reveals that LGBTQ1 people in South Africa do experiencediscrimination related to the expression of sexual orientation within the Indiancommunities.Studies focusing on the ‘coming out’ experiences of lesbian women and gaymen emphasised the ideologies related to heterosexism, stereotypical gender roles,community values, religious beliefs and conservative attitudes (Dave, 2011; Nair,2020). Community beliefs would mostly be centred on concerns about appeasingthe community and abiding by the rules and regulations set out by the community(Dayal, 2021; Moonsammy, 2009). As a participant in Dayal’s (2021) studyconfirms:So particularly when coming out was things said [people from thecommunity to participant’s mother], ‘Do you know that your sonis doing this, this is not accepted, it’s not part of our culture.How’re you going to show your face within the community? This isa bad example for our children’. Those kinds of things affect justnot only yourself, but your family as well. ‘What will people say?What do people say?’(Dayal, 2021, p. 70)The gay man in Dayal’s (2021) study was made to believe that identifying asgay is wrong and that gay men follow lifestyles that are against cultural norms.The notion of family honour is seen as being deeply negatively affected by havingfamily members who identify with sexual orientations that are not accepted.Family and community members find it difficult to accept LGBTQ1 people andthere are often utterances that identifying as LGBTQ1 is a choice or a ‘phase’and that it can be changed. These were noted in many studies, as highlighted bythese selected quotes:Like I brought it up to my mom once that I like chicks and guys,and she was like oh my god you’re just going through a phase. The‘you’re going through a phase’ quote is a thing that is just going toappear on my skin one day, I’ve heard it so often.(Nair, 2020, p. 58)I told my sisters one by one. The first one I told when I was about18 and she was actually completely fine with it. I did have aproblem with my eldest sister who didn’t wanna accept it, sheSexual Orientation Microaggressions 55said it was a phase that I was going through and that I’ll grow outof it.(Dave, 2011, p. 20)She [participant’s mother] actually went very quiet, and sheactually said, ‘Can you not try to not be gay?’ And I told her,‘Can you try to grow an arm?’ And she said, ‘No!’ And then I said,‘Well that’s like asking me to not be gay’. And she said, ‘No, it’snot the same’. I’m like, ‘Yes it is the same’.(Dayal, 2021, p. 66)What can be concluded is that the family members of the participants in thesestudies were adamant about the fact that they believed that identifying asLGBTQ1 was a choice and that there was pressure placed on the participants tochange. These LGBTQ1 people also feared hostility from family members whodid not accept them (Moonsammy, 2009). The reasons behind the non-acceptanceof LGBTQ1 people are varied. However, some key ideas revealed from researchstudies are that conservatism, traditional beliefs and fixed gender roles are oftenused as anchors to discriminate against anyone who behaves in a way that is inopposition to these fixed ideas (Dayal, 2021; Nair, 2020). This will be discussed ina later chapter.MicroaggressionsIn research findings and opinion articles, it is commonly understood that thediscrimination against LGBTQ1 people of Indian descent in South Africa ismainly covert in nature (Akoob, 2018; Dave, 2011; Igual, 2018; Jagmohan, 2017;Khan, 2017, 2018; Pillay, 2017). The fact that the violence is overt, not covert,may be due to the legal protections offered to LGBTQ1 people in South Africa.Still, the people who commit these microaggressions are labelled as ‘perpetrators’,and they commit verbal and non-verbal homonegative acts of discriminationagainst LGBTQ1 people (Sue et al., 2007).Microaggression theory was first presented by Pierce, Carew, Pierce-Gonzalez,and Willis (1978), who defined microaggressions as ‘subtle, stunning, generallyautomatic and nonverbal “put-downs” of Black people by offenders’ (p. 66). Thisdefinition of microaggressions has been extended to sexual orientation micro-aggressions, which affect people who define themselves by different sexual ori-entations. These sexual orientation microaggressions often start early in the livesof LGBTQ1 people. Initially, these sexual orientation microaggressions beginwith the implementation of traditional gender roles (Francis & Reygan, 2016).Within society, gender usually begins with the identification of biological sex. Sexassigned at birth is defined as a person being born as male, female or intersexbased on the appearance of genital organs at birth, whereas gender identity is aperson’s sense of identifying as male, female, both, or neither, or another gender.56 Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalSociety, however, commonly defines gender within the binaries of masculinity formales, and femininity for females (Beasley, 2005). This classification based ongender, and the equation of gender and sex, is criticised, as it presents a verynarrow view on gender.Judith Butler has famously offered a critique of this narrow definition, andargues that gender should be understood, rather, as a repetition of certain actsover a period of time (Butler, 1990). These acts are passed down from one gen-eration to the next. Gender can be expressed free of binaries (Butler, 1990);however, within society, pre-existing ‘traditional gender roles’ legitimise genderbinaries, reinforcing beliefs that men are supposed to be strong, dominant andunemotional; and women emotional and submissive. Early microaggressionaccounts begin when younger children express their gender differently to whatsociety dictates (Eliot, 2009; Francis, 2012, 2017). For example, a young boy whoenjoys toys that are usually reserved for young girls will be assumed to be gay anddiscriminated against. In this way, gender expression becomes linked to sexualorientation, before an individual even decides who they are attracted toromantically.These sexual orientation microaggressions have been summarised by Sue(2010) and Nadal, Rivera, and Corpus (2010) into a taxonomy which allows us tocategorise sexual orientation microaggressions. Some of the categories are quitesimilar. The first category, ‘use of heterosexist or transphobic terminology’ makesreference to utterances that demean LGBTQ1 people. The second category,‘endorsement of heteronormative or gender normative culture and behaviours’signifies the pressure that LGBTQ1 people face to behave in ways that endorsecisgenderism. ‘Assumption of sexual pathology/abnormality’ refers to theportrayal of LGBTQ1 people as being sexually deviant. The category ‘denial ofreality of heterosexism or transphobia’ looks at how people who commit sexualorientation microaggressions may not be aware of the bias associated with theircomments. ‘Sinfulness’ and ‘assumption of abnormality’ are two other themeswhich highlight that identifying as LGBTQ1 is associated with committing a sin,and is also seen as being unnatural. Finally, the last two categories of ‘denial ofheterosexism’ and ‘endorsement of heteronormativity’ involves people that denyLGBTQ1 bias, and those who place an over-importance on heteronormativeattitudes and behaviours. An additional category of the taxonomy presented byNadal et al. (2010) is the category of ‘exoticisation’, where LGBTQ1 people areobjectified. This may be linked to Sue’s (2010) theme of ‘over-sexualisation’,where LGBTQ1 people are identified as being overly sexual beings by hetero-sexual people. Another theme signalled by Nadal et al. (2010) is that of the‘assumption of universal LGBT experience’, where LGBTQ1 people are assumedto all experience their sexual orientation in the same way. Some of these themeswill be practically illustrated with excerpts from research studies and e-zinearticles.Sexual Orientation Microaggressions 57Types of Microaggresions and Outcomes of MicroaggressionsThere are characteristically three types of microaggressions: microassaults,microinsults and microinvalidations (Nadal et al., 2011; Sue et al., 2007).Microassaults occur at interpersonal and environmental levels, and they may beseen to be similar to overt discrimination. They are direct actions that are aimedat demeaning recipients of these microaggressions. They can also be overt acts ofnon-acceptance, such as a gay man being refused service at a restaurant or signsthat are anti-LGBTQ1. The use of derogatory words against South AfricanIndian LGBTQ1 people is identified in some studies. In studies by Dayal (2021)and Nair (2020), the following was revealed by participants:They would use words like ‘moffie’ you know these types of…Basically it reflected that the greater part of society made fun of.They found gay people to be um a part of society that wediscourage, that we make fun of, that they’re a point of humour[nods head]. And that’s on the outside of things. At the inside of it,gay people weren’t [shakes head] accepted or encouraged to be gayor encouraged to be themselves or be true to themselves. It wasvery very [sniffs] strongly established and maintained that it’s notacceptable, and there’s no place for people like that.(Dayal, 2021, p. 60)I couldn’t really understand this, but there was this attached levelof shame and guilt from that point to why am I feeling this? Andattempting to make sense of it because words like ‘moffie’ and‘faggot’ were those words that the boys all around me wouldalways use … that if you are not a boy, that’s liking girls thenyou are a ‘moffie’. If you are a boy taking part in a speech contestor in plays in school, then you are a ‘moffie’ – that was assigned tome from primary school.(Nair, 2020, p. 54)‘Moffie’ is a derogatory word that is used to describe men who are seen aseffeminate (Malan & Johaardien, 2010). Effeminacy is tied to ‘individuals [who]appear to fall short of a more aggressive, masculine ideal’ (Holmes & Meyerhoff,2003, p. 406). These effeminate men are seen to oppose traditional gender rolesand are often discriminated against. It was discovered that the word is frequentlyused in South Africa school settings when younger boys discriminate against theirpeers (Cilliers, 2017; Msibi, 2011).‘Faggot’ is another word used to make derogatory reference to gay men. In anincident of cyber bullying, Naufal Khan (2018), the publisher of Indian Spicee-zine, was told that he is ‘A faggot with a mouth’ (Khan, 2018). The perpetrator,with the knowledge that Naufal Khan is an openly gay man, called him a ‘faggot’in response to an article that he had written. What is alarming is that there is an58 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayalinsinuation that gay men are supposed to be invisible, and should not ‘have amouth’. This further reflects the discrimination faced by gay men and the silencethat they suffer within the South African Indian community.Another type of microaggressions are microinvalidations. These types ofmicroaggressions are typically more difficult to categorise as they are verbal ornon-verbal messages that are usually subconscious or subtle in nature (Nadalet al., 2011). Microinvalidations negate the experiences of LGBTQ1 people, andthey are deeply rooted in societal biases and social norms. An example ofmicroinvalidations are instances when gay men are told that what they are goingthrough is a phase or when the difficulties of a gay person are not spoken about byfamily members, and instead are simply ignored. In an article by Igual (2018), aSouth African movie about members of the South African Indian community isreviewed. In this review, discrimination against gay men is noted, where the uncleof one of the gay characters gives the gay man heterosexual porn in an attempt toassist him in becoming ‘straight’. Igual writes: ‘He [uncle] also hands him [gaycharacter] a package of heterosexual porn claiming that watching it will turn agay person straight’ (Igual, 2018). The direct link to porn is also a micro-aggression on a second level linked to the over-sexualisation of gay men, wheregay men are seen to have an unnatural interest in sex and sexual practices (Sue,2010).In an online blog on the experience of coming out by a South African mediapersonality of Indian descent (Vagar, 2020), it is shared that due to strong link-ages to family honour in the South African Indian community, often talks aroundsexuality are concealed. He reveals:Hardwired into the Indian value-system, for example is a social orcultural code known as ‘izzat’, which can be translated to refer toeverything from family honour, reputation and prestige to anindividual’s personal dignity. Similar to the concept of ‘savingface’ that is core to a lot of Asian cultures, the notion of izzatsounds like a pretty noble and decorous aspiration on paper, but ithas a decidedly dark downside. As an unintended consequence, italso engenders a culture of ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ behaviour thatresults in people concealing, suppressing or obfuscating the truth –or worse yet, simply denying its existence. As a result, importantconversations are seldom had or ever brought up, difficultsituations and pressing issues are left unaddressed and therefore,unresolved – and inconvenient truths and problems are just wishedaway or swept under the rug.(Vagar, 2020)Another participant in Nair’s (2020) study expressed that during the ‘comingout’ experience, there was a large amount of avoidance and secrecy surroundingtalk around sexuality.Sexual Orientation Microaggressions 59Big sense of avoidance. Indians don’t talk about things. It’s sweptunder the carpet and bubbles up and bites …Very toxic, and aswell it’s a big thing they have to adjust to, and every otheremotional response following that to any emotional issues isinevitably informed by that toxicity of not addressing theproblem at hand … So, it’s just like, Indian families in generalare very invasive and there’s no boundaries and I have toaccommodate that.(Nair, 2020, p. 67)A South African Indian gay man in the study by Dayal (2021) also revealedthat his identity as a gay man was negated and denied. During his coming outexperience, his mother ‘assumed sexual pathology and abnormality’ (Sue, 2010)and made reference to him seeking a cure to become ‘normal’.I can remember about my mum is that when I came out to her, shewas quite compassionate. Almost too compassionate to the pointof saying, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll take you for healing and find a curefor you. We’ll make sure you get better’. Kind of you knowtreating me as somebody that’s unwell or mentally infirm.(Dayal, 2021, p. 66)All these experiences reveal a deeply rooted rejection of LGBTQ1 identities,where LGBTQ1 people are seen to not receive the necessary support from theirfriends, family and community. Their lived realities of identifying as LGBTQ1and the challenges that arise due to this are not acknowledged. Furthermore, whatthey experience when speaking about their experiences makes them feel worse anddiscriminated against.Microinsults are the final type of microaggressions. They include ‘statementsor actions that indirectly belittle a person and are often unconscious and unin-tentional’ (Nadal, 2008, p. 22). Microinsults contain ‘communications thatconvey stereotypes, rudeness and insensitivity and that demean a person’s sexualorientation’ (Sue, 2010, p. 31). These are reflected in the following extracts fromDayal’s (2021) study where a gay man is subjected to being given gifts meant for awoman at a party. And there are also references made at his workplace to himowning a certain type of car, which is often stereotyped as being a car owned bygay men:At a Christmas party, we had this secret Santa theme, where wedrew people’s names and we didn’t know who was going to buy usa gift. And the gift I received turned out to be a pair of bras. Whichwas very embarrassing. Because we had to open our gifts in frontof everybody, and they laughed.(Dayal, 2021, p. 87)60 Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalThe other thing was my manager made a comment saying[participant] is a [type of hybrid car] kind of a guy. I knew whathe was trying to insinuate. Because it’s mostly gay people thatdrive cars like that.(Dayal, 2021, p. 87)These messages display unconscious or possibly unintentional ways in whichpeople commit microaggressions against gay men. These messages may be seen asharmless by the perpetrators of microaggressions but they cause harm andunsettling feelings to those who are recipients of these microaggressions.Another microinsult is found in the online article by Igual (2018), where hecomments on a discriminatory scene in a South African movie relating to a SouthAfrican Indian community. Within the movie, a dominant male character makeshand gestures relating to sex between two men. His gesture suggests:Heterosexual sex is compared to a train going into a tunnel whilegay sex is depicted as unnatural and compared to a trainapproaching another train, which will lead to a crash.(Igual, 2018)Sex between two men is therefore portrayed as unnatural and is poked fun at.This may be seen as an act of comic relief by the perpetrator; however, the personat the receiving end of the microaggression does not receive it in the same way.After outlining the different types of microaggressions, what becomes evidentis that only one of them, microassaults, is seen as an overt form of micro-aggression, whereas microinvalidations and microinsults are unconscious acts ofdiscrimination that negatively impact the recipients of microaggressions.Unconscious acts are often difficult to identify and to comment on, as they areexperienced very differently by different recipients based on their subjectivebackgrounds. Microaggressions lead to minority stress experiences: LGBTQ1people experience debilitating responses to distressing events, which may causethem great discomfort in their interpersonal and work lives (Dayal, 2021).ConclusionThis chapter provides greater insight into the lives of LGBTQ1 people of Indiandescent who reside in South Africa. The discrimination experienced by theseLGBTQ1 people is mostly covert in nature, and these acts of discrimination areknown as microaggressions. Microaggression theory and the practical catego-risation of the types of microaggressions were carefully unpacked in this chapter.These microaggressions create unpleasant environments and interactions forLGBTQ1 people and measures need to be instated to protect LGBTQ1 peopleagainst these discriminatory acts. Though ‘violence’ is often seen as somethingphysical and overt – and is both constitutionally illegal and actively persecuted inSouth Africa – microaggressions, as I’ve shown here, constitute forms of sexualSexual Orientation Microaggressions 61and gendered violence that have the potential to harm their recipients and shouldtherefore not be overlooked in any academic, legal, therapeutic or culturalcontext.ReferencesAkoob, R.

As with the previous introductory dialogue,the discussion takes place after preliminary drafts had been completed, andthe authors share their thoughts on the subjects they will each discuss inmore detail in the following chapters. These include the impact of culturaland gender bias within the Indian legal system, the insufficient impact oflong-overdue reforms in Japan’s sexual violence laws and the weaknessesthat exist in constitutional protections offered to LGBTQ1 people in SouthAfrica.Keywords: Gender violence; law; legal reform; Japan; India; South AfricaGray: In the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap rankings for 2020,South Africa does quite well in 17th place. India fares far worse at 112th.However, Japan sits at 120 and there is little reason, on paper, for this to be thecase. I mentioned previously that the United States had a strong role in addingwomen’s rights to the post-war constitution and this set the framework for asystem where women, in theory, have considerable room for advancement withinsocial institutions. In practice, the outcomes are far different and while some ofthe reasons for this can be explained by the male dominance of these institutions,Gender Violence, the Law, and Society, 69–77Copyright © 2022 Gavan Patrick Gray, Nidhi Shrivastava and Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

While thingstoday are certainly not perfect, they are an improvement on the attitudes thatexisted in the time of the current generation’s great-grandparents. Yet, many lawswhich have a strong impact on women’s lives date from this period. When itcomes to South Africa and India, I am sure there are similar problems in thepresent day, but in the case of legal standards are the laws more modern, in thesense that they were either drafted recently or are subject to regular revision orupdate, or are they more akin to Japan, where in 2017 the laws on sexual violencereceived their first significant revision in 100 years?Shrivastava: That’s a good question, Gavan. Indian rape laws are rooted incolonial laws dated back to the time when India was colonised for 200 years. Thetreatment of rape victim-survivor during court trials, where the defence lawyersprod through a woman’s sexual history, are practices that date back to thisperiod. In fact, to this day, a hundred-year-old book by Jaising Modi on juris-prudence and rape called Medical Jurisprudence and Technology is considered alaw bible in India. During the research for the coming chapter, I looked it up andit was still in print in India. Students were praising the work, without realisingthat it is problematic in terms of the practices the author encourages. Forexample, Modi problematically assumes that if a woman is a virgin, she is of a‘good character’. Thus, it is more likely that her rape happened, and her testimonycan be trusted. Elizabeth Kolsky mentions in her research the case of King vs.Patha Kala from the early twentieth century, where a young woman named Viruwas raped by someone from a lower caste. Feeling shameful, Viru attempted tocommit suicide by jumping into the well. The judge in this case, punished PathaKala by sentencing him to four years of imprisonment. Kolsky observes thatalthough Viru was not on trial, the trial was about her because her non-consent,her appearance and caste, and her sexual history took centre stage. Because shefought back and later tried to ‘save her honour’ by attempting to kill herself, shebecame a model for defining a ‘good’ rape victim. Years later, in 1972, during theMathura rape case –Mathura had been raped by two policemen – even the IndianSupreme Court refused to believe her because they doubted her character.Gray: This goes back to the treatment of women in the sex industry I exploredin my first chapter. So much apathy, and failure to provide protection or support,is excused based upon attacks on the character or moral quality of the womeninvolved.Shrivastava: Exactly. Of course, there is pressure for change and feministorganisations and lawyers have advocated for the courts to give more credence tothe testimony of rape survivors. Yet, changes that occurred in 1983 were dis-missed by many of these groups as purely symbolic. After an infamous gang-rapecase in Delhi in 2012, there was another wave of pressure from scholars and thisfinally led to the 2013 amendments of rape laws. Some of the noticeable changeswere that the legal term for ‘rape’ changed to ‘sexual assault’ to include different70 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.types of sexual offences including penetration by objects, as happened during the2012 rape case. The government also established a Nirbaya fund to help empowerand provide resources to rape victim-survivors. Even so, sexist, patriarchal andoften misogynistic attitudes towards rape victim-survivors are still quitewidespread.Gray: When it comes to legal punishments, the Japanese system can veer fromexcessively harsh to overly lenient without any seeming common standards as towhat determines the severity. In actuality, the set punishments are clearly definedby fairly rigid laws that leave quite wide ranges for possible sentences. Murder, forexample can result in sentences of from 5 to 20 years, or in extreme cases, thedeath penalty. This leaves a lot of leeway for judicial discretion, but in practice,the actual punishment will be strongly affected by precedents that take intoaccount things like remorse, motive, apologies, settlement payments, theoffender’s age and character etc. In the same way, the treatment of violent sexualcrime is often handled in a formal, by-rote manner that focuses on precedent andestablished standards rather than the specifics of each individual case and theimpact the events have on the actual people involved.The Japanese courts, in my view, have become, or perhaps always were, a verycold, bureaucratic system in which true justice takes a back seat to ‘proper pro-cedure’. One unfortunate outcome of this is that the system as it is currentlyapplied often allows offenders to evade formal punishment by reaching out-of-court settlements with victims. It’s a system that I feel, in the case of crimes ofsexual violence, does too little to generate true justice for the victim, adequatelypunish offenders, or maintain the safety of the general public. It is improving but,at present, if I were to hear of an incident of sexual violence, I would not holdhigh hopes that the offender, even after being identified, would be properlypunished by Japanese courts. Do you think that standards or procedures aresignificantly different in either South Africa or India? In other words, do youthink that offenders in sex crimes, once they have been identified by the police orcourt, are more likely than not to receive a custodial sentence?Dayal: If I can address that Gavan, there is quite a disparity in South Africabetween what the legal system enshrines versus what the lived realities of citizensare. Because of my research interest, I will use an example that focuses on theexperience of LGBTQ1 groups. In 1994, South Africans from all racial groupshelped give birth to a new democracy that was meant to allow freedom, equality,social justice and opportunities for all. Due to this, South Africa has often beenpresented as a regional model for hope, social rebirth and democracy. However,today, more than two decades post-democracy, a paradox exists where, despitenumerous policies and legislation guaranteeing the preservation of human rights,there are still significant levels of crime and human rights violations.For example, the new South African Constitution marked it as one of the firstcountries in the world to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity andsexual orientation. There are also provisions for same-sex partners to marry,adopt and be legally recognised in deceased estates. Yet, as was discussed in thefirst section of this book, even when things seem to be moving in a progressivedirection, deep flaws can remain and LGBTQ1 individuals in South Africa stillSection II: Gender-Based Violence 71experience high rates of overt and covert violence. They can be said to straddletwo worlds, one with intricate legal protections and another of continuing, oftenhidden, persecution. Part of the persistence of this problem can be attributed tothe ‘un-African’ label that is assigned to LGBTQ1 individuals and the dominantthemes of conservative community values, heteronormativity, heterosexism andpatriarchy in South African societies. Gavan, I am wondering what the reper-cussions of sexual violence in Japan are?Gray: Japan also has a somewhat deserved reputation for entrenched sexism,which many write off as misogyny. In my personal experience, this is not true atthe broader level. There are certainly many misogynists and some of them rise tohigh positions where their public gaffs can create an impression that Japan’spolitical system is still completely unconcerned with the welfare of women. Inpractice though, I find that most Japanese men, whether young or old, have thebasic level of concern for the welfare of all social groups that you would expectfrom a society that places such strong emphasis on egalitarianism and socialharmony.The problem, from my perspective, is that very few have a strong knowledge ofthe actual problems which women face, both in terms of their awareness of theextent of the problems that exist and their understanding of the way that theseproblems affect women. For example, in regard to sexual violence, many maythink that rape is terrible but they might consider it as not being very common,considerably underestimating its rate of occurrence. Then, in terms of impact,they may view it as a crime of violence and consider that arrest and punishment ofperpetrators is sufficient, believing the fact that Japan has strong laws againstsuch offences will be enough to resolve the problem. Their lack of awareness ofthe flaws in the system, or the way in which the system itself can harm victims,does not mean they do not care; many Japanese men, I would say the greatmajority, find sexual violence against women utterly abhorrent but they arefrequently lacking awareness of the scope, severity and impact of the problem.What this means is that there is a fundamental problem in terms of under-standing and education and that public attitudes to such issues have not yetcaught up with what experts, activists and the victims themselves know about thesubject. I’m curious whether general awareness levels and education about sexualviolence and its impact on victims are widespread in Indian and South Africaninstitutions, especially among the police and courts, and also in systems likehospitals.Shrivastava: Yes, there is definitely a need for deep, structural change in theIndian law enforcement system. In fact, rape survivor-victims are often hesitant tofile First Information Reports (FIRs) because they are discouraged by the policeofficers themselves. The police in India are often viewed as corrupt and bureau-cratic and as holding entrenched patriarchal and misogynistic attitudes. Imentioned the Mathura rape case earlier, and it was only the response to this thatsaw ‘custodial rape’ – in other words: sexual assault by police or jailers – as beinga punishable crime, and this only happened in 1983. There are female policeofficers but even in popular culture, they are portrayed as unsupportive andcorrupt.72 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.Gray: Do you think there is room to improve this issue through greatertraining and awareness? Personally, I had initially thought that increasing thenumber of women involved directly in each element of the system was the way togo. However, when looking at the level of female representation in the police Iwas left wondering whether this is necessarily true. In Japan, only 10% of policeofficers are female and I thought this was terribly low, especially when youcompare it with places like England and Wales where the level is over 30%. I wassurprised to learn, though, that the level in the United States is only about 12%and, while this may be a problem, the United States still leads the field in manyareas of responding to sexual violence.One other factor that influenced my views is that there is sometimes amisconception that female victims of sexual violence will prefer to deal withfemale officers. In some cases, this is not true, and the victims prefer male officerswho give them a greater sense of physical security. According to some experts, it isnot the gender that is most important but rather the training the responders havereceived and, ideally, the use of non-police experts in forensic interviewing skills.Dayal: Gavan, I think it is true that deeper reforms are required. As you said,the system itself can be very cold, impersonal and unsupportive. The objective of acriminal justice system is to ensure that criminal cases are processed speedily andthat lawbreakers are handed appropriate punishments. But, in the case of SouthAfrica, the criminal justice system has not been operating optimally. The Victimsof Crime Surveys in South Africa for many years keeps revealing concerningstatistics that show household satisfaction with the courts and the criminal justicesystem is constantly decreasing. Many households believe that the courts are toolenient on criminals when passing sentences, that court proceedings take far toolong and the people who are at the receiving end of discrimination and violencesuffer even more due to this. People lose trust in the legal system and this leads toa decease in crime reporting because people who are affected by crimes, who areoften part of a marginalised group, feel that their reports will not be given theattention they deserve. Some members of society also fear that they may expe-rience secondary victimisation if they report crimes.Shrivastava: I think, Gavan, you make a great point about if training andeducation can change/help with the issue of gender-based violence. However,while I do think they are great starting points for India, I believe that it will takere-learning of certain cultural attitudes and letting go of problematic ideologiessuch as favouring boys over girls, the reduction in the statistics of female infan-ticide and also acceptance of women’s education and freedom to travel in publicspace that will reduce gender-based violence in India. India as a country ismulti-layered, multi-religious and also shaped by the class and caste issues thatshape it. Therefore, I think the solution to reduce gender-based violence will haveto come from different avenues working together to change cultural attitudes inthe country.In the film, Damini, which I explore in this chapter, for example, the maincharacter witnesses and reports the gang rape of a family servant by some of herrelatives. She ends up having to fight against not just the perpetrators but corruptpolice officers, biased lawyers and an uncaring legal system. Although she isSection II: Gender-Based Violence 73ultimately successful, we kind of see that it is the main character who has beenleading this fight, not the victim herself, who is actually murdered and discarded,both physically and metaphorically, halfway through the movie. In one way thishighlights a troubling fact that often the activists and reform-minded lawyers havemore influence than the actual victims of these crimes. Is this something you see ineither Japan or South Africa?Gray: Well, in Japan most of the women who work in the sex industry tend tocome from economically fragile groups. They are from small rural towns with feweconomic opportunities, women who left the education system early, singlemothers and so on. So, it’s not so much an issue of social class, as you can berelatively high class in Japan without having a lot of money, but of economicstability, or rather, of the lack thereof. So, in terms of the sex industry, economicclass certainly leaves these women vulnerable to exploitation. In other areas,though, such as crimes of sexual assault, those who are affected can come from amuch wider segment of society and it is not so much that the system disenfran-chises the poor, as it is the way it privileges the wealthy and allows them to pervertjustice. I think this is a common problem internationally, where higher economicclasses have a greater variety of ways to exploit the weaknesses of the system andoften at an individual level it is impossible to generate change. You need either alarger activist organisation or major media coverage to create the requiredpressure.Shrivastava: Yes, they are meant to be support systems for all people but oftenthe poor have limited access to them. This is represented in movies like Daminiwhere victims of rape, where they are poor, are often unable to get justice whenthe perpetrators come from a higher class. So, there is a question too, of whetherthe same legal support exists for victims who are poor, middle and upper class andwhether the systems have a classist element wherein victims of different typesreceive very different treatments.Dayal: I feel that there are dynamics of class and economic status in my studyon South African Indian LGBTQ1 people. Sometimes society assumes thatbecause people are from a population group that is seen to be economicallyactive, that they are immune to gender identity and sexual orientation discrimi-nation. However, this is not the case. As per my research findings, LGBTQ1people of Indian descent in South Africa experience gender identity and sexualorientation discrimination regardless of their economic backgrounds. However, inSouth Africa, many studies have confirmed that people who are in lower-incomegroups may experience higher levels of crimes, regardless of race.Shrivastava: One other aspect of this is the specific economic reality of womenas a social group. In India, for example, women are becoming much moreindependent, more involved in business, more career-oriented and are leavingtheir family homes and occupying public spaces. This empowerment is actuallydoing the opposite for men because they are starting to feel intimidated by suchwomen. We sometimes forget how much masculinity is tied to the economy andpersonal economic performance. Even to the extent that in some cultures womenare still seen as an economic burden because they are not expected to becomefinancially independent. So there is an issue where middle-class women are finding74 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.new opportunities due to these opening doors but for women from working-classor rural backgrounds, often the social mobility is significantly less open and sosocial class can be a huge factor in the problems we see. I’m assuming thatsomething similar might exist in Japan?Gray: I think that’s right. The voices that are heard are those that come fromthe middle class, the professors, the politicians, the media personalities, and whilethey might be transmitting the stories of women from lower economic classes,those women still lack the power to advocate for their own stories.Dayal: Yes, I see that too in communities where, due to a lack of money,people who experience discrimination feel silenced. Their lack of financialresources prevents them from entering a different social class where they wouldpossibly have more open expression. Without economic independence, somepeople at the receiving end of discrimination and violence feel trapped in acommunity that can be very threatening to them and which might react in a veryunsupportive or even negative way.Shrivastava: It also works the other way, as Gavan mentioned. While povertycan restrict some people’s access to support systems, wealth can give other peopleunfair access to, or the ability to buy, the justice system. But this not only happensin negative ways. There are stories like in Damini, where the main character’swealth gives her the privilege to highlight an injustice that the victim’s povertyprevented her from addressing.Dayal: That resonates completely with some beliefs in South Africa, in that alot of the activist organisations are found in more middle to upper-class com-munities, and people from the low-income communities come to these people forrepresentation. As a result, you have a class dynamic where people feel that theirstory will only be taken seriously if it is told by someone who is in a position ofauthority. There are also research studies that mention that events, such as Pride,that create visibility for LGBTQ1 people and their experiences often take place inareas that are not inclusive of people from all social groups.Gray: When I was doing research in Thailand, it was often exactly that situ-ation, where people from very, very poor communities had no way of interactingwith the courts or with other agencies, except through these activist-intermediarieswho were almost always middle class. In Japan, it is a little different though, as itis largely a middle-class society. There is poverty, of course, but it is far lessclearly delineated. Wealth and poverty are often separate from superficial dis-tinctions of high and low class so that someone who looks like they might be froma wealthy family might be living on the borderline of serious poverty, whilesomeone who appears poor might have significant cash hidden away. When itcomes to the justice system, it would definitely be money rather than social classwhich has the stronger influence. Victims will frequently be pressured to acceptout of court settlements as the best way to resolve cases of sexual violence and oneresult is that the richer you are, the easier it is to escape more significant pun-ishments by utilising your wealth.Shrivastava: Yes, I think I can relate to that, as in my research I came acrossmany scenarios where rich criminals would be able to buy off the victims. But Iwonder whether it is money or gender norms that have the bigger influenceSection II: Gender-Based Violence 75because I see very often that courts have certain expectations of women in thesecases, where if they did not act in a proper manner they are automatically treatedmore like they encouraged the crime. There was one case where a lawyer wasspeaking to a victim of assault and he was trying to say that because she had apainting in her room which showed a semi-nude woman who had her handsbound – just because of the presence of this painting – the victim-survivor hadbeen playing the role of the seductress and that she, rather than the man who hadattacked her, was the immoral one. So if you’re not prim and proper and quietand meek then you are not the right kind of woman. But of course, if you arequiet and meek you will not make a fuss about the crime. And yet, at the sametime, they expect women to fight back, and if they do not have marks on theirbody to show they resisted, then this is also used against them.Gray: You mentioned this earlier and I was thinking how similar that is toJapan where, if there’s no evidence that you’ve actually been fighting, then, it’ssuggestive of you being complicit to whatever happened. This issue has beenhighlighted by a few recent cases where people took advantage of positions ofauthority to abuse girls who were too frightened or traumatised to resist physi-cally in such a manner.Shrivastava: Sometimes it feels like the courts have a particular image of whatan ‘acceptable’ victim is and what an ‘unacceptable’ victim is and, regardless ofthe crime, if you do not fit into the right bracket you will have a harder timeachieving justice.Gray: And, of course, we have to be careful with the terms we use. Typicallywhen referring to women who suffered sexual crimes we will call them ‘survivors’,but it gets a little difficult when you are talking about the legal system, which stillrefers to perpetrators and victims. I just want to point out that if we talk aboutvictims of crime it is not meant in any way other than to refer to the legaldesignations.Shrivastava: In my research, I use Robin E. Field’s term ‘victim-survivors’ todescribe the people who have encountered rape and gender-based violence. Theterm victim-survivors, in a nutshell, means that we cannot define an individual’straumatic experience in one manner. Rather, it is up to them to decide whetherthey want to be addressed as a victim (as someone whose trauma needs to beacknowledged and supported) or as a survivor (where they have come to termswith the traumatic experience). The term – victim-survivor – allows the individualto exist in a liminal or third space and lets them define their experience the way inwhich they want to address it, rather than letting society decide for them. It is sodifficult to find the correct term to describe them. How do you think courts,lawyers and society should describe them? Often, labels can also take away powerfrom the person experiencing the trauma. How are labels handled in South Africaand Japan?Dayal: Words have great power when speaking about gender. Because genderis seen as being on a spectrum, some people feel as though you shouldn’t use theterm homosexual, as it polarises the sexuality of the people involved. Yet, whereaslanguage in some areas is so progressive and constantly changing, legal termi-nology is much more rigid and slow to change. There are a lot of researchers76 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.writing about how the wrong labels can take power away from people, so perhapsthat is something that needs to change in terms of the law.Gray: I agree completely. I mentioned earlier the problem of the system beingtoo cold and impersonal and here is one area where there is room for relativelyeasy and quick changes. Does there need to be a single catch-all term to refer toeither ‘survivors’ or ‘victims’ or can we instead allow some flexibility and humaninterest to enter into things, leave room for those involved to reclaim their ownagency and determine how they would like to be referred to in court proceedings?Dayal: I think we may be moving in that direction but we are certainly notthere yet. And I think we might expect attitudes to change much quicker thanlegal procedures. As Gavan mentioned, Japan only recently changed some sexcrime laws and in many places, there are still such outdated systems in place. Aslong as awareness of the problems continues to increase, we are at least movingthe right way.Section II: Gender-Based Violence 77This page intentionally left blankChapter 4The Insidious Culture of Fear in IndianCourtsNidhi ShrivastavaAbstractOn 20 March 2020, the four adult convicts of the 2012 Delhi rape case wereexecuted after a long debate regarding the punishment for their crime. TheDelhi rape case, unlike others, was also given to the fast track court becauseof the worldwide outrage India received in its aftermath. Otherwise, mostrape survivors rarely speak out and if they do, their lives are often endan-gered and threatened, depending on the severity of the case itself and theperpetrator’s rank in the society. Through the analysis of Aniruddha RoyChowdhury’s, 2016 film Pink, and Ajay Bahl’s film Section 375 (2019), thischapter explores the different ways in which mainstream Hindi cinema dealswith such questions, especially in its depictions of courts. Both these filmsforeground India’s contemporary cultural systems of fear that silence therape survivors. They also imply that in the court cases, unless the specificcourt case faces intense global publicity, as was the case of the Delhi gangrape, rape survivors will never want to speak out. Moreover, the rape sur-vivors will also hesitate to file a First Information Report (FIR) – a docu-ment that records crimes by the police against their perpetrators – limitingany possibility for justice for them. The laws surrounding rape cases areobscure and complex and finding justice for a rape victim (unless it is on aglobal level) is not an easy venture in India. At the time of the #metoomovement, the rape laws in India are not designed in such a way to arguablyencourage victim-survivors to speak up. Instead, if rape survivors do decideto confront their perpetrators, they not only face ostracisation from societybut also the danger of losing loved ones and endanger their lives as well.Gender Violence, the Law, and Society, 79–89Copyright © 2022 Nidhi ShrivastavaPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

On 5 December 2019, a twenty-three-year-oldwoman was set on fire in the Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh (Sagar, 2019).She did not survive the heinous attack and succumbed to her injuries the next day(Kumar, 2019).A year earlier, she had accused two men of raping her, had testified againstthem in a court in Rae Bareli, and had filed a case report against them. In 2018,she reported that both Shivam and his friend Shubham raped her again at gun-point, which led her to file a report in Lalganj police station in Rae Barelli (Sagar,2019). She struggled to get the attention of the police who did not take any actionagainst the accused, such that she was compelled to reach out to the PoliceSuperintendent, who also did not show any interest in pursuing the case further. Itwas not until March 2019, after she had filed a case report in the District Court,that the police recorded her first information report (FIR) against the two men shehad accused of rape. Shivam was arrested and released two months later, inNovember 2019.In the aftermath of the rape victim’s untimely death, the political leadership ofUttar Pradesh claimed that there would be a fast-track court set up to deliverjustice to the victim and her family (Siddiqui, Bhardwaj, & Phartiyal, 2019).However, the authors of Reuters note that the judicial system in India, especiallyfor rape cases, involves ‘lengthy trials’ that ‘delay convictions leaving poor,disillusioned victims with little money or patience to pursue the case’ (Siddiquiet al., 2019). Moreover, they add that ‘long trials result in bails to the accused whooften intimidate victims and their witnesses, and try tampering with evidence’(Siddiqui et al., 2019).This case makes visible that despite the recent amendments to the rape laws in2013 – initiated in the aftermath of the 2012 Delhi rape case – the current systemultimately does not support the rape victim-survivor, rendering her helpless andre-traumatising her in the process. Since the colonial era, the rape laws in Indiahave been shaped by fundamentals rooted in patriarchal attitudes. The resultingsystem scrutinises the rape victim-survivor if she decides to pursue the case incourt to get justice for the violent crime that has been committed against her.Through a chronological examination of films that were released between the1980s and present times, in this chapter I explore not only how the Hindi filmindustry depicts rape victim-survivors during court trials and attempts to prob-lematise the treatment of them in court but I also argue that such cultural rep-resentations embody the contradictions that exist within the Indian judicialsystem. These discourage rape victim-survivors from speaking up against theirperpetrators and filing the FIR. Many women are afraid to come to the forefrontand seek justice for themselves because they experience a fear for their lives, andhumiliation and shame for both themselves and their loved ones. Therefore, it is80 Nidhi Shrivastavain these judicial spaces that the ‘culture of fear’ exists. The term – culture of fear –can be defined as social and political conditions that prevent or discourage rapevictim-survivors from coming forward into the public sphere to share theirtraumatic experiences and reporting their cases to the law systems to get socialjustice. We will see examples of ‘culture of fear’ in the filmic representations that Iexplore in this chapter.Feminist scholar Skylab Sahu (2012) contends that the ‘[Indian] law exercisespower and disqualifies women’s experiences and or knowledge’ (Sahu, 2021,p. 165) and that ‘when the laws and policies followed and formulated in a stateoften or at times help the state to retain its hegemony and the dominance ofparticular groups within society, it then helps in maintaining an unjust status quoof power instead of ensuring justice to the vulnerable’ (Sahu, 2021, p. 166).Similarly, Swapna Mukhopadhyay (1999) argues that there is ‘the disenchant-ment with the potential of law as an instrument of social transformation’ (p. 11)because feminist human rights lawyer, Flavia Agnes, in her meticulous research,demonstrates ‘that laws, old and new, are structured to operate against the largerinterests of women’. (p. 12) Indeed, the journey to get justice is tumultuous andoften considered a shameful and humiliating event not only for the rapesurvivor-victim but also for her family members.As we will see, the trials that are represented in the films reduce the rapevictim-survivors (usually women) to the essentialised figures of ‘good’ or ‘bad’women – depending on their past sexual history, behaviour and lifestyle. In mostcases when the trial takes place, the rape victim is judged based on her previoussexual history, her behaviour and education. Second, the victim’s testimony is alsooften used against her. If she is disenfranchised and poor, then she is furtherunable to seek justice for herself as the cultural and legal systems are oftenpowerful enough to silence her in the process. Moreover, the rape victim-survi-vor’s body is sexualised during the rape trial as her sexual history is broughtforward. While filmmakers in Hindi cinema problematise and highlight theseissues within Indian judicial system, the treatment of rape victim-survivors andpatriarchal attitudes that silence them continues to remain unchanged even today,as evidenced by the 2019 Unnao gang rape case. It also further highlights thatwhile such rape laws and their amendments aim to act as instruments of socialchange, they are not enforced because of the socio-political and cultural structuresthat exist – whether it’s shame, lack of awareness of rights and deployment offurther violence through abuse of power that prevents the rape victim-survivorfrom speaking up, filing a report or fighting for justice in courts.The History of Indian Rape Laws, the 1983 Amendment, B.R.Chopra’s Insaaf ka Tarazu (1980) and Rajkumar Joshi’sDamini (1993)Historically, the Indian rape laws are rooted in its colonial era and were estab-lished vis-à-vis the Indian Penal code (IPC) 1860. Informed by reports fromThomas Macaulay’s Indian Law Commission in 1837, the law defined ‘the crimeThe Insidious Culture of Fear 81of rape as sexual intercourse by a man with a woman against her will and withouther consent, except in cases involving girls under nine years of age where consentwas immaterial’ (Kolsky, 2010, p. 109). In 1860, the age of consent was raised to10 years and the sentencing was either life or up to 10 years (Kolsky, 2010,p. 109). Indian women faced a dual challenge in colonial courtrooms because theywere not only ‘subjected to British legal presumptions about false charges, theyalso had to contend with specifically colonial ideas about the unreliability ofnative witnesses and other prejudicial ideas about Indian culture’ (Kolsky, 2010,p. 111). Instead of deterring from these archaic rape laws, Indian law practitionersembraced them.Jaising Modi’s Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology (1920) continues toremain an established text that is referred to in Indian courts to this day. Modi’stext, according to Kolsky, echoes the sentiments of colonial predecessors whoalways already view the rape victim-survivor as a hostile witness unless she provesotherwise. Elizabeth Kolsky’s (2010) study of rape trials in colonial India between1860 and 1947 indicates that the ‘colonial criminal jurisprudence was markedlyhostile to rape victims who sought judicial remedy in court’ (p. 122). ‘A woman’scharge’, Kolsky writes, ‘required some form of material corroboration, preferablya body evidencing the crime, although assumptions about class and culturesometimes trumped proof of bodily injury and broken bodice strings’ (p. 123).Kolsky further observes that ‘strict evidentiary requirements were established bythe courts according to the presumption that the doubly doubtful complainant(the native woman) was a non-credible witness whose testimony could not betrusted’ (p. 123). In other words, the rape victim-survivor had to ‘corroborate hercharge and prove non-consent’ by providing additional evidence such as ‘a freshcomplaint, class and caste background, prior sexual activity, and, most impor-tantly, physical marks of violent resistance on the body evidencing the crime’(p. 123).These colonial rape laws continue to influence the contemporary rape lawseven today, though the famous 1972 Mathura rape case led to 1983 amendmentsin the rape laws. A sixteen-year-old girl, Mathura, was repeatedly raped by a headpolice constable and his colleague while she was in police custody. When her casewas tried, the Supreme court concluded that Mathura was responsible for thealleged rape because there was an ‘absence of injuries on her body’ (Kolsky, 2010,p. 124) which showed no evidence of resistance. Thus, her perpetrators wereacquitted. Flavia Agnes (1992) further adds that Mathura’s character was decidedbased on the fact that she ‘had eloped with her boyfriend’ and was ‘habituated tosexual intercourse and hence could not be raped’ (p. WS-20).The Supreme Court’s judgement led to nation-wide outrage and protests byfeminists and other lawmakers who intervened and demanded a review of thecourt’s judgement in Mathura’s rape case in 1979 (Sahu, 2021, p. 61). Ultimately,the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1983 was established, which states that ‘ifthe victim says that she did not consent to sexual intercourse, the court shallpresume that she did not consent’ (Sahu, 2021, p. 61). Renowned women’s rightslawyer Flavia Agnes (1992), cultural anthropologist Veena Das (1996), feministscholars of law and sociology Pratiksha Baxi (2014) and Skylab Sahu (2021) have82 Nidhi Shrivastavastated that although there were some positive changes associated with theseamendments, they were largely symbolic.A cult classic, B.R. Chopra’s Insaaf ka Tarazu (1980) was released in theaftermath of the Mathura rape case. Film critic Deepa Ghalot (2016) has calledthis film ‘bold for its time’ and said that it was considered ‘progressive at a timewhen rape victims in Hindi films usually committed suicide or were sometimes“accepted” by a noble man who did not hold her non-virgin status against her’.The film’s plot explores society and law’s patriarchal attitudes that shaped thejudge and lawyer’s perception of the rape victim. Bharti (Zeenat Aman) is apopular model who attracts attention not only for her beauty but also because sheis modern, assertive and not afraid to take on modelling projects which at the timewould have been considered risqué (photo shoots in swimming costumes andother revealing westernised outfits). Although she has a boyfriend, Ashok(Deepak Parashar), she encounters Ramesh (Raj Babbar) during one of hermodelling events. He finds himself obsessed with Bharti and turns up at several ofher modelling shoots, eventually holding a party for her. Ultimately, he rapes herduring a visit. There are two trials that take place in the film. In the first one,Ramesh is acquitted after the defence lawyer shames Bharti for her lifestyle andcareer choices. In the second half of the film, Ramesh humiliates and rapesBharti’s sister, Neeta (Padmini Kohlapure). In anger, Bharti shoots and killsRamesh. The film suggests that a raped survivor-victim has to take laws into herown hands to gain justice, as the judicial system does not support them.The representation of both trials is insightful. At the beginning of the first trial,Bharti is warned by her female lawyer that many women do not file charges ofrape – because often they are humiliated and shamed but the perpetrator is notconvicted. This gender bias is made visible during the covering of the rape itself:whenever she denies his claims, the defence lawyer speaks to her in a dismissivetone. Chandra dissects different aspects of Bharti’s culturally un-traditional andmodern behaviour. During the cross-examination, we see that Chandra usesBharti’s lifestyle and career choices for choosing to adopt a modelling career overa secretary job (which he considers to be more decent for a young woman) as away to discredit her. Throughout the trial, he shows that Bharti is responsible forthe rape and not Ramesh because she is a woman of a ‘loose’ and indecentcharacter (Chopra, 1980, pp. 1:14:43–1:20:00). In contrast, the second trial isnoticeably different because Bharti is no longer clad in a western dress. Instead,she is wearing a sari with her head covered. The attitudes of the judges andlawyers change remarkably at this time. In the initial ruling against her in the firsttrial, the judge’s decision resulted in Bharti’s social ostracisation in her societywhere she was not only viewed with hateful and disgusted eyes but was also spiton. Whilst being examined, she says that her trial became an example of theconsequences that rape survivors face if they choose to step forward. This is apivotal moment in the film for two reasons. First, we hear Bharti, the rape sur-vivor-victim’s testimony as she admonishes the judge and defence lawyers whoshamed and obliterated her case in the first trial. The film seems to argue that thepatriarchal and misogynistic attitudes permeate the justice system creating con-ditions that prevent a rape survivor from seeking justice. Ultimately, she is forcedThe Insidious Culture of Fear 83to take the law into her own hands to punish the rapist. It is no wonder that thisfilm is still considered to be a cult classic. At the end of the film, the judge and thedefence lawyer, Chandra, are ashamed such that the judge even steps down fromhis position because he could not deliver Bharti justice. Her honour is alsorestored after her boyfriend Ashok’s family accepts her and her sister back intotheir lives after the trial, as if the rape and murder had never happened. The film,therefore, suggests that for a raped woman to regain her honour, she is left withno choice but to seek justice on her own terms whether it be by breaking laws.Although Insaaf ka Tarazu shows a progressive representation of a rapevictim-survivor, it is important to note that Bharti, who was a model by profes-sion, belonged to middle/upper middle class, even though the defence lawyerdisparaged her work in court. She still had a further privileged position thatenabled her to speak up and condemn the court. In Rajkumar Joshi’s Damini(1993), however, that is not the case because the rape victim-survivor belongs to alower class and works as a domestic servant. The film reveals complex powerstructures that continue to silence and erase the narratives of rapesurvivor-victims, especially those who would be considered poor.The film follows the story of Gupta family who use their power to cover up thebrutal gang-rape of Uma, their domestic servant, that Rakesh, Damini’sbrother-in-law, and his friends are responsible for. Throughout the film, we seeinstances of different avenues of power and law: police, prosecuting lawyers andeven Damini’s wealthy father-in-law are working to silence Uma. At first, Uma isadmitted to the hospital where none of the Gupta family members come to visither. Eventually, she is murdered by the police. The narrative then shifts toDamini, who begins the journey to fight for her justice. We do not see Uma at allduring the trial: although it is her rape case that is at the heart of the film, thefocus is not on her. It is implied that she has been murdered by the corruptpolicemen who have been bribed by the perpetrator’s family to do away with thecase. Instead, the film focusses on Damini and the forces that work to silence herfor speaking and advocating for the rape victim. Ironically, Damini was also thename given to the 2012 Delhi gang rape victim. But, in the film, Damini is thevictim’s advocate/activist, not the rape victim herself. The common thread thatboth these films share is the disparaging and humiliating line of questioning thatrape survivors and their witnesses are asked to humiliate and shame them. Duringthe trial, the devious prosecuting lawyer questions Damini about the details ofUma’s rape, asking her where the men were and which parts of her body werethey holding.Damini also shows instances of ‘compromise’ – a method that has been used toput pressure on the rape victim-survivor and her family outside of the court. Inother words, Pratiksha Bakshi (2014) explains that ‘it becomes apparent that thepressure to compromise is enforced through networks of powerful middlemenincluding lawyers, policemen and local politicians who act on the behalf of theaccused. Refusal to compromise often results in tragic consequences [for the rapevictim and her families]’ (p. 182). Sahu also adds further that, ‘in many cases,compromise could be possible and trials can be curtailed, or the witness may turnhostile. There are several cases that depict the grim consequences for women who84 Nidhi Shrivastavaare raped, assaulted, murdered or were forced to commit suicide by the men whoraped them (especially when the rapists were from socio-economically andpolitically powerful groups) and because they refused to compromise’ (p. 69).Indeed, this tactic is used often by the perpetrators and their families to settle therape case outside of the court/ by persuading the rape victim to marry the manwho raped her or by threatening to harm her and her family members as I dis-cussed earlier in 2019 Unnao rape case as well. It becomes apparent, then, that ifthe rape victim belongs to the (upper) middle class or higher, she is given aplatform to challenge and, ultimately, is able to claim justice while the womenwho belong to the lower echelons of the society are left silenced and powerless inthese same courts.The 2013 Amendments to the Rape Laws, Aniruddha RoyChowdhury’s Pink (2016), and Ajay Bahl’s Section 375 (2019)The 2012 Delhi gang-rape case was so heinous that it led to another amendmentin the rape laws, after a twenty-three-year-old student was brutally gang-raped ona moving bus in Delhi. In 2013, the committee on Amendments to the CriminalLaw, also known as the Justice Verma committee, was asked to guide and advisethe Indian government as national and international protests sparked in theaftermath of the Delhi gang rape case.The 2012 Delhi gang-rape case was so heinous that Indian governmentestablished the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, resulting in significantchanges to the rape laws in the form of section 375, to ensure quicker trials andstricter punishment. Sahu highlights that, ‘the amended law bars the use of sexualhistory in determining the consent of woman and bars cross examination as theway to prove the general immoral character of the victim’. If the victim states inthe court that she did not give consent, the court will presume that it is so (p. 66).The 2012 gang-rape case also prompted the justice Verma committee to reframethe definition of rape. As a result, the ‘penetration of a woman’s vagina, urethra,anus or mouth by a penis and penetration of the vagina, urethra or anus byfinger(s), object(s), body part(s) is considered “rape”. Acts of cunnilingus andfellatio are also covered within the definition’ (Satish, 2016). By calling it ‘sexualassault’, the law now recognises that penetration by objects will also be consideredrape. The Ministry of Women and Child Development also established the $113mNirbhaya fund to ensure empowerment, safety and security initiatives dedicatedto help victims of gender and sexual violence. One of their schemes under thisfund was the creation of One Stop Centres that were designed to aid rape sur-vivors and victim-survivors medically. However, media critics have noted that theone stop centres have been inefficient in providing the appropriate services to therape victim-survivors (Bajoria, 2017). Additionally, the current rape laws in Indiaproblematically acknowledge only the sexual violence experienced by people whoare assigned female at birth. These laws do not recognise the gender-basedviolence that young men and transgender people experience in India. AayushAkar and Shubhank Suman (2020) note that, at most, Indian rape laws refer toThe Insidious Culture of Fear 85the act of sodomisation under section 377 [10] of the Indian Penal Code, butbeyond that there is an assumption that the rape victim-survivors are primarilywomen, in the Indian court of law.Since 2013, the state and government, as well as the judicial government, havein fact created and designed laws that do support the victims of gender and sexualviolence. Social-political and cultural realities prevent the rape and sexualviolence survivor from receiving the support she needs as she is reeling from thetrauma of the crime. Sahu reports, ‘lack of coordination between the one-stopcentre, the police, the magistrate, medical service and the magistrate createshurdles for the rape survivor’ (p. 176). Rupal Oza, a feminist geographer who hasworked on sexual and gender-based violence in Haryana, has also argued that‘despite amendments to the 2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, which holds thepolice accountable for not filling a first information report, Human Rights Watchfound that the police resist filing cases, especially if the accused is from a domi-nant caste or community’ (p. 104).In the aftermath of the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case, there was a significantcultural response from filmmakers, activists and feminist groups. Among themwere the films, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury’s Pink (2016) and Ajay Bahl’s Section375 (2019). Pink begins in media res as three female roommates – Minal, Falakand Andrea – are seen escaping from a dangerous situation. At the same time, wesee three men – Raunak, Vishwajyoti and Rajveer – who are injured and beingrushed to the hospital. As the plot thickens, we learn that the group of men andwomen had met up for drinks after a concert they had attended. It becomesevident that Minal has caused a head injury to Rajveer. As the women try to putthe incident behind them, Rajveer’s friend Ankit begins to send threats to Minaland desires revenge for his friend’s injury. Falak loses her job after a scandalousphoto of hers is sent to her boss and the men also start to harass her landlord todiscourage her from filing a court case. The local police are aware that the menhave connections with political leaders and are afraid to charge them. We see aninstance of compromise as the men eventually kidnap Minal and threaten andmolest her in a moving car, which leaves her shaken. Because of Rajveer’s uncle’sconnections, it is Minal who is arrested for attempted murder. Andrea and Falakseek the help of Deepak, a reputed lawyer who has retired. He vows to fight forher as her trial begins. In this trial, Rajveer’s lawyer, like Barrister Chandra, alsoattacks Minal’s character and reputation because she is an independent girl livingin Delhi: he suggests that the women prostituted themselves to the men anddemanded money for their company. Intent on deriding Minal’s moral character,the defence implies once again that it is the victim who is responsible for the rapeattempt. As the trial continues, the women argue that it was the men who hadtried to sexually assault and rape them. Thus, Minal had hit Rajveer with a bottlein self-defence. Deepak argues that the trial is about consent – when a womansays no, it means no – and their clothes, drinking habits and lifestyle should not bedetermining factors. Pink, like Insaaf ka Tarazu, shows a progressive represen-tation of a rape survivor who also had to take the law into her own hands becausethe conditions were so perverse that she had no choice but to act in defense.86 Nidhi ShrivastavaUnlike Bharti, who killed her perpetrator, Minal is ostracised, blamed for theevents that have unfolded, and had her arrested.It becomes clear that even if the rape laws have been changed to recognise awoman’s testimony, the cultural systems and society’s patriarchal often misogy-nistic attitudes continue to seep into the court room trials. In fact, the final film,Section 375, is arguably a regressive representation in this genre of films andultimately foregrounds the problematic notion that women are filing false rapecases for revenge. Released amidst the #MeToo movement, the film explores arape case in the entertainment industry. Notable film director Rohan Kurana(Rahul Bhat) is accused of rape by costume designer Anjali Dangle (MeeraChopra). The court case is taken up by prosecutor Tarun Saluja (AkshayeKhanna) and Hiral Gandhi (Richa Chaddha), his former mentee who ispassionate about social justice. Saluja has a very troubling belief: essentially thatlaw is business, and not an instrument of social justice. He argues that Anjali hadcreated this story of rape as a way to take revenge on Rohan after their rela-tionship soured. While Hiral tries to follow the law and argues that consent is stillrelevant even if a relationship has taken place where two people were mutuallyinvolved, the film implies that the judges are under pressure to support the rapevictim even though evidence seems to suggest that she is doing this for revenge.The most frustrating part of this film, as a viewer, is the ending, because Anjaliconfesses that she had indeed filed the rape charge to avenge Rohan for breakingup with her.Films such as Section 375 show that women often file false rape charges andproblematically revert back to the old and archaic colonial laws that weredoubtful of a woman’s testimony. Although this chapter only briefly surveys aselection of four films, it becomes clear that even in the Hindi film industry, rapevictim-survivors are viewed with ambivalence and doubt. The rape survivors arecompelled to take justice and law into their own hands (which is one extreme) ifthey belong to (upper) middle or elite classes, which is when there is a danger thatthey can also file a false rape charge because of their bad and immoral character.If they are poor or marginalised, then they are unable to even stand trial and aresilenced before they enter the court, as we saw in Uma’s case in Damini.ConclusionThis chapter has been perhaps one of the most challenging and emotionallydevastating ones to write because it becomes apparent that there have been sig-nificant and noticeable shift in rape laws since India’s inception in 1947. Yet, rapevictim-survivors continue to be questioned. Oza sees in her work that ‘even whenthey [the rape victim-survivors] are discouraged from filing a case, the veryattempt at lodging a complaint is an act of defiance’ (2020, p. 105). Although it isindeed true that more women and rape survivors are coming forward, the culturaland societal systems continue to influence the judicial system which does notenforce the laws and often works against the rape survivor. The 2019 Unnaogang-rape case is a clear example of this. Finally, the film industry, which itselfThe Insidious Culture of Fear 87has had to reckon with #MeToo movement, has been able to create and constructnarratives of empowered rape survivors, though within the industry itself, thejustice for many rape-survivors remains unachievable as their own reputation isput in jeopardy if they come forward.ReferencesAayush, A., & Shubhank, S.

This structure of prosecutorial apathyhas meant that female victims, and wider society, have been insufficientlyprotected from all but the most extreme cases of abuse and assault. However,a growing political interest in gender equality and the nascent developmentof a Japanese #MeToo movement has brought more pressure for reforms,with 2017 seeing the first significant change of Japan’s sex crime laws in 110years. Despite this, many serious flaws remain to be addressed, including:concerns over the statute of limitations for sexual crimes, the manner inwhich vague legal definitions can prevent the law from being effectivelyapplied, the lack of support for victims, and the often arbitrary standards forprosecution and the settlement system that allows the wealthy to avoid morethan cursory punishment. This chapter examines the efforts to introducereforms and the extent to which such changes are likely to have a positiveimpact on the well-being, safety and legal rights of Japanese women.Keywords: Japan; Sexual violence; gender violence; rape; women’s rights;sexual assaultGender Violence, the Law, and Society, 91–103Copyright © 2022 Gavan Patrick GrayPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

One of these is themanner in which women are protected and served by the law. Unlike the generallyproactive and effective nature of its approach to crime, in this area, Japan hasfailed to achieve the kind of gender equality that many other developed countrieshave demonstrated. Outmoded gender attitudes are reflected in archaic lawswhich, despite some recent revisions, remain unsuitable for addressing therequirements of women in respect to protection from violent crime, especially thatof a sexual nature. Fortunately, public attitudes are changing and there is agrowing wave of support for further change that could bring Japan more in linewith its international peers and safeguard the rights and welfare of its femalecitizens. Perhaps the most important issue, though, is whether such changes willbe purely superficial, aimed at changing laws alone as a symbolic gesture towardsgender parity, or whether they will focus on some of the deeper, structural ele-ments of the Japanese legal system which have been instrumental in preventing amore equitable application of justice in many cases of sexual violence.Current SituationGiven Japan’s low level of crime, many are often surprised by how strict its legalsystem is, with relatively severe punishments being common for offences that inother countries might be considered minor. In fact, Japan has been frequentlycriticised for failing to protect the rights of criminal suspects by subjecting them toharsh interrogations, spartan jail conditions and extended periods of detentionwithout bail, based on flimsy evidence (HRW, 2019).However, in some areas, its protection of victims also leaves a lot to be desired.In terms of gender equality, Japan ranks 110th out of 149 countries (WEF, 2018),and signs of this disparity can be seen in many elements of an otherwise admirablesocial system. One of these is the response toward sexual crimes against women.Considering the low level of other violent crimes, it is significant that 7.8% ofJapanese women report that they have experienced forced sexual intercourse atsome point (GoJ, 2017, p. 68). It is also notable that while roughly 20% of crimesin Japan are committed by minors, when it comes to the offences of rape andsexual assault they are the primary victims in 41.6% and 52.5% of cases, respec-tively (Ogasawara, 2011, p. 164).It has been widely recognised for some time that such crimes, and thedisproportionate targeting of minors, has been a shameful smear on Japan’snational image and various campaigns – from women-only train cars to appsdesigned to protect young girls from molesters – have been part of the pushbackagainst the problem. In recent years there have been more significant1This work was supported by a Kaken grant (18K13005) from the Japan Society for thePromotion of Science.92 Gavan Patrick Grayimprovements, including the introduction of prefectural sexual assault hotlines,increased training of female investigators with a focus on victim awareness andgreater collaboration with private support groups that offer specialised trainingand victim counselling. However, the demand for wider reform has been building,and many hoped that the worldwide #MeToo movement would play a part inhelping Japan initiate such change. Initially, however, the movement was pri-marily localised around professional support networks that highlighted theproblems faced in individual, high-profile cases, and many women still faced abacklash that included victim-blaming and social and professional ostracisationfor those who challenged the system. The impact of the popular movement wasnot as visibly impactful as in neighbouring South Korea. Where it led directly to asignificant policy change regarding gender-based violence (Hasunuma & Shin,2019).Despite the less forceful nature of the Japanese movement, since its beginning aseries of court cases that resulted in the dismissal of charges for sexual crimes havereignited public anger over what is perceived as a failure to protect vulnerablewomen and generated a series of ‘flower demos’, public protests organised by anetwork of women’s rights groups. Their goal has been to highlight specificoutstanding weaknesses in the legal system and put increased pressure on thegovernment to respond with concrete policies that would address theselong-standing failures (Osaki, 2020).If anything, the COVID pandemic exacerbated the problems faced by womenand created a higher impetus for change to occur sooner rather than later. Fromthe beginning of the pandemic in late 2019, there were reports that levels ofdomestic violence were significantly higher than the previous year (Ando, 2020),while in late 2020 Seiko Hashimoto, the Minister for Gender Equality, announcedthat the number of consultations at support centres for sexual violence hadincreased 15.5% year on year (Tokyo Shinbun, 2021).Recent Legal ChangesIn 2017, Japan made the first major changes to its penal code on sex crimes inmore than 110 years. These revisions increased the penalty for many crimes,altered the definition of ‘rape’ to move beyond vaginal penetration by a penis andallowed crimes such as rape and sexual assault to be prosecuted even wherevictims do not file charges (Osaki, 2017).While these changes were both needed and welcome, they perhaps served agreater value in showing that after more than a century of intransigent resistanceto the demands of modernity, meaningful change in the legal system was actuallypossible. They did not, however, go nearly far enough in addressing the myriadproblems that still remain. The fact that these problems are so wide-rangingmeans that efforts to address them will likely involve a long campaign of incre-mental battles, rather than something that can be achieved in a single set ofsweeping revisions. These include things like coercive exploitation in thepornography industry, where abolitionists and industry groups fight a back andResponses to Sexual Violence in Japan 93forth struggle over the balance between commercial freedom and the protection ofhuman rights (Norma &Morita, 2020). It also involved the Joshi-Kousei elementsof the sex trade, which commodify the sexualisation of schoolgirls (Ogaki, 2018).This is an industry with strong ties to the ongoing problem of domestic humantrafficking in Japan where, despite the introduction of regional laws aimed atcurtailing their exploitation, significant numbers of minors are inducted into thesex industry each year (Acadimia, 2018). However, these issues – tied as they areto the culturally embedded, and highly profitable, sex industry – will likely see aslower rate of change and the requirement of a general public shift in attitudestoward commercialised sex. In the short term, there exists far more potential togenerate significant change in the way the legal system addresses the crimes ofsexual violence. When the 2017 reforms were introduced, they included a provi-sion that required a review of the sex crimes laws within three years, and manyactivist groups see this as an opportunity to focus on some key areas which the2017 revisions failed to address (Sieg, 2019).Outstanding IssuesFollowing the 2017 revisions, the key driver of public desire for further reformswas a series of highly publicised court cases in 2019 in which several, apparentlyclear-cut, cases of abuse and assault were dismissed due to the outstandingweaknesses in the legal system. In one of these cases, a man on trial for repeatedlyraping his teenage daughter was acquitted on the grounds that she had notexhibited sufficient physical resistance to the attacks (Eiraku & Aizawa, 2019).While this might, on the face of it, seem like a lapse in judicial oversight, in thiscase the judge was merely following the written laws. Japan has long held the viewthat rape is inherently an act of violence and thus to show an incidence of rapethere should be evidence that force or threats were used (Egawa, 2019). However,as has become abundantly clear as our understanding of such crimes has evolved,rape can be carried out in certain cases without non-sexual violence or the threatthereof – for example, where a victim is rendered drunk or insensible, is tooterrified to resist physically or is in a relationship with the perpetrator wherenon-physical coercive control can be exerted, such as a family member, orteacher. Japan’s failure to recognise such nuances led directly to the aboveinstances of acquittal, but they also helped to focus a growing sense of publicdissatisfaction with the outdated legal strictures. The problems that exist are,however, quite varied in nature and in scope, with some primarily requiringchanges to the poorly worded or overly lenient laws. Others require broaderchange in how the laws themselves are applied, for example, the manner in whichthe prosecution system treats victims generally, and the role played in the pros-ecution process by Japan’s ‘settlement’ system.One area where revision of laws alone might suffice is the statute of limitationswhich applies to sex crimes. In 2010, the statute of limitations for murder andother capital crimes, which was previously 25 years, was abolished. Yet, the 10-year limit for rape charges, and the 7-year limit for sexual assault, remains fixed.94 Gavan Patrick GrayA 2019 case brought attention to their limitations when a suspect in a rape casewas identified by DNA tests for a separate crime, just four days after the statute oflimitations had expired. Luckily, in Japan the statute is suspended during anytime the suspect is outside Japan, and in that case the suspect’s internationaltravel during the intervening years created a two-month extension that allowedcharges to be made. Nonetheless, it ably highlighted the weakness of the currentlimits and the need, if not for abolition, then for a significantly extended period ofpotential arrest and prosecution (Sankei, 2019b).A similar problem of insufficient legal regulation exists in the definition of, orfailure to define, certain crimes. For example, voyeurism, the illicit observance,photography or recording of women without their knowledge, is a commonproblem in Japan, yet there is no actual crime that fits this action. As a result,offenders are instead charged under a variety of minor crime laws such as Tres-passing, Nuisance Prevention or, in the case of minors being involved, the moreserious Child Pornography Law (Maeda, 2016).The vagaries of lax definition were further highlighted in a case where a manwas arrested for ‘splashing bodily fluid’ onto the arm of a schoolgirl. Again, therewas difficulty knowing what to charge him with. Indecent assault required the useof violence or threats and so was deemed inadmissible. The Nuisance PreventionLaw could have been used but this would have limited the maximum punishmentto one year of jail. Instead, the charge was deemed to be Common Assault, with apotential two-year sentence. If the act had been deemed to have damaged thegirl’s clothing, however, the law for Criminal Damage to Property could havebeen applied with a possible three-year prison sentence (Maeda, 2020).The fact that it can be so unclear on what grounds sexual offenders should becharged, as well as the fact that damage to property is deemed more serious thanboth assault and sexual molestation, are clear signs that some fundamentalchanges in the wording of laws and their sentencing guidelines are still required.Standards of ProsecutionMoving away from the definition of the crimes themselves, there exist severaldeeper problems with the manner in which the laws are applied, one of the mostserious of which is the nature of prosecution in Japan. For a long time, Japan wasregarded as a ‘prosecutor’s paradise’ where the Office of Public Prosecutorenjoyed considerable leeway in deciding which cases to pursue and how to handletheir enforcement. Since the 1990s there has been a general increase in trans-parency and victim’s rights, yet, the influence of the prosecutor on criminal casesis still very powerful (Johnson, 2012, p. 37). One way that this comes into playwith cases of sexual violence is that many such cases resolve with a decision toforgo prosecution. The most problematic aspect is that in such instances there isalmost no transparency, there is no public record of the reasons fornon-prosecution and even victims have only very limited opportunity, in casesinvolving death or injury, to access these records (Kamon, 2019, p. 53).Responses to Sexual Violence in Japan 95This is an especially critical issue as the prosecutors’ office represents the last ina long line of hurdles that must be cleared for a sex crime to be brought to opencourt. The first barrier is the victim actually reporting the incident; the second isthe police making an official crime report; the third is apprehending the suspectand the last, the prosecutors deciding to formally indict them on the criminalcharges. The lack of transparency means that not only is it true that very few sexcrimes are ever brought to court, we generally never learn why this failed to occurin the other instances, a situation that does a disservice to both victims’ need forclosure and the general public’s need for understanding of the system’s efficacyand its impact on public safety (Maita, 2020).Considering the size of the Japanese population and the aforementionedgovernment surveys that suggest one in 13 women are victims of rape or sexualassault, one can estimate that there are at least 66,000 incidents per year.2 Yet,government records account for slightly less than 6,000 officially recognised cases(GoJ, 2019, p. 2), suggesting that, at a minimum, less than 10% of incidents arereported. Then, only a third of these are actually prosecuted, which would meanthat, at most, only 3% of serious sexual crimes in Japan are prosecuted. The levelof prosecutions has also been steadily declining, from 43.4% in 2014 to 34.2% in2019 (GoJ, 2019, p. 5).While we do not know the specific reasons for non-prosecution in individualcases, the government does release statistics that give a breakdown of reasons forchoosing not to indict suspects where the grounds are ‘insufficient evidence’.Between 2018 and 2019 there were 380 such cases related to sexual offences. Thestatistics reveal that, by far, the most common reasons for claiming insufficientevidence are the possibility that sex may have been consensual (47% of cases) orthat the perpetrator may have believed it to be consensual (40% of cases), and thatthere was doubt regarding the truthfulness of the victim’s statement in 89% of theformer and 61% of the latter cases (GoJ, 2021, p. 3). This raises the question ofwhether such subjective judgements should be made at such a preliminary stage ofthe legal process, but it also shows, perhaps more importantly, that the majorityof cases where non-indictment occurs are for other reasons than a lack of evidenceand, while there has been little hard data generated on the numbers involved, theprimary reasons appear to be victim hesitancy and the use of settlements.Treatment of VictimsIn any circumstances, there are numerous reasons why undergoing the lengthyand draining process of a criminal prosecution can be an undesirable ordeal onthe part of a victim of sexual crimes: discomfort regarding the level of publicdisclosure, a sense of shame, fear of revenge on the part of the perpetrator or theeffects of post-traumatic stress, among others. In Japan, these factors can beexacerbated by normative expectations to conform to certain social morals and2In comparison, RAINN estimates 433,648 rapes and sexual assaults in the United Stateseach year. https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence.96 Gavan Patrick Graythe fear that any involvement in such criminal proceedings, even as the victim,might tarnish one’s reputation (Kamiya, 2019).Victims also have to face interactions with police and prosecutors that canrange from indifferent, to cold or even hostile. In one case a young woman wastaken advantage of while in a severe state of intoxication and immediately went tothe police to report a crime. However, prosecutors refused to indict the suspectbecause, during the man’s recording of the act, the girl had said ‘stop filming me’instead of ‘stop raping me’. The possibility that the girl may have been resolved toher inability to stop the assault but still concerned about it being made a publicspectacle was dismissed in favour of the common view that lack of direct, physicalresistance negated possible conviction for rape (Ito, 2019).There is also a seemingly widespread reluctance among police to pursue sexualassault aggressively, and stories of casual indifference to such crimes arecommonplace (Maeda, 2019). The author has personally spoken with severallawyers representing victims of such crimes who reported that the police activelypressured their clients to forgo making a formal criminal report.3 A commonbarrier that any victim will have to cross at an early stage is being asked ‘what didyou do to resist’, with the implicit message that if they did not do enough, then theinability of police or prosecutors to proceed is down to the victim’s failure to act.This is only the beginning of a process that, for the victim, can be long, highlystressful and demeaning.Given the history of poor treatment of victims, it is perhaps unsurprising that a2020 survey of victims of sexual violence in Japan found that only 15% actuallycontact the police at all. Less than half of these, just 7%, were actually accepted ascriminal reports, and a mere 10th of these, 0.7% of all cases, ended with con-victions (Mainichi, 2020).These outdated, and seemingly uncaring, attitudes towards victims extendbeyond the justice system. Many victims are denied access to abortions by hos-pitals due to health regulations that require the consent of the father for theprocedure to occur. No consideration is allowed for victims of rape, and in theabsence of explicit guidelines on the matter, the common response is to simplyrefuse them the option (Oshiro, 2020).The introduction of a lay-judge system to Japanese courts in 2009 allowedmembers of the public to serve as judges alongside several professionals (typically,six of the former and three of the latter). This system led to a general increase inthe number of suspended sentences and greater leniency towards suspects, exceptin cases of sexual violence, where the average sentence increased (Johnson, 2012,p. 37). Professional judges openly welcomed these changes in a manner thatsuggested they were previously restricted from imposing what they felt were justsentences due to outdated procedural guidelines (Hirayama, 2012, p. 7). Thiscertainly represents a positive development for victims. However, one weakness of3In some cases, the same lawyers told me that criminal reports they submitted to the policeon behalf of clients were returned to them without being filed, something that goes directlyagainst the letter of the law.Responses to Sexual Violence in Japan 97the lay-judge system, in regard to the handling of cases of sexual violence, is thatvictims are often reluctant to take part in a court system in which key members ofthe court may not be public officials but figures from their own community.Matters of victim protection and anonymity still need to be addressed but stepshave already begun such as the ability of victims to exclude candidate judges whomay be known to them, and for pseudonyms to be used by victims (Hirayama,2012, p. 12).While some of the above may suggest that the Japanese system has a callousattitude toward victims, this is generally not the case. Rather, the current laws arewritten, and the system structured, in a way that fails to accommodate their needsor take account of their vulnerabilities. Often the reluctance of police or prose-cutors to accept or proceed with cases is based entirely upon their knowledge ofthe likelihood of the case failing to reach a satisfactory conclusion for the victim.The primary problem on their part is that they take a purely responsive role,seeing it as their duty merely to enforce what is stipulated in law, rather thanactively pressing for change from within. Thankfully, external forces have begunto consolidate efforts to promote victim rights, and principles of restorative justiceand pressure for better patterns of response is building through a network ofhuman rights groups and victim support groups (Ito & Ishii, 2020).The Settlement IndustryOne factor which some consider a significant impediment to the process of justice,especially in cases of sexual violence, is the Japanese system of settlements knownas jidan (示談). The Japanese cultural preference for avoiding conflict favours,wherever possible, out-of-court agreements that will negate the need for a trial. Asa result of this, in many cases, apologies and settlement payments are sufficient tobring matters to a resolution. There is a widespread public perception that thisprocess means that to be wealthy means you will be able to skirt the law simply bypaying the appropriate settlement. Some net commentators have referred to itsapplication in sexual assault cases as ‘erasing rape with money’,4 and a 2019 caseinvolving a student at a prestigious university, who was arrested on five separateoccasions for crimes of sexual assault yet failed to be indicted every time, ledmany to question whether his continued freedom was entirely due to his family’sextensive wealth (Sankei, 2019a).Of course, we have already seen that other reasons do exist for such failure toprosecute, whether reluctance of the victims to undergo the difficulty of the trialprocess or a lack of reliable evidence. However, we know these factors play a roleonly in a minority of cases. Meanwhile, week after week news stories announcethe non-prosecution of suspects for unspecified reasons, raising constant questions4For an example, see the following article on the Mag2News news blogging site, Mr. Keio,as expected ‘erasing rape with money.’ Why is Japan so soft on sex crimes? (ミスター慶応、予想通り「金でレイプもみ消し」完了。なぜ日本は性犯罪に甘いのか). https://www.mag2.com/p/news/478270.98 Gavan Patrick Grayof whether the suspects involved escaped more significant punishment through theuse of a simple disbursement of cash. In the space of fewer than two weeks sur-rounding the writing of this piece, stories reported a man avoiding indictmentover the suspected rape of a female acquaintance (Kumanichi, 2021), a formerdirector of a talent agency avoiding indictment over the suspected rape of anaspiring model (Yahoo News, 2021a) and a former town councillor avoidingindictment over suspicion of exposing himself to a woman in a coffee shop(Yahoo News, 2021b). There may well have been others during the same period assuch stories are a constant element of the news cycle and rarely merit more than abrief paragraph, despite the serious nature of the crimes they may refer to only inpassing.Law offices in Japan can make significant profits from the part they play in thiscycle of payment and absolvence and are eager to highlight their proficiency inachieving settlement of such matters. There is, in fact, a ‘Settlement Market’,wherein lawyers generally know how much they will have to pay to get someoneto drop the charges in specific cases, e.g. a case of molestation above clothes willrequire X amount of Yen, while if the offender moves below clothing the cost willbe a little higher, etc. (Tabata, 2020).In this manner, skilled lawyers will be able to estimate how much a ‘get out ofjail free’ card is likely to cost their prospective clients. One public defender’s officeclaims an 81% settlement rate for indecent assault cases, with an average settle-ment amount of ¥1,554,683 (roughly $14,000) (Atom, 2020). Often, not only thelawyers, but the system as a whole acts to put pressure on victims to accept suchsettlements.One improvement of the 2017 revisions was the introduction of a‘non-confidential offence’ categorisation that allowed prosecutors to indict crimesof sexual violence even without the victims’ participation. In practice though, thesupport of the victim is generally crucial for the successful prosecution of suchcrimes, and it seems highly unlikely that we will see a significant increase in caseswhere suspects are convicted after a victim has agreed to a settlement (Maeda,2017).This settlement system is a difficult problem to address, though. On the onehand, it seems important that offenders should not be able to escape punishmentsimply by the payment of monetary amounts that might, to them, be relativelysmall. On the other hand, where the process of a criminal trial is too onerous forvictims to endure, the settlement system does allow them some recourse forachieving a form of closure and limited justice. Perhaps one flaw in the currentsystem is the notion that there is a ‘standard’ settlement price for specific offences.Rather than gauging such payments by the crime involved, it might be moreequitable to have them mandated as either a set amount related to the crime or asa portion of the offender’s assets, whichever is higher. The latter, if set sufficientlyhigh, might be one way to eliminate the possibility of wealthy individualsflaunting the system.Responses to Sexual Violence in Japan 99Movements Toward ReformWhile Japan’s legal system does have a long and very poor history in regard to itstreatment of women in general and victims of sexual violence in particular, the2017 revisions to the penal code are a strong sign that pressure for change hasgenerated a response that is more than mere superficial, face-saving. The changesmade were meaningful and fell short only in regard to the fact that the problemswhich exist are too widespread and varied to be fixed in a single burst of proactivezeal. As we saw with the issue of settlements, some of the problems still have noclear, single solution and the potential options need to be properly evaluated toensure they will produce the greatest benefit.Among the key issues that remain to be addressed is the revision of the age ofconsent to suitably reflect the impact of sexual crimes on minors. While all Jap-anese prefectures have superseding local laws that set higher ages, the national ageremains 13, and this affects how several laws categorise crimes against minors.Another issue is that several crimes need to be properly defined, including theoverly broad obscenity charge and the absence of a charge for voyeurism, amongothers. Perhaps one of the largest outstanding revisions is the issue of consent andan end to the prerequisite use of physical violence or threats to qualify a crime asrape or sexual assault. These and other key issues are, thankfully, being kept inthe political spotlight by a variety of rights groups and political activists (HRN,2020). Media coverage is also helping to raise public awareness of the nature ofthe problem and shine a spotlight on some of the key areas of needed change.This is one potential danger regarding ongoing reform, namely that, bynecessity, only a small portion of the required changes are properly highlighted inthe public sphere. The full list of desirable changes is too long, too varied and toocomplex to easily explain to the general public, or political leaders, in acomprehensive fashion. The government review process that began after the 2017revisions has now seen the 14th meeting of its fact-finding working group, whichhas laid out several of the areas it hopes to target in the next wave of revisions. Inaddition to those mentioned above, the group has shown an interest in examiningthe use of hormone therapy, medication and GPS tracking in dealing with repeatoffenders. They have also worked with experts from Finland and Sweden to assesshow those countries’ approaches to sex crimes might be adapted for Japan (GoJ,2020). In particular, it has focused on the ‘Yes means Yes’ form of explicit,consent-based sex that is endorsed in those countries, something that is verydistinct from the ‘No means No’ form, requiring clear, demonstrable rejection tonullify consent, which underlies some of Japan’s problematic laws (Mochizuki,2020).It remains to be seen what final set of recommendations this working groupwill deliver and whether they will, in fact, be accepted into law. Some scholarshave expressed concerns, however, that attempts to impose standards that work inother cultures might not have, for all their good intentions, the same success inJapan (Kamon, 2019, p. 71). Once again, changing the laws is relatively easy, butif the structures and culture surrounding those laws have deeper flaws, then it may100 Gavan Patrick Graybe that greater and more long-term change is required, and it is important to focuson such change as a continuing process with deeper structural goals.ConclusionJapanese activism in the area of sexual violence has developed new strength inrecent years, but the changes in awareness and legislation that have occurred donot represent a highpoint. Instead, it is merely the beginning of a long-overduereassessment of a flawed system. While it has the power to initiate meaningfulchange – especially in specific issues such as the nature of consent and a betterunderstanding of the plight of victims – it must not be a simple adjustment to thewording and impact of individual laws. The treatment of victims of sexualviolence, by police, prosecutors, the courts and other institutions such as hospi-tals, needs to be comprehensively reviewed and revised. The fundamental natureof the system needs to shift in a manner that recognises and accounts for theunderlying vulnerability of victims and the difficulty they have in negotiating thelegal process without specially tailored support.From the other end of the process, that of ensuring offenders are properlypunished, the system of settlements and the manner in which it can exploit vic-tims’ reluctance to engage in stressful legal proceedings, needs to be examined.The extensive and profitable system of legal services that can reliably promise theavoidance of trials in the majority of sexual assault cases must have sufficientoversight to ensure it does not offer loopholes that can be used by wealthyoffenders to escape meaningful justice.Such assessment and revision is an ongoing process and one which requirescareful consideration of the complexities involved, not simply to protect victimsbut to do so in a manner that ensures potentially innocent suspects continue toreceive suitable legal protection. It is not a battle that can be won in a single day,and while further revisions of individual laws, such as those that occurred in 2017,are both welcome and necessary, the overall process must involve a level of deeperstructural and societal analysis with the goal of constant improvement.ReferencesAcadimia, K.

The changes in SouthAfrica’s Constitution allowed for protection for all citizens. Despite thesefreedoms and the promise of change, the country is plagued by violence,corruption and crime. These crimes affect the LGBTQ1 people of the SouthAfrican population. These citizens have been protected by the Constitution;however, they continue to live their lives in a paradox, between protectionand prejudice. LGBTQ1 people experience high levels of hate crimes whichextend to violence, assault, bullying and cyberbullying. This chapter focuseson the legal protection and challenges experienced by South AfricanLGBTQ1 people.Keywords: South African Indian; LGBTQ1; hate crimes; overt discrimina-tion; discrimination; South African lawSouth African people from all walks of life rejoiced at the birth of a newdemocracy by voting on the 27th of April 1994. This new democracy would allowfor equal opportunities for all citizens, in terms of freedom, social justice andgeneral equality (Bennett & Reddy, 2015). It signalled South Africa’s reign as aregional example of hope and social rebirth. However, more than two decadesafter the birth of the democracy, a paradox exists within South Africa, wherecitizens are offered legislative freedom and protection, while there are still highGender Violence, the Law, and Society, 105–120Copyright © 2022 Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Through the Gini coef-ficient used by the World Bank, South Africa is recognised as one of the mostinequitable countries in the world (Keeton, 2014). Along with inequality, failuresin the public sector and rampant crime, the levels of social cohesion, productivityand the confidence of citizens in the public sector have decreased (Eagle, Benn,Fletcher, & Sibisi, 2013). Despite the existence of some denialist lobbyists whoclaim that high levels of crimes are normal for developing counties, there is suf-ficient evidence to show that South Africa’s crime rate is higher than the globalaverage and that citizens feel vulnerable to victimisation and violence (StatisticsSouth Africa, 2017, 2020).The internationally aligned policies in South Africa aim to protect, promoteand safeguard the rights of all citizens, including those who identify as lesbian,gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and additional sexual orientation or genderidentities (LGBTQ1) (Hirsch, 2005; Mkhize, Bennett, Reddy, & Moletsane,2010). A milestone move in 2006 saw South Africa becoming one of the firstcountries in the world to Constitutionally protect citizens against discriminationbased on sexual orientation (Bhana, 2012; Thoreson, 2008). This offered citizensadoption rights, estate rights and rights to marry (Thoreson, 2008). Despite theseadvanced and intricate legal protections, LGBTQ1 people in South Africacontinue to face discrimination and violent persecution, mainly due to the ‘un-African’ label of identifying as LGBTQ1 (Francis & Brown, 2017). The reportedexperiences of LGBTQ1 people have emphasised a disconnect between theConstitutional protection and people’s real-life experiences, which range fromdiscrimination and homophobia to acceptance (Bhana, 2012). Discriminationagainst LGBTQ1 people is also caused by notions of heteronormativity, patri-archy and conservative culture which exist within South Africa’s diverse com-munities (Ratele & Suffla, 2010). Despite the legal protections, many SouthAfrican people continue to believe that same-sex relationships are morally wrong(Sutherland, Roberts, Gabriel, Struwig, & Gordon, 2016).South Africa consists of societies rich in cultural diversity, and within thesesocieties, LGBTQ1 people have diverging experiences (Coopoosamy, 2018).While there have been aspects of positive change with regards to the experiencesof LGBTQ1 people, many qualitative and empirical studies have highlighted thedifficulties that LGBTQ1 people continue to face (Khan, 2017; Mkhize et al.,2010; OUT, 2016). A large-scale study focusing on crime in South Africa, theVictims of Crime Survey, revealed that 9.3% of respondents felt unsafe expressingtheir sexual orientation freely (Statistics South Africa, 2017). Within this statis-tical report, South African people of Indian descent are very limitedly repre-sented. There has also been only a very small focus on South African LGBTQ1people of Indian descent in other research studies (Dave, 2011; Dayal, 2021;Moonsammy, 2009).Some media representations of sexual orientation-based discrimination expe-riences of South African Indian LGBTQ1 people are highlighted in this chapter.In a round-up of some of these media representations, this chapter first exploresthe historical and causal aspects of crime and violence in South Africa. It then106 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayalproceeds to identify the prevalence of hate crimes, before unpacking the legalrights and cultural context of the LGBTQ1 communities.Hate Crimes in South AfricaHate crimes are acts of prejudice that are committed against individuals, groupsor organisations based on the groups they belong to (IACP, 1998; Marais, Nel, &Govender, 2022). These acts include hate speech, intentional unfair discrimina-tion and other hate crimes, which occur across a variety of different settings(Triangle Project, 2006). These hate crimes are intended to dehumanise anddemean individuals and groups of people (IACP, 1998). They also lead to mentalhealth challenges and experiences of trauma on the part of the victims (Maraiset al., 2022). Hate crime is a global challenge.Within South Africa specifically, 7.3% of citizens who participated in the 2017Victims of Crime Survey revealed that they feared being at the receiving end ofhate crimes (Statistics South Africa, 2017). Hate crimes that occur most preva-lently in South Africa include those that are based on nationality, race and sexualorientation. Within South Africa, homophobic views and vocalisations of hatespeech against LGBTQ1 people are still prevalent, and some studies even revealthat there may be a rise of these negative views towards LGBTQ1 people (TMGDigital, 2016). Hate crimes against female-presenting people with LGBTQ1identities are also seen to be higher than those against others (Nel & Judge, 2008).These hate crimes against women mostly occur in the form of corrective rape,murder and abuse of lesbian women (OUT, 2016).In South Africa, hate crimes are criminal offences, and the National PolicyGuideline for Victim Empowerment has introduced frameworks that addressthem. Due to the range of hate crimes present, legislature is constantly evolving,and currently, there exist some gaps in the frameworks which address them(Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, 2008; Department ofSocial Development, 2009; Nel & Judge, 2008). In 2016, updated hate crimeslegislation was presented for passage (De Barros, 2018). These legislations haveled to legal punishments for those who are perpetrators of hate crimes; which inturn led to renewed faith of citizens in the criminal justice system (Mitchley,2018).Causes of Hate Crimes in South AfricaHate crimes in South Africa occur due to a myriad of reasons (Demombynes &Özler, 2005; Statistics South Africa, 2017). Within this section, some of thedebates surrounding the causes of hate crimes will be introduced. South Africa’shistory of Apartheid forms the backdrop of hate crimes and victimisation: fromthe mid-1950s to the late-1980s, rights of citizens were categorised in a racialhierarchy and the freedoms of certain race groups were restricted (Schönteich &Louw, 1999). Apartheid presented many challenges for citizens, such as theprevention of interracial marriages, the prevention of cohabitation amongConstitutional Protection and Prejudice 107different races as well as limitations to the political expression of citizens(Kane-Berman, 1993). Around 1993, a period of transition occurred, whichsignalled the end of Apartheid (Schönteich & Louw, 1999). During this time,tensions existed within communities in South Africa, with a heightened amount ofprotests and crime (Schönteich & Louw, 1999). The intra-community conflict thatoccurred during Apartheid and towards the transition period led to an increase inthe levels of crimes in under-resourced areas (Christopher, 1994; Ramphele,1993). What’s more, as Apartheid was rooted in Christian Calvinism, during thistime the country saw an overvaluing of identities that aligned with values pre-sented by patriarchy, traditional gender roles and conservatism (Cameron, 2001;Potgieter, 2006). Due to these factors, same-sex marriages and relationships wereconsidered illegal, with sex between men being criminalised and identified as‘sodomy’ (Cameron, 2001; Gunkel, 2010). People in same-sex relationships wereoften discriminated against, and if they openly expressed their identities, they werelikely to experience job losses and family rejection (Wells & Polders, 2006).The lack of legislative recognition by policymakers and authorities in SouthAfrica has made the reporting and prosecuting of hate crimes challenging (DeBarros, 2018). This legislative lack of recognition has been compounded by otherchallenging aspects such as socioeconomic status and lack of resources of citizens.Through the onset of urbanisation, crime rates in cities exceed crime in ruralsettings, with the crime rate increasing with the size of the city (Roelofse, 2009;Statistics South Africa, 2020). In larger cities factors such as unemployment,overcrowding and the rise in consumerism are believed to be factors thatcontribute towards higher crime rates (Chalfin & McCrary, 2017; Hsieh & Pugh,1993; Pratt & Cullen, 2005; Rufrancos, Power, Pickett, & Wilkinson, 2013). TheSouth African economy sees very high unemployment rates. All these factors haveplayed intersectional roles in the perpetration of hate crimes. What’s more,empirical evidence has shown that South African people are apprehensive toreport hate crimes, where the Victims of Crime Survey of 2016/2017 state that adecline was noted (from 64.2% in 2011 to 57.3% in 2016/2017) in satisfactionlevels experienced by the public in the South African Police Service (StatisticsSouth Africa, 2017). Currently, only 7.7% of citizens have trust in the policeservices (Statistics South Africa, 2017). It will be unsurprising then, that the 2020Victims of Crime Survey (Statistics South Africa, 2020) showed that not all crimesexperienced get reported to the police.In order to reduce hate crimes, an optimal criminal justice system thatresponds quickly to reported crimes is needed. This criminal justice system needsstaff members who are fully equipped with knowledge on the updated legislation,in order to effectively apprehend and prosecute lawbreakers for their actions(Chalfin & McCrary, 2017). However, though efforts have been made on anational scale, this ideal justice system has not yet come into existence.The 2016/2017 Victims of Crime Survey reveals that there is low satisfaction ofSouth African citizens with the criminal justice system. The households’ satis-faction with courts decreased from 64.5% in 2011 to only 44.9% in 2016/2017.Only 20.9% of the households felt that there was no corruption within SouthAfrican courts, and the majority of households (45.8%) believed that sentences108 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayalthat were passed in courts were too lenient (Statistics South Africa, 2017). TheVictims of Crime survey also revealed that South African people were disap-pointed that cases involving violent crimes took too long to finalise, which did notgive people who reported these crimes effective justice (Statistics South Africa,2017). These factors result in a decreased level of crime reporting, which in thecase of hate crimes would result in a reduction in the prosecution of hate crimeperpetrators. Within a province in Gauteng, Nel and Judge (2008) found that astaggering 73% of hate crimes do not get reported by people who experience them,due to a lack of confidence in the justice system and a belief that the reporting ofhate crimes would not be given the attention that it needed. People who experi-ence hate crimes also fear that during the process of reporting the hate crimes,they will be at the receiving end of secondary victimisation by a system thatshould ultimately be safeguarding them (Nel & Judge, 2008).To promote a culture where hate speech and hate crimes are stopped, themedia’s role in showing the importance of seeking support is essential (Khan,2018). Therefore, I’ll go on to explore some of the media representations in SouthAfrican online news and lifestyle platforms.Media Representations of DiscriminationGender and sexual orientation–based discrimination experienced by South Afri-can LGBTQ1 people have been written about in many opinion pieces in themedia. These articles display how these experiences negatively affect the lives ofpeople who are at the receiving end of gender and sexual orientation–baseddiscrimination. As the focus on these experiences of South African IndianLGBTQ1 people has not been emphasised as much in media, in this chapter anattempt is made to provide a focus on South African Indian LGBTQ1 people, byusing media articles from the South African Indian Spice, Independent Online andMamba Onlinee-zines.“Calling Me a Faggot Is Not OK”The non-acceptance of LGBTQ1 people is often based on factors related topatriarchy, conservative cultures, heterosexism and religion (Ratele & Suffla,2010). LGBTQ1 people walk the tightrope of fear and acceptance – where theyare sometimes free to express themselves, and at other times experience overt andcovert discrimination (Bhana, 2012). It is noteworthy that there are intersectionalinfluences that lead to these experiences of discrimination of LGBTQ1 people(De Waal & Manion, 2006). In addition to legal attitudes that criminalise sexualorientation expression – a barrier which in theory has been overcome in SouthAfrica – aspects such as community values, race, biological sex, economicbackground and other key identities, all play a role in how discrimination orfreedom is experienced by LGBTQ1 people in South Africa and in other places(De Waal & Manion, 2006). In understanding the experiences of hate crimes,these key identities play a role in helping us understand how hate crimes areConstitutional Protection and Prejudice 109experienced, reported and processed, with each person relating to hate crimes indifferent ways (Meyer, 2008).Naufal Khan, the openly gay publisher of Indian Spice e-zine, expressed thathe has been openly experiencing sexual orientation–based discriminationthroughout his life. He reveals: ‘I have over the years been called a number ofdistasteful names due to…my sexual orientation’ (Khan, 2018). And, ‘Calling mea faggot is not ok’ (Khan, 2018). Khan (2018) shares that derogatory names wereused to make him feel uncomfortable in social settings. Within the South Africancontext, several other names are used to discriminate against gay men, such asungqingili, inkwili, moffie and faggot (Graham & Kiguwa, 2004).LGBTQ1 discrimination happens at interpersonal, personal, institutional andcommunity levels (Thompson & Zoloth, 1990). Victimisation experienced byLGBTQ1 people is not only verbal, but physical violence may also occur.LGBTQ1 people are beaten up, have objects thrown at them or objects used toharm them (OUT, 2016). Other forms of physical violence may be extreme formsof sexual violence such as corrective rape and sexual assault (Morris, 2017).Another reason LGBTQ1 people report for feeling unsafe is that their homes andproperty may be damaged due to spiteful hate crimes directed at them (Morris,2017). A large-scale study focusing on the beliefs of residents in Gauteng, a SouthAfrican province which is densely populated, found that 12% of participantsbelieved that hate crimes were an appropriate way of dealing with people whoidentified as gay (Mahomed & Trangoš, 2016).OUT LGBTQ1 Well-Being (an LGBTQ1 advocacy, research and healthcareorganisation based in South Africa) conducted a large-scale study called the HateCrimes Against LGBTQ1 people in a South Africa Survey (OUT, 2016). Theirstudy revealed that 44% of the participants experienced all possible forms ofdiscrimination. Of these forms of discrimination, the most common form ofdiscrimination they experienced was verbal insults (20%), followed by beingthreatened with physical violence (17%). The study also revealed that the minorityLGBTQ1 people of Indian descent experienced particularly high levels ofdiscrimination, with 38% of them experiencing verbal insults, 17% being threat-ened with physical violence, 11% being sexually harmed and also 11% beingabused by members of their families (OUT, 2016) – making studies on LGBTQ1people of ethnic minorities, such as this one, especially relevant. These experiencesof bullying of LGBTQ1 people, in varied settings, including schools, are oftenwritten about in media articles. One such example is an article by Jagmohan(2017), who interviewed the mother of a South African Indian gay man. Theinterviewee revealed that her son had experienced bullying regularly, which madehim struggle with his sexual orientation. In the interview, she mentioned that her‘child had battled with constant bullying […] and a struggle to accept his gayidentity’ (Jagmohan, 2017). She also says: ‘At high school he had a torturous lifeand was physically beaten’ (Jagmohan, 2017).LGBTQ1 discrimination within South African school settings is noted bymany researchers (Bhana, 2012; Francis & Reygan, 2016; Siwela, Sikhwari, &Mutshaeni, 2018). In the OUT (2016) survey, 56% of LGBTQ1 participantsreportedly experienced sexual orientation bullying in schools. The bullying is110 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayaloften tied to the idea that within school heteronormative teaching methodologiesperpetuate gender binaries, which results in students taking on traditional genderroles (Francis, 2017). Students who do not align with these traditional roles areoften picked on (Francis, 2017).The mechanics of LGBTQ1 bullying can be explained using the social identitytheory: LGBTQ1 people are seen as an out-group, making them targets ofdiscrimination and persecution as their identities are seen as incompatible withthat of the in-group. The latter then resort to discriminatory methods to make thelives of the out-group members challenging (Terry & Hogg, 2001).“People Don’t Trust the System”The process of reporting hate crimes in South Africa presents unique challenges topeople experiencing them, and there is often hesitation in reaching out to lawenforcement officers when reporting these crimes.One of these unique challenges is the difficulties present in the categorisation ofhate crimes and the policies that are directly applicable to these crimes. Untilchanges in hate crimes legislation, which took effect in 2016, and were amended in2018, policymakers were ‘flying blind’ when it came to processing hate crimereports (De Barros, 2018). Due to this, crimes that were reported were oftenclassified in a different way, resulting in data related to hate crimes beingincomplete or inconclusive (Lepodise, 2018). The existent empirical data wereusually presented in studies done by South African non-governmental organiza-tions (NGOs), who assisted those who experienced hate crimes by offering sup-port in reporting and dealing with the impact of hate crimes (Lepodise, 2018). Afive-year report by the Hate Crimes Working Group (HCWG) states that NGOsare at the frontline in terms of supporting those who experience hate crimes, with43% of those who experience hate crimes contacting NGOs first, and only 26%going directly to the police, with the remainder contacting other organisations orhealthcare facilities (Lepodise, 2018).A legal victory linked to the reporting of hate crimes emerged in 2016, andagain in 2018, when the South African Department of Justice revised a Billdesigned to protect individuals from hate crimes, which was then approved byCabinet (De Barros, 2018). This Bill was named the Prevention and Combating ofHate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, and it has the criminalisation of hate crimes asits focus (De Barros, 2018). The Bill hopes to ensure swift punishment for thosewho perpetrate hate crimes, and it also aims to reduce the confusion surroundingthe reporting of hate crimes. What’s more, this Bill aims to provide improvedtraining and knowledge to law enforcement officers when it comes to the man-aging and prosecution of people who commit hate crimes. According to an onlinenews article by De Barros (2018), the Bill defines hate speech as the infliction ofhate ‘on the basis of age, albinism, birth, colour, culture, disability, ethnic orsocial origin, gender or gender identity, HIV status, language, nationality,migrant or refugee status, race, religion, or sex, which includes intersex or sexualorientation’.Constitutional Protection and Prejudice 111Despite formalisation in hate crimes legislation, LGBTQ1 people continue toface challenges in reporting hate crimes. The OUT survey from 2016, the sameyear the Bill was introduced, reported that an astounding 88% of LGBTQ1people do not report discrimination experiences to the police. Most LGBTQ1people polled mention that this is often due to the fact that they do not believethat their reports will be taken seriously. What’s more, some LGBTQ1 people donot openly reveal their sexualities in their communities, and they fear thatreporting incidents of discrimination may cause their hidden sexualities to becomeknown by members of the community they live in (OUT, 2016).In an article in Indian Spice e-zine, Khan (2018) encourages LGBTQ1 peoplein South Africa to reach out for help and persevere in reporting hate crimes. Hebelieves that often, people do not know how to report hate crimes, and they needto be educated. This is where he sees an important role for himself: the sharing ofinformation and knowledge on experiences and legislation related to hate crimes.‘I want the LGBTQ1 community to know that you DO have a voice and thereare options [… to] protect yourself from hate speech and much more’ (Khan,2018).Another reason for the under-reporting of hate crimes remains the scepticismfrom South African citizens, who believe that what exists on paper does notalways translate to real-life experiences (De Barros, 2016). In an online newsarticle about the reporting of discrimination experiences, De Barros (2016)argues: ‘Discrimination is experienced in everyday life and I don’t know if this willstop it. […] They pass these Bills but implementation is the problem’.LGBTQ1 people also believe that they may be discriminated against by thecourt systems, which are meant to be protecting them (OUT, 2016). The OUT(2016) survey, which has a special section focusing on the experiences ofLGBTQ1 people with the justice system, states that 25% of LGBTQ1 peoplewithdrew cases of hate crimes, and a further 7% were too afraid to report to court.Those who withdrew cases or failed to report to courts may fear secondary vic-timisation. The reporting of hate crimes may also lead to secondary victimisationif they are not handled correctly (Nel & Judge, 2008). This secondary victim-isation occurs when those who report hate crimes and discrimination are blamedby community members for the crimes that are reported, leading to social,emotional and psychological effects (Campbell & Raja, 2005). But it does not stopthere: in addition to these personal and legal challenges, there are also reports thatsome LGBTQ1 people feel discriminated against when using healthcare services(OUT, 2016; Polders & Wells, 2004).In essence, Lerato Phalakatshela, Hate Crime Manager at OUT LGBTQ1Well-Being, in an interview with De Barros (2016), simply states the sad realitythat: ‘People don’t trust the system’ (De Barros, 2016). This was further affirmedby Dawie Nel, the Director of OUT LGBTQ1 Well-Being, who also mentionedthe very long response time for receiving assistance from law enforcement officers(De Barros, 2016). ‘…it took more than 30 phone calls to get hold of the inves-tigating officer’ (De Barros, 2016).Upon reporting hate crimes, LGBTQ1 people further mention that they didnot find the police very helpful (OUT, 2016), and this led to low confidence in112 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayalreporting hate crimes. In an older study by Polders and Wells (2004), 33% ofLGBTQ1 people reported negative experiences when reporting hate crimes atpolice stations. Judging by the statistics from these two separate studies, it appearsthat not much has changed between 2004 and 2016, and that South AfricanLGBTQ1 people continue to experience difficulties when reporting hate crimes –despite the major legal reforms.“Fear, Humiliation, Shame”The problems with reporting hate crimes may be due to institutional limitations.However, there are also personal factors at play that impact hate crime reporting,and a person’s inhibitions and fears during the reporting process may restrict onefrom seeking assistance after incidents of discrimination (De Barros, 2018). Thefear of reporting hate crimes is high among LGBTQ1 people: OUT (2016)reported that 55% of LGBTQ1 people displayed high levels of fear of beingdiscriminated against due to their sexual orientation. De Barros, based on theviews of those assisting those who experience hate crimes, writes: ‘emotionalchanges were noted, including fear, humiliation, shame, loss of trust andpowerlessness’ (De Barros, 2018).Hate crimes are also reported differently by people of different genders, asespecially men who experienced hate crimes felt embarrassed about reportingthem (Louw, 2014). These men felt that there are social pressures to behave instrong and assertive ways, and reporting experiences of discrimination causesthese men to feel ashamed and ‘lesser than’ (Louw, 2014). People who experiencehate crimes may also experience self-blaming attitudes, where they may start tobelieve that they are the cause of their negative experiences, which results in thembeing embarrassed to speak to other people (Hill & Zautra, 1989).The fear of reprisals from those who perpetrate hate crimes is also a constantfear of people reporting hate crimes (OUT, 2016; Sampson & Phillips, 1996).People who report crimes feel exhausted by the fact that they may need tochallenge societal views and community attitudes in the process of seeking justice.They believe that they may not be able to cope with repeated victimisation andtrauma, should they be discriminated against (Louw, 2014). What is evident isthat discrimination against LGBTQ1 people leads to emotional and self-esteemdifficulties in people who experience them (OUT, 2016), often leading to veryserious life challenges.“It All Starts With a Joke…Next…Someone Has Committed Suicide”The negative psychological, emotional and interpersonal challenges faced byLGBTQ1 people due to discrimination have been noted in many studies acrossdifferent countries. Hate crimes may involve threatening messages which causeLGBTQ1 people to feel unsafe and unwanted in their communities, andLGBTQ1 people feel restricted and inhibited in their daily interpersonal rela-tionships due to the negative impacts of hate crimes. The South African HateConstitutional Protection and Prejudice 113Crimes Working Group concluded that 50% of people experiencing hate crimesexperienced emotional challenges; 7% experienced mental health effects; 35%experienced economic impacts and among 27% of LGBTQ1 people, negativeliving environments were experienced (Lepodise, 2018).Muhsin Hendricks, a religious leader from South Africa, shares in an interviewwith Sheldon (2016), that hate crimes lead to challenges within communities,testing social cohesion and leading to a threatened feeling of physical and psy-chological well-being. Muhsin speaks of the impact of religion as well: ‘There area lot of lives being destroyed based on sexuality and religion, and that needs tochange’ (Sheldon, 2016). Though the legal changes are necessary andcommendable, there needs to be constructive change within communities in orderto allow for LGBTQ1 people to feel safer and accepted within their communities.Most LGBTQ1 people live in communities that are heterosexist, and they aresurrounded by symbols and attitudes that often marginalise them (Herek, Gillis,& Cogan, 1999). This marginalisation can also lead to feelings of internalisedhomophobia. This type of homophobia is defined as ‘the gay person’s direction ofnegative social attitudes toward the self, leading to a devaluation of the self andresultant internal conflicts and poor self-regard’ (Meyer & Dean, 1998, p. 161).This internalised homophobia is often learned before LGBTQ1 people may beaware of their sexual orientation, as they may be raised in societies where theycome into contact with homophobic messages; and the experiences of levels ofself-devaluation is an inevitable part of identity development (Herek et al., 1999;Meyer, 1995). For LGBTQ1 people who are affiliated with communities that donot affirm different sexual orientations, a higher level of internalised homophobiais noted (Barnes & Meyer, 2012).Internalised homophobia is also shown to decrease self-esteem, reduce moti-vation and may also affect intimacy and affection (Gormley & Lopez, 2010;Meyer & Dean, 1998). An extreme psychological challenge of internalisedhomophobia is its tendency to cause depersonalisation, where people who expe-rience discrimination may feel detached and isolated from others (Rosenberg,2000). The Right to Care organisation, an NGO in South Africa, echoes the viewof researchers that LGBTQ1 people are more prone to suffering mental healthchallenges, substance abuse and extreme stress (Igual, 2018). It has also beenidentified that discrimination and microaggressions lead to workplace challengesamong South African gay men (Dayal, 2021). A 2019 study on 27 South Africancorporate companies and multinational organisations highlighted that despiteprogressive company policies protecting LGBTQ1 people, many of the policiesare administrative and that practically, work needs to continuously be done toensure that diversity policies are being implemented (The South AfricanLGBTQ1 Management Forum, 2018, 2019). This, again, shows the paradox ofinstitutional progressiveness and cultural resistance.The damaging impact of media in perpetuating discrimination againstLGBTQ1 people was highlighted by Khan (2018), in his online review of a recentSouth African movie focusing on the South African Indian community. Themovie, Broken Promises, showcased examples of heteronormativity and homo-negative dialogues, in which gay men were used for comic relief. Using gay men in114 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayaloverly effeminate roles tends to create narrow views of gay men. These gay menare made out to be out-group members, and seen as deviant and subordinate.Negative associations with LGBTQ1 characters were also identified with moviesmade in India’s Bollywood cinema (Kaur, 2017). This may lead to incidents ofdiscrimination and hate speech, and even emotional challenges. Khan (2018)vehemently states: ‘It all starts with a joke and the next thing you know someonehas committed suicide’ (Khan, 2018). In another news article, a South AfricanIndian mother speaks of the emotional pain her son endured due to homophobicabuse and repeated bullying: ‘[He] attempted suicide twice. He consumed all of hisanti-depressants’ (Jagmohan, 2017).The South African Human Science Research Council in a 2016 study revealedthat 31% of LGBTQ1 people have thought of suicide, and this statistic is wellabove the national average, further indicating the vulnerability of LGBTQ1people (Igual, 2018). The South African Depression and Anxiety Group, an NGOproviding counselling and support, reveals that LGBTQ1 people may be twice aslikely to attempt suicide (SADAG, 2017). Among those who have thoughts ofsuicide, SADAG (2017) believes that Indian gay men experience cultural pres-sures and pressures from Indian media representations of men and gay men, thatmake them more vulnerable to mental health challenges. Many NGOs and othersupport organisations in South Africa work together to encourage a culture ofsupport and reduced discrimination. However, it is also important for parents tonote the damaging impact of discrimination on their children. As a concernedSouth African mother states in an interview with Independent Online: ‘Parentsneed to listen to their children. We need to stop criticising and let people live’(Jagmohan, 2017).Families have an important role to play in promoting self-acceptance amongLGBTQ1 people. Family support allows for a positive self-image and greaterpsychological well-being (Ryan, Russell, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2010).LGBTQ1 people show a reduction of mental health challenges if they have a safespace to live in. Family members and community members have an instrumentalrole to play in creating this safe space.ConclusionSouth Africa’s history of violence and oppression is well documented in all formsof academic literature and mainstream media (Hirsch, 2005). During the time ofSouth Africa’s democratic transition, South Africa served as a beacon of hope formany nations. However, over two decades post-democracy, South Africa con-tinues to experience crime and violence at a high rate. Despite sound legislationand Constitutional protection, South African citizens continue to face difficulties.Among South African citizens experiencing challenges, LGBTQ1 people inSouth Africa are particularly vulnerable (Khan, 2017). Hate crimes againstLGBTQ1 people happen at alarming rates (OUT, 2016). These hate crimes resultin a sense of fear and humiliation, and intense mental health and emotionalchallenges among those who experience hate crimes. Due to infrastructureConstitutional Protection and Prejudice 115concerns and a lack of confidence in the justice system (OUT, 2016; StatisticsSouth Africa, 2017), there are a lower amount of crimes being reported. In orderto sustain social cohesion and remedy tears in the social fabric, societies need tostand together in promoting the acceptance of all members.ReferencesBarnes, D. M., & Meyer, I. H. (2012).

As with the previous introductorydialogues, the discussion takes place after preliminary drafts have beencompleted and the authors share their thoughts on the subjects that they willeach discuss in more detail in the following chapters. These include theculture of silence surrounding rape in India, the way masculine gender normsimpact the treatment of women in Japan and the cultural factors that drivemicroaggressions targeted at LGBTQ1 people in South Africa.Keywords: Gender violence; gender norms; society; Japan; India; SouthAfricaGray: Nidhi, in an earlier chapter you asked me to comment on the commodi-fication of the ‘lolita’ culture. It’s something I examine in more depth in theupcoming chapter, but there is very definitely a sexualisation and commodifica-tion of schoolgirls that is extremely bad for Japan’s international image. It has areputation for this highly sexualised ‘lolita’ imagery, whether in books, games,animation or its music industry. However, this element of fetishisation is verylocalised to specific cultural groups, and sexual elements of it are rarely seen ingeneral daily life. While Japan does have a semi-open sex industry, everyday life isfar less sexualised than the West in terms of music, television and advertising.Gender Violence, the Law, and Society, 123–129Copyright © 2022 Gavan Patrick Gray, Nidhi Shrivastava and Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

There is an element of Japanese culture that simply prizesyouth and views the high school years in particular as one of the ideal stages oflife. As a result, the commodification of this age, which is the focus of some of thecountry’s most popular TV shows and pop groups, is not simply about sexualitybut about people’s emotional connection to that period. This extends to thingssuch as Papa Katsu,1 insofar as it is not always a sexual exchange that is involvedbut sometimes a purely emotional one, i.e. the men involved pay for the facade ofan emotional relationship, rather than simply for sex, often as a response to aninability to form emotionally open relationships in their ‘real’ lives.This does not, of course, make it healthier for either party, but it does make thesituation a little more complex than it is often portrayed. At one extreme you havethe focus on youth, which has its own genre called seishun in Japan, as a period ofinnocence, strong emotional bonds and boundless possibility, which is the sellingpoint of so many TV dramas and idol groups. Then, at a mid-point ofcommodification, you have Papa Katsu, which is an exchange that can be eitheremotionally or sexually motivated. At the alternate far end, you have the moreextreme sexual commodification of youth that can be seen in sexually explicitanimation and DVDs featuring young children in skimpy clothes.Dayal: And, is this, these products, are they legal in Japan?Gray: Part of the problem is that the issue has yet to be treated, at a legal orpolitical level, with the severity that it deserves. Possession of child pornographywas only banned in Japan in 2015 and a casual attitude toward the sexualisationof children still seems commonplace, something I would personally ascribe towidespread ignorance of the extent of the problem rather than indifference to itseffects. This links back to what I mentioned at the beginning of this book; Japan isgenerally a very safe and relatively chaste society, and people tend to avoidlooking into or examining the more shadowy areas where problematic behaviouris often rampant. Like many elements of Japanese culture, its more extremesegments tend to get more attention overseas than they do in Japan itself. So,while most Japanese people do not often see the dark side of this area, it issomething that international audiences have come to associate with Japan. In alllikelihood, it will be these international views that generate sufficient pressure forthe government to finally take stronger action in protecting young people fromsexual predation.Dayal: There are many places in the world that do not share the same view onsexual and gender violence. It is important that all countries equally consider theseriousness of these crimes.Gray: That’s right. And it’s one of the key reasons why we’re looking at thesealternative perspectives. In the European Union and United States, discussions of1A form of commodified dating discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.124 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.gender violence or sexual crimes – while still dark and sensitive – have becomerelatively easy to examine in both social and institutional terms. But, in so manyother parts of the world, there are these extra barriers where the social stigma isstill placed on the victim and where there can be a distinct lack of support servicesto provide mental and emotional care for them.Shrivastava: Actually, that’s the common thread for all three of us, I think: thatthere are additional factors in some societies and cultures, things like shame,family honour or collective identity that can place additional burdens and stressupon women and that are not necessarily taken into account by standard Westernapproaches to these issues.Dayal: Some families seem almost embarrassed when a member tells themwhat happened to them and the most important thing is that they don’t wantanybody to know about it.Shrivastava: This reminds me of my dissertation work, where I came across thestory of a son, who was mad at his mother for not killing herself as a way toprotect the family honour. So he just refused to acknowledge her existence. Butit’s another kind of silencing, the failure of not just communities but families toacknowledge victimhood.Dayal: I feel, for me, with the studies that I look at regarding South Africangay men, there’s this idea of just being a man or, rather, that you’re less of a man,if you speak about any kind of problem with sexual or gender violence. They aretold that they’re ‘being a sissy’ or to ‘man up’. Even when they just want to beopen with their family they’re not even given that relief due to the social barriersthat can prevent basic discussion of some topics. It’s such a tragedy.Shrivastava: With sexual violence, another problem, in India at least, is thatagainst young girls it is always private and usually with a relative, within theextended family. And, in these cases, it is the family’s reputation that can be seenas the most important thing to protect, which gives power to the perpetrator. Itcan even empower them to do it again or to feel comfortable doing similar thingsto other people.Dayal: Focusing on the perpetrator. Because, obviously, one has to go into‘why do they behave the way that they do’ and, I think, some of these perpetratorssay ‘you know, well, this is just how we were brought up’ or ‘this is just the waysociety moulded’ and they reject any personal responsibility for their behaviour.Gray: And, of course, that rings false because, if it was true, you’d have anentire generation who were brought up under those social values all acting thesame way, and they don’t. Some develop quite liberal, open-minded views, andit’s only a small group of them that end up with these warped patterns ofbehaviour. But these social forces can certainly influence people in these direc-tions, create pressure to follow negative patterns or hold negative views of womenand minorities. And they can certainly be used by them to justify their behaviourrather than reflecting upon it as a personal failing.Shrivastava: This links to what I focus on in my chapter, which is that there is aculture of silence in India, again regarding certain elements of society that peoplelike to avoid looking at. And recently there has emerged a trend in terms of howfilmmakers are trying to change the conversation on rape victim-survivors. ThereGender-Based Violence and Society 125are multiple ways in which the silence exists, both in the public and private sphere,and one is that the media tend to be quiet about the names or identities of rapesurvivors, even where they have publicly spoken out, and so feminists argue thatthey are taking away the identity of the women and reducing them to just statisticswhich isn’t fair to them.There is often an attitude of, like, whatever happened to you, it’s a personalthing and we don’t want to hear about it and don’t need to think about it. Asthough it will be harmful to them or for society for awareness of these crimes tobecome more widely known. The same thing happens with child sexual abuse,even more so in that case because usually the criminal is someone the victimknows, and so there is more pressure to keep things quiet. This is something thatfilmmakers are trying to disrupt by showing that these problems exist, and thatthey exist everywhere, across caste and class.Gray: Where I’m coming from in this section is a little different. For my finalchapter, I’m looking at how male gender norms, or specific variants of them,affect the way that women are treated both on an individual and institutionallevel. People often talk about ‘toxic masculinity’, but it’s incredibly reductive asthere are many types of masculinity, many of which are culturally specific, andmore than one of which can be quite negative in the way it views or treats women.Shrivastava: I’m actually reading a book at the moment called The Damage byCaitlin Wahrer, and it looks at the issue of rape among gay men, so I think it’sboth an example of what you mean by different types of harmful masculinity butalso another culture of silence where the majority of people are still so uncom-fortable with this topic and don’t know how to discuss it openly.Gray: That’s part of what I’m looking at, in that some topics are silenced at thesocial level, where you are affecting others, or at least others feel you are affectingthem, by speaking about it. But some topics are silenced at the personal levelbecause we don’t learn how to express ourselves or engage with the issues on anemotional level. In Japan, with many instances of men who have poor connec-tions with women, it seems to stem from the social pressures that relegate thedevelopment of male emotional bonds to an insignificant level of priority.When this kind of thing becomes generational you have young men growingup with emotionally removed father figures and so they see wives as being thesame as mothers and having a very specific social role. The idea of treating themas equals, whether as friends, lovers or colleagues, becomes somewhat alien tothem, and when they encounter a new type of woman who is less traditional andmore assertive, they react with discomfort, fear or anger. And the real problem isthat they don’t have the emotional or communicative toolset to deal with theseissues in an open and healthy manner. Again, this doesn’t apply to all men, but itis common enough in Japan to be noticeable.Dayal: This inability to communicate and to understand or properly expresstheir emotions is something that I have also come across in relation to myresearch on microaggressions. When you see men who react negatively to gaymen, often it is because the subject of homosexuality itself was taboo so there wasnever any discussion about it. And so when they encounter not just gay men, buteven men who are comfortable emotionally, they react by being nasty and126 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.labelling them as effeminate or unmasculine because they feel they can show theyare not gay by being nasty to anyone who is gay or even displays femininity.Gray: It’s exactly the same with men showing more misogynist tendencies, aninability to interact comfortably with women, I think due to a lack of emotionallyopen male role models, creates hostility toward women.Dayal: The idea of men communicating in an emotional way needs to benormalised.Gray: I wonder, Nidhi, you focus on the use of media more than either of us,do you think there is a shift in how media is addressing these issues? Do you feel itis helping raise awareness, or helping break open the Overton Window in a waythat lets young people access or discuss topics that were formerly taboo?Shrivastava: Well, some of the films I actually look at address this topic in away, for example the 2014 film called Highway, in which the daughter of awealthy industrialist is kidnapped by a gang of lower-class men. However, the girldevelops a bond with one of them and they share their tales of how they bothexperienced childhood abuse. In the end, this gives the girl the confidence toconfront her family and her abuser and to challenge the culture of silence they hadsupported.Another film is called Article 15 from 2019, which is an even darker storyabout two girls who were gang-raped and murdered and how caste differencesaffect attitudes toward and investigation of the crimes. Finally, I also look atBombay Begums, a recent TV drama on Netflix about a group of women whoeach have personal challenges to overcome, which highlights social problemsaffecting women that rarely get this kind of coverage in the media. So, you cankind of see that media, especially more international types like Netflix, aretouching on topics that would have been hard to do in the past.Gray: And this, again, kind of goes back to something we mentioned in the lastsection, which was that you have a middle-class who are highlighting problemsthat are affecting less well-off groups, or, in some cases, which are universal.Shrivastava: Yes, I suppose that the awareness raised by these movies andshows, especially through Netflix, are accessible, though somewhat middle-class,in India at least. So, it is good in that it might be creating a wider understandingof different issues, or even creating a new set of future activists, but it is probablynot doing a lot to change attitudes or cultural norms at lower economic levels. Butmaybe there is a chance that they might disrupt the silence. So while there aresome problems with the pathway, I think it can be good if it can change theaudience from being passive into being activists, not just being aware of theproblems but actually doing something to address them.Gray: In your case, you see media as a way of broadening this awareness. Inmy own chapter, I highlight education as the way to improve and inform people’sunderstanding, especially young people. But it’s clear, I think, that there aremultiple paths that these messages can take and that, ideally, they would bereinforcing one another.Dayal: Actually, that’s precisely what I am looking at in my final chapter: theintersectionality of the messages and pressures that produce these problems –coming from family, from culture, from religion – and how they kind of workGender-Based Violence and Society 127upon each other to put down these layers that can end up silencing people. I guessyou are looking in the opposite direction, at how positive layers of messaging canhelp lift that blanket of silence and give people a greater voice or more freedom.Gray: Well, this is one area where education, I think, has a greater reach thanmedia. In Japan, there is a very low level of effective sex education in schools. Ithink there might be a conservative view that if junior high school kids beginlearning about sex then they will start having sex and teen pregnancies willincrease, when, generally, the opposite is true and better education tends toprevent that. More importantly, it’s an area, encompassing human relationshipsand emotional ties, that is frequently overlooked in education and which offershuge potential for preemptively addressing many social problems.Dayal: Yes, if I can just pick up on that regarding microaggressions. It is anarea that is still not clearly defined, and it is not something people really speakabout. Instead, hate crimes and hate speech are far more common, and there isstill such a lack of understanding of the other forms of abuse that are expressedmore covertly. I think these undercurrents of discrimination are an area whereeducation can be used to raise awareness.Gray: Is there, do you think, a danger in that the media often focuses on moredramatic instances of abuse or discrimination, and that sometimes the more subtleforms get overlooked or even dismissed as being ‘less important’, even though, aswe are well aware, the subtle and constant pervasive effect can be equally harmfulover the long term?Dayal: Well, I think there is that element of the overt and covert forms, andthat the former definitely receives more attention. But you also tend to see issuesof sexual discrimination being lumped in with gender discrimination, and in thelatter field, the focus tends to be less on the experiences of men. So, to someextent, the stories of men, whether gay men or male rape, tend to be a little moresilenced in that they don’t receive the same kind of media attention, at least.Shrivastava: Just to touch on that, perhaps you are speaking about newsmedia, but I wanted to mention a show I saw calledMade in Heaven, which is oneof the few entertainment representations of gay Indian men that I have seen. Itincludes things like harassment from the police and also, I think, the subject ofrape. I think this is part of that movement by activists or feminist filmmakers totackle these kinds of untouched subjects. This show was made by Amazon, and Ithink these online services are offering room for more of this kind of activistentertainment to be introduced.Gray: From what I have seen as well, I only really know of Netflix, but theyseem to be doing a good job of finding and nurturing regional talent. So they canintroduce more liberal issues, but do it in a way that it is coming more organicallyfrom within the region and made by people who properly understand the regionand its complexities.Shrivastava: Yes, the online platforms allow for less censorship and regulation,although now the Indian Government is trying to catch up on it. They’re startingto kind of say, ‘Okay, we want you to know we’ll start banning Netflix orwhatever, or some of your shows, if you don’t make these changes’. And it’sthings like, in Bombay Begums there was a whole section on menstruation and the128 Gavan Patrick Gray et al.government. Some media were saying it has a negative effect on women bysexualising them faster, which is obviously nonsense. What it is doing is creating aspace for dialogue and education that wasn’t there when I was growing up. Icertainly couldn’t speak to my mother comfortably about anything connected tosex when I was younger, and that is changing. But, it may be that it is changingmostly for the middle class and the urban residents, and that the lower class andrural people are still trapped by these kinds of barriers and old-fashionedattitudes.Gray: We have been speaking a lot of the importance of Western researchersand activists being aware of the complexities of other regions and cultures, but it’sgood that you point out how important it is to remember that even where suc-cessful efforts are being made to introduce more progressive values in a culturallyinformed manner, there are still groups locally that are unlikely to have access tothose messages. It’s so important to build direct connections with the people whoare most directly affected, and I think one of the privileges we have is that whilethose people often cannot travel to other countries or meet the people in themwho might share their problems or live in similar circumstances, we can act as abridge of sorts, to help build connections and share information on thoseunderreported areas.Shrivastava: This is why speaking like this, or meeting at conferences, is soimportant: it allows us to really explore and understand the issues in a morecomplete way that really brings the focus back to the human element of the issuesand the fact that it is not an abstract problem but things that affect real peopleeach and every day.Dayal: I couldn’t agree more. I know I can learn a lot from reading thechapters that you have written, but having a chance to speak with you andexplore these issues in a more natural manner makes a huge difference, both inhelping to understand the topic and also in bringing home its reality.Gender-Based Violence and Society 129This page intentionally left blankChapter 7India – Rape and the Prevalent Culture ofSilence in Indian Cinema and TelevisionNidhi ShrivastavaAbstractIn this chapter, I explore two media texts, Imtiaz Ali’s Highway andAlankrita Shrivastava’s Netflix original series Bombay Begums (2021). Icontend that recent filmmakers have begun to arguably reframe the narra-tives of rape victim-survivors and disrupting the cultural of silence describedabove. They offer progressive and multi-faceted representations of theseexperiences, such that there is an opportunity for a dialogue within bothprivate and public spheres. What I mean when I say that they are ‘pro-gressive representations’ is that the rape victim-survivors are not merelyreduced to helpless women in distress, nor painted as vengeful, aggressivecharacters. Instead, their characterisation shows that they have agency andautonomy, but at the same time struggle with the repercussions of speakingout against their perpetrators in a society that does not support them wholly.Keywords: #MeToo movement; India; caste system; class; honour; silenceIn a thought-provoking article, Krupa Shandilya (2015) calls attention to theconstruction of Jyoti Singh Pandey aka Nirbhaya, the victim of the 2012 Delhirape case ‘both as “everywoman” and as a middle-class, upper-caste, Hinduwoman’ (p. 465). She then furthers her argument that ‘despite feminist inter-ventions that call attention to the intersections of caste, class and gender, thebodies of lower-caste, lower-class, non-Hindu rural women are excluded fromprotest movements’ (p. 406). For Shandilya, the reason for their exclusion is that‘mainstream Indian feminist demand for legal reform is premised on a normativesubject – the Hindu, middle-class women.

Her study,thus, makes ‘evident that none of these cases have captured the public imagina-tion in the same way as the Nirbhaya rape case’ (Shandilya, p. 479). Shandilya’sstudy underscores that contemporary Indian rape culture rests on the intersectionof caste, class, gender, honour and shame, but that mainstream movements andpopular culture tend to exclude lower caste/class women and rape victim/survivors who exist on the margins. Debolina Dutta and Oishik Sircar (2013),in agreement with Shandilya, further observe, ‘location and identity thus seem tobe essential qualifiers in determining whose rape is worth being the subject ofurban, middle-class concern and rage’ (p. 298).Shandilya, Dutta and Sircar convey the notion that rape discourses in theIndian public privilege certain narratives – such as the Nirbhaya gang-rape case –in the mainstream media and popular culture. While they are correct in pointingout that the narratives of rape survivor-victims who exist are silenced, I wouldfurther add that their analysis demonstrates that by the proliferation of theNirbhaya rape case in the national and international mediascapes, there is aproblematic circulation of the notion that rapists and perpetrators primarilybelong to the downtrodden, economically disadvantaged and less educated clas-ses. Here, we see the culture of silence manifest on mainstream media channelswhere urban, upper and middle-class rapists and paedophiles are protected frombeing held responsible for their crimes. This type of silence exists especially inprivate spheres; there is often no recognition or acknowledgement of the rape and/or sexual assault by the families of the rape victim-survivors, as if the crime neveroccurred at the first place. In turn, the rape victim-survivors are re-traumatisedagain after the incident. Often, family members persuade and coax them toremain quiet, and, if they choose to speak up, they blame them for bringingdishonour and shame to the family. Because of this, the perpetrator’s crimes nevercome to the forefront and, thus, they are not held responsible for their crimes.In this chapter, I contend that recently filmmakers have begun reframing thenarratives of rape victim-survivors and disrupting the cultural of silence describedabove. They offer progressive and multi-faceted representations of these experi-ences, such that there is an opportunity for a dialogue within both private andpublic spheres. What I mean when I say that they are ‘progressive representations’is that the rape victim-survivors are not merely reduced to helpless women indistress, nor painted as vengeful, aggressive characters. Instead, their characteri-sation shows that they have agency and autonomy, but at the same time strugglewith the repercussions of speaking out against their perpetrators in a society thatdoes not support them wholly. The two media texts I explore are Imtiaz Ali’sHighway (2014) and Alankrita Shrivastava’s Netflix original series BombayBegums (2021).There has been a noticeable shift in the way in which rape victim-survivors arerepresented in mainstream popular culture. In the 1970s and 1980s, rape victimswere either depicted as archetypical poor, helpless, lower class women or as132 Nidhi Shrivastavavigilantes who sought violent revenge for their trauma (Gopalan, 2008; Karki,2019; Virdi, 2003). These films also saw the creation of the main protagonist whowas fighting the system (government, rich and corrupt landlords and bandits) forsocial justice and represented the ordinary/everyday man or woman. Pascal Zinck(2019) observes that such films arelocated in remote rural areas governed by zamindar/thakur [Hindi:feudal landlords]. In these films, the message is to frame violenceagainst women as a critique of patriarchy and feudalism versusmodernity. The danger with this binary is to consciously orsubconsciously manufacture a consensus in middle-class viewingaudience that avoids antagonizing masculinity, and ultimately,exonerates urban sex abusers(p. 273; emphasis added).In the two media texts that I examine in this chapter, we see that the film-makers focus on the figure of the urban rapist and perpetrator and shifts awayfrom the common representation of gender-based violence as an issue that is facedby people who exist on society’s margins. By doing this, both Shrivastava’s andAli’s messages remain that child sexual abuse and gender-based violence are notrelegated to the poor, lower class parts of the society. Rather, they take place inboth the public and private spheres of the elite and upper middle classes. At thesame time, both filmmakers also re-imagine the rape victim-survivor, who ischaracterised with complexities and nuance as she confronts the perpetrator inboth media texts. It is apparent that these filmmakers are trying to shift theconversation to draw attention to the culture of silence surrounding rape andgender-based violence that exists within the upper and upper-middle class spheres.While the filmmakers do not elide the viewers from the violence that women fromlower-class experience and encounter, they are not afraid to show thatupper-caste/class men are equally responsible but are often able to escapeconviction or recognition of their crime because of the culture of silence thatprotects them.Re-imagining the Vengeful Rape Victim-Survivor: ImtiazAli’s HighwayImtiaz Ali’s Highway paints a multi-layered picture of rape victim-survivors. Thefilm begins with Veera Tripathi (Alia Bhatt), a rich tycoon’s daughter, meetingsecretly with her fiancée to escape the ongoing wedding celebrations in her home.They drive too far and bear witness to a robbery. In a frenzy, the criminals kidnapher and take her with them to the crevices of India’s poor neighbourhoods. Hisfellow criminals reprimand the kidnapper – Mahabir (Randeep Hooda) – forabducting Veera, and fear reprisal from her wealthy family. Mahabir is an angryand frustrated man, tired of the atrocities he had to face because he belongs to thelower class in India. He sees Tripathi as a consignment – a method by which heIndia – Rape and the Prevalent Culture of Silence 133can make the rich class suffer. As their relationship develops, he reminds her thathe is a man with a criminal past who has committed three murders and is on therun. Although initially Veera makes desperate attempts to escape from Mahabir’sgrip and is accosted sexually by one of the kidnappers in his group, we see astrong bond develop between Mahabir and Veera as the plot thickens. Towardsthe end of the film, Veera and Mahabir escape the society that has caused themtrauma and grief and create a utopic home for themselves in the mountains. Theirhappiness is short-lived as the police team is able to locate Veera and shootMahabir on the spot. He is declared dead upon arrival at the police hospital.Veera, in a shock, begs her family members to allow her to see Mahabir but she isgiven a tranquilizer and brought back to Delhi to recover.At the heart of this powerful film is a very sensitive issue that many people fearto speak about. Unfortunately, rape and sexual abuse of young children areunspoken commonalities in India. No one speaks about them publicly because itcan tarnish reputation and honour of families. The perpetrators are not heldaccountable for their criminal offense and in order to protect the honour offamilies rich or poor, women and men grow up traumatised, unable to compre-hend the contradictions that are before them. Both Veera’s and Mahabir’smothers are victims of such a society. Veera’s uncle and family friend had rapedVeera since the age of nine, luring her with chocolates and gifts. Her own motherstops her from speaking the truth and forces her into behaving as if everything isnormal. Mahabir, on the other hand, bears witness to his mother’s abuse whenshe is prostituted by his own father to cater to the needs of rich men. While wehear of Mahabir’s upbringing and his mother’s sexual abuse, we do not hear fromher and can only access her through Mahabir’s memories.The film alludes to a glaring issue that rarely gets taken up in the socio-politicalfabric of India: it suggests that rape and sexual abuse over-rides class complexitieswithin India because women and young girls are subjected to it regardless of theirclass status. Perhaps the most powerful moment in the film is when Veera con-fronts her family. She says, ‘growing up, you told me to be careful of strangersoutside our home but you never told me that I should be careful inside my hometoo’ (Ali & Nadiadwala, 2014, 1:58:56–1:59:31). This is a defining momentbecause Veera’s confrontation takes place within the home when her family isre-introducing her to her fiancée in the hope that she will marry him regardless ofthe trauma that she experienced. At that moment, she realises that her perpe-trator, Shukla Uncle, is also in the same room. She is not afraid to speak of theabuse she suffered by his hand as a child and shares with her entire family andfriends that he used to rape and molest her by tempting her with importedchocolates. When her rapist is put on the spot, he calls her crazy and flees from thehouse. The most touching moment is when she screams in pain as her childhoodtrauma manifests and breaks the silence that she is encountered all her life. Yet,her family is shown to be lost and confused – unable to handle the truth that shehas confronted them with. This is a significant moment because it shows that dueto the culture of silence within the upper classes, there is ambivalence andconfusion about how to confront this sensitive subject matter. Eventually, Veerashares her decision to leave her family and start a new life working a regular job134 Nidhi Shrivastavaand leading an independent life where she, rather than her family or society,dictates the course of her life.This is a significant shift in the representation of rape victim-survivors who, inthe 1980s, belonged to the tradition of avenging women genre in Bollywood. Thefilms Insaaf Ka Tarazu and Pink, which I discussed at length in the chapter onlaw, still explore the figure of the avenging rape victim-survivor. Isha Karki (2019)rightfully points out that although the rape-revenge device ‘provided actresseswith dominant roles’ (p. 91), at the same time, ‘a world of female agency wasimagined where women became powerful, and utilised what is coded as masculinepower, because of their violent initiation into victimhood – and even then, theirrage had to be justified by their identity as a “good victim”’ (p. 91). Unlike in theearlier films, Highway approaches the concept of rape revenge in a differentmanner. Rather than physically attacking or killing him, Veera shames andconfronts her perpetrator in front of her family members, her fiancée and hisfamily. Given the taboo and cultural silencing that exists within the Indiansociety, this is the first time we see that the rape survivor-victim is demandingjustice vis-à-vis a conversation with her family members and relatives who havebeen quiet throughout the sexual abuse she suffered as a child. As mentionedearlier, Uncle Shukla quickly removes himself from the scene and disappears fromthe narrative so that as audiences, we do not know if he was punished for hispedophilic and criminal behavior. Interestingly, the film received mixed reviewsfrom critics. Anupama Chopra (2014), for example only gave it a 2 and half starsand called it a ‘problematic film’ that left her ‘dissatisfied’ in her review. ForChopra, while the narratives of the ‘damaged’ characters is compelling, she fearsthat the film promotes the idea that ‘kidnapping is therapy’. Ronnie Schieb(2014), on the other hand writes, ‘abduction paradoxically results in liberation forboth the sheltered daughter of an industrialist and her hardened criminal…’ buthe is more optimistic and suggests that the film ‘should score with Indian aud[iences] globally, with arthouse cover as a distinct possibility’. From their reviews,it is apparent that the theme of kidnapping and abduction superseded the char-acterisation of both Veera and Mahabir. However, I do not agree with Choprashows that kidnapping is an acceptable form of therapy – rather the abductiontransforms both the characters and forces them to reflect on their respective lives.While Veera recognises that she does not want to depend on the wealth of herfamily members and wants to become autonomous, Mahabir softens and con-fronts his own demons that were caused by his father’s horrifying actions.Highway, therefore, portrays the rape survivor-victim as demanding justice byconfronting her perpetrator in front of her family and even questioning hermother for silencing her. Veera’s depiction is unlike other rape survivor-victims,who sought legal action and had no choice but to take the legal justice on theirhands, as can be seen in films like Insaaf ka Tarazu. Rather, here, Veera is facing asituation that would have left her ostracised from her family members andbrought shame to them. Instead, the film encourages rape survivor-victims tospeak up and even confront family members who may have protected theirrapists. Although a mainstream film, Ali speaks to a very current social issue thatneeds our attention. Honour and reputation are used as tools to silence voices ofIndia – Rape and the Prevalent Culture of Silence 135the innocent boys and girls who grow up in traumatic situations, not only as streetkids who witness atrocities but also in the luxurious homes of the rich wheresexual abuse and rape are kept under the rug to prevent shame and recognition oftheir trauma.#MeToo, Politics of Choice and Subjectivity in AlankritaShrivastava’s Bombay Begums (2021)In the last decade, feminist filmmakers such as Alankrita Shrivastava, AnvitaDutt, Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar have produced and released movies likeMade in Heaven (2019), Bulbul (2020) and, most recently, Bombay Begums (2021).Sharma and Sharma refers to the filmmakers who made the film Bulbul. Thesefilmmakers and directors use the web-streaming platforms Amazon Prime andNetflix to represent social issues such as male rape and homosexuality in Made inHeaven and a re-telling of the chudail (female demon) myth – calling attention tosexual violence and child marriages in the colonial Bengal during the British Raj –in Bulbul. Bulbul, the main protagonist of the latter movie, is transformed into ademon after her brutal rape, then returns to her village to murder and kill theperpetrator to demand justice and better treatment for women. It is clear thatBollywood is moving towards a new direction with these recent feminist film-makers who are not bound by the same censorship regulations as filmmakers inthe earlier decades. Furthermore, these shows are not limited to primarily Indianaudiences but make the stories accessible to audiences worldwide.Released in March 2021, Alankrita Shrivastava’s Bombay Begums focuses on the#MeToo movement and centers around narratives of ambitious women who havedifferent struggles and desires as they come together to work at Royal Bank ofBombay. The television series is centered on Rani (Pooja Bhatt) who is the CEO ofthe Royal Bank. She is married to Naushad Irani and stepmother to the series’narrator, Shai (Aadhya Anand). The women in this show belong to various classes,including Lily (Amruta Subhash), a prostitute who desires a better life for herselfand her son. We also meet Ayesha (Plabita Borthakur) who has moved from a smalltown to Bombay to pursue her dreams; as well as her boss Fatima (ShahanaGoswami), who struggles with infertility, IVF, marriage and career ambitions.Although the television series deals with relevant issues such as bisexuality, stigmaof menstruation and realisation of womanhood, it is an incident of workplace sexualviolence and harassment between Ayesha and her boss, Deepak Sanghvi (ManishChoudhary), that brings these women together. Deepak has a fierce competitionwith Rani and wants to become the bank’s next CEO. His family is also close toFatima and her husband. These web of relationships also further complicate theevents as they unfold when the issue of sexual violence and harassment come tolight. The television web series also demonstrates how female friendships are testedwhen the issue of sexual abuse becomes apparent in a work place.As audiences, we meet Ayesha when she is fired by Fatima in the first episode,after she miscalculates numbers that hinder Fatima’s meeting with foreign clients.From a small town, Ayesha is a young, determined and enthusiastic career girl136 Nidhi Shrivastavawho wants to make it in the finance industry in Bombay – a cosmopolitan cityakin to New York and London. The city culture does not favour single womenliving by themselves, best illustrated by her experiences living as a paying guest ina small home. After she is fired, she smokes and drinks to grieve and make senseof her job loss. Her landlady angrily throws her out of her home in the middle ofnight. Forced to find a place, Ayesha seeks shelter in her former office. In themorning, she encounters Rani in the bathroom. Being reminded of her earlierdays in the city, Rani takes pity and re-hires Ayesha. She is put on a project tohelp create a scheme to help women like Lily, the sex worker, have a financiallystable life and helps Lily realise her dream of opening a factory. Although Ayeshais initially happy with her job, she dreams of working with her mentor, DeepakSanghvi.When she meets Deepak at office party, she shares her desire to be mentored byhim. Initially, he does not take her seriously, observes that she is drinking cham-pagne, and treats like her like any other colleague. As the series continues, Deepakand Ayesha encounter each other again at another party. This time, Ayesha onceagain drinks and accepts the offer from Deepak to drop her off at her place of stay(her colleague Ron’s place, where she is temporarily staying). When they are in thecar, Deepak takes advantage of the situation and starts to touch her inappropri-ately. Lily, who by coincidence walks by, recognises Ayesha and witnesses the entireincident take place. At this time, for the audience, the extent of sexual violence thathas occurred between them is unclear. We see Ayesha shakily coming out of the car.The next day Lily reports of the incident she witnessed but Ayesha denies anywrongdoing and tries her best to move on so as to not destroy her chances ofmoving up in the company. As she remains quiet about the events, Fatima suspectsthat Ayesha was having an affair with Deepak and shames every time she sees her.Then, Ayesha is notified that Deepak has asked for her to be transferred into hisdepartment. Shocked and uneasy about her job placement, she reaches out to theHR to withdraw her application, but the HR officer in charge is surprised andquestions her decision. Ultimately, after another meeting with Deepak when she isout on a smoke with him, she is unable to keep the trauma in. In a panic, she runsinto the bathroom where she hastily tears the sexual harassment posters and finallygoes on a website where she reports the incident. To her surprise, another anony-mous woman reaches out to her and validates her experience with Deepak. Beingaware that Lily is her only witness, she gains courage to file a formal report in hercompany against Deepak. Fatima is still denial about the incident, knowing Deepakand his family intimately, and shows reluctance to believe Ayesha.In episode five, titled ‘The Golden Notebook’, Ayesha files the report, causingthe floodgates of investigation to open and transforming the relationships thatwere already fragile. In her testimony to her colleagues, she reveals that Deepakhas forced her to perform oral sex on him and says that she had no choice but togive into Deepak’s demands. She informs that she had resisted but it had been noavail: ‘I was scared of upsetting him. I was scared of what else he might do. I justwanted it to be over’ (Shrivastava, 2021, 10:29–11:01). Fatima and Rani deal withAyesha’s testimony in strongly diverging ways. Fatima behaves in apassive-aggressive manner, questioning Ayesha’s motives and character for notIndia – Rape and the Prevalent Culture of Silence 137coming forth earlier. In a conversation with Rani (who is insisting on followingdue process), Fatima shares her doubts that Deepak could be a sexual predator(Shrivastava, 2021, 12:14–12:16). In fact, she then starts to doubt Ayesha andaccuses her of changing her story, saying that everyone’s life is at stake (Shriv-astava, 2021, 12:41–13:29). Rani, on the other hand, faces pressure from theboard committee members who want the issue to disappear. They see the entiresituation as a PR disaster and want Deepak’s position to be restored. It is clearthat the upper echelons of the bank do not consider Ayesha’s case a significantissue but merely a case of reputation. Initially, Rani tries to coax Ayesha toretract her case, even asking Ayesha to move on and threatening her job forspeaking up. Deepak’s wife, Nalini, also harasses and tries to silence her in thisepisode. Ultimately, however, in the final episode we see that Rani reckons withher own experience of sexual harassment and pressures she faced from her ownmentor when she shares her experience publicly at the end of the series. WhenDeepak’s crimes come to light, he is arrested and taken to the police station,where he is shown finding ways to reveal secrets about Rani’s past. LikeHighway,this web series too highlights the privilege that upper-class perpetrators have. Theprotection they receive from their families and peers makes it extremely difficultfor rape victim-survivors to fight for justice. However, unlike Uncle Shukla whosenarrative fades at the end of the film, we witness Deepak’s arrest before our eyes.In the final episode titled ‘A Room of One’s Own’ (the feminist filmmaker’snod to Virginia Woolf), the private space – which is usually where a woman’straumatic sexual experiences are silenced – transforms into a space where amother shares her experiences of sexual assault and rape with her step daughter.Once again, we see filmmaker’s refreshing approach to this salient issue. In thispivotal scene, Rani openly asks Shai to share it with her if boys at a party hadtouched her inappropriately. She then emphasises that her daughter must share itwith her if she ever faces such a situation (Shrivastava, 2021, 33:04–33:21). Then,we see a rare scene in which Rani opens up about her own sexual assault andexpresses her regret for not opening up and sharing this with anyone sooner dueto shame. Rani says,I had just joined JDR bank. I was relatively new in Bombay. Myboss – he expected me to spend time with him after work…andthen he started touching me. When it happened the first time, I wasreally confused. I was really scared but I thought maybe that’s justthe way it is. I wanted success at any cost. No matter what. So, Ikept shut. Just…But, then it didn’t stop. It just went on and on andon. My husband thought I was having an affair with him. I just lethim think that way. It was horrible, Shai. I can still feel his breathon my face. I can still feel him inside me. There is not a single daywhen that nightmare doesn’t come back to haunt me!(Shrivastava, 2021, 35:38–38:00)In this pivotal scene, we see a strong bond that develops between Rani andShai. This is also the first time that a filmmaker has shown a mother not silencing138 Nidhi Shrivastavaher daughter, but encouraging her to talk about an issue that is typicallyconsidered tabooed. In Highway, for example when Veera was facing herperpetrator, her mother had attempted to shush her. But here, the filmmakerdraws attention to the private space, showing that rape victim-survivors need tohave the support of family members and loved ones rather than face the traumaby themselves. Once again, unlike the typical rape-revenge devices that have beenused previously, here again the rape victim faces the society and her perpetrator.While the television web series focusses primarily on the narratives of elite andupper/middle class men and women, Lily’s narrative also deserves equal attention.Unlike the similar character in Highway – Mahabir’s mother, whose trauma isshared through her son, and who herself is never seen or heard throughout thefilm – Lily is assertive, ambitious, a business owner and strives for a better futurefor her and her son. However, throughout the web series, she meets with obstaclesthat prevent her moving up on the social ladder. When Ayesha finds comfort withLily after her traumatic experience, and says that they are both alike, Lily remindsher of a reality: ‘you have a choice… I don’t have the privilege. My destinyforbids it’ (Shrivastava, 2021, 26:53–27:18). Initially, Lily who is the sole witnessto Ayesha’s traumatic experience of sexual assault, agrees to testify against theperpetrator to protect Ayesha. However, she changes her mind when the companyoffers her a chance to open a business. When Ayesha confronts her, Lily explainsthat for her survival supersedes the notion of social justice. In the wake of the#MeToo movement, Bombay Begums starts a crucial conversation: who canspeak up against the perpetrators? Who is able to make themselves vulnerable?Who has access to resources and privilege to speak out? Whose story can berecognised in the public spheres?This show was also well-received by audiences. Shubra Gupta (2021) writes,for instance, that ‘Alankrita Shrivastava has been consistently pushing boundarieswith her portrayal of women’s sexuality…Flawed, real, hurting, laughing womenwho make you stay with them, and root for them’. V.S. Arvind (2021) calls theseries ‘a step in the right direction. Despite the flawed nature in which its story ispresented the series has its heart in the right place and its representation of womenis something new, even radical by Indian standards’. Ultimately, the show sug-gests that the rape victim-survivors – Ayesha, Lily and Rani – are complex andflawed characters. Because of this, the filmmaker shows that the big socialchanges necessary to subvert the structures that enable wide-spread sexual assaultto persevere in a society like India are not easy to produce because of therepercussions that the rape victim-survivors face. Sometimes, despite being vic-tims of sexual assault themselves, they are pressured into silencing others whomay have suffered as well, because of career and societal expectations.ConclusionAlthough there has been a noticeable shift in the way in which rapevictim-survivors are portrayed in both Hindi commercial films and television webseries, I do want to underscore that these visions by the filmmakers are equally aIndia – Rape and the Prevalent Culture of Silence 139desire for a change that these filmmakers want to see in the society and arguablyrepresent a utopic vision of what the outcome of the #MeToo movement wouldlook like if it worked in the favour of the rape victim-survivor. Yet, at the sametime, both Ali and Shrivastava should also be recognised for trying to start adialogue with their show and film. This is an important effort to break the cultureof silence (which continues to remain pertinent).We also see that the filmmakers are no longer constructing a one-dimensional,helpless, rape victim-survivor who is unable to take charge of her situation.Rather, the rape victim-survivors are complex, multi-faceted women who areasserting their choices – Veera confronts her rapists and shames him in front of hisentire family; Ayesha files charges against a man whom she considered hermentor; and Lily, who witnesses Ayesha’s sexual assault, chooses to speak upagainst the crime but retracts it later.Finally, both Highway and Bombay Begums represent the rapists/perpetratorsas upper/middle class men who are of privilege and usually shielded from thecrimes that they have committed. This is an important decision made by bothfilmmakers to go against the traditional representations of rapists as men whobelong to the lower class. Their cinematic and television representations shift theconversation away from the perpetrators who belong to lower class/caste in themainstream discourse, which continues to silence women who have been sexuallyassaulted and raped by upper-class men. To sum up, it is important to recognisethe power and value of these media texts and the resulting conversations theycreate.ReferencesAkhtar, Z., et al. (Producers). (2019). Made in heaven [Video].

This includes gender norms, which have longbeen based around the common stereotypes of men as breadwinners andwomen as housewives. Social liberalisation and economic change in the late20th century saw these patterns change as more women entered the work-force and, despite Japan’s dismal standing in global equality rankings, beganto make inroads into some positions of political and corporate leadership.Yet, the way in which women are treated by men is shaped not only byfemale gender norms but also by the social factors that determine malepatterns of behaviour. This chapter considers how Japan’s male gendernorms, particularly the focus on man as economic labourers rather thanactive members of the family unit, have damaged many men’s ability toconnect, on an emotional level, with the women in their lives. It looks at theissue of misogyny; what is known as the Lolita Complex; the growing trendof herbivore men; and the concept of Ikumen, men who are active within thefamily. While some of these patterns of behaviour can be harmful – forwomen on the individual level, and for Japan as a whole, on the social level –there are some trends which suggest that gender norms in Japan can bedirected in a manner which will allow for much healthier emotional rela-tionships to develop between the genders in a manner that will help build asociety that is more cognisant of and attentive to the needs of women.Gender Violence, the Law, and Society, 143–159Copyright © 2022 Gavan Patrick GrayPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

(Joyce, Paulson, &Powers, 1976, p. 4, Silva-Grodin, 2010). Despite this, during the later Tokugawaera (17th to 19th century), women’s roles were not purely servile and dependingupon social class, there were expectations that women would be well educated(Tocco, 2003, p. 194). It was during the Meiji era (1868–1912) that perhaps themost impactful gender norm came into existence, the concept of ryōsai kenbo, or‘good wife, wise mother’, which was an injunction to women to use their edu-cation for the development of their children in a socially productive manner(Koyama, 2013).During the early 20th century, this was explicitly taught to young women as astaple of education, even to the extent that they should see childbirth as a patrioticduty. This paradigm met resistance, however, from Japanese feminists and lib-erals who, by the 1980s, were making public calls for it to be replaced by greaterstandards of equality and increased female access to political and economic sys-tems (Uno, 1993). Nonetheless, the underlying belief in the wise mother raisingsocially productive children still has a powerful influence over deep-rooted gendernorms that affect men just as deeply as they do women. In particular, the notionthat the family is the woman’s domain, and that child-rearing is her responsibility,continues to support the equally rigid and outdated norm that the man’s role is asthe breadwinner and that work takes precedence over involvement in familyaffairs, whether marital or child-related.This male gender stereotype, the industrious and productive, yet distant,breadwinner, has been a staple since the 1950s and, though it is beginning toslowly change, has created an emotional crisis among many Japanese men thatdeeply affects the way they view and treat women. When considering Japanesesocial attitudes towards women, it is therefore vital to understand the normativeforces that shape men’s interactions with them. Rather than seeing Japanesesociety as a patriarchal structure that marginalises women, it is important torecognise that a great many men have serious emotional problems that manifestin a variety of ways. I should make it clear that this by no means describes the1This work was supported by a Kaken grant (18K13005) from the Japan Society for thePromotion of Science.144 Gavan Patrick Graymajority of Japanese men, very many of whom are emotionally well adjusted.However, the extreme cases are common enough to act as significant warningflags for underlying problems in the way many men relate to women. In somecases, this is inherently negative, where efforts to address emotional stress see menattempt to maintain a dominant role over subservient women (misogyny). Inothers it sees men fixate upon unthreatening juvenile women (lolicon or ‘lolitacomplex’). In some cases, the stress of relationships sees men reject romanticentanglement of any kind (sōshoku danshi). Others choose a, seemingly, healthierpath and attempt to reclaim a male role within the family dynamic by playing anactive part in child-rearing (ikumen). Each of these is a direct response toemotional needs among Japanese men that are all too often neglected and eachhas a major impact upon how such men view and treat the women they know andencounter. Some are significant enough that they have a far-reaching effect onJapanese culture, including the way in which the ‘ideal’ woman is portrayed andhow women, in general, are treated. Addressing gender equality in Japan, even ifnarrowly focused upon promoting the welfare of women, requires understandingthe forces behind these differing patterns of male behaviour and the positive andnegative impact they can have upon gender relations.Current Gender NormsThe late 19th-century industrialisation of the country failed to bring about anysignificant alteration in women’s economic or legal status. It was really only thedrafting of the post-WWII constitution that introduced a fundamental reorderingof gender structures (Ochiai, 1997). In the following decades, some claim thatthere had been a steady displacement of the samurai ideal of masculinity, replacedinstead by a feminine elevation of soft, cute imagery and a greater leaningtowards passivity (Yano, 2009, p. 684).There is no question, however, that men are still firmly in the driver’s seat inpolitical and economic terms. Recent laws have introduced guidelines for estab-lishing gender parity in political candidates but women still made up less than aquarter of those gaining seats in recent elections (Johnston, 2020), while in thecorporate world less than 8% of top executives are female (Kinouchi, 2021). Thereis a wide variety of factors that perpetuate these imbalances but Japan’s deeplyentrenched gender norms are one of the strongest. From expectations over lifepaths to the pervasive endurance of outdated idioms, such as Otoko wa dokyō,onna wa aikyō (men should be daring, women should be charming), they have anespecially strong power in collective cultures to reinforce conformity to estab-lished patterns.Yet, in comparison to the West, there has been far less hostile resistance tothese norms. In the 20th century, Japanese women did not typically view the roleof housewives as oppressive but rather as a separate and distinct source of powerover both the family and society (Schultz, Tufis, & Alwin, 2010, p. 188). Suchviews persist, and in many cases, it is women who have more traditional outlooksthan men. A 2012 government survey found that 50% of men believed it is betterJapanese Gender Norms and Their Impact 145for their wives to do all the housework, while among women 60% held the sameview. Similarly, while 75% of men said they expect husbands to be the mainbreadwinner, 80% of women held the same view. Asked whether women shouldcontinue to work after having children, 40% of men said they should not,compared to 55% of women. Of course, in some areas more patriarchal viewswere evident, such as 35% of men saying they feel housewives should follow theirdecisions, with only 20% of women agreeing (Cabinet Office, 2011, pp. 14–17).Even these brief questions highlight some persistent trends in gender issues inJapan; women want more freedom from male decision-making but they do notfeel this is necessarily connected to relinquishing established roles within thefamilial structure. What can we infer about men, though? The most dominanttheme is that they are expected, by both sexes, to act as breadwinners and to havea focus on work. A separate and more recent survey highlighted the key factoreven more clearly. When asked ‘What society expects from being a man?’, by farthe most popular response (68%) was ‘success at work and financial support fortheir family’. The next two most popular responses were ‘not to cry or becomeemotional’ (36%) and ‘to show leadership’ (29%). Among the least popularresponses were ‘to display empathy’ (5.5%) and ‘childcare’ (5.5%) (Asahi, 2020).There is no question that Japan has deep gender imbalances, but it is equally truethat the country’s gender norms place severe restrictions on the manner in whichmen are expected to develop emotionally, and limitations on the role they areexpected to play within the family structure.Emotional DevelopmentIt is understandable that cultural factors produce distinct patterns of emotionaldevelopment when comparing a more collective society, such as Japan, and amore individualistic one, such as the United States (Kitayama, Mesquito, &Karasawa, 2006). A common factor, though, is that girls are generally expected tobe more expressive and empathetic, while boys are expected to externalise theiremotions. In Japan, boys are specifically expected to either hide emotioncompletely or to express it through ‘displays of anger or disgust’ (Saeki,Watanabe, & Kido, 2015, p. 30).Traditionally, it was expected that these pressures would begin with the onsetof elementary school and it was only in the period before that when boys could beemotionally free. With the father’s role being highly career-focused, the child’semotional development was primarily tied to, and strongly influenced by, inter-actions with their mother who became the source of familial discipline (Benedict,1989, pp. 254, 263). Miyamoto (1994, p. 186) saw this as a source of emotionaldependency and reticence as well as the development of a skewed view of spousalrelationships that was typically devoid of displays of affection, romance orphysical attraction. For many men, this created an expectation that romanticpartners and marriage partners were distinct things and that the idealised form ofthe latter was a traditional, asexual, mother-figure.The notion of emotional dependency has taken a specific form in Japanthrough the concept of Amae, which Doi (1973, p. 167) defined as, ‘the craving of146 Gavan Patrick Graya newborn child for close contact with its mother and the desire to deny the act ofseparation that is an inevitable part of human existence’. The concept has sincebeen further studied and refined into distinct aspects and qualities that go beyondthe preceding simplification (Behrens & Kondo-Ikemure, 2011). One commonfactor, however, was that insecurely attached children are the most affected by it,i.e. that it can exacerbate patterns of emotional fragility (Komatsu, 2011, p. v).The problematic aspect of this occurs when men consider future partners throughthe sole lens of being a suitable mother, rather than the additional aspects ofeither a romantic lover or an emotional friend. Success in finding the former canoften result in deficits in other areas of their life that leave men with seriousunsatisfied needs that they will, due to their own normative expectations, bereluctant to express openly.The education system has done little to ease such problems, and in fact, is farmore likely to exacerbate them where they exist. The implicit message that sexualrelations within the family are purely a matter of procreation has generally beenreinforced by limited sexual education curricula that focus purely on biologicalmatters and disregard matters of emotion, sexuality or relationships (Hashimotoet al., 2017, pp. 391–395). Only recently have advocates begun to have somesuccess in introducing the importance of exploring the latter subjects (Kuwahara,2019), but it has already had a deep impact on the very nature of relationships foran extended period. Salamon (1974, p. 131) wrote that in Japan, apart from thecourting and honeymoon period, sex was separate from home life and that, as aresult, working men were alienated from their families and ill-equipped to interactwith the opposite sex. A large part of why the sex industry became so deeplyentrenched was that it provided both a sexual and emotional outlet for men. Inthe words of Allison (2009, p. 175): it allowed men, regardless of their station inlife, to have a sense of worth. There are significant questions, however, regardingwhether the worth derived from such sources is truly healthy for those involved.Jolivet (1997, pp. 66–69) considered this rigid demarcation of boundariessomething that risked men enduring an identity crisis when asked to take on rolesof ‘good father’ or ‘good husband’, roles regarding which they had not receivedany prior guidance. Both Doi (1973, p. 153) and Iwao (1993) commented on theabsence of men from family life, with the idea that Japan had, towards the end ofthe 20th century, become a ‘fatherless society’. There are strong signs, as we shallsee later, that efforts are being made to change this and to make men more activewithin the family structure. However, almost always the driving force behindthese changes, though done in the name of gender equity, is from the perspectiveof balancing the workload of the female partner, in other words, a strong focus onmale participation in childcare as an instance of burden-sharing. While this isworthwhile in its own right, it overlooks the, arguably, more significant aspect ofmale participation in the family unit, which is the healthy emotional growth,support and outlet that it provides.The Japanese government found that women are open to men being moreemotionally expressive, with 46% of women disagreeing that ‘men should not beweak’, compared to just 18% of men. Women were also far more likely to wantmen to express their private feelings although only 17% of men said that, ‘when IJapanese Gender Norms and Their Impact 147have a problem, I feel I can talk to someone about it’ (Cabinet Office, 2011,pp. 20–21). For all the restrictions that gender norms place upon Japanesewomen, these norms have also done considerable damage to men, particularly interms of how they express themselves or fail to do so: patterns of behaviour that,in turn, can have a strong impact on the women they interact with.MisogynyThere is no doubt that persistent strands of misogynistic behaviour are a problemwithin Japanese society. There are, however, significant differences of opinion asto both the extent and the root causes of the problem. One perspective, as putforth by Ueno (2019), is that men hold an imbalance of power in society becauseto become a man means ‘being accepted by men’ while becoming a woman alsorequires ‘being accepted by men’. This completely overlooks the fundamentalimportance of the key roles men can play, first as lover, then husband and finallyfather, and how much the acceptance of women means to so many men. Uenoalso highlights money and economic success as being the primary determinant ofa man’s self-image, and how men determine their ‘pecking order’. Once again, thisgrossly oversimplifies men and overlooks how important emotional bonds are totheir identity and sense of self.When we refer to misogyny we can look beyond simple hatred of women, tothe more narrowly defined desire to control the social roles that they play.Manne’s (2019, p. 33) definition is suitable, classifying it as ‘a system that operateswithin a patriarchal social order to police and enforce women’s subordination andto uphold male dominance’. Examples of this within Japan are boundless, with arecent one being the statements of Yoshiro Mori, former Chairman for the 2020Tokyo Olympics, berating women for being noisy and taking up too much time atmeetings with unnecessary comments (Asahi, 2021). Such pressure for ‘noisywomen’ to assume a docile and subservient position in society seeks conformitywith the traditional view of the housewife who will not contradict her husband’sopinions on matters outside of family affairs. If, as Allison stated, many Japanesemen use the sex industry as a substitute source of self-worth that they cannot findin their homes, it is understandable, though certainly not forgivable, that suchmen will feel challenged by women who threaten to undermine the self-worth theyderive from their traditional, career-focused roles.There is a pattern of behaviour that can occur within Japanese marriagesknown as katenai rikon (divorce within the household), wherein couples maintainthe marriage purely as a matter of social convenience despite having no mean-ingful interpersonal communication or relationship. In some cases, this will persistuntil retirement, after which a real divorce can occur when the wife realises she nolonger gains any financial benefit from the arrangement, something referred to asteinen rikon (retirement divorce) (Cherry, 2016, p. 19). Even during the marriage,the husband can lose control of his own finances with the term sen-en teishu (1,000yen husband) referring to men who sacrifice their paychecks to their wives’148 Gavan Patrick Graycontrol, receiving only a minuscule, and emasculating, stipend as pocket-moneyfor the month (Cherry, 2016, p. 96).It might be expected that these marital pressures would reveal themselves mostin misogynistic behaviour among the older generation, in other words, men whohave experienced many decades of gender-related, marital stress. However, sur-veys conducted on the question of ‘Does Japan need to take gender equality moreseriously?’ found that support among men generally increased with age (Dentsu,2021), with the lowest results being among those aged 30–39, typically the primeyears of establishing a family. Divorce rates in Japan have been steadilyincreasing over the past four decades and more than 30% of marriages are esti-mated to end in divorce (Alexy, 2010, p. 238). Given this, it is perhaps under-standable that those who are recently married are more concerned withtraditional norms regarding family structure and career roles that might seem tooffer a sense of greater stability.The contradictory outcome of this mindset, however, is that women are rele-gated to one of two broad stereotypes, either the pure ‘good girl’ who adheres tothe established rules, or the impure woman of ‘loose moral character’. While theformer is often envisioned as loving mother, dutiful housewife or pure daughter,the latter is often sexualised, though the division is far more about submissionthan it is about sex. For example, a subservient and docile junior employee, or aquietly attentive hostess might be seen in the former light due to behavingaccording to the rules of a ‘pure’, i.e. submissive, woman. Even if the interactioninvolves sex, it can be deemed traditionally acceptable if the woman accepts herallotted hierarchical status in the interaction. Meanwhile, an outspoken femaleco-worker or a sexually demanding woman might be seen as ‘impure’ or, as withthe aforementioned Mr Mori, ‘noisy’ due to their failure to acquiesce to maledominance or established, patriarchal norms.Though this mindset is far from all-pervasive, its influence can be seen in manyareas of Japanese society, especially where sex might be seen as falling out of malecontrol. One example would be the arrest, under obscenity laws, of artist MegumiIgarashi for producing artwork based on her genitalia (Abe, 2020). Meanwhile,sex toys based upon the genitalia of famous pornographic actresses are openlysold on major sites such as Amazon Japan.2 In a similar vein, a 2003 book saw acollaboration between Tsunku, the producer of several wildly popular girl’s idolgroups, and Ganari Takahashi, the founder of one of Japan’s major pornographylabels (Takahashi & Tsunku, 2003). The book focused on something the twoentrepreneurs had in common, namely the methods used to market and sell younggirls, though one focused on images of purity and the other of impurity.This dangerously unhealthy framework to try to confine women within is clear,and attempting to fit them into such limited moulds produces a warped anddehumanising view of women in general. This has frequently been highlightedusing the way some of the afore-mentioned idol groups treat their young recruits,2This can easily be verified by searching the site for the terms 女優 (actress) and 女ホール(the type of sex toy).Japanese Gender Norms and Their Impact 149with those failing to abide by their rigid facade of purity receiving treatmentverging on the abusive. This was perhaps most clearly seen in the cases of MahoYamaguchi, who was forced to apologise to fans after she had been attacked bytwo of them (Tanaka, 2019), and Minami Minegishi, who shaved her own head asan act of contrition after daring to spend time with a boyfriend (St. Michel, 2013).Yet, this treatment of young women as marketable objects is just one negativeelement of an industry that feeds off a separate male emotional problem: a fix-ation upon non-threatening and submissive, juvenile females, somethingcommonly known as ‘Lolita Complex’.Lolita ComplexJapan has long had a cultural attraction to things that are delicate and ephemeral.The concept of mono no aware refers to the sadness of passing things, idealised inthe annual cherry blossom viewings. From this came a fondness for things that arekawaii. Though translated to cute, it more broadly refers to things that are weakand in need of protection and can be applied to both inanimate and living things(Sato, 2009). The most notable element of this culture is perhaps the cartoonmascots that Japan embraces, cute characters like Rira Kuma, Hello Kitty andthe various Sumiko Gurashi. The most notorious, though, is the fixation on younggirls, whether of the animated or real kind.According to Professor Kimio Ito, of Kyoto University, men’s culture in Japanhad lost its focus in the 1970s. For them, life was the simple commitment to work.In contrast, women were embracing new freedoms and being catered to by a widevariety of media in which their lives were represented with bright vivid coloursand boundless opportunity. Young men began to fixate upon female characters asan alternative to relationships they were unable to develop in their own lives(Galbraith, 2017, p. 29). By the 1980s, this had developed into a wave of seishunor ‘youth’ entertainment; television shows and manga which focused on highschool life as an idealised time of emotional growth and meaningful relationships.The first idol group, precursors to the wildly popular AKB-48 and similar groups,took form in O-Nyanko Kurabu (Kitten Club), 11 teenage girls who dressed inschool uniforms and sang overly sexualised songs.3At the same time, fictional female characters, ‘magical girls’ such as SailorMoon, were becoming increasingly popular with male audiences. Both of thesetrends, the idols and the fictional characters were marketed on characteristics(purity, freedom, respect and a lack of threat) that would form the key appeal formen who embraced what came to be called Lolicon or Lolita Complex (Saito,2013, p. 158). Mari Kotani, a Japanese pop culture critic, suggests that there is nodifference between the idols and the cartoon characters as in either case the men arecommitting themselves to an idealised, utterly fictional creation (Galbraith, 2017,p. 35). The important factor in both cases, according to Yoshiko (1997, p. 183), is3With titles like: Don’t make me take off my sailor uniform, Better be good, teacher andUh-oh, a pervert!150 Gavan Patrick Graythat inexperienced men’s virginal fear of more mature women is alleviated by theimagery of undeveloped, unmotherly, innocent girls who represent no threat.Masahiro Morioka, a professor of ethics at the prestigious Tokyo University, freelyadmits to suffering from a Lolita Complex and links it specifically to having anemotional dependency on his mother, coupled with an inability to adjust to thesexual awakenings of puberty (Otake, 2017). For Morioka, his fixation on younggirls was very much a rejection of his own masculinity.This is something echoed by Maruta (2001, pp. 150–154), who claims thatthese adolescent girls represent an idealised form of kawaii as beauty. However,Maruta touches on the dark side of this attraction when he claims that sexualtransactions between young girls and older men, what is known as Enjo Kōsai(literally ‘social support’ but more accurately ‘compensated dating’), are notprostitution as it represents female equality with, or even dominance over, weakermen. This is certainly a problematic and superficial assessment, yet, it is notwrong in identifying the customers as men with serious emotional issues. In ananalysis of compensated dating in Hong Kong, Chu (2018, p. 77) found thatsimilar views were common among those who engaged in the activity. These weremen between 18 and 44 years, whom the girls referred to as ‘big brother’, and whoconsidered their activities as a form of relationship rather than prostitution. It istrue that such activities often include non-sexual services, such as having dinner,watching movies or visiting amusement parks – and sex, where it does occur,usually happens after other activities (Wakabayashi, 2003). It is the age of thegirls involved, however, rather than the specific activities, that make it exploitativeand dangerous, even where no sexual activity occurs. Teenagers who engage inthese activities very often come from families with internal dysfunctions, whetheremotional absence, a lack of parental care or excessive control (Lee, 2016). Inother words, they are children with a degree of emotional damage that leavesthem vulnerable to manipulation.At its height, in the late 1990s, an estimated 4% of both junior and senior highschool girls were involved in such activities (Kadokura, 2007). The numbers havesince declined due to government crackdowns and social pushback but it remainsan ongoing problem that stretches into other areas, whether pornography,animated sexual cartoons or what is known as chaku ero (erotic clothing): a formof sexually targeted film which involves young girls (some of kindergarten age)being recorded in non-sexual but provocative poses and skimpy clothing. Thefilms of younger girls are especially lucrative, making tens of thousands of dollars,and are nominally legal (Varley, 2017).This is just one of the loopholes that continue to exist following the nominaloutlawing of the possession of materials related to child sexual abuse in 2014.44The author agrees with the view that the term ‘child pornography’ is unsuitable in that itconflates something that is of arguable harm and of complete legality, with something thatis inarguably harmful and rightfully illegal. The question of whether Chaku Ero, as agrossly exploitative abuse of young children in a blatantly sexual manner, should also bemade illegal is not a question that currently seems to have a high priority for the Japanesegovernment.Japanese Gender Norms and Their Impact 151The problem is that for many with a more innocent/naive view of the world, suchimagery (when not grossly indecent) is purely a representation of kawaii and anysexual elements are largely unnoticed. Keiji Goto, a lawyer campaigning for childrights, believes that many in Japan think the objectification of young girls fallsinto a grey area and is not inherently problematic (AFP, 2018), once again a nodto the deep-rooted gender norms which portray women as being either icons ofpurity or impurity. Hiroki Fukui, a psychiatrist who has treated paedophiles, saysthat there is a very low level of awareness in Japan of the dangers posed by childsexual predators and too many are not even aware that there is a problem (AFP,2018). Morioka adds that a similar lack of awareness exists among the menthemselves and that they display a deep ‘lack of self-reflection on sexuality’, andthat, ‘if more heterosexual men talk about their own sexuality, it could prevent orcorrect further “lolicon-ification” of Japanese society’ (Otake, 2017). If, asMorioka claims, the underlying issue for many of these men is their inability tounderstand and come to terms with their own male sexuality, efforts to addresssuch issues will almost certainly apply just as much to the aforementionedmisogynistic individuals as to a group who have chosen to respond to problems ofcomplex gender dynamics by retreating entirely from the playing field.Sōshoku DanshiBirth rates in Japan have been declining for decades with each year bringing newrecord lows (Nikkei, 2020). At the same time, the average age of marriage, andthe number of those who never marry, has been increasing. In 2019, the marriagerate was less than half of what it was in 1970, while the average age of marriageincreased by 2.5 years and 2.8 years, for men and women respectively, over thepast 20 years (SBJ, 2020).Analysts have looked at a wide variety of factors that may have influencedthese patterns and from 2009 a relatively new term suddenly became widely usedin reference to the declining interest shown by young men in romantic relation-ships. Sōshoku-kei danshi (herbivore men or grass-eaters) was originally coined bythe writer Maki Fukuzawa but took several years to gain widespread use. Itreferred to the unthreatening character of young men who are shy around girls,passive in their interactions and, importantly, happy to remain in the friend zone.Japan has a fondness for systems of classification and as the term grew in usesimilar expressions arose for other types of men: nikushoku danshi (meat eaters)for men who aggressively pursue women, gyoshoku danshi (fish eaters) for menwho are attracted to women but more patient, kurīmu danshi (creamy) for menwho are soft and gentle but still masculine (Nicolae, 2014, p. 71). Only theoriginal, however, had a specific relation to changing patterns of masculinity thatthreatened to greatly exacerbate Japan’s long demographic decline.Social withdrawal is a particular aspect of Japanese culture that is most pro-nounced in the behaviour of the hikikomori (literally, those who pull inward),people who cut off all direct contact with others. Some think this may represent adistinct psychological disorder bound by elements of Japanese culture (Teo &152 Gavan Patrick GrayGaw, 2010), and it may be that sōshoku danshi are exhibiting a similar responseto social anxiety, albeit limited to the one area that gives them the most stress:sexual intimacy.Authors such as Kitamura (2011) posited a variety of potential influences onthis trend: pressure and stress surrounding the act of sex itself, the disparitybetween ‘real women’ and the idealised fantasies many young men had developed,a decline in communication skills due to modern lifestyles, and the burden ofwork leaving young people with little time or energy for romantic activity. Oneimportant factor, however, was not that all young men were shying away from sexbut, rather, that there was a growing polarisation between those who engaged insexual activity from a relatively young age and those who had no sexual expe-rience at all. Surveys carried out by the Japan Association for Sex Educationfound a strong trend among young people, from teens to university students, toincreasingly regard sex as something that was not pleasurable. The pattern wasmore pronounced among high school students and female college-age studentsand the authors contributed it largely to a breakdown in sexual communication.In other words, they noted an increasing difficulty, in part attributable to tech-nology, for young people to have meaningful interchanges of opinions on emotionand interpersonal relations (NSK, 2019).5Japan’s Finance Minister, Taro Aso, rightly came under fire when he com-mented regarding Japan’s declining population, ‘The problem is those who don’thave children’ (Mainichi, 2019). There are many perfectly legitimate reasons whypeople might not have children. The problem is not that they do not have them,but rather that other factors may be preventing many people who might benefitgreatly from romantic relationships – whether tied to childbirth or otherwise –from engaging in them.A 2015 survey on Marriage and Family Formation by the Japanese CabinetOffice found that the most common reason for people not wanting a relationshipwas that, ‘love is troublesome’ (Sankei, 2015). Thousands of years of humanexperience would suggest otherwise – with love, and a desire to be accepted forwho we are, whether by lovers, spouses or children – being one of the funda-mental drivers of the human condition.As Victor Hugo wrote in Les Miserables, ‘The supreme happiness of life is theconviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves – say rather, loved in spite ofourselves’. Tolstoy, who was profoundly influenced by the earlier work of Hugo,said much the same in his opus War and Peace, ‘Seize the moments of happiness,love and be loved! That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the onething we are interested in here’.In a similar vein, the Japanese author Arishima Takeo wrote, ‘Where there islove, let there be family. Where there is none, let no family exist. Only by allowingthis can men and women be freed from horrible lies’. Another well-known Jap-anese writer, Uchimura Kanzō, wrote of how ‘Love is taken without reserve. It5Kindle Edition, Chapter 1, Section 5.Japanese Gender Norms and Their Impact 153has no fear, it is the highest morality. In love there is no doubt, for love is thegreatest truth. Love has no bonds, it is true freedom’.That so many people in Japan would now regard the pursuit of love as‘troublesome’ suggests a growing divergence in understanding about what loveand relationships mean to young people and the possibility that they are poorlyeducated about the benefits that such things can offer. Thankfully, there areaspects of Japanese male gender norms that have adopted a more healthy andengaged attitude towards the importance of relationships. One of these is theconcept of ikumen.IkumenIkumen is a portmanteau of ikuji (child-rearing) and ikemen (handsome) andrefers to a type of man who is particularly attractive to women because they takean active role in raising children. The word was first used in 2010 and became partof an ongoing project by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare to promotegender equality by having men take on more responsibility for childcare.6 At theoutset of the Ikumen project the idea of playing an active part in childcare wasstill rare with 26% of men agreeing with the statement that, ‘a father’s work-centred life is a key to family happiness’, and the majority among those who didnot explicitly agree still adhering to social expectations in this regard (CabinetOffice, 2012, p. 16). In the intervening years, views have shifted only slightly with30% of men still believing that work should be prioritised over family and thatwomen should carry out housework and child-rearing. These views are, however,higher for men in their 50s and 60s and notably lower for those in their 20s and30s (Cabinet Office, 2021, p. 16).The project has continued and the government’s Gender Equality Bureauhighlights the wide variety of programmes set up throughout the country tosupport men in becoming more involved in child-rearing, whether by learning tocut their children’s hair, taking cooking lessons or practising first aid.7 However, a2019 survey by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation found that 45% offathers said they spent only 5 hours or less with their children each week, with13.5% saying they spent no time on child-rearing (Rengo, 2019, p. 6). When askedabout which should be more important, childcare or work, 19.1% said workshould come first, 14.1% said childcare should come first, while the majority(62.7%) said there should be a balance. Yet, when asked what came first in theiractual lives, 56.5% said they prioritise work and only 6.8% said they prioritisechildcare (Rengo, 2019, p. 9).6Homepage of the Japanese Government’s ‘Ikumen’ project at the Ministry of Health,Labour and Welfare, https://ikumen-project.mhlw.go.jp/.7Examples of suggested measures to promote participation of men in housework, at theJapanese Government’s Gender Equality Bureau, https://www.gender.go.jp/research/kenkyu/chiiki_h30.html.154 Gavan Patrick GrayThere is clearly still significant progress to be made in encouraging men to takea more active and direct role in family affairs but the ikumen project faces someproblems. One of these is that there has been a backlash against the male-centricfocus of ikumen, with some viewing it as setting female household labour up as anexpected inevitability, and male labour as something to be praised for its rarity(Asahi, 2019). Rather than helping erase rigid gender norms, some have arguedthat it may, in fact, reinforce them (Kayama, 2017), with one PR firm claimingthat terms such as ikumen are outdated language in their gender specificity(Kamitaki, 2021).An arguably more important criticism of the concept, however, is that it is veryclearly focused on the issue of division of household labour, far more than it is thequestion of men’s emotional roles within the family structure. The former iscertainly something that needs to be addressed and a gender-neutral approach tohousehold chores is a worthy but separate concern. The government’s own Iku-men page explains its purpose as being that if men embrace ikumen, ‘the way oflife of women as wives will change. The potential of children and the nature of thefamily will change dramatically. Society as a whole will also grow moreprosperous’.8 It does not mention the emotional needs of the men themselves andthe long pattern of distancing they have experienced from meaningful participa-tion in family relationships. In a review of outstanding weaknesses in the ikumenpolicy, the Director of the government’s Work Environment and Equality Bureaustated that ‘It is very important for men to actively raise children from theperspective of enhancing the child-rearing environment and continuing employ-ment for women’.9 In short, the key flaws were identified as the failure of moremen to take paternity leave from work and insufficient participation in childcare.Emotional health, in terms of helping men adjust their life priorities from careergoals to relationship goals, was not significantly addressed. Part of this is likely tobe that for the government, at least, ikumen is more an economic policy designedto encourage more women to join, or remain in, the workforce, rather than asincere effort to adjust men’s views on the importance of family bonds.In his own assessment of the importance of sharing household chores,Sechiyama (2014) finishes by stating ‘it is a blessing to be able to spend so muchtime with my children…the time I picked her up from nursery and she ran to mewith her hands in the air and hugged me…I believe that we live for those pricelessmemories’. This is the reality of what men themselves need from ikumen. Itshould be not only a means of supporting their family but also a means of familiesproviding emotional support and deeper meaning for men. There has to be achange in focus regarding men’s roles in relation to their families, where they areviewed as more than simply a labourer, whether this is in terms of householdchores or regarding a primary career. Just as burden-sharing is an important issuein terms of supporting the advancement of women, supporting the emotional8From the ‘About’ section of the Ikumen Project site, https://ikumen-project.mhlw.go.jp/project/about/.9Ikumen Project activity report for 2020, https://ikumen-project.mhlw.go.jp/project/activity/2020/.Japanese Gender Norms and Their Impact 155stability and well-being of men, is something that will provide benefit not only forthose men but also for their families and society as a whole.ConclusionIt is certainly true that the majority of men in Japan do not suffer from the issues(misogyny, lolita complexes, or rejection of relationships) that have beenmentioned here. There are also a great number of Japanese men who do enjoyemotionally rewarding and meaningful familial bonds. However, it is the outliercases and the aberrant behaviours that arise from them that highlight some deepproblems within Japan’s gender norms. Even men who do not exhibit extremebehaviour often suffer from emotional stress and distancing that affects how theyview and interact with women. On an institutional and societal level, such atti-tudes can have a pervasive effect, influencing problems such as the commodifi-cation of sex and gender-based violence.Schultz et al. (2010, p. 186) wrote that ‘the liberalisation of gender beliefs willoccur only insofar as the necessary social-institutional supports for the integrationof women into the workforce are available and there is a demand on the part ofwomen for a revolution in gender roles’. These changes cannot be restricted tohow society views women: for deep change to occur and longstanding problems tobe properly addressed, the way that men are viewed, and the way they in turnview women and families must also change.The ikumen project was a positive move in this direction but it remainshampered by its excessive focus on men’s family role being one of labour ratherthan one of love. There needs to be a greater focus on the importance ofemotional communication, the development of more interactive and mutuallyrespectful relationships between the genders, and frank and open discussion ofsexual health. Ideally, this would occur from a young age so that both men andwomen in Japan can develop with a deeper and more positive understanding of,and attitude to, the opposite sex. In addressing the difficulties faced by women insociety, it can be common to view men as being part of the problem. The reality isthat such problems harm men as much as they do women and by addressing them,we can help society as a whole establish more equitable gender norms.ReferencesAbe, S.

This legal protection has, however, notfully translated into a change in attitudes of members of society. Raising thetopic of gender being on a spectrum in an African context is bound to resultin controversy. Many African countries continue to criminalise same-sexrelationships. Therefore it can be understood that the notion of a same-sexdesire is seen to be un-African. A common view is that the spectrum ofgender identities is a Western import. This chapter focuses on how culturalnuances hinder South African Indian gay men from fully expressing them-selves within the South African Indian community. Non-acceptance of SouthAfrican gay men by the South African Indian community is often based onfactors such as religion, patriarchy, hetero-normativity and the idea ofsame-sex relationships being un-African. Theoretically, intersectionality isused to make sense of discrimination. Intersectionality also serves as a lensbecause it considers an individual has multiple identities based on race,culture, gender, social class, age and sexual orientation, which are derivedfrom power, history and social relations. Within this chapter, accounts fromresearch studies as well as e-zine articles will be used to demonstrate aspectsof the intersectionality theory.Keywords: South African Indian; LGBTQ1; microaggressions; inter-sectionality; religion; homosexualityGender Violence, the Law, and Society, 161–174Copyright © 2022 Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalPublished by Emerald Publishing Limited.

Usually, people are categorised by theircore identities, such as race and sex, and often these identities intersect. Within therealm of my research interests, which investigates the identity development andmicroaggression experiences of South African Indian gay men, I explore theintersectional influences that contribute to their experiences. Born in SouthAfrica, South African gay Indian men hold multiple identities: that of being SouthAfrican, being of Indian descent and self-identifying as gay. Research on inter-sectionality informs us that due to our multiple identities, our life experiencesdiverge, where ‘the simultaneous experiences of all the (different) identities resultin different meanings and experiences than what could be captured by consider-ation (of a single category alone)’ (Stirrat et al., 2008, p. 91).This chapter will attempt to integrate some aspects of the multiple identitiesthat South African Indian gay men hold, and how that leads to the micro-aggressions experienced by them. There will be a focus on the un-Africanness ofidentifying as LGBTQ1 in South Africa, patriarchy, collectivism and religion.These provide a unique examination of the lives of South African Indian peoplewho identify as LGBTQ1. It must be remembered that the political climate thatSouth African LGBTQ1 people live in, which was discussed in Chapter 6, is asmuch an intersectional influence as the other categories discussed in this chapter.The chapter will end with a discussion, which attempts to integrate the variousintersectional categories. This discussion will involve a snapshot of the themefrom a research study by the author of this chapter, Dayal (2021), focusing on‘Honour and Shame’, which will be used to practically demonstrate intersectionaldiscrimination.What Are the Types of Intersectionalities and How Do We MakeSense of Them Using an Intersectionality FrameworkThrough an intersectionality lens, identities such as race, class and gender are seento intersect with each other ‘together or simultaneously to get some sense of theways these spheres of inequality support each other to maintain the status quo’(Zerai, 2000, p. 185). People’s identities are therefore pluralistic and layered, withlinkages to history, social categorisation, social interactions and power relations.Through this interplay, people can be advantaged in one category, while simul-taneously being disadvantaged in another. Despite these definitions and attemptsto simplify the definition of intersectionality, we need to remember that inter-sectionality has definitional fluidity, as the intersections of our identities and thedefinition of our being are constantly evolving.Crenshaw (1991), who provided a foundational framework for intersection-ality, presents a threefold typology of intersectionality, namely structural, polit-ical and representational intersectionality. Structural intersectionality coversthose oppressions based on race, gender, class and other identities which comefrom state structures. An example of this is a police force which may not besuitably trained to assist LGBTQ1 people with their reports of hate crimes ordiscrimination and end up perpetuating the same experience that victims ask them162 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayalto address. Political intersectionality occurs when political movements seek justicefor certain groups of people – such as LGBTQ1 people or people from a certainrace group – thus reinforcing inequality by excluding the needs of certain othergroups. The final type, representational intersectionality, is visible when images ofa group distort the complexities of the group.The four main benefits of intersectionality are simultaneity, complexity, irre-ducibility and inclusivity (Carathathis, 2014). Many models exist that aim to addcategories of influence on a list, ranked from most important to least importantand these categories usually allow us to understand the various influences on one’sidentity. However, often these models are additive and simply add to each other,where some categories are privileged and some are disadvantaged. Categories areindividually explained; however, their combined impact often is not. Within theintersectionality framework, a monistic approach is taken where multiple iden-tities are seen to have unitary influences, where the different influences on identityare seen as all-encompassing, thus protecting against heteronormativity, elitismand power dynamics (Carastathis, 2014). In this way, intersectionality aims to beanti-categorical, emphasising that ‘social life is considered too irreducibly com-plex, overflowing with multiple and fluid determinations of both subjects andstructures, to make fixed categories anything but simplifying social fictions thatproduce inequalities in the process of producing differences’ (p. 1173). Identitiesare seen to be more fluid, and the intersectionality approach aims to remedy thechallenges faced by the monistic approaches which fail to capture simultaneousoppressions. This is of great value within all identity creation, and in SouthAfrica, the categories of race, class and gender intersect on a historical and cur-rent basis.Despite the theoretical victories of intersectionality theory, there are alsosome departures. Intersectionality theory has been criticised for being toovague, as the mechanism behind determining the multiple influences of identityis not clearly explained. For Ludvig (2006, p. 247), definitions of inter-sectionality are open to subjective bias. He asks: ‘[w]ho defines when, where,which and why particular differences are given recognition while others arenot?’. It is also seen as too flexible, and to contain an inherent focus on cate-gories, even as it claims a departure from them (Crenshaw, 2015). Despiteclaiming a desire to be anti-categorical, some researchers who use the inter-sectionality theory believe that there is merit in having categories, as it helps usto determine occurrences of sociocultural power and privilege present ininterlocking identities (Shields, 2008). These challenges make intersectionalitytheory difficult to use in research studies. The outcomes of research studiesusing intersectionality as a framework, then, are often seen to be moredescriptive than practical (Verloo, 2013).Microaggressions in South Africa 163Intersectionality of South African Indian LGBTQ1 Experiencesin South AfricaLGBTQ1 people of all races face challenges in South Africa – though histori-cally, White LGBTQ1 people tended to enjoy greater freedoms and protections(Gevisser, 1994). Especially South African Indian LGBTQ1 people have his-torically experienced intersectional challenges due to their race. These challengeswere tied to politics, access to resources, infrastructure, education and otherdisadvantages. Today, despite Constitutional freedoms, aspects of these oppres-sions still exist. They are often attributed to the multifaceted influences of culture,race, class, gender, patriarchy and socioeconomic status. Some of the intersec-tional influences on the lives of South African Indian LGBTQ1 people will bediscussed. Despite my reliance on identity categories, however, an effort will bemade to integrate categorical influences, in keeping to the suggestions derivedfrom the critiques of the intersectionality theory.Un-Africanness of Identifying as LGBTQ1 in South AfricaThe lived experiences of LGBTQ1 people of Indian descent in South Africaappear within the context of a racially and culturally pluralistic South Africa.Raising the topics of gender identity and sexual orientation diversity in SouthAfrica continues to be contentious within some communities. Within the Africancontext, same-sex desires are seen to be un-African, and these desires are labelledas a Western import (Msibi, 2011). It has been argued by some community leadersthat same-sex desires have never existed within the African context and that theseundesirable phenomena have been brought to the African continent through themovement of Western people, who brought their own cultures and identities(Msibi, 2011). Often, community leaders, who are mostly male, enforce dogmaticand patriarchal stances against LGBTQ1 people, promoting discrimination ofsame-sex relationships (Bennett & Reddy, 2015). This reminds us of the impactthat patriarchy and the influence of hegemonic masculinity may have inencouraging the discrimination of LGBTQ1 people. The notion that LGBTQ1identities are un-African creates an unsafe and challenging environment forLGBTQ1 people to navigate, as they find difficulties in openly expressing theirgender identities and sexual orientation (Msibi, 2011). South African LGBTQ1people of Indian descent are seen to navigate an identity within an Africancontext, and therefore the rhetoric surrounding the un-Africanness of same-sexrelationships creates an unsafe environment for them to develop this part of theiridentity in. The expressions of gender identity and sexual orientation are seen tointersect with a stifling community culture and a structural unsafeness related tosame-sex identity views.164 Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalHegemonic Masculinity and Patriarchy Within the South African IndianCommunityWithin different communities and in different cultures, there are differentunderstandings of and associations with the concept of masculinity. Within thestudy of masculinities, there exist the understanding that there’s a variety of typesof masculinities, which can be dominant in a specific context to varying degrees(Connell, 2005). The type of masculinity which is called ‘hegemonic’ is thedominant type in most contexts and is seen to subjugate both women anddiverging forms of masculinity. Often, gay men are perceived to be inferior bymen who take on hegemonic masculine traits. Gay men are perceived in stereo-typical ways which are often linked to effeminate traits. A gay man in Dave’s(2011) study reveals:You know I don’t like this very stereotypical gay scene. Thenegative aspects if you say you’re gay is that you’re immediatelyplaced in a box and that box is often you know very feminine guysand you know you see these guys everywhere… they carry littlehandbags around, um they have this squeaky voice and things likethat. I just feel if you say you’re gay then you get put into that box,which I don’t see it as something that’s positive because if I thinkyou gay you can still be yourself, you don’t need to feel gay andfeel feminine.(Dave, 2011, p. 23)Men who subscribe to the ideal of hegemonic masculinity often embrace ‘socialdominance orientations’, meaning they attempt to dominate other people. Gaymen are particularly vulnerable to this domination (Ratele & Suffla, 2010).Within the South African Indian community, the perpetrators of gender identityand sexual orientation-based microaggressions are usually male (Bonthuys &Erlank, 2012; Coopoosamy, 2018; Martin & Govender, 2013; Moonsammy,2009; Sheldon, 2016). Within the South African Indian communities, men havehistorically been the financial providers for their families and due to the powerassociated with money, the communities have been largely patriarchal (Carrim,2015; Patel, Govender, Paruk, & Ramgoon, 2006). This has made people who aredependent on these men for financial resources vulnerable, and these people areoften made to follow certain rules set out by the patriarchal societies, which maydisadvantage them.Due to the patriarchal nature of the South African Indian community, posi-tions of power held by men can be used to subjugate other men who they do notseem to approve of – often gay men. Connell summarises this as the subjection ofgay men to ‘political and cultural exclusions, cultural abuse, legal violence, streetviolence, economic discrimination and personal boycotts’ (2005, p. 78). Tradi-tional masculine values are believed to be learned in early childhood development,where attitudes such as status-seeking, antifemininity, heteronormativity, a focuson athleticism and the lack of emotional displays are taught as acceptedMicroaggressions in South Africa 165behaviours for Indian boys and men (Martin & Govender, 2013). There is alsodebate that the portrayal of men as being muscular and physically strong mayemanate from the representation of Indian men in Bollywood movies, which oftendisplay strong and dominant heroes and villains with muscular bodies andphysically dominant traits (Kaur, 2017; Martin & Govender, 2013). Youngerboys and men who behave in ways that are in opposition to these traditional waysof being are discriminated against (Dayal, 2021). South African Indian gay menare marginalised by the intersections of culture, patriarchy and traditional gendernorms. These South African gay Indian men feel threatened to express theirmasculinity in a way different than expected, as they fear being labelled and‘othered’ in a negative way.CollectivismCollectivism is a focus on the importance of the group over the individual andserves as an important identity marker of Indian communities (Triandas, 1995).Indian people often construct their identities based on familial and communalmarkers of belonging. Aspects such as community beliefs, community relation-ships and community daily norms and practices are a regular part of the lives ofIndian people. These practices are inherited and seen as a respectable part ofcommunity life. Interactions with family members and members of the commu-nity are seen as being of utmost importance and a key foundation to building astrong identity. In South Africa, the nuclearisation of Indian families was believedto be a product of Apartheid, under which systems Indian people in South Africawere moved to areas that involved high-density living (Khan, 2012). These areasproduced unique living circumstances for South African Indian people, as theyoften lived in small homes, within close proximity, and shared communalresources. This made community interactions easy, as neighbours would knowabout each other’s comings and goings due to the proximity in which people lived.A result was the collective responsibility that community members often took interms of shared households and resources.Some Indian people responded positively to collective living: many Indianpeople have found merit in living in communities where they feel supported (seee.g. Pillay, 2015). However, LGBTQ1 people who live within close proximity torelatives believe that collective living makes it difficult for them to fully expresstheir sexual orientations (Bonthuys & Erlank, 2012; Moonsammy, 2009). This isdue to the fact that many LGBTQ1 people feel that they have to constantly liveup to traditional norms and values, such as getting married, starting a family and,for men, being breadwinners. This made living a life that was different from thetraditional norm difficult (Moonsammy, 2009). The end of Apartheid signalled anopportunity for Indian people to move away from these restricted areas. SouthAfrican Indian people are now free to live in areas all across the country.However, the culture of collectivism remains. Some people find great joy in theseliving arrangements, whilst other people find limitations and challenges tocreating a true identity amidst a collective lifestyle. The impacts of politics, culture166 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayaland sexuality are seen to co-exist during the process of creating an identity that isnot always accepted and celebrated. Collective living may result in the policing ofconservative and community practices that are often unsupportive of same-sexrelationships.Religious PracticeAn important part of collectivism within Indian communities is the practice ofpraying together. Within South Africa, religion and prayer form an importantpart of the national identity. People find great comfort in praying and as a result,South Africa is rich in religions, places of prayer and community support systemsthat emerge from religious organisations. There is often a certain cultural identitythat emerges from each religious organisation, which comes with its own com-munity practices, ways of life and beliefs about the world.Whilst conflicts between religion and same-sex attractions have been welldocumented (Bonthuys & Erlank, 2012), some parents of children who identify asgay are known to seek solace in religion when making sense of their children’ssexual orientation (Livingston & Fourie, 2016). Despite the benefits that emergefrom religious affiliations, studies in South Africa have shown that some peoplewith strong religious beliefs were seen to discriminate against LGBTQ1 people ata higher rate than the national average (Mavhandu-Mudzusi & Ganga-Limando,2014; Mukwevho & Fhumulani, 2018). There are also some instances of repar-ative sexual orientation therapy in South Africa, in which gay men are subjectedto therapeutic practices aimed to change their sexual orientations (Van Zyl, Nel,& Govender, 2018). These men are made to believe that identifying as gay is a sin.The incompatibility of religion and LGBTQ1 identities within the Indiancommunity has been written about in many studies in both South Africa andother countries (Bhugra, 1997a, 1997b; Bonthuys & Erlank, 2012; Dave, 2011;Jaspal, 2012; Jaspal & Cinnirella, 2010; Minwalla, Rosser, Feldman, & Varga,2005). Religious practices within the South African Indian community mainlyemphasise the importance of religion as a vehicle of living a life that involvesfamily, marriage and procreation (Bonthuys & Erlank, 2012; Hassim, 2013).Marriage is commonly understood as being between a man and a woman, andLGBTQ1 people who have different thoughts about what signifies a marriage areseen as unnatural. The close ties of community to religion in South Africa make itdifficult for South African LGBTQ1 people of Indian descent to openly expresstheir sexual orientation out of fear of being discriminated against on the groundsof religion. South African Indian gay men often believe that religion is used as away to instil fear in them and that, often, religious texts are interpreted in waysthat disadvantage them. Religious dogmas that stigmatise LGBTQ1 people areoften expressed by conservative religious community leaders who display hege-monic masculine traits. However, some religious leaders openly accept same-sexrelationships. Some researchers have reported instances where the ‘communityhas been accepting of same-sex marriage, there is no fuss about it. Society doesnot frown on it either’ (Coopoosamy, 2018). These religious leaders provide a safeMicroaggressions in South Africa 167place for LGBTQ1 people to practice their religion in a non-threatening way.Despite challenges faced within religious communities, in a recent study, Dayal(2021) showed that South African Indian gay men still hold a strong connectionto religion, and they find benefits in prayer and religious practice. Coopoosamy(2018) recorded a similar sentiment in his study when quoting from an interviewwith an openly gay man in South Africa. This interviewee told him that religion isa powerful vehicle for him to make sense of the world and that:All these contradicting things confused me because even at thattime I knew I did not choose to be gay and why would suchcompassionate and a merciful God send me to hell forsomething that I did not choose?(Coopoosamy, 2018)Therefore, he firmly sees the good in religion and finds the interpretations ofreligion that oppress gay men as being unfair and confusing. Another SouthAfrican Indian gay man in Dave’s (2011) study shared these sentiments: ‘I don’tbelieve in a God that is um twisted or vengeful and I don’t think he’d make peoplethis way and want them to be another way for some unknown point’ (Dave, 2011,p. 25).The release that religion provides gay men was further revealed in a study onthe coming-out experiences of South African gay men and lesbian women (Nair,2020). In this study, a gay man expressed:I do hold my religion very dear to me it’s not something that Iwant to let go of. I was able to sit on my prayer mat again and I’llnever forget the very first conversation I had with God after manymany years was, ‘I’m so sorry but I’m gay’ that was the first thingthat I said and ‘you’re going to kill me and strike me dead now’syour time just strike me dead because I’ve had it I cannot keep thislie going on I need to talk to you I need you’. You know I brokedown in tears and from that point on I was like ok that felt good Iactually need to do more of these conversations and I startedpraying more often […].(Nair, 2020, p. 55)What is evident is that many South African gay Indian men believe thatidentifying as gay is a part of one’s being and one’s sexual orientation should belived out and not changed based on societal expectations. Some gay men aremade to feel ashamed about their sexual orientation due to societal views aboutthe incompatibility of identifying as LGBTQ1 and community values. Thisbalance between honour and shame is discussed next.168 Deepesh Nirmaldas DayalHonour and ShameThis section of the chapter focuses on a theme from the aforementioned study byDayal (2021), which focused on the microaggression experiences of South AfricanIndian gay men. One of the themes accounted for the major focus on honourwithin the South African Indian community and the emphasis on the shame thatemerges from supposed non-conforming behaviours from members of thecommunity.‘What Will People Say?’Honour and respect are strong notions that form the foundations of self-worthand status within Indian communities (Bhugra, 1997a, 1997b; Dave, 2011; Dayal,2021). Members of the family are often reminded that they need to be responsiblefor their actions as their actions are firmly tied to the honour of their families.There is a clear association with other collectivist cultures where members of theIndian community are expected to sacrifice aspects of individuality to pleasegroup beliefs (Dayal, 2021; Triandas, 1995). Within Dayal’s (2021) study, aparticipant mentioned that when he openly expressed his sexual orientation, hismother was more concerned about community messages than his feelings. Hereveals: ‘I am very close with my mother and it was particularly hard on her, youknow, and one of her biggest concerns was, “What were people going to say?”’(Dayal, 2021, p. 69). Families often discount the feelings and experiences ofindividuals, giving importance to the views of the community. There is often anembarrassment attached to men identifying as gay within the Indian community(Dave, 2011; Dayal, 2021). These messages are direct microinsults as they openlyexpress condemnation of gay men. However, there are also microinvalidations,where the lived experiences of gay men are being ignored, and their sense ofvulnerability is not supported.Another participant in Dayal’s (2021) study revealed an experience of tellinghis mother about being in an open same-sex relationship. She expressedcondemnation:I told my mother that I want to bring my boyfriend to a familyfunction. Only she knew that we were dating. She said that he[Participant’s boyfriend] was too effeminate. She was moreworried about other people’s opinions. I was so fed up of alwaysliving in this dark cloud of the community. It was always, ‘Whatwould people say, what would people think. You are supposed tohave a girlfriend, not this! This is not normal’. So silly! It reallyhurt.(Dayal, 2021, p. 70)These microinvalidations are linked to assumptions that identifying as gay isunnatural and being in a same-sex relationship is not normal. The participant inMicroaggressions in South Africa 169Dayal’s (2021) study is made to believe that what he is doing is not right and isagainst the natural order of society.Many South African Indian gay men and lesbian women have experiencednegative responses upon openly expressing their sexual orientation (Bonthuys &Erlank, 2012; Dave, 2011; Moonsammy, 2009). Studies in India and the UnitedKingdom have also confirmed these experiences of gay men being discriminatedagainst when expressing their sexual orientation (Bhugra, 1997a; Jaspal, 2012;Medora, 2007; Mimiaga et al., 2013; Træen, Martinussen, Vittersø, & Saini,2009). Studies in South Africa by Dave (2011) and Moonsammy (2009) revealedthat the message of non-acceptance of gay men and lesbian women within theSouth African Indian community is due to the idea that they are sexually deviant,and the open expression of sexual orientation will bring shame to the familyname. The underlying rejection is often tied to the religious beliefs and the col-lective culture that values marriage and procreation, which, according to mem-bers of the community, can only be achieved through heterosexual marriage and aheteronormative way of life.The fixation on what people will say is also rooted in the practice of gossip.The free flow of information between community members is said to be commonpractice within the South African Indian community (Dayal, 2021). Thereforethere is always a high degree of vigilance around what is being shared withcommunity members – out of fear that the messages will be perceived in anegative way, or the messages will be used to spread gossip about something thatwill potentially bring shame to the family. Due to this, many gay men and lesbianwomen of Indian descent compartmentalise their identities out of fear of beingridiculed or discriminated against. Gay men and lesbian women ‘tend to benarrowly portrayed [… they] are hidden groups within our small community thathave remained largely invisible’ (Pillay, 2017).The narrow focus on community over the lived experiences of LGBTQ1people within the South African Indian community results from intersections ofculture, religion, heteronormativity and societal expectations. What is evident isthat the community views and opinions are prioritised over the well-being ofLGBTQ1 people. These priorities are especially visible in the question mostfrequently asked of gay Indian individuals: ‘When are you getting married?’‘When Are You Getting Married?’Marriage is a very important part of life within the Indian community. FatimaMeer noted that ‘inwardly family ties and religion keep them [the Indian com-munity] firmly together’ (1999, p. 103), and marriages are a way to accomplishthis. Despite changes in the forms of relationships and the different concepts ofintimacy that are becoming increasingly common, Indian communities continueto place great importance on the traditional heteronormative institution of mar-riage (Hassim, 2013).The pressures to engage in heterosexual marriages were reported by manyparticipants in Dayal’s (2021) study. Participants who are openly gay frequently170 Deepesh Nirmaldas Dayalexpressed variations on this remark of one participant: ‘During my twenties, they[family members] forever went on about when am I going to get married’ (Dayal,2021, p. 73). It must be noted that these participants confirmed that the questionsthey received focused on the heterosexual idea of marriage. Heterosexual mar-riages are seen to be influential in ensuring the continuation of cultural practices(Jaspal, 2014). Marriage is understood as a means to bring families together andgay men often experience great pressure from their families to marry women – inorder for the family to keep family honour and maintain a certain image andstatus in society (Jaspal, 2012). There are also instances of people believing that ifa gay man marries a woman he will be ‘cured’ and that his sexual orientation willrevert to heterosexuality (Bonthuys & Erlank, 2012). There is a stigma associatedwith waiting too long to get married. Families who do not openly allow their gaysons to reveal their sexual orientation to the community fear that their ‘secret’ willbe revealed if their sons do not get married before a certain age.According to a participant in Dayal’s study, some family members wouldcuriously say: ‘It’s time you get married or else people are going to start wondering,they’re going to think something is wrong with you’ (Dayal, 2021, p. 74). Thismicroinsult from a family member made the participant feel inferior. There may becultural norms that dictate when one should get married; hence, the influence ofcultural norms, traditional beliefs, gender roles and norms and societal expectationsare at interplay in adding pressure on gay men to getting married.The preoccupation of family members with heteronormative marriages leadsgay men to conceal their same-sex relationships, out of fear of discrimination.One participant from Dayal’s (2021) study said:Every time I had to hear my family go on about my brother’sbeautiful wife, and how ‘you should get one too’, I wish I could tellmy family about my beautiful boyfriend, they know he exists, but Ican’t even talk about him. He had to remain hidden. I had to livethis alternate reality, hiding important parts of my identity, just tonot rock the boat.(Dayal, 2021, p. 84)The participant, who is an openly gay man, is in a comfortable relationshipwith another man. However, he feels hesitant to reveal this relationship to hisfamily. This is due to his family inadvertently rejecting his relationship withouthim. His family is focused on him getting married to a woman. As they are awarethat he is gay, the insinuation that he should get married to a woman is seen as amicroinsult, as his sexual orientation is not treated with respect. Consequently,conversations about his sexual orientation lead to insensitive responses from hisfamily members.ConclusionThe identity creation of LGBTQ1 people is marked by many intersectionalinfluences. These influences have been shown to have the potential toMicroaggressions in South Africa 171simultaneously disadvantage and advantage an individual. South African gayIndian men are believed to experience intersections of different parts of theiridentities, which make their individual and collective experiences unique. Theseintersections often lead to accounts of microaggression which negatively impactthe lives of these South African gay Indian men and other people with diverginggender or sexual orientations within the South African Indian community.Despite these challenges, several research studies highlight how many LGBTQ1people reflect on their experiences and attempt to make sense of the intersectionalinfluences that are present in their lives, in an attempt to gain freedoms withinthese structures. South African gay Indian men are seen to attempt to transcendsocietal shame, working towards a more whole sense of self.ReferencesBennett, J., & Reddy, V. (2015).

Susanne SchotanusLike the introduction, this conclusion will come in a different shape thanyou’re used to. Though in every conclusion there is the urge to tie everythingtogether with a neat little bow, I am reminded here of the recent awareness intrauma and conflict studies that sometimes what is needed is to ‘stay with theconflict’ (see, e.g. Mayer, 2009). As the authors have shown time and again,all types of gender-based violence are embedded in a complex web of influ-ences. Consequently, it won’t be possible for one book to resolve all thefactors that lead people to commit violence against others because of theirgender identities and expectations. To realise the utopia that so many thinkwe’ve already achieved – a world where violence is on the decline, whereeveryone has the freedom to develop their own identities and where peoplelive in collective harmony – will require us to untangle these webs, make thetaboo a topic of conversation and stay sensitive and respectful to cultural,subcultural and individual differences. Let’s face it: that’s quite a challenge.Still, it’s easy to become complacent. It is fantastic that we get to celebrate‘gay pride’ and ‘women’s day’. It’s amazing that we’re at a point where theequal rights of women and people with LGBTQ1 identities are secured in somany countries’ constitutions. These are no small victories. But what thethree authors in this volume have shown is that even though laws can bechanged in relatively short time spans, they do not automatically result in oreven reflect cultural shifts. Constitutional protection is no guarantee of anabsence of violence. Just because there might be laws against hate crimes andsexual assault does not mean that the legal system is designed to protectvictim-survivors of these crimes. Even if sex work is seen by many as anecessary element for a healthy and harmonious society, as it is in Japan,people who engage in this work can still experience institutional discrimi-nation and economic and symbolic violence. And though patriarchal societieshave been shown to assign men certain privileges that are denied women, theassociated gender norms can be as violent and damaging to men’s mentalwell-being as they are to those of people of other genders.Instances of gender-based violence take place every day. And though theconcrete milestones that we get to celebrate might be important steps for-wards, they are only steps on the very long road to the utopia I describedpreviously. We need to keep reaching for these milestones. Butsimultaneously it is necessary to look at these issues in the larger web they’reembedded in. It’s necessary to start untangling the plethora of factors thathave contributed to environments in which the types of gendered violence canmultiply, mutate and find new hosts and targets.It is with this aim in mind that the chapters in this book have exploredthose types of gender-based violence that are often excluded from the con-versation. This book, therefore, combines often-silenced narratives into anuanced snapshot of violence itself. Though the use of the term ‘snapshot’might seem odd here, especially considering the historical narratives pre-sented in some of the chapters, it’s rather deliberate. As I said: types ofviolence can mutate, they change. In the words of Judith Butler: violence‘renews itself in directions that exceed both deliberate intention and instru-mental schemes’ (Butler, 2020, p. 23). And as violence changes, so do ourunderstandings of the concept of violence itself. In this book, violence hasbeen shown to be dynamic and adaptable. It has the uncanny ability toidentify cracks in the systems we’ve thrown up to keep it out and worm itsway through – weakening the systems themselves. Whenever a newcommunication medium pops up, ways are found to enact violence throughit. Violence is changeable, and if we actually want a violence-free society, weneed to change our understanding of it as soon as it changes its face. Thisrequires vigilance, study and publications such as these: books that identifythe different ways in which violence takes place in our societies and thefactors that contribute to its prevalence and specific natures. We need to lookfor violence beyond the obvious places. To properly understand it, we need tostudy it in its diversity – by studying it within the different (national) contextsit exists in and in all the different shapes it can take.Though the authors have made a fantastic start with this project, bybringing cases from India, Japan and South Africa to the attention of theinternational research community; by bridging disciplinary boundaries andby expanding the definition of gender based violence as its often researched –there is only so much that can be done in any one book. In the introduction Ibriefly touched on the limited definition of gender that has been employed inthis book. In future studies I hope this gap can be redressed, by doing forgendered violence what this book has aimed to do for gendered violence. Thegeographical scope of this book comes with similar caveats: in our desire toproduce a comparative, cohesive work on the different forms genderedviolence can assume in different parts of the world – in addition to theobvious focus on only three of the world’s countries – most cases analysedhave also focused on experiences from only the largest urban centres of eachcountry. In future studies the scope can be broadened by not only activelyseeking contributions on countries that are largely absent from the interna-tional interdisciplinary debates but also by paying attention to similaritiesand differences between urban, suburban, rural and other geographicalcontexts. By expanding the conversation of gendered violence, through new176 Postscriptinterdisciplinary work, it is my hope that we might come to a better under-standing of the project ahead, to address the issues on all relevant levels andin all relevant arenas and, consequently, to make the world a safe place wherepeople of all genders can express themselves authentically without fear ofviolent retribution.ReferencesButler, J.

    "abstract": "The ebook edition of this title is Open Access, thanks to Knowledge Unlatched funding, and freely available to read online. Gender Violence, the Law, and Society analyses and explores the historical and cultural roots of issues of gender-based and sexual violence in Japan, India and South Africa. Using a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary methods, this edited collection highlights the intersection of marginalized gender and sexual identities – such as raped women, gay men and women who are victims of commodified violence – and marginalized geographic areas.Taking a structured and holistic approach, the chapters authors break down issues across three levels: violence, state, and society. By exploring case studies from the three selected geographical areas, both the roots and effects and related organization and belief systems are explored in their relations to the issues of sexual and gendered violence. The chapters expose and consider the complexities and nuances in each country in terms of their varying cultural practices, their religious and caste systems, and racial disparities, whilst exploring and expanding the understanding of the concept of violence itself. Gender Violence, the Law, and Society takes an important step towards synthesizing area-specific issues and knowledge into a more comprehensive and global body of knowledge on the apparently universal appearances of forms of sexual and gendered violence",
