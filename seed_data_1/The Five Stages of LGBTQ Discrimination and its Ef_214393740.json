Braunstein* Although the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Obergefell v. Hodges provided some indication of equality for members of the LBGTQ community, the sad truth is that discrimination against those who do not identify as “heterosexual” reaches far deeper than the right to marry. This discrimination is especially present with regards to biased treatment by law enforcement officers and a lack of accommodations or protections within the court and prison systems. In a nation that has seen various groups of people fight for and earn their equality over and over again, it is truly concerning that the LGBTQ community is still being punished simply for being different. This article delves deeper into some of the historical and present problems facing members of the LGBTQ community with specific regards to the unethical and discriminatory treatment within the criminal justice system. The article then suggests guidelines that should be put into place to ensure the equal treatment of LGBTQ citizens by law enforcement and to offer protections within the court and prison systems.

INTRODUCTION Decades after the start of the movement against lesbian, gay, transgendered, bisexual, and queer (“LGBTQ”) discrimination,1 LGBTQ citizens have finally earned a long-sought victory. In its recent decision on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-to-4 decision that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage.2 Although this was undoubtedly a huge win for the LGBTQ community, the question still remains: “how, if at all, will this decision affect the larger problems with LGTBQ discrimination?” As further explained below, the answer to this question may not be as apparent as the Obergefell decision suggests. Although seldom reported in the news, LGBTQ discrimination by police officers has been a significant problem for members of the LGBTQ community.3 This discrimination has been present for quite some time, perhaps most obviously when looking at the enactment and selective enforcement of certain laws, such as anti-sodomy laws and “crime against                                                                                                              1 Elizabeth A.

Texas,5 in reality, this decision has not had as far-reaching effects as would be expected.6 Further, the obscure wording of some statutes allows for selective enforcement. Some vaguely worded crimes can lead to unexpected arrests.7 The discrimination against LGBTQ persons does not stop with police officers, but also continues within the courts and in the prisons.8 Some of the most egregious examples of LGBT discrimination within the courts can come not only from the judge and jury, but from a person’s own attorney.9 Surveys have shown that, even in our progressive, modern era, some people will not trust others simply because of their sexuality.10 In the prison system, looking beyond the obvious problems associated with rape,11 prisoners who are perceived to be gay or gender non-conforming are punished for consensual sex with another inmate and even some non-sexual behavior.12 Being a transgendered inmate also poses the problems of a heightened risk of sexual assault and limited access to gender-affirming medical care.13 II. MASS INCARCERATION The United States is statistically a highly-incarcerated country.14 Specifically, with only five percent of the world’s population,                                                                                                              4 See e.g., Phil Willon, Chief Quits Over Gay Sex Sting, L.A.

However, as more fully discussed herein, collateral consequences of being involved with the legal system can often generate the most significant effects on a person’s life.21 Merely escaping incarceration hardly means that a person who has become targeted by, or otherwise involved in, the criminal justice system is not subject to other legal and social consequences as a result.22 This is equally, if not especially, true for non-heterosexual persons.23                                                                                                              15 Id. 16 See, e.g., Michelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (2010); Todd R.

THE FIVE STAGES OF LGBTQ DISCRIMINATION A. Stage 1: Denial - The Refusal to Recognize the Rights of LGBTQ Persons The Gay Rights Movement has been fighting for equality for decades.24 The modern movement is historically noted as beginning with the 1969 revolt against police harassment by gay and transgender citizens near the Stonewall Inn.25 This rebellion gave birth to a movement that would seek equal treatment for the largest group of people since the passage of the Thirteenth and Nineteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.26 Prior to 1961, every state in the U.S. had anti-sodomy laws.27 In 2003, however, with the decision in Lawrence v. Texas, it appeared that the LGBTQ community had finally had its first big win.28 In Lawrence, an anonymous call was placed to police regarding a weapons disturbance at an apartment building.29 When the police arrived, they entered the apartment and found Lawrence and another man having consensual homosexual sex.30 Lawrence and his partner were arrested and convicted for engaging in “deviate sexual intercourse,” which was defined as anal or oral sex between members of the same sex.31 This law was controversial even before the decision in Lawrence because it was clearly targeting the conduct of homosexuals. In fact, before Lawrence, the same statute had been declared unconstitutional on multiple occasions by the Texas Court of Appeals.32 In its 2003 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court                                                                                                              24 Elizabeth A.

App.—Austin 1992). 6 UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI RACE & SOCIAL JUSTICE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 7:1  ruled the Texas sodomy statute to be unconstitutional once and for all.33 Unfortunately, what looked to be a huge victory in the way of LGBTQ rights, did not have the far-reaching effects that members of the Gay Rights Movement had hoped for and discrimination in the form of legislation targeted at LGBTQ persons still exists.34 Once again, in 2015, members of the LGBTQ community received another long sought after victory in the form of a decision declaring the prohibition of same-sex marriage unconstitutional.35 Alas, despite progress being made in terms of non-discriminatory legislation, the issues associated with LGBTQ discrimination are still prevalent throughout our society. As we have seen with the movement for other purposes such as race equality and gender equality, the process of destigmatizing a group of oppressed people does not occur instantaneously with the repeal of less than friendly legislation.36 With regards to LGBTQ discrimination, the process can be expected to be equally slow-moving, if not more so. For instance, despite the ruling in Obergefell, a same-sex couple was refused a marriage license by a county clerk in Kentucky shortly after the Supreme Court’s decision.37 Most currently, issues have arisen from state enactment of laws which ban transgender individuals from using restrooms appropriate for the gender identities. One such law, enacted in North Carolina has been dubbed the “most anti-LGBT law in the U.S.”38 In response to such actions by the states, the President issued an order on May 13, 2016 directing public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms                                                                                                              33 Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 579. 34 In fact, twelve states still have anti-sodomy laws enacted. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. § 800.02 (2015). 35 Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015). 36 Even still today, decades after the enactment of the 13th and 19th amendments, there are still many instances of discrimination based on gender and race across the nation. 37 See Kentucky Clerk Still Won’t Issue Same-Sex Marriage Licenses, FOX NEWS (September 1, 2015), http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/01/will-clerk-issue-gay-marriage-licenses-after-court-ruling.html; but see Mariano Castillo and Kevin Conlon, Kim Davis Stands Ground, But Same-Sex Couple Get Marriage License, CNN (September 14, 2015), http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/14/politics/kim-davis-same-sex-marriage-kentucky/ (noting that the couple was ultimately permitted to marry). 38 See Judy Woodruff, How North Carolina Signed a Bill Dubbed the Most Anti-LGBT Law in the U.S., PUBLIC BROADCASTING SERVICE (March 24, 2016), http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/how-north-carolina-signed-a-bill-dubbed-the-most-anti-lgbt-law-in-the-u-s/; see also Tal Kopan and Eugene Scott, North Carolina Governor Signs Controversial Transgender Bill, CNN (March 24, 2016), http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/north-carolina-gender-bathrooms-bill/.

B. Stage 2: Anger - The Current State of LGBTQ Discrimination Throughout the Criminal Justice Process 1. Police Discrimination Aside from discriminatory legislation,41 discrimination of LGBTQ persons within the criminal justice system begins with interactions with the police. In everyday law enforcement, police frequently target LGBTQ persons for certain crimes, especially “vice” crimes, which include prostitution, lewd conduct, and indecent exposure. For these types of crimes, police and prosecutors retain a great deal of discretion in determining whether and when to arrest and prosecute. Due to the improper use of this discretion, LGBTQ sex workers, transgender women, and LGBTQ youth are particularly punished.42 Further, because                                                                                                              39 See Emanuella Grinberg, Feds Issue Guidance on Transgender Access to School Bathrooms, CNN (May 14, 2016), http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/transgender-bathrooms-obama-administration/. 40 See Moriah Balingit, Another 10 States Sue Obama Administration Over Bathroom Guidance for Transgender Students, WASH.

This is likely due to public disgust with the idea of being “queer.” See e.g., Carlos A. Ball, Privacy, Property, and Public Sex, 18 COLUM. J. GENDER & L. 1, 12–31 (2008); Bernard E.

Stat. § 798.02; see also Fla. Stat. § 796.07 (entitled “Prohibiting prostitution and related acts”). 44 QUEER (IN)JUSTICE, supra note 3, at 61 (describing how the term “walking while trans” is derivative of the more commonly used term “driving while black” and reflects the reality that transgender women often cannot walk down the street without being stopped, harassed, verbally, sexually, and physically abused, and arrested, regardless of what they are doing at the time). 45 Id. at 62 (noting how hailing a cab or carrying more than one condom makes it “an open and shut case”). 46 Id. at 77-78 (noting instances where a heterosexual defendant in the same situation would likely not have gone to court). 47 Complaint, Wagoner v.

In fact, in terms of violence against LGBTQ victims, law enforcement officers make up the third largest category of perpetrators.59 In a recent report focused on anti-LGBT violence, many respondents reported that they had experienced verbal abuse, physical abuse, and sexual violence perpetrated by police officers.60 Additionally, police officers accounted for twenty-three percent of all offenders who were unknown to the victim.61 This type of inadequate police response and misconduct includes examples of LGBTQ persons being humiliated,62                                                                                                              54 Id. at *6. 55 See Jordan Blair Woods, Don’t Tap, Don’t Stare, and Keep Your Hands to Yourself!

Discrimination in the Courts As mentioned above, one of the most obvious forms of LGBTQ discrimination within the court system is the selective prosecution of “vice” crimes. For example, despite the decision in Lawrence v. Texas, sodomy laws are still enforced all around the country.75 In fact, twelve states around the country—specifically, Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah—still have anti-sodomy laws,76 and these laws are still used to arrest LGBTQ persons to this day.77 Even though some of these laws are worded very vaguely,78 they can and are construed by the courts in a way that negatively affects LGBTQ persons.79 However, the fact that a victim may be gender non-conforming can also lead to sentencing bias in favor of non-LGBTQ offenders.80 Several studies have concluded that the majority of gay and lesbian defendants experienced courthouses as hostile and threatening                                                                                                              74 QUEER (IN)JUSTICE, supra note 3, at 130 (noting situations that include dispatchers and officers mocking and laughing at victims of crimes, refusing to take photographs of a victim’s injuries, telling victims that is it their fault that they were victimized because they were transgender); see also Kristina B.

Stat. § 800.02 (2015) (“A person who commits any unnatural and lascivious act with another person commits a misdemeanor of the second degree . . . .”).

State, 800 So.2d 350 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001) (finding that the defendant did not violate statute proscribing unnatural and lascivious acts by his masturbating in a vehicle while undercover police officer stood outside and watched because the statute required that the conduct occur “with another person” and the defendant performed the act by himself).

For example, one respondent to a California survey on LGBTQ people in courts stated that “jury members suggested that a witness was gay and therefore his testimony could not be trusted.”91 In another instance, a gay respondent stated that he “was discredited as a witness because they said [he] was probably ‘out at a club or something’ before [he] witnessed the accident.”92 In order to leverage this stigmatization in their favor, some litigants in civil cases, and their attorneys and witnesses, used disparaging remarks to turn the jury against their LGBTQ adversary.93 Perhaps most frightening, is discrimination by an LGBTQ defendant’s own attorney.94                                                                                                              87 See Mogul, supra note 86, at 485. 88 QUEER (IN)JUSTICE, supra note 3, at 89. 89 Id. at 77-78 The defendant received 3 months in jail in a women’s prison and was forced to register as a sex offender even though had he been anatomically a male the case would probably never had gone to court and, at worst, would have been prosecuted as a misdemeanor. 90 See Brower, supra note 8, at 168-69. 91 QUEER (IN)JUSTICE, supra note 3, at 75. 92 Id. 93 See, e.g., NEW JERSEY SUPREME COURT, FINAL REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION Issues 26, 29, 40-41 (2001), www.judiciary.state.nj.us/task-force/index.htm (noting that 79 percent of gay and lesbian respondents reported observing offensive gestures, disparaging remarks, or offensive jokes, 45 percent of gay and lesbian respondents said they observed litigants or witnesses being treated disadvantageously because they were perceived to be gay or lesbian.

Discrimination within Prisons Over the years, society has developed a stigmatization of prisons as “queer spaces” due to their nature of being sex-segregated facilities, where the only options for sexual expression are necessarily homosexual in nature.101 This view is not new,102 nor is it necessarily unsupported.103 While there are undoubtedly examples of consensual homosexual encounters within prisons, discrimination becomes apparent when looking at the cases of nonconsensual sexual activity. Take, for example, the well-publicized case of Roderick Johnson.104 Johnson was an African American gay male who was sentenced to eighteen months in prison for possession of cocaine while on probation for a non-violent burglary.105 Johnson was initially placed in “safekeeping”106 housing due to his effeminate manner and sexual orientation, but was eventually placed in general population.107 Not long after Johnson entered the prison, a gang claimed ownership over him and Johnson was beaten and raped frequently.108 During the time this was happening, Johnson continued to seek help from guards, asked for medical treatment, and even filed numerous “life endangerment forms.”109 Many times Johnson sought help, he would receive responses that suggested that Johnson should not mind the abuse                                                                                                              101 QUEER (IN)JUSTICE, supra note 3, at 95. 102 See Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig, Why Americans Don’t Care About Prison Rape, THE NATION (Mar. 2, 2015), https://www.thenation.com/article/why-americans-dont-care-about-prison-rape/ (noting that pop culture, such as movies, advances society’s understanding that, when people go to prison, they get raped). 103 See Emily Albrink Hartigan, Just Talking with the Furniture, 13 J.

Although prison rape rates are notoriously difficult to determine,112 a 2011-12 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the inmates with the highest rates of sexual victimization are those who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or other.113 Due—likely in large part—to the negative stigma of appearing weak in prison and the threat of retaliation by inmates committing the sexual assaults, male victims of prison rape often choose not to report their victimization to prison authorities or counselors.114  Because of this, victims of prison rape rarely have access to safe spaces. Even when a prison attempts to provide a safe space for LGBTQ sexual assault victims, the results are less than ideal. For instance, the Los Angeles County Jail has set up a system to segregate gay and transgender inmates, which it claims is to protect them from sexual assault, known as the “K6G unit.”115                                                                                                              110 See id.

Id. at 514. Despite the plethora of evidence Johnson presented concerning the rapes, a Texas jury ruled in favor of the prison officials and Johnson’s claims were dismissed. See Johnson v. Doe, 2013 WL 3816727, at *1 (S.D. Tex. July 22, 2013). This case was a second § 1983 claim by Johnson after being incarcerated and sexually assaulted again. This second case was also dismissed with prejudice by the Southern District of Texas upon the defendants’ motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit affirmed in a per curiam decision. See Johnson v. Doe, 582 Fed.Appx. 512 (5th Cir. 2014). 112 See, e.g., Helen M. Eigenberg, The National Crime Survey and Rape: The Case of the Missing Question, 7 JUST. Q. 655 (1990). 113 See ALLEN J.

The results of the survey show that non-heterosexual males are at least 10 times more likely to be subject to sexual victimization than their heterosexual counterpart. Additionally, the survey shows that non-heterosexual victims are at least twice as likely to be subjected to sexual victimization by prison staff members.

REV. 1309, 1320 (2011). 2017] FIVE STAGES OF LGBTQ DISCRIMINATION 17  Although the institution of the K6G unit has been celebrated, the operational realities of it can sometimes defeat its purpose.116 First, the jail conducts a “screening process” where they ask the inmate about his sexual orientation.117 If the inmate does not “come out as gay” to the officer conducting the screening, they are automatically ineligible for K6G.118 This can pose a problem because the screening often occurs in a public area where fellow inmates are able to hear the inmate’s response.119 Not only is there a fear of what other inmates might do or say, but there have also been instances of verbal harassment by jail officials.120 If an inmate identifies as gay despite this, he is then subject to intense questioning by straight, white prison officials about his “gay lifestyle.”121 These questions typically involve gay culture, gay terminology, and “coming out experiences.”122 For example, the officers may “ask the inmates to describe the annual gay pride parade that takes place in West Hollywood,” may ask them to “[d]efine ‘glory hole,’ or ask how their parents reacted when they ‘came out.’”123 If the officers are satisfied with the inmate’s answers, they will ask the inmate to provide what are effectively “gay references”—people who can vouch for the inmate being gay.124 Further problems arise when it comes to transgender inmates because they are often assigned based solely on their outward physical appearance.125 The jail officials often look for things such as “breast development or other overly feminine markers” to determine if they are subjectively transgender.126 Additionally, bisexual inmates are also excluded from K6G housing sometimes based solely on the officials’ “intuition.”127 The institution of such a screening process is inherently discriminatory in the way that it characterizes certain people simply by their outward                                                                                                              116 Id. 117 Id. at 1322. The author references the fact that an inmate who is non-heterosexual may not be likely to volunteer that information in fear of repercussions. The author further notes that this can lead to confusion among transgender inmates because the question posed asks only about sexuality and not gender identity. Accordingly, the lack of context as to why the jail is inquiring can lead to inmates who should rightfully be in the K6G unit, being sent to general population instead. 118 Id. at 1322-23. 119 Id. at 1323. 120 Id. 121 Id. at 1324-25. 122 Id. at 1325. 123 Id. at 1326. 124 Id. at 1327. 125 Id.

This process, based solely on a set of potentially irrelevant questions designed by straight, white prison officials, does little more than test if the inmate’s expression of their chosen sexuality conforms with the officials’ preconceived notions of where a gay person should go, what they should do, and how they should be. The above does not even come close to being an exhaustive list of the different ways in which LGBTQ persons are discriminated against within the prison system. For example, there are cases where transgender women are deprived of basic necessities such as bras, which are necessary for some of these women for obvious reasons.128 In addition, although some inmates can have “gender identity disorder,”129 which is commonly treated with hormone therapy, inmates requiring such treatment can be denied adequate healthcare by prison officers seeking either to punish those inmates or due to a lack of understanding of what a gender nonconforming person is.130 Further, while in prison, LGBTQ inmates are not just subject to the high risk of rape, as noted above, but can also be punished for engaging in consensual homosexual activities.131 Although Congress has taken some efforts to reduce some of the issues plaguing LGBTQ prisoners, such as the enactment of the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (“PREA”),132 efforts have not been taken to address the overarching issue which stems from a misunderstanding of LGBTQ persons. So long as society remains—sometimes willfully—ignorant of this group of members of our society, no amount of training or enactment of legislation will serve its intended purpose.                                                                                                              128 See, e.g., Tali Woodword, Life in Hell: In California Prisons an Unconventional Gender Identity Can Be Like an Added Sentence, SAN FRANCISCO BAY GUARDIAN (Mar. 21, 2006). 129 Gender identity disorder requires a diagnosis by a licensed physician.

Stage 3: Depression - The Effects of Discrimination on the LGBTQ Community Discrimination of LGBTQ persons can have lasting effects. This is evident on both local and nationwide bases. For individuals, discrimination can take the form of bullying, which can, in turn, result in bullying-induced suicides.133 Recent studies have shown that LGBTQ youth are more likely to be victims of violence compared to their heterosexual peers.134 Such bullying is not always violent in nature, but can also take the form of teasing or harassment.135 While verbal harassment may not seem as bad as physical violence on its face, it is still one of the many factors that contribute to bullying-induced suicides of LGBTQ persons. This epidemic of bullying leads to LGBTQ students being more than twice as likely to commit or attempt to commit suicide than their heterosexual counterparts.136 As analyzed above, bullying does not merely come from the public but from the criminal justice system itself. “[S]tate sponsored violence is seldom named and prosecuted as criminal, though it may involve killing large numbers of people, torture, massive theft, and use of sexual violence.”137 The types of discriminatory police practices in arrests and prosecutions are themselves a form of violence against LGBTQ people.138 Despite the notion that LGBTQ discrimination has diminished since the                                                                                                              133 It is worth noting that accounts of white victims of LGBTQ bullying are often more highly publicized than that of minority LGBTQ victims. Compare, for example, the amount of attention paid to the suicides of Tyler Clementi and Carl Walker-Hoover. See Richard Pérez-Peña & Nate Schweber, Roommate Is Arraigned in Rutgers Suicide Case, N.Y.

For example, the continued existence and utilization of certain statutes to police LGBTQ-related activities, such as homosexual sex, can be tragic for those targeted. When recounts of people arrested for engaging in homosexual activity become public, the resulting public shaming can lead to suicide. Take, for example, the story of a high school student, Marcus Wayman.140 Marcus was sitting in a vehicle with another male and drinking when the two were approached by the police.141 During questioning, the boys were told to empty their pockets, and the officers discovered that the young men had condoms on them.142 The officers concluded, perhaps erroneously, that they boys were going to engage in sexual intercourse.143 The boys were arrested for underage drinking and brought to the police station for further questioning. While there, the police lectured the boys on the biblical prohibition against homosexuality and threatened to inform Marcus’ grandfather that Marcus was gay.144 After hearing this threat, Marcus told his friend that he was going to kill himself.145 Unfortunately, later that night, Marcus did just that and took his own life.146 The very real possibility of being “outed,” as exemplified in the case of Marcus Wayman, can result in LGBTQ defendants being too afraid of media exposure to even present a defense on their behalf.147 Because of this, it has been noted by one activist that: Officers are often able to act, secure in the knowledge that their behavior will not be investigated thoroughly or indeed at all . . . .M]any individuals charged under morals regulations may not challenge an                                                                                                              139 See, e.g., David Alan Sklansky, “One Train May Hide Another”: Katz, Stonewall, and the Secret Subtext of Criminal Procedure, 41 U.C.

Furthermore, many of those arrested are unable to afford the costs of mounting a defense. This exacerbates the climate of impunity. As a result, individuals may be wrongfully convicted of a criminal offense, carrying potentially significant consequences.148 Among these potential consequences is the possibility of becoming labeled as a sex-offender.149 A person can be forced to register as a sex-offender for “such minor and victimless crimes as consensual adult sodomy and gay solicitation.”150 This label alone can have dire social, economic, and physical consequences on an individual, and can become a sort of “self-fulfilling prophecy” that contributes to the vicious cycle of anti-LGBTQ policing and incarceration.151 D. Stage 4: Acceptance - A Beacon of Hope Despite the continued discrimination of LGBTQ persons within the criminal justice system and within society as described above, there have been some changes to our legal system throughout the past few decades—and especially recently—that seem to show progress in the way of substantive rights for LGBTQ persons and the beginning notions of equality. For example, the decision in Lawrence v. Texas, despite its caveats, was undeniably a win for the LGBTQ community.152 Since Lawrence, both the courts and the legislature has taken additional steps to move towards the preservation and protection of LGBTQ rights. Such actions include the enactment of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crime Prevention Act of 2009 (“Hate Crime Prevention Act”)153 and the aforementioned recent Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges154 finding a constitutional right to marry for LGBTQ persons. Even these positive steps are not immune to pitfalls and prejudice, and we as a society still have a long way to go to achieve a more inclusive                                                                                                              148 Id. at 41. It is also noted, however, that some jurisdictions are taking steps to prevent the media from being alerted from when such arrests are being made. 149 See, e.g., Robert L. Jacobson, “Megan’s Laws” Reinforcing Old Patterns of Anti-Gay Police Harassment, 87 GEO. L.J. 2431 (1999) (noting that the sex offender registry “was created in large part as a tool to harass gay men”). 150 Id. at 2432. 151 See Carla Schultz, The Stigmatization of Individuals Convicted of Sex Offenses: Labeling Theory and the Sex Offender Registry, 2 THEMIS: RESEARCH J.

For example, although the Gay Rights movement is intended to promote equality and empower all LGBTQ members of society, the movement has historically tended to focus its attention on the rights of homosexual white males.155 Some scholars have argued that this is because it is more understandable for the heterosexual public to understand and empathize with the members of the LGBTQ community who look most similar to themselves.156 Further, the focus on heterosexual white males is not just a tactic used to get a favorable response from the public, but some LGBTQ rights-related organizations and activists tend to focus their political agendas on obtaining rights specifically tailored to white and upper-class LGBTQ persons.157 This bias is exacerbated through media coverage focusing its attention on the woes of homosexual white males,158 despite the fact that the people most often targeted for discrimination are ethnic minorities.159 In terms of legislation, the Hate Crime Prevention Act was enacted, in part, in response to the beating of a young homosexual teenager, Matthew                                                                                                              155 See QUEER (IN)JUSTICE, supra note 3, at xvii (“[LGBTQ rights groups] have been dominated by white, middle-class leadership and membership, and have also relied heavily on financial support of affluent, white gays.

E. Stage 5: Bargaining - Recommendations 1. Revise and/or Clarify Current Anti-Discrimination Legislation As noted above, the Hate Crime Prevention Act has never been applied to the conduct of an on-duty police officer. However, even theoretical application of the Hate Crime Prevention Act to the actions of on-duty law enforcement personnel poses unique issues. One such issue arises in the use of the phrase “because of” in the statute.166 Circuit courts are currently                                                                                                              160 See David Jackson, Obama signs hate-crime law rooted in crimes of 1998, USA TODAY (Oct. 28, 2009), http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/10/620000629/1#.WFdnH_krK00, 161 See 18 U.S.C. § 245, the hate crime legislation enacted at the time Matthew Shepard was beaten and killed. 162 Compare 18 U.S.C. § 245 with 18 U.S.C. § 249. 163 See H.R. Rep. No. 86, Pt. 1, 111th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (2009). 164 For a more detailed discussion of the pitfalls associated with the current language of the Hate Crime Prevention Act, see infra Section III.E. 165 See, e.g., Kristine E. Newhall & Erin E. Buzuvis, (e)Racing Jennifer Harris: Sexuality and Race, Law and Discourse in Harris v. Portland, 32 J. SPORT & SOC. ISSUES 345 (2008) (describing how both homophobia and racism played a role in discrimination against a Penn State basketball player). 166 See 18 U.S.C. § 249. 24 UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI RACE & SOCIAL JUSTICE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 7:1  split on whether the phrase “because of” in the Hate Crime Prevention Act should be interpreted as a “but-for” test or a “substantial motivating factor” test.167 If the phrase “because of” in the Hate Crime Prevention Act is interpreted to mean a “but-for” test, it could arguably never be applied to an on-duty police officer, whose duty to “protect and serve” would almost always be a partial motivation for their actions.168 Although this issue has not been decided by the Supreme Court in the context of the Hate Crime Prevention Act, it is still troubling because “but-for” was found by the Supreme Court to be the proper interpretation of “because of” in several other federal statutes.169 If the Supreme Court continues to interpret “because of” to mean “but-for,” it is unlikely that the current hate crime legislation could ever be successfully applied to the actions of a police officer. In order to rectify this problem, the Hate Crime Prevention Act should be amended—or supplemented—with language that specifically makes it a crime for on-duty law enforcement officers to cause injury to another person motivated by that person’s gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. If such language were to be added to the federal statutes, officers would at least be on notice that such discriminatory conduct will not be tolerated and would likely put more thought into the potential consequences of their actions before they discriminate against LGBTQ persons or would refrain from such discriminatory conduct. On the state level, similar legislation can be enacted or modified to ensure that this discrimination is lessened nationwide. Over half of all states do not currently have legislation enacted which expressly bans                                                                                                              167 Compare United States v. Miller, 767 F.3d 585, 589 (6th Cir. 2014) (interpreting the “because of” to mean but-for causation), with United States v. Maybee, 687 F.3d 1026, 1029 (8th Cir. 2012) (holding that a “substantial motivating factor” interpretation of “because of” is more analogous with congressional intent). 168 It is worth noting that even under a lesser “substantial motivating factor” test, it may still prove difficult to apply the Hate Crime Prevention Act to the actions of an on-duty police officer, who may also argue that the “substantial motivating factor” in their actions is public safety. 169 See, e.g., United States v. Burrage, 134 S.Ct. 881 (2014) (finding a “but-for” interpretation appropriate in regards to drug crimes); University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 133 S.Ct. 2517 (2013) (finding a “but-for” interpretation appropriate in regards to a Title VII retaliation claim). The use of the phrase “because of” can be contrasted with the terms used in other statutes for parallel conduct, such as the phrase “motivated by.” See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 13981 (a part of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 defining “crime of violence motivated by gender” as “a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim’s gender”). 2017] FIVE STAGES OF LGBTQ DISCRIMINATION 25  discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.170 Further, the states with anti-sodomy or similar laws still in effect should repeal, or at least revise its statutory language to reduce the disparate use and effect these inherently discriminatory statutes have on the LGBTQ community.171 Even if federal protections are not enhanced, enacting statutes in the states that do not currently offer these protections could help provide for LGBTQ safety and equality across the nation. Such statutes could be written to be comprehensive, expressly including discriminatory conduct by law enforcement officers and members of the judiciary that result in the inequitable administration of justice. Prohibiting this conduct would provide similar notice as the Hate Crime Prevention Act recommendations above, and would likely reduce discrimination and harassment of LGBTQ persons. 2. Enhance Law Enforcement Training Thorough and consistent training of police officers, court officials, and prison personnel on sexual orientation and gender identity is essential in limiting the discriminatory and harassing conduct against LGBTQ persons. With adequate trainings in place, law enforcement would likely be able to better understand, tolerate, and respect members of the LGBTQ community. By making these trainings on diversity and tolerance mandatory and implementing them early on in the training process, the likelihood of police officers, prison guards, and others victimizing or failing to empathize with LGBTQ victims can be diminished. This type of training should occur every few years to best reflect the societal landscape as our acceptance and views evolve. Some police departments have already begun to successfully implement such trainings,172 but they should be implemented nationwide to ensure congruency and fair treatment of the LGBTQ community across the board.                                                                                                              170 Specifically, twenty-nine states do not ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and thirty-two states do not ban discrimination based on gender identity in state legislation.

Develop More Adequate Channels for Citizen Complaints As mentioned above, many LGBTQ victims are unlikely to file complaints against police for improper conduct and a recent study has shown that most of those who do actually file complaints can feel like their problems are not fully addressed.173 Out of over 2,000 respondents to this survey, approximately ten percent reported that they had filed a complaint regarding their treatment by the police within the five years prior to the survey.174 Of those who did file a complaint, almost three-quarters of them felt that their complaint was not fully or properly addressed.175 The authors of the report on this survey note that a “community-based complaint mechanism,” such as New York’s “Civilian Complaint Review Board,” could be beneficial to providing a safe environment for those who feel the need to make a complaint about police misconduct and to ensure that no retaliation will be sought against the complainants.176 Additionally, because these citizen complaint boards would be run by members of the community, and not the police force, the board would not need to report police officials, can hold officers to a higher standard, and demand accountability on behalf of the community. By having such a process run by other members of the community, and not by police departments themselves, LGBTQ victims of police discrimination and harassment are more likely to have their voices heard and their complaints fully addressed. Citizen complaint review boards could also be instrumental in connecting LGBTQ persons with the community in a meaningful way that allows for greater understanding of their problems and could result in more people becoming aware of and involved in the fight for LGBTQ equality. Several cities have instituted such review boards,177 but making this type of process available to LGBTQ victims of harassment across the country would better benefit the LGBTQ community.                                                                                                              173 See Protected and Served?, LAMBDA LEGAL, http://www.lambdalegal.org/protected-and-served/police (last visited Aug. 10, 2016). 174 See id.

Increase Data Collection on Discriminatory Police Practices As society becomes increasingly accepting of the LGBTQ community, naturally the information we will have at our disposal to view trends in discrimination will grow. However, in order for greater acceptance of the LGBTQ community to occur, it is equally important that their plight is understood. Because of the reluctance by LGBTQ victims to report the crimes and discrimination that they are victims of,178 it is currently difficult to obtain a complete picture of the scope and scale of the discrimination problem. While there are currently federal administrative agencies that conduct surveys on victims of crimes and on police interactions, these surveys do not always have questions that determine the sexual orientation or gender identity of the respondent.179 Even if the victims feel that they were discriminated against, unless directly asked about these categories in the demographics section of the surveys, they may be reluctant to volunteer the information in fear of subjecting themselves to further harassment and discrimination.180 By instituting policies and procedures to collect more information about the victims of targeting, harassment, and discrimination within the criminal justice system, we will be able to form a more complete picture about who the victims are, where such discriminatory practices may be concentrated, and what measures will best serve to limit the problems. 5. Implement and Enforce Internal Non-Discrimination Policies In addition to outside mechanisms such as citizen complaint review boards, both state and local governments should enact internal policies and procedures to combat and prevent LGBTQ discrimination and harassment by officers. By establishing their own policies and being able to self-govern, police forces may take the time to carefully consider how certain actions are perceived by the LGBTQ persons with whom they may interact. This in itself may work as a type of sensitivity training for the                                                                                                              178 For a more complete discussion on the underreporting problem, see supra Section III.B. 179 Some examples of these types of data-collection efforts are available from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, at http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dca (last visited Sept. 12, 2016). Relevant surveys may include, without limitation, the National Crime Victimization Survey, National Former Prisoner Survey, Police-Public Contact Survey, and Survey of Sexual Victimization. 180 The institution of citizen complaint review boards, as mentioned above, would be helpful in limiting many of these problems and would likely result in more complete and unbiased statistics on the discrimination and harassment of LGBTQ persons. 28 UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI RACE & SOCIAL JUSTICE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 7:1  officers who are tasked with determining the limits and penalties for different offending conduct by officers. Additionally, since the policies themselves will have been determined and established by law enforcement personnel, there is a better likelihood of the policies being understood and adhered to by fellow officers. Similarly to the other efforts already mentioned, several police departments have begun to make strides in this area and have enacted such policies.181 These internal policies govern a range of biased-based conduct including sanctions for profiling, discriminating, and harassing based on gender identity and sexual orientation, rules for interacting with members of the LGBTQ community, and how to ensure the safety of LGBTQ persons when booking them into jail.182 Further efforts in this area have also been made on the federal level through the enactment of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (“PREA”).183 The PREA not only defines what it means to be “transgender,” but offers specific guidelines for handling the searching of transgender inmates. For example, the PREA National Standards specifically prohibit “search[ing] or physically examin[ing] a transgender or intersex detainee for the sole purpose of determining the detainee’s genital status.”184 They further provide that “[t]he agency shall train law enforcement staff in how to conduct cross-gender pat-down searches, and the searches of transgender and intersex detainees, in a professional and respectful manner . . . .”185 By implementing the same type of LGBTQ-aware standards throughout both local and federal law enforcement departments and agencies, officer conduct can be better monitored and discriminatory actions can be punished appropriately. IV. CONCLUSION Research indicates that the LGBTQ community faces discrimination, harassment, and improper profiling through all stages of our criminal justice system. While there have been strides towards equality over the last                                                                                                              181 See, e.g., Amber White, LGBTQIA: Directive 152 and Ending Discrimination Against the Trans Community, PHILADELPHIA NEIGHBORHOODS (Apr. 28, 2014), https://philadelphianeighborhoods.com/2014/04/28/lgbtqia-directive-152-and-ending-discrimination-against-the-trans-community/; see also Boston Police Department Issues Special Order for Interacting with Transgender Individuals, BPDNEWS.COM (June 11, 2013), http://bpdnews.com/news/2013/6/11/boston-police-department-issues-special-order-for-interacting-with-transgender-individuals. 182 See, e.g., id. 183 42 U.S.C. § 15601, et seq. 184 See Prison Rape Elimination Act National Standards, 28 C.F.R § 115.115(d). 185 See id., at § 115.115(e). 2017] FIVE STAGES OF LGBTQ DISCRIMINATION 29  several decades, there are still many discriminatory laws in place as well as discriminatory practices occurring nationwide. The recommendations outlined above would help to solidify LGBTQ rights and prevent this inequitable administration of justice from continuing in the way it has. By removing—or even limiting—discriminatory practices based on sexual orientation or gender identity, LGBTQ persons would be better shielded from harassment. Such a shield could be a proverbial stepping stone that helps pave the way toward true equality. ",

    "abstract": "Although the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Obergefell v. Hodges provided some indication of equality for members of the LBGTQ community, the sad truth is that discrimination against those who do not identify as “heterosexual” reaches far deeper than the right to marry. This discrimination is especially present with regards to biased treatment by law enforcement officers and a lack of accommodations or protections within the court and prison systems. In a nation that has seen various groups of people fight for and earn their equality over and over again, it is truly concerning that the LGBTQ community is still being punished simply for being different. This article delves deeper into some of the historical and present problems facing members of the LGBTQ community with specific regards to the unethical and discriminatory treatment within the criminal justice system. The article then suggests guidelines that should be put into place to ensure the equal treatment of LGBTQ citizens by law enforcement and to offer protections within the court and prison systems",
