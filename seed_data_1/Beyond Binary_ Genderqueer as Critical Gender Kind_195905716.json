When youget rid of the binary, gender becomes a playground.”— Kate BornsteinWe want to know what gender is. But metaphysical approaches tothis question solely have focused on the binary gender kinds men andwomen. By overlooking those who identify outside of the binary–thegroup I call ‘genderqueer’–we are left without tools for understand-ing these new and quickly growing gender identifications. This meta-physical gap in turn creates a conceptual lacuna that contributes tosystematic misunderstanding of genderqueer persons. In this paper,I argue that to better understand genderqueer identities, we mustrecognize a new type of gender kind: critical gender kinds, or kindswhose members resist dominant gender ideology. After developinga model of critical gender kinds, I suggest that genderqueer is bestmodeled as one such kind. In particular, I propose that its mem-bers are united by resisting ‘the binary assumption’, or the prevalentassumption that they must comply with binary gender classification.1 IntroductionDissatisfaction with strict binary gender systems is nothing new.Nor is the cre-ation of language, modes of expression, and body modifications aimed at trans-gressing this binary. What is new, however, are widespread and legitimizedconversations surrounding this dissatisfaction.1 Just in the last ten years, websearches for ‘genderqueer’ and ‘nonbinary’ have grown by a magnitude of atleast ten times.2 Merriam-Webster’s dictionary added both terms, the Asso-ciated Press Stylebook embraces ‘they’ as a singular gender-neutral pronoun,and highly visible popular publications such as Teen Vogue and The New YorkTimes have run articles exploring the concept of identifying outside the gender1See, e.g., White et al (2018, 244) for empirical evidence supporting this claim.2Data source: Google Trends (www.google.com/trends).1binary.3 This is not to mention that multiple US states now offer nonbinarygender markers on government identification, with ever more municipalities andstates following suit.Despite this public attention, nonbinary gender kinds have been an af-terthought within philosophy of gender, and especially metaphysical discussionsof gender.4 The central phenomenon under consideration has been the binarygenders men and women.5 Narrowing the target phenomenon in this way hasgenerated two problems–one metaphysical and the other political.First, by overlooking nonbinary identities, existing metaphysical approachesto gender are insufficient for capturing persons who reject (exclusive) catego-rization as either men or women (see §3). This creates a gap of metaphysicalexplanation and understanding. For example, what is the relationship betweengender neutral language and being nonbinary? Or between androgyny and beingnonbinary? What (if anything) unifies the vast variety of nonbinary identifica-tions? Is there anything more to being nonbinary than calling oneself by anonbinary label? These questions are metaphysically significant, but the theo-ries on offer provide no answers.Second, without the resources for understanding nonbinary gender identities,we sustain a conceptual lacuna surrounding nonbinary persons. This lacunadoes not only reflect a gap in philosophical understanding: it contributes toa hermeneutical injustice that arises from the failure to spread and charitablyanalyze the concepts and practices underlying nonbinary classifications.6 In thewake of this conceptual silence, misunderstandings (both blatant and subtle)arise in droves – misunderstandings that undermine recognition and respect ofnonbinary persons.7These two problems can be ameliorated by an account of genderqueer aswhat I call a ‘critical gender kind’, or a kind whose members enact resistanceagainst dominant gender ideology.To be genderqueer, on my proposed model, isto manifest resistance to the binary assumption, or the assumption that theonly possible genders are the exclusive and exhaustive kinds men and women,3Merriam-Webster (2018), Sopelsa (2017), Papisova (2016), Greenberg (2017).4See, e.g., Haslanger (2000), Jenkins (2016), A´sta (2011), and Barnes (forthcoming). Evendiscussions of gender that purport to be trans inclusive typically overlook the experiencesand concepts underlying genderqueer identity.See, e.g., Bettcher (2009, 2013), Jenkins (2016),Brigg and George (manuscript), and McKitrick (2015). This is especially striking given that29% of respondents to the 2015 United States Transgender Survey self-identified as ‘gen-derqueer’. James, et al. (2016). Philosophy is not alone in this oversight. See Salamon (2010,95) for a similar criticism of Women’s Studies.5Though see Dembroff & Wodak (2018) as an exception.6Hermeneutical injustice, as defined in Fricker (2007, 1), occurs “when a gap in collectiveinterpretive resources puts someone at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to making senseof their social experiences.” More extended notions of hermeneutical injustice are explored inMedina (2012) and Appiah (1994), which include cases (such as white ignorance) when a gapin the collective interpretive resources regarding an oppressed group perpetuates the socialdisadvantage of that group. I take it that the lacuna at issue concerning nonbinary kindsmanifests in both ways.7Using Fraser’s (1998) account, this might be understood in terms of genderqueers’ accessto ‘participatory parity’, or the conditions needed to interact with others as peers in socialand political settings.2and to do so based on one’s self-perceived or claimed ontological position.8 Iunpack this proposal in §4.9My model has many implications, and no doubt will inspire as many worries.Like most philosophical theories, mine probably is wrong. But I believe it iscloser to the truth than analytic philosophers have come so far, if only becausewe have had little to say about nonbinary identifications. What’s more, it isclear that this theorizing is overdue: even empirical social research on trans iden-tities frequently lumps together trans binary and genderqueer persons, makingit difficult to use this data to explain why, for example, genderqueer personsoverall face heightened discrimination and psychological distress compared totrans binary persons, and also differ with respect to attitudes toward medicalinterventions such as hormone therapy.10 If I am right–or even close to it–thisheterogeneity should come as no surprise, since genderqueer conjoins personswho are extremely diverse with respect to such features.2 Terminology & Methodology‘Genderqueer’ was first coined in the 1990’s by trans activist Riki Wilchinsin an attempt to describe those who were both queer with respect to theirsexuality and “the kind of gendertrash society rejected” with respect to theirgender intelligibility in public spaces.11 Since then, use has shifted away frommere description and towards identity: in particular, it often functions as anumbrella term for a range of gender identities outside of the binary.12 I will usethe term in keeping with this recent shift, but my primary concern is not witharticulating “the true meaning of ‘genderqueer’ ”, but rather with articulatinga gender phenomenon that has been ignored in analytic philosophy.My analysis relies heavily on personal testimony from genderqueer persons.This is not only because there is a scant amount of academic research aboutgenderqueer persons, but also because I share the familiar feminist commit-ment to begin theorizing from the perspective of the marginalized. In what fol-lows, I distinguish between two kinds of personal testimony. The first concernsgenderqueer individuals’ intuitions about paradigm or uncontested examples ofgenderqueer persons, as well as their personal motivations for not identifying8I use the word ‘model’ very intentionally. Following Paul (2012), I endorse a method ofmetaphysics focused on building theoretical models for certain purposes, rather constructing(real) definitions.9I am not interested in settling debates about ‘what gender is’. I suspect this questionmust be split into many, more tractable questions. Insofar as my project is negative, it ismerely to show that the most common approaches to gender are inadequate for capturingnonbinary gender kinds.10See Rimes, et al., (2018), Galupo et al. (2018), 5, Bradford et a. (2018), 8, and Warrenet al. (2016). Following Heyes (2003), cf Stryker (1994), I use ‘trans’ to refer to the “multipleforms of sex and gender crossing and mixing that are taken by their practitioners to besignificant life projects.” I use ‘trans binary’ to prefer to persons who are trans but identifyexclusively within the male/female binary.11Wilchins (2007), 80-81.12Wilchins (2007), 80-81.3exclusively as a man or a woman. The second concerns these individuals’ viewsabout metaphysical questions concerning what, more generally, it means to begenderqueer. I rely on the first kind of testimony and not the second. Sub-stantive metaphysical questions about genderqueer deserve careful analysis injust the same way that women and men have been given careful metaphysicalanalysis. In this, I follow Bettcher (2004) in relying on persons’ first-personauthority over their own gender, while simultaneously allowing for substantivedisagreement about the conditions for kind membership. My central concern, inother words, is not individuals’ experiences, but rather the larger concepts thatframe genderqueer identity – in particular, the concepts that structure com-monality among the language, aesthetic expressions, values, and actions foundamong those who (within contemporary western societies) identify as neithersolely male not female.Finally, I am not concerned with how genderqueers are understood withindominant contexts, which typically have no or a distorted understanding ofnonbinary persons. Rather, I focus exclusively on the features and extension ofgenderqueer as they are understood and practiced within trans-friendly commu-nities, and especially by genderqueers themselves. Here I again follow Bettcher(2013, 234-5), who argues that assuming dominant gender meanings and con-cepts is a “bad place” to start feminist theorizing, as it “effectively yield[s]political ground from the very beginning.” With Bettcher, I instead begin byassuming the gender meanings and concepts within trans-friendly communities.3 First AttemptsWithin popular culture, most proposed definitions of genderqueer fall into oneof two camps. On one approach, someone is genderqueer because they have cer-tain external features–typically, because they are androgynous, gender fluid, orotherwise violate gender norms. On another approach, someone is genderqueerbecause of a particular internal feature–namely, self-identification–leaving openwhat, exactly, it might mean to ‘identify’ outside of the binary.It is instructive to note that most available metaphysical analyses of genderalso take one of these two approaches.13 On externalist approaches, someone’sgender is determined by social factors that are external to them: for example,being perceived as androgynous or otherwise gender non-conforming. In con-trast, internalist approaches focus on articulating more concretely what it meansto ‘identify’ with a particular gender. On these accounts, someone’s gender isdetermined not by how they are perceived by others, but rather by whateverinternal features (e.g., self-understanding, dispositions) constitute their genderidentity.1413I here focus on constructionist accounts of gender, setting aside biological essentialism.Even if one is a biological essentialist, though, it is hopefully obvious that this approachwill not suffice to analyze genderqueer. While some intersex persons are genderqueer, beingintersex is neither sufficient nor necessary for being genderqueer. See, e.g. Weiss (2018).14As Barnes (forthcoming) notes, while these are the main approaches, some theories fall4I argue that neither an externalist nor internalist approach will provide asatisfactory account of genderqueer. Both misclassify paradigm cases of gen-derqueer (and non-genderqueer) individuals. Examining closely why this is thecase is instructive. Not only will it clear the ground for my own proposal, but italso provides an opportunity to examine these paradigm cases, as well as gen-derqueer persons’ testimony concerning their own identities. Such testimonyilluminates not only why externalist and internalist approaches fall short, butalso why genderqueer is best understood as a political gender category.3.1 An Externalist ApproachExternal theories of gender, sometimes also called social position theories–focuson gender as a social structure that advantages or disadvantages individualsaccording to the collectives norms, expectations, and stereotypes surroundingthe features that an individual is perceived to have. Externalist theories havebeen proposed or defended by Haslanger (2000), Barnes (forthcoming), Witt(2011), and A´sta (2011), among others.15 There are many potential ways tospell out what external social factors determine an individual’s gender. For mypurposes, the details of various externalist accounts is not centrally important.What is important, rather, is to see a trend among all of them: namely, thatmembership in a given gender kind is based by factors that are external to anygiven individual–e.g., social roles, perception, or treatment.In light of this, what would be the best externalist approach to genderqueer?Whatever it is, it must highlight features that are external to genderqueer per-sons, while also meeting two basic criteria for any successful account of gen-derqueer: it must respect first-person accounts about what it means to be gen-derqueer, and it must capture paradigm cases of genderqueer as it exists withintrans-friendly communities. These two criteria are, of course, related, though itwould be possible to satisfy one without the other.The most common–and, I think, plausible–externalist approach to genderqueerfocuses on someone’s perceived relation to gender norms and roles, and espe-cially to masculine and feminist gender presentation. Indeed, a brief foray intopopular media might suggest that someone is genderqueer because they “dothings that are outside of the norm of their actual or perceived gender iden-tity,” or because they “express a combination of masculinity and femininity,or neither, in their gender expression.”16 A similar idea is echoed by popularoutside this taxonomy, such as Stoljar (2011), Briggs and George (manuscript), and Bach(2012).15Theodore Bach (2012) defends a view of gender on which genders are ‘natural kinds withhistorical essences’–a view that is difficult to place within the external/internalist taxonomy.On Bach’s view, to be, e.g., a woman, is to molded by conscious and unconscious socialmechanisms into a reproduction of historical exemplars of women so as to perform the socialfunction corresponding to women. On Bach’s view, then, someone might be a trans manand yet–according to Bach’s analysis–be “construed as a woman” (260). Moreover, giventhat man and woman are the only kinds into which one can be socialized (within Westerncultures), all genderqueer persons (who have been socialized as either women or men) will notbe represented within Bach’s analysis.16See Clements (2017) and the entry for “Genderqueer” on Wikipedia.5articles, books, and visual media that equivocate between or constantly asso-ciate being nonbinary with androgyny or gender non-conformity.17 Admittedly,this thinking is reinforced by the observation that many genderqueers fit thisdescription: it is common for persons who identify outside the binary to adoptan aesthetic that defies gender expectations–often, one that is androgynous oris fluid between masculine and feminine elements.18 Add to this that other be-haviors often associated with nonbinary persons also break gender norms, suchas using gender-neutral pronouns or refusing classification as either ‘straight’ or‘gay’.19 With these considerations, it might seem that the best way to analyzegenderqueer will be something like the following:Genderqueer (externalist): A person is genderqueer in a contextiff(i) They are reliably perceived as attempting to not exclusively adopteither a feminized or masculinized gender expression;or:(ii) Their body cannot be reliably coded in that context as eithermale or female.20In other words, on this proposal, someone is genderqueer in a context just incase they either are perceived as transgressing binary norms of gender expression–for example, by adopting a gender fluid or agender aesthetic–or their body isperceived as androgynous, where this is understood as one’s body being ‘un-readable’ as male or female.Despite the many merits of this approach, I think it fails both of the abovecriteria for a successful account genderqueer, and we ultimately should reject it.Seeing why, I think, also will show that any externalist approach will be dissat-isfactory. While many genderqueers do meet the above proposed condition, twofurther things are true. First, genderqueers often describe their androgyny orrejection of traditional gender aesthetic norms as either the motivation for oreffect of being genderqueer, but not as essential to being genderqueer. Whenasked to describe their experience of being genderqueer, in fact, there is repeatedand explicit rejection of the idea that being genderqueer is based on their genderpresentation or indeed on others’ perceptions in any way. In their article “ThisIs What Gender-Nonbinary People Look Like”, trans activist Meridith Talusan17See, e.g., Dowling (2017), Ferguson (2017), Petrow (2016).18See the Instagram hashtag “#thisiswhatnblookslike.”19For more evidence on the connection between trans identifications and violating het-eronormative gender expectations and roles, see Diamond and Butterworth (2008) and Green(2004). See also Nagoshi, et al. (2012), in which participants took their sexual orientation tobe “dynamically related” to their gender identity, suggesting that being nonbinary often rulesout, for these persons, being either ‘straight’ or ‘gay’.20These descriptions bear similarity to Elizabeth Barnes’s (forthcoming) description of the‘gender outlier’ and ‘gender confounder’. Barnes, who is sympathetic to Sally Haslanger’s(2012) picture on which gender is a hierarchical system that socially positions persons indifferent ways based on their perceived features, describes the gender outlier and confounder asthose who are systematically subordinated due to being perceived (respectively) as attemptingto switch between binary gender roles or as androgynous.6asked genderqueer persons to describe their experience of identifying outsideof the gender binary. While answers varied in their details, a common themeemerged: being genderqueer is not based on being perceived in any particularway. One interviewee, Rowan Keeney, put this quite bluntly:My expression and my socialization falls on the femme side, butbeing nonbinary is not about what is perceived of me. Nonbinaryis the liberation from the need to make myself smaller to fit intopreconceived ideas of who and what I am.21Keeney’s point is independently reiterated by other genderqueer persons,who express that “there is no one way to be nonbinary”, that “name[s], pro-nouns, and presentation does not define [a nonbinary individual’s] gender”, andthat genderqueers “have all types of gender presentations”, “identify as fem-inine and masculine to different degrees”, and “don’t need to look or act orbe a certain way to be nonbinary”.22 Susanna Weiss, a writer for Teen Voguewho identifies as both genderqueer and a woman, is particularly explicit on thispoint:Many people seem to believe you need an androgynous style to benon-binary, creating the assumption that I and other non-binarypeople who wear women’s clothes must be women... But you can’ttell how someone identifies based on what they look like.23A theme clearly emerges from these statements: those who are genderqueerreject the idea that their being genderqueer is explained by being perceived tofall outside of binary gender roles, or as having an androgynous presentation.Whatever it is to be genderqueer, then, seems that it cannot be captured interms of others’ perceptions.Complimenting this point is the observation that the externalist approachwould produce the wrong extension. Many individuals who do not identify asand would not be considered genderqueer either defy binary gender roles ormaintain androgyny.24 Butch lesbians, queens, cross-dressing men and women,trans men and women who do not ‘blend’ as cisgender, and the variety of menand women whose bodies and presentations are androgynous are but a fewexamples of this. Lori Watson, examining shared experiences between gendernonconforming persons, trans and not, vividly captures this point:Trans women and I share an especially acute problem. [W]e bothwant our gender to be seen as a way of being a woman...who doesn’thave to offer up her bona fides to the world anytime someone isconfused, perplexed or unsettled when they perceive our gender andsex as incongruous or ambiguous.2521Talusan (2017), emphasis added.22Talusan (2017), Weiss (2018).23Weiss (2018).24For empirical discussion, see Bradford, et al. (2018).25Watson (2015).7In short, genderqueers do not have a monopoly on being perceived as violat-ing gender roles, much less on androgyny: plenty of non-genderqueer men andwomen share in this experience.We can add to this that, within genderqueer communities, being perceivedin either of these ways is not taken to be a requirement for being genderqueer.Weiss, for example, notes that after they began identifying as genderqueer,they did not change anything about their (feminine) gender expression. Twoof Weiss’s interviewees, Kelley Cantrell and Alaina Leary, articulated similarexperiences. Both were assigned female at birth and have feminine gender pre-sentations, and thereby are perceived regularly as gender conforming women.Nevertheless, both identify outside of the gender binary.26 Importantly, theiridentities would not (in general) be taken as delusional or otherwise mistakenin trans-friendly contexts: Weiss presents Cantrell and Leary as unquestionablygenderqueer, despite being routinely read as gender conforming women.27While taking genderqueer as separable from any particular social percep-tions may seem initially odd, it comes into better focus when we take seriouslythat being genderqueer is not so much about rejecting femininity and masculin-ity de re, but rather rejecting them as concepts that always are appropriatefor interpreting an individual’s behavior or aesthetic.28 That is, according togenderqueer persons, being genderqueer need not be about refusing clothing, be-haviors, speech, or roles that typically would be read as feminine, masculine, orany combination of the two. Rather, it often concerns rejecting the binary at aconceptual level – that is, rejecting the idea that their way of being in the worldshould be understood via the binary concepts of ‘feminine’ and ‘masculine’.29In an interview with The Washington Post, 18-year-old Kelsey Beckham, whoidentifies as nonbinary, states:I don’t want to be a girl wearing boy’s clothes, nor do I want tobe a girl who presents as a boy. I just want to be a person who isrecognized as a person. That’s how I’m most comfortable. I’m justa person wearing people clothes.30The bold assertion of being ‘just a person wearing people clothes’ strikes asthe heart of any attempt to analyze genderqueer in terms of external percep-tions. Genderqueers differ widely with respect to their assigned sex, perceived26Weiss (2018)27A further, normative worry arises for taking genderqueer in terms of androgyny in par-ticular: for many body sizes and shapes, androgyny is difficult if not impossible to access.Persons in this position would be simply barred from access to genderqueer.28See, e.g. Weiss (2018) who writes that being gender, for them, mean “reject[ing] the wholeconcept of gender.”29For example, Weiss quotes Cantrell as saying “I wish that people wouldn’t automaticallyuse she/her pronouns just because of how I present... They need to stop gendering people’spresentations.” As Naomi Scheman pointed out to me, the plea to end gendering based onpresentation is important, as it reveals a political stance that–intentionally or not–queerseveryone’s gender.30Hesse (2014), my emphasis.8sex, and whether or not they function within traditionally masculinized or fem-inized gender roles. If anything holds them in common with respect to genderpresentation, it is only a general rejection of being understood through a binarylens.313.2 An Internalist ApproachIf looking only to external features will not provide an adequate analysis ofgenderqueer, what about looking to internal features? Perhaps an internalistapproach, or an approach on which being genderqueer is determined primarilyby one’s internal features, has more promise. In favor of this approach, it at leastappears to align nicely with what is by far the most common popular definition ofbeing genderqueer as ‘identifying as genderqueer’.32 If we assume ‘identification’is best understood as a wholly internal feature–i.e., a psychological state thatan individual can be in without any material manifestations–then an internalistapproach to genderqueer would be on the right track. I’ll propose in §4 that weshould prefer a different, political model of genderqueer. But let’s examine themerits of an internalist account.The first and most important question for an internalist approach to gen-derqueer is what internal features we are referring to when we talk about ‘genderidentity’. Since the concept of gender identity–and in particular, genderqueeridentity–is used to determine the extension of genderqueer, it is crucial to under-stand what genderqueer identity amount to. What’s more, as Jenkins (forthcom-ing) points out, the most common ‘folk’ definition of gender identity–“a senseof oneself as a man, woman, or some other gender”–does not appear promising.Jenkins writes:[M]any people who use the language of gender identity hold...theview that gender terms such as ‘man’ and ‘woman’ ought to beunderstood in terms of gender identity: [e.g.] to be a woman is toidentify as a woman (or, to have a female gender identity)... Thecombination of this view with the folk definition of gender identitygives rise to a circularity: someone who asks what it means to saythat a certain person ‘has a female gender identity’ will be told thatit means that that person has a sense of herself ‘as a woman’ – butif the questioner then asks what a ‘woman’ is, they will be told thata woman is ‘a person with a female gender identity’.Jenkins’s point about ‘woman’ similarly applies to ‘genderqueer’. The com-bination of two popular notions–that being genderqueer is identifying as gen-derqueer, and identifying as genderqueer is being genderqueer–leaves us in a31See also “Gender Can Be Both Liberating And Stifling At The Same Time” (2018), inwhich one interviewee comments, “Just because I put on lipstick doesn’t mean I am one thingor the other, because someone decide a piece of paint ‘belonged’ to a gender.”32The language of ‘gender identity’ as a determiner of one’s gender–and, in particular, ofbeing genderqueer, is standard within trans-friendly contexts. See Weiss (2018) and Talu-san (2017), as well as genderqueer networking platforms such as http://genderqueer.me orhttp://beyondthebinary.co.uk.9hopeless and unhelpful circularity. Whatever it means to ‘identify as genderqueer’–if indeed this is the basis for being genderqueer, must be something some moresubstantive.Within analytic philosophy, two internalist proposals have emerged as towhat this more substantive notion of gender identity amounts to.33At first, a substantive internalism might seem to worryingly essentialize gen-der by pointing to a mysterious, innate sense of one’s own gender that existsindependently of external social factors. But, in fact, philosophical accounts ofgender identity avoid this worry: gender identity, on these accounts, is internal,but it is based on one’s internal or subjective way of relating to societies’ gendernorms, structures, and interpretive guides.34 One one approach, defended byJennifer McKitrick (2015), someone’s gender in a given context is determinedby their behavioral dispositions, along with how those behaviors–if manifested–would be socially interpreted. In a given context, McKitrick argues, someonewho is disposed to behave in ways that others would take to be indicative ofa woman, has a woman’s gender identity (and so, is a woman) in that con-text.35 Like McKitrick, Jenkins’s (2016, forthcoming) account of gender iden-tity emphasizes an individual’s relationship to external gender norms. Jenkinsproposes a ‘norm relevance’ account, on which an individual’s gender identityis determined by what norms that are associated with a particular gender theyexperience as relevant to them.36 That is, for example, someone has a femalegender identity–and so is a woman–on this account if they experience normsassociated with women in their social context as relevant to them. Moreover,norm relevance can take on a variety of forms. A female gender identity for oneperson may amount to feeling like others should refer to her with feminine pro-nouns and a certain name, whereas for someone else, it may amount to havingthe sense that her physical features ought to be a certain way – e.g., ought toinclude a vulva, and not a penis.37Gender identities, on both approaches, have subjective and objective el-ements: they are subjective insofar as they concern internal dispositions orsenses of norm relevance, but objective insofar as these dispositions or sensesmust relate to norms or behaviors that are externally, socially associated witha certain gender group.38 Both McKitrick’s and Jenkins’s approaches couldbe applied to ‘genderqueer identity’. In fact, Jenkins explicitly proposes onesuch application: someone is genderqueer iff they do not consider the norms33On Talia Bettcher’s (2009), (2013) view, a person’s gender is based on sincere self-identification, understood in terms of ‘living as’ the gender with which one identifies, I willnot address this view in what follows because, while Bettcher’s view may be the best wayto understand binary gender identities, it runs into many of the same concerns I raise forMcKitrick’s (2015) and Jenkins’s (2016) accounts when applied to genderqueer.34See, e.g., McKitrick (2015), 2580 for an explicit rejection of the essentialism worry.35The precise formulation of this idea is as follows: “x is gender G iff x has (sufficientlymany, sufficiently strong) dispositions D1-Dn to behave in ways B1-Bn in situations S1-Sn,and the relevant social group considers behaving in ways B1-Bn in situations S1-Sn to be G.”McKitrick (2015), 2581.36Jenkins (forthcoming).37Jenkins (2016), 413.38Jenkins (2016), 412.10socially associated with men, nor the norms socially associated with women,to be relevant to them.39 To illustrate, Jenkins uses the example of a build-ing that contains only men’s and women’s toilets. Someone who is nonbinary,because they do not consider the norms governing social spaces for either mennor women as relevant to them, may “have all toilets marked as uncomfortableplaces fraught with stress and danger.”40The first thing to notice is that Jenkins’s norm relevancy approach to maleand female gender identity differs dramatically from the approach to nonbinarygender identity. On this account, so long as someone considers some of thefemale-coded (or male-coded) norms as relevant to them, they have a female (ormale) gender identity.41 After all, the number of men and women who take allof the norms associated with men or women as relevant to them likely is fewand far between. But notice that this feature is taken to immediately constrainthe proposed definition of nonbinary (or, in my terms, genderqueer) identities:according to Jenkins, it cannot simply be the case that nonbinary persons donot take some or even most of the binary-coded norms as relevant to them.Rather, they must take none of those norms as relevant to them. Here, thedefinition begins to generate serious worries.First, this proposal rules out the possibility of having a genderqueer iden-tity as well as a male or female identity. But some persons who identify asgenderqueer also identify as women or men. Weiss (2018), for example, writes:I personally identify as a non-binary woman... [T]o me, this identityacknowledges both that I don’t have an innate identification withany gender and that I’ve been socialized as a woman. Having morethan one gender identity means different things to others, though.42Weiss is not alone. In the same article, they interview 24-year-old ReyNoble, who identifies as non-binary and a woman. According to Noble, this isto “acknowledge that she loves her female-coded body but doesn’t always feelit accurately represents her.”43 Similarly, Laurie Penny, a UK based journalist,articulates having distinct but compatible reasons for identifying as genderqueerand as a women. “My identity is more complex than simply female or male,”Penny writes, “but...I am a woman, politically because that’s how people see meand that’s how the state treats me.”44 Weiss’s, Noble’s, and Penny’s testimoniesare in tune with empirical research on genderqueer identities: In Galupo, et al’s39Jenkins uses the term ‘nonbinary’ rather than genderqueer, and more formally puts thisidea as follows: “S has a nonbinary gender identity iff S’s internal ‘map’ is neither formedso as to guide someone marked as a woman through the social or material realities that are,in that context, characteristic of women as a class nor formed to guide someone classed as aman through the social or material realities that are, in that context, characteristic of men asa class. Jenkins ((2016), 411, fn 40). See also Jenkins (forthcoming).40Jenkins (forthcoming).41Jenkins thinks that someone could have, for this reason, more than one gender identityin a given context.42Weiss (2018).43Weiss (2018).44Penny (2015).11(2018) study of genderqueer persons, many participants described their genderin ways that include, but are not bound by only one of the binary options:“My gender changes. Sometimes I am female, sometimes I am a boy,sometimes I am both, and sometimes I am neither.” (genderfluid)“Sometimes I feel like I am completely a man. Sometimes I feel like Iam mostly a man, with some woman/agender mixed in.” (demiguy)“I can switch in between a variety of genders (man, woman, androg-yne, agender, third gender, polygender, etc.) day by day.” (gender-fluid)45In short, many persons who identify outside a single binary option also mightidentify as a woman and/or man, in Jenkins’s sense. For this reason, thesetestimonies run counter to Jenkins’s proposal. This empirical research, then,suggests that “[genderqueer] participants’ gender identity could not be discretelyconceptualized as ‘male’ ‘female’ ‘neither’ or ‘both’.”46 While Jenkins take the‘neither’ approach, this way of thinking maintains binary gender options, anddoes not align with data concerning how nonbinary individuals describe theiridentities.47But suppose explicit disavowal of being a man or woman is not necessaryfor having a genderqueer identity, because such avowals are outside of the realmof male- and female-coded norms. Even this weakened understanding of gen-derqueer identity would be inadequate, for reasons that also appear in Penny’sand Weiss’s recognition of how ‘socialization’ as a woman, and being seen asa woman by the state and others impacts one’s ability to move through theworld. Genderqueers frequently maintain, if only out of necessity, a sense ofwhat binary-coded norms are relevant for them in spaces where there is no al-ternative to these norms. Rejecting binary-coded norms altogether is simplynot an option when the social world is saturated in exclusive, binary divisions.Public spaces, such as restrooms and locker rooms, legal institutions, socialclubs, language, and marketing, to name but a few, are heavily gendered, andgendered not only according to the binary, but in a way that leaves someoneattempting to navigate these structure no choice but to ‘pick a side’. That is,because all (or nearly all) genderqueer persons were socialized as either men orwomen, and are perceived as men or women, only self-applying the norms of ‘aperson wearing people clothes’ is not possible. Genderqueers who wish to navi-gate the world at all, much less safely, have no option but to see binary-normsas more or less relevant to them.48At this point, someone might protest that genderqueer identity is markedby a feeling of discomfort or inauthenticity with (complying with) those norms.45Galupo, et al. (2018), 12. Participants’ prefer gender labels are in parentheses.46Galupo, et al. (2018), 18.47Galupo, et al. (2018), 18.48Andler (2017) raises similar worries for Jenkins’s account of gender identity.12But this dramatically over-generates: many non-genderqueer men or womenalso feel discomfort and inauthenticity complying with the gender norms thatthey are socially coerced to obey.49Setting aside a norm-relevancy approach to genderqueer identity, then, whatabout a dispositional approach? Why not think that being genderqueer is lessabout what norms one’s consider relevant to oneself, but rather about whatone is internally disposed to do–e.g., use gender neutral pronouns, assert ‘I amgenderqueer’, and so on? Such an approach might amount to something alongthe following lines:S is genderqueer in a context C iff S is sufficiently disposed to be-have in C in ways that would (in trans-friendly contexts) mark S asgenderqueer.50What might the behaviors be? On a one interpretation, the relevant behav-iors for being genderqueer would be different in content, but not in kind fromthose for being men and women. That is, the behavioral dispositions relevantto being genderqueer would include dispositions toward things like “modes ofdress, posture and mannerisms, productive and leisure time activities, styles ofcommunication and social interaction.”51 But, as we already saw in §3.1, nosuch external behaviors decidedly mark someone as genderqueer.Given this, the scope of relevant behaviors is significantly constrained. Infact, it seems that the only behaviors that would decidedly mark someone asgenderqueer in a trans-friendly context is them (sincerely) saying so.52 On thisaccount then, someone is genderqueer so long as they are sufficiently disposedto assert that they do not exclusively identify as a man or a woman: e.g., ‘I amgenderqueer’, ‘I am nonbinary’, ‘I am gender fluid’.53Here, two further worries arise. The first concerns the manifestation condi-tions for these dispositions. I suspect that much of the motivation for adoptinga dispositionalist account of genderqueer identity is gaining the ability to countpersons as genderqueer even when these dispositions are masked or counteractedby social costs, such as the threat of bullying, discrimination, being fired, as-saulted, or simply misunderstood. Rather than seeing someone as genderqueer49Recall that Jenkins (forthcoming) suggests that a nonbinary person would uniquely feelthat gender-marked toilets are “uncomfortable places fraught with stress and danger.” Noticethis would also be true for a gender non-conforming woman or man, an androgynous womanor man, or perhaps even just a woman or man who dislikes being in gender-marked spaces.50This proposal is an adaption from McKitrick (2016), who does not emphasize trans-friendly contexts. This proposal would, for reasons that are hopefully clear, be even furtheroff target: in dominant context, no behaviors would mark someone as genderqueer, becausethis category is not recognized in those contexts.51McKitrick (2016), 2581.52Although not framed dispositionally, a similar proposal was suggested by Riki Wilchins(2017), 101: “With nonbinary people, it is the identifying act of saying one is ‘nonbi-nary’...which is central to identity?”53I don’t leave open that assertion occurs in many ways, including writing, sign-language,etc. Many nonbinary youth depend on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube,to communicate their gender identification. See Singh (2013), 698.13only in contexts where they in fact say so, a dispositionalist approach would al-low us to count as genderqueer anyone considers themself genderqueer, such thatthey would–under certain conditions–assert that they are genderqueer. Someonewho is prevented from openly asserting a genderqueer identity due social costs,then, can still be genderqueer.Given this, the thought goes, we should privilege how that person wouldbe, were it less-or-not-at-all socially costly, to be genderqueer. From here, wearrive at the idea that someone is genderqueer just in case, were the socialcosts sufficiently low, they would assert that they do not (or do not exclusively)identify exclusively as a man or a woman. But what are these conditions? Ifthey are ones where some social costs remain, then it would seem to preventthose with low risk tolerance from being genderqueer: some people who might bewilling to assert a genderqueer identity under no social costs might be unwillingto do so even in the face of small or infrequent costs. So leaving any social costsin the manifestation conditions means that only some people, but not others,can have internalized genderqueer identity.Suppose, then, the manifestation conditions are ones with no social costs.First, it seems likely that, in such a scenario, many persons who currently andcomfortably identify exclusively within the binary might begin to assert other,nonbinary identities.54 That is, if being nonbinary were completely sociallyaccepted, such that no difficulties or prejudices faced those resisting binarycategorization, why think that only those who under actual conditions do notconsider themselves nonbinary would continue to do so? Regardless of whichway we go, then, it seems this view gets the extension of genderqueer wrong evenby its own lights: it will either exclude anyone with a low risk tolerance withrespect to asserting a genderqueer identity, or extend the category to personswho in fact take themselves to have (only) a binary identity, but might thinkotherwise in lieu of social repercussions.The second, and I think even more important worry for this dispositionalaccount is that it metaphysically trivializes being genderqueer. Regardless ofthe manifestation conditions for a dispositional account, we’ve seen that themost plausible behaviors that, when manifested, would be socially considereddeterminative of being genderqueer are assertions that one is genderqueer. But,in that case, being genderqueer amounts to nothing more than a linguistic con-struction: there is nothing substantively different between someone who is andsomeone who is not genderqueer. The only difference is that one, but not theother, is disposed to use certain terms to describe themself. On this disposi-tional account, no difference other than this, is necessary (or sufficient) for beinggenderqueer. It is hard to see, for this reason, what the content of such termsmight be, or what the difference between ‘sincere’ and ‘non-sincere’ assertion ofidentity might amount to. Genderqueer seems reduced to an empty (or at leastopaque) label.It may turn out, in the end, that genderqueer identity amounts to nothing54The same point holds for the scenario with very low social costs, but is more obviouswhen all costs are removed.14more than self-describing using certain terms. But if possible, we should–and Ithink can–do better. To that end, I turn now to a new proposal: genderqueeras a critical gender kind.4 A New Approach: Critical Gender KindsWhat explains being genderqueer? Is asserting one’s preferred gender labelsufficient? Is it necessary? Is gender non-conformity or androgyny sufficient,even if not necessary? These questions are complicated by the fact that, as we’veseen, purely external factors are insufficient for understanding genderqueer, andappealing instead to gender identity only pushes us to ask what might constitutea genderqueer identity. While it is tempting to think of this identity in termsof wholly internal features, such as a sense of norm relevance or a disposition toassert an identity claim, we’ve seen why these approaches fall short. So whatcould the difference between genderqueer and non-genderqueer persons amountto?The solution, I suggest, lies in seeing genderqueer as designated not in termsof external or internal features, but rather in terms of political features. Inparticular, I suggest that being genderqueer is based on manifesting a particularkind of resistance to the assumption that one’s exclusive and exhaustive genderoptions are being a man or being a woman. To be genderqueer, on this view,is to resist the ideology that demands that one exclusively be either a man ora woman, and do so based on one’s sense of one’s own gendered ontologicalposition.What is the best way to understand a gender kind of this sort? I proposethat, to do so, we must recognize a new type of gender kind: critical genderkinds.Critical Gender Kinds: For some kind X, X is a critical genderkind relative to a given society iff membership in X is predicated onmanifesting personal resistance against the dominant gender ideol-ogy in that society.55Note that, on this definition, members of critical gender kinds not only exter-nalize resistance to dominant gender ideology, but do so in a personal way–thatis, resistance motivated by personal reasons for opposing the dominant genderideology. Personal resistance is, on my view, a broad category that contains atleast two importantly distinct, but compatible modes of resistance: ideologicalpersonal resistance and existential personal resistance. We can understand theseas follows:Ideological Personal Resistance: To manifest ideological per-sonal resistance to dominant gender ideology is to engage in behav-ior that challenges that ideology, where this behavior stems from orotherwise expresses one’s ideological commitments.55Following Haslanger (manuscript), I here use ‘ideology’ to mark a nefarious system ofsocial meaning that guides practical life.15Existential Personal Resistance: To manifest existential per-sonal resistance to dominant gender ideology is to engage in behav-ior that challenges that ideology, where this behavior stems from orotherwise expresses one’s own perceived or claimed gendered cate-gorization (or lack thereof).Ideological personal resistance is a common practice, shared among a va-riety of activists, allies, and members of gender and sexual minority groups.For example, whenever someone speaks out against sexist, transphobic, or het-eronormative practices and does so from their ideological commitment to genderor sexual equality, this person enacts ideological personal resistance to dominantgender ideology. Attending take Back the Night marches or gay pride parades,voting for politicians who support trans-rights, donating to organizations thatadvocate for women’s reproductive rights, using gender-neutral pronouns, orhaving a gender non-conforming aesthetic are just a few examples of resistantbehaviors that are open to everyone. Many engage in these behaviors not (ornot only) because of their own gendered position, but (also) because they havevalues and beliefs that commit them to resist dominant assumptions, norms, andpractices concerning gender. These persons are, in my view, jointly engaged inideological personal resistance to dominant gender ideology.More can and should be said about ideological personal resistance. Butbecause my account of genderqueer relies on the notion of existential personalresistance, I devote my attention to explicating this notion. Unlike its sibling,existential personal resistance stems from one’s sensed or claimed place withingender categories – typically, a position that is deviant given the practices,norms, and structures that arise from and sustain dominant gender ideology.To more sharply distinguish between these modes of resistance, suppose youmeet two persons who use the gender neutral pronouns ‘they/them’. One doesnot consider themself nonbinary in any sense, but uses these pronouns becausethey are committed to making English more hospitable for nonbinary persons.The other uses these pronouns because they consider themself genderqueer, andso take ‘she’ and ‘he’ to misdescribe their sensed or claimed gender. In this case,it may be that both persons manifest ideological person-personal resistance tothe dominant gender assumption that everyone is either as a man or a woman.But only the second person manifests existential personal resistance to this as-sumption. And this is because the second, but not the first, engages in resistantbehavior–i.e., their use of gender neutral pronouns–that stems from their sensedor claimed ontological position as neither a woman nor a man. In line with thisexample, I propose that the key mark of existential personal resistance is thesource of one’s resistant behaviors: namely, as stemming from or expressingone’s own sensed or claimed gendered categorization.The distinction between ideological and existential personal resistance helpsus articulate the difference between allies of and members of gender kinds such asgenderqueer, trans, androgyne, etc.: while both resist dominant gender ideology,members of these kinds resist (at least in part) because they take themselvesto occupy a deviant ontological position. Who they take themselves to be is16itself incompatible with or otherwise does not conform to normative ontologicalpositions within dominant gender ideology. Importantly, though, this is notan internalistic notion of kind membership: while a sensed or claimed gendercategorization goes into critical gender kind membership, it is not sufficientfor kind membership. Manifested resistance is also required. Moreover, byincluding ‘claimed’ alongside ‘sensed’, I am not attempting to capture genderidentity in Jenkins’s or McKitrick’s sense. This ‘claiming’ can be based onpolitical (or perhaps religious) motivations, as well as based on an internal feltsense of gender authenticity, relevance, or belonging.56To be clear, critical gender kinds are not the only political gender kinds–i.e.,the only gender kinds whose members stand in personal, reactive relationshipsto dominant gender ideology. Everyone manifests some personal reactions–bothexistential and ideological–to gender ideology. When these reactions affirmsdominant ideology, we can describe those who manifest them as belonging tonon-critical gender kinds:Non-Critical Gender Kinds: For some kind X, X is a non-criticalgender kind relative to a given society iff membership in X is predi-cated on manifesting personal reenforcement of the dominant genderideology in that society.As above, we can divide personal reenforcement into both ideological andexistential modes. Someone who considers themself a man and on this basisenacts a hegemonic masculinity (relational to his class, race, etc.) manifestsexistential personal reenforcement of the dominant assumption that men oughtto behave in stereotypically masculine ways. In contrast, someone who considersthemself a woman but supports men’s rights groups or uses slurs to describe gaymen, and does so on the basis of their beliefs about how men (and women) oughtto behave, manifests ideological, but not existential personal reenforcement ofthis dominant assumption.A single individual can belong to a variety of gender kinds. The critical/non-critical distinction is not a further binary into which individuals can be exclu-sively sorter. We all belong to a variety of political gender kinds–e.g., critical andnon-critical–as well as externalist and internalist gender kinds. My focus hereis on genderqueer as a particular, critical gender kind. But my account does notpreclude that genderqueer persons simultaneously belong to many more genderkinds.Of course, saying that genderqueer is a critical gender kind is nowhere nearthe level of specificity needed to understand this kind. Even once we narrow ourscope to dominant Western contexts, we find there are many possible criticalgender kinds, and they can be identified to various degrees of specificity, relativeto how fine-grained one describes (an aspect of) the dominant gender ideology.5756Thanks to Alicia Fowler for alerting me to the possibility of religious-based resistance tothe binary assumption.57Some may not want to count these kinds as gender kinds: again, I am uninterested infighting over ‘what gender is’ as if it must be one thing. It is plain that critical gender kindsare an important part of the social landscape related to gender, and that is enough for me.17To draw this out, and begin to motivate thinking of genderqueer as a criticalgender kind, let’s consider the gender ideology that dominates in most Westernsocieties. Very broadly speaking, a vast number of social groups resist thisideology (often/always in a personal way): to name but a name, trans men,trans women, abortion rights activists, butch dykes, drag queens, genderqueers,stay-at-home dads, female powerlifters, tomboys, polyamorous persons and onand on. Many groups and individuals, and in many ways, resist normative,gendered social expectations regarding their bodies, presentations, gender roles,and other ways of being.On one way of thinking about critical gender kinds, then, all of these variousand sundry groups might be classified together within one kind:(Western) Gender Defiers: Someone is a (Western) gender defierjust in case they enact personal resistance against the dominantgender ideology in Western societies.In at least two ways, this definition is not particularly illuminating. First,how might one go about deciding who does or does not count as a genderdefier without a more detailed analysis of what composes the dominant genderideology in question? Second, with respect to genderqueer, if genderqueers makeup but one piece of gender defiers, this does not illuminate what is unique togenderqueer. It seems that, in order to give an analysis of genderqueer, we needa better idea of what aspect of dominant gender ideology genderqueers resist, aswell as how they do so. All in all: more details are needed.To this end, I propose a more (but still not very) fine-grained, tripartitepicture of Western dominant gender ideology.58 On this picture, the ideologycan be thought of as having three distinct, but interconnected and mutuallyreinforcing axes: the genital assumption, the binary assumption, and the so-cial assumption. While no one of these axes can be fully understood apartfrom the others, for the sake of analysis we can somewhat artificially take eachindividually:58This picture diverges from, but was inspired by a description of ‘the postcolonial under-standing of gender’ in Tan (manuscript).18The genital assumption: Someone’s gender is determined by theirnatal anatomical reproductive features.The binary assumption: The only possible genders are the bi-nary, exclusive, and exhaustive kinds men and women.59The social assumption: Someone’s gender determines60 whattheir social role ought to be.61All three axes together establish an ideology that exclusively divides bodiesinto two categories, and establishes a self-perpetuating hierarchy between themwith those sexed as males placed in a position of dominance over those sexed asfemales.62 With this framework, we could spell out a variety of (non-exclusive!)critical gender kinds that existentially or ideologically resist the genital and so-cial assumptions. For example, anyone resisting the assumption that they belong59The binary assumption builds normative social roles into men and women (perhaps inaddition to genital information). A genderqueer person does not reject the idea that theymust have, e.g., either a penis or a vagina: in rejecting the binary assumption, they arerejecting the notion that they must exclusively belong to one of two kinds with normativesocial roles.60By this, I do not mean to imply that gender is assumed to ‘wholly determine’ one’s socialrole, given that even within this ideology, people often assume that other, intersecting socialidentities–such as race, class, and ability–also determine someone’s social role.61Here I follow, but make a tripartite distinction within feminist theories on which genderwithin Western contexts is “traditionally assumed to be based on a binary, mandatory systemthat attributes social characteristics to sexed anatomy, with humans categorized from birth asmale vs female based on their external genitalia.” See Nagoshi, et al. (2012), 407, referencingHausman (2001).62Though, of course, much more goes into the social assumptions for ‘females’ and ‘males’than things that establish or perpetuate this hierarchy. Indeed, I do not mean to suggest that(many aspects of) masculinity and femininity per se are problematic–an unfortunate sugges-tion of previous versions of feminism–but rather that gendered social roles are problematicwhen policed along the lines of binary, biological categories.19to the gender that they were assigned based on natal reproductive features–aproperty I consider sufficient for being trans–manifests existential personal re-sistance to the genital assumption. Similarly, anyone who considers themself abutch lesbian, defying social expectations with respect to their presentation andgender role, resists the social assumption.63I propose that genderqueer is best understood as a critical gender kind thatresists the binary assumption. More specifically, I propose that its membersmanifest existential personal resistance against the assumption that they mustbelong to one of two (and only two!) gender kinds that do not overlap (discrete),and where everyone fall into one of these two kinds (exhaustive). Moreover,they do so on the basis of a sensed or claimed gender categorization that isontologically incompatible with this assumption. We can put this more formallyas follows:Genderqueer: Genderqueer is a critical gender kind, such that itsmembers have a sensed or claimed gender categorization that con-flicts with the binary assumption, and on this basis enact resistanceagainst this assumption.64On this proposed understanding of genderqueer, genderqueers externalize re-sistance to the binary assumption, and do so in an existentially based, personalway.65 Such resistance entails a disposition to interpretation of one’s resistantbehaviors as behaviors stemming from or otherwise expressing one’s ontologicalposition as in tension with this assumption. This point is important becauseit demarcates genderqueer as a kind such that self-perception, and not externalinterpretation, is central to membership. Without this feature of the account,genderqueer would not exist in dominant contexts where the majority of peoplelack awareness of gender possibilities outside the binary. In these contexts, noparticular presentation, use of language, and so on–short of explicit assertionssuch as “I am not a man or a woman!”–would be interpreted as resisting thebinary assumption. Moreover, as we’ve seen in §3.1, no particular external fea-tures make someone genderqueer. Androgyny, use of gender neutral pronouns,etc. are features that not only are not universal among genderqueers, but also63While various targets of resistance are compatible, in principle one might resist only oneaxis. In fact, one way of interpreting the position of ‘radical feminists’ who discount transidentities is that, while they resist the social assumption, they reenforce the genital and binaryassumptions.64I do not mean to suggest that all genderqueers resist the binary assumption under thistheoretical guise. Most often, they intentionally reject the idea that they must be neatly andpermanently categorized as either a man or woman–that they must comply with the systemof gender classification–and I suggest this amounts to resisting the binary assumption. Thisrejection is still very much ideological resistance, even if not conceptualized that way. This isthe familiar feminist point that the ’personal is political’: even if a genderqueer person doesnot conceptualize (e.g.) use of gender-neutral pronouns as ideological resistance, it is.65As the binary assumption is stated, someone who moves between male and female identity,but never rejects or accepts both simultaneously, is not in conflict with the binary assumption.I am torn about this case: if one thinks that such a person does resist the binary assumption,’inflexibility’ or ’permanence’ of one’s gender could be added to the binary assumption.20are shared by some person who are not genderqueer. No particular externalfeature(s) are either necessary or sufficient to be genderqueer.Nor do I think any internal feature–for example, a dislike of being genderedwithin the binary, or an intention to resist the binary assumption–is sufficient.Genderqueer, for better and worse, isn’t simply in the head. For one thing, thiswould overextend genderqueer. No doubt, many people who would not considerthemselves (or be considered) genderqueer dislike being gendered within thebinary, but have resigned themselves to it or otherwise accepted it as part oftheir lives. For another, this would remove the force of queer within genderqueer.If being genderqueer were simply in the head, a world functioning smoothlyaccording to the binary assumption, with no one ever materially challengingthis binary, could very well be a world full of genderqueers. This, to me, seemslike a reductio: resistance to gender binary systems requires more than merethought. This point aligns with genderqueers’ description of being nonbinary asa way of “reject[ing] such [binary] systems that lead to harmful stereotypes andoppression” and “breaking down what it means to be a gendered person in theworld.”66 Neither resistance nor breaking down others’ assumptions can occurmerely within one’s own head.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I am skeptical that any single mentalcontent accompanies sensing or claiming gender categorization outside of thebinary. Most obviously, the construction of binary gender kinds (men/women),as well as the latitude individuals have within them and how individuals aresocialized into them, vary dramatically across intersections with other socialidentities, such as race, class, and ability. For this reason as well, then, mymodel intentionally leaves open that within the group of genderqueer persons,one can (and I suspect will) find a vast range of concepts about and attitudestowards these binary kinds.67What does matter, then? Genderqueer, I suggest, is found at the intersectionof external and internal features. In particular, it is an certain way of being inthe world–namely, enacting existential personal resistance to the practices andstructures that arise from and reinforce the binary assumption. This enactingis multiply realizable: again, there is no one, much less one right way to be gen-derqueer. Many forms of enactment are possible, so long as they are taken froman existential stance. Some common ways will be familiar: using gender-neutralpronouns (and other terms, like titles), cultivating gender non-conforming aes-thetics, asserting one’s gender status, queering personal relationships, defyingsexual binaries, and what I’ll call ‘space switching’, or moving between male andfemale gendered spaces. While, again, none of these features is unique to or re-quired in order to be genderqueer, they are familiar tools that genderqueers useto resist the idea that they themselves fall into one of two discrete, exhaustivegender kinds. What they share–and what is, I think, a constraint on behaviorsthat resist dominant gender ideology–is that they violate what Kate Bornstein(1994) call the ‘gender rules’: the binary set of norms that are imposed and en-66Taluson (2017).67Thanks to Jorge Meneses for raising this point.21forced (via social practices and material structures) upon individuals accordingto the sexed interpretation of their bodies.68 Violating these rules challengesor defies such practices and structures. As these practices and structures aremany, so too are the possible modes of resistance, which we again can expect tovary widely across intersectional contexts and individuals. To name but a few:1. Gender-neutral pronouns: Communicating that one uses gender neu-tral pronouns (e.g., ze/zim/zis, they/them/theirs) rather than a genderspecific pronoun (e.g., he/him/his, she/her/hers).692. Gender non-conforming aesthetic: Gender presentations that violatecultural gendered expectations (e.g., cross-dressing, androgyny).703. Gender status assertion: Articulating one own sense of gender kindmembership (e.g., ‘I am nonbinary’, ‘I am genderfluid’).4. Queering personal relationships: Fluidity between or violation of tra-ditional gender roles within personal relationships (e.g., taking on certaintraditional female parenting roles as well as male roles, gender play insexual relationships).71 725. Defying sexual binary: Identifying one’s sexuality outside of the ‘gay’,‘straight’, or ‘bisexual’ taxonomy, which is based on a binary gender sys-tem.7368This approach, I think, nicely aligns with genderqueers persons shared sense of ignoringand/or breaking gender rules. As one genderqueer person comments in “Gender Can Be BothLiberating And Stifling At The Same Time” (2018): “I’m what people would be if genderrules didn’t really exist.”69And similarly for other gender neutral language–e.g., ‘Mx.’ over ’Mr.’ or ’Ms.’, ‘parent’over ‘mother’ or ‘father’, or using a chosen, gender ambiguous name over one’s birth name. Theimportance of generating gender neutral language in the service of breaking down the binaryassumption cannot, I think, be understated, given the close relationship between language andavailable concepts. See, e.g., Wittig (1992), 55: “We must produce a political transformationof the key concepts, that is of the concepts which are strategic for us. For there is anotherorder of materiality, that of language, and language is worked upon from within by thesestrategic concepts.”70Transgressive gender aesthetics are a long standing tradition of queering gender. MarjorieGarber (1992), for example, discusses transvestism as a way to not only create a crisis notonly for the gender binary, but for the stability of gender categorization altogether.71Mo, a female-assigned genderqueer person describes this enactment of genderqueerness.“My feelings about my gender are not dependent on [how I am perceived],” they say, “butare more tied in to how I identify with people (men as much as women, and trans people ofall kinds) and how I relate to my family (as a husband and dad), etc.” Mo Interview (2018).(Mo’s last name has been omitted to maintain anonymity.)72Any queering of sexual relationships is typically met with the strongest negative reactionfrom dominant culture. According to Murray David (1983), this is because these genderviolations directly challenge others’ pervasive reliance on binary sexual norms to organizetheir lives. Cited in Bornstein (1994), 72.73Nagoshi, et al. (2012) provides qualitative empirical data concerning the close relationshipbetween gender and sexual identities. At one genderqueer participant, AJ, reported, “I identifyas queer as my sexual identity... I don’t really see that there really is a binary. So I wouldn’teven say bisexual, because that’s still acknowledging that there’s a binary system.” (217).For further empirical discussion, see Bradford, et al. (2018), p. 5. See also Dembroff (2016)for philosophical discussion on the relationship between gender and sexual identity.226. Space switching: Fluidity between female and male coded spaces insituations with no gender neutral alternative (e.g. using both men’s andwomen’s bathrooms, moving between male and female friend groups).74This list is by no means exhaustive of the many ways in which genderqueerpeople manifest resistance to being held captive within the gender binary.75 Mypurpose is not to provide an exhaustive list of ways to be genderqueer, butrather to illustrate the multifarious nature of genderqueer. While some of theseenactments (e.g. assertion) will be easily interpretable by other persons, some(e.g., gender non-conformity) will not. Moreover, genderqueers will not use thesame or perhaps any of these enactments at all times or spaces. Someone whouses gender-neutral pronouns with friends may not do so at work. Someone whowill assert a genderqueer identity in explicitly trans-inclusive groups may not doso outside of these groups. Genderqueers enact their identity in multitude waysbecause being genderqueer is not about creating and obeying a new set of gendernorms: it is about throwing out gender norms. That is: genderqueer is notabout maintaining a grey, androgynous middle ground between ‘masculine’ and‘feminine’, ‘man’ and ‘woman’, but rather resisting the command to accept thesebinary concepts as the concepts by which one must be identified, labeled, andevaluated. This point is further reinforced by qualitative empirical research ongenderqueer identities. Bradford et al (2018) notes that while models of gendertypically expected gender to be stable and predictable, “having the agency tomake decisions regarding one’s body and identity may be an integral componentof genderqueer identity development” – one that often results in a “process ofexperimentation.”76Here, two key upshots of the proposed view comes into focus. First, beinggenderqueer is context sensitive.77 Because genderqueer, on my proposal, in-cludes personal resistance to the binary assumption, it is largely constrainedto contexts where Western gender ideology is dominant.78 This is not to pre-clude that there may be a closely related kind–one whose members challenge–personally or not–the binary assumption. Such a category would unify gen-derqueer with the variety of genders beyond male and female recognized in othersocieties, such as Indonesia’s waria, Native American two-spirit, and Samoan74Like all of the above, space switching is a way of breaking and also fluidly navigating binarygender rules. “[Fluidity across gender rules generates] the ability to freely and knowinglybecome one or many of a limitless number of gender for any length of time, at any rate ofchange. Gender fluidity recognises no borders or rules of gender.” (Bornstein (1994), 52.)75For empirical data on the various strategies toward genderqueer expression, see Richardet al. (2016).76Bradford (2018), 8.77As stated, the proposal also leaves open the possibility of being genderqueer to differentdegrees. While I’m open to this possibility, I will set it aside, as I think a framework thatpronounces who is more (or less) genderqueer would not be productive.78With perhaps a few exceptions: it seems possible that an individual who is from a Westerncontext might travel to a context where the binary assumption is not part of the dominantgender ideology, and yet retain their intentional resistance to that assumption. It also seemspossible that someone outside of a Western context might nevertheless have exposure to andso adopt a genderqueer identity. I do not have strong views about these borderline cases.23fa’afafine.79Second, being genderqueer, on my proposal, requires that an individualmust–to some extent and in some context–manifest personal resistance to the bi-nary assumption.80 No doubt, some will find this result unpalatable, for reasonsdiscussed in §3.2. Many people prefer to think of being genderqueer as some-thing that is wholly internal, such that someone could be entirely closeted andremain genderqueer. This internalized approach is reified by common narrativesof ‘discovering’ or ‘realizing’ that one is genderqueer, as opposed to ‘choosingto be’ or ‘becoming’ genderqueer. At the same time, these narratives are coun-terbalanced by other, also common narratives such as, “I [finally] get to be whoI want to be,” or “I... try to get to a place where I can safely be myself.”81One might worry that my account precludes those in hostile environments withheavy costs of defying gender rules from being genderqueer.In response, I first want to emphasize that, on my proposal, manifestingresistance is multiply realizable and not based on others’ reactions or inter-pretations. There are myriad ways that someone could manifest resistance tothe gender binary without incurring heavy social costs, even in hostile envi-ronments. While pronoun pins, cultivating androgyny, or bare assertion areall clear potential ways of resisting the binary assumption, nothing so loud isrequired on my proposal, which emphasizes self-perception over others’ percep-tions. As one agender person put this, “[S]ometimes when we dress ourselves,or when we find...moments of authenticity, they are acts of resistance even whenthey’re small.”82 My proposal leaves these ‘small acts of resistance’ open to gen-derqueer persons, and does not require social uptake of any given individual’sacts of resistance.83That said, it is at least possible that social costs could prevent someone fromenacting resistance to the binary in any way. Where I diverge, though, is in theinterpretation of this situation: the standard reading says that someone is ‘truly’genderqueer, and unjustly prevented from self-expression. In contrast, I read thesituation as one in which someone is unjustly prevented from being genderqueer.Referring to someone as a ‘closeted’ genderqueer–rather than someone who isforced into binary classification against their wishes–downplays both the powerof social forces over our access to social identities as well as how oppressive79This feature of my proposal allows us to compare critical gender kinds in a given contextwith gender kinds across contexts. This is important, as it gives us a framework for interpretingcommon claims about the universality of nonbinary and trans identities. For example, if weinterpret ‘trans’, in such a claim, as anyone whose existence challenges the genital assumption,then we can look for any time or society to identify such persons. If we interpret it asconcerning existential personal resistance to the genital assumption, then our search will beconstrained to a contexts where this assumption is dominant.80My proposal might, in this sense, be thought in the spirit of Butler’s (1997) ‘symbolicinteractionism’, or the idea that an individual’s gender is created an sustained through “re-flecting back images of the self as objects.” Hird (2012), 585.81“Gender Can Be Both Liberating And Stifling At The Same Time” (2018), Brehob (2018).82“Gender Can Be Both Liberating And Stifling At The Same Time” (2018)83That said, given the political nature of this category, some degree of social uptake of itsmembers’ collective resistant actions does seem required for the category’s existence.24that power can be.84 Someone who is forced to follow all the gender rulesout of fear is, by my lights, prevented by an unjust social system from beinggenderqueer–the cost of ideological resistance is untenable. This is not merelya stifling of self-expression, but a stifling of self-realization: if genderqueer iscentrally about ideological resistance, oppressive social factors have the potentialto prevent its realization. In contexts where someone who wants to resist binaryclassification faces with untenable costs of doing so, the central injustice of isnot, I think, a lack of recognition. Rather, it is a lack of autonomy over one’sgender classification. Emily Brehob, who identifies as intersex and nonbinary,describes being caught in such a situation:Now that I live in Texas, I find it more difficult to walk the line ofaffirming my identity to myself while remaining safe. I find myselfreverting to the mean: growing my hair long, letting it slide whenpeople call me a woman... Is my identity even real if I don’t expressit? ... There something incredibly powerful–revolutionary, even–about challenging someone’s understanding of gender with your veryexistence.85Understanding genderqueer as a critical gender kind whose members man-ifest existential resistance to the binary assumption helps us understand theexperiences of persons like Brehob. Being genderqueer is not simply in thehead: it challenges dominant gender ideology ‘with one’s very existence’. Tounderstand this gender kind, we needed a new model–one that captures the in-terplay between ideological resistance and gender identification. I’ve proposedone such model, and no doubt there are others. But if one thing is clear, itis that if we are to understand this cultural revolution, we need new concepts,new language, and new metaphysics. Armed with these tools, we can join RikiWilchins in wondering if we are “unconsciously and finally treading towards theend of gender categories as we know them.”86 Either way, I agree with Wilchins:“It will be fun finding out.”87 885 BibliographyAizura, A.

    "abstract": "We want to know what gender is. But approaches to\\ud\nthis question solely have focused on the binary gender kinds men and\\ud\nwomen. By overlooking those who identify outside of the binary -- the\\ud\ngroup I call `genderqueer' -- we are left without tools for understanding these new and quickly growing gender identifications. This metaphysical gap in turn creates a conceptual lacuna that contributes to systematic misunderstanding of genderqueer persons. In this paper, I argue that to better understand genderqueer identities, we must recognize a new type of gender kind: critical gender kinds, or kinds whose members resist dominant gender ideology. After developing a model of critical gender kinds, I suggest that genderqueer is best modeled as one such kind. In particular, I propose that its members are united by resisting `the binary assumption', or the prevalent assumption that they must comply with binary gender classification",
