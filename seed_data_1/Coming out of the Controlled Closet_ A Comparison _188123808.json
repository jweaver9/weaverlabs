The information needs and information seeking behaviors of the LGBT \ncommunity can be complicated by various institutional oppressions such as homophobia, \ndecreased visibility, and lack of information (Antell, Strothmann, & Downey, 2013; Chapman & \nBirdi, 2016; Hughes-Hassell, Overberg, & Harris, 2013; Stenback & Schrader, 1999). But if a \nlibrary does have the information, how do people search for information regarding LGBT topics? \nDo their search terms, such as those used during a keyword search in a library Online Public \nAccess Catalog (OPAC) or discovery layer, match any controlled vocabularies? Of course, these \nquestions are near impossible to answer. After all, not every person in the LGBT community \nuses the same language or terminology for how they experience sexual attraction and gender \nidentity, and the language currently en vogue can change without warning, suddenly rendering \nold language at best obsolete and at worst offensive or oppressive. \nThis old language, if solidified in controlled vocabulary, remains in use long after the \ncommunity deems it harmful or incorrect. Often, librarians add language without consulting the \ncommunity it represents. Many librarians have been analyzing and critiquing controlled \nvocabularies, particularly the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), since the 1970s. \nYet despite the many suggestions of better language, these suggestions, to the best of the \nresearcher’s knowledge, have little basis in or are rarely based on empirical research. \n2 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nThe aim of this study is to provide a comparison of Library of Congress Subject \nHeadings and natural search language involving LGBT topics. The hypothesis is that there are \ndifferences, especially relating to topics that fall under the less stable “queer” identity. By \nillustrating any differences or similarities, as well as demonstrating a methodology and results, \nthis research provides a better foundation for librarians wanting to update, remove, and/or add \nnew language to controlled vocabularies. The findings of this study should empower librarians \nand patrons alike and to inspire action within our profession. \nLiterature Review \n Since 1971, librarians have been attempting to correct the harmful and outdated Library \nof Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) relating to people, particularly the LGBT community. \nThese early critiques focus mainly on homosexuality and the specific identities related. For \ninstance, Sanford Berman critiques the cross-reference of Homosexuality and Lesbianism to \nSexual perversion in his book Prejudices and Antipathies: A Tract on the LC Subject Heads \nConcerning People (1971). After Berman, librarians continue to critique and attempt to correct \nboth Library of Congress subject headings and classification that relate to the LGBT community, \nas well as other controlled vocabularies, and how they are assigned (Carmichael, 1998, 2002; \nChristensen, 2008; Greenblatt, 1990; McClary & Howard, 2007). \n It is not until almost a decade into the twenty-first century that these analyses are turned \ntoward trans identities and identities which are not lesbian or gay. And because of the fluid \nnature of identity labels, many of these analyses compare Library of Congress subject headings \nand other controlled vocabularies to non-traditional forms of subject access, such as \nLibraryThing folksonomies (Adler, 2009; Angell & Roberto, 2014; Bates & Rowley, 2011; \nJohnson, 2010). These studies investigate the how users describe materials which involve trans \n3 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nand queer subjects, as well as the history of transgender subject access. Often, folksonomies \ncapture the nuance and fluidity of queer language while controlled vocabularies cement outdated \nterminology. \n However, the articles and books cited above do not cite that they took patron language \ninto account when creating new terms or critiquing old terms. \nMethodology \nA qualitative methods approach was employed for this research. Data were collected \nthrough a series of one-on-one semi-structured interviews with faculty/professors in Gender and \nWomen’s Studies at the University of Illinois. Although the researcher sent out multiple \nrecruitment emails for research participants, only four professors responded to the request. This \nsmall sample size does not and should not reflect a general patron base, especially considering \nthese participants knew a library school student was conducting the interview. The IRB at the \nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign approved this research. These interviews contained \nat least 10 questions and lasted approximately 30 to 60 minutes each; because the interviews \nwere semi-structured, the researcher asked further questions based on the responses given by \nparticipants. Questions were designed to examine the language that participants used to search \nfor concepts, with semiotics and post-structural critical theories serving as a framework. Their \nanswers answered the first research question: What language do patrons use when searching for \nLGBTQ topics? \nThe researcher then analyzed the answers of the research participants to find the specific \nterms used for searching. Data were analyzed through transcription and coding, and that coding \nwas compared to existing Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) through both a subject \nheading search and a keyword search and Library of Congress Demographic Group Terms \n4 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \n(LCDGT) through a keyword search; the reason for not also doing a subject heading search for \nLCDGT was that hundreds of unrelated terms would come up. These searches were done in \nClassification Web.  \nThe researcher chose a qualitative approach for this study because this research deals \nwith concepts and wording rather than numerical data. It also allows for this data to be framed \nwithin a context focusing on participants’ lived experiences and letting them describe themselves \nin their own words, rather than privileging the data as empirical fact regardless of context \n(Creswell, 2014; FIRESTONE, 1987). For a more detailed look into the methodology, see the \nauthor’s article in In the Library with the Lead Pipe (Colbert, 2017). \nResults \nThrough four semi-structured interviews, data were gathered about the demographics, \nsearching habits, search terms, and relevancy of search results from Gender and Women’s \nStudies professors at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. These interviews were \nrecorded, then transcribed and coded. However, the audio of the interview conducted with \nresearch participant 2 was not loud enough to transcribe and code, and any reference to that \ninterview comes from memory. Research participants are labeled using P for participant and a \nnumber indicating the order in which they were interviewed. \nThe data gathered from these interviews show the variety of language used when doing \nresearch on LGBT topics, as well as the variety of searching habits of research participants. As \nthe results show, these professors rarely use the online public access catalog of the library and \ninstead begin their research in other venues. \nAnd despite the difference shown between their language and the language used by the \nLibrary of Congress, research participants stated that they often find what they are looking for. \n5 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nAlthough they might not find information during their first search, their skills and experience as \nresearchers allow them to alter their search strategies to eventually find resources. Novice \nresearchers might not yet have this skill set, and thus it is still important to investigate the \nlanguage used in controlled vocabularies. \nDemographics \nEach research participant was asked their sexuality, gender, race, and socioeconomic \nstatus. These demographics can influence not only the language participants use to search, but \nalso their search habits and experience. Of the four research participants, only one identified as \nstraight, with the other three identifying as some sort of woman-loving-women identity such as \nlesbian. All four participants identified as women. Two participants identified as white, with one \nidentifying with her Latina ethnicity and one identifying as Asian American. All four identified \ntheir socioeconomic status somewhere within the middle class, with one saying that she felt she \nbelonged somewhere between working class and middle class due to her upbringing and the fact \nthat she must work more than one job, despite having a Ph.D. \nAll four participants are researchers and professors at the University of Illinois at Urbana-\nChampaign, either in Gender and Women’s Studies or in adjacent fields. They all have extensive \nresearch experience in their fields and can conduct searches with enough skill to find what they \nneed. \nSearch Habits \nAfter asking demographic questions, each research participant was asked how she \nidentifies an LGBT topic. Although each research participant gave different answers based on \nhow they situate themselves within the discourse, they all agreed that LGBT topics might not \nneed to necessarily be about the experiences and lives of LGBT people. LGBT topics, according \n6 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nto the research participants, can, in fact, be adjacent topics. P3 gave the example of hate crime \nstatistics. While hate crimes happen to other demographic groups, members of the LGBT \ncommunity could also be interested in those broad statistics because hate crimes also happen to \nthe LGBT community. \nThe researcher then asked the research participants where they begin their searches when \nsearching for what they consider an LGBT topic. None of the research participants start by going \nto the University of Illinois’ VuFind library catalog. Some participants start their searches by \ndoing background research, either through consulting bibliographies or works about the topic \n(P1, P4); they might even consult works broadly related to the topic they need to search, such as \nlooking at works about Oscar Wilde (P1). Research participants will also consult others in their \nfield or in the field they are searching to get an idea of who is writing in that field. P4 cited that \nshe relies heavily on the women’s studies librarian and the University’s other subject specialist \nlibraries to help get her started when researching a new topic. P3 also preferred databases such as \nGoogle Scholar and PubMed for her research and only went into the actual catalog to get \ndocuments from searches done in those other databases. \nIn fact, all research participants only approached the library catalog when they either had \nthe title, author, or recommended subject term for the search. The participant who cited using the \nlibrarians for help felt very comfortable using the catalog (P4), but she preferred going into the \nstacks physically when looking for print monographs and journals. She prefers this experience \nbecause she likes the serendipity of discovery that can come with browsing. In particular, she \nenjoys knowing that the books are “organized in a way that things are going to be next to each \nother,” which helps her to find books she did not even know existed (P4). The participant \nillustrates the relationship between subject access and classification and how subject access also \n7 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \naffects browsing. Because she knows that similar books are grouped together in categories, she \nknows that browsing is another viable search strategy that might get around any awkwardness \nand difficulty when searching in a database or online catalog. \n Research participants were then asked what their preferred search type was, and whether \nthey tended to do keyword or subject searches more often. Most said keyword, but for those who \nsaid subject, it is not clear if they knew that subject searches require knowledge of a controlled \nvocabulary. When research participants did not use a keyword search, they would use a known \nauthor or title search. This illustrates that participants again do not approach the catalog unless \nthey know what they are looking for and that in fact, they do the bulk of their research before \ngoing into the library catalog itself. \nSearch Terms \nAfter the search habit questions, the researcher asked questions designed to discover what \nterms research participants associate with specific topics when searching. Each participant \nanswered how they would search for six concepts that align with various demographic groups in \nthe LGBT community: men who are only attracted to men, women who are only attracted to \nwomen, people who are attracted to two or more genders, people who are attracted to any \ngender, people who do not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth, and a community \nof people who fit into any of these categories. \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \n \nTable of All Terms Used by Research Participants \n \nP\n4\n \nP\n3\n \nP\n2\n \nP\n1\n \n \nM\nen\n w\nh\no\n are o\nn\nly\n \nattracted\n to\n m\nen\n \nM\nL\nM\n \nG\nay\n m\nen\n \n \nG\nay\n \nQ\nu\neer \nL\nG\nB\nT\n \n \nH\no\nm\no\nsex\nu\nal \nQ\nu\neer \nG\nay\n \nF\nairy\n \nF\nag\n \nM\nen\n w\nh\no\n are o\nn\nly\n \nattracted\n to\n m\nen\n \nW\no\nm\nen\n w\nh\no\n are o\nn\nly\n \nattracted\n to\n w\no\nm\nen\n \nL\nesb\nian\n \nL\nesb\nian\n A\nN\nD\n Q\nu\neer \nL\nesb\nian\n \nL\nG\nB\nT\n \n \nL\nesb\nian\n \nT\nrib\na\nd\ne \nF\nem\nm\ne à\n fem\nm\ne \nW\no\nm\nen\n w\nh\no\n are o\nn\nly\n \nattracted\n to\n w\no\nm\nen\n \nP\neo\np\nle w\nh\no\n are attracted\n \nto\n tw\no\n o\nr m\no\nre g\nen\nd\ners \nB\nisex\nu\nal \nG\nen\nd\ner id\nen\ntity\n \nM\nu\nltip\nle g\nen\nd\ners \nB\nisex\nu\nal \nB\ni \nL\nG\nB\nT\n \n \nB\nisex\nu\nal \nP\nan\nsex\nu\nal \nP\neo\np\nle w\nh\no\n are attracted\n \nto\n tw\no\n o\nr m\no\nre g\nen\nd\ners \nP\neo\np\nle w\nh\no\n are attracted\n \nto\n tw\no\n o\nr m\no\nre g\nen\nd\ners \nT\nran\ns \nT\nran\ns*\n \nT\nran\nsg\nen\nd\ner \nP\nan\nsex\nu\nal \n \nB\nisex\nu\nal \nP\nan\nsex\nu\nal \nP\neo\np\nle w\nh\no\n are attracted\n \nto\n an\ny\n g\nen\nd\ner \n9 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nP\neo\np\nle w\nh\no\n d\no\n n\no\nt id\nen\ntify\n w\nith\n th\ne \ng\nen\nd\ner th\ney\n w\nere assig\nn\ned\n at b\nirth\n \nT\nran\nsg\nen\nd\ner \nT\nran\nsg\nen\nd\ner \n \nT\nran\nsg\nen\nd\ner \nT\nran\nssex\nu\nal \nP\neo\np\nle w\nh\no\n d\no\n n\no\nt id\nen\ntify\n w\nith\n th\ne \ng\nen\nd\ner th\ney\n w\nere assig\nn\ned\n at b\nirth\n \nL\nG\nB\nT\n \n“C\no\nm\nm\nu\nn\nity\n” w\nith\n lesb\nian\n, g\nay\n, \netc. \nQ\nu\neer C\no\nm\nm\nu\nn\nity\n \nS\nam\ne-sex\n \nF\nem\nm\ne \nB\nu\ntch\n \nA\nltern\nativ\ne sex\nu\nalities \nL\natin\nx\n \nL\nG\nB\nT\n \nL\nG\nB\nT\nQ\nIA\n \n \nL\nesb\nian\n \nG\nay\n \nB\nisex\nu\nal \nQ\nu\neer \nT\nh\ne Q\nu\neer C\no\nm\nm\nu\nn\nity\n \nL\nG\nB\nT\nQ\n \nL\nG\nB\nT\n \nA\n co\nm\nm\nu\nn\nity\n o\nf p\neo\np\nle w\nh\no\n fit \nin\nto\n an\ny\n o\nf th\nese categ\no\nries \nTable 1 \n \nFor men who are only attracted to men, all participants use some sort of variation on the \nterm gay, whether gay by itself or gay men. Most participants viewed the term gay as an \numbrella term (even if they did not agree with that) and thought that starting broader is usually \nbetter. Unless participants were doing medical or otherwise historical research, they did not use \nthe term homosexual due to its history as a way to medicalize gays and lesbians. One research \nparticipant also cited that she would probably try the phrase “men who love men” and its \nvariations (such as the acronym mlm) as a keyword search. \nFor women who are only attracted to women, all participants use lesbian and might use \nother terms depending on their discipline. One participant cited that she also uses foreign \nlanguage terms like femme à femme due to the nature of her research (P1). Research participants \n10 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nnoted that lesbian is somehow more specific than gay or gay men because of the umbrella effect \nof the term gay. One research participant also noted that she feels that more works exist on the \nsubject of lesbianism and the lesbian experience, that women are more likely to “get to know \n[themselves] through writing…[and] have been more apt to write about [their experience] as a \nway of resistance” (P4). As the comparison of terms will show, while this assumption might be \ncorrect, more subject and demographic terms exist for gay and gay men, probably because those \nterms seem to act as an umbrella while also referring to a specific form of homosexual attraction. \n While most participants could expand on the reason for their search terms for the first \ntwo concepts and felt confident in those terms, the rest of the terms produced very \nstraightforward answers, even if those answers were uncertain. One possible reason for this is the \nfact that questions forced participants to think of terms they would use to search for both the \nattraction to multiple genders and the attraction to any gender. All participants cited the \nlimitations of the term bisexual and how they feel it upholds our Western gender binary and that \nthey would also use the term pansexual for searching. Most participants would use both terms for \nboth types of multi-gender attraction to make sure they do the most comprehensive search \npossible. \n Participants also shared the same search term for people who do not identify with the \ngender they were assigned at birth but expressed concern that they knew it would probably be the \nonly term that would garner any results. For this concept, participants use the term transgender \nand only use transsexual if they are looking for materials on the specific act of medical \ntransition. However, participants worried that transgender would not cover all ways of not \nconforming to gender and sometimes would also use abbreviations like trans and trans* and \n11 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nterms like femme, butch, and boi. One participant also stated that she might search the term \nLatinx which is a gender-neutral term specific to the Latino/Latina community and studies. \n Finally, participants answered how they would search for a community of people who fall \ninto these categories. Many participants would actually repeat language from other searches but \nwith “community” attached in addition to searching for common community terms like LGBT, \nLGBTQ, and queer. As the comparison will show, none of these common community terms exist \nin the Library of Congress controlled vocabularies. \nVery rarely did research participants cite only one term they would use for these \nconcepts, and if they did, they would explain how frustrating that was. Participants also cited that \nthe language they would use to search for any of these concepts would change depending on the \nnature of their research and disciplines. This way of searching poses a problem where controlled \nvocabularies are concerned, as there should only be one controlled term for all ways of referring \nto a subject. Most participants used multiple terms when doing keyword searches, especially in \ndatabases, and these can be successful if that language appears in the item records. By using \nmultiple terms when doing keyword searches, it is more likely that terminology used by research \nparticipants is also used by the Library of Congress. The next section will discuss this \ncomparison between research participant terminology and Library of Congress terminology. \nComparison of Terms to Library of Congress Subject Headings \n After interviews were completed, the researcher transcribed each interview and coded \nthat interview using in vivo coding, which privileges the language used by research participants \nand allows the researcher to analyze that language. Coding the interviews pulled out the most \ncommon terms used for each of the language questions which could then be used for searches \nwithin the Classification Web system; the researched used this system as opposed to \n12 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nauthorities.loc.gov because it allows more ways of searching and allows the user to search \nspecifically for demographic group terms.  \n First, the researcher took the terms gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, transgender, \ntranssexual, queer, and LGBT and searched the Library of Congress Subject Headings. \nClassification Web allows the user to search for subject headings (a left-aligned search) and \nkeywords, as well as other types of subject headings. Each term was searched as a subject \nheading and then as a keyword. The subject heading results are left-aligned and alphabetical and \nonly include headings with the search term at the beginning of the heading. Subject heading \nsearches also include cross listings and Use Fors, which are not headings in and of themselves. \nKeyword heading results are expanded to show Use For headings and other cross listings and \nshow headings that have the search term elsewhere in the heading, even if it is not the first word \nof the heading. Keyword searches also include cross listings and Use Fors, like subject heading \nsearches. \n The search term gay gives 381 results as a subject heading search and 456 results as a \nkeyword search. These headings include the demographic terms (discussed below) but also \ninclude headings such as Gay accommodations and Gay detectives. It also includes the heading \nGays as well as Gay men. The search term lesbian gives 175 results as a subject heading search \nand 180 results as a keyword search. These headings include the demographic terms (discussed \nbelow) but also include headings such as Lesbian librarians and Lesbian separatism. \n The search term bisexual gives 48 results as a subject heading search and 47 results as a \nkeyword search. The search term pansexual gives 0 results for both kinds of searches. The results \nfor bisexual include demographic terms (discussed below) but also terms like Bisexual college \nstudents. The Library of Congress does not include any terms for the word pansexual, nor do any \n13 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nheadings redirect from it as a Use For. The search term transgender gives 46 results as a subject \nheading search and 48 results as a keyword search. The search term transsexual gives 30 results \nas a subject heading search and 28 results as a keyword search. The results include demographic \nterms (discussed below) as well as other terms. \n The search term queer gives 3 results as a subject heading search and 5 results as a \nkeyword search. These results do not include demographic group terms but do include the \nheading Queer theory. The search term LGBT gives 7 results as a subject heading search and 6 \nresults as a keyword search. These results include demographic group terms and other headings, \nbut most of these are cross listings. \n \nFigure 1 \nThe second search type was a demographic group term search. Library of Congress \nDemographic Group Terms (LCDGT) are subject headings, but Classification Web allows users \nto search for them separately. Demographic group terms act as broad terms for an entire \n381\n175\n48\n0\n46\n30\n3 7\n456\n180\n47\n0\n48\n28\n5 6\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\nGay Lesbian Bisexual Pansexual Transgender Transsexual Queer LGBT\nNumber of Library of Congress Subject Headings Matching \nInterviewee Keywords\nLCSH Subject Search LCSH Keyword Search\n14 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \ndemographic of people. For the search, the researcher only did a keyword search; this is because \na subject heading search includes hundreds of unrelated headings for each term. \nThe search term gay gives 6 results. These results include the terms Gays and Gay men, \nas well as other terms like Conversion therapy patients. There are no scope notes for the \nheadings Gays and Gay men to dictate how they are different or how they should be assigned. \nThe search term lesbian only gives 1 result, the subject heading Lesbians. The search term \nbisexual also only gives 1 result, the subject heading Bisexuals. Pansexual gives 0 results. The \nsearch term transgender gives 2 results, and the search term transsexual gives 1 result. Like with \nGays and Gay men, there are no scope notes for these headings to dictate how they are different \nor how they should be assigned. The search term queer gives 0 results, while the search term \nLGBT gives 2 results. The results for LGBT do not include LGBT in the actual heading but \ninstead are the cross listed headings Gender minorities and Sexual minorities. \nThese comparisons illustrate not only the difference between common language for these \nterms but also the lack of authority control and equity between terms. Headings about gay men \nvastly outnumber headings about any other demographic, even though research participants gave \nseveral terms for each question asked. There exists just as much variety and nuance when \nspeaking about issues of gender identity as when speaking about the issues of gay men. \n15 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \n \nFigure 2 \nRelevancy of Searches and Subject Headings \nAfter asking for the search terms that participants use for these concepts, the final \nquestions were about the relevancy of search results and the familiarity the participants had with \nsubject headings. Despite the discrepancy in some search terms to subject headings, participants \ngenerally felt satisfied with the results of their searches. If participants were unsatisfied, it was \nlargely due to research and writings on LGBT topics not existing in their disciplines, or the \nsearch terms they used were too discipline-specific when doing a subject search (but not a \nkeyword search). Rarely did participants not find anything or get zero search results; if this did \nhappen, it was again largely due to trends within their disciplines and not the search terms. \nResearch participants also cited not being frustrated because they are experienced-enough \nresearchers to know that you do not find what you need right away and that searching is a deeply \ninvolved process that includes consulting materials outside of catalog and database searches. \nDiscussion \n6\n1 1\n0\n2\n1\n0\n2\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nGay Lesbian Bisexual Pansexual Transgender Transsexual Queer LGBT\nNumber of Library of Congress Demographic Group Terms \nMatching Interviewee Keywords\nLCDGT Keyword Search\n16 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nThe results of the research show that a discrepancy exists between the language people \nuse when searching for various LGBT topics and the language used by the Library of Congress \nto control subject access to these topics. As discussed in Hope A. Olson’s seminal work The \nPower to Name (2002), cataloging librarians quite literally control how patrons access materials \nthrough the language we use to control subject access. Not only does this limit subject access by \nforcing patrons to use certain language in order to find materials, but it also reflects how the \nLibrary of Congress and librarians view these subjects. If there are no headings or cross listed \nheadings for the identity pansexual, then what does that say about how the Library of Congress \nviews works created about this identity? Is this body of research not important or valid enough \nfor literary warrant? \nThe results also show that, while many headings exist for most of these terms and \nidentities, scope notes are not in place to dictate how they should be assigned. This poses a \nproblem for subject access, particularly terms with complicated histories and nuance: if no scope \nnotes are provided, how are librarians supposed to know how to assign them correctly? A bigger \nproblem exists with the headings and demographic terms Gays and Gay men, as these also do not \ninclude scope notes for usage. Are librarians supposed to know that Gays is an umbrella term? \nDoes the Library of Congress even consider it an umbrella term? What exactly is it an umbrella \nterm for? Is it only for homosexual identities such as lesbian and gay? When there is no \ninstruction for usage or definition, redundancies in subject access occur, as well as inaccurate \nsubject analysis. One purpose of subject analysis is collocation of similar materials for shelf \nbrowsing as well as subject access in online catalogs. With the confusion between these \nsomewhat similar terms, materials may not be in the correct place on the shelf, which limits \naccess and item-level findability. \n17 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nAnother variance found in the data is the difference in terms for the community. All \nparticipants would use some variation of the LGBT acronym as a search term for the community; \nhowever, no demographic group term exists using any variation of that acronym. The only terms \nthat do use a variation of the acronym are terms such as LGBT History Month. Not even LGBT \npride events are controlled using that language. Instead, there is a heading for Gay pride and \nsimilar events. The acronym has been in use for years and is generally well-known in the United \nStates. There should be no reason that it is not used as a demographic group term for the \ncommunity. Instead, the main community terms in LCSH are Sexual minorities and Gender \nminorities, which conflate minority status with marginalization. \nThe Problem with Queer \nThe final discrepancy between the language used by research participants and the \nlanguage used by the Library of Congress is the use of the term queer. Queer is a tricky word \neven within the LGBT community. Originally a slur, queer was reclaimed by the community as a \nword of power and as a way to protest assimilation politics of mainstream gay rights \norganizations. Queer also goes against and challenges binary ways of understanding gender and \nsexuality. Queer refuses to be pinned down, refuses to be controlled, and refuses to be defined. \nEven if one experiences their gender and sexuality in a “straightforward” way, one can still use \nqueer to signal that that is socially constructed, to recognize that sexuality is fluid. Queer can \nrefer to sexual attraction and/or gender identity. No two people will use the term in the same \nway, and that is precisely the beauty of it. \nThis refusal to be controlled is exactly what poses a problem for subject access. If queer \ncannot be defined in a specific way, then by definition it is impossible for it to be part of a \ncontrolled vocabulary. If the Library of Congress were to create a subject heading for a queer \n18 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nidentity, to what would it refer? Would we need two headings, one for a queer gender identity \nand one for a queer sexual preference? But again, no two people who identify as queer in either \ntheir gender or sexuality experience that in the same way. Of course, no two people ever \nexperience sexuality or gender in exactly the same way, but identity labels such as lesbian and \ntransgender describe broadly a shared experience by people in a community. \nBut people are searching using queer and are expecting to find materials that describe a \nqueer experience. So what are librarians to do? Queer goes against our entire way of thinking \nabout controlled vocabularies and subject access (Drabinski, 2013). If we are to create subject \naccess for queer, then we necessarily must rethink and reframe all subject access. Queer is fluid \nin that it is socially constructed and is fluid in history because of that social construction. Queer \nwill not mean the same thing in a decade. If we have it as a heading, will we then need to change \nits scope note and usage as the language changes? Is this something we should be doing with \nheadings already? \nImplications of Research \nThe results of this study have implications for various aspects of librarianship, both \ntechnical services and public services. When working with LGBT patrons or collections, \nlibrarians should be aware of how subject headings, online catalogs, and reference interviews \nfunction with other systems in the library. This research shows that these systems need to take \nthe information needs and information seeking behavior of all patron types into account when \ncreating them. \nLimitations \n The researcher not search each term used by each participant because some terms, such \nas the foreign language terms used by research Participant 1, are discipline-specific. Although \n19 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nthe small sample size cannot represent a general population, this research aims to highlight terms \nthat are most common within the LGBT community and those that would be used by those not \nwithin the community. For example, when performing searches using variants of the LGBT \nacronym, the same results were returned. \nConclusion \nTo conclude, more research into this area is required to get a better idea of how the \nlanguage used by patrons differs from Library of Congress Subject Headings, and how that \nlanguage difference affects search results. As the results show, even a small sample of research \nparticipants have differing language for the same concepts, but that differing language does not \naffect their search effectiveness. Even with their research success, librarians should be centering \nthe experience of patrons when doing subject authority work, as not every patron has the \nresearch experience to know how and when to alter their search strategies. \nOne complication of the research is that the language used by the LGBT community to \ndescribe itself changes and often refuses to hold one solid definition. For example, the term \nqueer by definition cannot be controlled and exists in a tense conflict with controlled vocabulary. \nSubject access should therefore not just include Library of Congress Subject Headings but \nshould also consider other forms of access, such as local headings or tagging systems. \nFurther research done should include different methods and demographic groups to get a \nbroader sample of language. It could also focus on other areas of librarianship and subjects, such \nas collection development and how it affects communities of color. This research should be used \nto support and influence changes made in LCSH. \n  \n20 \nCOMING OUT OF THE CONTROLLED CLOSET \nReferences \nAdler, M. (2009).

    "abstract": "Subject access to homosexuality and other LGBT topics has a complicated history. Because language used for concepts can change depending on who you ask, controlling this vocabulary is a difficult task. The aim of this research is to show a discrepancy between keyword searches and Library of Congress Subject Headings when searching for queer topics, as well as to encourage other librarians to perform research in this area when updating or adding new subject headings. The results of this study show that differences in language do exist but mainly for concepts with difficult or multiple meanings or when doing searches from different disciplines",
