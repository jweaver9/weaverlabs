DOCUMENTING DIVERSITY: THE EXPERIENCES OF LGBTQ+ DOCTORAL RESEARCHERS IN THE UK Ross English University of  Brighton,  Brighton, UK R.English@brighton.ac.uk  Kieran Fenby-Hulse* Coventry University,  Coventry, UK  Kieran.Fenby-Hulse@coventry.ac.uk  * Corresponding author ABSTRACT Aim/Purpose This article provides a much needed insight into the experiences of  doctoral researchers in the UK that identify as Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Trans-, Queer, or outside of  heteronormative or cis-normative identities (LGBTQ+) to address the question of  what support, culture, and pedagogy might better support doc-toral researchers who identify as LGBTQ+. Background While experiences of  LGBTQ+ students in UK Higher Education have been explored in recent studies, the experiences of  doctoral students have not been differentiated, documented, or analyzed. Methodology Through an online questionnaire sent to UK institutions, this study captures and reflects on the diverse experiences of  doctoral education. The study took a predominantly phenomenological approach, placing the focus on understanding how individual researchers experienced their working environment. Contribution This questionnaire offers a ‘campus climate’ study, providing a much-needed insight into the experiences of  doctoral researchers in the UK in 2017. The study also highlights the importance of  acknowledging the diversity of  doctoral researchers and adapting supervisory and institutional support to meet the dif-fering needs of  doctoral researchers. It considers themes such as the impact of  the working environment, experiences of  macroaggressions and harassment, the need for researchers to work internationally, and the visibility of  role mod-els. The complex nature of  the supervisor-student relationship is also consid-ered throughout. Findings Although many LGBTQ+ doctoral students felt they were studying in a sup-portive institution, the questionnaire highlights a diverse range of  inclusivity issues as well as direct instances of  homophobic and/or transphobic behavior. Documenting Diversity 404 Recommendations  for Practitioners From this questionnaire, it is concluded that there is a need for a critical exami-nation of  systems and spaces in which doctoral education takes place and the implementation of  systems and spaces that are inclusive. There is a need for all those involved in doctoral education to understand how identifying as a LGBTQ+ researcher can impact on your experience of  doctoral education. And, finally, there is a need for better LGBTQ+ visibility, better representation, and better mentoring. Recommendations  for Researchers  If  doctoral education is to meet the needs of  an increasingly diverse workforce, research needs to take into account the views and experiences of  minority and marginalized groups that may challenge or be in tension with the views of  the larger research population. Impact on Society As the demographic of  the doctoral researcher population diversifies, it is in-creasingly important that our approach to doctoral education and the systems and processes that underpin doctoral education are adapted to meet the needs of  that diverse population. Future Research There is potential scope for future studies to focus specifically on issues of  in-tersectionality, disciplinary differences, health and wellbeing, representation, voice, and agency, as well as productivity, attainment, and career development of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers. Keywords LGBTQ+, supervision, doctoral education, postgraduate research, equality, di-versity, inclusion INTRODUCTION This article provides a much needed insight into the experiences of  doctoral researchers in the UK that identify as Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Trans-, Queer, or outside of  heteronormative or cis-normative identities. While experiences of  Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transsexual and Queer (LGBTQ+) students in UK Higher Education have been explored in recent studies, the experiences of  doctoral students have not been differentiated. Surveys and questionnaires of  LGBTQ+ students have either treated undergraduates and postgraduates as a single body or, where mention has been made of  a distinct postgraduate experience, the references has been fleeting and have not distin-guished between postgraduate taught students and those studying for a doctoral degree (Ellis, 2009; Equality Challenge Unit [ECU], 2009; Mckendry & Lawrence, 2017; National Union of  Students [NUS], 2015). Given the unique character of  doctoral study, encompassing the often complex and close relationship between supervisor and student (Johnson, Lee, & Green, 2000) and the transitional nature of  the doctoral journey in terms of  identity and personal and professional development (Baker & Pifer, 2011; McAlpine & Amundsen, 2009) there is certainly a need to better understand the experiences of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers and to determine whether there are distinct challenges that some LGBTQ+ researchers may face. LITERATURE REVIEW EXPERIENCES OF LGBTQ+ DOCTORAL RESEARCHERS There has been no study, to date, that provides a detailed insight into the experiences of  the doctoral researchers that identify as LGBTQ+. For this study, an iterative literature review that drew on Eng-lish-language research from across the social sciences and humanities disciplines was undertaken. Both discipline-based and generic search tools to identify relevant literature were used. This included keyword combination searches of  relevant terms (LGBTQ+, LGB*, Queer, Higher Education, Academ*, Postgraduate Researcher, PGR, Doctora*, PhD, diversity, and inclusion) in the databases: Academic Search Complete, ASSIA (Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts), ProQuest Educa-English & Fenby-Hulse 405 tion Database, as well as searching Google Scholar, Google Books and our Library Search Engines to expand the disciplinary limits of  our literature review. In addition, the UK Council for Graduate Ed-ucation’s (UKCGE) extensive Research Supervisor’s Bibliography (Taylor, 2018) was consulted, which con-tains sections dedicated to social class, gender, ethnicity/race, age, disability, indigeneity, and sexuality. The bibliographies and cited works of  the articles were also used to identify other significant studies and/or scholars working in this, or related, areas. The aim was not to undertake a systematic literature review, but to identify key research themes across a broad range of  literature that would help locate and contextualize this project.  Within UKCGE’s aforementioned bibliography, four studies are included in the section on sexuality, with no studies addressing specifically trans-, and non-binary identities within doctoral education. Each of  the four studies cited, however, only address sexuality briefly. Lovitt’s work, which explores the varied reasons doctoral researchers leave academia, contains a single paragraph on sexuality that suggests discrimination based on sexual orientation may be connected to non-completion (Lovitt, 2001). Ostrove, Stewart and Curtin’s article on social class and doctoral study (2011) is similarly brief  in terms of  its discussion of  sexuality. Although the authors stress the importance of  identity and a sense of  belonging to doctoral study, they do not go into any detail on how this may impact on LGBTQ+ researchers. Wakeling’s (2010) report on widening participation initiatives for UK under-graduate and postgraduate degrees highlights the lack of  research in this area, drawing attention to the few all-encompassing studies of  LGBTQ+ students on campus (discussed in more detail below). Finally, the work of  Goody and de Vries (2002) focuses on discrimination in the workplace and how this can be addressed through inclusion and diversity initiatives. The article, though, does not give focus to how these initiatives might relate to doctoral researchers and doctoral study and so does not give us a picture of  the experiences, challenges, needs and wants of  the LGBTQ+ doctoral popula-tion.  Other recent studies identified as relevant in our exploration of  LGBTQ+ experiences of  doctoral education include: Ings (2015) study of  queer postgraduate students in the visual arts, Maritz and Prinsloo (2015) study of  queer academic identities in postgraduate education, and Ahmed’s (2012) and Smith’s (2015) extensive texts on diversity work in Higher Education. Ings (2015) research high-lights the challenges researchers face when their work inextricably connects to their LGBTQ+ identi-ty and how this can generate feelings of  vulnerability, exoticization, and difference. For Maritz and Prinsloo (2015), notions of  identity also feed into the process of  becoming an academic. For the au-thors, the ‘normative map of  being and becoming an academic does not adequately provide for the nomadic/alternative/queer identities’, which led them at points in their journey to feel isolated and marginalized (p. 697).  Although the focus of  both Ahmed’s (2012) and Smith’s (2015) work is not LGBTQ+ experiences of  doctoral education, their work is important here as it provides an interpretive and theoretical framework for diversity work within Higher Education. For both, an understanding of  issues that face particular groups and of  intersectionality is needed to ensure that diversity work leads to struc-tures, systems and spaces that are inclusive for all. For Smith, this requires a consideration of  local and global contexts, with a focus specifically on climate and intergroup relations, access and success, education and scholarship, and institutional viability and vitality (2015, p. 72). This study addresses all four of  these areas through a focus on the doctoral journey and supervisory relationship, profession-al working relationships, institutional research environments, and understandings of  the intersection between identity and doctoral work. For Ahmed (2012), diversity work is a phenomenological prac-tice in that it produces knowledge not only about institutions, but also of  those institutions, knowledge that is situated and contextual and that surfaces tensions between policy and practice, and between individual and institution. This study draws on a phenomenological methodology (described below) to ensure a diversity of  voices are presented and that differences and tensions are not inad-vertently smoothed over or concealed, but openly discussed. As such, it is important to acknowledge that while this study predominantly focuses on the analysis of  responses to the questionnaire, it is Documenting Diversity 406 also shaped by the lived experiences of  Fenby-Hulse as an LGBTQ+ researcher, and our shared ex-periences and practitioner experience of  doctoral education and diversity work that is undertaken in our roles as research and researcher development managers within the UK. Building on the work of  the above scholars, this study complements and extends their work by providing a comprehensive insight into the experiences of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers from across the UK and from broad range of  disciplines. By focusing solely on the experiences of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers, this study offers much needed nuance on the varied experiences of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers in the UK. The recommendations stemming from this study, though, are not solely of  benefit to those who identify as LGBTQ+ as they encourage the development of  research cultures and environments that are open and inclusive for all.  EXPERIENCES OF THE WIDER LGBTQ+ STUDENT POPULATION Although studies focusing on the LGBTQ+ doctoral population are lacking, there are some studies of  the wider LGBTQ+ student population that offer a frame of  reference for considering the expe-riences of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers. Three significant pieces of  work in this area are: Ellis’ (2009) study of  harassment and discrimination of  LGBT undergraduate students’ in the UK; the Equality Challenge Unit’s (2009) report on the experiences of  LGBT staff  and students in Higher Education; and Mckendry and Lawrence’s (2017) TransEdu Scotland report on the experience of  trans and gender diverse applicants, students and staff  in Scotland’s colleges and universities. The main finding of  Ellis’ research is that homophobia remains a problem at UK universities. She states that ‘although extreme acts (e.g. actual physical violence) are relatively uncommon, verbal har-assment and anti-LGBT sentiments are prevalent’ with most harassment stemming from other stu-dents (2009, p. 735). The 2009 Equality Challenge Unit report echoes much of  the findings of  Ellis, although offers some additional detail. For instance, the report draws attention to the fact that two-thirds of  lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) students are not out to their tutors or lecturers, as they fear discrimination. The report also finds that trans- students encountered higher levels of  negative treatment than LGB students. Overall, the report highlights how ‘banal forms of  negative treatment’ can lead to stress, loss of  confidence, and self-exclusion (2009, p. 2). The National Union of  Student report (2014) on LGBT students’ experience in higher education and the Higher Education Academy and Higher Education Policy Institute’s Student Academic Experience Survey (Neves & Hillman, 2017) suggest problems persist. The HEA report highlights ‘a striking difference in wellbeing levels between students who classify themselves as straight, compared to those who classify themselves as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Asexual or Other’ (2017, p. 46). Mckendry and Lawrence’s (2017) report is the first to examine in detail experiences of  trans- and gender diverse students and staff. The report focuses on Scottish Higher Education Institutions and provides a level of  analysis not found in other reports and studies on the student experience of  trans- and gender diverse students. The report high-lights the barriers to learning these students (and staff) face, with many feeling unsafe and unwel-come on campus and experiencing ignorance and hostility from peers and colleagues. The report also highlights the high withdrawal rate and the significant proportion of  trans- and gender diverse stu-dents and staff  that feel unable and unsupported to raise issues and talk about the challenges they face.  As well as these overarching reports, a number of  studies that also have focused on specific issues and intersections that can be experienced by LGBTQ+ students. Falconer and Taylor (2017), for in-stance, highlights the importance of  considering intersections between queer and religious identities, arguing that university study acts as a transitional experience that provides opportunities for students to reflect on and rethink identity and intersections between identities. Cech and Waidzunas’s (2011) work on the experiences of  LGB undergraduate engineers is also of  interest as it highlights how some education environments can be implicitly heteronormative and lead to the exclusion and silenc-ing of  LGB students, creating a ‘chilly’ working atmosphere. Poynter and Washington’s (2005) work on intersectionality and multiple identities is also useful in thinking about campus communities as English & Fenby-Hulse 407 complex and the importance of  allowing and enabling students ‘to “name” themselves and their identities’ and to not ask them to choose one identity over another (p. 47).   IDENTITY AND DOCTORAL STUDY While the above articles and reports do not offer a detailed exploration of  the experiences of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers, they suggest a comprehensive study would be worthwhile in order to understand the intersection between doctoral study, sexual orientation and gender identity. Indeed, numerous scholars of  doctoral education and supervision have argued that doctoral study and identi-ty are interlinked (McAlpine & Amundsen, 2009; O’Meara, Griffin, Kuvaeva, Nyunt, & Robinson, 2017). As Wisker (2012) argues in her handbook on good supervision: ‘Homosexual, lesbian or het-erosexual subject positions might affect research topics, theorizing strategies and interpersonal be-haviors’ (p. 318). Understanding the experiences of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers, therefore, can inform approaches to, and understandings of, research supervision. For Lee (2012), the supervisory relationship a key component of  doctoral education (alongside emancipation, critical thinking, encul-turation, and project-based support). As she states, for supervision to be truly effective an ‘emotion-ally-intelligent relationship’ between supervisor and student is needed’ (2012, p. 13).  Supervisory ‘fit’ (Pyhältö, Vekkaila, & Keskinen, 2015) and the role the supervisor plays in developing a researcher’s agency (McAlpine & Amundsen, 2009) and independence (Baker and Pifer, 2011) are all understood as important to an effective supervisory relationship and in enhancing student satisfaction, resilience, and in ensuring completions.  However, as Lee (2012) acknowledges, there is also ‘an overarching tension between the professional and the personal which surfaces particularly in the academic’s role as a supervisor or advisor’ (p. 13). This is something that is, perhaps, exacerbated by the private and complex nature of  doctoral super-vision (Johnson, Lee, & Green, 2000), which is often centered on a one-to-one or two-to-one rela-tionship between supervisor(s) and student. As such, it is important, as Rogers-Shaw and Carr-Chellman (2018) have shown, that an ethics of  care forms part of  the pedagogy of  doctoral supervi-sion to ensure a meaningful relationship that supports academic learning. The danger of  turbulent, toxic, and tense supervisory relationships is that the student (and the project) suffers. As has been shown, poor social support networks, poor supervisory relationships, and a lack of  a sense of  be-longing can all lead to emotional exhaustion, burn-out, and ultimately non-completion (Devine & Hunter, 2016; O’Meara et al., 2017; Peltonen, Vekkaila, Rautio, Haverinen, and Pyhältö, 2017) This study fills a gap in current understandings of  doctoral education by documenting and analyzing the experiences of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers to address the question of  whether current ap-proaches to doctoral education are inclusive and offer supportive working environments for LGBTQ+ researchers. As the doctoral population increases and diversifies, it is important, as Hopwood and Paulson (2012) argue, that students’ bodies are taken seriously. As they state: ‘doctoral practices are often conceived as disembodied and yet, at the same time, implicitly assume a certain kind of  (white, male) body’ (p. 670). This article presents the diverse experiences of  the LGBTQ+ doctoral population in the UK to encourage reflection on the working environments and cultures in which doctoral study takes place and to identify areas where change, support, and/or development are needed. METHODOLOGY Doctoral students who self-identified as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and/or Queer+ (i.e. consider themselves outside traditional heterosexual or gender identities) at selected UK Higher Ed-ucation institutions were invited to complete an online questionnaire. The institutions were selected to ensure a diversity of  environment based on size of  doctoral community, age of  institution (partic-ularly concerning whether institutions pre-dated the large-scale change in UK higher education in 1992), and geographical location (in terms of  region and urban/rural campuses). The questionnaire was not promoted beyond those institutions that granted permission. However, participants from Documenting Diversity 408 other institutions who had heard of  the questionnaire through their networks and had chosen to re-spond have been included in the analysis. In institutions where formal cooperation was obtained, it was asked that the questionnaire be promoted as widely as possible; there was no attempt to select individual or groups of  participants from within those institutions. The questionnaire was housed on the Bristol Online Surveys platform and was open for eight weeks from mid-January 2017. Adminis-trators and academic leads with responsibility for postgraduate research degrees in 42 institutions were contacted to secure permission and assistance in reaching out to their students. To guarantee anonymity for participants, no question was marked as mandatory and identifying details were not requested. All responses below have been anonymized. The response was higher than anticipated, with 224 doctoral researchers from at least 47 institutions (six participants declined to provide their institutional affiliation) completing the questionnaire. 82 percent of  respondents were studying full-time, 11 percent part-time, with the remainder choosing not to answer. 25 percent were aged 25 or under; 42 percent were between 26 and 30; 16 percent were between 31 and 35; 8 percent between 36 and 40; 4 percent between 41 and 45; 2 percent be-tween 46 and 50; 3 percent between 51 and 55; one participant was between 56 and 60, and one de-clined to say. The questionnaire explored how respondents felt their sexual orientation and/or gender identity connected to and impacted on their personal and professional life as a doctoral candidate. Participa-tion was entirely voluntary. From the outset it was decided that a quantitative approach to analyzing the responses would be inappropriate as the aim was to capture the diversity of  experiences and, where possible, to understand nuance, intersectionality, and differences in perspective. As such, when asking questions concerned with the doctoral researchers’ sexual orientation/expression and/or gen-der identity/expression, pre-selected categories were not used and have not been used post-hoc for the purposes of  correlation. Accordingly, in order to allow respondents to accurately convey their gender identity and sexual orientation or expression and for us to capture the diversity of  respond-ents, free-text responses were requested for the following questions:  • Please describe your gender identity and/or expression • Please describe your sexual orientation and/or expression  • What other factors do you consider important to your identity (this may include ethnicity, nationality, sex, religion, disability, familial roles and responsibilities, subculture identities, group membership, and professional roles, etc.?) While some respondents chose to use traditional categorizations, the free-text response allowed oth-ers to provide much needed nuance: “I usually describe my gender identity as gender fluid, meaning that my feelings of  gender identity are not static. I usually feel as a man or as some kind of  other gender not male nor female but com-prising elements of  both, and more rarely I feel as a woman. These feelings change day by day, and are affected by a number of  circumstances including clothing, environment, what I’m doing, etc.” (emphasis ours) Age was the only personal identifier where predefined categories were used.  For the rest of  the questionnaire, a mixture of  open questions and fixed-alternative questions (ac-companied by secondary free text ‘further comments’ were used (see the appendix). While the main focus of  this study is on individual experiences, fixed-alternative questioning acted as a guide for re-spondents in thinking through their experiences and provided context for the analysis of  responses; in essence they acted as markers or ‘flags in the ground’ by which to analyze and interpret responses. Fixed-alternative questions included: the number of  supervisors on the supervisory team; the groups of  people aware of  the respondent’s sexual orientation/expression and/or gender identi-ty/expression; the types of  harassment or aggression experienced; and the extent to which respond-ents felt their institution provided an inclusive environment. While the use of  statistics to summarize English & Fenby-Hulse 409 responses is appropriate in certain contexts to give an overview and to identify trends, the focus of  this study was on individual experience and diversity. As Smith, Flowers, and Larkin (2009) state, ‘the founding principal of  phenomenological inquiry is that experience should be examined in the way that it occurs, and in its own terms’ (p. 12). So, for instance, while it could be presented in positive terms that only 1.3 percent of  our respondents stated that their primary supervisor is not LGBTQ+ friendly (see Figure 1), this would erase the experiences of  the three people within this sample that were currently experiencing difficulties.   Figure 1: Do you consider your primary supervisor(s) to be LGBTQ+ friendly?  It has been shown that those who identify as LGBTQ+ often choose to relocate to large cities that have established LGBTQ+ communities as well as a range of  LGBTQ+ support and amenities on offer (Ellis, 2007). It was important when designing this study (and when analyzing the data) to note that it was likely a significant number of  responses would be received from larger universities and those based in cities with more LGBTQ+ facilities and representation. To avoid a focus solely on the experiences of  the majority, this study provides contextual nuance by ensuring the experiences of  those respondents that study at small rural universities, those that are representative of  LGBTQ+ subcultures, those that providing intersectional perspectives, and those that offer unique or conflict-ing perspectives and experiences are documented. Indeed, in building inclusive environments, it is important that the diversity of  experiences be recognized so that spaces are developed that work for all.  An interpretative phenomenological approach (Cerbone, 2014; Smith et al., 2009; Van Manen, 2016; Watson, 2001) was, thus, undertaken to focus on the different ways in which doctoral researchers experienced their environment, institution, supervision, colleagues and academia more widely. As Ahmed (2006) has argued, phenomenology can provide a particularly powerful approach to under-stand queer perspectives and the experiences of  those that identify as LGBTQ+. The use of  free-text responses through the questionnaire was essential to this and to examining how people perceive, understand, and define their identity and their experiences of  doctoral supervision. This approach Did Not Answer1.34%Not Sure21.8%No1.34%Yes75.45%Documenting Diversity 410 enabled us to investigate the extent to which institutions provide an inclusive environment for all doctoral researchers, as there is no objective truth beyond the experiences of  those students.  Analysis was approached in four stages. Firstly, anticipatory themes were identified from the existing literature on LGBTQ+ experiences of  higher education, as discussed above. These were not to be tested, but to support contextualization of  the data. The literature review was iterative and continued during data collection in response to the data. Secondly, the responses were studied; each response considered within the context of  the respondent’s submission to enable the researchers to better un-derstand that individual’s experience. Responses were read by both authors, each making notes on key objects of  concern.  Thirdly, one researcher used NVIVO software to code free-text responses and establish common themes, noting recurrence (although not letting this drive the study for the reason stated above). The results were then passed to the second researcher who checked their validity by comparison with notes from the first-stage reading of  the responses and the themes present in the existing literature. Finally, once agreement was reached between the researchers, commonalities across themes were identified to produce five broad themes. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION Findings and discussion are here presented together so that the responses and emerging themes can be discussed in reference to, and contextualized within, the extant literature. This allows for a deeper interpretative engagement with the experiences expressed by the respondents. Throughout, a diversi-ty of  views are presented that focus on both the positive and negative experiences of  doctoral study. Whilst it is important to explore in detail the challenges people face so that institutional and sectoral improvements can be made, it is also important to note that many respondents have no issue with many aspects of  their education and that the difficulties they did encounter were not always linked, or solely linked, to their sexual orientation or gender identity. For example, when asked if  there had been occasions at their academic institution (other than with their supervisory team) where they had felt uncomfortable or felt that they had to conceal their sexual orientation/expression and/or gender identity/expression, 63 percent of  respondents answered in the negative (Figure 2). Similarly, 72 per-cent of  respondents felt their department offered an inclusive environment (Figure 3).  Figure 2: Are there any other situations at your academic institution [other than with your supervisory team] in which you have felt uncomfortable or felt that you had to conceal your sexual orientation / expression, and/or your gender identity / expression?  63.4 36.6 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70NoYesPercentage English & Fenby-Hulse 411  Figure 3: To what extent would you agree that your department offers an inclusive  environment for LGBTQ+ researchers? For one respondent, the desirability of  conducting this study at all was called into question: “We don’t need another study that say XX% of  XXXX group reported people once said nasty things to them, with no control for context it does nothing positive and allows idiots to pressure institutions into taking stances on issues that could well be non-existent and would be better left as irrelevant to the university’s function. Please stop this unnecessary intrusion into the personal lives of  everyone who isn’t straight.”  This comment echoes the work of  Jagessar and Msibi (2015) that argues that same-sex University students should not be perceived simply as powerless or victims, the picture often being much more complex. This study seeks to acknowledge this complexity, whilst also acknowledging the importance as Msibi and Jagessar also argue, of  challenging patriarchy and heteronormativity in Higher Educa-tion to ensure institutions function as inclusive and diverse spaces. This study is sensitive to the di-versity of  experiences and documents this complexity in the discussion below. EMERGING THEMES For the most part, the themes emerged in different ways and from different perspectives, across the questionnaire and not from single questions or sections. However, to help structure the discussion for the reader, some of  the key questions that link to theme under discussed are articulated at the outset. A full list of  questions can be found in the appendix.   Environments and exclusion In response to questions on experiences, perception and institutional support, many respondents reported that they felt they worked within environments where heteronormative, cisnormative and binary-gender assumptions (that is that all people are heterosexual and clearly identify with their physical gender of  their birth) were the norm. Questions included: Strongly Agree, 42.86%Agree, 29.02%Disagree, 8.48%Strongly Disagree, 0.45%Not Sure, 17.86% Documenting Diversity 412 • Thinking specifically about your sexual orientation/expression and/or gender identi-ty/expression, do you feel included in all aspects university/college life? • Do you feel there are any opportunities open to researchers that you would be/have been re-luctant to take up because of  concerns about discrimination connected to your sexual orien-tation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression? • To what extent would you agree that the following offer an inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ researchers? • Do you feel your sexual orientation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression will have an effect on your future career? The individual cultural environment of  departments, research units or institutions were frequently mentioned as crucial to how comfortable a student was in their role. Such perceptions of  how inclu-sive the working culture varied between institutions and departments or other academic units. As stated above, most respondents agreed that their department offered an inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ researchers (Figure 3) and 82 percent said the same of  their institution. Several respond-ents were keen to praise their institution, department or supervisory team for enabling a welcoming environment: “Yes, sometimes it’s complicated being out. I’m lucky to be in the psychology department and in a very LGBT* friendly campus.” “I have found PhD study to be better than the work place in most respects (accepting colleagues, support available).” “It’s easy for me to say that because I am cis-gender, but I do think that the staff  in my department are quite clued up. We have transgender undergraduate students and they are treated equally and with respect (as far as I am aware). My sexual orientation is my own business but it’s certainly not some-thing I feel the need to be secretive about any more than I would in a work place. Again though, that’s easy for me to say because I’m not ‘visible’.” For others, an inclusive and open culture was perceived to be lacking (leading in some cases to ageist assumptions): “Within the physical sciences there is a definite heterosexual male culture, and many holding posi-tions of  power are also older and may be less tolerant of  LGBTQ+ identities.” “The mainstream is patriarchal and heterosexist, it reproduces itself  and gives opportunities only to those within the norm (white gay/straight men or \"powerful\" middle-class white lesbians and hetero-sexual women, although these are a minority).” Issues were also raised about when, in the course of  a working day, aspects of  people’s personal lives were brought into conversation. For some respondents, this was an uncomfortable experience and representative of  a broader culture of  hetero- or cis-normativity:  “I have noticed colleagues being asked how their respective partners are by my supervisors, but I have never had such questions. This might be for other reasons, but it’s hard to be sure.” “In the communal staff/PhD kitchen area there is often weekend/social talk that can reflect ‘lad’ culture at times, making me feel more inclined not to bring up any issues of  my own private life.” For some respondents the question of  their working environment and culture and how that affected their experience of  study was more than a feeling of  not being part of  the dominant culture. Some reported an environment which permitted, or turned a blind eye, to more aggressive or isolating be-havior: “I’m in a very macho male-dominate faculty (a STEM one), so it feels awkward when my co-PhDers make sexuality comments. When I did mention my sexuality, I had one male colleague \"invite\" me to English & Fenby-Hulse 413 have a threesomes with their partner, which was disgustingly inappropriate and has hindered me from socializing with them until he completed his course.” “I would feel uncomfortable telling certain senior members of  staff  about my sexuality if  the subject was to ever arise - this is due to the general culture of  the school which is not very accepting and at times actively misogynistic.” Others reported how the culture and environment in which they worked led to feelings of  exclusion, with some feeling isolated or outside of  every-day departmental life. Several respondents felt that any isolation that came with the nature of  PhD research was increased because of  issues related to sexual orientation or gender identity: “I also think that, because PhD study is inherently isolated, identifying as queer is to risk exacerbating that social exclusion” “I think some cis LGBQ students are likely to feel like they don’t fit in with the rest of  their cohort which might exacerbate feelings of  loneliness and isolation which most PhD students deal with any-way.” Some respondents also felt that the isolation associated with doctoral student connected to wider social activities, such as LGBTQ+ related networks: “LGBTQ+ staff  have a support group and undergraduates have the LGBTQ+ club on campus but I feel like it’s hard for people my age & at this stage in our career to participate in either.” Intersectional identities could also further feelings of  exclusion and isolation, with respondents feel-ing sometimes as if  across and between different networks, groups, and societies; a tension played out in some cases structurally, leading to what Formby (2017) has called a ‘hierarchy of  inclusive spaces’: “I am a member of  our women’s network and I feel as if  they compartmentalize LGBTQ+ issues as being something to discuss in the appropriate staff  society whereas I’d like to see the women’s net-work discuss it amongst a broad cross section of  women not just those who identify as LGBTQ+” “Even the LGBT safe space was in the same corridor as the ecumenical religious space” Feelings of  being excluded from campus-based activities, events, and groups was particularly preva-lent in responses from students who reported issues related to their gender identity. This brought in issues of  the use of  pronouns for administration and/or spoken introductions, the lack of  gender-neutral bathrooms and exclusion from gender-based initiatives: “A ‘female-only’ reading group was set up.  It was then amended to ‘female and non-binary only’. I was uncomfortable at the thought of  identifying myself  as publicly non-binary, so did not attend.” “I wonder why there are so many \"women in STEM\" events - it’s cool if  they were just called that but actually actively open to all people who are oppressed based on their gender and hence trans in-clusive.” “It is…fairly common that the university provides support for female identifying students and staff. Whilst this is helpful, the space created is often highly hetero-normative with discussions centering around childcare, pesky husbands etc. This can be alienating in a space which is aiming to be safe.” “Some services, like Careers, are quite traditional and binary.” “When playing sport: the organization of  spaces and activities tends to be binary.” The issue of  a welcoming or unwelcoming culture being dependent on the attitudes and behavior of  senior staff  was recurrent. This was coupled with a reticence by the doctoral researchers to challenge the views or behavior of  more senior staff  due to the imbalance of  power and potential perceived impact on their PhD or future job prospects: Documenting Diversity 414 “I know more than one senior academic, who may be on a hiring committee in my future career, who have gone on homophobic rants in front of  me. Thus, if  they somehow found out my sexuality, they might be less inclined to hire me.” “[there was] a very \"laddish\" attitude of  casual sexism and homophobia in some conferences which I did not challenge as [I] was very junior (I feel more confident now and think I would challenge) “[There is] trans ignorance [among] senior academic staff ” The issue of  an inclusive culture, for respondents, extends beyond the department or research divi-sion. For doctoral researchers, this may be the first time in their career that they are expected to op-erate academically outside their institution: “Around most older/traditional academics at conferences….it feels hard enough being a young work-ing class woman…even harder talking about feminist issues. Talking about my sexuality is scary - es-pecially when bi women are so fetishized and older male academics can be creeps at the best of  times.” “When meeting new people especially at conferences and meetings, there is an instant assumption that I am straight and find conversations about relationships brought up by others to be slightly awkward. You’re never really sure how someone is going to react and therefore it can feel intimidat-ing.” “I haven’t been to any conferences since coming out because I’m afraid of  being half-recognized by people who don’t know me v well or maybe don’t know I’m out and have changed my name etc. On twitter I avoid getting involved in academic discussions or critiquing things related to my field, where I might have been happier to before, as I feel like I will be taken less seriously.” Suggestions of  feeling side-lined from the culture of  the academic workplace extended to issues of  exclusion in a variety of  contexts. Isolation is known to be a concern linked to doctoral study more generally and includes feelings of  being disconnected from the main (undergraduate) student body and not yet accepted within staff  circles, as seen in the above extracts (Chiang, 2003). Isolation is also a theme highlighted in the aforementioned surveys and questionnaires that addresses the wider LGBTQ+ student population (ECU, 2009; Ellis, 2009). For Epstein and Johnson (1994), feelings of  isolation and exclusion are a result of  failure to recognize difference and the positing of  an ‘unam-biguously heterosexual world’ (p. 198). It has been shown that feelings of  isolation and exclusion within a work environment, whether perceived or real, have potential implications for the wellbeing (Gates, 2011; Irwin, 2007; Lloen & Parini, 2017; Mule et al., 2009) and productivity (Badgett, Durso, Kastani, & Mallory, 2013; Credit Suisse, 2016; Guasp, & Balfour, 2008) of  those that identify as LGBTQ+. Within Higher Education, Pyhältö, Vekkaila, and Keskinen (2015) have shown, more generally, that a lack of  social support can lead to disengagement during doctoral study; Sanchez et al. (2015) has shown that LGBT inclusion within the academic health community can lead to better personal and professional development; and Wickens, and Sandlin (2010) have shown how hostile, heteronormative environments within Higher Education institutions can lead to a culture of  fear and, as a result, the erasure of  LGBT voices and experiences. For Cech and Waidzunas (2011), whose research focused on LGB student engineers, if  LGB experiences are marginalized, ‘the unmarked category heterosexuality is legitimated and imbued with power’, silencing the voices of  LGB stu-dents.  The above responses suggest that the combination, in particular, of  a doctoral and an LGBTQ+ identity can lead not only feelings of  isolation and exclusion, but also a lack of  voice and representa-tion within academic spaces.  Micro-aggressions, assumptions, and harassment Within the broader themes of  culture and exclusion, a specific issue that arose was that of  hetero- and cisnormative assumptions. Questions that generated responses on this theme included: English & Fenby-Hulse 415 • To what extent do you agree that your sexual orientation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression status should be recognized and understood by colleagues? • Are there any other situations at your academic institution [other than with your supervisory team] in which you have felt uncomfortable or felt that you had to conceal your sexual orien-tation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression? • Have you ever experienced any of  the following within your institution because of  your sex-ual orientation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression: negative comments, ver-bal abuse, threatening behavior, physical abuse, stereotyping, homophobic jokes, other mar-ginalizing behaviours, micro-aggressions? Whilst responses varies, most common were comments regarding the persistent assumption of  sexu-ality or gender: “In situations where it is assumed I am straight, and I have to correct this - I don’t mind much but it’s a bit tedious, and reinforces me feeling ‘other’”.  “I am assumed to be a gender I am not - it is exhausting to correct people and I am worried for my academic relationships if  I do”. “Stop assuming that everyone is straight, thus forcing people to have to choose whether to ‘come out’ every time they meet someone new”. “People assuming I’m straight/will behave in a certain way and get surprised/offended when I don’t”. For some respondents, there was a clear division between their personal and professional lives. As will be shown below when discussing supervisory relations, responses were received that questioned the relevance of, particularly, a student’s sexual orientation to their academic work. However, others saw the environment they worked in as one that contained social elements as well; where conversa-tions would naturally include aspects of  people’s personal lives. Here is where hetero- and cisnorma-tive assumptions proved problematic: “I have been in meetings with students and staff  from other faculties… and in professional devel-opment courses where I felt like it was assumed that everyone in the room was heterosexual because of  how the conversation was going and it made me feel uncomfortable and like I shouldn’t mention my partner.” “One older colleague saw my wedding ring and asked me if  I was married. When I replied in the af-firmative, she asked me what my husband does for a living. I didn’t pull her up on it, because alt-hough I didn’t expect her to have any issues with my sexuality, I didn’t want to make her feel awk-ward for making innocent assumptions.” “People assume I’m straight a lot of  the time. A visiting professor asked about my boyfriend, I didn’t feel the need to correct her. It happens often and it can be awkward if  you correct the person espe-cially if  you don’t know them well or it wouldn’t make any difference for them to know/not know.” Issues of  assumptions were not limited to hetero- and cis-normativity. Some respondents also felt that when attention was paid to the needs of  LGBTQ+ students, there was a tendency towards gen-eralizations, reducing the person to that aspect of  their identity, and of  not taking into account how identifying as LGBTQ+ intersects with others parts of  their identity: “[Do not] assume LGB are a single homogenous group. Questioning students require different sup-port [to] lesbian and gays for example.” “Stop assuming that every (LGBTQ+) person who attends university has far-left political views and be more inclusive of  other sides of  the debate.” “LGBTQ+ =/= GGGGG” Documenting Diversity 416 “Stop stereotyping LGBTQ+ people when it comes to social activities etc.” “I wish the casual assumptions about what it means to be bisexual could be challenged more by the student body. I overhear a lot of  nasty jokes and I’m often the recipient of  a lot of  indelicate pro-posals from my fellow students if  they find out.”  This also extended to research-related assumptions. Because of  their sexual and/or gender identity, some respondents felt it was assumed that they would want to take their research in a particular di-rection: “There is also the fact that identifying strongly and publicly with the LGBTQ community means that people tend to assume that’s where your research will be directed, and you are assigned to that partic-ular camp regardless of  your intentions.” “PhD candidates are at risk of  having their research over-determined by their sexual identity. For example, a postcolonial scholar, such as myself, risks having their research condensed into a com-mentary on queer issues.” The above could all be described as microaggressions. Nadal (2013) argues that micro-aggressions take many forms. In his taxonomy of  micro-aggressions that an LGBTQ+ person can face, he in-cludes: the use of  heterosexist or transphobic terminology; the endorsement of  heteronormative or gender normative culture and behaviors; the assumption of  a universal LGBT experience; exoticiza-tion; discomfort and disapproval of  the LGBT experience; denial of  heterosexism or transphobia; assumption of  sexual behavior or pathology; and denial of  individual heterosexism (p. 44-45). As well taking a variety of  different forms, microaggressions are also often unconscious, implicit, and/or cultural. As such, they can be difficult to identify and articulate. This, as Nadal states, can put an emotional burden on the affected person, who may be unsure or unclear as how to respond and may experience feelings such as fear, discomfort, anger, frustration, sadness, embarrassment, and shame. A variety of  these emotions are presented in the responses, providing insight into, and evidence of, the emotional process and labor that, for some of  our respondents, form part of  the daily experience of  being an LGBTQ+ doctoral researcher.  As part of  the questionnaire, respondents were asked whether they had ever experienced any type of  aggression or microaggression within their institution because of  their sexual orientation/expression and/or gender identity/expression. Just under half  of  the respondents (111) reported that they had not (Figure 4). Of  those that had experienced aggression, the most common was stereotyping (re-ported by 67 people), followed by homophobic jokes (58), ‘other marginalizing behaviors and/or micro-aggressions’ (33) and negative comments (28).  Ten respondents said they had experiences verbal abuse, four reported threatening behavior and one had experience physical abuse. When asked if  they were aware of  other LGBTQ+ researchers at their university/college who have suffered from homophobic or transphobic discrimination or abuse within the institution, 72 percent answered ‘no’, ten percent ‘yes’ and 18 per cent ‘not sure’.  These insights, though, need to be treated with caution. As Nadal notes, micro-aggressions are not easy to determine or describe and are often embedded within institutions, cultures, and society. As such, these more subtle forms of  discrimination affect people in different ways and may not be readi-ly apparent at the time to those that experience them and an accepted (or unseen) part of  the world in which they live.  English & Fenby-Hulse 417  Figure 4: Have you ever experienced any of the following within your institution because of your sexual orientation / expression, and/or your gender identity / expression? Supervisory relations One of  the key aspects which makes doctoral study unique (and thus makes this cohort worthy of  separate investigation) is the central place of  the supervisor or supervisory team in the development of  both the research project and the researcher. The importance of  the supervisory relationship to student success both in the short and longer term has been much discussed (Baker & Pifer, 2011; Lee, 2008; Wisker, 2012). It is also clear that doctoral supervisors frequently see themselves playing a much wider role than simply an advisor on an academic research project; often encompassing the development of  a wider professional relationship between supervisor and student (Lee, 2008; Wisker, Robinson, & Shacham, 2007), while recognizing that this not the case with all supervisors. Accord-ingly, if  students experienced issues in their doctoral studies because of  their sexual orienta-tion/expression and/or gender identity/expression it is reasonable to expect that the student’s su-pervisor(s) may play a part in either the problem or its resolution. To explore this dynamic, the below questions were posed: • Is your supervisory team aware of  your sexual orientation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression? • Do you consider your primary supervisor(s) to be LGBTQ+ friendly?  • Do you think it is important and/or relevant for your supervisory team to be aware of  your sexual orientation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression? • Do you feel your sexual orientation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression af-fects your relationship with your supervisor/supervisory team? The most common supervisory arrangement was for there to be a first and second supervisor (expe-rienced by 53 percent of  respondents), followed by a larger supervisory team (13 percent), a single supervisor (13 percent) or two joint supervisors (11 percent). Ten percent reported an alternative arrangement.  28 10 4 1 67 58 33 111 020406080100120Negative commentsVerbal abuseThreateningbehaviourPhysical abuseStereotypingHomophobic JokesOther marginalisingbehaviours…None of the aboveTotal Number of Experiences Documenting Diversity 418 Respondents were asked if  their supervisory team was aware of  their sexual orientation/expression and/or gender identity/expression. 33 percent said they were; 14 percent said some but not all of  their supervisory team were; 23 percent said their supervisory team were not aware; and 30 percent were not sure (Figure 5a). The extent to which it is desirable or necessary for a supervisor(s) to be aware of  a student’s sexual orientation/expression and/or gender identity/expression divided our respondents (Figure 5b).   Figure 5(a): Is your supervisory team aware of your sexual orientation / expression, and/or your gender identity / expression? Figure 5(b): Do you think it is important and/or relevant for your supervisory team to be aware of your sexual orientation / expres-sion, and/or your gender identity / expres-sion? For a number of  our respondents the way they viewed their supervisor(s) role was purely functional and, as such, saw no reason why they would need or want to ensure their supervisor(s) was aware of  their sexual orientation/expression and/or gender identity/expression: “It does not affect the professional relationship between my supervisors and I. Frankly it is also none of  their business.” “Why on earth would they care or need to know? I’m not planning on [sleeping with] either of  them.” For others, it had importance: “I think it makes a big difference whether or not an LGBTQ+ student feels like they can be open both to their supervisor(s) and to other PhD students. Not feeling accepted (or hiding part of  their identity out of  fear of  not being accepted) can have a very negative impact on interpersonal relation-ships, and thus cause/exacerbate mental health issues.” “I should have told my supervisor much earlier.” “There are still a number of  legal/social/cultural forms of  discrimination that LGBTQ+ undergo so I feel that it’s important that supervisors be knowledgeable and aware of  these concerns as they ulti-mately may hinder the work of  the researcher as well as their psychological/mental health.” When asked if  they felt their sexual orientation/expression and/or gender identity/expression af-fected the relationship they had their supervisory team, 74 percent of  respondents said it didn’t, 14 percent thought it did, with 12 percent unsure. For those who knew their supervisor(s) was aware of  their sexual orientation or gender identity, many reported it as a positive aspect of  their supervisory relations. Yes, 36.20%No, 22.80%Not all, 14.30%Not Sure, 30.40%Yes, 34.40%No, 42.90%Not sure, 22.30%No answer, 0.40%English & Fenby-Hulse 419 “I feel at ease with my supervisors - particularly with my first supervisor - and conversations have taken place about, for example, my husband or my wedding. I feel it’s important not to feel pressured into telling, but I also believe is beneficial to let it flow naturally. After all, that’s being oneself.” “I have a close relationship with my supervisor, who is very committed to ensuring her students’ emotional and mental well-being as well as their academic well-being. I feel it is important for her to be aware of  my sexuality as this may impact my mental health and the way that people within a pro-fessional environment treat me. This affects my relationship as it means she offers me support in a different way to students who do not identify as LGBTQIA and can be aware of  any issues which may arise. In the past, when issues have arisen, she has been extremely supportive.” “My relationship with my supervisor has not changed since she became aware of  my orientation. She is wonderfully supportive and we have on occasion chatted about it but I do not feel as though our relationship is affected.” Of  those who responded that one or more of  their supervisory team were not aware of  their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, 38 percent of  those indicated that they had felt unable to make them aware; although the request for an explanation of  why they felt unable revealed that some of  those respondents felt no need to make their supervisor(s) aware, rather than unable to. There were, though, a number of  respondents who genuinely felt that they were unable to reveal their sexual ori-entation/expression and/or gender identity/expression to at least one of  their supervisory team. The dominant theme that emerged from these responses was one of  fear or uncertainty regarding the reaction this would engender. “I’m in a male dominated field, so I worry it would impact my academic employment chances.” “I have no reason to think that they are trans-, or homophobic, but especially with regards to gender identity, it is such a controversial and divisive issue in society that I don’t currently feel comfortable discussing this with them for fear that it will jeopardize our working relationship.” “I’m sure they would probably have no issue with it but… there’s a bit of  a weird stigma around bi-sexuality and I wouldn’t want them to view me any differently.” “I know that my supervisor is quite Protestant and I’ve heard that he think being gay is a sin.” “Both my supervisors are lovely people, however the anxiety of  wondering if  their opinion of  me would change if  they found out the truth makes me uncomfortable engaging with them socially.” There were some comments from respondents who felt their sexuality was irrelevant to their super-visory relations which suggested they assumed that by asking the question “Is your supervisory team aware of  your sexual orientation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression?” that it was intimated that a student should be ‘out’ to their supervisory team. This was not the intention. Given the pivotal nature of  the supervisor in a doctoral student’s journey, it was felt that an exploration of  whether students felt they could be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity (as subse-quent questions sought to establish) and what the impact of  that would be on their subsequent expe-riences was important given previous research on LGBTQ+ identities within educational and work-place contexts (Colgan & McKearney, 2012; Kosciw, Palmer, & Kull, 2015; LaSala, Jenkins, Wheeler, & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2008; Wickens & Sandlin, 2010). Internationalization By far the most common concern raised by participants was the potential difficulties in operating in a work environment where international mobility is fast becoming the norm. This was raised, in par-ticular, in responses to the below questions: • Are there any issues which you think LGBTQ+ students might encounter during doctoral study? Documenting Diversity 420 • Are there any other situations at your academic institution (other than with your supervisory team) in which you have felt uncomfortable or felt that you had to conceal your sexual orien-tation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression? • Do you feel there are any opportunities open to researchers that you would be/have been re-luctant to take up because of  concerns about discrimination connected to your sexual orien-tation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression? • What, if  anything, would you like your institution to do to improve the experience of  LGBTQ+ doctoral research students? Internationally-based field work, conferences, collaborations and post-doctoral employment are an expected part of  many doctoral researcher’s work and future career. When these opportunities arise in countries that are culturally or legally hostile towards those that identify as LGBTQ+, serious is-sues arise: “…occasionally work has become available in countries where homosexuality is illegal, and naturally I do not apply as I put my safety over research.” “I’m more restricted in terms of  where I can move to for post-doctoral work. I won’t move to a country where I can’t live freely and openly with my partner without risk of  discrimination.” “I work in a very international field. The policies of  some countries, within which we have collabora-tors, towards LGBTQ+ rights would prevent me from moving there for work.” “….we send students on attachment to observatories and experiments in other countries where they may (and sometimes do) experience LGBTQ+-based discrimination.” “My fieldwork took me to [country] and [country] where being homosexual is illegal, and concealing my sexuality was very necessary there.” Such concerns and experiences are directly linked to the issues outlines above. In a binary-gender environment where researchers are assumed to be heterosexual and cis-gendered unless corrected, where LGBTQ+ role models are largely invisible and a student may feel unable to address issues re-lated to their sexual orientation/expression and/or gender identity/expression with their supervisory team, the question of  cultural or legal attitudes in countries where students are encouraged to visit appear to remain unasked.  The international nature of  academic life is also mentioned in the context of  working in their own institution with colleagues or students from areas of  the world with a reputation for cultural hostility towards LGBTQ+: “In one instance a friend (not LGBTQ+) was working in a group on an undergraduate project where a supervisor from a LGBTQ+ [hostile] country made a negative remark in regards to a poster adver-tising an LGBTQ+ lecture… I felt neither myself  nor my friend could challenge this as the supervi-sor was responsible for his project mark.” “I teach a lot of  international students, several of  whom are quite religious. As such I do not discuss my personal life at all with students unless it becomes absolutely necessary, whereas heterosexual staff  regularly refer to their children/partners etc. which helps students to see them as a multifaceted human rather than as a one-sided individual.” There is relatively little research that explores the impact of  globalization on LGBTQ+ identities, education, and work. The results of  this questionnaire show there is an increasing need, not only for research in this area, but support and development from institutions, funders, and relevant govern-ment bodies in negotiating international work and the expectations of  researcher mobility. English & Fenby-Hulse 421 Trans- and non-binary researchers It would be inappropriate to separate out entirely the difficulties reported by students who identify as trans or non-binary; not only would that make assumptions about those students’ sexual orientation and/or identity but would also intimate that the previous themes were somehow only applicable to cis-gendered respondents. However, it is important to recognize that, emerging from the question-naire, there were experiences that were specific to trans- and non-binary students. Often these related to the reaction of  students and staff  within their institution, which ranged from a perceived awk-wardness: “I am trans, my supervisors are not trans…and as such they sometimes say the wrong thing or are a bit awkward about my situation. I can tell they want to talk to me about it or ask about it but they are worried they are going to say the wrong thing. They are not great at using my gender neutral pro-noun.” to a lack of  respect and aggression on behalf  of  the supervisor:  “[My, now former, supervisor] ignored my coming-out email, refused to use my correct pronouns, described one of  my speech mannerisms as \"a female thing\" and referred to \"people who aspire to be men\" with a pointed look at me.” Other concerns of  transgendered respondents included institutional processes and systems that were felt to be exclusionary and caused feelings of  being “othered”: “For trans students, there are a lot of  social and administrative issues associated with transitioning during a PhD: updating personal details in multiple directories can be exhausting and time-consuming, and there is the potential to be outed if  any of  those directories are missed. There are also issues associated with communicating a new name/pronouns to an entire department, some members of  which might not know the student very well but will still need the information. This also applies to external contacts made at conferences. All of  this takes up a lot of  time, energy and think-ing space, which detracts from the PhD. Medical appointments can have a similar effect, and many universities’/funders’ policies on sick leave will not be set up to accommodate medical transition.”   “[I] wasn’t sure if  the support services would be trans inclusive [and so did not use them].” “Some of  the standard binary assumptions. I had to get my ID card altered. When I first applied there were no non-binary titles to choose from and a binary gender tick box. In the Doctoral College induction, the dean gave a speech and named each school and asked the students to raise their hands if  they were in that school. As she named the school she began to count the students with raised hands and make comments about the gender division. She commented how great it was that there were an equal number of  women to men when she called out [faculty]. I was dreading her getting to [faculty] in case I was publicly misgendered.” These observations mirror some of  the findings of  the report by McKendry and Lawrence (2017) that examined the experience of  trans and gender diverse applicants, students and staff  in Scotland’s colleges and universities. While connections in terms of  experience can be made with the general student and staff  trans and non-binary populations, there is the potential that issues may be exacer-bated for doctoral researchers given their positioning in between the undergraduate and the institu-tional research community.  Visibility The final theme recurred throughout the responses to the questionnaire, but in particular to the be-low questions: • Are there any other situations outside of  your academic institution [but within academia] in which you have felt uncomfortable or felt that you had to conceal your sexual orienta-tion/expression and/or your gender identity/expression? Documenting Diversity 422 • Do you feel your sexual orientation/expression and/or your gender identity/expression will have an effect on your future career? • What, if  anything, would you like your institution to do to improve the experience of  LGBTQ+ doctoral research students? For some respondents, a lack of  visible LGBTQ+ role models within either their discipline or insti-tution contributed to a perception of  academia as lacking when it came to diversity and inclusion: “I want to see successful professors who identified himself/herself. I want to listen to their experi-ence. I want to listen to successful professors who are LGBTs. I want an inspiration.” “Visibility is key. More needs to be done to support doctoral students coming out - if  they want to. This can best be done by improving the visibility of  other LGBTQ+ role models in doctoral study and in academia more generally.” “I wish I knew who the other queers are. Especially among faculty. I know it’s a personal matter, but it would make me feel so much better to know there are queer academics in my white-cis-male field.” The importance of  female role models or mentors in breaking down masculine norms and assump-tions in the workplace and encouraging women to pursue careers in traditionally male-dominated fields has been long established (Bizzari, 1995). That such principles related to LGBTQ+ career pro-gression was raised by several respondents. One of  the suggestions here was that without visible LGBTQ+ role models, a message was being sent to LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers that to progress with your career meant fitting into established institutional and cultural norms: “I am only aware of  one other LGBTQ+ person in my department and it is not something we have ever discussed in the workplace. As such, there is a complete absence of  any LGBTQ+ role models for our students, thus perpetuating the notion that to be successful we should blend in.” It has been shown that increased LGBTQ+ visibility through role model and mentoring programs can positively impact on the professional development of  LGBTQ+ individuals as well as on their health and wellbeing (Bird, Kuhns, & Garofalo, 2012; Colgan, 2012; McAllister, Ahmedani, Harold, & Cramer, 2009; Renn, 2010; Schneider & Dimito, 2010). When respondents were asked if  there were LGBTQ+ role models at their institution who they were able to contact and would feel com-fortable speaking with about any issues or experiences pertaining to their sexual orienta-tion/expression and/or your gender identity/expression, equal numbers of  respondents (60) said that there were and that there were not. For the majority, though, the response was that they were not sure if  there were any, suggesting visibility is a key determinant here. Only 18 respondents confirmed that they had made contact with a person in their institution who they saw as a role model in this way.  CONCLUSION  This study sought to better understand the experience of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers and to de-termine whether any reported challenges were unique to this group. In relation to the first of  these, while many LGBTQ+ doctoral students felt they were studying in a supportive institution, the study highlighted a diverse range of  inclusivity issues as well as direct instances of  homophobic and/or transphobic behavior (experienced by just over half  of  our respondents). For many of  the respond-ents, the challenges they faced were not simply a result of  overt or explicit aggression towards them, but rather by a feeling of  exclusion from a dominant heteronormative or cis-normative culture within their institution or local research environment. Repeatedly, the study revealed feelings of  frustration at having to actively and repeatedly make the decision to challenge such assumptions and to educate others. This was exacerbated for transgendered students by a culture or administrative processes that were reportedly unprepared to accommodate anyone whose gender identity was not the same as writ-ten on their birth certificate.  English & Fenby-Hulse 423 The tension between understandings of  the personal and the professional within academic life re-curred throughout the responses. For some the dividing line between their sexual orientation (‘per-sonal life’) and their doctoral studies (‘professional life’) was clear and they believed their sexual ori-entation or gender identity was irrelevant to their academic life. However, when respondents did re-port challenges, feelings of  exclusion or outright prejudice this was often a result of  a blurring or tension between the personal and the professional that they were not able to control or manage; in-cluding issues such as everyday conversations which touched on life outside work and international travel. This was, perhaps, even more keenly felt by the trans- respondents who had faced issues rang-ing from pronoun use and gendered facilities/systems to direct experiences of  transphobia. Clearly delineating between the personal and the professional is a privilege that only some within the acade-my are able to enact. It is clear that senior staff  play an important role in either enabling or challeng-ing cultures of  exclusion. The position of  the doctoral researcher within the academic hierarchy can make it difficult for those affected to challenge discriminatory behavior and macroaggressions from colleagues, supervisors, and the institution. For most of  our respondents, their sexual orientation or gender identity had little or no impact on their relationship with their supervisor, and a few reported it having a positive influence. For others, however, there still was a concern that revealing their identity or orientation to their supervisor(s) could have a negative consequences on their experience or future career and, as such, found them-selves unable to act or speak freely about different aspects of  their lives.  The difficulties inherent in being a LGBTQ+ doctoral researcher in an international academic envi-ronment was a regular theme. Recurrent were worries of  having to present at conferences or conduct field work in areas of  the world where homosexuality is illegal or discrimination is perceived as being commonplace.  As far as the second aim of  this study – whether any of  these challenges are unique to this cohort – is concerned, it must be recognized that few, if  any, of  these issues are exclusive to doctoral study. However, the position of  the PhD student as the most junior member of  a department, often at the start of  their career and heavily dependent on a supervisor or supervisory team puts the individual in a vulnerable position that can lead to them feeling powerless when excluded by the dominant culture. In that context, with the acknowledgment of  the positive experience of  many of  respondents, it is important to continue to develop an understanding not only of  the challenges that face those who identify as LGBTQ+, but also an understanding of  what these diverse voices bring to research and the academy. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS  Given doctoral researchers (and in particular certain subsets of  this community) can be considered hard-to-reach populations, it cannot be stated with confidence that the experiences presented here are representative and not experienced to a greater or lesser extent within the wider population. Throughout we have avoided statistical analysis and a focus on trends to instead focus on contrast, diversity and experience. Nevertheless, it needs to be noted that this study focuses solely on UK ex-periences and those who were willing and able to complete a lengthy online questionnaire. While the use of  an anonymous online questionnaire enabled those who may have felt uncomfortable with at-tending interviews or focus groups to participate, this approach will no doubt have excluded some and also meant it was not possible for the research team to clarify answers or explore them in more depth.  This study, though, provides a deep insight into the experiences of  doctoral researchers who identify as LGBTQ+ and is strengthened by the high and diverse response rate. Through an interpretative phenomenological analysis, contextualized within the wider literature, it has been possible not only to identify emergent themes that occurred across the responses, but to also highlight particularities and Documenting Diversity 424 moments of  polarization, conflict and tension, all of  which are important when considering diversity initiatives to support doctoral study. RECOMMENDATIONS A number of  recommendations can be made as a result of  this study. There is certainly a need for a critical examination of  the systems and spaces in which doctoral education takes place and the im-plementation of  systems and spaces that are inclusive. There is a need for all those involved in doc-toral education (whether students, peers, supervisors, or professional and support staff) to have an understanding of  1) legal obligations pertaining to equality; 2) the diverse experiences of  LGBTQ+ researchers and what diversity brings to the research endeavor; and 3) the effect micro-aggressions can have on those that identify as LGBTQ+ and how this type of  behavior or act can be better ad-dressed. There is also a particularly strong need to think about the transnational research environ-ments in which doctoral researchers work and how this can impact on networking, career develop-ment, and research opportunities (drawing on resources such as Stonewall’s (2017) Safe Travels: Global Mobility for LGBT Staff). Finally, there is a need for better visibility, better representation, and better mentoring. LGBTQ+ role models can provide guidance and support and show pathways for becom-ing a successful and international LGBTQ+ researcher. For smaller institutions and disciplines this may be more difficult, so this is a pressing need for the establishment of  regional and national net-works and mentoring programs to ensure that no matter what or where a person studies there is ac-cess to a robust support network. This study offers a ‘campus climate’ study (Renn, 2010), providing a much-needed insight into the experiences of  doctoral researchers in the UK in 2017. The study also provides an evidence base for future research on the relationship between doctoral education and diversity. Indeed, there is poten-tial scope for future studies to focus specifically on issues of  intersectionality, disciplinary differences, health and wellbeing, representation, voice, and agency, as well as productivity, attainment, and career development of  LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers. There is also scope for similar studies to focus on other protected characteristics to obtain a fuller understanding of  the diverse experiences of  doctoral researchers and to determine what could constitute inclusive doctoral education. Indeed, as the de-mographic of  the doctoral researcher population diversifies, it is increasingly important that our ap-proach to doctoral education and the systems and processes that underpin doctoral education are adapted to meet the needs of  that diverse population. Approaches, systems and processes that ex-clude or marginalize particular groups, could indirectly impact on the shape of  the research work-force both within and outside of  Higher Education. As such, this study is not only timely, but im-portant in terms of  diversity of  future doctoral populations as well as the jobs these researchers go on to. REFERENCES Ahmed, S. (2006).

    "abstract": "Aim/Purpose: This article provides a much needed insight into the experiences of doctoral researchers in the UK that identify as Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Trans-, Queer, or outside of heteronormative or cis-normative identities (LGBTQ+) to address the question of what support, culture, and pedagogy might better support doc-toral researchers who identify as LGBTQ+. Background: While experiences of LGBTQ+ students in UK Higher Education have been explored in recent studies, the experiences of doctoral students have not been differentiated, documented, or analyzed. Methodology: Through an online questionnaire sent to UK institutions, this study captures and reflects on the diverse experiences of doctoral education. The study took a predominantly phenomenological approach, placing the focus on understanding how individual researchers experienced their working environment. Contribution: This questionnaire offers a 'campus climate' study, providing a much-needed insight into the experiences of doctoral researchers in the UK in 2017. The study also highlights the importance of acknowledging the diversity of doctoral researchers and adapting supervisory and institutional support to meet the dif-fering needs of doctoral researchers. It considers themes such as the impact of the working environment, experiences of macroaggressions and harassment, the need for researchers to work internationally, and the visibility of role mod-els. The complex nature of the supervisor-student relationship is also consid-ered throughout. Findings: Although many LGBTQ+ doctoral students felt they were studying in a sup-portive institution, the questionnaire highlights a diverse range of inclusivity issues as well as direct instances of homophobic and/or transphobic behavior. Recommendations for Practitioners: From this questionnaire, it is concluded that there is a need for a critical exami-nation of systems and spaces in which doctoral education takes place and the implementation of systems and spaces that are inclusive. There is a need for all those involved in doctoral education to understand how identifying as a LGBTQ+ researcher can impact on your experience of doctoral education. And, finally, there is a need for better LGBTQ+ visibility, better representation, and better mentoring. Recommendations for Researchers: If doctoral education is to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse workforce, research needs to take into account the views and experiences of minority and marginalized groups that may challenge or be in tension with the views of the larger research population. Impact on Society: As the demographic of the doctoral researcher population diversifies, it is in-creasingly important that our approach to doctoral education and the systems and processes that underpin doctoral education are adapted to meet the needs of that diverse population. Future Research: There is potential scope for future studies to focus specifically on issues of in-tersectionality, disciplinary differences, health and wellbeing, representation, voice, and agency, as well as productivity, attainment, and career development of LGBTQ+ doctoral researchers.</p",
