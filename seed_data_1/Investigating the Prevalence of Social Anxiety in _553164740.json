The dearth of information around the prevalence and impact of social anxiety on the college population and the LGB population is important because social anxiety is known to be prevalent and chronic, affecting all areas of an individual’s life, but especially impacting the creation of social support networks and therefore access to social supports. Social support is one of the primary protective factors and promoters of resilience among all people, especially in marginalized communities like the LGBTQ community. Knowing that such a prevalent disorder is common among these populations and affects one of the main factors contributing to those individuals’ ability to adjust successfully and to their well-being, comes with the responsibility of better understanding that disorder, its impact on that population, and how to intervene to reduce assuage its negative effects. This project reviewed prevalence rates of social anxiety disorder (SAD) among the college student population and the LGB population to estimate the prevalence of SAD within the LGB college student population. This project also explored the risk factors of SAD for college students and LGB people to investigate the risk factors of SAD for LGB college students. Finally, this project reviewed protective factors and prevention strategies for SAD among LGB people to consider the clinical application for LGB college students, including therapeutic, social, and community interventions. Clinical implications and recommendations for future research are included.    ii  INVESTIGATING THE PREVALENCE OF SOCIAL ANXIETY IN LGB COLLEGE STUDENTS                                    Copyright ©2022   Brianna Barnes-Harrington  All rights reserved   iii  DEDICATION This project is dedicated to my incredible, amazing wife and all that we have lost along this journey.

bisexual (LGB) population, which refers to the community of individuals who identify as sexual minorities, often experiences barriers and difficulties in everyday life. These barriers and difficulties include experiences such as social stress, minority stress (e.g., discrimination/prejudice), overt stigmatization, internalized homonegativity/homophobia, stigma consciousness, and sexual orientation concealment (Alessi, 2014; Cox et al., 2010). In consideration of these challenges to the everyday lives of LGB individuals, this project examines the role and impact of social anxiety disorder (SAD) in the lives of LGB individuals, particularly exploring the prevalence of social anxiety in young adulthood among LGB college students and the potential risks and protective factors that may affect these students. Understanding Minority Stress Sexual minority individuals are exposed to and affected by stress primarily related to their sexual orientation while living in a world that is predominantly heterosexual, with organization and structure set up based upon heterosexual attraction and gender roles (Rotheram-Borus & Langabeer, 2001).  It is important to define some of these stressors, including minority stress, internalized homonegativity/homophobia, stigma consciousness, and sexual orientation concealment. The minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003) asserts that the chronic stress faced by minority individuals, including sexual minorities, as a result of stigma, prejudice, and discrimination related to their identity can lead to an increased risk of health problems. Minority stress is related to the otherness and oppression that nonheterosexual individuals continually experience from existing within the norms and structures meant for a heterosexual-centric society (Woodford et 2   al., 2015). LGB individuals are more likely to report lifetime and day-to-day experiences of discrimination and that these experiences of discrimination made their lives more difficult, including challenging their ability to lead a full and productive life, compared to heterosexual individuals (Mays & Cochran, 2001). Individuals reporting lifetime or day-to-day experiences of discrimination had significantly increased odds of having a psychiatric disorder, low ratings of current mental health, and high psychological distress (Mays & Cochran, 2001). LGB individuals also experience internalized stressors such as internalized homonegativity/homophobia, which occurs when the negative attitudes and stereotypes of sexual minority orientations from the broader heterosexual culture are internalized by the individual toward themselves and others in the LGB community (Cox et al., 2010). There also appears to be a relationship between internalized homonegativity and depression, self-esteem, and psychological distress (Alessi, 2014; Cox et al., 2010; DiPlacido, 1998; Meyer, 1995, 2001, 2003; Shidlo, 1994; Vanden Berghe et al., 2010). Stigma consciousness refers to “the extent to which people expect to be stereotyped by others” (Cox et al., 2010, p. 1201) due to the awareness of their own possession of a stigma or difference from others or society that is considered undesirable (Pinel, 1999). The more someone is aware of themselves as stigmatized, the more important it may be to anticipate being stereotyped, which can negatively affect an LGB individual’s health, psychological, and social functioning (Cox et al., 2010). Sexual orientation concealment and general self-concealment may increase LGB individuals’ risk for developing mental health concerns. Self-concealment can be defined as actively hiding personal information that could be emotionally distressing or embarrassing (Leleux-Labarge et al., 2015). Concealing sexual orientation can range from engaging in subtle 3   efforts of impression management that allow one’s orientation to be unnoticeable to overtly declaring a heterosexual identity (J. M. Cohen et al., 2016). It is operationally defined as the “lack of disclosure,” “lack of open behavior,” “lack of general openness,” and “lack of public knowledge” about one’s sexual orientation with others (Pachankis et al., 2020, p. 833). Sexual minorities are at an increased risk for overall psychological distress and psychopathology (Cochran & Mays, 2000; King et al., 2008; Kirsch et al., 2015; McAleavey et al., 2011). It has been found that LGB individuals are more likely to experience a mood or anxiety disorder than their heterosexual counterparts (Bostwick et al., 2010), and LGB college students experience greater psychological distress and decreased social well-being during the first year of undergraduate studies compared to heterosexual peers (Kirsch et al., 2015). Research has demonstrated that LGB individuals face many factors that can lead to increased stress and mental health difficulties (Alessi, 2014; Anderson et al., 2015; Bostwick et al., 2010; Cox et al., 2010; Kirsch et al., 2015; Leleux-Labarge et al., 2015; Mays & Cochran, 2001; Pachankis et al., 2020; Safren & Pantalone, 2006; Woodford et al., 2015). Growing up in a predominantly heterosexual society can begin to impact LGB individuals from early adolescence well into adulthood (Kirsch et al., 2015; Safren & Pantalone, 2006; Woodford et al., 2015). The transition to adulthood, specifically college life, is also stressful for most young adults, even when they have the needed support and resources (Kirsch et al., 2015). As LGB individuals may be at risk for developing SAD due to the nature of their experiences in the world around them (Bostwick et al., 2010; Kirsch et al., 2015) and the potential barrier that SAD could be for those individuals (Safren & Pantalone, 2006) in being able to adjust and build the supports needed to be successful in college, it would seem to emphasize that this is an important area to understand. 4   Social Anxiety Disorder SAD, a fear in social situations that often leads to social avoidance (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013), may be an added barrier for some LGB individuals. SAD is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; APA, 2013) as “marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others” (p. 202), as well as the fear that while in these situations their behavior or anxiety will lead to negative evaluation, potential embarrassment, or possible rejection by others. This causes these social situations to provoke a disproportionate amount of fear or anxiety within the individual, leading them to either avoid social situations or suffer from intense fear or anxiety for the duration of the situation. To diagnose this disorder, the individual must have experienced fear, anxiety, and avoidance over at least 6 months. The fear and anxiety must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning (APA, 2013). According to the DSM-5, the United States 12-month prevalence rate of SAD is approximately 7% (APA, 2013). This corresponds to the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) findings, which identified a 6.8% 12-month-prevalence of social phobia in the general population (Kessler et al., 2005). The National Comorbidity Survey found lifetime prevalence rates of SAD to be 13.3% (Magee et al., 1996). While SAD is considered a prevalent disorder with a chronic course and an early onset (APA, 2013; Furmark, 2002), there is very limited research and information on its prevalence and impact on college students generally. In the general population, SAD rates are higher among women than men, ranging from 1.5 to 2.2 times more likely for women, with the difference being more prominent among adolescents and young adults (APA, 2013). In the United States, the median age of onset is 13 years, with 75% of individuals experiencing onset between age 8 5   and 15 (APA, 2013). The onset of SAD may emerge from a history of social inhibition or shyness in childhood, following a stressful or humiliating experience, or after significant life changes associated with new social roles (APA, 2013). How SAD manifests can vary based upon the age of the individual, with adolescents endorsing a broad range of fear and avoidance across many situations; young adults expressing higher levels of situation-specific anxiety; and older adults expressing lower levels of social anxiety across a wider variety of situations (APA, 2013). The course of SAD can vary and tends to be particularly persistent for individuals who present for treatment (APA, 2013). In the community, remission of symptoms occurs for about 30% of individuals with SAD in one year and for approximately 50% of individuals within a few years (APA, 2013). Without SAD-specific treatment, symptom remission can take several years or more for around 60% of individuals with SAD (APA, 2013). SAD is a heritable disorder, which increases the likelihood of first-degree relatives also having SAD (APA, 2013). Behavioral inhibition and fear of negative evaluation are two traits that can predispose individuals to SAD, both of which are strongly influenced by one’s genetics and influenced by the gene-environment interaction (APA, 2013). The importance of understanding the prevalence and impact of SAD on college students can be seen in the growing number of studies examining it in many countries around the world (Ahmad et al., 2017; Bella & Omigbodun, 2009; Desalegn et al., 2019; Kuder & Grover, 2014; Parade et al., 2010; Pshyk et al., 2019; Reta et al., 2020; Russell & Shaw, 2009; Seim & Spates, 2010; Strahan, 2003; Tillfors & Furmark, 2007). 6   Social Anxiety in the LGB Population Knowing that SAD can have a significant impact on functioning for the general college student emphasizes the potential for a compounding impact on LGB students as well. An important consequence of having SAD is that it could limit the individual’s willingness or ability to seek out social supports and engage in positive activities, which is important, as social support is likely a protective factor for LGB individuals (Safren & Pantalone, 2006). Social anxiety is significantly and negatively associated with social support (Potoczniak et al., 2007). Safren and Pantalone (2006) suggested that social anxiety itself may be a barrier for LGB individuals in creating and building social supports and partaking in social events because the fear and avoidance of social interactions associated with social anxiety and the pressures faced by LGB individuals to hide their sexual orientation and conform to heterosexual norms may limit their ability to form satisfying and supportive relationships with their peers. Link and Phelan (2001) indicated that connecting stereotypes of certain groups of people, such as individuals labeled with mental illness like SAD, to negative or undesirable characteristics, often leads to stigma and separation of that group from others “through loss of status, discrimination, and differences in social, economic, and political power” (Anderson et al., 2015, p. 131; Link & Phelan, 2001). LGB individuals may have increased chances of experiencing peer-related social anxiety as they may perceive themselves as different in a way that is typically rejected by peers (Safren & Pantalone, 2006). Statement of Problem Compared to their heterosexual peers, LGB college students are at an elevated risk for mental health issues, including social anxiety, due in part to their minority status and the corresponding stress (Bostwick et al., 2010; Kirsch et al., 2015). Social anxiety could be a barrier 7   to LGB students’ ability to adjust to college, connect with peer supports, and reach out for assistance (Safren & Pantalone, 2006). However, current research tells us little about SAD among college-age individuals and even less about college-age LGB individuals. This paper strives to investigate the prevalence of social anxiety in LGB college students. Understanding the prevalence of SAD among college-age LGB individuals, the barriers and risk factors for this population, and how they can be supported through this transitional time may allow for the reduction or prevention of the development of SAD and allow these individuals to manage the stressors of college successfully and reach their goals. This project primarily refers to the LGB community, versus the broader lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and others (LGBTQ+) umbrella terminology, due to the acknowledgement that there are different experiences between sexual minorities and gender minorities. While individuals who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming are affected by some of the same stressors as sexual minorities, it is understood that additional intersectional layers add complexity to their challenges and deserve their own direct focus. At times, this paper may refer to specific groups within the larger LGBTQ community or use varying specifiers to identify the community, such as LGB, LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQ+, and LGBTQIA+. These differences in language will be solely based on the language used by researchers, as there is much variance across research in how they defined and referred to the broader community or the specific group they studied. Due to the comprehensive nature of this paper, some older research uses terms that are no longer used within the LGBTQIA+ community; these terms are only used in reference to those specific studies. 8   Purpose of the Study The purpose of this literature review is to examine the gap in the research on social anxiety among LGB college students and highlight the potential implications for this population. Research Questions and Hypotheses 1. What is the prevalence of social anxiety among LGB college students? As research tends to report a higher prevalence rate of social anxiety and other psychological disorders among LGB individuals, it is hypothesized that LGB college students will also report higher rates of social anxiety than their heterosexual peers. 2. What are contributing factors to social anxiety among LGB college students? It is hypothesized that factors that contribute to social anxiety among LGB college students will be an intersection of those factors that contribute to social anxiety for other LGB individuals and other college students, such as identity development, social support, minority stress, and significant life transitions. 3. What factors can facilitate resilience and prevent or protect LGB college students from developing social anxiety? The hypothesis is that the preventative or protective factors of social anxiety for LGB college students will be an intersection of factors that are preventative or protective for LGB individuals and college students overall, such as perceived social support, increased supports on college campuses, accessible resources targeted to this specific population, integrated programming in the orientation process, and reduced stigma surrounding LGB community and mental health overall. Research Procedure The variables to be researched include social anxiety, college-age students, and the LGB-identified population. The research questions were evaluated by examining current research on 9   social anxiety among LGB college students, social anxiety overall, social anxiety within the LGB community, and social anxiety among college-age students in general. The databases used to search for existing research literature included EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, PsycNET, ResearchGate, and research also acquired from referenced articles in the results of these searches. The search terms utilized included social anxiety and LGB and college student, social anxiety and LGB, social anxiety among LGB, social anxiety and LGBT, social anxiety among LGBT, social phobia among LGBT, rates of social anxiety among LGB, prevalence of social phobia among LGBT, sexual minority and social anxiety, prevalence of SAD, risk factors for LGB individuals, barriers to resilience LGB, barriers to help seeking LGB, LGB* college students, LGB* university, SAD or social phobia and lesbian, SAD or social phobia and bisexual, SAD or social phobia and college students or university students, SAD or social phobia and prevalence, protective factors for social anxiety, determinants of social anxiety. Factors of inclusion for journal articles were papers that included social anxiety, LGB, LGBT, any one subgroup of the LGBT community, academic journals, full text, scholarly (peer-reviewed) journals, and availability in the English language. Factors of exclusion for journal articles were papers where the primary focus of the research was not related directly to the variables of interest.   10   CHAPTER II: THE PREVALENCE OF SOCIAL ANXIETY AMONG LGB COLLEGE STUDENTS The literature suggests a high prevalence of social anxiety among college students in general (Nordstrom et al., 2014) and among the LGB population in particular (Bostwick et al., 2010). However, there is a gap in our knowledge about the prevalence of social anxiety among LGB college students. The presence of social anxiety in LGB college students is important to consider when thinking about its impact on these students during the formative, transitional period of college. This chapter explores more about the prevalence of social anxiety in LGB college students. Due to the dearth of information and research on this specific intersection of the LGB and college populations, research on both populations separately was considered to inform the potential prevalence of LGB college students. As research tends to report a higher prevalence rate of social anxiety and other psychological disorders among LGB individuals, it was hypothesized that LGB college students experience higher rates of social anxiety than their heterosexual peers. It was also hypothesized that LGB college students experience social anxiety at a prevalence rate similar to the LGB population in general. SAD in College Students To begin the investigation into the prevalence of social anxiety among LGB college students, the prevalence of social anxiety among college students in general was examined first. Specific research into the prevalence of SAD in college students in the United States is limited, although there appears to be a consensus that it is common, with a prevalence of high or clinical levels of social anxiety between 19-33% of college students (Parade et al., 2010). Overall, most research on SAD among the college population has been completed in other countries around the 11   world, though two studies were completed in the United States that did report the prevalence of social anxiety in their participant sample (Kuder & Grover, 2014; Strahan, 2003). Strahan (2003) examined the effects of social anxiety and social skills on the academic performance of first-year university students in the United States. The purpose of this study was to examine what role, if any, high-trait social anxiety plays in an individual’s undergraduate academic career. The researchers randomly selected 1600 first-year students who were contacted with an invitation to participate in the study during the first two weeks of classes via campus and U.S. mail. Over 800 of the invited students registered to participate via the response portion of the invitation. Ultimately, only 16% of the invited sample participated in the study, with 253 students completing the assessments. The authors indicated the sample reflected the composition of the campus, with 200 European-American students, 22 Asian-American students, 15 African American students, 9 Hispanic American students, and 2 students who identified as other. The gender of the students was not provided (Strahan, 2003). This study used several measures to assess the variables of social anxiety, social competence, and academic persistence. The Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI; Turner et al., 1989) is a measure of social anxiety where participants endorse a response to statements describing anxiety in certain social situations on a seven-point scale ranging from “never” to “always.” The authors used the SPAI Social Phobia subscale to investigate the degree of social anxiety within the sample using cutoffs of 90 for women and 100 for men based on previous research. The authors used the Social Skills Inventory (SSI; Riggio, 1986), a social competence inventory containing 90 items, to measure the social competence of the sample. On the SSI, participants respond using a five-point scale ranging from ‘1 = Not at all like me” to “5 = 12   Exactly like me.” The authors assessed the sample’s academic persistence using a 13-item measure, the adapted College Affiliation Questionnaire (Cabrera et al., 1993). The participants completed the measures for the study during the first 4 to 6 weeks of classes in small group testing sessions with 4 to 15 students. As included in the initial informed consent for the study, the researchers completed a follow-up data collection to access student records for grade point average (GPA) and enrollment for two years after the study began, as these were the variables they were intending to predict. As part of the study, they examined the prevalence of clinical levels of social anxiety among the participants (Strahan, 2003). Based on the social phobia scale of the SPAI, results indicated a 22% prevalence rate of social anxiety among this sample of college students (Strahan, 2003). The authors noted that this prevalence rate could be somewhat larger than the actual prevalence due to the potential overrepresentation of women in the sample, as reports of social anxiety tend to be higher among women than men. However, they found this prevalence rate similar to the one in another study at a large university (Turner et al., 1989). The authors cited prevalence rates found in prior research, including one study by Beidel et al. (1989), which found 19% of the sample of undergraduate students met the criteria for social phobia and another study by Strahan and Conger (1998) in which social phobia symptoms were reported by 33% of a sample of undergraduate men. The primary purpose of this study was not to determine the prevalence of social anxiety in the student population, and the final sample size was small for that purpose. However, the study had the potential to be a large study on the first-year student population. It is important to keep the sample size and small numbers of minority groups in mind when considering the generalizability of the results found in this study, as well as the very low response rate of the 13   invited students, because all these factors limit the generalizability of the results from the study. With a 16% participation rate, the students who participated in the study may possess certain qualities that led them to participate compared to those who did not. The authors did explore differences between the students in their sample and nonparticipant students in the Registrar database in terms of gender and academic variables, finding that the group in the study may be “somewhat more academically talented . . . more female. . . [and] persist in somewhat greater numbers” (Strahan, 2003, p. 353) than the general first-year student population of this cohort. Acknowledging the limited generalizability for a small sample size, even with limited power, the study found a significant effect, which might be seen in larger studies if replicated (Strahan, 2003). Another study (Kuder & Grover, 2014) examined the performance of socially anxious college students from a mid-Atlantic Jesuit university while they were observed in a conversation with a friend. The perception of the student’s own social performance was used to examine perceived social competencies and observable behaviors of social anxiety. The study was conducted through convenience sampling of 54 undergraduate students through a university psychology department. The only requirements for participation were being aged 18 to 21 and currently enrolled in college. Participants volunteered through the psychology department research portal and received credit in introductory psychology courses in return for their participation. The participants were 70% women and 85% White, 7% Asian/Pacific Islander, 6% Hispanic, and 2% Black. Participants were between 18 and 21, with a mean age of 18.65 (Kuder & Grover, 2014). During the study, participants and a friend of their choice were directed to a room with two chairs and a video camera, where they were left alone. Each participant was instructed to 14   have a 10-minute conversation with their friend about something they would like to change about themselves. This conversation was videotaped. Their conversations were assessed using the Social Performance Rating Scale (SPRS; Fydrich et al., 1998), a system used to evaluate social skills through rated observed behaviors. Individuals are rated on five behavioral indicators of anxiety: gaze, discomfort, vocal quality, length of contribution, and flow of conversation. Ratings are completed on a 5-point Likert scale. In this study, gaze was not rated due to some visibility concerns with lighting on the videotapes. The raters were two trained undergraduate students (Kuder & Grover, 2014). Following the conversation, participants completed an online survey that included a demographic questionnaire and assessments to evaluate social anxiety and interpersonal competence. The study used the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A; La Greca & Lopez, 1998) to assess social anxiety. The SAS-A is a self-report measure where participants rate 22 statements on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (all the time). This assessment provides an overall social anxiety score along with three subscale scores for fear of negative evaluation, social anxiety and distress in new situations, and social anxiety and distress in general. The Interpersonal Competence Questionnaire (ICQ; Buhrmester et al., 1988) is a 40-item rating scale developed to assess college students’ competency in close friendships and romantic relationships. It evaluates five domains: initiating relationships, self-disclosure, providing emotional support, negative assertion, and conflict management. Items are rated on a scale from one (poor; uncomfortable) to five (extremely good; very comfortable). After each item, participants rate their perception of their own competencies and their comfort levels with a same-sex and a different-sex friend or romantic partner. The authors used Pearson correlations to 15   explore whether social anxiety was related to ratings of observed performance and perception of social competence (Kuder & Grover, 2014). The study found that 48.1% of participants had significant social anxiety, based upon analysis of SAS-A scores with total score cutoffs of 44. Additionally, they found general social anxiety was significantly negatively correlated with two of the observed social performance behaviors (comfort and length) and perceived general interpersonal competencies. Individuals with higher social anxiety reported lower social competencies, displayed less comfort, and provided very short or long additions to the conversation. In general, it appears that students who are socially anxious tended to have more negative perceptions of their social competencies than peers who were not anxious, and these young adults seemed to demonstrate deficits in performance in conversations (Kuder & Grover, 2014). The generalizability of this study appears to be fairly limited as it was a small study with only 54 participants. The participants were primarily White, female, undergraduate psychology students, and the use of convenience sampling may not have allowed for a representative sample of the student population at this university, let alone of the college student population at large. There are also limits on the generalizability, particularly for minority students, as the sample was homogenous and not representative of the general population, though it may be representative of that school or area. For example, the experience of one Black student (2% in the study) cannot be generalized to any broader group. Additionally, this study was part of a larger study examining the link between psychopathology in young adults and their social relationships, which seems to be even more of a convenience sampling. It is unclear whether they are examining data that initially had another purpose or if all the data were collected and included with this study in mind from the beginning. This could have made their sample even more limited than if subjects were 16   recruited specifically for this study. The demographics questionnaire was fairly limited, limiting the factors that can be examined in the study, though the sample size was likely too small for between comparisons regardless (Kuder & Grover, 2014). Conversely, the mean age of participants was 18.65, which is representative of first-year college students who would be in the middle of making the transition into college. It could be useful to look specifically at students transitioning into college, as they are likely the most at risk regarding the consequences of social anxiety impacting their success and experience. This could be a significant time when support and prevention for students could be most impactful. Additionally, the findings of “significant social anxiety” for participants were not based explicitly on the diagnostic criteria for SAD, which could mean that the study may not be measuring the same clinical construct, though this may be unlikely due to the support for the construct validity of the assessment in previous research. A potential challenge in this study, particularly with a socially anxious population, was the use of self-report measures, which may have been affected by social desirability, leading to underreporting of symptoms, minimization of problems, or increased competence levels. Nevertheless, the research study and its findings are still relevant in that they were working with the college student population and examining the experience and impact of social anxiety on students (Kuder & Grover, 2014). One study examined the prevalence of social phobia among students at a Swedish university (Tillfors & Furmark, 2007). In addition to prevalence among university students, the authors wanted to investigate the association between avoidant behavior in anticipation of public speaking and SAD, examine any demographic features that may be more prevalent with SAD, and compare prevalence rates of SAD among university students to that of the general Swedish population. A postal survey was sent to a sample of 753 university students in Sweden randomly 17   selected via a student-based registry from two universities. Students were chosen from three strata of the total student population—natural science/technique, social science/humanistic, and pedagogic programs. Selected students were in their fourth semester, which was chosen to minimize the influence of non-social-phobia-related factors, such as choosing the wrong program of study. Separate sampling by sex was used due to unequal distribution in the total population and each stratum. A diagnostic questionnaire, a separate identification sheet, and a letter explaining the objectives of the study were mailed to the selected participants. Two reminders were mailed to non-responders over five weeks. Ten students could not be reached by mail, 2 students were abroad and could not respond, and an additional 218 students did not respond. In total, 523 student responses (69.5%) were interpretable. The sample consisted of 178 men and 345 women ages 18-60 (Tillfors & Furmark, 2007). Measures used included the Social Phobia Screening Questionnaire (SPSQ; Furmark et al., 1999) to assess social phobia, and the Swedish versions of the Social Phobia Scale (SPS; Heimberg et al., 1992) and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS; Heimberg et al., 1992) were used to validate the clusters of clinically identified subgroups within social phobia. Additional information was gathered with questions about parental history, sociodemographic data, personal information, educational program, and location/county where participants grew up. Participants were also asked if fear of speaking in front of an audience led them to avoid an educational situation to assess for public speaking avoidance. The authors established a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed; DSM-IV; APA, 1994) diagnosis of social phobia using the diagnostic section of the SPSQ. For this measure, participants were asked to rate the amount of distress on a scale from 0 (no distress) to 4 (severe distress) caused by 14 possibly phobic scenarios. Following that, six diagnostic questions were asked to 18   determine if the participant fit criteria A-D of DSM-IV social phobia in one or more of the scenarios. To assess E-criterion, the requirement that the avoidance, anxiety, or distress interferes with the person’s ability to function; the participant was asked three yes or no questions to determine if the social discomfort was significant enough to significantly interfere with or bother them in their work, school, leisure, or social activities (Tillfors & Furmark, 2007). The researchers were most interested in the prevalence results of the current study, which found 16.1% of participants met the criteria for social phobia. The authors reported that this rate did not differ from the Swedish general population prevalence rate of 15.6% for social phobia. Those prevalence rates are moderately higher than the estimated 7% 12-month prevalence rate of SAD in the United States (APA, 2013). The researchers also contacted 86 individuals who did not respond to the initial invitation, of which 86 responded and completed a short interview of the SPSQ. Of these 86 respondents, 33 (38.4%) met the impairment criteria, leading the researchers to conclude that the non-responders were more impaired than the individuals who participated in the full study. They indicated that this might mean the 16.1% prevalence of SAD among Swedish university students may be an underestimation (Tillfors & Furmark, 2007). Overall, the study was very thorough and addressed many of the challenges of previous research using random sampling and diagnostic criteria for assessment. While the total number of participants is high, the number with social phobia is lower. This is consistent with a prevalence rate of less than 20%, but it may make it more difficult to gain an understanding or make inferences or correlations about those who do meet the criteria as a group since there are very few of them compared to the overall number of participants. The generalizability of the study is limited because even though the students were randomly selected, the two universities were not randomly selected, and approximately 30% of the student sample did not respond, 19   which means that the results may not be generalizable to all university students in Sweden. Additionally, the authors suggested that their study may underestimate the prevalence of social anxiety, as the completed attrition analysis indicated that non-responders might be more impaired than those who participated in the study. The use of self-report measures may limit the accuracy of the diagnostic tools or data collected, as participants may demonstrate bias by either reporting in a socially desirable manner, inaccurately assessing themselves, misunderstanding or misinterpreting the questions, or having a tendency for neutral or extreme response ratings. For these reasons, the assessment of social anxiety may be considered indicative of social anxiety versus akin to a formal diagnosis. It is worth noting that in this paper the authors talked about subgroups of social phobia and referring to the DSM-III, when DSM-IV was introduced in 1994, approximately 13 years prior to the study. It is unclear why they are using the term social phobia instead of SAD, especially as they were utilizing the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, which are much broader than the DSM-III disorder of social phobia. This raises the need for consideration in ensuring that the constructs being measured, instruments used for measurement, and the overall literature pertaining to social anxiety are indeed talking about the same construct (Tillfors & Furmark, 2007). A study at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria (Bella & Omigbodun, 2009) examined the prevalence of social phobia among university students, as well as sociodemographic correlates and comorbidity with depression and alcohol use disorders. This study was a cross-sectional survey of students at the university and included undergraduate students who were 18 or older, had been at the university for at least one year, and who were currently living in the residence halls. Exclusion criteria included students with severe mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, or physical impairments, such as motor or sensory. They used multistage sampling to recruit 20   students to the study based on proportion to the population. They chose a sample size of 500 subjects based on the 0.3% lifetime prevalence of social phobia in the general population of Nigeria. The authors utilized a stratified selection for men and women separately due to unequal sex distribution in the student population. There were 413 participants. Of the 500 selected, 53 refused to participate, and 34 questionnaires were not used due to missing data. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 49 years old, with a mean age of 22.9 years and only 2.4% aged 30 or older. The majority of the participants were men (66.5%) and single (98.8%; Bella & Omigbodun, 2009). The study was completed in two stages. In the first stage, selected students were given a sociodemographic questionnaire, an alcohol use assessment, a general health questionnaire, and a disability assessment. In face-to-face interviews, the screening section of a diagnostic interview was administered. The sociodemographic questionnaire gathered information on age, gender, marital status, religion, state of origin, level and course of study, and monthly allowance. Additionally, it included their parents’ highest level of education and present occupation to determine the social class of the students. A diagnostic interview was completed using the World Mental Health Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI; Kessler & Ustun, 2004), which screens for several disorders, including social phobia and depression. The authors used the social phobia and depression module questions for the interview, basing diagnoses on DSM-IV criteria. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Adewuya, 2005; Saunders et al., 1993) is a self-rated, 10-item questionnaire about alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems. Each item is scored from zero to four, with total scores of five and above having been shown to be indicative of hazardous alcohol use. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12; Goldberg, 1978) is a self-administered assessment 21   designed to detect psychological distress. Scores above one suggest psychological distress; however, this study used a cutoff of two and above for specificity. The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS II; World Health Organization, 2000) is a 12-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses overall daily functioning. Items are rated on an ordinal scale from one (no difficulty) to five (extreme/cannot do). This study used the questions to assess for overall health and interference with daily living. The second stage of the study involved a follow-up to students who had provided a positive response to one or more screening questions for social phobia or depression. In the second stage, these students were administered the full diagnostic interview using the WMH-CIDI social phobia or depression module questions, with diagnoses based on the DSM-IV criteria (Bella & Omigbodun, 2009). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize continuous variables. Percentages were used to summarize categorical variables. The chi-squared test was used to compare two proportions and investigate the association between two qualitative variables at a 5% level of significance. Variables that were statistically significant in bivariate analysis were entered into a logistic regression analysis using a stepwise backward elimination method. Associations between social phobia and explanatory variables were computed using the logistic regression model (Bella & Omigbodun, 2009). Researchers found the 12-month social phobia prevalence was 8.5%, and the lifetime prevalence was 9.4% among university students sampled. They noted that social phobia was also strongly associated with depression, psychological distress, and poor overall health (Bella & Omigbodun, 2009). Only students who responded positively to one or more of the social phobia or depression screening questions were given a full interview, which means that there could be a possibility 22   that the lifetime prevalence could be underrepresented. Additional limitations to this study included that it was conducted in another country and could represent factors specific to the students in this study. However, it is helpful that they found similar prevalence rates to those found in other research. Overall, while the methods used would appear to support the validity of the research, one concern would be that the interviews with students were conducted at the residence hall, which could pose concerns for confidentiality and comfort (Bella & Omigbodun, 2009). A study in the United Kingdom (Russell & Shaw, 2009) used an opportunistic sampling method to investigate the prevalence of social anxiety among university undergraduate students at a large university and its partnership colleges across seven departments. The authors utilized an opportunistic sampling method to obtain participation from students from a variety of programs, as they noted a 2003 report indicated that vulnerability to mental health issues tends to vary by program. The sample consisted of 1,007 students from 7 faculties and 2 partner colleges. Postgraduate students were not included due to time constraints. Eight hundred fifty-six students, or 85.0% of the total population, completed the study questionnaire. Participants were of a broad age range, from under 21 to over 50, with the majority of students being under 30 years old. The sample was 61.3% women, 38.3% men, and 8 students who did not specify gender. Researchers assessed social anxiety using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS; Liebowitz, 1987), a self-report measure consisting of 24 items that describe a situation that an individual rates based upon how much anxiety that situation provokes for them (fear) and how often they avoid that situation (avoidance). Ratings are from zero (none or never) to three (severe or usually). The scale can be divided into four subscales of fear of performance, fear of social interaction, avoidance of performance, and avoidance of social interaction. It also provides a 23   total avoidance score and a total fear score, combined for a total LSAS score that measures the individual’s experience of clinical social anxiety. Scores below 55 are considered mild and clinically insignificant, while scores from 55 to 65 are moderate, 65 to 80 are marked, 80 to 95 are severe, and greater than 95 are very severe (Russell & Shaw, 2009). The researchers found that 9.9% of university and college students surveyed with the LSAS reported “marked” to “very severe” social anxiety (Russell & Shaw, 2009). It is unclear why they reported 9.9% versus the 16.4% of moderate to very severe scores, as scores above 55 are considered clinically significant. They also found a statistically significant difference between men and women, with women showing higher scores across total social anxiety and all subscales. Additional important findings included that a small proportion of the students reported a severe fear of speaking out in public, some reported a severe fear of interacting with strangers or people they did not know well, some reported they regularly avoided speaking out, and some reported they regularly avoided looking directly at people they were unfamiliar with (Russell & Shaw, 2009). These are important findings because each fear and behavior can significantly impact a student’s ability to engage effectively in their school and social settings. This study could generalizable to the broader population of college students, though the results have the potential to be related to the characteristics of the students who volunteered to participate in the study. The generalizability for this study is limited, as it only includes students from a UK university, and the demographic variables are minimal, so there is not a good understanding of the population sample that is included in this study and to whom these results can really apply. Additionally, the authors noted that the opportunistic sampling method used in this study resulted in disproportionate numbers of students particularly related to age and faculty (area of study), so it 24   is likely that the sample is not representative of the university population at this specific school or universities more broadly. Despite the concerns around generalizability, the prevalence rate they found was comparable to other studies examining the college population, which may suggest that this population has similar experiences across regions/countries/nationalities (Russell & Shaw, 2009). A study (Ahmad et al., 2017) was conducted at Garmian University to investigate the prevalence of social anxiety and associated factors among undergraduate students. The authors conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study, which entailed administering a demographic questionnaire and a social phobia inventory (SPIN) and then analyzing the data with descriptive and analytic statistics. With a total undergraduate college of education population of 1,918 students, the authors randomly selected 250 students and distributed questionnaires to them. Of these, 198 were fully completed, with a response rate of 79.2%. The participants ranged in age from 19 to 27, with a mean age of 20.53. Respondents were 107 female students (54%) and 91 male students. The sample consisted mostly of first-year students (35.9%), with 18.2% second-year students, 20.2% third-year students, and 25.8% fourth-year students (Ahmad et al., 2017). To assess social anxiety, researchers utilized a translated version of the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) developed by Connor et al. (2000), which consists of 17 items rated on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The inventory consists of three subscales: fear, avoidance, and physiological conditions. A score over 20 indicates social anxiety, with scores from 21 to 30 categorized as mild, 31 to 40 as moderate, 41 to 50 severe, and 51+ as very severe (Ahmad et al., 2017). The researchers found that more than 80% of students in the study showed varying degrees of social phobia based on responses to the SPIN, with 20.2% mild, 41.9% moderate, and 25   28.3% severe. They reported that only 8.6% of students endorsed below-threshold scores, and no students indicated very severe scores. They found an association between gender and social phobia, with a higher prevalence among women and higher prevalence among first- and second-year students who experienced a higher degree of social phobia than junior and senior students (Ahmad et al., 2017). While their findings had much higher prevalence rates than other similar studies (Bani Mustafa et al., 2014; Momeni et al., 2015; Salina et al., 2008; Tillfors & Furmark, 2007), their results were similar in indicating support for the prevalence of SAD among college students. This study also noted a higher prevalence of SAD among female students compared to men and first- and second-year students compared to third- and fourth-year students. This study has limited generalizability, as the sample was from one university, one college within that university, and with limited demographic data provided. It is unclear if the sample is representative of the population of the university, the country, or university students overall. Additionally, education students could have unique characteristics that lead to a prevalence different from the general college student population. As the study was survey-based, results could also be limited by the characteristics that led these students to respond versus those who did not. The authors proposed that social anxiety could also be why many students did not participate in the survey, which would also impact the prevalence. The authors mentioned that they controlled for limitations of mental and emotional conditions that could impact how students responded but did not elaborate on how or what exactly that means. As with many of the studies reviewed, it may be difficult to generalize these results to university students in the United States or other countries, but the findings indicating that SAD is a concern among university students are consistent with the current body of research overall. The authors 26   discussed that this estimated prevalence may not be the most accurate due to higher levels of anxiety found in girls and first-year and second-year students (similar to other studies), which made up more than half of their participants. It seems that the authors identified gender (specifically woman identified) as a predisposing factor for developing SAD, as they mentioned previous research that also indicated this. However, while a significant gender difference is noted, it is difficult to conclude anything more than a correlation for gender as a risk factor based on the study design. Social anxiety was assessed using the SPIN, which does not directly equate to a SAD diagnosis, but it has been demonstrated to differentiate between socially phobic and non-phobic populations (Connor et al., 2000). One concern about the methodology of the study is that the SPIN was not originally translated into Kurdish, so a team of experts at the university translated it into Kurdish for the study, which initially raises concern about the validity and reliability of the instrument as it has not been tested and researched in this form. To ensure validity, the researchers presented the translated version of the questionnaire to five psychology experts at the university who approved it, and then tested the validity and reliability of the instrument with a sample group of 50 students prior to using the instrument in the study. Another challenge in this study, much like in others, is the interchangeable use of social anxiety and social phobia, which can be confusing as diagnostically these terms refer to a somewhat different set of criteria. Specifically, they refer to the SPIN as the social anxiety inventory while also referencing social phobia disorder and socially phobic individuals. It is unclear if this is an intentional change, perhaps in an effort to use more current terminology, or a translational issue, but being the name of an official measure, it seems problematic to refer to it by an alternative name (Ahmad et al., 2017). 27   A study from Gondar, Ethiopia, examined the prevalence of social phobia and its correlates among undergraduate university students studying health science (Desalegn et al., 2019). The study intended to inform the development of interventions for students that would ensure they receive optimal care. The study was an institution-based cross-sectional study conducted with students from the College of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Gondar. The only exclusion was students who were critically ill, though the authors did not define that term. The authors determined sample size using a single population proportion formula, which included a margin of error, estimated prevalence of social phobia from a previous study completed in Ethiopia, and an anticipated non-response rate. They recruited students through a simple random sampling technique using a lottery method. The final sample consisted of 503 participants, with a 100% response rate. The participants had a mean age of 22.17 years old, with 43.3% between ages 18 and 21. Participants were 72% men, 93.8% single, 57.5% from rural residences, and 36.8% third-year students. Of the participants in the sample, 2.6% reported a history of mental illness, 16.7% reported a chronic physical illness, and 3.2% reported a family history of mental illness. Regarding social support, 41.4% of participants reported poor social support, 43.3.% reported moderate social support, and 15.3% reported strong social support. In relation to substance use, 43.7% of participants reported drinking alcohol and 11.1% reported taking a stimulant called khat (Desalegn et al., 2019). Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire which assessed sociodemographic factors, social support, clinical factors, and substance use. The authors assessed the level of social support using the Oslo 3-item Social Support Scale (OSSS-3; Dalgard & Brevik, 1996), which consists of three items that measure social functioning, including the number of people the participant feels close to, the amount of interest and concern others show 28   the participant, and the ease in which the participant can obtain practical help from others. Total scores range from 3 to 14 and are categorized as poor support (3 to 8), moderate support (9 to 11), and strong support (12 to 14). The SPIN, which was previously discussed, was used to assess social phobia/social anxiety in this study (Desalegn et al., 2019). The authors used a univariate analysis to test associations between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Then, independent variables with P-values less than 0.2 were entered into the multivariate logistic regression model to identify the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable (Desalegn et al., 2019). The researchers found a prevalence of social phobia symptoms of 31.2% based on responses to the SPIN, with 16.7% mild, 9.3% moderate, 3.8% severe, and 1.39% very severe. Factors that were significantly associated with social phobia were being female, a first-year student, from rural areas, and having poor support. They found that women were 2.3 times more likely to have social phobia than their peers. First-year students were 5.5 times more likely to have social phobia than students in other years. Students who lived in rural areas were 1.6 times more likely to develop social phobia than students from urban areas. Compared to students with good social support, students with poor social support were 2.8 times more likely to have social phobia (Desalegn et al., 2019). Some limitations of this study are that it was cross-sectional and, therefore, could not determine conclusions about causality regarding social anxiety and the related factors they explored. Due to the study design, one cannot conclude that these correlated factors can explain the cause of social phobia, but they are significantly associated with it and may be important risk factors to consider for social phobia. Additionally, with most cross-sectional studies, there were concerns about the differences between participants who responded and those who did not, but in 29   this study, there was a 100% response rate which would ideally mean that the sample was representative of the population and there would be limited response bias. The authors indicated that the sample consisted of a small number of students, which could impact generalizability, especially as the sample was from one college at the university and primarily men. Therefore, the results may not be as generalizable to the broader university population, young adult population of Ethiopia, or college and university overall. Despite generalizability concerns, the researchers did find a similar prevalence rate to other studies with college students in different countries. The authors indicated that their result was consistent with the estimated prevalence found in studies in other countries. The SPIN has not been validated in Ethiopia but has been widely used and validated in other countries with adolescents and adults. There could be a question of whether the SPIN was measuring the intended construct for this population, though its use in many countries may indicate that it is a reliable measure across cultures. It is unclear how the authors chose the cutoff scores for their population without previous validation studies. While there are general cutoff scores per the SPIN manual and instructions, at times, the best cutoff score to determine potential social anxiety varies by population and could be important to assess (per SPIN manual; Connor et al., 2000; Davidson, 2021). Like other assessments, the SPIN does not directly equate to a diagnosis of social phobia or SAD, so discretion should be used in interpreting findings. Relating to concerns about the constructs being measured, it should be considered whether using social phobia criteria and SPIN is measuring SAD in terms of current criteria established in the DSM-IV, as these could be reflecting information on different constructs related to social anxiety. A small note is that the authors did not cite the measures or abbreviate them correctly, which may be stylistic or possibly related to translation if that occurred especially being from another 30   country, but this may be an issue when it comes to standardization of research. For example, if someone is looking for studies using the SPIN, this study may be missed as it referenced the SPI. One study examined the prevalence and severity of social anxiety among medical students in Ukraine (Pshyk et al., 2019). They investigated the prevalence of social anxiety among university students with the purpose of developing and implementing a group format program to treat social anxiety. The sample consisted of 120 medical students in years 3 through 6 of medical school at National Pirogov Memorial Medical University. The participants had an average age of 20.4 years old, with 70 men and 50 women (Pshyk et al., 2019). The authors utilized the SPIN and the LSAS, which were previously discussed, and the  Social Performance Rating Scale (SPRS; Wells, 1997). As described by Nordahl and Wells (2018), the SPRS (social phobia) consists of five rating scales that assess distress, avoidance, self-consciousness, safety behavior use, and negative beliefs. Each scale appears to have a differing number of items and rating scale; it is unclear if there are standard ranges for rating the items, as their description demonstrated a wide variation in range based on the scale. As this study did not report any data or how they used this scale, it did not seem relevant to explore this measure further since how it was used or any results from it could not be determined (Pshyk et al., 2019). The authors relayed that they used the SPIN to screen the participants and reported a 31.7% prevalence of participants (38 students) in their sample with varying degrees of social anxiety. They indicated participants fell into the following categories of 12.5% (15 students) mild, 10% (12 students) moderate, and 9.2% (11 students) severe social anxiety, with seemingly no “very severe” endorsements (Pshyk et al., 2019). 31   The major focus of the study was describing and reviewing the group treatment they were testing. Students who screened with symptoms of social anxiety were given a consult that identified features of social anxiety such as isolation, comorbidities, and impact on quality of life. Then, students were offered placement in a group format to work on social anxiety. The treatment was a closed psychotherapeutic group with 17 members from the sample who were primarily diagnosed with moderate to severe social anxiety. The article is not explicit in how these 17 were chosen from the 38 participants who endorsed symptoms of social anxiety after the initial screening. It is reported that they used the SPIN and LSAS for more detail on each participant in the group; however, this is not elaborated on. After the treatment group was completed, the SPIN was administered again to participants in the group treatment to compare pre- and post-treatment social anxiety levels. The authors did not report statistical analyses of these results but indicated that there was a decrease in general social anxiety scores for all members of the group (Pshyk et al., 2019). It was very difficult to assess the quality of this research and the results of this study due to so little information being included in the final article to allow readers to follow along with the process and make conclusions. This primary factor may lead one to conclude that it was not the best quality, though it could be possible that this format was standard for the researchers’ region. The results of this study may have limited generalizability, particularly to the United States or other Western university students, as this study was completed in Ukraine. There was significantly limited demographic data on the study participants, so the generalizability to non-medical students, broader university students in Ukraine, and college students worldwide was difficult to ascertain. There was also no discussion on how the participants were recruited to gain further information about internal and external validity. Therefore, results should be considered 32   with caution. While the prevalence found was within the range found in other studies, it is unknown how representative this sample was of the population of the medical school, the broader university, or the local population, which creates a challenge in understanding the meaning of that percentage (Pshyk et al., 2019). As the study mentioned two other measures to assess social anxiety in addition to the SPIN, it would have been helpful to know how those measures were used and how all the measures compared when examining the results of their participants. The authors indicated that these measures were used to estimate levels of social anxiety, but they did not describe the measures or how they used them in this study, so it is unclear what role they all played. Without a detailed description of the methods used in this study, it is challenging to evaluate some strengths or limitations regarding the prevalence findings and the testing of a treatment intervention. Additionally, results from each of these measures were not clearly reported, though they indicated using a four-point evaluation system to estimate fears and anxiety of participants in, as well as avoidance of, specific social situations and then statistical processing was completed using Microsoft Excel (Pshyk et al., 2019). It seems that the primary focus of the study was the group intervention, but even then, they reported very little about what they did, how they did it, or explicit outcome data. They did not describe any specific statistics that were conducted or demonstrate how they would determine the effectiveness of the program. While they reported SPIN scores from before and after the intervention, they were only shown in graphical form, which visibly showed a change in scores from time one to time two, but it was not clear if these changes were statistically significant. Statistics could have been conducted to demonstrate whether these changes were clinically significant. Without this information, it is unclear if these changes would matter 33   clinically, nor is there a comparison/control group to determine if the changes were any more than anyone might have over a 10-week period. Indicating that this program has shown its effectiveness and can be used in other work or in other universities seems like an overassessment. Regarding the practice of group therapy, the type of group and setting of the group plays a role in how the group is set up. The optimum number of participants for group therapy is 8 to 12 members (Ezhumalai et al., 2018). A group with 17 participants is large, which may impact the group intervention effectiveness. Additionally, the authors discussed training assertiveness skills and developing confident behavior without indicating how those two concepts might be connected. Overall, the steps taken and the direction chosen in the study and intervention were not clearly connected to let the reader understand the theoretical underpinnings of the research, which made it challenging to understand and validate. The authors did choose to elaborate more on some areas than others, such as describing components of theory and steps in the intervention with participants directly, which it appears could allow for some replication of their work but not enough to fully replicate it (Pshyk et al., 2019). Another study examined the prevalence of social anxiety in undergraduate university students at Hawassa University in Ethiopia (Reta et al., 2020). This cross-sectional study was conducted with undergraduate students in the College of Medicine and Health Sciences during April and May 2018. The authors determined the sample size for their study with a single population proportion formula. The authors recruited 304 students, of which 293 completed the questionnaire and were used in the study, a 93.6% response rate. Participants were selected using stratified random sampling, where each department was the stratum and data were independently collected from each department. Samples were proportioned based on the total number of 34   students in each department. For this study, data were collected by trained data collectors and facilitated by supervisors. The authors utilized a nine-item questionnaire to assess student characteristics related to socio-demographics, academics, and clinical information. The final sample of 293 participants had a mean age of 22.13 years, was 58.7% male, 95.6% single, 48.1% Amhara by ethnicity, 63.1% Ethiopian orthodox, 72% below the fourth year of study, and 56.7% medical students. In the total sample, 8.5% of participants reported a previous history of mental illness, and 7.5% reported a family history of mental illness (Reta et al., 2020). To assess social phobia, the researchers used the SPIN, which has been discussed. The authors reported that the SPIN had been previously validated in Nigeria, with 82.2% sensitivity and 77.6% specificity. The researchers assessed social support using the Oslo Social Support Scale (OSSS-3), which was discussed previously. The authors reported that previous research found acceptable validity and reliability of the OSSS-3 with the African population, indicating that it was appropriate for use with their population (Reta et al., 2020). In this study, the authors performed a binary logistic regression to examine any association between each independent variable and the dependent variable. Any variables that had statistical significance when the p-value was less than or equal to 0.25 were further examined in multiple logistic regressions to identify any independent effects. They performed multiple logistic regression analysis to determine if any factors were associated with social anxiety (Reta et al., 2020). The results indicated a 32.8% prevalence rate for SAD among the participants. They also reported social support among participants categorized as 24.2% excellent, 31.4% very good, 29.4% good, and 15% poor social support. They found factors that were significantly associated with SAD to be a family history of mental illness and being a third- or fourth-year student. Those 35   with a family history of mental illness were 4.7 times more likely to develop SAD than those without a family history. Being a third- or fourth-year student significantly predicted social phobia (Reta et al., 2020). The authors shared some cultural background information that in Ethiopia shyness is emphasized as a dominant cultural norm due to being seen as a measure of politeness (Reta et al., 2020). While shyness is not equivalent to SAD, it would be interesting if the social-cultural norms of emphasizing shyness/politeness led to an increased prevalence or experience of what is considered anxiety in other cultures. It would seem important to then differentiate between a cultural concept and a diagnostic disorder. In this study, the researchers found that being a third- or fourth-year student significantly predicted social phobia but reported that compared to fifth-year students these students were less likely to develop SAD. This is confusing because they did not find a significant correlation between being a fifth-year student and social anxiety. Additionally, they acknowledged that this was the opposite of what three other studies have found, including one that was also in Ethiopia and found a similar prevalence rate to theirs. This might bring some question about the statistics that were performed and their interpretations. They collected demographic information, but they did not include much explanation around many of the demographics they collected or the results of them. The demographic data may have been collected to examine the representativeness of their sample and not as specific study points or for comparison. They examined “previous resident area” and it could be important to compare urban and rural students, as this could be a significant factor to consider particularly for undergraduate students who are adjusting to university (Reta et al., 2020). 36   Some limitations of this study include the cross-sectional design, which does not allow causation to be inferred from the correlations found. It seems that the authors attempted to acknowledge this limitation; however, they may have unintentionally written that the design type “does not allow the correlation to be inferred” (Reta et al., 2020, p. 575) when they indeed did find correlations. While noting this, some of the phrasing that they used implies causation in stating that the factors with significant associations played a role in the “development” of SAD when causation cannot possibly be known due to the study design. This is problematic when considering that some of their findings were not wholly similar to previous findings, aside from the prevalence rate. Additionally, they noted that the SPIN was not validated in Ethiopia, which could lead to some error, though they reported validation in other African countries. The assumption of validity in other African countries applying to the country of the current study could make sense as it has been demonstrated to work with people from cultures that are more similar to theirs than if that validity had not already been demonstrated. The authors shared that as a nondiagnostic self-rating screening tool, the SPIN might overestimate the prevalence of SAD, though they noted it has high validity and reliability in many countries (Reta et al., 2020). Some research that was explored was completed on specific phobias, which was appropriate to include as it is anxiety related and social anxiety adjacent. Some of the experiences that may be captured in specific phobias are directly related to experiences of SAD. Seim and Spates (2010) completed a study examining specific phobias in college students. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of phobias and fears among college students, determine which phobias and fears are more likely to co-occur, and establish how many of these students would be interested in treatment. They completed an epidemiological study that surveyed 813 college students from a large Midwest university. They reported that less than 1% 37   of students refused to participate fully in the study. The sample of students were between 18 and 47 years old, with a mean age of 19. The sample consisted of 58% female, 42% male, 87% non-Hispanic Caucasian, 6% African American, 3% Asian or Pacific Islander, 3% Latino, and 0.1% Native American (Seim & Spates, 2010). Classes were surveyed during the first 10 minutes, where the survey was introduced, informed consent was provided, and then a questionnaire was administered. The questionnaire consisted of 12 different fears found to be common in community samples. Participants rated how much they experienced each fear on a five-point Likert scale from zero (no fear) to four (severe fear), and then they responded to a question asking if they were interested in receiving treatment for these fears, and, if so, how many sessions they would attend in treatment. They were also asked if they would only attend treatment for extra class credit, which was used as a validity measure for students who were not interested in personal benefits. There was also space at the end of the questionnaire for students to write about other fears or phobias they experienced and would be interested in treatment for (Seim & Spates, 2010). This study found that 31% of the participants feared public speaking, with 11% reporting a severe fear, and 5% of the participants feared meeting new people, with 1% reporting a severe fear, both of which can be aspects of social anxiety. Particularly interesting is the comorbidities found in which 12% of participants who reported significant or severe fear of public speaking reported a fear of meeting new people, and 70% of participants who reported a significant or severe fear of meeting new people reported a fear of public speaking. Of those who reported significant and severe fear of public speaking and meeting new people, 20% and 28%, respectively, indicated an interest in receiving treatment (Seim & Spates, 2010). 38   While this study was not directly investigating social anxiety, the results showed that many students were impacted by fears that could impair their college experience. Some of these fears overlapped with the experience of social anxiety, which highlights the importance of looking more closely at social anxiety and the impact it can have on the college experience. Some limitations of this study include that a small number of fears and phobias were assessed, which left out many common fears such as thunderstorms, flying, and crossing bridges. However, this was intentional, as they were only examining fears that would be most likely to interfere with a student’s college experience and fears that could be easily treated in the university setting. The authors did acknowledge that a formal assessment of a wider range of fears relevant to this population would be useful, such as sexual assault and failing school. The inclusion of more common fears and social fears may have been helpful in capturing a broader picture of the student experience, particularly around things that are present in their daily lives and could impact or impair daily functioning, including academic success. For example, some of the write-ins are very common phobias one could expect to be assessed, like clowns. Additionally, this study did not fully assess the criteria for formal diagnosis, so the use of self-identified fear and severity only approximated the prevalence of fears or phobias on campus. While they did assess the prevalence of these fears, they were not clinically assessed, and the degree to which these were clinical fears in that they interfere with the functioning of these students is unknown as it was self-reported. The generalizability of this study may be limited, as there may have been bias in the sample. It was not stated if or how the sample was chosen and whether the researchers utilized random selection, such as which classes were assessed and how they chose those classes, nor how representative the sample was of the population at the university or geographic area. While there were limited demographics of the sample, participants 39   were primarily White, which may be representative of a Midwest university, but this may miss or misrepresent fears or phobias that different groups of students may experience. It seems that more research with broader, more representative samples across different universities and geographic areas would be needed to conclude that specific fears are “quite prevalent on college campuses” (Seim & Spates, 2010, p. 54), though this is likely a good place to start in exploring that research. In examining the previously explored studies on social anxiety and social phobia among college students, one can see that social anxiety and the impact it has on students’ success in college is of concern and becoming notably important. With that said, there is significant variety in the results being found and the quality of the research being completed. For example, just in reviewing these studies, it can be inferred that the prevalence of social anxiety among college students is between 8.5% (Bella & Omigbodun, 2009) and 80% (Ahmad et al., 2017). This is a dramatically wide range of possibility, even accounting for differences between geographic locations, schools, countries, majors, and assessment measures used. This range indicates that there are likely significant inconsistencies in the study of social anxiety, despite the significant impact it is believed to have on individuals. The prevalence rates found in research thus far include 8.5% for 12 months and 9.4% lifetime (Bella & Omigbodun, 2009), 9.9% “marked” to “very severe” and 16.4% if moderate scores are included (Russell & Shaw, 2009), 16.1% (Tillfors & Furmark, 2007), 22% (Strahan, 2003), 19% and 33% (as cited by Strahan, 2003) in additional research, 31.2% (Desalegn et al., 2019), 31.7% (Pshyk et al., 2019), 32.8% (Reta et al., 2020), 48.1% (Kuder & Grover, 2014), and 80% (Ahmad et al., 2017). There are many reasons why the prevalence rates may vary, though the majority of studies falling between 16.4% and 32.8% may point us toward a narrower range of prevalence for university students. 40   Overall, the research appears to be of moderate quality, and though there are some common concerns among most studies, there are only three studies that are of questionable quality and should be considered with caution, Desalegn et al. (2019), Pshyk et al. (2019), and Reta et al. (2020). Overall, the main challenge across these studies is generalizability to a larger population, which is a general concern across all research as the sample population available will always have limits and varying methods for completing the research studies. Regarding generalizability, some studies seemed to take care and consideration for selecting their populations, while in others, it seems they did their best to randomly select participants and many used convenience sampling, as is common in university research. Some studies are rather small, particularly those examining prevalence, or are very limited in population representation, for example, when they only include certain majors, making generalizability to a larger university population very difficult. Randomization of sampling should be more commonplace, especially for the broader university population, though maybe it is not always realistic. This is especially a concern when examining smaller subsets of the population, such as minority students and those with intersectional and marginalized identities, as their experiences may differ in significant ways. In some studies, opportunistic samples lead to disproportionate numbers of certain sub-populations/demographics and ultimately unrepresentative samples. Many of the samples were homogenous, which often may have been representative of the population at the university, especially in international studies, but which can certainly create a challenge when attempting to compare populations across research since there may be cultural factors at play that create a difference. For example, as was mentioned in one study, in Ethiopia, shyness is emphasized as a dominant cultural norm due to being seen as a measure of politeness (Reta et al., 2020). While one cannot equate shyness with SAD fully, it would be useful to determine whether 41   social norms increased that anxious experience for people or contributed to differences found across populations. Additionally, there is always a chance for response bias and the students who did participate in the research having certain unique qualities and characteristics, which could be assuaged with more broad and inclusive random sampling. This relates again to studies examining specific populations and convenience samples, which are at least a good place to start but something future research may benefit from controlling for more. Underestimates of prevalence are possible when the impairment or experience of non-respondents who declined to participate in studies is unknown, which some authors posited could be a result of social anxiety itself, among other factors. At times, the demographics collected are limited, which limits the factors that can be compared or examined but also makes it difficult to know the population being discussed and how the sample compares to the broader population. For example, across these studies, there is some variation in mean age and year that the students were in, which could impact the results, especially as some studies have indicated that the prevalence of social anxiety varied by year and, in some cases, there were opposing results on what those trends look like. Overall, it would seem helpful that once general research is established, subsequent research could look more specifically at the breakdowns and differences in prevalence and the impact of social anxiety on different years in school.  In some instances, the primary purpose of the study was not to determine prevalence, and as there are studies dedicated to doing that, it may be important to assess whether these studies are sufficiently assessing prevalence and if the results from these studies are an accurate view of the prevalence. Additionally, at times some studies used a dataset that was part of a larger study, and it was unclear if their studies were a part of the original plans for research or if 42   they were able to ask these questions after the fact simply due to the data collected, which could pose some concerns around the population and sample used if it limited the data that were used or there were inherently some different characteristics of that sample due to the larger sample they were taken from. There was also variation in the type of study conducted and the limits of different types of studies regarding utility. For example, many studies utilized cross-sectional approaches where correlations could be found, but they were unable to speak to the causality of related factors. This may not be as pertinent for prevalence rates, but prevalence was often not the main focus of many studies. Some studies attempted to posit that correlated factors might be able to explain social anxiety, but the research is not sufficient to support that. Differing methods may also relate to the variation among response rates reported in different studies. There is some concern for two-part studies, where only students who screened for social anxiety were included in the second portion. This may limit some of the data collected, especially when timelines vary. For example, if some studies assess for symptoms or information in the last year and others in the last five years or last six months, the rates may vary significantly, especially if researchers are only asking those who screened positive in that set time range for historical or lifetime occurrence, as others with lifetime occurrence may have already been excluded. Across these various studies, there was variation in the methods used to collect data, including surveys sent to homes, interviews conducted in dorms, surveys completed in classrooms, and assessments and observations in labs. This variation could impact the results found, especially those completed in spaces that may not be the most confidential. What may be even more challenging than the variation of methods used is that, at times, there is little description or elaboration on the methods. In some studies, it is unclear how some key aspects of the research were completed, such as how the sample was recruited, the specific 43   steps taken in the study, how data were analyzed, or whether all the data that were collected or analyzed were not reported in the article. This could lead to significant challenges in replicating studies in the future, but also in being able to interpret and determine how viable and clinically useful the findings are. This becomes even more of a concern when there is sometimes uncertainty about the statistics or analyses performed and the interpretations made from them, especially if it seemed there was a misunderstanding in the article itself. Having all the methods and data available would allow consumers to see what the authors were seeing and how they came to their conclusions. Furthermore, when there are opposing findings, which do not seem abnormal, it can allow for a better understanding of where those differences arise and what they mean. Often self-reporting surveys were used, which is very common in research, and many of the measures have established reliability and validity. However, one concern that this may raise, particularly with a socially anxious population, is whether results may be affected by social desirability and whether this could have led to underreporting of symptoms, minimization of problems, or increased competence levels. An additional challenge with self-report measures is that they may limit the accuracy of the diagnostic tools or data collected, as participants may demonstrate bias by inaccurately assessing themselves, misunderstanding or misinterpreting the questions, or having a tendency for neutral or extreme response ratings. Another concern is that translations or altering of measures within the study could impact the measure’s validity and reliability, especially in studies where the researchers do not indicate the steps they took, if any, to test the instruments or alterations before using them in their study. Additionally, at times some measures were not yet validated in the country where the study took place, which could pose some concerns for the accuracy of the assessment, even if the population 44   and culture may be similar to others who have used the measure. A benefit of this is that it seems some measures are demonstrating reliability across cultures, which could be very useful in future research as it could address some concerns around the construct being studied and the validity of results from different studies. The most notable and significant concern observed across these studies is how social anxiety or social phobia was measured. Few of the studies base the assessment of social anxiety or social phobia on diagnostic criteria, so there could be some question about whether they were assessing clinical social anxiety or sub-clinical experiences of social anxiety. Another question to consider is whether each of these studies, and the body of research at large, is examining, talking about, or researching the same construct of social anxiety. This is particularly significant because, across studies, there is variation in what instruments are used to assess social anxiety. There is the possibility that some of these instruments may be measuring different constructs or different aspects of the construct that may not equate to the same thing. This could be a contributing factor to the vast range of prevalence rates observed. In turn, this leaves the question: How can the prevalence rates of each of the studies be compared if they use different methods to assess SAD and, therefore, could be assessing different constructs? An additional challenge related to the variation in instruments is the varying use of language. All the studies reviewed are from 2003 or later, which is nine years after the release of the DSM-IV and the change from social phobia to SAD; however, over half of the studies referred to social phobia, interchanged social anxiety and social phobia, or used measures that assess social phobia. It is unclear why they used the term social phobia instead of SAD. Recurrent use of social phobia terminology versus social anxiety raises the concern of whether they were examining the same thing and whether these measures are still representative of what 45   they are trying to assess, especially if the measures were made to assess or are using social phobia criteria, which was a narrower definition and more limited criteria than SAD in DSM-IV and, subsequently, DSM-5. This gives cause for concern or at least consideration in ensuring that the constructs being measured, instruments used for measurement, and the overall literature pertaining to social anxiety are indeed talking about the same concept. SAD in the LGB Population Continuing the investigation into the prevalence of social anxiety among LGB college students, the prevalence of social anxiety among the LGB population in general has also been examined. Research into the prevalence of SAD among the LGB population has improved over time, with an increased interest in examining LGB mental health overall in the last two decades, as it became apparent that this population may be at an increased risk for mental health disorders compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Some factors may contribute to this increased risk for the development of mental health concerns, including minority stress, social stress, prejudice and discrimination, and difficulties with identity and development. These factors and their potential impact on the individual highlight the importance of understanding the role of social anxiety and its impact on LGB individuals’ development and social functioning. Understanding that LGB adolescents and adults have an increased risk for psychosocial concerns in general (Kirsch et al., 2015), it is important to understand the role that SAD also plays in the experiences of LGB individuals, especially considering how important community and social support is for LGB individuals who may face challenges when it comes to acceptance from their peers and family. For example, nonheterosexual individuals reported fewer social supports, less satisfaction with social supports, and fewer positive events than their heterosexual peers (Safren & Pantalone, 2006), and it has been found that they may have more negative 46   thoughts surrounding social situations than their heterosexual peers (as cited in Wadsworth & Hayes-Skelton, 2015). Several studies have suggested that social anxiety is higher among the LGBTQ population (both youth and adults) than among their heterosexual peers (Bostwick et al., 2010; Pachankis & Goldfried, 2006; Safren & Pantalone, 2006; Sandfort et al., 2001). Sandfort et al. (2001) completed a study examining the differences in the prevalence of mental health disorders between heterosexual and sexual minority individuals. They compared the prevalence of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders among heterosexual and sexual minority individuals in the Netherlands to assess the relationship between sexual orientation and mental health. Their data came from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS; Bijl et al., 1998), which used a representative sample of the Dutch population aged 18 to 64 to assess for psychiatric disorders. The survey used a multistage, stratified, random sampling procedure to recruit households in the Netherlands in which one respondent per household was randomly selected for participation in the study. In total, 7,076 people were interviewed, with a 69.7% response rate of the eligible respondents. Face-to-face interviews using the CIDI (Andrews & Peters, 1998) were used to determine DSM-III-R diagnoses by trained, non-clinician interviewers. The authors reported that the CIDI has acceptable reliability and validity for nearly all diagnoses except acute psychosis. The diagnoses of participants were determined through data processing. Respondents were assessed for psychiatric disorders prior to assessment of their sexual behavior to minimize chances of contamination. Sexual behavior was verbally assessed by asking respondents if they had sexual contact in the preceding year. They were also asked the gender of their partners and respondents were categorized as “homosexual” if they had sex with someone of the same gender, whether it was exclusively same sex or not. The interviewers did not assess sexual orientation (Sandfort et al., 2001). 47   Of the total sample, 30 respondents did not report their sexual behavior, 1,043 participants were not sexually active, and 5 additional respondents lacked the data to categorize them as heterosexual or “homosexual.” This left 5,998 respondents for the current study, 84.8% of the initial sample that could be classified. Participants classified as “homosexual” included 2.8% (82) men and 1.4% (43) women who had sex with same-sex partners. Six of these men and six of these women categorized as “homosexual” also had sex with opposite-sex individuals (Sandfort et al., 2001). The researchers found a higher 12-month and lifetime prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders among sexual minority men compared to heterosexual men and a higher 12-month and lifetime prevalence of substance use disorders among sexual minority women compared to heterosexual women. They also found a higher lifetime prevalence of general mood disorders and major depression among sexual minority women compared to heterosexual women. The 12-month prevalence of social phobia was 3% for heterosexual men, 7.3% for sexual minority men, 5.8% for heterosexual women, and 7.0% for sexual minority women. The lifetime prevalence of social phobia was 5.5% for heterosexual men, 14.6% for sexual minority men, 9.5% for heterosexual women, and 18.6% for sexual minority women (Sandfort et al., 2001). Strengths of this study include that they used a large representative sample, that participants were selected without reference to sexual orientation, they did not use a convenience sample, the large number of participants allowed for separate analyses for men and women, and they utilized a reliable and standardized diagnostic instrument. However, some challenges related to these factors included that selecting participants without reference to sexual orientation may have led to a smaller number of sexual minority participants; they indicated that a limited number of sexual minority participants could have contributed to underestimated differences 48   between groups. Additionally, they seem to have conflated gender and sex at times, assessing the participants’ gender (man or woman), but defining sexuality in terms of sex (male or female), which also excludes other nonheterosexual or nonbinary identities (Sandfort et al., 2001). While the researchers utilized the CIDI, which has reportedly good validity and reliability, the diagnoses were based on DSM-III-R, published in 1987. The DSM-IV was published in 1994, and WHO published its psychiatric assessment instruments book in 1995, detailing that the CIDI version 2.0 assesses diagnoses using the ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria. The authors did not address using the older version, though perhaps the new version was not as accessible yet in 1996. They may have used this version of the diagnostic criteria because the assessment was well-validated. Using outdated diagnostic materials may lead to inaccurate assessment due to changes in norms and disorder criteria. Further limitations of this study include the generalizability of the results outside of the Netherlands or to minority populations within the Netherlands. The authors indicated that they may have found lower mental health rates than other Western countries potentially would find due to a more tolerant climate toward “homosexuality” in the Netherlands. They hypothesized that some differences could be because “homosexual men might have been less reluctant to admit specific complaints” (Sandfort et al., 2001, p. 89), though this seems in opposition to the idea that differences may have been underestimated due to the limited number of sexual minority participants. Despite the authors controlling for some demographic variables, there is the possibility that other confounding variables, which were not controlled for, contributed to the observed differences found. The original study used a cross-sectional design, which does not allow for assessment of cause of the observed differences. 49   A significant critique of this study is that they used sexual behavior to define sexuality, which does not necessarily equate to someone’s sexual orientation or identity. The researchers perceived the use of recent sexual behavior as a strength of their study and indicated that they believed it was a better indicator of “homosexual self-labeling” (Sandfort et al., 2001, p. 89) than lifetime sexual behavior despite the results of numerous studies (Bajos et al., 1998; Doll et al., 1992; Laumann et al., 1994) that they cited, which indicate that there are discrepancies between “homosexual behavior” and sexual orientation or labels. While the researchers cited many resources for statements made throughout the paper, they simply stated although there were discrepancies, they thought it was a better indicator without any research to support this. Additionally, they believed this in part contributed to being able to more precisely look examine relationship between same-sex attraction and mental health, but some could argue that they were not wholly examining sexual minority orientation, more so just a part of it. There has been research (Savin-Williams & Cohen, 2015) examining the importance of identity in relation to mental health and development, yet those who sleep with members of the same sex or gender do not all identify as a sexual minority. Therefore, they may have been including people in the sample who did not hold a sexual minority identity and did not have the same experiences as people who do. Additionally, it is not clear if the researchers asked about the circumstances in which the sexual behaviors occurred. It is possible that some people had same-sex sexual encounters with multiple partners, which may certainly not reflect on their identity. Furthermore, by excluding lifetime partners or sexual behaviors and only examining partners and behaviors within the last year, it is likely that the researchers may have excluded many people who could have added to each group or that they miscategorized people who did hold a sexual minority identity that was 50   not depicted by recent sexual behaviors. For example, bisexual individuals who have only engaged with opposite-sex partners over the last year would be incorrectly categorized as heterosexual despite past behavior, relationships, or self-labeled identity. There are many people with sexual minority identities who have not or will not ever engage in same-sex sex sexual activity. The researchers could also be excluding people who had not been able to explore their sexuality through sexual behavior, which could be limited by lack of partnership or even mental health. The authors noted the role of current distress and relationship status on overall mental health, as well as potential challenges facing sexual minority individuals regarding making intimate connections, which could be all the more reason to utilize self-identified orientation labels. This could lead to missing a significant portion of an already small population and adds to erasure of bisexuality as a sexual minority identity, especially as people who engaged in sexual behaviors with members of same and opposite-sex were categorized as “homosexual only.” An irony of that categorization is that the authors claimed in other studies people were grouped together based on lifetime experiences to make up for small numbers and it was a positive thing that they did not do that. However, they did decide to aggregate people, disregarding their life experiences and not asking about how they identified and effectively erasing any identity outside of homosexual or heterosexual. It also seems incongruent not to assess sexual behavior beyond a year when mental health was assessed for 12-month and lifetime prevalence (Sandfort et al., 2001). One study by Gilman et al. (2001) examined the risk of psychiatric disorders among individuals engaging in same-sex sexual behavior. This study used data from the National Comorbidity Study (NCS; Kessler et al., 1994), which collects survey information from a nationally representative household sample of people between the ages of 15 and 54 years old in 51   the United States. The NCS interviews took place in two parts from 1990 through 1992, with a response rate of 82.4%. In the first part of the study, participants were assessed for DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders using a modified version of the CIDI structured interview, which has been previously discussed. Participants moved on to part two of the study if they screened positively for a lifetime psychiatric disorder. In addition, a random sample of other respondents were also given the second part of the interview. In part two, the questions assessing sexual activity were also included. All participants were asked the number of women that they had sexual intercourse with in the preceding five years and in a separate question they were asked the number of men that they had sexual intercourse with in the preceding five years. Based on responses to these two questions, participants were identified as homosexually active, exclusively heterosexually active, or not sexually active. Those who were not sexually active were not included in the analyses. Of the remaining sample, 125 participants (1.8%) reported having any same-sex sexual partners, of which 74 were men and 51 were women. Within the same-sex subsample, 77 participants (41 men and 36 women) reported having both same-sex and opposite-sex partners, and 48 participants (33 men and 15 women) reported having exclusively same-sex partners. The exclusively opposite-sex sexual partners subsample consisted of 4,785 participants (2,310 men and 2,475 women) and the subsample of participants who reported no sexual partners included 967 participants (439 men and 528 women; Gilman et al., 2001). The authors utilized simple cross-tabulations to assess the differences in the 12-month prevalence of DSM-III-R disorders between the same-sex partnered and opposite-sex partnered subsamples. They used discrete time-survival analysis based on retrospective age-at-onset reports to estimate the relationships of lifetime risk and age of onset variables with those who had same-sex partners versus those who had opposite-sex partners. Then, the authors used 52   logistic regression to estimate the association between 12-month persistence of disorders for those who had same-sex partners versus those who has opposite-sex partners. In all of the analyses, the authors reported that they controlled for sociodemographic variables and made separate estimates for men and women (Gilman et al., 2001). The 12-month prevalence of social phobia was 8.8% for same-sex partnered men, 6.3% for opposite-sex partnered men, 10.4% for same-sex partnered women, and 9.1% for opposite-sex partnered women. The researchers did not find any statistically significant differences between the subsamples regarding age, education, income, or race/ethnicity. There were some differences in prevalence of psychiatric disorders between the subsamples, but most were not statistically significant. For example, same-sex partnered women had a higher prevalence of 11 of the 12 disorders assessed than opposite-sex partnered women, but only major depression, simple phobia, and PTSD were statistically different. The difference in social anxiety was not statistically significant. Additionally, while same-sex partnered men appeared more likely to have any anxiety, mood, or substance use disorder than opposite-sex partnered men, there was no higher prevalence of any specific psychiatric disorders for same-sex partnered men. Also, same-sex partnered women had a higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and plans, while same-sex partnered men had a higher prevalence of suicidal plans and attempts than their opposite-sex counterparts, although this finding was not statistically significant (Gilman et al., 2001). Some limitations of this study included potential limits on generalizability or representativeness due to the data being collected from 1990 to 1992, almost 10 years old by the time of the study and may not have been as representative of the population at that time, especially with the strides and setbacks in the progress of LGBTQ rights within society. Additionally, they excluded people who were not sexually active within five years before the 53   study, which could potentially exclude participants with certain characteristics, such as self-identified sexual orientation regardless of sexual behaviors or potentially people not engaging in sexual behaviors for reasons such as mental health concerns. The decision to collect the sexual activity data in the second part of the study may have been a limitation of this study. It seems that it could have been helpful to collect that demographic information in the initial phase, which could have allowed that sample to be larger. It also could have allowed for matching between those who screened positive for a lifetime disorder and those who did not, particularly with the potential for comparison between more individuals who engaged in same-sex behaviors. The same-sex partners subsample was a relatively small population and number of respondents compared to the overall sample size; while this was representative of the general population, it is likely that there was lower power because of the small number in the subsample. The smaller number of same-sex partnered participants also may have limited the opportunity for analysis of multiple subgroups within that sample, which may be why there was no distinguishment between participants with only same-sex partners and those with both same- and opposite-sex partners. This combining of individuals who only engaged in sexual behaviors with same-sex partners and individuals who engaged in sexual behaviors with both same-sex and opposite-sex partners likely conflates or misses characteristics unique to the differences and experiences of each of those populations, which could have an impact on the results found. Much like the previous study (Sandfort et al., 2001), this one used behaviorally defined versus identity defined sexual orientation. The authors noted that with using this definition they could not assess whether sexual identity played a role as a risk or protective factor, which they considered an important limitation because in relation to mental health sexual identity might be just as or more important than sexual behavior. 54   Additionally, some people who identify as homosexual or bisexual do not engage in sexual behaviors with people of the same-sex, while some people who do engage in sexual behaviors with people of the same-sex do not identify as homosexual or bisexual. This demonstrates that how sexual orientation is defined in a study impacts the demographics of and participants who are included in each subgroup of that study. The authors also indicated that there is variation in the acts used to define same-sex sexual behavior across studies, which also leads to measurement errors. The researchers chose to use the term intercourse. They acknowledged that with use of this word some participants with same-sex partners who did not engage in this behavior may have been excluded, relating to how the behavior is defined, as well as the uncertainty of how female same-sex respondents may have interpreted the item. Language must be considered when working with sexual minority individuals, especially when the language could have differing connotations than intended, be othering, or interpreted as heterocentric or heteronormative. These concerns around language have arisen around common assessments used for social anxiety as well (Weiss et al., 2013). Marital status, or heterosexual marriage rate, was assessed and was low among people who had same-sex partners compared to those with opposite-sex partners, while the cohabitation rate was higher among people who had same-sex partners. It is unclear what the purpose of including this variable was, particularly because same-sex marriage was not legal yet and domestic partnership or any comparable rights for same-sex couples was significantly limited at this time. So, it would make logical sense that the marriage rates would be lower among some of this subsample and that cohabitation rates would be higher (Gilman et al., 2001). A study by Wang et al. (2007) assessed the prevalence of SAD among gay men. This study, the Geneva Gay Men’s Health Survey, examined the 12-month prevalence of common 55   psychiatric disorders among gay men in Switzerland. They used a sampling method developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called time-space sampling in this cross-sectional venue-based probably survey. The authors used randomly selected venues or meeting points frequented by gay men in Geneva, then used randomly selected time slots, and randomly selected participants at each venue. Ultimately, recruitment occurred at 35 different meeting points including gay organization events, bars, cafes, discos, parties, sex clubs, saunas, parks, toilets, and internet chat rooms. This study recruited 1,153 eligible men who either identified as gay or as men who have sex with men. They advertised the study as a general health survey of gay men and participants were given a unique code to complete the first part of the questionnaire. If they were at a physical venue, they were asked to complete it on a laptop onsite, and if online they were asked to complete it at their leisure. The survey consisted of 550 questions assessing sociodemographic variables, mental and physical health, substance use, and stressors (Wang et al., 2007). The authors assessed the 12-month prevalence of major depression, specific phobia, social phobia, alcohol dependence, and drug dependence using the CIDI Short-Form (CIDI-SF; Kessler et al., 1998). They used questions from the Swiss Health Survey to assess self-reported history of depression and anxiety. They also used a general question from the Canadian Community Health Survey about mental health consultation with any health professional. Additionally, they used questions and recommended assessment instruments from the European Health Interview Survey (Buratta et al., 2003; de Bruin et al., 1996) to measure current subjective health and temporary mental disability through limitations in daily activities. They assessed quality of life with the Mental Health Inventory-5 (Buratta et al., 2003) to examine psychological distress and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief Version (Buratta et 56   al., 2003) to evaluate global quality of life, physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. To assess nominal and ordinal variables, they used contingency tables and chi-square tests. They used the t-test for continuous variables with normal distribution and they used analysis of variance with the Tukey test to analyze the continuous variable with a dependent variable (Wang et al., 2007). The study had 571 participants (50% response rate). The majority of the sample (83%) was under 44 years old, with 65.8% between the ages of 25 and 44 years old. Overall, the sample consisted of 63.6% of participants with a university education or other professional training, 78.9% with paid employment, 51.3% who lived in a large urban city, 57.4% who lived alone, and 59.9% who were not in a relationship (Wang et al., 2007). The 12-month prevalence rate for social phobia was 13.5% in this study. The researchers found that gay men reported higher prevalence and earlier onset of social phobia and the other psychiatric disordered assessed, as well as higher rates of comorbidity with another disorder, than rates found in heterosexual counterparts in previous studies of the general population. Many of these observations tended to relate with poor prognosis, greater treatment difficulty, and chronicity. Most sociodemographic variables were not significantly associated with a psychiatric disorder in the past 12 months, though there was increased risk for men who lived alone and men who were not in a relationship (Wang et al., 2007). Some limitations of this study included the cross-sectional nature, sampling from targeted locations for the specific population, and limited generalizability. Due to general difficulties sampling small, marginalized groups like the LGBTQ+ population through standard methods, this study used common meeting points where members of the gay male population tended to meet for leisure, socialization, or sex to recruit participants. While they used a sampling 57   procedure that has demonstrated robust coverage of this population in urban areas and should have allowed for fair representativity of this population, it may not be generalizable to gay men who did not engage in sex or go to any of these places. Additionally, this study was limited to participants who identified as gay men or men who had sex with men, and therefore did not generalize to the broader LGB population. The authors allowing the participants to identify themselves as gay and/or men who had sex with men reduced some concerns noted in other studies, though in analysis it does not seem that there was any differentiation between those two identities, which could lead to some of the same concerns around who was in the sample and who the sample was representing when considering sexual orientation identity versus sexual behaviors. The age range in the sample was also limited, though it appeared fairly similar to other prevalence studies that did not have many, if any, participants over age 54. Another challenge with the generalizability of the results is that the differences between the 50% of the recruited sample who agreed to participate compared to the half who did not participate are unknown. There could be particular characteristics of the participants that contributed to the results, leading to higher or lower prevalence rates. The reasons people chose not to participate could be related to factors such as mental health status that may be important barriers to know or address in the larger population (Wang et al., 2007). Meyer et al. (2008) completed a study examining the lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders in LGB individuals. They wanted to examine variability among the LGB population, particularly in the subgroups related to gender, race/ethnicity, age, and sexual orientation identity, because general population studies typically only have a few members of these populations and cannot provide information on variability. Participants were directly recruited at 274 venues including bookstores, cafes, social groups, parks, and snowball referrals. The authors 58   reported a response rate of 0.6 and a cooperation rate of 0.8. The authors collected data on sociodemographic data relating to age, sexual orientation, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status. The final sample consisted of 388 participants who were residents of New York City. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 59 years old, with 44% between 18 and 29 years old, 44% between 20 and 44 years old, and 12% between 45 and 59 years old. Participants self-identified as lesbian, gay (a combined 82%), or bisexual (18%); male (49.7%) or female (50.3%); and White (34%), Black (33%), or Latino (33%; Meyer et al., 2008). To assess DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses, the authors used the computer-assisted version of the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative of the CIDI version 19 (Kessler et al., 2005), which is the updated version of the previously discussed CIDI. The authors calculated unadjusted prevalence and standard error rates, then used logistic regression to find odds ratios and confidence intervals after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. In this study, 22.2% of the total sample reported a lifetime prevalence of social phobia. Of the sample, this included 23.8% of men, 20.5% of women, 21.1% of lesbian or gay individuals, and 27.1% of bisexual individuals (Meyer et al., 2008). While it appears that the authors were able to assess prevalence and variance between the subgroups of the LGB population, there were some limitations to this study and its generalizability. This study used a nonrandom sample and did not report using any methods to assist in randomizing the venues or participants selected for use in the study. The authors reported that they attempted to reduce bias by sampling diverse venues and avoiding venues that would overrepresent individuals with mental health disorders such as clinics and 12-step programs. As they found similar prevalence rates to other studies that did use random sampling, they indicated that this suggests the sample was not significantly unrepresentative of the general 59   LGB population. It is challenging to assess the significance or power of their findings because while they reported some of the demographics and prevalence rates, they did not report all of them, specifically not those divided into smaller subgroups. For example, one of their findings was that “Black lesbians, gay men, and bisexual individuals had lower prevalence of all disorders than Latino and White individuals” (Meyer et al., 2008, p. 1004), but they did not present data for specific subgroups such as Black lesbians, so the data this information come from cannot be examined and assessed or the meaning or significance determined. Additionally, while the main purpose of this study was to examine variability among the LGB population and its subgroups, some of the data they provided were combined. It is limiting that the researchers grouped gay, lesbian, and other individuals with similar identities such as queer, only separating out bisexual individuals, at least in the presented data. Previous studies have demonstrated some differences in the experiences of men and women, and therefore of gay men and lesbian women, so it would seem important that those groups were also considered separately. Related to the previous concern mentioned, it would seem that the authors did indeed consider these groups separately, otherwise mentioning specific groups like Black lesbians would be impossible, but for some reason they did not provide that separated data in the article, which again does not allow readers to assess the data for themselves (Meyer et al., 2008). A study by Bostwick et al. (2010) examined the lifetime prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders among adult men and women in the United States to explore if there were any differences in prevalence across three major dimensions of sexual orientation. The authors analyzed data from the second wave of the 2004-2005 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; Grant et al., 2004). This was a longitudinal study intending to assess the prevalence of alcohol, drug, and mental health disorders in the 60   noninstitutionalized general population of the United States. In the current study, they analyzed this cross-sectional data to assess lifetime and past-year prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders and the associations with three dimensions of sexual orientation and sex. Reportedly, the data came from a nationally representative sample of civilian adults in the United States who were 20 years of age or older. The original study utilized stratified sampling and clustering of the target population, as well as oversampling Black, Hispanic, and 18- to 24-year-old individuals. They also used sampling weights and adjustment of wave two data based on the 2000 Decennial census to offset inequalities and ensure the sample was representative of the U.S. population. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews that were completed in the participants’ homes (Bostwick et al., 2010). A total of 34,653 interviews were conducted with a response rate of 86.7% (Bostwick et al., 2010). Demographics that were assessed and included in the current analyses were sex, age, race, educational level, job status, income, health insurance coverage in the past year, and relationship status. The overall demographics of the sample were 70.9% White, 11% Black, 11.6% Hispanic, 4.3% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 2.2% American Indian; 52.1% female and 47.9% male; 73.1% between the ages of 25 and 64 years old, 58.5% education above high school, 87.7% with some form of health insurance coverage in the past year, 53% working full-time; and 63.8% married or cohabitating (Bostwick et al., 2010). Sexual orientation was assessed through questions asking about sexual identity, sexual behavior, and sexual attraction. Participants were asked to indicate which responses on a preprinted card best described them (sexual identity), their feelings (sexual attraction), and who they have had sex with in their life (sexual behavior). The sexual identities of the sample were 98.1% heterosexual, 0.8% lesbian or gay, 0.6% bisexual, and 0.5% unsure (a total of 1.4% 61   reporting nonheterosexual identity). The reported lifetime sexual behavior of participants was 94.6% only with the opposite-sex partners, 2% with no one, 1.9% with partners of both sexes, and 1.5% with only same-sex partners (a total of 3.4% reporting some same-sex sexual behavior). The sample’s reported sexual attraction was 94.2% only opposite-sex, 3% mostly opposite-sex, 1.4% only same-sex, 1% equally both sexes, and 0.4% mostly same-sex (a total of 5.8% reporting nonheterosexual attraction; Bostwick et al., 2010). The study assessed mood and anxiety disorders with the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-IV (AUDADIS-IV; Grant et al., 2004), a structured interview to be used by lay interviewers. The authors reported that reliability and validity had been assessed in previous research. The AUDADIS-IV assesses major depression, dysthymia, mania, hypomania, panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety. All disorders were assessed for lifetime and past-year occurrence (Bostwick et al., 2010). The authors conducted analyses with a statistical software specifically for use with correlated data in complex sample surveys called SUDAAN. They employed bivariate analysis to find associations for women and men separately, as well as for lifetime and past-year time frames. They then assessed the relationship between the three dimensions of sexual orientation and DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders using multiple logistic regression analyses to test for associations for women and men separately (Bostwick et al., 2010). Lifetime prevalence of social phobia for women by sexual identity was 9.6% for lesbians, 18.2% for bisexuals, and 13.6% for those unsure. By sexual attraction (in women), lifetime prevalence of social phobia was 6.5% for only female attraction, 12.4% for mostly female attraction, 13.4% for equal attraction, and 11% for mostly male attraction. By sexual behavior (in 62   women), lifetime prevalence of social phobia was 4% with women only, 15.5% with both women and men, and 11.1% with no one. Lifetime prevalence of social phobia for men by sexual identity was 12.4% for gays, 14.2% for bisexuals, and 15.6% for those unsure. By sexual attraction (in men), lifetime prevalence of social phobia was 9.2% for male only attraction, 7% for mostly male attraction, 7.9% for equal attraction, and 9.8% for mostly female attraction. By sexual behavior (in men), lifetime prevalence of social phobia was 6.1% with men only, 13.8% with both women and men, and 11.8% with no one. Past-year prevalence was found to be similar to lifetime prevalence rates. Ultimately, the study supported that the prevalence of mental health disorders varied by dimension of sexual orientation, while adding and emphasizing that risk patterns differed among women and men, and for specific sexual minority groups. For example, higher lifetime prevalence of disorder was generally associated with any sexual minority status for men, whereas for women, higher prevalence was associated with any sexual minority identity, but not for sexual attraction or behavior (Bostwick et al., 2010). The study had many strengths, including the sample size, methods, and language. The authors intentionally took steps to improve the design over preceding research. The authors reported that the data collected formed the largest national sample of sexual minority populations when the study was completed, which is very significant because it is exceedingly difficult to conduct research with minority populations, especially when they face societal stigma. Ideally, this would provide more power to find significant associations. Additionally, the national study appears very carefully considered and calculated to be representative of the U.S. population, which should allow the results to be more generalizable to the broader LGB population than they might otherwise be. With that said, the sample of sexual minority individuals is still a relatively small sample and was likely not representative of the 2010 U.S. population, especially if it was 63   adjusted to the 2000 census. By using multiple measures of sexual orientation, this study allowed comparison across those dimensions, which helps reduce concerns around how the subgroups are defined, whether there is under- or overrepresentation due to combining subgroups or worries about the mislabeling of participants or their identities and the actual construct they are trying to understand. In this study, the diagnoses were based on DSM-IV criteria and the measures were well-validated, allowing some certainty of the construct being measured and the applicability to current psychiatric diagnosis at the time. While this study used validated measures, they were still different than the measures used in other similar studies, which could ultimately still make it difficult to compare. The authors did control for a variety of demographic factors, which reduced the chance of confounding variables contributing to the associations found. Some limitations to this study included the use of cross-sectional data, limiting the kinds of knowledge that could be ascertained from the results. Additionally, the current study only used data from the second wave of the original survey because sexual orientation was not assessed in the first wave, so the authors noted that they could not examine temporal order or whether development of a minority sexual orientation identity preceded the mental health condition or vice versa. There is also the possibility that participants underreported information about themselves, especially when discussing sensitive information such as sexual behavior, identity, or attraction in a face-to-face interview format that left little anonymity when they could be concerned about judgment or discrimination. This study used lifetime sexual behavior, compared to the past year or the past five years as seen in other studies, making it more difficult to directly compare their results to the results of other studies. Much like measures establishing diagnosis, it may be important to standardize 64   sexual orientation measures, definitions, and wording or language in future research. The authors also noted that a number of variables were not taken into account, including participants’ level of disclosure or any experiences of discrimination related to their sexual identity, or past experiences of trauma or abuse, which are factors associated with mental health status among sexual minority groups. An additional question for this study is why they only used categories of sex, male and female, for the participants and their sexual partners were only same- or opposite-sex, when they included other options like “unsure” for sexual orientation. It would seem likely that some individuals may have had relations with people who did not identify within the binary and who may have neither been the same or opposite gender, which may have been challenging to classify without those options for participants. While factoring in gender may have been another layer that made the variables less clear, it could be an important variable that is not being considered in these results since it can often have significant meaning in how one defines their sexual orientation, attraction, and behaviors (Bostwick et al., 2010). In 2014, Sandfort et al. completed another study investigating the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in relation to sexual orientation and differences over time. This study was a replication and expansion of the first study. Their data came from the second Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS-2; de Graaf et al., 2012) which used a representative sample of the Dutch population aged 18 to 64 years of age to assess for psychiatric disorders. The survey used a multistage, stratified, random sampling procedure to recruit households in the Netherlands. One respondent per household was randomly selected for participation in the study. The authors used post-stratification weighting of demographic factors to ensure the sample had a distribution close to the general population. In total, 6,646 people were interviewed, with a 65.1% response rate of the eligible respondents. The study collected 65   sociodemographic information including sex, age, educational level, partnership status, and urbanicity. The sample demographics were a mean age of 44.3 years old and 55.2% women. Most participants had higher professional or university education, 67.8% were married or cohabitating with 20.8% living alone, 74.6% were employed, and 5.7% were of non-Western origin (Sandfort et al., 2014). The CIDI 3.0 (Kessler & Ustun, 2004) was used to determine DSM-IV diagnoses. The authors reported that the CIDI 3.0 has generally good validity for anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders. NEMESIS-2 assessed major depression, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia (without panic disorder), social phobia, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol and drug abuse and dependence, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder. Questions from the International Personality Disorder Examination (Huang et al., 2009) were also administered to assess anti-social personality disorder. These assessments were administered in face-to-face interviews with a laptop computer (Sandfort et al., 2014). Sexual orientation was assessed by means of asking participants about their sexual behavior and sexual attraction. They were asked about sexual contact over the preceding year and the sex of their partners and then categorized as either “homosexually active” (had sex with someone of the same sex) or heterosexually active. Next, they were asked to identify their sexual attraction from response options on a card that included “to women only,” “predominantly to women,” “to women and men equally,” “predominantly to men,” and “to men only.” Participants who expressed equal attraction or predominant or exclusive attraction to the same sex were categorized as same sex attracted. All others were categorized as heterosexually attracted. The 66   authors indicated that the bisexual behavior and bisexual attraction subgroups were too small to analyze on their own (Sandfort et al., 2014). The authors used bivariate analysis for men and women separately to assess for any confounding demographic variables and sexual orientation. They then used logistic regression analyses while controlling for age, education, residence, and relationship status to assess for differences in prevalence between “homosexually active” or same-sex attracted participants and heterosexual participants. These variables were controlled to allow for comparison with their first study. They then tested interaction effects of time and sexual behavior interactions to determine if there were any variations in disparities of prevalence between 1996 (NEMESIS-1) and 2007 to 2009 (NEMESIS-2; Sandfort et al., 2014).  Of the total sample, 2.2% of sexually active men and 2.0% of sexually active women engaged in same-sex sexual behavior, with 10% of those men and 19.3% of those women also engaging in opposite-sex sexual behavior. Additionally, same-sex attraction was reported by 2.5% of the men and 2.5% of the women. Bisexual or same-sex attraction was also described by 2.9% of sexually inactive men and 3.7% of sexually inactive women. The researchers found a higher 12-month prevalence of any anxiety disorder for men who engaged in same-sex behavior compared to men with only opposite-sex behavior. In particular, men who engaged in same-sex behavior were more likely to have experienced social phobia than men who engaged in opposite-sex behavior. Regarding lifetime prevalence, men who engaged in same-sex behavior were more likely to experience panic, drug abuse, and comorbid disorders than men who engaged in opposite-sex behavior. Same-sex attraction yielded similar results, with men who experience same-sex attraction having a higher likelihood of 12-month prevalence of major depressive disorder and lifetime experience of any mood disorder, major depression, social phobia, and 67   general anxiety disorders than men who experience opposite-sex attraction. Women who engaged in same-sex behavior were more likely to have experienced bipolar, alcohol dependence, and drug dependence in the previous 12 months and alcohol and drug dependence during their life than women who engaged opposite-sex behavior. Mood and anxiety disorders were more likely in the previous 12 months for women who reported same-sex attraction compared to women who reported opposite-sex attraction, including social phobia specifically. Lifetime prevalence of any mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder was more likely for women with same-sex attraction than women with opposite-sex attraction, including alcohol and drug dependence, dysthymia, and social phobia. In this study they found the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of social phobia for men by behavior-based orientation (bisexually and homosexually active) was 12.3% and 17.8%, respectively, and by attraction-based orientation (same-sex attracted) were 12.1% and 20.1%, respectively. The 12-month and lifetime prevalence of social phobia for women by behavior-based orientation (bisexually and homosexually active) were 12.2% and 20.2%, respectively, and by attraction-based orientation (same-sex attracted) were 15.3% and 25.3%, respectively (Sandfort et al., 2014). This study appears thorough. The authors made adjustments based on newer research since the first iteration of this study, which improved many of the concerns noted before. For example, they broadened the definition of sexual orientation, albeit by adding just one more dimension, but it still demonstrated some significant differences and emphasized the importance of using more than one, rigid definition of sexual orientation. They also included and analyzed data for participants who did not have sexual partners over the past year, which demonstrated higher prevalence rates overall for both homosexual and heterosexual groups. Some limitations of the study included small sample sizes of some subgroups that did not allow for analysis to 68   better understand how the interaction of or differences between sexual behavior and attraction contribute to the variations found. Additionally, while previous research has shown the importance of splitting groups based upon exclusively homosexual orientation and bisexual orientation, they were unable to do so in this study, and therefore, some disparities between the homosexual group and the heterosexual group may not be as significant or accurate as what was found. Another challenge with a small sample size is the lowered power to identify significant differences (Sandfort et al., 2014). In examining the preceding studies on prevalence of mental health disorders, with pointed interest in social anxiety and social phobia among LGB individuals, it is notable that social anxiety can substantially affect the everyday life of many LGB individuals. While there was nuance and moderate variation in the research findings, it is evident that there tended to be higher prevalence of social anxiety among LGB individuals overall. At a quick glance, it can be estimated that the 12-month prevalence of social anxiety among LGB individuals was somewhere between 7% (Sandfort et al., 2001) and 15.3% (Sandfort et al., 2014), while the lifetime prevalence was between 4% (Bostwick et al., 2010) and 27.1% (Meyer et al., 2008). This range seems to indicate that there may be meaningful differences in the distribution and experience of social anxiety, particularly between unique subgroups. The prevalence rates found in research thus far include 12-month prevalence of 7.3% for homosexual men and 7.0% for homosexual women (Sandfort et al., 2001); 8.8% for same-sex partnered men and 10.4% for same-sex partnered women (Gilman et al., 2001); 12.1% (attraction-based) to 12.3% (behavior-based) for men and 12.2% (behavior-based) to 15.3% (attraction-based) for women (Sandfort et al., 2014); and 13.5% (Wang et al., 2007). Lifetime prevalence of social phobia was between 4% and 18.2% for nonheterosexual women (defined by behavior, identity, or attraction) and between 69   6.1% and 15.6% for nonheterosexual men (defined by behavior, identity, or attraction; Bostwick et al., 2010); 14.6% for homosexual men and 18.6% for homosexual women (Sandfort et al., 2001); 17.8% (behavior-based) to 20.1% (attraction-based) for men and 20.2% (behavior-based) to 25.3% (attraction-based) for women (Sandfort et al., 2014); and 22.2% total including 23.8% of men, 20.5% of women, 21.1% of lesbian or gay individuals, and 27.1% of bisexual individuals (Meyer et al., 2008). Overall, the research studies reviewed appeared to be of quality and the concerns that arose were fairly similar to those addressed in discussing the previous research. While generalization to the broader population is often a concern, in this section half of the studies were from the United States and the other half were from Western Europe, indicating significantly less variation in the populations studied, which could mean that the results may be more representative and comparable for those populations. However, it does provide a narrow view of SAD in the LGB community and will make it more challenging to compare these sections on prevalence. Over time, the authors in a number of these studies seemed to take intentional steps to improve the study design over preceding research, versus completing a number of similar or flawed studies, whether it was improvements to sample size, methods, or language. The use of cross-sectional designs has limitations and does not allow for exploration of causation, but this might not be as important since it is not the main focus of prevalence studies. The primary goal of most of these studies was solely to look at and compare prevalence rates, which is a significant distinction from the studies in the previous section. Many of these studies used large, representative samples that were carefully randomized and selected. These larger and more representative samples likely made these results more generalizable than some of the other research that has been explored thus far, particularly to the 70   broader LGB population. Larger numbers of participants also allowed more exploration between groups than in some smaller studies. In one study, it was noted that they had the largest national sample of sexual minority populations to date, which is significant because it is remarkably difficult to conduct research with minority populations, especially when they face societal stigma. Ideally, this would provide more power to find significant associations. A challenge to large, representative samples of the general population was that there were still a relatively small number of LGB individuals, which at times still led to them being grouped together instead of considered separately and certainly may have masked or inflated results for the broader LGB population when variation was possibly more accurately attributable to a specific subgroup. For example, combining individuals who only engaged in sexual behaviors with same-sex partners and individuals who engaged in sexual behaviors with both same-sex and opposite-sex partners likely conflated or missed characteristics unique to the differences and experiences of each of those populations, which could have an impact on the results found. Another odd choice in one study was combining gay, lesbian, and other similar identities such as queer into one subgroup, only separating out bisexual individuals. Previous research has demonstrated some differences in the experiences of men and women, and therefore of gay men and lesbian women, so it would seem important that those groups were also considered separately. A significant critique for a number of these studies is how they defined and measured sexual orientation, especially if they primarily used one dimension such as sexual behaviors that were engaged in over attraction or self-identification. This did improve in more recent studies, which is a positive progression, though the insistence of some researchers to use behavioral based categorization despite the demonstrated importance of identity was questionable. Differing methods may also relate to the variation among response rates reported in different studies. For 71   example, how sexual orientation is operationalized in a study does change the results of the study, which indicates a similar concern that was noted before around the measurement of the construct and the challenge of comparing between studies when they may not have the whole or same picture. Additionally, there was variation in the acts or timeframes used to define same-sex sexual behavior across studies, which also led to measurement errors. For example, if some studies assessed for sexual behavior in the last year, others in the last five years, and others lifetime, the samples and ultimately the findings could vary significantly. By excluding partners or sexual behaviors beyond a year or five years and only examining partners and behaviors within a shortened timeframe, it seems likely that many people may be excluded that could have added to each group or that people who do hold a sexual minority identity that is not depicted by recent sexual behaviors may have been miscategorized. In one study, it seemed helpful that the authors allowed the participants to identify themselves as gay and/or men who had sex with men, as this reduced some concerns noted in other studies around accuracy of categorization for sample participants and subgroups. In another study, the participants were able to identify their sexual identity as part of their orientation, which was important because research has begun to look at the importance of identity in relation to mental health and development. Identity and how one relates to their sexual identity is a pertinent piece of the puzzle that strictly behaviorally defined orientation misses because there are people who sleep with members of the same sex or gender and do not identify as homosexual at all. So, including these people in a sample where they do not hold a sexual minority identity may impact or skew the results, as they likely do not have the same experiences as people who do hold that identity. Additionally, in all the studies that used behavioral definitions of sexual orientation, it is either unclear if they asked the circumstances in which the sexual behaviors occurred or unlikely when a question of that nature 72   was not described while assessment of orientation was. It could be possible that some people had same-sex sexual encounters with multiple partners at once and that situation may not be reflective of their identity. By using multiple measures of sexual orientation, some studies allowed comparison across those dimensions, which helped reduce concerns around how the subgroups were defined, whether there was under- or overrepresentation due to combining subgroups or worries about the mislabeling of participants or their identities and the actual construct they were trying to understand. An additional factor noted throughout these studies was the general exclusion of gender and instead the use of sex. Participants were usually categorized as male or female and their sexual partners were either same- or opposite-sex, even in studies where they included other options such as “unsure” for sexual orientation. It is possible that some individuals may have engaged in sexual behavior with or attraction to people who did not identify within the binary and who may have neither been the same or opposite gender, which may have been challenging to classify without those options for participants. It is possible that factoring in gender may have added another layer that made the variables less clear, but it could be an important or confounding variable that is not being considered in the results since it can often have significant relevance in how one defines their sexual orientation, attraction, and behaviors. Another difference in methods includes varying demographics being collected, reported, considered, and analyzed across studies. Some studies collected a series of demographics and report them, regardless of whether they analyze them, and others collected seemingly few demographics or did not directly report them or fully describe their sample. When the demographics collected or reported were limited, it limited the factors that could be compared or examined and it created challenges in knowing the population that was being discussed and how 73   the sample compared to the broader population. In some studies, the authors reported controlling for a variety of demographic factors to reduce the chance of confounding variables contributing to the associations found, which could alleviate the concern arising in other studies when there was uncertainty about what factors were being analyzed or if any were even controlled for. One study noted something important that may have not even been considered in the other studies, which was acknowledging that several factors associated with mental health status among sexual minority groups were not considered, such as the participants’ level of disclosure, any experiences of discrimination related to their sexual identity, or past experiences of trauma or abuse. Another sociodemographic-background-related challenge that may limit the generalizability of most of these studies was that there was a fair amount of recruited people who did not respond or participate in all the studies. The differences between the recruited sample who agreed to participate compared to the rest who did not participate are not known. There could be unique characteristics of those who did participate and those who did not participate that contributed to the results, leading to either higher or lower prevalence rates. The reasons people chose to respond or not could be related to important factors such as mental health status, stigma, or lack of information and resources, which may be important barriers to consider or address in the larger population. These studies tended to use reliable, validated, and standardized diagnostic instruments that were based on clinical diagnostic criteria. The majority of the studies used varying versions of the CIDI, which actually provide some consistency and comparability that is lacking in a great deal of other research. However, while the quality of the instruments may be good and similar across these studies, they are still different than ones used in other studies on SAD, the LGB population, and college students, which could ultimately make it difficult to compare all the 74   findings. In some instances, it seemed that the data collected, or the instruments used, were outdated when something newer could have been used. It seems that this may just be a part of the nature of these large, national prevalence studies due to the time it takes to plan, organize, gather data, and use validated instruments. It may be unfortunate that this is the case simply because publishing data that are 5 or 10 years old, particularly relating to trends and changes in the population, are likely no longer an accurate representation of the population. Almost all these studies primarily used a face-to-face interview format to administer the measures to their participants. Therefore, there is a possibility that participants underreported information about themselves, especially when discussing sensitive information such as sexual behavior, identity, attraction, and mental health with little anonymity and potential concerns about judgment or discrimination from others. Finally, there was considerable variance in the use of language across studies, which relates to challenges with definitions and categorization of groups and people, though some of the fluctuating terminology may be related to social progress as the appropriate verbiage within the LGB community or research world changes over time. For this reason, it seems important that language is intentionally considered and deliberately chosen when working with sexual minority individuals, especially when the language could have differing connotations, be othering, or is heterocentric or heteronormative. For instance, one study made the choice to use the term intercourse. They acknowledged that some participants with same-sex partners who did not engage in this behavior may have been excluded, which relates to how sexual behavior is defined, as well as the uncertainty of how female same-sex respondents may have interpreted the item. These concerns around language have also arose around common assessments used for social anxiety (Weiss et al., 2013) where the questions may ask about people of the opposite-sex 75   or gender and therefore would likely not be a sufficient assessment of an LGB person’s social anxiety. Much like measures establishing diagnosis, it may be important to attempt to standardize sexual orientation measures, sexual orientation definitions, and general and categorical language in future research to allow for inclusion, consistency, and accuracy. SAD in LGB College Students Thus far, this paper has explored the challenges faced by college students and LGB individuals overall regarding SAD and the impact that it can have on their experiences. While understanding how SAD impacts these two groups in general, it is important to understand the intersection of the impact of SAD specifically on LGB college students, as these students may have varying experiences when these two identities meet to create potentially unique stressors and challenges. College campuses can be unwelcoming and uncomfortable for sexual minority students (Woodford et al., 2015). LGB students experience greater psychological distress and decreased social well-being during the first year of undergraduate studies compared to heterosexual peers (Kirsch et al., 2015). LGB students reported greater levels of psychological distress across the first year in addition to the elevated levels of distress that they began college with (Kirsch et al., 2015). Additionally, studies of LGBTQ college/university students have found higher prevalence of depression, suicidal behavior, and addictive behavior compared to heterosexual peers, which appears to support the minority stress theory suggesting that sexual orientation relationship stress is related to worse mental health (Peltzer & Pengpid, 2016). There has been limited research examining social anxiety among LGB college students in particular and no studies were found that investigated the prevalence of social anxiety in this specific population. While some studies were found that did investigate LGB college student mental health or social 76   anxiety specifically, they did not measure or attain prevalence. These studies did demonstrate an increase of social anxiety for gay and bisexual men over time (Pachankis et al., 2018) and that gay men reported more anxiety than heterosexual men across many domains (Pachankis & Goldfried, 2006). Additionally, some studies have found that there may also be variation of these trends among the LGB subgroups themselves. For example, one study found that bisexual and other sexual identities (not gay and lesbian) endorsed higher levels of social anxiety than lesbian/gay and heterosexual peers, while lesbian/gay individuals rated similar levels of social anxiety as heterosexual peers (Wadsworth & Hayes-Skelton, 2015). As demonstrated by examining all the previous studies, attempting to measure the prevalence of SAD for a population with minimal research requires exercise of caution not only in comparing the research related to each of these populations to extrapolate probabilities related to the population of interest, but also in considering the overall prevalence of SAD in general. Overall, the research appears to be of quality and well designed. However, as demonstrated by Furmark (2002), and noticed above, there is variation in the methods used across studies to categorize and measure social anxiety. Even small changes in how SAD was defined or categorized can significantly skew the prevalence estimates that are found, which is a challenge in attempting to compare the results of the studies, but additionally adds a challenge to determine which results are most accurate as well. In addition to how SAD is categorized and defined, there is variation in how sexual orientation is defined and measured across studies, which can skew the sample and impact the results as well. Gilman et al. (2001) even mentioned that the variation in the acts used to define same-sex sexual behavior across studies could also lead to measurement errors. With that said, the previously reviewed research indicated that the prevalence of SAD among college students is likely between 8.5% (Bella & Omigbodun, 2009) and 80% (Ahmad et 77   al., 2017), with the majority of studies falling between 16.4% and 32.8%. It was also demonstrated that the prevalence of SAD among LGB individuals is likely between 7% (Sandfort et al., 2001) and 15.3% (Sandfort et al., 2014) for 12-month prevalence and between 4% (Bostwick et al., 2010) and 27.1% (Meyer et al., 2008) for lifetime prevalence, with the majority of lifetime prevalence falling between 14.6% and 27.1%. It would appear that both of these populations demonstrate some common overlap for the majority of the studies indicating prevalence between 14.6% and 32.8% in the middle range. It would seem likely that the prevalence of SAD for LGB college students would be comparable to this range, with a note that the actual prevalence may be somewhat higher, especially for students with any sexual orientation that includes people with same and different sex/gender from their own.   78   Chapter III: RISK FACTORS FOR SAD As noted in the previous chapter, there is a high prevalence of social anxiety among college students and within the LGB population, which is presumed to indicate that it is likely there is a significant prevalence of social anxiety in the LGB college student population as well. With awareness about the importance of social support for LGB individuals and the challenges that transitioning into young adulthood and college life can pose, it is paramount to understand how LGB students experience social anxiety and the impact it may have on their development and success. This leads to the second question in this project, which is examining the potential risks and contributing factors to social anxiety among LGB college students. The hypothesis was that the factors that contribute social anxiety among LGB college students are an intersection of those factors that contribute to social anxiety for other LGB individuals and other college students, such as identity development, social support, minority stress, and significant life transitions. This chapter examines factors that contribute to social anxiety and the LGB experience to explore the potential risks and challenges for this population, including general etiological factors, developmental issues, gender role nonconformity, abusive and negative family experiences, stigmatizing attitudes, self-concealment, and sexual orientation victimization. General Risk Factors for SAD The general risk factors for SAD among LGB individuals include etiological factors that are common to all individuals (Higa-McMillan & Ebesutani, 2011). Examining SAD through a developmental framework, research has proposed that factors influencing psychopathology include predisposing factors, precipitating factors, and maintaining factors, though SAD can be developed through a variety of developmental pathways, regardless of having predisposing 79   factors or experiencing precipitating factors (Higa-McMillan & Ebesutani, 2011). Predisposing factors may include genetic vulnerabilities, neurobiological vulnerabilities, inhibited temperament, poor attachment, and negative parenting styles (Higa-McMillan & Ebesutani, 2011). Precipitating factors may include negative life events, such as childhood stressors like abuse, illness, or family conflict, or direct or indirect exposure to conditioning experiences such as socially traumatic events (Higa-McMillan & Ebesutani, 2011). Maintaining factors would include any factor that leads to the persistence of SAD, which can include any predisposing factors or precipitating factors, as well as issues such as social skills deficits and cognitive biases (Higa-McMillan & Ebesutani, 2011). Research with population data indicates that young people who experience abuse as children or adolescents are more likely to have impaired psychosocial functioning, such as social problems and SAD (Silverman et al., 1996). For example, in a study on early negative life events, Binelli et al. (2012) found that university students in Spain who indicated high levels of social anxiety reported higher prevalence of negative events early in life. They specifically found a positive correlation between family violence in childhood and social anxiety, concluding that family violence could be a risk factor for social anxiety among the college population (Binelli et al., 2012). Higher levels of social anxiety (Craig, 1998; Walters & Inderbitzen, 1998) and lower levels of social acceptance (Callaghan & Joseph, 1995) are displayed more in children who experience higher levels of peer victimization than children who experience lower levels of victimization. For example, there was a statistically significant and positive correlation found between college students who reported a history of childhood teasing and scores on measures of anxiety sensitivity and social anxiety (Roth et al., 2002). Anxiety sensitivity, which may be a 80   significant factor in the development and continuation of social anxiety (Gore et al., 2002), relates to a predisposition to fear the potential negative consequences of experiencing anxious sensations that may arise from distressing thoughts or beliefs about those experiences (Hazen et al., 1994; Scott et al., 2000). It is possible that the world begins to be perceived as a dangerous place by children who are victimized and they may learn that they need to be hypervigilant and alert, which could lead to difficulties with anxiety, particularly in social situations (Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011). The idea that social situations are dangerous and will end in failure is reinforced when negative situations like those involving victimization are directly experienced (Clark & Wells, 1995; Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). In one study examining correlates of social anxiety among Chinse university students, Cheng et al. (2017) explored lifestyle, social, personality, and mental health factors of incoming university students reporting experiences of social anxiety symptoms. The study found that factors associated with high levels of social anxiety symptoms included being an undergraduate student, being a nonsmoker, having poor social support, experiencing internet addiction, poor sleep, engaging in less altruistic behavior, and experiencing suicidal ideation (Cheng et al., 2017). Higher levels of social anxiety symptoms were also noted among undergraduate students than graduate students in this study (Cheng et al., 2017). As explored above, some general risk factors for SAD that likely impact LGB individuals include genetic vulnerabilities, neurobiological vulnerabilities, inhibited temperament, poor attachment, negative parenting styles, negative life events, childhood stressors such as illness, abuse, family conflict, direct or indirect exposure to socially traumatic events, family violence, and peer victimization (Binelli et al., 2012; Callaghan & Joseph, 1995; Craig, 1998; Higa-McMillan & Ebesutani, 2011; Roth et al., 2002; Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011; Silverman et al., 81   1996; Walters & Inderbitzen, 1998). Additionally, many factors such as being an undergraduate student, not smoking, poor social support, internet addiction, poor sleep, reduced altruistic behavior, and suicidal ideation are associated with high levels of social anxiety symptoms (Cheng et al., 2017). These factors can be taken into consideration when working with LGB college students and understanding their experiences or implementing interventions and programs to target specific student groups. General Mental Health and SAD-Specific Risk Factors for LGB Individuals While general etiological factors for SAD that are experienced by the broader population likely play a role in the development of SAD among LGB individuals, there are also factors of concern that relate specifically to the LGB population that may play a role in the development of SAD as well. This section discusses some general mental health risk factors among LGB individuals that are important to consider regarding broader LGB mental health and factors that impact overall mental health and well-being. Then, this section goes on to explore some LGB-specific risk factors that may relate to the development of SAD among the LGB community. Research indicates that minority stress plays a role in the well-being of LGB people and impacts their mental health, as a positive correlation between minority stress and negative mental health outcomes has been found among LGB adolescents and adults (Dürrbaum & Sattler, 2020; Eaton, 2014; Feinstein et al., 2012; Kuyper & Fokkema, 2011; Newcomb & Mustanski, 2010; Pachankis et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2010; Sattler et al., 2017; Szymanski & Sung, 2010). In one small study conducting interviews with LGB youth who were experiencing depression and suicidal ideation, the most frequent causes of psychological distress identified by the youth were rejection from their family because of their sexual orientation, sexual orientation victimization 82   from individuals outside of their family, and negative family events that were not related to their sexual orientation (Diamond et al., 2011). Additionally, while Fish and Pasley (2015) found similar levels of depressive symptoms and suicidality among individuals who first reported same-sex attraction and a sexual minority identity in adulthood and those who reported in adolescence, they did note that worsening mental health in adulthood was associated with later changes in attraction, behavior, and identity. Specifically, they noted greater risk for development of depressive symptoms and excessive alcohol use in individuals who become aware of or acknowledged their sexual minority attraction or did not incorporate their attraction into their identity until later stages of their development. Ueno (2010) also found that when individuals take on a stigmatized identity, there is an increased risk of poor mental health. Further, barriers to societal integration, which include not living with a partner or children, unemployment, and lack of societal trust, were found to be higher among LGB individuals compared to heterosexual individuals and these barriers partially explained the higher risk and prevalence of suicide among LGB individuals (Bränström et al., 2020). Additionally, lack of support socially and culturally from institutions that shape the lives of LGBTQ youth, such as schools, families, and faith institutions, limits the rights and protections of LGBTQ individuals and can make them vulnerable to negative experiences (Russell & Fish, 2016). For example, research has demonstrated that LGBTQ youth in schools with specific policies related to nondiscrimination and antibullying for gender and sexual minority individuals report less victimization and harassment than students in schools without those policies (Kosciw et al., 2014), and LGBTQ youth in areas with fewer protective policies for gender and sexuality minority individuals are more likely to report suicide attempts within 83   the last year compared to youth in areas where protective policies are common (Hatzenbuehler & Keyes, 2013). Other social environment characteristics at the county level associated with a lower risk of suicide among LGB youth were the proportion of same-sex couples and registered Democrats (Hatzenbuehler, 2011; Hatzenbuehler & Keyes, 2013). This impact also stretches to the laws and policies that are in place at the broader societal level, and while there are only a few studies that specifically examine the relationship between laws, policies, and mental health, it is generally accepted that these constructs form the conditions that affect minority stress and mental health (Russell & Fish, 2016). For example, Rostosky et al. (2009) found that after an election cycle in states where the ballot contained measures to ban same-sex marriage there were higher reports of psychological distress among the LGB individuals who lived there and Hatzenbuehler et al. (2010) found that LGB adults who lived in states where same-sex marriage was banned had higher rates of psychiatric disorders. In addition to the etiological factors that can impact any young adult and potentially lead to onset of SAD, other factors that have been investigated in the literature as potential variables that might contribute to increased social anxiety in the LGB community include developmental issues, gender role nonconformity, abusive and negative family experiences, self-concealment, and sexual orientation victimization (Bailey & Zucker, 1995; Corliss et al., 2002; Garofalo et al., 1998; Poteat et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2011). Developmental Issues Higher levels of social anxiety found among LGBTQ youth may be partially explained by the lifelong challenges of feeling different from others and knowing that the way in which one is different is considered unacceptable by broader society (Bostwick et al., 2010; Pachankis & Goldfried, 2006; Safren & Pantalone, 2006), and social anxiety, among other mental health 84   concerns, may be an outcome, if not a key determinant, for sexual minority individuals who expect rejection from others, and from heterosexuals in particular (Hart & Heimberg, 2001; Meyer, 2003). D’Augelli (2002) noted that awareness of the social conflict with one’s sexual orientation or gender identity may begin around 10 to 11 years old, with many youths reporting even earlier that they feel different from others, though they often do not disclose their identity until many years later. It is posed that social anxiety may play a role in this delay (D’Augelli, 2002; D’Augelli et al., 2006; D’Augelli & Hershberger, 1993; Roberts et al., 2011) and D’Augelli (2002) noted that development for LGBTQ individuals has the added obstacles of negative evaluation from society that likely have an impact (Rotheram-Borus & Langabeer, 2001). Young people’s experiences with romantic relationships are a normal and significant fundamental piece of their development, and these relationships can offer support, which may act as a protective factor for LGB youth (Collins et al., 2009; Russell & Fish, 2016). However, there can be many barriers to dating same-sex partners, such as limited opportunities for romantic partners, minority stress related to pursuing romantic relationships, and constraints on same-sex relationships in academic settings, which might result in LGB youth seeking out other social settings such as bars and clubs, potentially increasing risky behaviors (Mustanski et al., 2014; Russell & Fish, 2016). Diamond and Lucas (2004) also found that when it comes to finding compatible partners and general dating, LGB youth report less initiative and more fear. These added challenges to dating have the potential to impact development from adolescence through later life stages (Frost, 2011; Mustanski et al., 2014; Russell, Watson & Muraco, 2012). 85   Gender Role Nonconformity Regardless of their sexual orientation, gender diverse people are more likely to face discrimination, stigma, and victimization from a young age (Corliss et al., 2002; Fagot, 1977; Feinstein et al., 2012; Horn, 2007; Jacobson et al., 2016; Smith & Leaper, 2006; Toomey et al., 2012; Zucker et al., 1995), with gender diverse youth reporting more experiences of victimization, mental health problems, and traumatic stress (D’Augelli et al., 2006) and gender nonconformity in childhood being significantly associated with rejection sensitivity, depression, social anxiety, and experiences of discrimination (Feinstein et al., 2012). Many sexual minority youth believe that others can easily identify them as LGBTQ, which may be partially due to their own awareness that they may not present according to traditional gender expectations (Roberts et al., 2011). D’Augelli and Hershberger (1993) found that indivdiuals who percevied themselves as more representative of characteristics of the opposite gender than their peers, for example young men who perceived themselves as more feminine than other men, felt that they were more identifiable as a sexual minority than other LGBTQ people. D’Augelli et al. (2006) found that sexual minority men perceived their parents’ reactions to gender atypical behaviors more negatively than sexual minority women, which appears consistent with findings from Kane (2006) indicating that parents seemed more accepting of these behaviors among young girls compared to young boys. Further research has indicated that as early as preschool and continuing through adolescence, boys who are gender nonconforming are subjected to more criticism, ridicule, and rejection by peers, teachers, and family than gender-conforming boys (Fagot, 1977; Horn, 2007; Jacobson et al., 2016; Landolt et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 2013; Zucker et al., 1995). Some research has shown a relationship between early gender nonconformity and later development of anxiety, notably for gay men 86   (Lippa, 2008; Weinrich et al., 1995), as well as an association between self-reported levels of gender nonconformity and higher levels of trait anxiety among gay men, but not lesbians (Skidmore et al., 2006). According to research, gay men are more likely to engage in gender nonconforming behaviors such as speaking, walking, or dressing in ways that are considered effeminate (Lippa, 2000, 2005, 2008; Rieger et al., 2008) and engagement in these behaviors can increase the chances of an individual being identified as gay and possibly targeted for victimization (Skidmore et al., 2006). Indeed, findings from a large-scale study of Latino gay and bisexual men showed that those who described themselves as more effeminate were more likely to have been physically and sexually abused, with the link between gender atypicality and mental distress, including reports of anxiety, being mediated by homophobic experiences (Sandfort et al., 2007). Jacobson et al. (2016) completed a study examining effects of gender nonconforming behavior and sexual orientation on interaction anxiety among Israeli men. They thought that gay men might be more likely to experience anxiety in social interactions partially due to worries about rejection or negative evaluation because of their sexual orientation. However, they found that self-reported perceptions of gender atypicality and heterosexual orientation predicted higher levels of social interaction anxiety, but no significant interactions were found between sexual orientation and gender behavior. With an inverse relationship, individuals reported being more anxious the less masculine they thought others perceived them to be. This led Jacobson et al. (2016) to conclude that perhaps gender atypicality may play more of a role in increasing risk for anxiety than sexual orientation, as other researchers have suggested that the correlations between same-sex attraction and anxiety that have been found throughout the research body may be 87   mediated by gender nonconformity, specifically negative reactions to gender nonconformity (Rieger & Savin-Williams, 2012). In a study conducted by Van Beusekom et al. (2016) researchers examined the relationship between homophobic peer victimization, gender nonconformity, and mental health among adolescent boys. In their sample, there was a significant positive correlation between same-sex attraction and gender nonconformity and experiences of homophobic name-calling, social anxiety, and psychological distress. They found significant positive correlations between gender nonconformity and social anxiety, psychological distress, and homophobic name-calling. They also observed a significant positive relationship between homophobic name-calling and social anxiety and psychological distress. In exploring the effects of homophobic name-calling, they learned that it partially mediated the relationships between gender nonconformity and both social anxiety and psychological distress, though gender nonconformity was still significantly related to both without considering homophobic name-calling (van Beusekom et al., 2016). In considering other moderating factors, van Beusekom et al. (2016) found a significant interaction between gender nonconformity and sexual attraction whereby the positive relationship between gender nonconformity and homophobic name-calling increased as same-sex attraction increased. These findings were only significant for individuals with mean and high levels of same-sex attraction, but not for individuals with low same-sex attraction, interestingly. The researchers noted that this difference in levels of same-sex attraction may indicate that feelings of same-sex attraction play a role in possible experience of victimization, as individuals were not targeted by others exclusively due to their gender expression, though this may relate to other factors relating to their sample, such as level of outness or openness about gender identity and sexual orientation or their ages as young adolescents (van Beusekom et al., 2016). This study 88   adds to the body of research with results indicating that sexual minority youth report experiencing more psychological distress, including social anxiety, which in part is impacted by their sexual orientation, gender nonconformity, and experiences of sexual orientation victimization to varying degrees. Abusive and Negative Family Experiences The challenges faced by LGBTQ youth in the community also occur within their families, which creates an additional layer of stress because of how important parental and familial relationships are for the well-being of young people (Steinberg & Duncan, 2002). Many youth are afraid to come out to others, especially to their parents (Potoczniak et al., 2009), due to fears of being rejected, disappointing others, hurting others, rupturing their relationships, and even verbal or physical abuse (D’Augelli et al., 1998; Roberts et al., 2011; Ryan et al., 2009). Therefore, many LGBTQ youth may experience distress and symptoms of social anxiety in their home environment (Hart & Heimberg, 2001). In a study completed by D’Augelli et al. (2008), it was estimated that 30% to 40% of parents have a negative response to their children’s disclosure of their sexual orientation, though the likelihood of a negative response was often overestimated by LGB youth. In another study, Pachankis et al. (2008) noted that over a quarter of their sample was not out to at least one parent and, compared to individuals who had disclosed their sexual orientation to their parents, there was significantly higher internalized homophobia among those who had not disclosed. More fear of rejection and internalized homophobia was reported by the individuals who had not shared their orientation with their parents, while youth who worried less about rejection reported positive reactions from their parents (D’Augelli et al., 2008). This fear is understandable, as rejection can have significant consequences such as increased verbal or physical harassment (D’Augelli et al., 1998) and homelessness (Durso & Gates, 2012). 89   Individuals who experience family rejection have higher risks of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts (D’Augelli, 2002; Rosario et al., 2009; C. Ryan et al., 2009). In one study on family rejection of gay and lesbian individuals, Carastathis et al. (2017) found common themes around the impact of familial rejection including development of a negative identity, poor mental health, and self-destructive behaviors. Some of the participants acknowledged an early dissatisfaction with their sexuality due to societal perceptions that being a sexual minority was wrong or abnormal and a general lack of acceptance for sexual minority individuals, which were reinforced by family rejection (Carastathis et al., 2017). For many participants, this led to internalization of negative family attitudes and negative attitudes about themselves such as feeling wrong, abnormal, worthless, and self-hatred (Carastathis et al., 2017). Some questioned their identity and felt a confusion or a pressure to conform to heterosexuality (Carastathis et al., 2017). Other consequences of familial rejection included poor mental health and self-destructive behaviors such as intense distress, depression, and coping through self-harm, drug, and alcohol use (Carastathis et al., 2017). Some reported use of self-harm as a maladaptive coping strategy to reduce and manage intense emotions, while others also used self-harm as self-punishment in relation to experienced self-hatred (Carastathis et al., 2017). It was common among participants to cope with distress through the use of drugs and alcohol, whether for escape or as an act of rebellion (Carastathis et al., 2017). In some participants the levels of distress were so intense that they experienced suicidal ideation with some also reporting suicide attempts (Carastathis et al., 2017). Carastathis et al. (2017) concluded that rejection by family members can impede an individual’s ability to cope and create significant adversity for sexual minority individuals. 90   Pachankis et al. (2018) examined a construct called parental unfinished business, which they described as “persistent, unresolved negative thoughts and feelings towards one’s parents,” (p. 1068) in relation to experiences of parental rejection among sexual minority men. They found that parental unfinished business was a separate construct from parental rejection and had unique relationships with mental health outcomes, including a significant association with depressive and social anxiety symptoms. These results further emphasize the impact and challenges that can arise among sexual minority individuals from a lack of support, acceptance, or added conflict in their family relationships. There is a high prevalence of reported childhood verbal, physical, and sexual abuse among LGBTQ adults (Corliss et al., 2002; Grossman & D’Augelli, 2007; Kenagy, 2005; Pilkington & D’Augelli, 1995; Tomeo et al., 2001), often perpetrated by family members, particularly parents (Corliss et al., 2002; Rivers & D’Augelli, 2001) and at higher rates than heterosexual youth (Corliss et al., 2002; Saewyc et al., 2006). Waldo et al. (1998) reported that instances of childhood abuse or victimization were positively correlated with self-reported gender atypicality. Stigmatizing Attitudes Stigmatizing attitudes such as negative attitudes toward LGBTQ individuals, HIV/AIDS stigma disproportionate toward LGBTQ individuals, and internalized homophobia are widespread, even throughout primary/middle schools up to postsecondary education, despite research indicating that with increases in age and education homophobia decreases (Lambert et al., 2006; Marsiglio, 1993; Poteat et al., 2009; Pettijohn & Walzer, 2008; Roberts et al., 2011; Sharpe, 2002). Research has demonstrated that stigma and negative attitudes toward LGBTQ people are relatively common, including some studies in schools where students endorsed beliefs 91   that homosexuality is always wrong or usually wrong (Sharpe, 2002), or where students indicated that they could never stay friends with someone who identified as gay or lesbian and would prefer to attend a school where there were no sexual minority students (Poteat et al., 2009). These kinds of negative attitudes toward sexual minority individuals can have a significant impact on sexual minority individuals. Rosario et al. (2002) found that anxious symptoms at a six-month follow-up were predicted when an individual experienced an event of perceived stigmatization such as losing a friend due to their sexual orientation. In an eight-year longitudinal study examining stigma and mental health among gay and bisexual men, Pachankis et al. (2018) found significant associations between three types of stigma (i.e., enacted, anticipated, and internalized) and social anxiety symptoms. Interestingly, over time these men experienced a significant increase in social anxiety, despite significant decreases in many forms of stigma (Pachankis et al., 2018). Fanucce and Taub (2010) explored the effect of homonegativity on the climate of campus residence halls. They found that homonegativity impacts all the students in the residence halls, LGBTQ and heterosexual alike, leading to reduced satisfaction with the residence hall climate. The impact of increasing levels of homonegativity was increased perception of the residence halls as more negative. When LGBTQ students perceive their residence halls as negative toward them, they can feel separate, left out of the community, like they do not belong, and that they are not socially supported (Fanucce & Taub, 2010). It would seem that these feelings and experiences could have a significant impact on LGB college students experience and level of support while in school. 92   Stigma has been wrongly placed on the LGBTQ community, particularly with the concern of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has disproportionately affected the LGBTQ community, as the general public was often misinformed about how the virus spread and often associated the illness with sexual minority individuals (Herek & Capitanio, 1999; Swendeman et al., 2006). This led to LGBTQ people experiencing more stigmatization and discrimination for HIV/AIDS, such as the finding by Swendeman et al. (2006) in which HIV positive sexual minority youth were twice as likely as HIV positive heterosexual youth to experience stigma related to their positive status including avoidance of physical contact, verbal abuse, or loss of a friend. Unfortunately, many of these attitudes and stigma can become internalized for LGBTQ individuals, leading them to have negative feelings about sexual minority orientation in general and for themselves, which is known as internalized homophobia (Kubicek et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2011; Rosario et al., 2008). Some research has begun to examine the relationship between internalized homophobia and anxiety; in one study with LGB adults internalized homophobia predicted anxiety symptoms (Igartua et al., 2003) and in another study with young gay and bisexual men the relationship between internalized homophobia and substance abuse was mediated by anxiety symptoms (Rosario et al., 2006). Feinstein et al. (2012) found a significant association between internalized homonegativity and rejection sensitivity, depression, and social anxiety. Bostwick et al. (2010) explored the idea that the prevalence of mental health concerns differs across the varying dimensions of sexual orientation and that the patterns of risk are different for men and women and specific groups within the sexual minority umbrella. They found that the impact of sexual orientation on health outcomes seems to function differently for 93   men and women, as a higher prevalence for mental health concerns was more consistently associated with any definition of sexual minority status for men (Bostwick et al., 2010). They surmised that a significant factor contributing to this difference is a more extreme stigma toward sexual minority men in the United States, and that with this stigma comes more severe sanctions for violating “traditional” sex norms, such as serious victimization like threats of harm and physical violence, which are associated with poor mental health outcomes (Bostwick et al., 2010). However, among women, the prevalence rates varied based on the definition of sexual minority status used, with exclusive same-sex attraction and behavior both being related to lower rates of most lifetime and past-year disorders (Bostwick et al., 2010). Alternatively, poorer health outcomes were found for individuals who identified as bisexual or were unsure about their identity (Bostwick et al., 2010). The authors found increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders for men and women who endorsed bisexual identity and behaviors (Bostwick et al., 2010). They related this to the unique “double” stigma faced by bisexual individuals, which is different from that experienced by lesbian and gay individuals, as stereotypes and negative attitudes are pervasive among heterosexual, lesbian, and gay populations (Bostwick et al., 2010). These finding indicate that there is important variation among health outcomes within the LGB community and that the individual experience and potential risk likely differ based in part on how someone’s sexual identity, attraction, and behaviors area viewed and treated by society. Self-concealment Many individuals who identify as LGB or a gender and sexual minority learn to conceal their identity at an early age as a coping strategy since there is generally a lack of acceptance and the potential for victimization (D’Augelli, 1992; Martin, 1982; Pachankis & Goldfried, 2006; Roesler & Deisher, 1972). Individuals who are members of minority groups are likely to 94   experience hypervigilance when they are involved in social situations and engaging with individuals who are a part of the dominant group (Goffman, 1963; Pachankis & Goldfried, 2006), which may lead to social settings becoming a source of distress for those with a “concealable stigma” (Pachankis & Goldfried, 2006, p. 998; Smart & Wegner, 1999) as they would likely be thinking about their hidden identity throughout this interaction and focusing on keeping it hidden. Jourard (1959) noted that the mere presence of another person might be anxiety-provoking if becoming acquainted with that person is seen as a possible threat or risk, highlighting that perceiving individuals as dangerous can thwart the one’s ability to form close relationships. This heightened awareness and need to self-monitor may be a prominent factor in these individuals’ experience of social anxiety, as the individual may become preoccupied with concealment (J. M. Cohen et al., 2016; Pachankis & Goldfried, 2006). Cohen et al. (2016) also proposed that a common factor of both social phobia and sexual orientation concealment may be behavioral inhibition, in which people who are socially anxious could be less likely to share personal information, including holding a sexual minority identity. In one study, self-concealment was significantly and positively associated with anxiety (Leleux-Labarge et al., 2015). However, Pachankis and Bernstein (2012) completed a study examining sexual orientation covering, self-consciousness, and anxiety. They found that the relationship between self-consciousness in public and daily experiences of anxiety was mediated by the individual’s engagement in daily sexual orientation covering (Pachankis & Bernstein, 2012). In another study examining anxiety and depression symptoms in sexual minority young adults (J. M. Cohen et al., 2016), researchers found that symptoms of social phobia were significantly predicted by concealment of sexual orientation and greater concealment was 95   significantly associated with greater symptom severity of social phobia. The authors indicated that this may suggest that concealment intensifies socially anxious symptoms. LGB individuals with decreased levels of social anxiety tended to experience increased levels of social support, whereas greater social anxiety was related to less social support, which was related to more self-concealment (Potoczniak et al., 2007). Self-concealment has a significant negative relationship with ego identity commitment, which may imply that LGB individuals may have difficulty committing to an identity if they feel they need to conceal information about themselves (Potoczniak et al., 2007). Some barriers to openness about sexual orientation include fears of job loss, losing friends, verbal abuse at school or home, and physical abuse or harm at school or home (D’Augelli & Hershberger, 1993). Sexual Orientation Victimization Compared to heterosexual peers, sexual minority individuals are at a greater risk of experiencing discrimination, violence, and rejection (Faulkner & Cranston, 1998; Garofalo et al., 1998), including verbal harassment, physical harassment, and discriminatory policies at school (Kosciw et al., 2014). Research has found that negative attitudes toward LGBTQ individuals are commonly heard, in academic settings especially, with nearly 60% of the youth in one study indicating that they had experienced verbal abuse in their high school, as well as other abuses such as objects being thrown, physical altercations and assault, and sexual assault (D’Augelli et al., 2002; Poteat & Espelage, 2007; Roberts et al., 2011; Russell, Franz & Driscoll, 2001). Garofalo et al. (1998) found that compared to heterosexual peers, LGB youth were more likely to miss school out of fear and to report being recently threatened with a weapon at school. Even broader than the school environment, Duncan and Hatzenbuehler (2014) found that community context matters too. In their study, there was a positive association between reports of suicidal 96   ideation and attempts among LGBTQ youth who lived in neighborhoods with more LGBTQ-related hate crimes compared to LGBTQ youth who lived in neighborhoods with fewer of these crimes (Duncan & Hatzenbuehler, 2014). It has also been demonstrated that suicide attempts were less likely among LGBTQ youth living in areas that generally support LGBTQ rights (Hatzenbuehler, 2011). Mays and Cochran (2001) found higher rates of daily and lifetime discrimination among gay men and lesbians compared to heterosexual peers and indicated that these experiences of discrimination were associated with more psychological distress. Toomey et al. (2011) found that psychological distress and overall well-being for young adults was related to past experiences of bias-based victimization, indicating that these experiences likely continue to impact individuals in later developmental stages. Feinstein et al. (2012) found a significant relationship between experiences of discrimination, internalized homonegativity, rejection sensitivity, depression, and social anxiety. Adding to this trajectory, Robinson et al. (2013) found that the bullying rates of gay and bisexual men reduce less throughout the adolescent years compared to the rates of heterosexual men, which could indicate longer periods of risk for LGBTQ youth (Russell & Fish, 2016). A challenge in understanding and mitigating the negative effects of bias-based victimization is that compared to general harassment it has a distinct and amplifying effect on negative outcomes (Poteat & Russell, 2013; Russell & Fish, 2016). For example, higher levels of depression, substance use, missing school, suicidal ideation, and attempts have been reported among youth who have experienced sexual-orientation-based victimization compared to youth who experienced non-bias-based victimization (Poteat et al., 2011; Russell, Sinclair, et al., 2012). Additionally, these effects have not only been seen among LGBTQ youth, but also among heterosexual youth with research showing that homophobic victimization has led to poor mental 97   health among these individuals (Poteat et al., 2011; Robinson & Espelage, 2012). Research has begun to investigate the specific effects of sexual orientation victimization, including the relationship between discrimination and anxiety. In one study, Herek et al. (1999) found that higher levels of anxiety were reported by gay men who experienced a hate crime in the last five years compared to gay men that had not experienced crime related to their identity or not experienced crime at all. Research has found that sexual orientation victimization continues to be common in postsecondary education, with studies at colleges and universities finding that within the past year approximately one-third of undergraduate students reported offensive comments, harassment, threats, and assaults, and to avoid harassment a majority of students indicated that they hide their gender or sexual minority identity (D’Augelli et al., 2002; Ellis, 2009; Evans, 2001; Evans & D’Augelli, 1996; Love, 1998; Waldo et al., 1998). Students reported that these instances happened in many areas on campus, including public spaces, classrooms, and on-campus residences primarily at the hands of other students (D’Augelli et al., 2002; Ellis, 2009). D’Augelli et al. (2002) reported that experiences of sexual orientation victimization are associated with increased distress among youth who hold sexual minority identities. Waldo et al. (1998) found that instances of sexual orientation victimization occur and have similar correlates for LGB individuals in urban and rural communities. Mustanski et al. (2011) found that victimization showed a strong relationship with psychological distress among LGB individuals. Overall, in their sample of LGB youth they found high rates of victimization, with 94% of participants reporting some type of victimization, from verbal insults to physical violence, that they believed was related to their sexual orientation. However, they found only one-third of these participants reported clinical levels of psychological 98   distress, suggesting that some of the participants had resources in their lives that added to their resilience against negative experiences. In their study, they found that levels of victimization varied by race/ethnicity, with the highest levels being reported by Black participants, then those identified as “other,” White, and Latino. The highest levels of psychological distress were reported by White and “Other” identified participants. In the model they tested, they found that peer and family support demonstrated significant compensatory effects, but ultimately the negative effects of victimization remained significant and had negative consequences on those youth, even with social support present. The authors suggested that in addition to providing social support, programs and efforts to directly address victimization should be implemented. One example they provided was the safe school coalitions (Perrotti & Westheimer, 2001). Research has demonstrated that there is a link between social anxiety and rejection from the majority group (Feinstein et al., 2012; Hart & Heimberg, 2005; Meyer, 2003; Szymanski et al., 2008), with higher levels of social anxiety being connected to increased expectations of rejection and frequent experiences of discrimination (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Pachankis et al., 2008), which highlights the importance of understanding how these factors impact LGB individuals and their experience of social anxiety throughout their development. In further exploring mechanisms through which discrimination can lead to increased psychopathology, Burns et al. (2012) examined the relationship between attributions of discriminatory events and social anxiety in gay men. They found that experiences of perceived discrimination were associated with increased social anxiety, but only when high levels of global attributions and importance were endorsed, indicating that attributional styles could be a risk or protective factor regarding discrimination. 99   Additionally, LGBTQ youth experience greater psychological and social problems related to being LGBTQ such as alcohol and drug use, engagement in risky sexual behaviors, decreased social support, and suicidality (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Hart & Heimberg, 2005; Marshal et al., 2008; Safren & Pantalone, 2006). Grant et al. (2014) found that LGBQ students were more likely than their heterosexual peers to be overweight, depressed, have higher levels of stress, and have higher rates of compulsive sexual behavior and compulsive buying. They suggested that the increased levels of these factors could reflect coping utilized by these students as a reaction to stress, depression, or social isolation that may occur in school environments that prevent them from fully engaging in the college experience due to a culture that fosters sexual minority stigma on campus. Another interpretation Grant et al. (2014) offered was that these observations may be the result of maladaptive coping behaviors formed prior to college due to shame and internalized homonegativity, which are leading to increased stress, depression, and anxiety. Both of these ideas align with the notion that some LGB youth may struggle to cope with these experiences of minority stress due to lack of skills or resources and may develop maladaptive strategies to cope (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008; Meyer, 2003), such as rumination and suppression of emotions (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009). Impact of Social Anxiety on College Students SAD is important to study within the college population because it impacts students’ social and emotional adjustment to college (Nordstrom et al., 2014). In particular, college students are in a peculiar position between the ages of typical onset and emerging symptoms becoming stabilized and solidified from adolescence to young adulthood (Nordstrom et al., 2014). College academic, social, personal, and emotional adjustment can be predicted by most students’ level of satisfaction with their social support, including positive relationships with 100   professors, but because social anxiety can have an impact on perceived or actual social support, students who experience social anxiety may not be able to build and engage in such social supports during the challenging transition into college (Kuder & Grover, 2014; Nordstrom et al., 2014). In a study where college students were asked to have a conversation with a friend (Kuder & Grover, 2014), socially anxious students often held negative perceptions of their own social competencies and were observed to have performance deficits in interpersonal skills, appear less comfortable, demonstrate verbosity or brevity in speaking, and were less effective at maintaining the conversational flow. Kuder and Grover (2014) noted that this could interfere with socially anxious students’ ability to create intimate and supportive relationships as it could impede effective communication with friends and limit those relationships, in turn potentially limiting overall social support in college. Social anxiety can be related to higher levels of homesickness, lower levels of social support, and academic problems such as lower grades, more absences from class, fear of public speaking, lower self-esteem, and lower GPA (di Maria & di Nuovo, 1990; Strahan, 2003; Urani et al., 2003). Nordstrom et al. (2014) found that compared to students with low social anxiety, those with high levels of social anxiety demonstrated significantly lower global, academic, and social self-esteem; greater mental health symptoms such as somatization, obsessive-compulsive processes, and anxious, depressive, and phobic symptoms; and more difficulty in all domains related to college adjustment. In particular, the researchers noted that higher levels of social anxiety among incoming first-year students was comorbid with continued depressive, anxious, and physical symptoms during the first semester. One finding of Nordstrom et al. (2014) was a significant increase in social self-esteem across the first semester for students high in school anxiety, which they suggested could indicate that as these students are repeatedly exposed to and 101   must navigate the social situations and challenges that arise in college, they may gain an increased sense of mastery leading to decreases in anxiety. However, overall, they suggested that students’ academic, social, and institutional adjustment is compromised by the impact of social anxiety reducing multiple aspects of self-esteem (Nordstrom et al., 2014). An indirect impact that social anxiety can have on an individual could be reduced support and closeness from peers due to the stigma associated with SAD. In a study examining the stigma of SAD through describing stereotypes of social anxiety and comparing them to stereotypes of depression or generic mental illness, Anderson et al. (2015) found similarities between the stigmatization of a person with general mental illness and a person with social anxiety. Specifically, they found that more social distance was desired if the person/social anxiety was perceived as dangerous, having an embarrassing problem, being more avoidable, being more common among women, or causing problems at work, but less desire for social distance was associated if social anxiety was perceived as unavoidable (Anderson et al., 2015). Another study by Purdon et al. (2001) found that in social situations most participants occasionally experienced symptoms of anxiety and in their study all symptoms of anxiety were experienced by some participants at some point in time. The majority of their participants indicated that their perception of an individual's intelligence, ambition, reliability, or mental health would not be influenced by noticing that the person was anxious. However, participants did indicate that they thought less of an anxious appearing person’s leadership abilities and strength of character. Interestingly, while individuals higher in social anxiety believed those who are anxious would have higher compassion, it seems they may have been somewhat less compassionate in their judgments about others who were anxious as they were likely to view anxious others as less attractive and as having less strength of character. This could be a 102   contributing factor to interpersonal challenges of connecting with others and building social support. It could also be a factor that would make experiencing sensations of anxiety particularly threatening or impactful for socially anxious individuals in front of others, as they may anticipate the same judgment (Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011). The authors suggested that correcting the potentially exaggerated beliefs held by people with social phobia regarding the social consequences of exhibiting anxiety in front of other people may be a course of action for treatment. Socially anxious students may experience more cognitive and affective difficulties, as well as more general cognitive distortions (Kashdan & Roberts, 2004; Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011). In a study by Davison and Zighelboim (1987) socially anxious students provided more irrational thoughts than control (non-anxious) students. Johnson et al. (1992) found that socially anxious students endorsed more distressed responses, more distorted responses, and elevated levels of depressed thinking about other areas of life than students who were less socially anxious. Johnson et al. (1992) indicated that social isolation and depressogenic cognitions can lead to an increased risk for depression among socially anxious students and concluded that social anxiety could be a risk factor for development of depression in these students. Social anxiety has a significant impact on college students as it can affect their ability to adjust and function as they transition into young adulthood. As explored above, it has been demonstrated that social anxiety impacts students’ social and emotional adjustment to college, their ability to build and engage in such social supports, and can lead to deficits in interpersonal and communication skills that can impede ability to make and maintain relationships (Kuder & Grover, 2014; Nordstrom et al., 2014). College students with social anxiety may have higher levels of home sickness, lower esteem, lower social support, lower grades and GPA, be absent 103   more frequently, have fear of public speaking, experience greater mental health issues, and display cognitive difficulties (Davison & Zighelboim, 1987; di Maria & di Nuovo, 1990; Johnson et al., 1992; Kashdan & Roberts, 2004; Nordstrom et al., 2014; Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011; Strahan, 2003; Urani et al., 2003). Impact of Social Anxiety on LGB Rapee and Heimberg (1997) proposed a model to explore how social anxiety may have a considerable impact on LGB individuals. Their model suggests that a negative feedback loop is responsible for perpetuating and exacerbating social anxiety. In this negative feedback loop, an individual anticipates that a social encounter will go badly, then they experience anxiety and negative thoughts during the encounter, which leads them to negatively interpret and judge their performance in the situation. This continues across social situations, which in turn provides evidence to the individual that they should fear or avoid social situations all together (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997). If this model is used to understand the process and experience of social anxiety among a group of individuals who experiences social oppression, one might consider that experiences of oppression could add evidence to an individual’s negative interpretation. Additional evidence to support a negative interpretation may increase an individual’s anxiety and further reinforce the negative feedback loop, therefore leading to an increase in their symptoms of social anxiety (Rapee & Heimberg, 1997; Wadsworth & Hayes-Skelton, 2015). It also is suggested that sexual minority individuals might experience more negative thoughts about social situations than heterosexual individuals, as they are more likely to experience a great deal of stigma-related thoughts during these interactions (Smart & Wegner, 1999). Experience of social support is likely a significant factor in the experience of social anxiety, where less social support is correlated with higher experience of social anxiety, as well 104   as development of a healthy ego identity. This may emphasize the importance of a supporting and accepting environment for LGB individuals (Potoczniak et al., 2007), as apparent social anxiety and related symptoms can potentially be related to an individual’s identity. This may impact many areas of their life versus a generalized social anxiety that could persist (or exist) outside of identity development, though an individual’s identity should also not be assumed to be related to their problems and difficulties (Walsh & Hope, 2010). Safren and Pantalone (2006) found that compared to heterosexual youth, LGB youth reported more social anxiety, with higher social anxiety being associated with less satisfaction with social support. However, regardless of social anxiety, they found a trend of less satisfaction with social support among LGB youth compared to heterosexual youth overall. Additionally, fewer positive events were experienced among those LGB youth with higher social anxiety. These results suggest that social anxiety may have an impact on LGB youths’ social development, though it appears to be in conjunction with other unique developmental factors that these youth face during adolescence, such as exploration of their sexual orientation and learning to cope with challenges of this developmental time period. Safren and Pantalone (2006) hypothesized that social anxiety could be a barrier for LGB youth from receiving social support and participating in positive events, as it could create challenges for them in seeking out and maintaining relationships, even when like peers are around and available. They suggested that LGB youth may have fewer opportunities to engage in positive experiences with peers, which would allow them to build competence in social relationships, form satisfying supportive relationships, and create community, if they are fearful and avoidant of these very necessary social interactions due to social anxiety and perceiving that they may be different from peers in a way that may be rejected by others. This negative impact of social anxiety on LGBTQ individuals’ social supports could lead to difficulties with self-105   acceptance and self-concealment (Potoczniak et al., 2007; Roberts et al., 2011). Safren and Pantalone (2006) also discussed the social pressures that LGB youth may experience related to development, particularly around socialization and dating, which could create a pressure to conceal their sexual minority identity and conform to heterosexual behaviors. LGB individuals may also experience sexual risk behaviors related to social anxiety. Hart and Heimberg (2005) examined the relationship between unprotected sex and observation anxiety and social interaction anxiety among young sexual minority men. They found that social anxiety predicted an increased likelihood of engagement in unprotected sex in the past six months. Social anxiety can have many potential consequences for college students in addition to impaired social and occupational functioning (Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011). Substance use, depression, and suicidality are areas that research has indicated more risk for LGBTQ youth but has not specifically been directly tied to social anxiety empirically, though researchers have suggested possible relationships with these factors. There is the potential risk of increased alcohol and drug use for socially anxious LGB youth as there is already a relationship of high comorbidity between SAD and substance use in the general population (Buckner et al., 2008; Schneier et al., 2010), as well as higher prevalence of alcohol and substance use among LGBTQ youth in general compared to heterosexual youth (Marshal et al., 2008; Noell & Ochs, 2001; Rosario et al., 1997; Rotheram-Borus et al., 1994). Increased substance use may be related to marginalization, depression, loneliness, interpersonal stress, stigmatization, victimization, discrimination, homophobia, and shame (Bontempo & D’Augelli, 2002; Cochran & Mays, 2000; Herbert et al., 1994; Hughes & Eliason, 2002; Jordan, 2000; Mays & Cochran, 2001; McDermott et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2011; Rosario et al., 106   1997). Individuals who are socially anxious appear to fear others noticing their anxiety and the potential social consequences of such (Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011). Lewis and Vogeltanz-Holm (2002) suggested that, in accordance with the tension reduction hypothesis, people frequently abuse or consume alcohol with the expectation that doing so will lessen uncomfortable feelings and thoughts, acting as a form of self-medication for those anxious feelings. These “ineffective coping strategies such as drinking and social isolation may be especially problematic in the college setting” (Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011, p. 2), as previous research has shown individuals who are socially anxious are more likely than those who are not anxious to report problems related to alcohol (Kessler et al., 1997; Kushner et al., 1990) as SAD is often a prominent motivation for heavy drinking among college students (Burke & Stephens, 1999). There is a higher risk of depression and suicidality among LGBTQ youth compared to their heterosexual counterparts, including higher frequency of reports of past suicide attempts (Almeida et al., 2009; D’Augelli, 2002; Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Garofalo et al., 1998; Hershberger & D’Augelli, 1995; Remafedi et al., 1998; Remafedi, 2002; Safren & Heimberg, 1999). While the relationship between depression and suicidality with social anxiety has not been thoroughly examined in the literature regarding risk factors for LGBTQ youth, it is likely an important variable to consider as it potentially connects with other related factors. For example, in two studies examining past suicide attempts by sexual and minority youth, Hershberger et al. (1997) found that predictors of past suicide attempts included disclosing one’s identity, losing friends due to disclosing, and victimization. Remafedi (1999) found variables associated with past attempts to include gender nonconformity, violence, lack of support, dropping out of school, 107   and family problems. Additionally, Bränström et al. (2020) found that barriers to social integration may contribute to higher risk of suicidality among LGB individuals. Based on the reviewed research, there are many significant contributing factors to the risk and impact of social anxiety among LGB college students. This research includes mixed results at times, with some studies demonstrating contradicting findings that could be due to many factors whether related to unique characteristics of the sample or variations in age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, or time period of the study. However, based on the research, potential risk factors for SAD for LGB college students may be general etiological factors for SAD that are common to all, such as genetic vulnerabilities, neurobiological vulnerabilities, inhibited temperament, poor attachment, negative parenting styles, negative life events (e.g., childhood stressors like abuse, illness, or family conflict) direct or indirect exposure to conditioning experiences such as socially traumatic events, social skills deficits, or cognitive biases (Higa-McMillan & Ebesutani, 2011). Risk factors for SAD for LGB students may also include social factors such as peer victimization (Craig, 1998; Walters & Inderbitzen, 1998) or sexual-minority-related factors including minority stress (Dürrbaum & Sattler, 2020; Eaton, 2014; Feinstein et al., 2012; Kuyper & Fokkema, 2011; Newcomb & Mustanski, 2010; Pachankis et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2010; Sattler et al., 2017; Szymanski & Sung, 2010), lack of support socially and culturally from significant societal institutions (Russell & Fish, 2016), developmental issues, gender role nonconformity, abusive and negative family experiences, self-concealment, and sexual orientation victimization (SOV; Bailey & Zucker, 1995; Corliss et al., 2002; Garofalo et al., 1998; Poteat et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2011). The impact of social anxiety on LGB college students may include difficulty building social support networks that assist with the transition to college (Kuder & Grover, 2014; 108   Nordstrom et al., 2014), reduced social support and closeness (Anderson et al., 2015; Purdon et al., 2001; Safren & Pantalone, 2006; Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011), higher levels of homesickness, academic problems such as lower grades, more absences from class, fear of public speaking, lower self-esteem, lower GPA (di Maria & di Nuovo, 1990; Nordstrom et al., 2014; Strahan, 2003; Urani et al., 2003), greater mental health symptoms such as somatization, obsessive-compulsive processes, and anxious, depressive, and phobic symptoms (Nordstrom et al., 2014), cognitive and affective difficulties (Kashdan & Roberts, 2004; Sailer & Hazlett-Stevens, 2011), sexual risk behavior (Hart & Heimberg, 2005), substance abuse (Buckner et al., 2008; Marshal et al., 2008; Noell & Ochs, 2001; Rosario et al., 1997; Rotheram-Borus et al., 1994; Schneier et al., 2010), and depression and suicidality (Almeida et al., 2009; D’Augelli, 2002; Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Garofalo et al., 1998; Hershberger & D’Augelli, 1995; Remafedi et al., 1998; Remafedi, 2002; Safren & Heimberg, 1999). This vast body of research is still limited in many ways when attempting to understand the causes, correlations, and impact of social anxiety among LGB individuals, college students, and LGB college students, specifically due to the extensive variety of factors that could be playing a role in these individuals’ experiences of social anxiety. The experience of LGB college students is a complex picture that requires consideration of intersectional factors when examining development, risk, and impact of mental health. An additional consideration when exploring the socially anxious experiences of LGB youth is that ultimately when contemplating some of these potential risks, it could be unclear whether an individual’s minority status comes with some of these risks leading to social anxiety, or if social anxiety could lead to some of these negative outcomes, or both. In reviewing this research, there is little information about the directional relationship or causes of social anxiety as it relates to LGB college students. Also, it 109   is important to consider the clinical implications, utility, and appropriateness of even diagnosing social anxiety if it were to be caused by minority status, since identity would be the mediating factor and the social context for having that anxiety would make sense. This is particularly true in relation to the need for hypervigilance, concern of protecting oneself, and being safe in the world as an individual who holds a minority identity that carries risk in and of itself. In this context, there is the chance that the anxiety could be appropriate at times and not considered to be “excessive” or “abnormal.”   110   Chapter IV: PROTECTIVE FACTORS AND PREVENTION FOR SAD In considering the expected high prevalence of SAD among LGB college students and the myriad of factors that could potentiate risk related to social anxiety, their transition to college, and their overall development and success, it is important to then explore the possible protective factors that can improve their outcomes and prevent a poor prognosis. This leads to the final question of this project, which is exploring which factors facilitate resilience and prevent or protect LGB college students from developing or further progressing social anxiety, as well as investigating effective approaches to treatment. The hypothesis is that the preventative or protective factors of social anxiety for LGB college students are an intersection of factors that are preventative or protective for LGB individuals and college students overall, such as perceived social support, increased supports on college campuses, accessible resources targeted to this specific population, integrated programming in the orientation process, and reduced stigma surrounding LGB community and mental health overall. However, due to lack of literature on preventative factors for college students broadly or specifically in relation to social anxiety, this project was unable to examine and review those factors in consideration of the intersection of the college student population and the LGB population. Therefore, factors related to the LGB population were primarily explored in this section. Not all members of the LGB community develop social anxiety or experience social anxiety in college. Therefore, it is important to identify the protective factors that increase resilience and buffer them from the development and effects of SAD. In considering factors that can facilitate or promote resilience, it is important to define resilience. One definition of resilience is a “process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity” (Luthar et al., 2000, p. 543). Within resilience, there are risk factors and promotive 111   factors; the latter being resources that assist individuals in avoiding negative outcomes or consequences (Fergus & Zimmerman, 2004; Garmezy et al., 1984; Luthar et al., 2000; Rutter, 1985). Promotive factors work through compensatory processes, in which the factor directly impacts a result independently of risk factor effects, and/or protective processes, whereby the factor reduces the impact of a risk factor on a negative outcome or consequence (Fergus & Zimmerman, 2004; Garmezy et al., 1984; Luthar et al., 2000; Rutter, 1985). Resilience has also been defined as “a process resulting from the interplay of personal and contextual factors which allow LGB individuals to engage in positive adaptation to adversity, especially due to homophobic discrimination” (de Lira & de Morais, 2018, p. 278; Meyer, 2003, 2010). Based on this idea, de Lira and de Morais (2018) indicated that some researchers suggested resilience should be assessed through the interaction of risk and protective factors, with positive adaptation being the outcome of this interaction. Individual, family, and community-based resilience have been identified as the three main concepts of resilience (de Lira & de Morais, 2018). This chapter explores internal protective factors for LGB individuals such as social support, emotional openness, hope, optimism, health-promoting habits, psychological hardiness, outness, and religious faith. It discusses external protective factors for LGB individuals such as family support, social support, and broader community support. Then, it reviews ideas for intervention and prevention of SAD with LGB college students. Internal Factors A literature review was completed by De Lira and de Morais (2018), and they explored general resilience among the sexual minority population and examined internal factors that contributed to an individual’s resilience. They found these factors to include social support, 112   emotional openness, hope, optimism, health-promoting habits, psychological hardiness, outness, and religious faith. Kwon (2013) proposed a model of LGB resilience and explored resilience factors within the framework of that model. Working from a general model and concepts of resilience and acknowledging the impact of social relationships on health and well-being through connectedness and buffering of stress, they proposed that social support, emotional openness, hope, and optimism (in relation to a future orientation) were key factors to psychological health. While social support demonstrates a direct relationship to psychological well-being, it also helps through a mechanism of stress buffering. In addition to social support, emotional openness, hope, and optimism also work to reduce an individual’s reactivity to prejudice through stress buffering, which in turn impacts the individual’s psychological health and well-being (Kwon, 2013). Through conducting qualitative interviews with young gay and bisexual men who were diagnosed with HIV, Harper et al. (2014) derived primary themes regarding resilience processes for young gay and bisexual men. They found that resilience was demonstrated across the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels, in relation to cognitions, behaviors, seeking support from others, and providing support to others. The primary areas related to resilience included utilizing cognitive processes that promote health, engaging in behavioral habits or practices that are healthy, connecting with others to obtain social support, and providing support to and empowering other young gay or bisexual men (Harper et al., 2014). Figueroa and Zoccola (2015) explored the role of psychological hardiness in the association between stigma consciousness, which is related to poor mental and physical health outcomes and self-reported health. Psychological hardiness is defined as “a personality composite consisting of control (having a sense of control over life events), commitment (being 113   engaged and having a genuine interest in life), and challenge (seeing stressors as opportunities for growth)” (Figueroa & Zoccola, 2015, p. 330). They hypothesized that among sexual minority individuals, hardiness would buffer the relationship between stigma consciousness and self-reported health, based on past research demonstrating a buffering effect of hardiness and associations between hardiness and self-reports of better mental and physical health. They found a strong negative correlation between psychological hardiness and all physical and mental health variables, as well as a negative correlation with stigma consciousness. The results of this study suggested that sexual minority individuals with higher psychological hardiness had better mental and physical health. Additionally, they found a buffering effect on psychological hardiness on the relationship between stigma consciousness and discomfort from physical symptoms, indicating that higher psychological hardiness was associated with fewer physical symptoms. Despite the risks associated with coming out for sexual minority youth, research with LGB adults demonstrated that those who disclose their identities reported positive psychosocial adjustment and more support from family (D’Augelli, 2002; Luhtanen, 2002; Morris et al., 2001), as well as reduced depression and improved well-being in young adulthood for individuals who were out in high school (Russell et al., 2014). Additionally, students who reported concealing their sexual minority identity at school more still experienced victimization and concealment in school and had a negative association with adjustment in young adulthood (Russell et al., 2014), indicating that despite the risk, there are positive benefits related to LGB youth coming out in high school (Russell & Fish, 2016). Kosciw et al. (2015) investigated resiliency among LGBTQ students, particularly the role of openness about sexual orientation and the relationship between openness and student well-being. Coming out is often an important developmental milestone for LGB individuals, though it 114   is associated with both positive effects on psychological well-being and an increased risk of victimization, which can negatively impact psychological well-being. The authors examined not only the relationship between being out and well-being in relation to risk and resilience but also the impact of the community context of being in rural or suburban areas. They found that being out was related to higher levels of victimization while also being related to higher self-esteem and decreased depression. Additionally, they noted more victimization for out individuals in rural areas compared to suburban areas, as well as reduced well-being and academic success. However, this did not result in rural youth being less likely to disclose their sexual orientation. Ultimately, it appears that the positive effects on well-being related to outness often significantly reduce the negative effects of victimization and may be associated with improved well-being throughout life in general. However, it is always important to note the context of the individual and complete an analysis of the risks and rewards of being out versus assuming that being out is best for everyone (Kosciw et al., 2015). Walker and Longmire-Avital (2013) explored the relationship between religiosity, internalized homonegativity, and resiliency among young adult Black LGB individuals. They discussed how historically, religion has been used as a common tool for coping among the Black community and how Black LGB individuals may seek out religious support, as religion has been a path to resilience through navigating oppression. They found that for some Black LGB people, a lack of religious belief can substantially impact their ability to cope when experiencing considerable internalized homonegativity. Their findings suggest that religious faith can act as a resource and support for young Black LGB adults exploring their identity, as some religious institutions are successfully inclusive. However, there is also concern for individuals who seek support from institutions that are not tolerant of sexual minorities due to the potential impact on 115   those individuals if they experience conflict or rejection from their community. Ultimately, Walker and Longmire-Avital (2013) suggested that these two pieces of one’s identity, sexuality and religious faith, are not inherently mutually exclusive, and it is important for clinicians to acknowledge that the relationship between homonegativity and religious faith is a complex one, but the impact it may have on resiliency can be very important to explore. While this study specifically discussed the role of religiosity and homonegativity for Black LGB young adults, it is likely that this complex relationship with religion extends to other LGB young adults with varying racial or ethnic backgrounds and would be just as important to explore with those clients too. In a study examining sexual identity development and adjustment, Rosario et al. (2011) found that among LGB youth, consistently high identity integration or previously high integration was associated with better psychological adjustment. Specifically, they found that LGB youth with high identity integration reported significantly less anxiety, depression, and conduct problems, and higher self-esteem than youth with low integration. Youth with high identity integration also reported the highest self-esteem compared to middle or low integrated youth. Youth who were consistently high in integration or who were high and decreased to middle integration reported lower psychological distress than other youth. Additionally, supportive relationships were associated with better psychological adjustment, such that youth who had higher levels of family and friend support reported less depression, with friend support also associated with fewer conduct problems and family support also associated with higher self-esteem. Higher levels of support from family and friends were associated with a higher likelihood to be consistently high in integration or to move from high to middle integration. Overall, the researchers’ findings demonstrated the benefits of identity integration. The authors 116   suggested that LGB youth low in identity integration would benefit from being identified and supported through targeted interventions. This research highlighted the importance of addressing issues related to identity integration and how addressing challenges to identity integration may facilitate change that can lead to improved psychological adjustment. External Factors There has been some investigation into external protective factors in relation to individual resilience; these factors include family support, social support, and broader community support. Most research has examined the role of family and social support in relation to building resilience, particularly regarding the LGB community. Research has shown that support from parents and peers is positively related to LGBTQ youth well-being, self-acceptance, and mental health, especially sexual-orientation- and gender-identity-related support, which can buffer negative effects of minority stress (D’Augelli, 2003; Doty et al., 2010; Rosario et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2010; Sheets & Mohr, 2009; Shilo & Savaya, 2011; Snapp et al., 2015; Ueno, 2005). Family Support Research has been conducted to examine the impact of family support on the well-being of LGB youth from both the perspectives of when LGB individuals have support from their families and when they lack support from their families. While lack of family support, and even more so rejection or victimization, can certainly pose a risk to health of LGB individuals, it is less clear the role family support plays as a protective factor or the degree to which it might buffer the effects of minority stress. Eisenberg and Resnick (2006) examined family connectedness as a protective factor for suicidal ideation and attempts among LGB youth. They found that family connectedness was significantly lower among LGB youth than heterosexual peers, but it was significantly protective 117   against suicidal ideation and attempts. In this study, the odds of suicidal ideation among youth in high family connectedness were about half that compared to youth with lower reported family connectedness. Additionally, in all of the models they tested, a greater amount of variance in suicidal behaviors was accounted for by family connectedness compared to other protective factors examined or sexual orientation. In a study examining the relationship between sexual orientation, victimization, and the effect these have on adolescent social-emotional health, Konishi and Saewyc (2014) found that the likelihood of experiencing social, emotional, or educational difficulties was significantly reduced for sexual minority students who had and had not experienced victimization through having the support of a caring parent (or even teacher) in their life. Ryan et al. (2010) examined the potential positive outcomes and protective factors of familial acceptance on the health of LGBTQ young adults. They found that family acceptance of LGBTQ youths’ identity is associated with positive mental health and physical health in young adulthood. Specifically, the findings indicated that support and acceptance of an LGBTQ individual’s sexual orientation and gender expression from their family is associated with higher self-esteem, social support, and general health. They also found protective effects of family support and acceptance including reduced experiences of depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation or attempts (Ryan et al., 2010). Relatedly, Reisner et al. (2014) completed a study exploring a compensatory model of risk and resiliency and the relationship to self-injury and suicide attempts among sexual minority youth, in which they found that decreased odds of self-injury and suicidality were independently associated with family support. These findings indicate that family support and acceptance is a significant protective factor for self-injury and suicidality (Reisner et al., 2014). In addition to support, parental reactions also have an impact on 118   LGB youth. According to a study by D’Augelli et al. (2008), youth who reported more positive reactions from their parents when they disclosed their identity revealed that they worried less about rejection, which may lead to reduced stress and anxiety for those individuals, especially around disclosing to others. Social Support A feeling of being different from others has been noted in LGB research, with a significant developmental task for LGB youth being to resolve these feelings, indicating that social support may be especially important for LGB individuals (Mustanski et al., 2011). There is a great deal of research demonstrating that supportive relationships can buffer the negative effects of stressful life events (Cohen & Wills, 1985), which can make supportive relationships a good factor to consider when exploring resilience (Mustanski et al., 2011). In a study testing two models of resilience, Mustanski et al. (2011) compared a compensatory model and a protective model, to explore factors that promoted healthy development among LGB youth in context of exposure to victimization. They found that peer support had the strongest correlation with psychological distress and had an independent promotive effect that did not vary significantly across age. Peer support included factors such as “lack of social loneliness, peer acceptance of homosexuality, and a sense of having friends as a resource” (Mustanski et al., 2011, p. 8) consistent with the idea that peer relationships play a critical role in adolescent development. For LGB youth, peer social support has been demonstrated to be protective of mental health, as social support was found to moderate the relationships between negative family attitudes and anxiety as well as family victimization and depression among LGB youth who lacked family support (Parra et al., 2018). More broadly, Parra et al. (2018) suggested that these 119   findings support the idea that peer social support can protect LGB young adults and buffer the adverse effects of negative attitudes, rejection, and victimization. For example, D’Augelli (2003) found that compared to LGB youth who lost friends due to coming out, LGB youth who kept their friends after coming out reported fewer symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts and reported higher self-esteem. Carastathis et al. (2017) examined the development of resilience in relation to overcoming family rejection after sexual minority individuals shared their sexual orientation. In this study, individuals reported the use of social support, connecting with other sexual minority individuals, acceptance of themselves and others, and use of strategic concealment as factors that fostered resilience, a strong sense of self, and healthy well-being. The use of social supports, including friends, teachers, colleagues, and others within their support networks, provided these individuals with support and acceptance of their sexuality, which appeared to buffer rejection from family through challenging negative attitudes toward sexual minorities and demonstrating that they would be accepted, they belonged, and they were normal. These feelings of acceptance, normalization and belonging were also found through connecting with other sexual minority individuals. For some participants, connection with other sexual minority people was the first time they felt that they belonged, and they had a space to explore the many aspects of their identity. Connecting with other sexual minority individuals helped these individuals work toward their own self-acceptance and demonstrated that they could have a successful future as a sexual-minority-identified person. Through experiencing acceptance and support from others, as well as through therapy, individuals were able to foster self-acceptance and challenge negative self-concepts, which increased their ability to cope with rejection or negativity from others and accept others’ non-acceptance as the other person’s issue. Participants also reported strategically 120   engaging in concealment strategies such as self-monitoring and image management around family members rejecting their identity, especially just after they came out, to avoid further negative consequences. Shilo and Savaya (2011) examined the effects of social supports on mental health and the meeting of sexual orientation milestones among LGB youth. They found that acceptance of one’s own sexual orientation was significantly positively associated with family acceptance and support, and disclosure of one’s sexual orientation was significantly positively associated with support and acceptance from friends. Additionally, family and friend support had strong, positive associations with LGB youth’s well-being, whereas family and friend support had strong, negative associations with the individual’s mental health and mental distress, respectively. These findings emphasize the importance of family and friend support on LGB youth’s mental health and well-being, as well as the impact it may have on their process of identity formation, while also noting the different roles of important relationships and the impact that the source of support may have. Mustanski et al. (2011) found that family support was significantly negatively associated to psychological distress, but the effects are not as strong as the effect of peer support. In their study, peer support included the absence of social isolation, peer acceptance of sexual orientation among peers, and a sense of friendship (Mustanski et al., 2011). Regarding family support, they found that the effects reduced with age and younger individuals benefited significantly more from it than older individuals. Comparatively, there was no significant interaction between peer support and age. These results lead to the suggestion of using peer-support-focused interventions with older LGB youth and family support focused interventions with younger LGB youth. While they found that support from family and peers did relate to reduced psychological distress, they 121   did not find a significant interaction with either family or peer support and victimization, indicating that victimization still had significant negative effects and consequences on the individuals and these effects were not significantly reduced by family or peer support. Mustanski et al. (2011) concluded that more than social support is needed to improve the well-being of LGB individuals and while important, it is only part of the answer. While they recommend treatment still explores ways to increase social support, they also recommend direct community efforts to reduce victimization. An example of this kind of direct effort is programs such as safe school coalitions (Perrotti & Westheimer, 2001), which work to reduce LGB bullying and violence by putting mechanisms in place in schools. As a strategy to improve LGB youth mental health, mental health professionals can play a crucial role in advocating and supporting the implementation of such programs in their community. In relation to family and peer support, the concept of autonomy support, which relates to the support one receives in authentically expressing and being themselves in their relationships, plays a role in how safe an individual perceives a relationship or social context to be (Ryan et al., 2017). In a study examining the relationship between perceived autonomy support and outness and well-being, Ryan et al. (2017) found that LGB individuals were most out with, felt the most autonomy support with, and most well-being with friends versus family, peers, or coworkers. They also found that more outness was associated with more autonomy support and self-esteem and lower anxiety and depression. As individuals perceive more autonomy support, self-esteem increases and experiences of anxiety and depression decrease. These associations were even stronger for individuals who reported high levels of internalized homophobia, as high autonomy support reduced the differences in depression, anxiety, and self-esteem between those with high and low levels of internalized homophobia. 122   While the impact of social media on mental health presents many mixed results, Pellicane et al. (2021) found that social media use can have beneficial effects on individuals; in particular, when LGB individuals have affirming experiences of acceptance online it is related to reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression in the future. This would seem to contribute to the idea that peer support has a meaningful impact on LGB youth, even when that support is virtual and not nearby. Potoczniak et al. (2007) completed a study examining the role of social support and self-concealment in the relationship between social anxiety and ego identity development. They found that the relationship between social anxiety and ego identity was mediated by social support, suggesting that sexual minority individuals who are less socially anxious tend to have more social support, which promotes better ego identity development. They also found that social support mediated the relationship between social anxiety and self-concealment, indicating that higher levels of social anxiety were associated with less social support and more self-concealment. The authors suggested that these findings highlighted the significant role that social support plays in the lives of LGB individuals, as it can lead to decreases in self-concealment and contribute to ego identity development, emphasizing the importance of supportive social environments and accepting of LGB individuals. They also noted that perceived social support was more impactful for women in the study. Adjacently, Cox et al. (2010) found that in relation to acculturation strategies utilized by sexual minority individuals, internalized homonegativity is significantly lower among those youth who identify with the LGB community compared to those who do not identify with the community. For LGB individuals, “affiliation, connection, and participation with other ingroup members are shown to be important sources of well-being” (Cox et al., 2010, p. 1207). For 123   example, in a study by Ueno (2005), there were significant and main buffering effects by the number of sexual minority friends that LGB adolescents had. Ueno (2005) found that having more sexual minority friends significantly benefited sexual minority individuals as it was associated with reduced psychological harm related to problems at school or issues with parents, reduced effects related to victimization, and less depression over time (Ueno, 2005). Relatedly, though dating comes with barriers, as explored in Chapter III, some research has found that dating same-sex partners is related to positive outcomes for LGB youth, including improved mental health, increases in self-esteem, lower substance use, and decreases in internalized homophobia (Bauermeister et al., 2010; Russell, Watson & Muraco, 2012; Russell & Consolacion, 2003). One study found that the effects of minority stress on LGB youth’s well-being were lessened when they had a romantic partner (Baams et al., 2014). Community Support De Lira and de Morais (2018) completed a literature review exploring general resilience among the LGB population and examined factors contributing to community resilience. They found several main contributors to community resilience, which underscore the importance of collective identity and the community itself being an agent of resilience. One factor discussed by Mason et al. (2015) is the idea of collective self-esteem, which encompasses the pride of belonging to the LGB community. Another factor is the idea of cultural identity, which relates to the feeling of belongingness in being a part of the LGB community, sharing similar interests and values with others in the community, and feeling a sense of connectedness to others through an understanding of equality (DiFulvio, 2011; Zimmerman et al., 2015). An additional factor is the understanding among those within the community that there are shared challenges and a collective struggle that all are a part of an experience (DiFulvio, 2011). Kubicek et al. (2013) 124   explored social creativity, which is about seeking support as a community to work together and cope with stressful or difficult situations. Another factor contributing to resilience within the community is the development of subcultures, which serve as safe spaces for individuals to celebrate and express their sexual orientation (Kubicek et al., 2013). Community resilience is also fostered through a collective belief and expectation that challenges will be overcome (DiFulvio, 2011). Additionally, DiFulvio (2011) also discusses the idea of social activism within the community, where everyone works together to change social attitudes. De Lira and de Morais (2018) noted that much of the literature around resilience often focuses on individual and contextual aspects of an individual’s life, but it is important that resilience should not only be considered in relation to individual characteristics. They emphasized that it is important not to minimize the role of the social environment, which can promote or inhibit resilience through social, political, economic, and cultural forces. In particular, they noted that resilience can also be facilitated by environmental factors such as inclusive social and public policies that impact all, but especially for marginalized communities, such as policy around public health, education, and social services. For example, when school environments are protective, affirming, and feel safe, it benefits the mental health of LGBTQ youth by leading to reduced SOV, harassment, depressive symptoms, substance use, suicidal thoughts, attempts, and negative effects of victimization, as well as increased feelings of safety and better psychological health outcomes as young adults (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Goodenow et al., 2006; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2013; Konishi & Saewyc, 2014; Kosciw et al., 2014; Poteat et al., 2013; Russell & Fish, 2016; Toomey et al., 2011). Kosciw et al. (2014) found that fewer experiences of SOV and harassment were reported 125   by students who lived in areas where sexual orientation and gender identity were included in antibullying laws compared to students who lived in areas without these laws. One way to provide support to students is through offering school-based LGBTQ support groups (Asakura, 2016; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2013; Kosciw et al., 2012), like gay-straight alliances (GSA). Research has found that LGBTQ students in schools with supportive programming and resources such as GSAs were less likely than students in schools without these resources to report depression, substance use, or suicidal ideation, and they reported feeling safer at school (Goodenow et al., 2006; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2013; Poteat et al., 2013). Furthermore, the positive effects of school-based LGBTQ support groups have been shown to continue into later developmental stages. Toomey et al. (2011) found reduced negative effects of SOV on well-being and reports of better psychological health in young adulthood among individuals who participated in the GSA at their school and felt their GSA promoted safety. Heck et al. (2011) found that individuals who attended a school with a GSA tended to demonstrate reduced levels of problematic alcohol use, fewer depressive symptoms, and lower psychological distress in young adulthood. Individuals who attended schools with GSAs also reported significantly higher ratings of school belonging and significantly lower rates of sexual-orientation-based victimization at school compared to individuals who attended schools without GSAs (Heck et al., 2011). In addition to laws and resources, LGBTQ students are more likely to experience better psychological adjustment, such as increased sense of safety, feelings of acceptance, and reduced experiences of victimization, when school policies and curricula are inclusive and LGBTQ-focused (Black et al., 2012; Kosciw et al., 2012; Kosciwet al., 2014; Toomey et al., 2012). Additional training and education for teachers, staff, and peers leads to increased understanding 126   of and empathy for LGBTQ students, which is associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in LGBTQ-affirming behaviors and intervening in discriminatory or homophobic situations (Greytak et al., 2013; Greytak & Kosciw, 2014; Kosciw et al., 2012; Poteat, 2015). Additionally, resilience and positive outcomes are fostered when students can feel a sense of school connectedness or knowing a caring teacher or other caring adult (Asakura, 2016; Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Konishi & Saewyc, 2014). This also applies for young adults in college, as relationships with faculty on college campuses can be supportive for LGBTQ students and have been found to be positively related to the academic progress and social integration of LGBTQ students in college (Linley et al., 2016; Woodford et al., 2015). Linley et al. (2016) found that LGBTQ students felt supported by their faculty when homophobia in the classroom was confronted, heterosexist and cisgender norms or discourse in the curriculum were challenged, inclusive language was used, diversity and multiculturalism such as LGBTQ topics and people were included in the curriculum, faculty were knowledgeable about LGBTQ issues, students’ preferred names and pronouns were used, advising was open and affirming, support and listening about non-academic areas of life were provided, LGBTQ faculty and staff are open and visible on campus, and faculty identify as allies and let students know their offices are safe spaces for LGBTQ individuals and issues. Woodford et al. (2015) found that the negative effects of campus climate relating to heterosexist harassment on depression and anxiety were moderated by physical exercise. Additionally, they observed that the negative effects of risk for alcohol abuse were moderated by self-esteem and having LGB friends (Woodford et al., 2015). Finally, they noticed that the negative effects on physical health symptoms were moderated by relationships with instructors (Woodford et al., 2015). These findings add additional support to the notion that social support 127   and positive coping skills can help change the impact of discrimination on college campuses (Woodford et al., 2015). A study by Hatzenbuehler et al. (2011) examined the protective effects of a social/contextual factor in psychiatric morbidity among LGB individuals in the United States. They utilized data from the second wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, which is an epidemiological survey completed through interviews with U.S. adults. The authors specifically examined the impact of same-sex couple concentration/density on the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders among LGB individuals in states with higher and lower concentrations of same-sex couples. They also examined whether living in a state with a higher concentration of same-sex couples would buffer against the effects of economic adversity and social isolation, two risk factors associated with the development of psychopathology (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2011). The researchers found lower past-year prevalence of major depression and generalized anxiety among LGB individuals who lived in states with higher concentrations of same-sex couples than among those living in low-concentration states (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2011). They also found that LGB individuals who were exposed to economic adversity and social isolation were only at an increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders in states with a low concentration of same-sex couples. Social isolation was also specifically related to social phobia among LGB individuals in low-concentration states. The researchers did not find these interactions between risk and protective factors among heterosexual individuals, which led them to suggest that these effects may be specific to LGB individuals. They also suggested that these results support the idea that some social/contextual factors, such as concentration of same-sex couples, may have a protective effect on LGB mental health. Protective social/contextual factors are important to 128   explore as part of public health, as targeting these factors through policy or structural interventions may allow for opportunities to address population-wide mental health concerns, versus just implementing interventions at the individual level (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2011). An important part of understanding and exploring resilience is assessing factors that present risk as well as protection for a population of people. Protective factors work to mitigate the impact or outcomes of risk factors, generally leading to some positive adaptation for the individual. Protective factors come from many sources, including internal factors that can come from within the individual and external factors, which come from family, social networks, and the broader community, society, or system an individual lives within. This chapter explored these various factors and how they lend support to LGB youth and young adults. Research on internal factors has found that social support has shown a direct relationship to psychological well-being, though it also works through a stress-buffering mechanism (Kwon, 2013). Psychological health and well-being are also impacted by emotional openness, hope, and optimism through stress buffering (Kwon, 2013). Resilience is fostered through health-promoting thoughts and behaviors in addition to social supports (Harper et al., 2014). Psychological hardiness is also associated with better mental and physical health (Figueroa & Zoccola, 2015). Disclosing one’s identity is related to positive psychosocial adjustment, more family support, reduced depression, and improved well-being in adulthood, particularly when LGB youth have come out in high school (D’Augelli, 2002; Luhtanen, 2002; Morris et al., 2001; Russell et al., 2014; Russell & Fish, 2016). Outness has also been demonstrated to reduce the negative effects of victimization (Kosciw et al., 2015). For some LGB individuals, religious faith can impact resiliency, particularly with the complex relationship between faith and the Black community (Walker & Longmire-Avital, 2013). High identity integration is associated with 129   better psychological adjustment, such as less anxiety, depression, and conduct problems, as well as higher self-esteem compared with low integration (Rosario et al., 2011). Research on external factors has shown that family acceptance of an LGBTQ youth’s identity is associated with positive mental and physical health in young adulthood. Specifically, support and acceptance are associated with higher self-esteem, social support, and general health (Ryan et al., 2010). Family support, acceptance, and connectedness are protective factors against depression, substance use, self-injury, and suicidal ideation and attempts among LGBTQ youth (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Reisner et al., 2014; Ryan et al., 2010). Additionally, having a supportive parent or teacher in their life significantly reduces the likelihood that sexual minority youth will experience social, emotional, or educational difficulties. Research on external factors has demonstrated that social support is related to many positive outcomes including reduced psychological distress (Mustanski et al., 2011), decreased self-concealment (Potoczniak et al., 2007), openness about one’s identity (Shilo & Savaya, 2011), facilitated ego identity development (Potoczniak et al., 2007), reduced internalized homonegativity (Bauermeister et al., 2010; Cox et al., 2010; Russell & Consolacion, 2003; Russell, Watson & Muraco, 2012), higher identity integration (Rosario et al., 2011), acceptance of one’s identity (Shilo & Savaya, 2011), improved psychological adjustment including reduced depression and anxiety and increased self-esteem (Bauermeister et al., 2010; Pellicane et al., 2021; Rosario et al., 2011; Russell & Consolacion, 2003; Russell, Watson & Muraco, 2012; Ryan et al., 2017; Ueno, 2005), and improved well-being and autonomy support (Ryan et al., 2017; Shilo & Savaya, 2011). Peer support is also a protective factor for LGB youth mental health, as it has been found to buffer adverse effects (e.g., anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation) of negative attitudes, rejection, and victimization from family, lack of family support, loss of 130   friends, and minority stress (Baams et al., 2014; Carastathis et al., 2017; D’Augelli, 2003; Parra et al., 2018). External factors of resilience for the LGB community also involve the idea of community resilience. Research indicates that community resilience is built from collective self-esteem (Mason et al., 2015), cultural identity (DiFulvio, 2011; Zimmerman et al., 2015), shared challenges and a collective struggle (DiFulvio, 2011), social creativity (Kubicek et al., 2013), subcultures (Kubicek et al., 2013), collective belief of overcoming challenges (DiFulvio, 2011), and social activism (DiFulvio, 2011). In addition to factors that impact individual and community resilience, the social environment plays a significant role in the development of resilience, as social, political, economic, and cultural forces can promote or inhibit the processes of resilience (de Lira & de Morais, 2018). Social and public policies regarding public health, education, and social services impact resilience, such that resilience can be facilitated when these policies are inclusive of all people (de Lira & de Morais, 2018). When local laws and school policies are inclusive and protective of LGBTQ individuals, the result is increased feelings of safety, reduced experiences of victimization and discrimination, and improved psychological health and well-being (Black et al., 2012; Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Goodenow et al., 2006; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2013; Konishi & Saewyc, 2014; Kosciw et al., 2014; Kosciw et al., 2012; Poteat et al., 2013; Russell & Fish, 2016; Toomey et al., 2012, 2011). Implementing school-based LGBTQ support groups, like GSA, has demonstrated positive effects such as reduced depression, substance use, suicidal ideation, psychological distress, and sexual-orientation-based victimization (Goodenow et al., 2006; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2013; Heck et al., 2011; Poteat et al., 2013). The reduced negative effects, improved well-being, and psychological health connected to GSAs have been found to carry into young adulthood (Toomey et al., 2011). Training and 131   education for teachers, staff and peers lead to increased understanding of and empathy for LGBTQ students, which can increase the chances of those individuals being affirming to and intervening for LGBTQ students (Greytak et al., 2013; Greytak & Kosciw, 2014; Kosciw et al., 2012; Poteat, 2015). Increases in affirming and supportive behaviors among heterosexual individuals and that teachers or adults in their lives care about them can result in LGBTQ students feeling supported, which can help with fostering resilience and positive outcomes (Asakura, 2016; Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Konishi & Saewyc, 2014; Linley et al., 2016). Even factors like community makeup can impact mental health and act as protective factors for LGB, such as findings of lower prevalence of depression and anxiety among LGB individuals who live in states with a greater concentration of same-sex couples (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2011). Research on resilience demonstrates that there are many avenues through which resilience is fostered on the individual, community, and societal levels, which can have a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals overall. There is still so much more to explore, as resilience research is still new and more limited for the LGB community in particular. However, when looking to support LGB college students, knowledge on LGB resilience and its impact on overall well-being and mental health can be a foundation for understanding the importance of fostering individual resilience and how the use of social support, connection to the broader LGBTQ community, and advocating for societal support through change of policy and law are the avenues through which individual resilience and success can be promoted. Thus far, this paper has investigated the approximate prevalence of SAD among LGB college students. It has also considered the risk factors that affect the lives of many LGB college students that could lead to the development of SAD. It explored potential internal and external 132   protective factors that might mitigate those risks for LGB college students. With a better understanding of the experience and impact of SAD on LGB college students, the next step is to determine what can be done directly and indirectly to support these students. Intervention Understanding the risk factors and impact of SAD on LGB college students can provide insight on how to approach treatment intervention and prevention strategies for LGB individuals. This section explores areas of consideration for therapy, therapy interventions, and community interventions for LGB individuals. Therapy Interventions For therapy interventions to be appropriate and effective, cultural and intersectional considerations should be made to tailor treatment to the client’s experiences and needs. Dürrbaum and Sattler (2020) suggested that interventions that support coping with minority stress, such as support groups, family interventions, or therapy to reduce minority stress, be specially targeted to LGB youth and address those difficult experiences associated with minority sexual identity, such as victimization, rejection from family and peers, and internalized homonegativity and binegativity. The role of constructs such as rumination, perceived burdensomeness, and rejection sensitivity in relation to minority stress and mental health should also be considered in the treatment of LGB individuals (Russell & Fish, 2016). Research by Hatzenbuehler et al. (2009) found an association between higher rates of stigma-related stressors and elevated levels of psychological distress among LGB individuals, with that association being the strongest among individuals who reported more experiences of rumination after facing stigma-related stress. Russell and Fish (2016) suggested that these results may demonstrate the importance of emotion regulation in the minority stress process, which may have implications for 133   treatment in relation to experienced stigma, such as utilizing interventions that focus on targeting maladaptive cognitions such as rumination. In another study, Baams et al. (2015) found that perceived burdensomeness mediated a link between minority stress and mental health in LGB youth, where feeling that they were a burden to others was elicited by minority stress and the burdensome feelings were strongly associated with experiences of depression and suicidal ideation. They also found that perceived burdensomeness accounted for the whole link between thwarted belongingness and mental health (Baams et al., 2015). These results propose that burdensome feelings, and the reduction of such, may be an important area to focus on in treatment, and that belonging may not be a critical mechanism despite being such a strong focus in general LGBTQ mental health (Russell & Fish, 2016). Pachankis et al. (2008) explored the relationship between parental rejection, gay-related rejection sensitivity, and internalized homophobia and found that the relationship between parental rejection and rejection sensitivity is mediated by internalized homophobia. They also found that unassertive interpersonal behaviors were significantly influenced by gay-related rejection sensitivity. A major takeaway from this study was finding empirical support for the common clinical presentations of the impact that past sexual-orientation-based rejection has on LGBTQ individuals’ current psychological functioning. In another study, McLaughlin et al. (2010) found a higher likelihood of psychiatric disorders among individuals who did not acknowledge or avoided discussing experiences of bias-based discrimination. Russell and Fish (2016) suggested that based on these studies, it could be helpful to use interventions that intend to understand the experiences of discrimination and stigma-related rejection, as well as the impact and meanings taken from these experiences. 134   Highlighting this research allows note of many psychological mechanisms and constructs that could be important to address with LGBTQ youth in treatment (Russell & Fish, 2016). In this small study interviewing LGB youth, Diamond et al. (2011) noted some important considerations for treatment with LGB youth, which included the youths’ own desires for their parents to be more accepting and to attend family therapy. Diamond et al. (2011) tested a treatment approach intended to address suicidality among LGB youth that was family-based and adapted from attachment-based family therapy. The treatment provided parents space to process their feelings about their child’s sexual orientation, as well as to learn about and become more aware of their reactions to their child’s orientation that could be diminishing or harmful. With this treatment approach, the LGB youth reported significant reductions in depression and suicidality. The researchers also noted success of the approach in the high levels of retention, which would be important for any treatment to be effective. The inclusion of family in therapy, as well as the provision of space for parents to process their own feelings and receive psychoeducation regarding the impact of their reactions, is an important component to address since the risks related to parental rejection can have significant implications for LGB individuals’ mental health and well-being, as discussed in Chapter III. In addition to therapy for the parents and families of LGBTQ individuals, other resources that provide information, education, resources, and support can be beneficial. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration provides a resource guide for practitioners to help them meet families where they are and help families learn how to support their LGBTQ children (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). The resource guide discusses the role that families play in reducing risk and promoting well-being among LGBTQ youth, highlighting how crucial rejection and acceptance are to LGBTQ youth’s mental 135   health. The resource guide includes recommendations for educating and involving parents and families in interventions to affirm their children’s LGBTQ identities. The resource guide is research based and provides approaches to working with families, resources for increasing family support, educational resources for families including breakdowns of research findings on family support, intervention videos, assessment tools, and intervention strategies for families in supporting their children. They emphasize the importance of engaging LGBTQ youth’s families in supporting their children, in a way that is accessible and easy to utilize and engage with, which can be a great tool for many families who are unsure of where to start (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). Often, LGBTQ individuals present for individual therapy. Therefore, it is important to research and explore treatment interventions that focus on or incorporate LGBTQ-related factors, such as community-specific issues or experiences. For example, Pachankis et al. (2015) explored the efficacy of a 10-session intervention adapted from the Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (Barlow et al., 2010). Their adaptation, the Effective Skills to Empower Effective Men project, focused on stigma-related stressors and minority stress experiences among young gay and bisexual men to reduce minority stress processes and enhance stigma coping. In the study, participants were randomly assigned to an immediate treatment group or a three-month waitlist. Self-report assessments and an interview were used to evaluate mental health, minority stress, and risk behavior at baseline, three-month, and six-month follow-ups. After treatment, they found significant reductions and clinically significant improvements in depressive symptoms, alcohol use problems, and sexual compulsivity compared to the waitlist group. They also observed significant improvement for minority stress post-treatment. The researchers noted that the overall effects of this intervention 136   were comparable to those found for other CBT interventions. They discussed that this intervention could be expanded or adapted for clinical work with women and LGBTQ youth (Pachankis et al., 2015). When considering treatment interventions for working with LGBTQ individuals and reducing minority stress, it is important to explore how to foster resilience. Kwon (2013) indicated that it is of paramount importance to understand resilience among LGB individuals and the factors that can lead to flourishment and fulfillment so that practitioners can develop interventions that are effective for the LGB community. They suggested some interventions that could support specific factors that play a role in resilience, for example, the use of behavioral activation to assist in increasing social activity and engaging with others to improve social support. Another example is facilitating emotional openness through use of emotion-focused and interpersonal approaches to treatment. Regarding hope and optimism, they considered cognitive behavioral therapy and the use of positive appraisals to improve an individual’s outlook and beliefs regarding the future. Additionally, they mentioned that primary prevention efforts have been beneficial for other stigmatized groups, so they considered the effectiveness of utilizing interventions to increase hope and optimism among LGB youth. Leleux-Labarge et al. (2015) also suggested considering the role of constructs such as psychological inflexibility, particularly as it relates to self-concealment, in an LGB client’s distress and the potential benefits of acceptance-based interventions. In a study exploring clinical intervention, Pachankis and Goldfried (2010) found improvement in psychosocial functioning and openness about sexual orientation among gay male college students who engaged in expressive writing that focused on gay-related stressors, particularly for individuals who wrote about serious subjects or indicated 137   having less social support. These different examples demonstrate that there are a variety of approaches to treatment interventions that can support resilience-promoting factors. Similar to tailoring treatment with the client’s cultural and identity factors in mind, treatment should also be specific to the presenting concerns or disorder a client is experiencing. Regarding SAD, Nordstrom et al. (2014) suggested addressing social anxiety and targeting it with CBT approaches when students arrive in college and utilizing social exposure through the built-in environment of peers and possible use of group therapy. They also suggested targeting self-esteem, as it was found to be a mediational factor partially explaining the influence of social anxiety on students’ adjustment. Ideas for intervention included increasing or strengthening self-esteem through the use of humanistic principles like strength-based approaches and CBT-based approaches such as reducing self-criticism, changing cognitive distortions, and increasing assertiveness and positive reinforcement. They suggested schools possibly using a standardized process to screen and identify students with social anxiety to engage early interventions during students’ first semester and providing support with transitional challenges. Additionally, connecting students to peer leaders as a supplement for social interactions and support could assist socially anxious students, as they indicated increased persistence, satisfaction, and feelings of belonging have been shown when relationships are built between peer leaders and first-year students. This approach incorporates many more interventions than just one-on-one individual therapy, including screening processes for early intervention and incorporating peer support into treatment (Nordstrom et al., 2014). As important as it is to find the interventions and treatment options that will be effective, it is just as important to learn what interventions are not as beneficial to treatment. For example, Sailer and Hazlett-Stevens (2011) found that the addition of interoceptive exposure exercises 138   with the intention of eliciting feared bodily sensations does not appear to have any clinical benefit and does not seem necessary when working with college students who have social anxiety, as it did not provide any more resolution than just exposure to a social situation. Knowing that interoceptive exposure exercises will not add any clinical benefit can save a clinician and client time and energy when planning treatment, which is especially important in college counseling settings where short-term and often solution-focused treatment is a primary modality of treatment. The primary purpose of this project has been to glean information on SAD among LGB college students. The next two studies discussed were the only two found in the literature search completed for this paper that explored interventions for SAD among LGBTQ individuals. Roberts et al. (2011) discussed the use of cognitive behavioral therapy to reduce symptoms of SAD and how its effectiveness with adults, adolescents, and LGBTQ adults may translate to usefulness with young LGBTQ individuals. The researchers indicated that interventions for prevention could also assist with concerns around alcohol and substance use, risky sexual behavior, lack of social support, depression, and suicidality. They highlighted that treatment should not only focus on irrational thoughts; it should acknowledge that many of the challenges in relation to negative social evaluation may stem from actual experiences of minority stress such as bullying, harassment, or isolation; therefore, building skills to manage and cope with these stressors should be emphasized as well. Roberts et al. (2011) also recommended that treatment include some focus on assisting LGBTQ youth in building supportive social networks to bolster the protective effects social support provides. The recommendations provided in this article incorporate a variety of interventions, including CBT exercises, prevention strategies for common risks, consideration for the impact of minority stress, and building social support, which 139   seems to highlight the complexity and added factors that are beneficial to explore when building a treatment plan, especially for individuals who hold any marginalized identity. Walsh and Hope (2010) presented a case study with a 23-year-old European-American male client who presented to a university training clinic with concerns about social anxiety and anxiety related to questioning their sexual identity. They discussed how research indicates the most effective treatment would be cognitive behavioral therapy while also being mindful of incorporating client characteristics and preferences as an important part of the treatment. Treatment consisted of 50 sessions over 18 months and initially focused on the client’s social anxiety using a workbook, Managing Social Anxiety: A Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Approach—Client Workbook (Hope et al., 2000). They identified situations that made the client very anxious and developed a hierarchy of anxiety-provoking situations. The client worked on identifying their automatic thoughts in these anxious situations and eventually learned to identify thinking errors he used and challenge these thoughts. As he learned these skills, he practiced doing them as homework. He was then encouraged to challenge himself and expose himself to some of these difficult situations to practice these skills. As the client’s comfort in these anxiety-provoking situations improved, he seemed more comfortable talking about his challenges with his sexual identity, and the focus of treatment began to shift. It became more evident that his concerns related more to his sexual identity than a general fear of negative evaluation. They spent about 20 sessions exploring and considering his sexual identity, with the therapist following the guidelines of Pachankis and Goldfried (2004) regarding identity development and individuals in the questioning stage of their process. The client expressed many worries about the future and the process, as well as the ramifications, of coming out to his conservative family. Once the client began to personally identify as gay, 140   sessions focused on processing anticipated reactions from those around him if he chose to come out to them. They again began using cognitive restructuring skills for the automatic thoughts around these worries. They used another hierarchy of activities, this time related to his identity, to encourage him to actively explore his identity. They processed his experience after he completed an activity on the hierarchy. As the client became more comfortable, he began coming out to his family and friends who were, to his surprise, mostly accepting and supportive of him. After this, the remaining sessions (36 to 50), were used to explore his identity in relation to his interpersonal world, discussing romantic and sexual relationships, building a supportive social network, and preparing for termination. The client entered their first relationship, and first same-sex relationship, so related concerns and navigating conflicts were discussed in session and communication skills and coping strategies were reviewed (Walsh & Hope, 2010). Throughout treatment, the client’s social anxiety and worry symptoms declined substantially, as seen by his scores on the outcome measures employed. While his symptoms of social anxiety initially declined, they declined even further when treatment shifted to focus more on his identity in treatment. The changes in his scores across sessions 2-12, 14-50, and 2-50 were examined to assess the effectiveness of the various treatments/foci used, as well as the overall therapy process. Comparisons of his fear of negative evaluation scores indicated that the social anxiety treatment used from sessions 2-12 were not effective in reducing his fear of negative evaluation, but the significant decline over sessions 14-50 indicated that the identity-focused treatment was effective in reducing those fears. The therapist suggested that the significant reduction in scores may suggest that exploring his identity and committing to a gay identity helped reduce his fear of negative evaluation, fear of rejection, and general worries. In assessing 141   the client’s worry symptoms, both the social anxiety treatment and identity-focused treatment were effective in reducing his symptoms of worry. Overall, the treatment did appear effective in reducing the client’s social anxiety and worry symptoms. While the identity-focused therapy seemed more effective than the social anxiety treatment, the social anxiety treatment appeared more effective in reducing his worry than his social anxiety symptoms. The authors emphasized that this case highlights the important of referring to empirical literature and incorporating the client’s characteristics and preferences into the treatment plan for effective treatment. While there were limitations to generalizability of the outcomes in this study due to its nature as a case study, it presented a good example of overlapping symptomology and how important it is to be open minded and mindful in conceptualizing and working with clients from a marginalized population. It could be easy to overlook the client’s identity factors and the role they played in his experience of anxiety and worry if a clinician were only to focus on his presenting symptoms in treatment, which would miss significant factors at play that not only had an impact on the client’s mental health, but also were very important for the client to have space to explore. This case study also highlights the idea that practitioners should be careful in their clinical work not to over-pathologize symptoms that may be reasonable for the client’s context, in this case, being anxious and having worries about identifying as gay and the potential implications arising from that. The context related to the client’s identity plays a crucial role in how one conceptualizes his experiences. While this was a very thorough and lengthy course of treatment, which the authors acknowledged was due to the setting and fee structure allowing for no session limit, this would likely not be an ideal or achievable course of treatment in many college counseling centers due to the short-term nature of 142   treatment in many of these settings in relation to lack of resources and at times, session limits (Walsh & Hope, 2010). Community Interventions D’Augelli and Hershberger (1993) recommended continued establishment and use of programs in schools and the community that provide comprehensive and targeted crisis intervention, support, and socialization interventions toward LGB youth, specifically interventions to attend to issues such as self-esteem, alcohol abuse, peers, and family. Some education-specific recommendations include programs that discuss sexual orientation, such as information to dispel myths and misconceptions about sexual orientation, the impact of loss of friends and negative peer reactions from disclosure of one’s identity, and inclusive HIV educational programs that do not other or separate LGB youth. Russell and Fish (2016) discussed the importance of teachers, support, and policies in schools. Research has found that there is an association between student safety and adjustment and nondiscrimination/antibullying policies or laws that are inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity (Hatzenbuehler & Keyes, 2013; Russell et al., 2010). These kinds of policies and laws permit teachers, administrators, and staff at schools to build an atmosphere that can then support the policies and practices that can promote a positive school environment, feelings of safety, achievement, positive mental health, and overall well-being of students (Russell & Fish, 2016; Russell & McGuire, 2008). Russell, Seif, and Truong (2001) found that establishing a positive school environment for students, especially LGBTQ students, depends significantly on the teachers, who can promote LGBTQ student well-being with the use of LGBTQ-inclusive teacher trainings and curricula that discuss the LGBTQ community and community-specific issues (Snapp et al., 2015). Research has shown that students having more affirming interactions 143   with their peers, experiencing a positive school environment, and demonstrating better adjustment is strongly associated with the presence of student-led groups or clubs, information on LGBTQ issues, and support for LGBTQ issues in schools (Poteat, 2015; Poteat et al., 2013; Toomey et al., 2011). The literature on intervention strategies for LGB individuals discussed individual treatment interventions, community interventions, and considerations for treating LGB college students. The studies examined the role of constructs related to mental health and minority stress, how they interact, and how they might impact treatment planning and focus. The importance of family support and the significant impact that familial rejection of one’s sexual minority identity were discussed, as well as the benefit of resources for LGB individuals’ families, such as education, support, and therapy of their own. Different ideas for interventions in individual therapy were explored, with common interventions including incorporating CBT techniques, minority stress-focused coping, and building of social supports. Reviewing this literature further demonstrated the gap in research concerning social anxiety among LGB college students in general, especially a lack of research addressing the treatment of this relatively common concern among the LGB college student population. Prevention of Risk for LGBTQ Individuals While intervention is necessary when risk is present and has begun to impact people, in an ideal world, preventative strategies could be employed to reduce risk and negative experiences. Understanding the risk factors that impact LGB individuals and can lead to mental health concerns like SAD can guide the development of preventative efforts to protect and support LGB individuals against that risk of negative outcomes. This section explores literature on strategies for prevention of risk among LGB individuals. 144   Roberts et al. (2011) discussed the negative experiences LGBTQ youth encounter, such as bullying, victimization, social isolation, and loss of friends and family, during their very important developmental years. As these experiences can predispose LGBTQ youth to develop SAD and other mental health issues, they indicate that it is important to reduce these negative experiences through preventative efforts, especially in schools, as youth spend a significant amount of time in school, and so much of their development occurs there. They emphasize that efforts focused on school safety and protecting LGBTQ youth, decreasing social stigma toward LGBTQ youth, and educating other students, faculty, staff and families on the importance of support for LGBTQ youth, as well as the significant impact of bullying and harassment, are critical (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Garofalo et al., 1998; Roberts et al., 2011). Mustanski et al. (2011) advocated for addressing victimization directly, as support from others can only help LGBTQ individuals to some degree, but it cannot negate the negative effects of victimization. They suggested utilizing programs such as safe school coalitions (Perrotti & Westheimer, 2001), which work to reduce bullying and violence directed at LGB youth in schools, as well as provide resources and skills-based training for school staff to help them meet the needs of sexual minority youth and families. Fish and Pasley (2015) indicated that advocating for acceptance of and providing education on sexual and gender minorities through LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum, school programming, and policy could reach all students, including those who do not yet acknowledge or know their attraction or identity, which is particularly important as individuals who are questioning their sexuality or do not acknowledge their sexuality have an elevated risk for depressive symptoms, suicidality, and alcohol use. They suggested ways to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment include establishing gay/straight alliances and 145   implementing policies and providing training on sexual orientation, gender identity, and bias-based victimization. Mustanski et al. (2011) suggested creating supportive environments, such as LGBTQ youth centers, to facilitate peer support through socialization and connection to other sexual minority youth who can relate to them and their experiences. In attempting to assess when interventions could be most helpful to LGB individuals, Fish and Pasley (2015) found that there was an acceleration in level of alcohol use for LGB people during the transition to adulthood, moving from the lowest levels of use in adolescence to the highest levels of use in adulthood. Considering this information, they indicated that implementing strategies for prevention and intervention to reduce excessive alcohol use may be especially important during this transitional period for the LGB population (Fish & Pasley, 2015). Ellis (2009) suggested that embedding LGBTQ issues into curriculum content at universities is a powerful and effective strategy for increasing awareness, as the university can reliably engage a larger audience to address prejudice and discrimination and work toward fostering a more positive and inclusive campus climate. Further, they noted that establishing a campus climate of zero tolerance of prejudice, harassment, and discrimination is necessary for LGBTQ students to feel safe and for allies to be empowered to challenge homophobia. To do this, they discussed proactive actions by universities, including implementing policies, initiating sanctions for prejudice, and including LGBTQ issues in broader inclusivity efforts (Ellis, 2009). Taylor (2015) explored the steps community colleges can take to create an inclusive LGBTQ culture on campus based on research from other community colleges, four-year colleges, and large universities. They indicated that the most important action a school can take is to make an institutional commitment to support LGBTQ students, which includes strategically 146   engaging the campus and elevating LGBTQ students and LGBTQ issues to the campus level. They indicated that a commitment from institutional leadership provides a clear message to the campus community and can allow long-term support for LGBTQ students. They suggested creating a task force, which would require financial resources and a letter or statement from the president to announce the new efforts and demonstrate the commitment to supporting LGBTQ students. They recommended conducting a campus climate survey and needs assessment to assess the campus climate, experiences on the campus, and the needs of LGBTQ students. These surveys provide baseline information about LGBTQ students on campus, including the students’ needs, how they perceive campus, what their experiences are like in and outside of class, whether they feel safe, and any issues they may have. The data collected could guide the campus actions to support LGBTQ students. The next step is to provide training and professional development to school faculty and staff so they can begin to identify and mitigate heterosexism. They indicated that a common strategy is the use of ally or safe zone training, though making this training optional includes the risk that staff who could benefit from it may not be the ones who attend. Additionally, having faculty integrate LGBTQ topics and authors into their curriculum could help challenge heteronormative assumptions and biases in class topics and activities. Another step is to create space for and facilitate peer outreach and leadership, where LGBTQ students and heterosexual students directly engage in outreach programming related to LGBTQ issues. These can include delivering panel presentations, peer presentations, or other events, even integrating these kinds of presentations into regular programming or general education classes. This is important as research has suggested peer-to-peer engagement on LGBTQ issues could reduce heterosexist attitudes among heterosexual students (Taylor, 2015). 147   Finally, they recommended allocating LGBTQ-specific resources and making LGBTQ-inclusive policy changes. A significant campus resource that can support LGBTQ students is an LGBTQ resource center with professional support staff for LGBTQ students. Often, LGBTQ resource centers have a director that oversees campus-wide LGBTQ programming, advises student groups, consults other campus entities, and represents the LGBTQ community on committees. Policy changes can also be meaningful for LGBTQ students, including expanding nondiscrimination statements, creating faculty and staff training requirements, instituting policies on curriculum inclusivity, or establishing gender-neutral restrooms. This is not a comprehensive list of all the tasks a school needs to undertake to create an inclusive campus, but merely a place to start based on steps taken by other schools to improve the environment for their LGBTQ students (Taylor, 2015). Poynter and Washington (2005) discussed the idea of holding multiple identities or the vast diversity on college campuses and the intersectionality that comes with that diversity, particularly among individuals in the LGBTQ community. They explored the challenges of creating community on campus, as individuals who hold multiple identities may experience conflict between those identities or not feel that they have space within the communities they belong to because of the other identities that they hold and the biases between these communities. Some examples included being religious in the LGBTQ community and being Black within the LGBTQ community. They indicated that campus staff has a role in creating a just, civil, and open, multicultural community and emphasized creating spaces, programs, discussions, and living-learning communities for students to express themselves. They ended with suggestions to foster discussion, including allowing students to name themselves and their identities; engaging all students in discussions about race, religion, and other identities they hold; 148   working with multicultural or religious leaders on campus to discuss gender and sexual identity, inviting experts to speak on campus, and finding role models on campus who can speak to holding multiple identities (Poynter & Washington, 2005). The literature on risk prevention strategies for LGB individuals discussed efforts for creating safe environments and improving climate, reducing social stigma and victimization, providing support, and facilitating education among non-LGBTQ individuals. Much of the focus was primarily on academic settings, where LGBTQ youth and young adults often spend a significant portion of their time. Some ideas to facilitate these efforts included implementing inclusive curriculum, programming, and policies; creating safe, supportive spaces for expression and employing supportive programs such as safe school coalitions and GSA to facilitate peer support; demonstrating institutional support and commitment to the LGBTQ community; and allocating LGBTQ-specific resources. In considering how LGB college students can be supported as young adults and in an attempt to thwart the onset or worsening of mental health concerns, particularly social anxiety, several themes emerged across individual treatment interventions, community support, and considerations for the treatment of LGB college students. The first theme was an emphasis on support to cope with life stressors as well as minority stress. This includes the use of family and friend support, encouragement to include families in treatment if desired or warranted, and to provide resources and information to families, especially around the importance of their support for their LGB family member. This also included utilizing treatment interventions that are tailored to the LGBTQ population, that are mindful of their experiences with minority stress, and appropriate for the client’s stage of identity development. This entails using evidence-based practices while infusing client characteristics and preferences into treatment to ensure it best fits 149   their needs. Some effective treatment has focused on CBT skills, including identifying automatic negative thoughts, thinking errors, and thought challenges. Treatment can include creating space for and encouraging individual expression that focuses on gay-related stressors, as well as improving coping skills and emotion regulation to manage feelings and reduce minority stress. It is also important to acknowledge and validate clients’ experiences of minority stress, allow space and encourage them to talk about it, and work toward understanding their experiences of discrimination and the impact those experiences have had on them. Clinicians should try to understand LGBTQ resilience, including how they can support and facilitate it. The research also emphasized the importance of providing support, particularly supportive and safe school environments and community programs/resources (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Fish & Pasley, 2015; Garofalo et al., 1998; Mustanski et al., 2011; Perrotti & Westheimer, 2001; Roberts et al., 2011). Part of this support includes education for peers, teachers, professors, parents, and families to destigmatize LGBTQ identity, teach them how to support LGB students, and to create safer, more supportive spaces for these students. There is an emphasis on making schools safe for LGBTQ youth due to the significant harm discrimination and victimization can cause. Suggestions for improving school safety and establishing a positive school environment include implementing nondiscrimination and antibullying policies and laws to reduce victimization and bullying, training for peers and school staff, including inclusive curriculum and programming, and establishing student-led groups or clubs for LGBTQ youth such as GSA. On college campuses, the climate can be improved similarly through establishing a commitment of support to LGBTQ students and centering LGBTQ issues, making inclusive policy changes, creating inclusive spaces, including LGBTQ programming, integrating inclusive 150   curriculum, creating space for expression, engaging all students on LGBTQ issues, and having difficult conversations with all students.    151   Chapter V: SUMMARY The purpose of this project was to examine the gap in the literature on social anxiety among LGB college students by investigating the prevalence of social anxiety among LGB college students, exploring general and SAD-specific risk factors for LGB college students, and reviewing protective factors and prevention strategies for risk among LGB college students. This is important to explore because there is a significant lack of research and information on the prevalence and impact of SAD among LGB college students, and as this project demonstrated, the gap is wider than anticipated, with limited literature on the prevalence of SAD among the general college and LGB populations overall. Understanding the prevalence of SAD among college-age LGB individuals, the risk factors and impact on this population, and how they can be supported through this significant transition in life may allow for the reduction in or prevent the development of SAD, which may assist these individuals in successfully managing the stressors of college and reaching their goals. This project investigated the prevalence of SAD among LGB college students by reviewing studies on the prevalence of SAD among the general college population and studies on the prevalence of SAD among the broader LGB population. Then, this project explored research on risk factors for SAD in general, risk factors for SAD among the LGB population, general risk factors among the LGB population, and the impact of SAD on college students and LGB individuals. Finally, this project reviewed the literature on protective factors and prevention strategies for risk among LGB individuals. The Prevalence of Social Anxiety Among LGB College Students The first research question examined the prevalence of social anxiety among LGB college students. As research has tended to report a higher prevalence rate of social anxiety and 152   other psychological disorders among LGB individuals, it was hypothesized that LGB college students would also report higher rates of social anxiety than their heterosexual peers. In an attempt to estimate the prevalence of SAD among LGB college students, studies assessing the prevalence of SAD among college students in general and studies assessing the prevalence of SAD among LGB individuals in general were examined. The goal was to use these data to extrapolate an estimated SAD prevalence for LGB college students, as there is a gap in the literature pertaining to this population’s experience of SAD. Caution must be exercised in comparing these populations and studies, in addition to caution around the overall prevalence of SAD in general. Overall, the research appears to be of varying moderate to good quality. There was much variation in the methods used across studies to categorize and measure social anxiety, which can create a challenge of being certain the same construct is being measured, as even small changes in the definition of SAD can significantly skew the prevalence estimates that are found. That was a significant challenge in attempting to compare the results of these studies, as well as determining which results were the most accurate. Similar to the variation in the definition of SAD, there was considerable variation in how sexual orientation was defined, operationalized, and measured across studies, which can skew the sample and impact the results as well. The reviewed research indicated that the prevalence of SAD among college students is likely between 8.5% (Bella & Omigbodun, 2009) and 80% (Ahmad et al., 2017), with the majority of studies falling between 16.4% and 32.8%. The reviewed research demonstrated that the 12-month prevalence of SAD among LGB individuals is likely between 7% (Sandfort et al., 2001) and 15.3% (Sandfort et al., 2014), and the lifetime prevalence of SAD among LGB 153   individuals is likely between 4% (Bostwick et al., 2010) and 27.1% (Meyer et al., 2008), with the majority of lifetime prevalence falling between 14.6% and 27.1%. It would appear that both of these populations demonstrated some common overlap for the majority of the studies, indicating prevalence between 14.6% and 32.8% in the middle range. It would seem likely that the prevalence of SAD for LGB college students would be comparable to this range, with some note that the actual prevalence may be a bit higher, especially for students with any sexual orientation that includes people of the same and different sex or gender from their own. It was worth noting that compared to the suggestions of the overall literature, among these studies that were examined, many of the LGB prevalence rates were slightly lower than the general college student prevalence rates. This may be due to the inconsistencies in measurements across the studies or possibly that the general college student samples were a mixture of heterosexual and sexual minority students. As none of the college population studies reported sexual orientation, it could not be explored further. One consideration was that it might be possible that the prevalence for the college population was higher than for the LGB population, which would have implications for the LGB college student population, whose prevalence of SAD could be even higher than was estimated here. Risk Factors For SAD The second research question examined the risk factors contributing to social anxiety among LGB college students. It was hypothesized that risk factors that contribute to social anxiety among LGB college students would be an intersection of those factors that contribute to social anxiety for other LGB individuals and other college students, such as identity development, social support, minority stress, and significant life transitions. 154   Based on a review of the research, there were many potential contributing risk factors for SAD among the LGB college population. These factors included general etiological factors that are common to all, such as genetic vulnerabilities, neurobiological vulnerabilities, inhibited temperament, poor attachment, negative parenting styles, negative life events, and exposure to conditioning experiences such as traumatic events, social skills deficits, or cognitive biases. Risk factors specific to the LGB population, and therefore to the LGB college student population, included social factors such as peer victimization, minority stress, lack of social or cultural support from society, developmental issues, gender role nonconformity, abusive and negative family experiences, self-concealment, and SOV. SAD’s impact on LGB college students might include difficulty building social support networks that could assist with the transition to college, reduced social support and closeness, and higher levels of homesickness. SAD may lead to academic problems such as lower grades, more absences from class, and a lower GPA. SAD may impact fears of public speaking, lower self-esteem, engagement in risky sexual behaviors, and substance abuse. SAD may contribute to greater mental health symptoms such as cognitive and affective difficulties, somatization, obsessive-compulsive processes, anxious symptoms, depressive symptoms, phobic symptoms, depression, and suicidality. These are not comprehensive lists, as they only consider the factors that have been studied until now. However, both the risks and the potential impacts demonstrate just how limited our knowledge and understanding of mental health is while at the same time highlighting just how unique each person’s experience is to themselves. While it is important to note that this research did not provide information on the directional relationship or causes of social anxiety, these findings are still valuable. Being aware of the potential risk factors and the impact that 155   SAD may have on an individual can assist future conceptualization and treatment, as well as efforts to mitigate or prevent some of these challenges on an individual and broader societal scale. Protective Factors and Prevention for SAD The third research question examined the protective factors that can facilitate resilience against social anxiety among LGB college students. The hypothesis was that the preventative or protective factors of social anxiety for LGB college students would be an intersection of factors that are preventative or protective for LGB individuals and college students overall, such as perceived social support, increased supports on college campuses, accessible resources targeted to this specific population, integrated programming in the orientation process, and reduced stigma surrounding LGB community and mental health overall. Based upon a review of the research, possible protective factors that are associated with positive outcomes for LGB college students included social support, emotional openness, hope, optimism, psychological hardiness, family support, family acceptance, family connectedness, having a supportive parent, teacher, or other adult in one’s life, high identity integration, outness, coming out in high school, disclosing one’s identity, affirming and intervening behaviors from supportive others, and community factors. Community factors included community resilience, connection to the LGBTQ community, the social environment, which included social and public policies/laws regarding public health, education, and social services, training and education on LGBTQ issues for the community, and community makeup such as concentration of LGBTQ individuals in one’s local community. This paper found that resilience is fostered through many avenues, including individual, community, and societal processes. Based upon the research reviewed, specific factors that foster 156   resilience included health-promoting thoughts and behaviors, religious faith for some, particularly for Black LGB individuals for whom religion is often intertwined in culture, and feeling that a teacher or adult in one’s life cares about them. Social support is one of the most studied and seemingly impactful protective factors for LGB individuals, as it is associated with so many positive outcomes, including many of the protective factors listed here as well as acting as a buffer to protect mental health. Social support being significantly important for college student adjustment overall and being necessary for LGB individuals’ well-being emphasizes how crucial social support must be for LGB college students’ adjustment and well-being. On the broader level, individuals can benefit from community resilience and connecting to the LGBTQ community. Community and individual resilience can be impacted by the social environment, which involves forces that can promote or inhibit resilience, including social, political, economic, and cultural forces. For example, social and public policies and laws on public health, education, and social services can impact an individual’s ability to build resilience or be resilient. Inclusive and protective local laws and school policies can facilitate resilience, increase feelings of safety, and reduce victimization and discrimination for LGBTQ individuals. The next step after exploring risk factors and protective factors that can foster resilience was to apply this information. The purpose of exploring this information was to gain an understanding of how to support LGB college students to thwart the onset or worsening of mental health concerns, specifically related to social anxiety, during the transition to adulthood and college. Several themes emerged across individual treatment interventions, community support, and considerations for the treatment of LGB college students. There was an emphasis on peer and family support to cope with life stressors, as well as including these supports in 157   treatment efforts. It is also recommended to use evidence-based practices that are inclusive and tailored to the client’s needs and experiences, especially taking into consideration the stage of development and experiences with minority stress as a sexual minority individual. Another major emphasis was on providing supportive and safe environments for LGBTQ individuals. This includes implementing community and school programs that provide resources to LGBTQ students and families, as well as providing education and training to broader peer, family, and community members so they can learn how to support these individuals and create safer, more supportive environments for them. Schools, in particular, are emphasized due to how much time LGBTQ youth spend there and how prevalent discrimination and victimization are in schools, which are major risks that cause significant negative impacts and harm to LGBTQ individuals. Suggestions for schools and college campuses include implementing nondiscrimination and antibullying policies and laws, education and training, inclusive curriculum and programming, and establishing student-led groups or clubs for LGBTQ individuals. Clinical Usefulness and Implications This project explored a gap in the literature, highlighting that this area would benefit from additional attention and research. The dearth of information around the prevalence and impact of social anxiety on the college population and the LGB population is important because social anxiety is known to be prevalent and chronic, affecting all areas of an individual’s life, but especially impacting the creation of social support networks and therefore access to social supports. Social support is one of the primary protective factors and promoters of resilience among all people, especially in marginalized communities like the LGBTQ community. Knowing that such a prevalent disorder is common among these populations and affects one of the main factors contributing to those individuals’ ability to adjust successfully and to their well-158   being comes with the responsibility of better understanding that disorder, its impact on that population, and how to intervene to assuage its negative effects. This project brings together research on the LGB population and the general college population to consider what the situation (e.g., prevalence, risk factors, protective factors) may look like at the intersection of those two groups, the LGB college student population. This is important as it contributes to the information that clinicians and researchers working with this population may benefit from exploring. This project highlights the estimated high prevalence of social anxiety among the LGB college population, which can alert clinicians that SAD is something to consider and assess in their work with students. Describing the risk and protective factors can help guide clinicians in their assessment and treatment of their clients, especially by emphasizing client strengths and building skills and supports to foster their resilience. Exploring treatment considerations and interventions informs the clinical work that clinicians do with their clients. The emphasis on utilizing evidence-based practices while also infusing minority stress-informed care can allow clinicians to consider how they bring culture and minority stress into their work. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of the use of clinical judgment and collaboration with clients to provide treatment that will be effective for them. Discussing prevention and larger-scale community/societal interventions that can impact the lives of LGBTQ individuals can inform clinicians and researchers, as well as the community, on what kinds of actions can have an impact and make a difference. This can help guide individuals in their practices of advocacy and how they get involved in their community. Limitations This project is a comprehensive literature review used to explore the current research pertaining to social anxiety among LGB college students and to highlight the limited amount of 159   research on this topic that constitutes a gap in the literature. Part of the limitations of this project is the nature of that gap and that there is limited research available to explore. This project attempted to estimate the prevalence of social anxiety among LGB college students, but this is just an estimation through reviewing the literature, and no statistical analysis or procedures were used. Therefore, the results are simply a broad view but not an exact measurement of the prevalence of social anxiety among LGB college students. Another limitation of this project is that the conclusions depend on the research and quality of the research that was reviewed, which impacts the accuracy of what was found. The research reviewed varied significantly regarding techniques, types of study conducted, assessments and definitions, the country completed in, and the populations. This limits the generalizability of the research and subsequently the culmination of the findings. The summary of risk factors, protective factors, and ideas for prevention and interventions are also limited to findings in the existing literature. This project is also limited by the research that could be accessed during the research procedure. Recommendations for Future Research In some of the more recent studies reviewed, the researchers have already worked toward making adjustments to their research design based on past completed analysis and recommendations, which improved the research compared to past concerns. Researchers continuing to make these adjustments based on recommendations will continue to improve the quality of the body of literature. Based on the reviews in this project, future research would benefit from using more standardized or consistent methods for study set up and completion. This standardization could include ideal procedures for collecting prevalence data, particularly among small populations that historically have been challenging to collect accurate and representative information about. Part of this standardization could also include using more clear 160   and consistent definitions and operationalizations of the variables being studied. For example, in the research reviewed in this project, a significant critique is the wide variation in how sexual orientation and social anxiety were defined and measured. The variations in these definitions can alter the data and resulting findings. With consideration of intersectionality, a significant issue in the body of literature is the need for research on the experiences of LGBTQ people of color. Not only is research on the experience of LGBTQ people of color lacking, the research that does exist has been primarily completed by White researchers. Future research should specifically explore the intersection of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation, to learn more about and understand the experience of LGBTQ people of color. This future research should center the voices of LGBTQ people of color and be conducted through an intersectional lens.  Additionally, finding one or a few valid and reliable measures or assessments to be widely used across studies could help alleviate concerns about the construct being measured and ensure that studies contribute to the knowledge of the same construct. Furthermore, the variations in these definitions and their use, particularly around identity variables like sexual orientation, can be very impactful by the language used. Use of inclusive language and being mindful of how we choose to describe groups of people is important to avoid invalidating people’s lived experiences. This also applies to language used in the measures and assessments utilized; it is important to use measures that use inclusive language for the population one is working with.  Based on the findings of this project from the research that was reviewed, the literature is missing information on the prevalence, risk factors, and protective factors for social anxiety among LGB college students. It would benefit LGB college students for social anxiety to be a 161   topic of focus to facilitate the creation of interventions and prevention strategies that will support these students and allow them to be successful. LGB college students would benefit from therapeutic interventions that integrate their identities and address experiences of minority stress, campus wide policies and actions that integrate LGBTQ issues into programming, curriculum, and socialization; and prevention programming aimed at identifying and supporting vulnerable students early in their college career. These students would also benefit from the creation and maintenance of safe, supportive LGBTQ spaces on campus where they can connect with others and build community. While these spaces do exist on many campuses, students are not always aware of them, so greater awareness and promotion of these spaces from all campus entities would help reach more students.     162   References Adewuya, A.

    "abstract": "This project examined the gap in the literature on LGB college students and social anxiety. The dearth of information around the prevalence and impact of social anxiety on the college population and the LGB population is important because social anxiety is known to be prevalent and chronic, affecting all areas of an individual’s life, but especially impacting the creation of social support networks and therefore access to social supports. Social support is one of the primary protective factors and promoters of resilience among all people, especially in marginalized communities like the LGBTQ community. Knowing that such a prevalent disorder is common among these populations and affects one of the main factors contributing to those individuals’ ability to adjust successfully and to their well-being, comes with the responsibility of better understanding that disorder, its impact on that population, and how to intervene to reduce assuage its negative effects. This project reviewed prevalence rates of social anxiety disorder (SAD) among the college student population and the LGB population to estimate the prevalence of SAD within the LGB college student population. This project also explored the risk factors of SAD for college students and LGB people to investigate the risk factors of SAD for LGB college students. Finally, this project reviewed protective factors and prevention strategies for SAD among LGB people to consider the clinical application for LGB college students, including therapeutic, social, and community interventions. Clinical implications and recommendations for future research are included",
